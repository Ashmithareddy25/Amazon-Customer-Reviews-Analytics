B000B68V6I|5|A bigger bottle than I'm used to but now I know I won't run out!
B004RCWZ2S|4|Works fine:)
B000ALG09O|5|Great product and great service. Parts had been impossible to locate locally but finally found them on Amazon.
B004TCSVU6|4|The light was easy to install and works great. I wish it had a better looking lens cover like the factory lens, but it's still a good product.
B00FSIN0U6|1|We installed this bulb for our RV porch light and are very pleased with the light it provides. Update 3/26/16: This light has burned out all of the diodes with occasional use. The diodes burned out 1 by one reducing the brightness over the year. Luckily, I saved the old bulb to use in its place... The attached image should show several diodes burned out. I would like to know if I am the lone individual with a problem with this product. I am changing my rating to 1 because of the failure. Cheers,
B0057V41NY|5|Easy to put on nice and sweet. You will like them on your bike but they are small just so you know
B0051SEA5C|4|Its a soft plastic bottle w/a  scale on it. it does what it supposed to. A fancy measuring cup..<br />but the cap seal is a bit weak allows it to either 'pop' off if squeezed of seep.<br /><br />Now we all know that its gonna be oil in here, messy smelly stroke oil, so keep it in a secure place.<br /><br />To perfect this abetter cap w/ more threads would be nice & maybe somehow designing the cap to pour easier/neater/cleaner.<br /><br />Using this for pre-mix on muy jet ski I fill up on the water, this means I travel w/ it full of oil & then pour into the tank while gassing up in the inlet. Let's just say it could be messy pouring this into the tank when your sitting on the dock & your ski is bibbing  around from the waves/swells.<br />Carrying rags, a funnel & a place to keep this becomes a bit much. KISS- Works, take your time, store upright where it wont get squeezed & your ok. Same as all the others on the market, way easier than the Rite cup thing.
B00NXRYG3E|5|Excellent quality, fit perfect and took less than 5 minutes to put them on!  You receive the entire wiper (not just the blades), take your old ones off and snap the new ones on and you're all set!
B004TRKBOK|5|My husband's new truck is totally high tech BUT if he needed in an emergency to break out the windows this is the tool to have! I brought several to give as Christmas presents.
B00JO8XLAU|5|Excellent service and very good product
B00CGGXRK6|5|works well and looks good on my truck.  easy to install
B00FT6AKH8|2|It was way too buff for my standard mini
B0049MGOSM|4|Very nice for the price. Shipping was fast. Installed it this AM in about 2 hours while on a lift. Add an hour or so if you do not have a lift. The sound is great. Not loud at all but you can now tell you have an exhaust. Easily carried on a conversation in the cab at any degree of power with no drone. One problem, the front pipe ahead of the muffler was about an inch and a half short. We had to bend the hanger rod to get the pipe to fully seat into the existing oem extension pipe. Once we did that, the rest was just making adjustments. Make sure you leave everything loose enough to make final adjustments. The instructions are not the best, in fact they were not in the package, I had to copy from internet.<br />I would certainly buy again or recommend to a friend.
B0045NK4YK|5|Wonderful grease, have been using it forever and have no problem with getting it from Amazon cause short of running it over with a truck or similar vehicle they can't hurt it. As always, as this review does not speak very negativly about Amazon it quite possibly will not be censored. Would not want to get the truth out there now would we?
B00HR5PGZ0|1|9mm Not 7mm<br />un-useable
B003INQ8DE|3|I've used the one-piece, palm sized Inverters and never had much luck w/ them when it comes to powering my Laptop. After I realized the difference between the Modified & Pure Sine Wave output, I purchased this model hoping that the cleaner & higher power output would do the trick. It DOES power my Laptop, but the cursor is erratic, therefore making mouse operation difficult. I rely on this inverter to CHARGE my Laptop, then unplug & run off of battery while Laptop is in use. MAYBE my Laptop is the problem, but it works fine w/ other comparable Inverters.
B0055DR3FW|5|These glasses won't come off, and they are really comfortable. I really like them alot and wear them almost every day. Good for indoors wear, also, because of the lens.
B00AN45BXO|5|Very pleased with product and how fast it got to me.
B00CB1U3CQ|5|he is the best in my opinion. he really knows his craft. he is a very good business man for sure.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Excellent Product and clay bar seves additional purpose of removing headlight residue
B00B2DM386|5|Very good item<br /><br />Seems solid and pretty high quality.<br /><br />Measure your steering wheel accurately and order the right size.<br /><br />If you have a hard time fitting it on your wheel, contact the seller and ask them.<br /><br />Item looks good
B002TUZW8Y|5|Very nice product
B007TG7HVS|3|OK
B009KUFCL8|4|I was a bit disappointed with the light gauge (thickness) of the aluminum. Felt like a beer can. I suppose you get what you pay for, but they sure charged a lot for shipping for such light items.
B00757E7LE|5|You lose a little bit of reception that is only noticeable in the outskirts here in Vegas. I wouldnt get it if you are already having issues with reception. If your radio is already crystal clear then expect no changes.
B0016ZBP1Q|5|works great, no problems, water heater working again
B000E301B6|1|Unfortunately I purchased this part for my vehicle, believing (falling for) the advertisements and product hype but was unable to use part as it leaked more the OEM part.  First the part is not made in the USA, it is from China.  Second, the hard lines going from the crimped rubber connection to the radiator are mis-bent.  Third, the crimps are the same as used by the OEM.  Fourth, the upper quick-connect for the radiator needed to be forced into the radiator port because it was slightly larger than was supposed to be, causing a massive leak.  Forget the 50K mile OEM leakage claim which they proudly say they beat - they didn't last 5 seconds w/o leaking let alone 50K miles!!  This despite all of the Q.C. passed stickers and such in the packaging.  I later found many, many owners who bought these lines had the same issue or the lines let go after very few miles.  Horrible - recommend getting the OEM part or if looking for a cheaper alternate go with the NAPA brand - it's Chinese too but better than the Dorman.
B000JFJLP6|5|Clore's only make quality products
B000CQBMQI|4|excelente producto
B0031B89UI|1|TOOK THEM A WEEK TO EVEN SHIP THE TUBE AND IT WON'T HOLD AIR,
B001S21LJ8|5|This works perfectly. Not to hard to install. You can tell the difference in sound and a little more umph right off the bat.
B00C0UAAOE|5|This fit perfectly on my 2002 4Runner limited. All the parts were included and it was an exact match. My old bell cranks were rusted and would stay pulled tight if the E-brake was pulled. I would have to bang them back out to get the tension to release. They don't mention it but the kit I received came with a packet of heavy silicone grease to lube the pivot joint inside the rubber boot.
B00IAGY2WS|5|Looks and feels great, good quality! Fits my '05 Subaru WRX perfectly. Very ergonomic, IMO more so than the standard STI shift knob.
B000BYRHIS|5|she loves it
B00CHELDEY|5|I see lots of people in my rearview mirror laughing at this sticker at red lights. It went on very easily and looks very nice.
B00K33WQE2|5|Delivery was quick and packaging was in good shape.<br /><br />The radiator bolted right on and is a really good fit, looks good as well. It is quite a bit thicker than the stock radiator so the lower radiator hose was a little tougher to get on next to the steering box but from under the truck i was able to slip it on.
B001U9BMD4|5|Words to live by
B0047RV8WG|5|Super fast shipping...got them before expected...they have a nice bluish tint to them....highly recommend! They fit perfect in my 2010 Cadillac Escalade parking light
B00CO24Y90|4|Almost the same as factory, worked fine.
B00DD102X8|5|I have a crew cab, used in rear fits good. Good solid rubber and the price is right. I recommend it.
B004WMDXRE|5|I got everything I needed to fix the stupid/cheap HHR door handle.  Except you do also need the right torx driver (right bit used in conjunction with cordless drill is what I used).  After watching a little youtube video, I was all set to use it, and successfully fixed my HHR door.  I don't think my wife could do it, but I had no problems aside from stubbornness of fasteners when removing/replacing parts.  Far better than having to take it to the dealer to get it fixed.
B004VFX3AE|4|&#34;Just like honey&#34; is the best way to describe this product's consistency!  It is pretty thick and clear, which means it doesn't spread as easily as you'd want.  I found myself putting more on the rag than I envisioned I'd have to.  This would be the downside of Leather Honey, in my opinion.  I wish it was a little thinner for that reason and for the price, it would last longer, but I'm sure there is a good reason they made it this way.  I will say that after applying it, our leather furniture looks sleek as new.  There is no strong lingering odor either -- it is quite literally as natural smelling as honey is.  I'm happy with the purchase and would definitely buy it again!
B00FK336QW|5|Great product, works well in the cold. Easy to remove while riding.
B005J43I56|5|Love this clever mount!
B000VKRQA6|5|Thank goodness.  If this hadn't fixed the problem i would have been pissed, because changing it was a pain in the ass.  Of course, i didn't know what the heck i was doing.  I was surprised to find a large amount of leafy/seeds and crap that had been deposited into the filter area.  Holy crap man.
B00D2KKPW8|5|Fits and works as advertised.
B009RLB4Z8|5|It worked well and I didn't have to many issues. The only thing I ran into was the bluetooth on my phone.
B009SK7N8K|5|you get what ya pay for- as the headline says. Its a cheap switch and looks and feels like it. However I am only using for a 36w light bar so it is perfect for my application.
B0031I1ZH0|5|This cover is thicker and better than the previous 2 or 3 covers I ´ve had . It feels better made from the moment you touch the fabric. A lot better -  It fits perfect on a polaris 250 . small size.  Exceed my expectations . I was looking for a strong but not expensive cover , since I live in a very hot place and this one seems to be the right choice. And the price is unbeateable.
B0024NSMAG|5|On time - perfect fit - Awesome!  Best price seen on the internet compared to $150/lamp this was a steal for the set
B000C57K9M|1|I really thought... what a great deal...for such a cheap price...once installed they looked great...sat high at first..the next week my struts had sank a whole inch... im so upset ... I will never buy struts from amazon again
B000F14B7C|5|Fit great. Fast shipping.
B00FG2MZXM|5|Great product and very fast shipping, allowing me to do my tune up the next weekend just as I had planned...thank you very much and will use again and again.
B003O0YO0U|5|Works well on 2004 Acura MDX.  Easy to install yourself.
B00Q8ENZO0|2|Delivery was good and ahead of time, the product itself is either poor quality or I got a lemon, didnt use or unbox it untill I went to the lake for the 4th.<br />Checked the boat batteries  and it failed on the second battery, it was already past the return date
B00DNX92TQ|5|Cheap, useful... I used it every day and it is a great product for its price! I really recommended for any activity.
B00527KTPM|5|Very happy with my transaction aswell as my exaust it fits and looks sweet! The seller was very friendly and communicated as a seller should. Highly recommended products
B001LHVOVK|4|This thing gets the job done pretty quick and easy. I was able to get one code which gave me an idea of what was up. However, when I took my car to the shop they were able to find two other codes this thing missed. Either way it finds the codes and will give you a good idea of what is wrong.
B007P743K4|5|This is my third one
B0043WKESE|5|Great in use, strongly recommended very good quality, great performance, It is worth buying it.It is been one year that car is running  great with out any trouble.
B0073XMXMK|5|Installed in 5 seconds. Good reception. I definitely recommend it.
B00404WDUC|5|WELL BUILT.  There is no other way to put this.  It works great, I love how accurate it is, and to what resolution.  It's a cinch to take a measurement, too.  And last, but not least, this thing is build solid as a tank.  I absolutely love this thing!
B001LHVOVK|5|Very good deal. Read codes from a Chevy and from an Acura with same results as a reader that costs $600. Very Satisfied.
B002XL2IEA|5|Plugs the hole and more!  Much nicer than the plastic plug.  Should be standard equipment on all campers and motor homes.
B000ELP7TY|5|So far so good, we'll see how it long it last with headers right by it.
B000TKHMWK|1|I have a Powerpack 600 that I bought about 9 months ago and have used it twice and tonight it wouldn't work at all. I charged it for two days prior to tonight and all I got was the stupid tone you get when the battery is dead. I bought it to play music and run a small PA for wedding ceremonies.  The first time I used it was to test it and I got about 2 hours running a Peavey Escort 2000. The 2nd time I got only an hour and a half. It abruptly stopped right before \\"I do\\". That sucked but tonight, nothing!  I would recommend that you do not buy one of these!!!
B000NCOKZQ|5|I bought several of these to install on mowers, my tractor and a generator.  Alligator clips can be unreliable and are easy to knock off and short out if not careful.  Now with these installed on all my equipment its a &#34;snap&#34; to hook up to my battery chargers or battery Minders/Tenders.  The inline 7.5 Amp mini-fuse came in handy when I did a no-no once when connecting up some batteries in series and got some wires mixed up, the fuses blew and saved my charging equipment from any damage.  I would buy this again.
B00E0UMNAQ|5|Having made an oops on my $800 trunk lid I purchased two of these and put them over the inadvertent hole and added a matching one on the other side. Looks like it was a planned addition versus covering an $800 mistake.
B00KTIQAZW|4|I took out the pad and put it in the one I have. And now mine works again
B001OZL9RI|5|I have run this in the past and am now running it in my Triglide. My bike valve train runs quieter and the motor runs cooler here in Florida.
B000TVM0EY|5|Love this product! Just spray it on your bike then wash it off with cold water. Works great, easy to use!
B003NYOSHG|5|Great little package of stickers. They came in perfect condition.
B004RCOUP8|5|I bought this because I did not have one and everyone should experience the Valterra A01-0020VP Brass 90° Lead-Free Hose Saver at least once in their lifetime.  I was not disappointed; the product was exactly as described.  I cannot comment on the longevity or long-term durability of the product, I got bored with it quickly and used it to toss at my neighbor’s cat while it was in my yard taking a dump... and it worked very well for that, the cat has not pinched a loaf in my yard ever since then.  Great product, 5 stars.
B0014COKYU|5|Great for boat cleaning
B000COC0GQ|1|I removed and returned all K&N air filters because independent studies found it does not filter as well as oem. you can void the warranty using these filters. K&N says that there filter has less restriction on air flow which is true but to say that an oem filter restricts or starves the engine for air is crazy. Dirt is getting through these filters and the oem lets less dirt through. Although no filter is 100% K&N leads you to believe that you get more horse power and cleaner air from their filter which just isn't true for normal car engines. These filters are sold under pure hype and incomplete information. [...]
B00ILE34J6|5|I have my angel on my visor and I love to flip my visor and see my angel and the inspirational message, brings a smile to my face. I ordered it a while back and I think it took longer than I had hoped for it to arrive.
B000CMHTXW|5|the mud flaps fit good and were made to fit the molding design good. they were easy to installon the truck
B006G6VDQC|3|Not as bright as my previous ones
B0056OFWVM|5|Where on Earth have these things been? Holy cow these make tying down loads so much easier than ever before!<br /><br />I use these on light to medium loads; I wouldn't use the for heavy duty applications (obviously) but for securing gear like rolling carts, speaker cabinets, bikes, and furniture inside my trailer, these things can't be beat.<br /><br />Now the trick is to be patient when using these. If you are one of those kinds of people that is always in hurry or just blasts through tasks, these can get a little bit twisted as they retract. My advice: take your time securing and releasing these straps. You'll be greatful you did.
B00BU44TOI|4|Very cool, maybe a 1/2 to 1 MPG better.
B000JZN0SU|1|I actually bought these from a local auto parts store. This was about a year ago. It started raining out of no where and my old blades were not helping. Right out of the box these worked \\"ok\\". Within a few months they were streaking, by the time the wet season ended they were totally ineffective. They actually made things worse.
B003ZA7HUS|1|Broke very quickly.  It was never dropped and I released the pressure after use.  Something in the spray mechanism got stuck or broke so it shoots contents when under pressure.  I bought this before I realized I could go to the garden section of the home improvement store and get cheaper ones that so far have worked for 30-40 uses (uses defined as spraying water or waterless wash on cars to clean them).
B00CBZCAHI|5|thanks
B000Z0HVHA|5|Good quality product for the price. Highly recommend.  Thank you.
B00F7H0NV2|1|Doesn't stick very well, could have saved my money.
B00131RBWA|5|It is really easy to install, and it fit perfectly with my Camry.<br />About the design, it really depends. Personally, I like the design very much. Better than the advertisement the deal installed on my car. :P
B00HAPGNAE|4|Fits  the Suzuki Alto  RA410
B002FSATC4|5|The wife needed new shocks and struts on her car. These were what we needed at a decent price. So far, the ride is very smooth and we're happy with the purchase.
B002WIS6AO|5|The item arrived on time. It was exactly as posted and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend this vendor to all.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Bought one for our Dodge Charger and Chev Cruze. Fits both well and noticeably keeps the heat reduced. Also love that it folds us and fits nicely tucked in between the seat and console slot.
B00BQXJX08|5|good buy
B000AAMY86|4|Nice and usefull unit. It tracks my MPG and gives me my coputer codes I need to isolate problems. The Manual coul use a little more work, it is hard to understand the higher functions.
B000QCM5NM|4|This works just as described the only con to it is that it is about 1 or 2 mm shallower than where it should sit to be inline with the other pulleys on the engine. I still have it on and i have had no problems.
B00138OMJI|5|I already had some so i ordered some for a friend the best tie downs on the market..
B005ALAMWU|5|I don't even know why I would need to describe why I bought these and why I rated it a 5. I mean come on it is Transformers you can't go wrong with Transformers. Thanks for a great product and they look awesome on the Jeep!!! Can't wait to order the bigger ones for the back.
B0041TVWV2|5|Best price anywhere! I was honestly impressed with the quality of the product. Fit and functioned perfectly. Let's see how it holds up.
B005IUYXXM|4|Great goggle for the price. Von Zipper is a great brand and this pair is perfect fit for my girlfriend. The mirrored lens is fairly dark but makes for good day time eye wear. Might want to invest on a yellow lens if you are going to be riding mostly at night but I find these will work for both day and night. Would buy again.
B000NWA8HU|5|Works very well....fit right in no problems....have had it in for some time now and all is well......works like a charm.....
B008G1WT0Y|5|excellent
B001C3XD0S|5|This cup holder is so nice to have.  Now I don't have to worry about losing my drink while on a ride.
B00AB44GW8|5|fits well, very good quality<br />just one problem with the side fender because it curved... 2 small cuts and you fix that problem
B002IZKDHK|5|After reading some of the reviews about receiving an alternate item (more specifically receiving a 30amp to 30amp pigtail model 14376 and a 15amp to 30amp adapter model 14101) I was a bit concerned as to whether or not I would receive the proper item.  My purchase was from Amazon, rather than a 3rd party vendor, and was exactly as described.
B00LRKV826|5|I love the color AND it glows in the dark!  #WIN
B00E1SONIW|5|great fit
B0077HB9SQ|4|These are super strong and I actually have somewhat of a hard time closing my back glass now, but it's a heck of a lot better than trying to reach into the rear cargo area and having the glass fall down on your head. I will buy from this company when replacing the hatch lifts for sure.
B00412YT8W|5|Excellent item and more perfect then I can type here. It fits perfect and replaces the original item for perfect operatikon.<br /> I will order the other one for the passenger side soon.<br />Thanks.
B0047DIGIY|1|Purchased these for my 2011 Avalon. The ride was smooth and firm for the first thousand miles. Ride became soft, body roll increased, ride height decreased and I began to feel every bump in the road. There are not alot of suspension options out there for the Avalon. KYB's appear to be the strongest and only other option. Try anything else but Monroe.
B005R3SSMW|5|This is an excellent well made steel tool that fully engages with the oil filter of my 2010 Toyota corolla (4 cyl), including the tabs on the side. It was so tight that it literally took everything I had to loosen it, the conventional tool would never have worked. Standard tools simply popped off long before I could get enough torque applied.
B00BMDZ2B6|3|The fender emblems can easily be applied and not to be worried about too much, but I can't say I'm very pleased with the grille emblem. All it is, is one of the fender emblems stuck to the metal piece by the adhesive backing. That just seems cheap and lazy.<br />Now I'm going to have to find some way to keep it from easily being pulled off by emblem snatchers.
B0049E54G8|2|When my mechanic got around to installing this unit after engine start up he noticed a small leak. There was a small leak in the sheet metal part not from a weld.  After obtainig an OEM/Toyoto oil pan we could tell the poor quality of this unit.  The weight of the OEM pan was almost twic as heavy and the visual quality really was apparent.<br /><br />The second instance with this pan happened when he removed the provided pan drain plug.  The plug broke off the unit at the weld.<br /><br />I did not get around to installation during the warranty return time window but returned anyway.  We will see what they say.<br /><br />It would have been nice to know the steel thickness of this pan compared to the OEM pan.  I woould not have mind paying 80% of the OEM price if I knew it was OEM quality.
B00AAYG6EU|4|Changes the whole look of the cluster. Works good so far
B0007IJR1I|5|Working Good. Remove water spot on my car windows.<br />My car had worst waterspot many years<br />I try everything to remove waterspot but ....<br />This is best best best.save me money .... Thanks
B00JLEJ2UK|5|Everything seems to be working fine
B008G2CSSG|5|Excellent product, shipping & price! Highly recommended.
B00E6VLVXO|2|Customer service was great on my refund so I bumped this to two , but this unit is currently regulating at 16.5v new out of the box; which is 2-3volts higher than it should, and high enough to cook a battery.
B00CB0459E|5|Had them on my 2013 Challenger R/T for 8 months and very happy with this purchase. Deep throaty sound, but not overwhelming obnoxious. Glad I bought Solo.
B00FTB2NFA|4|Works like a charm. Hope to get a lot of use from them. Looks like good quality parts. Installs and fits easily.
B005CXKNWU|5|For the price you can't beat it. With Amazon prime it was able to arrive sooner than what it says
B00BYH6C1E|5|This is a great product! I have, in the past, dropped many things in the gp between the the center consul and the seat. Some were never found. Most recently, my drivers license.<br />I saw this product on &#34;Shark Tank&#34;. Good going guys!
B009XISF6G|5|awesome look, awesome sound, awesome bhp and torque increase. if you split lanes when you ride they will definitely hear you coming. If you like the set of the car alarms in your apartment complex this will do that too.<br />be careful with the law they are racing pipes
B002XJL92Y|5|We've had this sticker on the back of our car for 1 full year in the Texas sun.  It still looks great.  Excellent quality and value.
B0002NIJQC|5|Fit great. Little trimming to fit as these are universal!
B004S4727S|3|....thinner flimsier metal than I thought. The car wash trashed it. Very nice item though. Maybe I should have put it in a frame(?) Go Dutch!
B00079ZF68|5|At the beginning I doubted when ordering it, because of the reasonable price, but when I received it, I see that it is worth the price, I like the fine quality of the leather, it looks pretty nice and it has so much presence.
B006FYI5WU|5|They fit my 2010 Jeep JKU perfect, no modifications
B004ZF39T0|5|Not a big fan of Slim H.I.D but these have been working awesome.
B008X02JJO|5|Much better.
B007BV93X6|5|Love it...it exceeded expectations and arrived earlier than expected. The bag is holding up to rough teenage treatment very well.
B004N6YRDS|3|It worked for all of 30 minutes, and then killed my battery. Once I replaced my battery, the kit no longer worked. Customer service was very kind and offering a new control box, but that failed as well. Returned it to Amazon.
B00F4MUYN2|3|•From a quality standpoint, I would rate it good to excellent.  The vest is of very nice leather and looks good on.<br />•I am very pleased with fit (as expected, if not just slightly small, but feels good snug).  I measured and ordered according to recommend size and it does fit snug with a t-shirt, but would not fit with a flannel shirt underneath.  If you plan on riding with more than a t-shirt under this, and you are at the upper extreme on size range, order one size bigger.  The neck is more pleasing than my previous v-cut vest as it keeps my shirt more secure during riding.<br />•Lots of pockets.<br />•Zipper and snaps are good quality so far.  No issues or concerns.  Even with my girth.<br /><br />But… This is supposed to be a CCW bike vest, so I have to also grade on that.  I did purchase this specifically for that reason, and here is where I have issues with the vest.<br />•It has two inside pockets for the firearm, one on each side as expected, so works good for normal people and for southpaws.  :)<br />•The holder for the firearm is an elastic strap, which you will have to fit a small/soft cloth holster into and then have the elastic strap hold the holster via the belt clip.  I don’t know what I was expecting, but I don’t like this method for holding the firearm.  It does hold my small 3.3” barrel okay (single-stack semi-auto, 26oz loaded), but my 4.5” barrel pistol does not fit at all; the holster would not fit and without the holster the pistol was not held secure; the larger pistol was also too bulky due to weight, which the vest could not comfortably support.  Because this method holds the pistol vertical (barrel down), drawing, even from an already open pocket, is tricky.  I would have preferred an internal Velcro system, as I’ve seen on other similar vests.  I should have researched this better, but as this is my first CCW vest, again, I’m not sure what I was expecting.  Revolver, in a soft holster, also holds secure, but no good method of holding reload strips or spare ammo.<br />•The same elastic strap method is used for the extra magazine holder (one each carry pocket), however the magazine has to go directly into the elastic strap, which is too big for EVERY pistol magazine I own, even the bigger ones I would never consider carrying in a vest.  The strap should have been smaller so it could stretch over the magazine and hold it more firmly in place; I find the magazine falling out of the elastic strap and then ending up in the bottom of the pocket.  Big no-no and I will have to figure out how to solve this issue (if I continue to use it as a CCW vest).<br />•With the pistol in place, the vest (while open) pulls down to one side (weight imbalance).  Not bad, but noticeable to me, but not so much as it would invalidate the vest if all other considerations were equal.  With a pistol in the inside holster/pocket, the firearm does not print -- average Joe passing by would not suspect there is something in there.<br />•My final critique has less to do with the vest proper and simply the method by which it operates as a “holster.”  You will not draw your weapon quickly from this vest.  With the vest closed, you have to unsnap the vest, unzip the vest, then unsnap the inside pocket to get into the pistol,then again, draw is awkward.  I typically open the vest when not on the bike, so it would be a bit faster, but only marginally, getting to the firearm proper out is still somewhat convoluted, which I don’t think would be the case if the pistol were more at an angle, but then again that is a different concern.  I do not think you could safety draw while on the bike at all, and would not try.<br /><br />Overall, I like this vest as a bike vest.  I do NOT like this vest as a CCW bike vest.  Because I have other methods of carry, I will be keeping the vest for the bike, and think that even a better CCW vest would have many of the same concerns, however, if this vest were mysteriously eaten by a shark, I would not buy it again.<br /><br />Ride safe.  Carry responsibly…
B007ZFSM6M|5|Great quality sticker!
B00T2GT9L4|5|I saw its potential, as have an older car and am a widow...there's no one  to call.  as it turned out I hadn't opened the box yet, when my BFF called me because her battery died!  it wa a great practice, her car started up in no time.  I love it and she also bought one!
B00B7R09SS|5|Installation was a breeze, they fit perfect, and they work great.  They make soft top installation and removal as easy as a walk in the park.
B0041U3LIS|5|Broke a Tail Light on my 2010 Toyota Tacoma Sport and this was a direct replacement, fastest shipping with the best price I could find yes I would recommend this. Fits great looks great.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Well made, easy to install, Just barely long enough to be useful.
B000CAY88S|5|These rotors were a great saving over buying at the local store. It included free shipping and no tax. THe local discount store would have cost almost 70% more. Installed them myself with new pads. Been working great for the last 2 months. No squeaking and rust spots (normal on many rotors) are minimal. By the way, I dont recommend changing your own brakes unless you know what you're doing. You dont want to brake and have a wheel fall off.
B000C5BVYM|5|Fits perfect on 2005 Mustang V6
B00029J3AW|3|I know it is a thrush and it isn't going to be as quiet as stock by any means...but was still way louder than I had hoped.  Seems to be a nice heavy gauge of steel though...
B002ETKH1M|5|perfectly fit my Isuzu i-280 took me 5 minutes to install no tools required. I am happy with this purchase.
B000FPY934|5|Great service from Omix-Ada and the bumper fits and looks great!
B00CA975R0|5|This kit fit perfect and would recommend it due to cost is much less then others
B000KYXC7Y|4|This one does not come programmed. For my car, i was not able to get it programmed by the technical support team. I took it to a well known locksmith and he got it programmed in just about 2 minutes and it works fine. The buttons are smooth, so you might accidently press the button and your car may start beeping.
B000CG12RM|5|If you are looking for a tough  reliable, and  impossible to cut open lock. then this is the lock for you.! Master Lock has out done themselves with this lock and the bracket it fits into sold separately. Every penny spent on this lock and the bracket are well worth it. You do need to buy the master-lock bracket that goes with it. . I actually was surprised you had to seek out the bracket, but looking under Master Lock it was easy to find. This round lock is really ingenious with the security bars to attach to the bracket are placed in the back -inside. When you turn the key as to open it, the bars slides down inside. The protruding bracket fits inside the back of the lock that is open. When you turn the key the bars raise through the holes in the bracket  and now it is secure. It is possible to cut the bars, and is virtually impossible to tamper with.
B00EA6TD6M|5|Right on time, just what i expected. I would recomend it.
B000E32290|1|I've bought and had warranty exchange on 3 of these just this winter. My original went out due to the common transfer case seal failure and overfilling, 4wd vacuum routing switch allowing trans fluid to get into the actuator ruining it.  I replaced all the faulty parts including seal, switch (I could mention my dorman vac switch was faulty  off the shelf and had to be replaced) all the vacuum lines (major pain) and brand new dorman actuator. just over a month and that one went (no fluid in it) warranty replaced only to have it last less then a month. another warranty and 6 weeks later tore out on me again. nothing rubbing or touching it just a failure of the rubber diaphragm- right near the crimp on the base every time. gotta be a better part out there- at least get a winter or two out of one?! I plow about 10-12 driveways with this truck, not to mention normal truck duties. i guess I got what I paid for. should have bought the expensive one.<br />JC
B00JIIZCM6|5|works very well
B00MFY61IO|1|Ordered a used one that was oem and received a new one (cheap fake remake with a sticker on it) will be sending back
B000X3NMQS|5|Good
B0027RSOWU|5|This is a Denso remanufactured unit, and it worked well for my Toyota 4.7 liter engine.
B00I3W6FR4|5|Thanks
B00BD62X9Q|5|Works great. There is voltage on all of the pins, but when connected to the trailer the resistance apparently makes the system work properly. I did not wire directly to my battery as my 2011 Rav4 has a DC outlet in the back compartment, so I purchased a DC adapter and spliced it together. It cost me a little more, but only took me a couple of minutes to install.
B00020CATC|3|I really don't know if this helped out my sound issues but I installed this in my Goldwing and did not notice any discernible difference.<br /><br />For the record, I'm a musician for almost 25 years and VERY savvy when it comes to sound and electronics. I was hoping I would have some noticeable improvement in rear speaker bass but I did not. As a musician, I do know how important sound proofing is so Im sure this stuff dint hurt.
B008PD8D12|3|These don't last that long for me and are too stiff
B001CO2JGG|5|Fits perfectly with the right measurements
B005MKA742|5|It works great. Haven't had any issues with it. Looks great too and that's always a plus. It's sleek and maintains well. Also, easy to use and sturdy.
B002GP87NO|4|This product came in a decent amount of time, and it looks super cool on my ford escort zx2. I have ordered another sticker cause the first one looked so super cool
B005NLQAHS|1|I plugged this in to my2004 Corvette z06, nothing lit up except I got about a dozen OBD2 error codes spread across many modules that were not there previously. I check them on my car every week.<br /><br />Also got messages &#34;Service Engine Soon&#34; and &#34;Operating at reduced power&#34;<br /><br />This is a piece of junk I will be returning it. Worst product I ever got on Amazon.
B00E5PK8TE|5|Price is right! Super fast shipping.
B005QZJG5O|5|Excellent
B003KL72E8|5|I purchased this product for my new truck and really like it. It cleans very well and leaves a pleasant scent. I will definitely use it again.
B0002CO9LW|5|Just had 2 of these lights installed on my roof rack along with 2 KC driving lights, and I absolutely love them. These lights are incredible, the slim black finish and cage guards are very sleek and well built. They are super bright, especially with 4 of them in a row. Lights of this quality are definitely worth spending the extra money on, especially when I've had other plastic lights that don't hold a candle to these in terms of performance or ruggedness/durability. I'm really glad I went with KC.
B00CLRRI6E|4|I DO NOT BLAME THE SUPPIER BUT THIS PRODUCT (WHICH I AM SURE I WILL NEED TO ORDER AGAIN) IS NOT MADE WELL, BUT THE SUPPIER IS NOT TO BLAME, AS IT IS AN EXACT REPLACEMENT TO THE FACTORY PIECE, AND IN THAT MANNER I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE ITEM. SO TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE IN AND SAY THAT THIS ITEM IS BAD (AND SOME HAVE) AGAIN IT IS NOT THE SUPPIERS FAULT, THEY HAVE DESCRIBED THE ITEM GREAT, AND IT IS A PERFECT FIT AS IT MIRRIRS THE FACTORY PEICE.<br />AND THE ONLY REASON I DO NOT GIVE A 5 STAR REVIEW IS THAT THE &#34;ITEM&#34; IS BAD NOT THE SUPPIER (SORRY SUPPIER)
B004X184GE|5|Product was exactly what I wanted. Perfect for my pickup and very easy to apply. Would buy again in a heartbeat
B001GJ3E8Y|4|I bought this to actually clear the grout in my shower (on the advice from a cleaner). It worked really well, much less of a headache than a sponge or something.
B0002LBKEW|5|This stuff is amazing! Put 2 cap fulls in a bucket of water and wash your car then while wet use a nickel size drop to polish... it may take several to cover the car. No buffing, just wipe dry (micro-fiber cloths) and your done for at least 6 months! I'll never go back to polish again!............=D
B000BO6MFC|5|Nice product.  Sprayed on easily - no clumps or drips. Made a difference in the feel and shine of the leather.<br /><br />I'd recommend taking measures to prevent the overspray from getting on your floors and carpets.  I have tile under the furniture, and the overspray made the tile slippery.  Not a fault of the product, of course, just common sense.
B004FKV852|2|It was stubbier than I thought it would be, and doesn't really give me any added sun protection.
B002O95M3K|5|2005 dodge ram worked perfectly  , no more flicker only thing is my lamp out light is still on but I expected it to be because I have a low beam only hid kit ... If you have low beams only your lamp out will remain on but I couldn't be happier
B006LOFBYO|5|great product, highly recommend buying it
B0060YI0YS|3|These little guys do exactly what they're supposed to do.  Makes a bad fitting connection into a perfect connection in a minute.  Could probably have found them cheaper somewhere locally, but it was just too convenient not to add them to an existing order and have them shipped for free.<br /><br />Update on my original review:  I need to take away a couple of stars and add the comment that \\"one size does not fit all\\".  I only used one of the pair that came in the package when I wrote my original review---since then I found a use for the other one on a different vehicle, and it just plain wouldn't fit the combination of battery post and connector.  Just too big to work, even with a fair bit of forcing.  It was a very sloppy fit on the battery post and I couldn't expand the connector enough to get the adapter/post into the aperture properly.  Wound up distorting the shape so badly that I had to discard the piece and resort to another fix to solve that loose connection problem.<br />Still happy with the way it solved my first problem, so it was money well spent, but it obviously won't work for every battery/connector combination.
B000WJ90X2|5|all ram mounts that ive ordered have worked great on motorcycle,truck,bus,ian never loosens up, even with 2 items on 1 ball, i suggest if u want sumthing to last try these.[ive never used chrome 1]
B001TMEIZQ|5|Good quality
B002WRRNFO|4|I have read some talk about the size. I put a Sig Sauer P226 40/.357 sig in it successfully. I would point out that the fit was exact. The tip of the barrel touched the side and the sights touched the top. there was zero movement side to side, but it did fit. The height was good. I could have fit two p226s' in there, one on top of the other, not that I would. For a smaller CC weapon it would be fine. I am confident it will be a good box for short term parking of the piece while your swimming or otherwise engaged in activity that precludes you from carrying. It does not lend itself to being bolted or otherwise more securely being fastened to the car, or where ever. It depends on the cable locking pin to make it immobile and, as with any cable, a pair of bolt cutters or hack saw and it is gone(but still locked). There is a locking pin included that does not have a cable attached so you can simply secure it without the cable hanging off it if you desire.
B00200EFJA|5|This is a spray. As another reviewer said, think WD-40. It is definitely not as thick as the conventional lithium grease that you scoop out in dollops.<br /><br />HOWEVER, it works exactly like lithium grease. It does run a bit but it does not run and drip as freely as WD-40 or similar oil-type sprays. Using the included tip/straw it is very easy to apply directly into the cogs on my gears, and the slight run actually helps it achieve nice even coverage. That little film provides just as good (perhaps better?) lubrication as the thick conventinoal grease.<br /><br />One further note, I have found lower prices in local shops.
B00HFLDLDU|4|Exactly as described by the seller. No wiring diagram is included, but the center post is for &#34;power in&#34; and the other two outer posts control separate items. Only issue was I wish it had some type of protective covering over the contacts, but a few wraps of electrical tape took care of that
B00AN0JBJI|5|Bumper is awesome - packaging is awful. The first one arrived and the bumper had broken through the internal wrapping and the shipping box. In three places the bumper was scraped down to the bare metal. I know it will get banged up on the trail, but I will do that. It shouldn't arrive that way. The reason I went with ARB is my previous bumper lasted 14 years without rusting...They have the best paint/powdercoating out there.  But the bare metal will rust in no time.<br />They sent a replacement bumper and it was the same exact thing. Maybe even worse than the first. Somebody at ARB needs to come up with a better way to wrap this up or sell them at scratch and dent prices.<br />Again, the bumper is awesome.
B00G52L3SK|5|Great replacement same as original
B006AVJPE0|5|I got this mask near august I got it mainly for the fun and the way it looks I loved it it fits my face just right and its super tight! All to say is that I LOVED IT! I wore it around and the way it makes your face look is good but the thing I have problem with is my face got warm every so often cause I wore it for hours but yea it was good.
B0016HQAEQ|4|This is a pretty easy do-it-yourself repair if you have a failing fuel pressure regulator -- a Web search for \\"how to replace FPR on a Hudson Hornet\\" (or whatever your vehicle may be) will quickly provide the necessary information.<br /><br />HOWEVER ... I bought this FPR after replacing the regulator only a few years ago, thinking that the AC Delco version might last longer than its no-name predecessor. Unfortunately, the Delco didn't fix the problem. That's because my fuel pump was failing ... and the symptoms (hard starting) are very similar.<br /><br />If you think your FPR is the problem and it hasn't been replaced in years (or ever), it probably makes sense to try it first (because it's much easier to swap the FPR than a fuel pump). But if, like me, you've already replaced your FPR, do some more research before replacing it again.
B007P4W7O6|4|This is a very nice keychain, good weight in your pocket.  this keychain is very durable and holds a lot of keys. Shipping was fats and very easy to do business with this vendor.
B00GUH8WNY|5|Worked great on my 2004 Trailblazer after $100 to dealer for programming.  Better than paying dealer over $300 just for board.
B002DYH586|3|Not good as a SCHRADER one.<br />Battery has only 3-4 year lifetime.
B009M0S4Z2|5|Just what I was looking for. Very easy to take on and off to clean.
B004PED3E2|5|Best exhaust hands down! Second Borla exhaust I have owned and as long as they make one for my next car I'll continue purchasing them without hesitation. Sound is perfect, I chose the Borla S-Type and it's absolute perfect balance on my 2011 Shelby GT500. Absolutely no drone whatsoever at any speed. After installation I considered the Atak series because these are more tame than I thought. My last exhaust was the touring for my 2010 F150 5.4 and it was truly amazing. Same build quality and same classic Borla sound w no drone and no hollow sounding exhaust like some others.
B000H7XJOK|5|This filter does what all other filters do - filter my oil.  The mfg may say its better than others - I don't care - the price is right and free shipping makes it a bargain.  Comes with new o-ring seal and is easy to install.
B007Y56BNE|5|Fits my 2012 Grand Cherokee perfectly, and it keeps my black interior much less hot when facing our Texas sun.
B00AHJZBCG|2|This was an amazing spotlight ... at first. Charged it up overnight and it was extraordinarily bright. We use it when we let the dog out at night. It was so bright that I took care not to get the light in the dog's eyes. We only used it for a few minutes each night. The charge lasted for the predicted 1 hour at high level (instructions state that at the low level it will last 7 hours, but I did not test that.) After the third re-charge, the light would only stay on for about 30 seconds. I tried charging it, again. Nope, only 30 seconds of light before the red, recharge light came on and the spotlight shut down. Tried one more time and the same results. It was past the 30-day Amazon replacement deadline, so now I'll have to see how responsive the Stanley (actually, the warrantor is listed as Baccus Global, LLC, so it appears that the product just carries a Stanley &#34;badge.&#34;) I'll check back with report about the outcome. I contacted Baccus Global and got a return code. I returned the defective spotlight to Baccus Global (at my expense). About 2 weeks after the defective product reached Baccus, I received a new light in retail packaging. New light works fine, but fingers are crossed that it will survive longer than the first one.
B000CSSQ9M|5|I had quite a bit of trouble finding the exact information for what adapter would fit my 2002 Ford f-150 4.6 (Windsor) engine.  According to Ford (and my VIN) my correct oil filter is a MOTORCRAFT FL-820S.  Unless I am mistaken,this is the correct remote/bypass filter adapter which replaces/cross-references to Mopac part number FL-820S, with 22mm x 1.5mm threads, Height = 3.98\\", Dia = 3.66\\"<br /><br />For further cross reference information for this filter adaptor, please see Fram's online cross-reference guide:<br />[..]<br /><br />Good luck with your projects!
B00KY0E1PQ|5|Great product fit perfect. It charged at 13.80 to 14.oo v .thanks for the fast shipping.
B0010GCYES|5|I did the research first with my VIN number before making the purchase. The part was installed a couple of years ago, after deciding to forfeit the warranty from my mechanic (if purchased through them) and saving myself a huge amount of money.  It has worked perfectly.
B00NAUKZDE|2|Bought for my truck camper. First rain after installation and lens has condensation. Happened to more than one light. I hope they continue to work...
B000BZAAJA|5|Perfect replacement.  This front bearing has made a huge difference in the sound of my car.  My<br />original one was grinding and making a whirling noise.  Thought it was the engine, but the sound<br />was rhythmic and when I checked the free rotation of the wheel I heard the grinding sound.<br />Using forums and Youtube, it was easy to follow instructions on removal and new installation.<br /><br />For my Saturn Vue, the axle nut was 34 mm instead of 36 mm.  I did have to take a couple trips to the<br />automotive store to rent the proper deep well socket.  Had to extend the ratchet arm to increase leverage<br />to remove the nut.  After that, removal and replacement was straightforward.<br /><br />Shipment was sent quickly and was packaged well by the vendor.  Will definitely keep them in mind for<br />other bearing replacement jobs.
B00BSDVF7U|5|I bought this for my daughter's new car and she loves it. It fits perfectly and is sturdy enough to protect the carpet from anything she puts in the back.
B0027XEKQ8|4|Good replacement for my RV. Decent quality for price. Was ten bucks more at a retail store. Buy from Amazon.
B000HBM5S2|5|I use this on my vehicle door hinges and it works very well.  For years I used the white lithium but it left that nasty white build up in the door hinge area, so I tried this and I will continue to use it.  I have to apply it a little more frequently than the white lithium because it a lighter lubricant, but it does the job and doesn't make the door jambs look ugly.
B0051VGEV2|1|Installed this battery in my KFX450R and it fired right up.  After riding for two days, it failed.  Now it only holds 8V and will not charge...  So frustrating!!!
B000C9CDAY|5|It works!
B0052SF0LO|5|Sunforce 82156 60 Led Solar Motion lights are an exellent product. They are bright and easy to install. Glad I bought 4.

B00P9EJGR0|5|Fast shipping--good quality and fit my 2015 Sienna seats.
B002M4GF38|3|The passenger side barely fits,and it's a gap at the bottom of the light also.but the driver side fits just well
B000C5FKH6|5|A perfect fit, nothing beats original parts!
B00496GUC8|4|Its a wiper. A factory wiper. It works. Its cheap. Done deal.
B007630BFI|5|its hilarious that is all i have to say<br />sticks real good<br />but one small factor is it is small but big enough for ppl to see
B005SHL91Y|4|Good product for the price
B006WQSXSW|5|Fit great...works well
B005BNYV2Y|5|Just the best for preventing slipping on steps.
B00JEMPAP0|5|Very pleased with the decals! I only expected one and to my suprise got 3! Very good quality and will definitely get alot of laughs will definitely be ordering more from this seller!
B003TTL0TE|5|Works excellent. Is larger and holds soapy water well. It's made for the slight curves of the car not wheels and stuff.
B007RVR3N2|3|I installed these on a 2000 Cadillac Seville.  On one end the sockets were too small to fit on the hood balls.  Luckily I was able to remove the sockets from the old supports and put them on the new supports.  Note the threads on the old sockets were different than the threads on the new supports.
B00IKMBXY2|4|The new fan face arrived in a few days but was missing the control knob which is pictured. We bought that at an RV place near home. Installed fan face over existing fan and it seems to be working. Haven't had time to test the climate control yet but looks great and helped us sell our camper.
B001P7DP2C|5|It works great on civic, jetta, and Camry. My friends borrowed it couple times. I am going to get another one..
B000OAG2DK|1|Don't know stick wrapped up.
B0010ADH9U|5|It was the right part. It fit like the original. Can't think of anything else to say right now, today.
B005T44AIU|5|I love the way they made our hyundai Sonata look and it has helped to keep mud and yuck from going up the sides of the car.
B00J2CI8K6|3|Very blue which is fine. The plastic housing is far lower quality than standard bulbs and the front retainer rings were loose on arrival. Be sure to tighten them before you install. I could imagine the frustration of fishing the ring out of the light assembly. Let's hope the plastic holds up and the bulbs don't fall out.
B003Y92RUU|5|Laid my bike down on a dirt road and this sucker didn't budge. Very durable.
B000C7VYVU|5|i was worry if it will shipping with CARE it does has care inside the box and it brand new love it also shipping was fast big thanks also it cheaper than stores or other web sites
B000CFO702|5|These bolts worked great, at 2 1/2 &#34; they fit and look great, if I had the money I would change all my bolts to the 12 point style
B005UGHWL4|5|Very high quality riser. Has to be the best anti vibe riser on the market. I would recommend this to anyone looking for more handle bar height.
B003ZIISJE|5|Fast delivery and a great price! Very happy customer
B00J49UDQE|5|I love it. You should buy this product 👍
B000EQ2POO|5|Quality brake pad, fit perfect on toyota rav4 05, better than toyota pad.

B001KSEIJ0|5|Cheaper here than close to home. Exact replacement.
B0000AYEWJ|5|Great security
B0009IQXFO|5|Cleans car really well and smells good too!
B000YC42S0|5|I have a 12 volt Viair compressor and 2-gallon supply tank that were repurposed from another vehicle.  I realized that the supply tank did not have a pressure gauge so ordered this one.  If I recall correctly this gauge was in the $10 price range and since I am an Amazon Prime member, I got free 2-day shipping.<br /><br />This gauge is well made and the graduations are easy to read.  The one thing I didn't realize is that this gauge is intended to be installed in the vehicle dash or in an under dash pod.  In my case I just fabricated a mounting plate and made it a remote mount by adding a 12\\" section of tubing.  Works great for me and as the caption says....  worth the money.
B000Q0U7ES|5|Great product.
B000E5U4R0|4|I bought this a month ago, and  do not know if this is the right time to write a review, The product looks very sturdy and nice. Hope this will work as advertised.
B0038AZM84|5|You know, I might have recognized it if I looked at the car first.  But, I went to the ANZO site.  Their site indicated these fit ZX2.  Found them on Amazon. Their fitment validation indicates they fit ZX2.  When I received them, it was obvious that they will not fit ZX2.  ANZO support said something to the effect that we don't sell many Escort lenses so documentation is low on their list of things to do.  Likely cause is Amazon gets it's fitment information from Anzo.     Amazon return on these was extremely easy though.
B0027AH39W|4|Did a radiator replacement on a 2006 mercury mountaineer. The previous radiator had electrolysis build up within its internals Nad sure enough the radiator ballooned. The transmission cooler lines fit the radiator directly. The engine cooling now functions normally. The manufacturing quality on a scale from 1 to 10 10 being the best is 7. The evidence being on the aluminum fins. Seemed warped do to an impact but in fact warped do to the manufacturing. 10 on the shipping. Ok replacement product compared to a 400$ + USD dealer replacement. Other reviews I've seen complain about a defective part but I quite honestly believe the defect is most likely in an unprofessional installation.
B000GG1MSC|4|Great manual. However there are a little differences in the what the manual shows for parts and what actually is in my 2007 Ford F150. I really like if for bigger jobs like changing out wheel barings and upper and lower controller arms which helped me out tremendously. However, they could also explain somethings in more detail and a better step by step on changing out tranmission filter or transfer case flush... This can be done at home and save a whole lot of money...
B00J13T08A|5|Great service, fast shipping!  Battery works as advertised!
B000OUXTXQ|4|Much better than I expected.
B000N2XORG|5|good
B0053ZKDX6|3|It's much smaller than I anticipated which I suppose is my fault for not clearly looking at the measurements. It's a little bit bigger than a key chain. The colors aren't as vibrant (mostly the blue) as the picture but it's okay for $4.
B0041RV1D8|5|I've had this a couple of winters now.  Takes about sixty seconds to warm up.  Doesn't take up much room in the closet the rest of the year.  Good value.
B00E3EWNVS|5|The size is good for my SUV window.<br />Tip, dip the sucker quickly in hot water, then stick it on your window for a few hours, or a day. Press it little harder, you could feel the click. It will help shape it up. Mine still hang over there for about a week.
B002IWYFVS|5|It's a cool toy, but be careful if you have a backup camera, it blocked mine. wish my camera was different.
B00D68131I|5|my lady and I are huge chivers and she loves her new stickers. them being pink just makes it better for her. keep calm and chive on
B001GG2ENI|5|Bought this for a friend of my mom's and she couldn't wait to put this on her car. She rolls around in her car with PRIDE over her cat obsession!
B005C2OK3O|1|I purchased this product and when it came in all the pieces were not in the package. I can not even put it on my car because of this.
B00332GPMY|5|I have an 06 scion xb. I got these along with a hood bug guard... adds a nice look to the car. Easy install. Just be careful when handling the edges that have the tape on them (the part that slides into the groove). I broke a little piece off and didn't realize before the tape had adhered to the rubber on my window. So that was a little extra I wasn't expecting. Other than that it was simple. I did front windows first and then back windows...only because I wanted to be able t have some windows open while the others stayed closed for the recommended 72 hour seal. Good product. I recommend
B00080QHMM|5|This tire pressure gauge is very usefull and handy. Easy to use, the price is excellent. I highly recommend it.
B000CPI5ZK|1|Well i tried the great water wetter ,02 jepp wrangler Made a 3 hour round trip stop and go situations,I watched the TEMP all the time and i did Not notice any difference at all..So u can try but i wouldnt recommend the stuff..I didnt even see 1 degree difference.
B001GBTFU8|5|Very pleased with the product and delivery times.
B000XBJ61U|5|Have used it before...easy to work with and does the job.
B001AJMOLS|4|It fits the mirrors on my 2005 Silverado fine.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it didn't quite fit until I removed the foam strips from the back of it.  Seems like a good snug fit now, but there is a knack to snapping it on and off.  I haven't tried it out on the road yet, but I expect it to stay on OK and give me that little extra rear view when towing a wide snowmobile trailer.
B00GI78CYK|5|Great quality and fitment. Heck of a lot cheaper than the Recons
B0044B0Z06|5|I am very happy with the quality and economical cost of the cabin air filters for my 2011 Prius. These are hard to find in the part stores so ordering online was a great option.Very Fast Shipping!
B002S47R8Y|5|Awesome light bar! I love how the lights don't just stick up from the roof, that is a weird look to me. With this bar, they sit lower and they have the bar above them which gives it a classier more professional look. Would def buy again! (it was a little tought to install with 1-person, but if you have a buddy it is no problem at all.)
B005VUQWL0|4|I purchased an after market in October 2014 but when the February Freeze hit the handle cracked because of the cheap plastic. You get what you pay for. I will go with &#34;Genuine GM Parts from now on to save humiliation.
B000NKCM2Q|5|I recently installed my K&N Typhoon Kit on my 06 Civic should I say I was very impressed with the performance. Gave me better mileage plus more power at the same time every time I rev it over 3,000 RPM it Roars like a beast... It also help reduce the delay of the throttle, I noticed it was more responsive. The looks is also nice especially with the included heat shield you'll able to install your stock air induction tube to it.<br /><br />Pros: Easy setup, Guaranteed HP, Better Mileage, Better Throttle Response, Can be maintained with K&N Cleaning Kit.<br />Cons: None at all<br />Overall: Best bang for buck (Short Ram Intake Kit)
B00030BFQU|5|I bought this battery charger mainly to take  with me on camping and RV trips. I have A 6.0 Ltr. diesel that I use as a towing vehicle. and I thought with this 300 amp boost I could jump start my pickup if ever I needed to. And yes while out on a trip, my pickup wouldn't stat one very cold morning. ( Low Batteries )I hooked up the charger to my batteries,pluged into the campground current, put it on boost and she started right up. I keep it in my RV now.
B002P8R3E6|3|These are ok.  The mirror surface isn't perfect.  These were pretty inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for.
B000IYA3KK|1|The description is incomplete as it should read &#34;steel control arm cars only&#34;.  For 93-95 I have never seen a steel control arm 940 although I do know they exist in theory.  The annoying part is they are charging me for the return when it reall was an incomplete description issue.  I would never have known had I not checked out a &#34;real&#34; import automotive site that sold both the aluminum control arm style and the one in this listing.
B005FL6RTC|5|The r so good product
B00KHX6WMU|4|It worked and saved me a lot of money. I received my order very quickly. I had only used standard shipping.  I didn't receive any instructions included. But before purchasing I had Google the information and was able to find a video on YouTube of how to program the alarm.
B0061TU2JS|5|Slid right in and worked perfectly in my wife's 2010 Honda Odyssey
B0009PSAWQ|2|fast shipping but low quality
B000GZLUGM|5|Very happy and looks great on my 06 1200C.
B00317BCZQ|5|Went with the 220main jet and58 slow het,it's a new bike ,runs like a raped ape and I got better gas mileage.<br />Only complaint is the carb screws are too short.<br />Other than that we'll worth the money!
B00H15WSBQ|1|not as bright as the sdx ones and not the right color
B003O36H3Y|5|The Subaru like it too
B002UKYKIG|5|as expected - arrived very quickly.
B00280CTEA|5|At this time they look and work great. Will find out down the road how they hold up. a good buy.
B000HAUVNO|3|It does what it designed to do, but the threaded section does not hold up for very long. I'm already on my second set.
B002NM28MQ|1|This product does not stick well. Driver handle keeps coming off. Would not recommend to anyone. I regret putting them on.
B00V5I7DPQ|1|Was looking forward to putting this on my brand new motorcycle, unfortunately the spider decal was not centered on the frame, piece of crap workmanship, I guess they can't afford a quality control person to check these before they ship. For the price you would think it would be better.
B000FW61SI|2|The plastic is somewhat distorted.
B00C5J1K3A|5|fits perfectly. well built.looks amazing.the improvement to the daytime appearance is priceless, the only thing that surprised me was that the lights aren't brighter being that they are leds however they are still just as bright as stock.
B001684X76|5|Works very well..It has a red battery charging indicator light that goes off when the battery is charged and &#34;floating&#34; (maintaining)..Also the cord is pretty long which makes it more convenient to use...
B002O1N9Z6|5|fits just like oem part plugged right in cant tell from original definite recommend hopefully will last as long as original without clouding or yellowing so far many automatic washes andall is fine
B006LO6RD8|5|1. The unit worked until the first power glitch (Back UPS ES550) then I got a replace battery alarm. I have tried the battery in 3 different ES550 units, same failure. I am returning for replacement and will updte this when that occurs.<br /><br />2. Update-8.16.12- contacted the seller (email) who responded very quickly and said to dispose of the defective unit and they sent a replacement priority mail same day. The new battery works fine. I have simulated a power fail and it worked with no glitches and recharged as expected.<br /><br />3. This company is very responsive in their communications. I think the bad unit was a fluke and plan to order another for a backup unit I have. The extra amphour is a plus.
B008HTQLVI|5|If you own a older jaguar you will have found out that HSMO is a  necessity for many of the cars systems to operate properly you will have found out that it can be difficult to obtain unless you live near a jaguar dealership and then pay that price amazon offers the quality of an international known brand at an affordable price shipped quickly and with tracking the product was easy to install and has worked admirably restoring lost performance to a wonderful vehicle I am restoring I highly recommend it I'm buying two more for stock
B000BDAXVM|1|I ordered rear mats for my CRV and they shipped mats for a Ford Excursion or a F-150 pickup.  I shipped them back immediately and so far I haven't heard a thing from that company.  I don't know if I made the mistake or they did.  I am still waiting for my credit card to be reimbursed.
B0006301LO|5|I used the stainless steel braiding to build a mash tun for homebrew, and it works out perfect. It will increase your efficiency and help with mash flow. Highly recommend for DIY Mash Tun construction.
B007RNZH2E|5|Good OEM replacement as an alternative to dealer stock. Be informed to verify that these pads are the correct ones for your car as the 96-01 model year range vary in trim/ sub-model.
B000NNCOI0|1|2 big
B0069RNNPM|5|Not OEM, but did what it was supposed to do at a great price.
B002I2MEFC|5|nice extra
B004YNOT0Q|5|Because older jeep wranglers have limited storage space, this is fantastic for storage, and looks like a real \\"Jerry Can\\" .<br />:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br />update: I sprayed both my cans with A rattle can of clear coat (two coats), have not noticed any discolor/fading yet. I live in the bright sun of the Four Corners NM.  I also have the open can which I put a over the shoulder can cooler inside, works fantastic for the barley pop and soda and water. Found a igloo bag that fits well inside, no leaks.  Put a \\"Gasoline Only\\" sticker on them just to be funny.
B00B3TAHHS|3|No memory. Every time you turn it on, it defaults back to 1st light pattern.
B00B2YE4B4|3|The color is a very clean 5,000k (pure white) which is what I was after.  However, as others have stated, this bulb in the dome light stays lit very dimly when the car is on.  Even when all of the lights are off inside the car, this bulb remains on (but very dim).  I'm not sure if this is due to the bulb, or the car, or the combo of this bulb in that specific car... but no other LED bulb in any of my other cars remains on like that.
B00DNJQ3LK|2|This thing was about five or six feet long (ordered the lg.) and it's nice and thick though but not for a scooter.<br />My goodness. You can't really see but it's textured. I guess it would be great for someone with a big motorcycle.
B0009IR056|5|For the price I could not beat it! Same price as another one but much better filter! Easy to install!
B0038EOS9Y|5|Quality product, looks great and arrived ahead of schedule. Recommended to family and friends. Reflective and looks awesome on a black vehicle.
B003R8F6A6|5|This product came exactly as its described and in a timely manner, all the way to Germany. It fits perfectly into my car and I love that the back seat part goes all the way across instead of two separate pieces.
B004P23VQO|5|Great top. Looks great. Doesn't leak. Installation takes a while. Good videos online though that help.
B001P2X4FK|4|The rack came quickly.  I haven't installed it yet but it looks like it will do exactly what it claims to do.
B000WHACHC|5|JUST WHAT I WANTED...HOLDS STUFF, LOCKS IF NEEDED, NO TIPPY DRINKS..AND SKINNY ENOUGH TO FIT INTO MY TIGHTER FRONT SEATS....THANKS
B005DHC9J0|5|Looks good instaled and easy to take off.  securely anchors bike and takes up little space in the car when it is removed
B0046I3I8I|3|I took a chance on these and they are so-so.  I am worried they might &#34;blow off&#34; if the wind was strong as they just fit (15&#34; wheels) so maybe after they are on a little they might fit better.  No way to insure they will stay on so will have to weight and see. $500 plus tires need to be protected from SUN.
B00G9HYXEM|5|Pleased
B004UTCISE|2|Rusted within 2 weeks of being on my car. Looked great initially but then rusted so badly it looks terrible. Not worth the money.
B004I15MH8|5|We recently hit a goat, long story short, the headlight was the only thing that got busted.  We were quoted over $300 for a replacement at a dealer in town.  I got this, one two day shipped for less than $90.  It looks and feels (weight and quality wise) as great as the original.  Installed in about fifteen minutes, saved 233% on an \\"original\\" replacement.
B00A0IXL9E|5|great for produce
B00EFH0ONW|5|The plate fits well on my 2001 Toyota Corolla. I do not regret buying this design.
B0049ZNFKY|2|I can't imagine for the life of me why I would receive 2 O-Rings instead of 4. I mean... 4 Injectors, 4 O-Rings? Did I miss something? Maybe I should've given you half the money, or order half as much merch from Amazon. I guess I'll have to wait to finish my daily driver. Who needs a car for Winter in Colorado, Right? At least the quality is everything I expected.
B007HV2OXQ|5|Bought these for me and my boyfriend because we are huge fans of FLCL, and they were worth it! Though it's kinda tricky getting the *real* sticker on because what you peal off *might* have a 'square' sticker attached to the real circular sticker. I made that mistake haha, but all-in-all it's totally rad :)
B003IS3HV0|4|I read the other reviews and followed their advice when applying on my vintage finish leather sofa. I applied with a soft microfiber cloth and massaged into the leather easily. I have dogs and cats and it definitely improves the look and feel. The color deepens and the scratches reduce, but still maintains the leather vintage finish.
B0058FETMM|5|excellent
B00FFGQTI6|5|Good!
B008CRY5EA|5|Dog diarrhea'd over it 2 days after I got it! Wiped right off, and with some lysol, looks brand new.<br />Best product for pet owners.  Holds up to scratches, and scuffs as well.
B00BITR104|5|Worked perfect!
B0010T6SC4|5|Just like &#34;factory&#34; !
B005OUWZLI|5|I live in New Jersey, and it's illegal for me to pump my own gas. So I found this gas station were chicks actually pump gas for you! And wow! Do they LOVE my new gas cap. Get one...for the ladies!
B000WJWWQY|3|I ordered this piece from this vendor and a rear fender from another (both acerbis, white), and the rear fender showed up in a nice frosty white color, but this front fender has a slightly greenish case. I hope it's not noticeable when they're both on the bike, but I wish they matched!
B00CMVWML0|4|Good quality product with fast shipping. Have not install on scoob yet,cause it's in garage getting  a new paint job. Will give a update after installation.
B006G3SS8Q|5|Right part, good price and decent shipping time. Thanks
B005M9DQYQ|1|These things look great and are easy to install, so I was pretty stoked when I got them. But after only 3 riding sessions, the rear lenses had completely melted from the bulbs running too hot. DO NOT BUY!
B0049D13GE|5|exceptional pacaging and qualit
B0034ZUZM6|5|Great product, does a great job pulling our friends out of the mud ;-) A must have if you do a lot of mudding!
B00CPO8KIS|5|BOOBS what else can you say LOVE THEM!!
B004GCC6IW|5|recieved product very quickly, was packaged to protect the product and included the mounting hardware what more could I ask for.  once again why purchase a junkyard part that is more expensive!
B000EVU89I|5|Works really good. I have a 1974 honda cb200 we are rebuilding and were unsure of the cylinder/ring condition. We did both a dry and a wet test on both cylinders and got consistent results. The kit comes with a few adapters for different sizes. Very usefull tool to have in your tool chest.
B000A4BYQA|5|We were so glad to find this user's guide for our old but showroom LaBaron convertible. It was everything promised in quality and arrived quickly.
B005983V5O|1|First It took forever for it to get shipped and delivered, Second not worth the money 260 something for this trash I could have printed some papers myself with my printer and glued them onto my bike if that's what I wanted. I think that for it not to have any reviews they should have worked a little bit harder to get the best first review so others would buy it. But im not satisfied with this product is not as thick as they make it seem and is so hard to put on your bike, I just hope It doesn't fall off within a week or two, but I should have spent my money on a paint job or better plastics, so If anyone is interested in buying this trash DON'T, is not worth your money or time, Try to get more plastics or a paint job this isn't worth it.
B00F8GREMS|5|Recieved it way before it was supposed to get here. Love it.
B000701HF0|4|A must for your RV water heater that requires and Anode Rod.  You should remove it at least once a year to be sure there is enough surface on the Anode Rod.  Will save replacing the the whole water heater if you fail to do this. A little difficult to remove and reinstall, but again worth the time and effort.
B000BWEHC4|5|Represent the Thizz Nation with this fresh sticker. I got one for my car, get one for yours or get it as a stocking stuffer along with some Thizzle Pizzles for your homies. It's cheap too!<br />THIZZ OR DIE.<br />FREE MAC MINISTER!<br />R.I.P. Mac Dre.
B00JBJ6KQY|5|Perfect fit.
B000RNW5HQ|5|Hitch installation on 2006 Honda Odyssey:<br /><br />The instructions that came with this hitch said that you would have to remove the exhaust but I found that a simple rope tied to the muffler and a little bit of tension toward the driver's side moved it enough to install this with ease.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DRILL OR REMOVE THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  Once I torqued each bolt to 68 lbs., the job was done.  It took 10 minutes.  [...]  Best price, perfect fit, easy to install.<br /><br />Happy towing!
B00335JQ8Q|5|good price, good looking, good fit.
B005HMJIIQ|3|Works on 2015 WRX but i wish it was brighter
B000E2CUWU|1|Garbage and a total waste of money. The idea is great but it doesn't look right of fit right, kid of sits there like a weird garter belt.
B008HR6JOO|5|My son and my husband both have Ford trucks and were always getting their keys mixed up. When one of the key Fobs for my son's car broke, we found these on Amazon! They sent VERY easy directions to program the remote and it works beautifully! The last time I replaced one  at the locksmith it cost over $100 for them to replace it and &#34;program it &#34;! Would definitely recommend!
B000ALDRPE|5|The product itself is fine.   The site specifies that you should \\"be sure to order two\\", which is what I did. You would never believe the mess. I order two. I get one. I contact Amazon. Replacement gets lost in UPS Hades. I check UPS; to be delivered. I check UPS; still to be delivered. I contact UPS again; STILL to be delivered. I contact Amazon same day. Order was canceled!? Says UPS said I was not at home. (I was.) I have to RE-order. Price has gone up!  I can evaluate things all day. NOTHING changes.
B004IAREUC|5|Gives my truck more horsepower. You can tell when you hit the accelerator. Very happy with my purchase.
B003IHMHLW|5|Well worth the money and shipped fast
B00PKK3KZW|3|My reviews: FYI - I never give the highest score under the pretext that there is ALWAYS room for improvement.<br />Main use: Toyoyo Yaris<br />Product works well with one exception, can blow off in high wind.  Could do with bigger/stronger magnets.<br />However, the manufacturer did put flaps on the upper sides that enables one to close them into the doors to keep, at least the top portion in place and keep the shield from flying away.  The bottom portion has blown off and flapped/folded up exposing some of the bottom windshield in a high wind night. Regardless, it still beats scraping ice all the time. Also, could be a little bigger.  Would be nice of have a bout 3-4 more inches top to bottom to insure wiper well coverage.
B00N3446NC|2|Got these back in May haven't had but three months and one of them is already tore up. It wouldn't quiet attach very securely to begin with to our existing side rails and now it won't attach at all.
B00CKD3D22|5|Great stuff. Highly recommended.
B007REFW32|5|Product came well-protected in yellow padded envelope. Easy to apply and get air bubbles out, but make sure you apply on exactly the right spot! Be careful of scraping the edges. I would recommend some kind of clear case for your Mac so the sticker doesn't get damaged...or just be really careful. I get tons of complements for this! So worth it.
B0021JF92C|4|Good Product
B004QHJFAO|4|Satisfied.
B000GZJ0GO|1|If there was less than one star, that is what I would put. I'm warning you: Do Not By This Product, Let Alone From OHS Powersports. The picture is a joke... there is no way this jacket fits that lady. My girlfriend is 5 foot 4, about 120 pounds, so we got her the small for Christmas. The length fits her, but unless you are a square, the width is going to be WAY too big. It is not slim fitting at all, and the belt does absolutely nothing. The jacket color is even lighter than what this picture shows, so i'm sure they even used a different jacket in the picture!   So after talking with them, they told me I could return it, just to pay shipping. About a week later I receive an email telling me I'm getting a refund, but it wasn't what I paid for! I emailed them again, and all they said was \\"all returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee.\\" What do they have to do, hang it up? They didn't even tell me they were going to charge me more if I returned it!  I am completely disappointed with this company, and with the jacket. I will NEVER buy from OHS Powersports again. This experience has just been unbelievably angering. Merry Christmas.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Keeps my Honda Fit cool. Fits windshield, folds small and lightweight.  Update: after a couple months of use I'm still enjoying the qualities of this shade.
B00CDVXWBS|1|I ordered this three times all the times one bag was missing! I never got a full set! Plus they r cheap and hold nothing... Amazon let me keep the last one but what good is that it's only one cheap bag!
B0026146DI|5|Exactly what I wanted. speedy delivery and has been on my car for a long time and is not peeling or cracking. No discoloration from the sun and I live in Az!!
B000A7BMKK|5|Very Happy
B000WGYNAA|4|For a car-based camping trip, I needed a larger capacity inverter to handle a 375W air pump and larger hand vac, among other things, and anything with a 15 amp fuse (cigarette lighter socket) just wasn't going to cut it.  Knowing that the motors with my equipment have a initial power spike, I wanted something that was rated over 500W continuous power.<br /><br />I bought this unit at discount without the supplied clip-on cables, which worked for me, because I had no intention of using the connectors, which appear to have 12-14 gauge wire at best.  I spent an addional $10 to get 4 ga. cables with battery terminals from an auto store, as I was hooking up this unit to a spare battery and not the one in the car.  The unit works as advertised, and didn't run into any problems with the inverter cutting out.<br /><br />The only issue is that the cooling fan kicks in even when powering something small such as a small (15W) lamp, and the fan noise is noticeable.  This was ok for my purposes, but may be an annoyance for others.  I was happy to get something with relatively high capacity without breaking the bank.<br /><br />I couldn't rate the unit with the supplied clip-on cables (for use out of the car) and whether they would work out as well for higher wattage applications.  For that reason, as well as the fan noise, I gave it only 4 stars rather than 5.
B00MTZ9FKU|5|I LOVE this patch.
B0034ZYE5U|5|Great winch. This replaced a Chinese winch on a jib crane. The build quality is top notch and out performs the larger winch it replaced. Lifted 3000 lb gang boxes without breaking a swet.
B001FZNDXA|5|I brought this a week after I got my new car. Its almost 6 months ago, and this Cover still looks new, minus the road dust. The letter are still all holding its colors. The only issue I had with it is that its not a snug fit, so it may make some noise once in a blue moon.  The plastic part feel somewhat cheap. When I first got it in the mail, i thought it would not last me a month. I live in MA, and we have lots of pot holes, and going over each bump makes me think it will break the cheap plastic. But its still on my car. The cover part feels heavier, and the chrome has not discolor at all.
B009NVO31Y|5|Came quickly and in adequate packaging.  Like all antennas the increase in performance is not much but depends on use.  For me to increase strength on an average network, it did not show much.  But it is what I bought.
B00EKN2P60|5|See my review for GRV Ba15d 1076 1142 1176 LED bulb 126*3014 SMD AC/DC 11-28V 4W High Bright Warm White Pack of 2<br />Lots of lumens for very little battery power!  I  also bought 6 of these bulbs but the different socket makes it easier if they do not light up at first.  Just remove and rotate 180 degrees so the connections have the proper DC polarity.<br />Prior Review<br />__________________________________<br />Here is my first opportunity:<br /><br />I have an older motorhome that I had already changed out many lights and installed fluorescent fixtures several years ago that cost over $50 each plus a lot of installation work. However, I decided to order the 10 pack of LED's and try them in other locations. After popping off the plastic cover and removing the standard incandescent (IC) bulb, the LED did not work. I tried another, then another, then another - same result. The IC bulb still worked. I am pretty good at electrical issues, I can wire an entire house, but I am confused.<br /><br />Eventually, I tried another socket in another part of the motorhome. All worked fine. Every bulb I had tried, worked. Then I went back to original socket to check voltage. It was OK but then I noticed it was a negative 12 V DC. LED's have a POLARITY Requirement. 5 out of 7 of my fixtures were wired properly with the central terminal positive. 2 fixtures were wired with the central terminal negative! I changed the wiring and all worked fine. Lots of warm lumens (light output) and low battery drain when I use these bulbs.<br /><br />The second opportunity is to have light in more places without draining the battery. I have ordered more and now I know what to watch for in my RV.<br /><br />One other opportunity is to have battery power left at the end of a 5 day camping trip. Another opportunity is to have your batteries last longer. The deeper you discharge an RV battery, the shorter its life is. So, change out the old IC heaters (yes the extra power used by IC bulbs is just converted to heat), get more light, and help your batteries provide longer service life.<br /><br />As far as one reviewer saying they are easily broken. I have now installed 12 and none have presented any breakage problem. They are shipped directly from China and do take a few days longer than Amazon prime but it is worth the wait.<br /><br />I recommend using these LEDs if you want good light in your RV.converted to heat), get more light, and help your batteries provide longer service life.<br /><br />As far as one reviewer saying they are easily broken.

B004LX3AS6|5|Considering this is the smallest battery charger I have ever seen, it really does pack full size power.  I have been using it on my lawnmower battery and also on the battery for my 57 Chevy.  The Chevy sometimes sits for a while and I get some battery draining issues.  I can leave this connected to maintain a full charge at all times on that battery.  Great product, great small size.
B007HRON9I|5|Fits perfect and was easy to install.  All the shims that are sent with it.....you actually need them.
B00IMPEWHM|5|Did the trick, went back ordered extra set
B005JPNXC8|5|Looks even better in person, i will get a few more for some friends, they like it too!I recommend this
B00802F2US|4|These were the top item on my son's wish list.  He was so happy to get them!!  Haven't installed them yet, but have heard a lot of good things about them.....
B001UC3BQW|5|Fit and Work perfect for my Cadillac Escalade 2004 y have no more leaking oil problems thanks to Dorman Diffferential Cover..
B001KS8706|4|Good value, know that this replacement is about half as thick as the manufactures mirror. For the price it is a sold value.
B0065V5VKW|1|Works great
B00G0KRHK0|3|over priced
B00BFLVUDO|1|battery will not hold a charge 24hrs I had my scooter checked and they said it was the battery....
B00063ZMJA|5|Good item
B004ZF3Y40|5|Outstanding!!!!!! I have ordered other HID kits from Amazon and none have come with the harnesses like this one. Easy install and bright as can be. I also receive emails from the company's website checking in to make sure all is good. Highly recommend and would buy again and again.
B000760FWU|5|These jacks were a gift to a daughter us use on here trailer.  they are most useful when she needs to have a level trailer to make it more comfortable
B008LQSPKW|5|Fits 77 Honda CB400 perfect, better quality than expected, pre-oiled and looks great very pleased, excellent price.
B00WH1ZC80|4|I think it will work fine.
B000C0UMNI|5|Fit my 2008 mercury mountaineer without any issues. It arrived fast and was as described. Fit on the engine (V6) all good.
B000CDAEAQ|5|Gone through a full winter, a number of spring rains already ( April showers in the Midwest has been horrible this year), driving in Chicago traffic and on deserted interstates. These are by far the finest quality wiper blades I have ever installed and used. Both my vehicles have a lot of miles on them and I've used the cheaper Anco, Trico, Bosch and few other brands. Forget them all and invest in the Valeo's.
B000CO96FE|5|Good service and price thanks
B004A30UHG|4|works great
B0013G0J5Q|5|Correct part for the front of a 2006 Trailblazer LT
B0009OMYH4|4|To get a better compression tester of this type, you would have to spend hundreds. This will work in most small shops and if handled carefully, should last for yrs. I don't know how you would test one of these...short of using a compressor, but then you're relying on the compressor gauge etc.
B00VR6ZXR6|5|It's a license plate frame.
B001R1Q62W|1|Horrible, they do not fit correctly. There is a HUGE gap between the fenders and the actual headlight harness on my 2002 GT. They were scuffed from the top and the xenon bulbs were not included.
B000VT2JS6|2|My window would not close with this item. There was no double sided sticky tape on the ends to adhere to.
B002ZTNWYK|5|These all-weather floor mats fit my new Cube perfectly, and the high rims do a great job of catching all the muck and snow that would just soak into a carpet.  They are not cheap, but this is a good price and they will keep your front footwells pristine.
B000QDOEV2|2|These are not what I was hoping for when I bought them.  They don't fit like I would like and they are very flexible and thin.  I didn't install them.  I image they'd be ok in some installations but not what I wanted.
B0046EIZRG|2|Not best quality, holding features are weak and easily bent/broken during install resulting in lose not usable product. Buy OEM product if you want quality worth the extra $$.
B007DCH5SS|5|You might ask what kawaii is...in truth, it's this single decal, My laptop looks so hood with it on, girls will love you, I promise.
B0050VF9RS|5|This one was for a gift, but I own another that ran my refrigerator/freezer, and alternately my gas central heat during an extended outage. It made life without power much nicer.
B006V7TBBA|5|Great quality lights, very bright and super classy on the Jeep. Installation was very clean cut, instructions are simple and easy to read.
B00CXXI4XC|4|Hitch extender works fine.  There seems to be a lot of play in the outside sizing of the unit bit it works.
B0064D3RIY|5|Quality is amazing not a cheap product at all. Very high end I love Hello Kitty the black mats are a grown ups dream.
B00HRHWHNW|5|Works great!
B004UBCKYY|5|I have carried these on my key ring for over twenty years.  Through the Boy Scouts, US Army, a Girl Scout troop, two children and countless adventures, these tweezers have pulled from myself and many others countless splinters, thorns, ticks and even stitches. They remain strong, sharp, precise, retain their shape and best of all, securely fastened on my key ring. They are easily cleaned and sterilized and still function as they do when new. I have given away dozens of these as gifts over the years. The best tweezers are the ones you have with you when you need them. Absolutely the best.
B00IPQSVM0|4|Cool
B00APOMTXC|2|Switch didn't work properly other than that good product.
B001A6CR22|3|I purchased this pack  8 years ago the pros, quality construction, the bag is large enough for long trips, the dual bag system is good you can take the smaller barrel bag for short trips. It looks good on the bike once it is on. It will comfort to any back rest size. The extra d rings on the pack are in pretty good places to secure netting for extra storage. The Cons on this bag are the strap placements takes some practices figuring out how to secure it to your bike, needs a better fastener on straps. Needs better water protections, items will get wet in a down pour. Needs a stiff centered handle to make lifting easier. It has a nylon strap placed on the top/back this makes lifting awkward.<br />All in all if you only take an occasional long ride or just the extra space once in a while this is a great bag. But if your a serious biker who travels often. I would spend an extra $ 50.00 to get a better bag.
B00IEB2672|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B0096BAP0E|5|This was a perfect fit for my 1997 Del Sol automatic.  The plastic hose inlet/outlets don't look as durable as the factory brass fittings, but it has worked well so far.
B0002LBL3C|5|Excellent
B0076ATS96|5|Perfect fit
B0066R79HI|5|Although their cost is lower than other BMW parts, such as Lemförder and Meyle, I can assure you the quality is not. These control arms have been put through rigorous commutes on a 2000 BMW Z3, and are still like new. I replaced the bushings at the same time, and they are already worn out, yet the Üro control arms are still good.<br />Would recommend if you're into your wallet as much as you're into your car.<br />They won't let you down.
B00GI2I6UK|4|Made from plastic but very easy to install and looks great. Would buy again.
B0050NARPU|5|Beautiful product - Changed the feel of my truck overnight.  Easy to install as it's backed by poly instead of foam - so can bend and flex into position.
B00904WS8E|5|It is affordable and durable. I am 5,11 and a little more than average build and orderd 2 sizes up from my normal and it fits perfect the insulation liner is awesome for chilly days well worth the cost!!! If you are a budget rider like me this is a great jacket! If you don't have hundreds to spend but still want protection go with the tms jacket.
B000TXWJIO|1|This product may work on exhaust wrap, but it did not work for me on new metal as advertised.  I used three coats of this product on a pair of new block hugger headers and the exhaust pipes back to the mufflers that I glass beaded before painting, and let the paint dry for two weeks.  When I started the car, my garage filled with really toxic smoke from the exhaust, and the Thermo-Tec paint blistered onto the floor.  I DO NOT recommend this product.
B002DZGC52|5|Love my decal I am a tweety fan have been and always will be.  Have tweety all over my truck inside and out.
B004J70H26|5|AAA
B0041MTABS|5|worked perfectly and the a/c is blowing super cold now, very fast shipping , and, I am very glad I went this way
B000931OEO|5|The engine in my 99 Isuzu rodeo was knocking and would not really run.  My mechanic told me I needed a new engine.  I could not afford the outrageous pricing.  I purchased some Bar's Leaks engine repair @ a local Circle K.  Poured it in, within a hour the knocking was gone and the engine smoothed right out.  I told my mechanic about it, he uses it for all his customers that have blown engines now!!!!
B001GJ3FIS|5|Bought this several weeks ago and it still Works well. Which is more than I can say about other brands.
B000B8JUBQ|5|It works great and safety is good for high school kid.
B00GGQL76I|3|Need hardware
B00OAVMU30|5|Nice cover, quick shipping A+ for me, compliments my ruby red 5.0 nicely
B002N2HYF2|5|Quick easy transaction and the item was completely in tact.  I was going to have to pay $300 - $400 to fix my window...i was able to do it for less than $100 after finding this.  Thanx!
B00EYPGLH8|5|Excellent product - unparalleled grip, sturdiness, and style. Bolsters confidence and control in extreme degree bank angle turns, as well as acceleration and stopping. Nice chamfered edges and good cut profile for my Diavel Cromo.
B001FE0RN0|5|just what I needed.
B00755JMYS|5|These bulbs are excellent!  Very white light and it made my dash look great.  Just remember these are LED's and not bulbs, they will only work in one direction.  So, if you don't get any light, turn the bulb around and plug it in.  They will work and you will like the result.<br /><br />5/12/2014 - After having these in my dash for awhile, now the LED's have starting blinking for no apparent reason, making the instrument panel hard to read and distracting.  So, my opinion of these bulbs has changed.  I would not recommend them.
B001JKUPUA|5|Worked perfectly for the car.  Also, vendor is local, SJC, so arrived rather expeditiously.<br /><br />The other factor, ti really works to keep the car reasonably coo even on hot days, which seems to be all the rage these days.
B004ME11FS|5|Arrived on time and in good order; works perfect.
B003TMHRPC|3|It look great on my car but after 2 years.. the black stripes disappear. And since i hand wash my car, i know it is not from going to a car wash with high pressure hoses and harsh detergents.
B000BYELQY|5|From reading the various reviews, I figured that there was a good chance I'd be able to figure out how these would go on my car, but I was still worried because of the negative reviews.  Had the old push button blades off of my 2009 VW Jetta TDI in 20 seconds, and after looking at the installation video for my type of attachment (there's a QR code right on the Bosch box that takes you to the videos) the new ones were on in the next 30 seconds.  All you have to do is remove the outer piece of the attachment on the new blade and it slides in like a champ.  Seriously, that's all there was to it.<br />The VW forums have instructions on loosening the brackets and only replacing the rubber blade, but that's just crazy seeing as how easy this is as a one-for-one replacement.
B001XLG5FE|4|Looks cool highly recommend it for a Disney lover.. Keeps the car cool and protects the vehicle.. Good price as well!
B00OY5H1DQ|3|not as bright as I thought to be, bought them for my truck camper interior light bulbs upgrade but little disappointed. ordering the 48smd 13smd not bright enough.
B00068XCQU|5|I am using this device to trickle charge 2 scooters, a Honda & a Yamaha. The quick connectors (which I haven't installed yet) are great and will make make this process of switching from one scooter to another much easier. I highly recommend this charger.
B000NJSGVS|3|fair
B001DKJU8Y|5|This product is truly amazing. I bought a set of (semi) rare headlights for super cheap for my Ford Focus, and the only catch was they had definitely been used for the 12 years they were on the previous vehicle. To start, I used 400-600-1000-1500-2000-2500 grit wet sandpaper, to remove all of the oxidization. I worked pretty hard on them, probably 30 mins per headlight going through the different grits. I then made sure the headlights were clean, and started using this. the first few applications were a let down, but don;t let that fool you. I then laid down a pretty heavy coat of this stuff, rubbed it in really nice, and let it dry for atleast 30 mins. After that, I took a microfiber cloth (clean), and buffed these headlight back to BRAND NEW. well, not quite, but about 99% of the way there. some swirls were left from the sandpaper (but that's my fault for using such a low grit at first, I recommend starting no lower than 600). these headlight are beautiful now. I will continue to re-apply every so often, as per the instructions, to keep these lights looking new.
B00400XFQ2|5|I bought this to solve the problems of my harley spitting oil.  This product works well it keeps my bike clean looks great and the price was right.
B00BNIOH84|5|Fits perfect works a described stays out of the way.
B001OZL9XC|4|I hope it's a good synthetic,I mean I read that it's good stuff and my bike seems to run just as before.  Really how can you tell whether one motor oil is better than another unless the motor breaks?
B00PNKHW4E|5|Works great nice and bright
B00H8DFKS4|3|Came with a few extra bulbs, bulbs could be a little brighter.
B004TMP18G|5|This product was beyond my expectations. It seems to have taken thousands of miles off my engine. The throttle response is instantaneous.
B004UQIUKW|3|I'm not sure who's is right because they are about 1/2&#34; short of covering my valcro backer.
B00BITHE2O|5|Perfect fit
B00E5PYUXE|5|As an older person I get a sore neck/shoulder from the seat belt tension. This little devise allows me to take the pressure off but with just a little freedom so safety is not an issue. Great product!
B006M4U8T6|5|Love them no problems at all getting them into my 2013 rouge took less than 5 minutes and I found that my rear cup holders open just fine (that was an issue with some of the other reviews) love them and would order again
B00N4OQ210|1|This CK-100 Auto Key Programmer will not work for Honda/Acura.  It is show compatible in car list have Honda and Acura but you can not program the key.  You will get error message ECU not found mean it can not read your ECU.
B00MP7MXTM|5|This product worked wonders on my Audi. Front seat had major wear and discolor. This product made the seat look new. Seriously saved 250.00 in cost doing it myself vs. Mobile leather restoration. Will not disappoint!  I will also state without hesitation that ScratchWizard has responded to and addressed all issues I have had without question!! These guys and gals rock!!!!!!
B006WY8SVQ|3|The self sticking tape was worthless. Had to buy some from store. Besides that ok.
B005FKXRIC|5|It this breaks going work for my 07 dodge charger sxt?
B000BYELN2|2|Living in N East means that a good wiper helps through all seasons.<br />Unfortunately, the first heavy rain proved something to be desired.<br />One of blades was squeaking pretty bad and both plastic flaps where popping up. These are suppose to stay down to help keep blade securely attached to vehicle....but not at all.<br />I had to use electrical tape to hold flaps down while driving and when you have blades installed you can flex the plastic a bit where they are connected to vehicle.<br />Never going to make through Boston winter so returning.
B004SMGAJ6|5|Very nice product.
B00684TIVE|5|Easy programming instructions sent with the remotes. Would recommend this remote to anyone
B00PTR0JKA|5|Hi lift jacks are one of the best on the market, but the red white and blue patriot edition is over the top.  It looks great sitting a top the brush guard.
B008VS4DFQ|4|Looks identical to the OEM washer. Correctly torqued it should be easy to remove next time too.<br /><br />Beware which seller you choose as I only received one washer
B00K9ZZXYY|5|Love these higher step stool/seats! So many uses! These are perfect on the deck or for an RV as an extra chair table, a seat, a plant stand, and of course a step stool! I purchased one for my mother's caregiver so that she might 'sit' and not have to bend over... to help my mother with her socks and shoes. Lightweight and easy to fold up an store.
B00C0XCHKG|4|Great product for the price
B003177W32|1|They have this listed as working on the 04-06 R1 and it does not.<br />I contacted BAZZAZ and received a response stating that they have never made this product for the 04-06 R1.  I proved this to Amazon and to this seller that this was false advertisement. (They have since edited their web page to no longer verify the 04-06 R1) They sent me a return label and when they received the product back, told me they were not going to refund me because I had already opened it. The paperwork stating which vehicles this worked on was INSIDE the packaging. This was NOT defective, It was advertised falsely.<br /><br />I guess I should start selling motorcycles on here and sending bicycles. False Advertisements seems to be the way to do business.<br /><br />Looks like I am not the first person they scammed.
B001O1Y5Z0|2|nice piece, but no matter what I did to tighten it up it would still move.
B001TGQ300|3|On my truck the recommended pressure for the rear tires is 80 psi. Air at gas stations doesn't like getting me to that level - and since nobody has free air anymore these days where I live you could put $5 in for one tire and not hit 80. The machine just won't get you there.    So, I decided to purchase something that would. I purchased this. This doesn't do it either, at least, I've never had the patience to get that far. I spent 90 minutes on one tire and got to 74. I have no idea how they came up with the rating of \\"300 psi\\" that they advertise. The truth is I don't really worry about the tire pressure anymore as long as it's 60+, just because I don't have a good way to get it to Ford's recommended rating of 80. As long as I don't put too much weight over the rear axle it probably doesn't matter anyway.    The pressure gauge on mine is also wildly off. Useless, so I'll stop it and check with a pressure gauge every now and then.    The cover for the compartment that stores the power cord broke on mine as well.    All that said, this is still the compressor I use because unlike others I've tried since purchasing this one, this one hasn't broke. It does seem reliable if nothing else. For my car where I need 30.5 psi it's fast and works well.
B007QOJT2S|5|Huge Hello kittie fan ,seen this and thought it was a must have with the zombie apocalypse apoun us and all.......Great sticker very well made ,shipping was very fast and thought this product was well priced would recommend to anyone thinking of buying.
B00068XCQU|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He says it really works great and is thinking of getting another one.
B000CIKCG2|5|i got this for my 1985 toyota corolla, does exactly what it is meant to do, and gives a clear indication of my fuel pressure. i later plan on adding a adjustable fuel pressure regulator and i'm confident with actual pressure readings now!
B007TYLQPS|5|The company responded promptly to my questions about warranty. The light came by the projected shipping date and in good condition. Following the youtube instructions on replacing a Prius taillight, the assembly was easily installed. It's been in for six months now without a problem. It was less expensive than the others, and there is a slight lip on the side not present on the original light still on the other side.<br />Bonus: removing the old light gave me access to the inside of the bumper, and I was able to remove a dent there with a hairdryer and pressure.
B00LGYFVUI|1|Was really excited to get this after seeing the Lego movie. It arrived and looked good on the film, but once I applied it to the window I could see that the lines were really jagged and they were noticeable from several feet back. I notified the seller and never heard anything back.
B009CCIAOK|5|After review, I purchased and received in 4 days.<br /> Took 3 hrs to remove old and Install new with o rings and metal gaskets.<br />Pressing together was accomplished using an angled pry bar to seat into front housing after cleaning and installing new oring. Used a touch of \\"Form a gasket\\" to hold o rings in place.<br /> Awesome price too!!!<br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009CCIAOK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B00BN45ESU|5|This item is exactly as shown. Fast shipping. My boyfriend LOVED it. Would definitely recommend this seller.
B007XZK6UE|5|LOVE IT
B00G4KLNX8|5|Very nice
B00HM3OEIM|5|Lights arrived exactly as expected with amazon prime. Installed them that day and they look INCREDIBLE. Installation of the lights was a breeze. But putting in the LED relay was kind of a pain. I didn't quite have small enough hands or nimble fingers. They look amazing and definitely add allot of character to the car.
B006VB8JTQ|4|Works well, we'll see how long it lasts.<br />Requires a little but of elbow grease so be prepared.<br />Cannot be done in 5 minutes. Give yourself an hour or two.
B008V20DQ0|5|as sold
B00009PGNS|5|After reading a lot of reviews - good and bad - for this cooler, I ordered one. This one replaces a much smaller 9 can cooler (different brand). First of all, it is very quiet. Above road noise, the radio, and the cabin fan, I can't hear it at all. Koolatron may have gotten some bad fans - a lot of people complain about noise - this one is infinitely quieter than the smaller cooler. This cooler would benefit from a gasket for the lid (which I'll probably add). The only thing that is slightly off is the interior fan shroud - it does not fit well, and I'm not sure if I can straighten it or not. There is a bit of a gap all down the right side - which means that some of the air is not moving across the cold plate. I think our friends to the north could do a bit better. Other than that, this cooler is great. Plenty of room, and cooled down to 40 degrees in about 40 minutes - in the car. I'm going to try an inverter and 120 volt adapter to see if that's any better or different than the 12 volt plug in. Unlike the much smaller coolers, this one has an interior fan to distribute the cold air - which means you can't totally pack it full - the air needs to circulate. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00IZNZOYQ|4|good shipper great product
B009IF2LEQ|5|great kit
B00IZNZOYQ|4|It works perfectly on my 4 cylinder Highlander 20013.
B000I1P8BM|5|Loved it and it kept me from having to weld 2 together ha ha
B003R7BZR0|5|great
B000E5U3ZI|5|All ways a fine product.
B004BXKTBC|5|These blades slipped on the wiper arms very easily, and locked into place. Used these models to replace the older Michelin type which also worked well. Will defeinitely buy from this vendor again, quick shipping too.
B001H2RWMO|5|This jacket is amazing, and a pretty great price for a genuine leather jacket. I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly. Has just enough room to wear a hoodie or sweater underneath. I absolutely adore this jacket and feel like Ozzy Osbourne when I wear it, which is exactly what I was going for.
B002WM7KBG|5|very good quality ... i saw the other comments and i agree with the others that if you are over A in cups size get a x-large or a higher in size  ...i looked at other vests this is the best one i have seen price and craftsmanship but the pockets are kinda small in some areas but it works
B003VZLJFG|5|I just got done using the system and Im glad I took the time to do it. The kit comes with everything you need including the sealant which is important.....My lights look almost new again. This takes a little time and effort and I think if I hadn't rushed I would have gotten better results, Im happy overall...
B001OG68Q4|3|I have owned a couple of different brands of this type of battery charger, and neither really seemed to do a good job of keeping the batteries charged over the Winter, even though in both cases the solar panels had plenty of south-facing sun exposure. Not sure that I would bother with these again.
B000C41KHG|5|This unit fit perfectly into my 1983 Mustang. It replaced the factory pump the locked up tight unexpectedly. Installation only took about 15 minutes.
B004AIF8JQ|4|This was a replacement for a broken OEM part. It fit well and works as like it should. Time will tell how it holds up.
B000CON1OQ|5|these are great springs. beware that this is the price for only one spring, which i think is an error on the listing. Everywhere else this price is for a pair of front springs. I returned this item and purchased from jegs.com. Amazon customer service rocks! five stars for them.
B000EQ80RA|5|my jeep grand cherokee 2000 ride like new
B005C5D21C|5|100 % good
B009UPL7TO|4|Reasonable priced and worked! A/C heating element works perfect now. Would have given it 5 Stars but the ECO and T-Stat were not labeled. Had to rely on other feedback to make sure I had them in the right place.
B001C4SLA4|5|i own a 2009 honda civic sedan si and my engine is completely stock. Im not big into cars or anything but after reading the reviews on here it sounded like something im looking for, which was to make my car sound not stock. I LOVE IT. If you are looking for something inexpensive to add to your car to make is sound good, this is it!
B000C1F8TU|5|Great .
B008HZLRZW|5|The Bosch BC273 pads are very efficient and as the name states; silent(not quiet)  am very pleased with this product and will buy again.
B004QMYZZ4|5|Worked as it should
B00HSG2XHM|5|As always...CRAZY BRIGHT...but.... The lights have developed condensation inside the sealed lens. AS ALWAYS, kudos to Amazon for assisting In replacement!! I wanted a set of LED fogs & an LED lIght bar... But now leary.  **update :) I have attached pics of each headlight so you can see that I am Having the same issues to other customers with the condensation problem.  Thank You to AMAZON for handling the return of the old set for a new set...I even asked KC for a quote on a set of fog lights & a lite bar when I Emailed their customer svc about this issue... No response ( they just lost the order)....
B00ICV9NBG|5|Item as described- very good quality.
B004R35VSW|4|Great hitch for the price.  Solid!  Could have been packaged a little better .Arrived on time. Great Fit!  Would buy from again.
B001O2ZKQC|4|As advertised.  Works great.
B005H7D4KO|5|Hey it fits the pedal like a Ford part. I've no complaints.
9539751047|5|Nice bright colors  - Made in the USA!
B006XV9HZY|3|Better try to be patient on install very hard install with battery in on a 06 psd but take out battery  definitely  a difference  glad it's in good product
B005PU01RC|4|Does what it says. But could be better if you could drill angled holes. And I wish I could use it to drill needle axle holes.
B002QGVW3K|5|Received charged and ready to use.
B007IPJL8W|2|The V Strom is designed to use laminar flow under the windshield to reduce buffeting. This windshield has a curled down tip which blocks laminar air flow. I am 6 foot tall, and this windshield was taller, but the wind still hits the top of the helmet. With the lack of laminar flow the buffeting is more aggressive than the stock windshield. I had to remove my helmet on the first ride because it was shaking so bad. Also this screen is acrylic, and can shatter. I tested that personally!
B002OUIXC6|5|Just what we needed to eliminate hose clamps that require tools.  No leaks so far...great product I will buy again when I need more..
B00MLO3S52|1|Gave me tottally wrong size needles
B009DJQHXS|5|Thanks! Great deal on good product!
B000EBMLIY|4|The straps do not velcro on like the standard Jeep option. So, what ya need is a small torx  socket to remove the stock brace bar. Remove the brace bar and slide the end of the new strap into place. Then just pick your desired option based upon how far you want the door to open up. These straps also are much higher quality which will prove much more difficult to break.
B0094MO1OQ|5|LOOKS GREAT AND VERY BRIGHT. EASY TO PUT IN.AND MAKES THE CAR LOOK RICHER THEN BEFORE.THANKS TO IJDMTOY AUTO ACCESSORIES.
B003O387TQ|5|This is a very cool & colorful \\"flower power\\" type sticker, I love it so much I put on my new car. It looks awesome & goes really well with the blue car. I also bought a peace sign keychain that I really like. I will buy from the seller again in the future.
B00ISUNBPU|5|1. Under $100.00 shipped with all the mounts. 2. Water proof  3. Impact resistant<br /><br />I now own 3 of these. I also purchased extra chargers and batteries.  We ocean kayak and ride Trikkes, Bikes, Hike, etc and we like to record the events. Sometimes it is fun to just turn it on and leave it.  I also own Gopro's. I find myself going for the SJ4000 more often due to ease of use and the LCD that allows you to frame the shot.  The Gopro stays mounted and just runs.<br /><br />If you have half a brain and can build with legos, then you can figure these out. I have white, yellow, and pink and a friend has the blue one.  We can get great footage from multiple angles and then edit it into really nice videos.<br /><br />Scuba capable, so add one to your tank and see what happened behind you. We have them mounted to the kayaks, and also drag one behind on a custom rig in the ocean.  At$100, if they get lost, it is much less of a hassle than losing $400+ for a HD3+.<br /><br />Besides,  who takes their phone diving, skiing, kayaking and swimming?<br /><br />Get several,  buy the extra batteries and charger and record your fun.<br /><br />These things record really well at night also,  as we recently captured the 4th of July pyrotechnics with both sound and clarity.
B007RW333A|5|Works for me
B003SYYGTG|4|work well
B00HMC4Y5G|5|First one ripped apart at the seem trying to get it on, but they replaced it no problem! This time around I put it in the dryer for 5 mns on high , I had my bf put it on lol & it looks great!! Fits my HHR 07' perfectly . Thank you !!!
B00CYLHD94|5|As others had said the stench was really awful when you first remove if from the box & wrapping (almost make you puke), but I put it outside, it got rained on a few times, and is fine. This stroller operates extremely well. I have maneuvered it over edges of sidewalks, and back onto them, and even taken some tight turns, and rode over lawns with no issue. My dogs: a Jack Russell Terrier(Rocky), and Chihuahua/Mini Doberman Pincher mix(Jack-afraid of his own shadow), jumped right in after the treats I threw in, but did not want to stay in. As I rode Rocky would not sit down, and kept faltering side to side on Jack, and Jack would sporadically scratch at the screen door to get out. None of this effected the stroller, and after a few times they actually started to appreciate just being on the bike ride with me. Rocky wants to jump in and go now, Jack still not so sure he wants to be in there. I assume it will take time before he associates that being able to go with me means he has to go in the stroller and learn to like it. But for now since he is very timid and scared of things, I'd say he's doing well. I have left the stroller out for weeks now, and it handles the weather well. I had no problems getting it on or off my bike, the cotter pin makes it easy. It literally connects right on the side of the center of your wheel, and once connected, you leave on the connector piece and simply take on and off the arm connected to the stroller. I don't think I've ever purchased/owned something that really was as easy as it sounded to use. Don't let the smell scare you, that goes away pretty quick if you leave it outside. Finally, pulling it I thought was going to be a lot harder, and it really wasn't, and that was with the weight of the stroller and 30 pounds of dog.  Overall Outstanding product!!!
B00540IXJQ|4|The cargo net is very strong!.. I've tried it just for the back and for the trunk and it keeps pkgs tight.... Would love if there was one with sections in the net for the same year this Toyota net is compatable with
B000TQ6P40|5|Very good product. Pretty much required to do any work to the late model fords with the locking rad hoses. Well worth the purchase and 1/10th the price of the actual Ford part.
B000G72UOQ|3|I personally do not care for the sunshade.  It is extremely difficult and time consuming to close.  In fact, it was so difficult to close I ended up buying another brand - one that closes normally - and easily.  Also.. it would be helpful if they listed  the cars it fits.
B00OLVGIDC|5|If fit just fine and looks good to
B001KS6FPA|5|Bought this blade to replace the tattered rear wiper blade on my 2005 Subaru Outback (yep, it fits).<br /><br />The blade comes with easy to follow instructions on how to remove the old blade assembly and install the new one. So easy -- it's a snap (pun intended).<br /><br />As for clearing water off the rear window, it does a first-class job.<br /><br />Buy one for the rainy season -- you'll be satisfied.
B0033I2BBM|5|These plugs work great for me, not just better than normal plugs 10 times better, and increase performance. your car will drive to its fullest standard. I have not check the life of these plugs but I will say \\"lifetime\\" When i bought my Honda 7 years ago they came with a set of these plugs. After 7 years i bought new ones, my wife's car is a 1996 lancer, i placed my old plugs into it and they work better than new normal plugs.
B009V06MRU|4|well satisfied with the price. The fit was fine and easy to install. I hope the chrome stays on because this manufacturer is well know for chrome coming off. It's a crap shoot.
B004HYU71M|5|In my four decades of using gaskets in a variety of contexts, I think I've found the gasket of my dreams.  Is it pliable, yet seals tight? You're goddamn it does. But it's so much more.  Soooo much more.  Just buy it, you won't be sorry.  The many different ways that this gasket will make your life infinitely better can't be put into words here, or anywhere.  Buy ten and experience what perfection feels like.
B0006O2PBW|3|after reading all the good reviews here, I bought a package.  it has a delicate scent, not too manly, not obnoxious.<br />be sure to use it correctly and only open it a little bit at a time from the top of the package.<br />left it in one real stinky room for weeks, not much change using two in that room.  was gone for a week, and when I came back the room doesn't stink like it did before.<br />so many comes in a pack i can give them to friends to use where they like.
B003M5JVDM|1|I thought it was gonna be a good buy but they move around no matter how you hook them and squish up in the seats.  Not very durable at all. and they do not fit any of our cars like this picture.
B000KL1A3U|5|Perfect fit  !!!!!!
B0031I9ZJK|5|Works very well.  I was having issues with my TrailBlazer reporting extremely inaccurate temperatures during hot restarts.  This is tied to the HVAC system, so because it would think that it was -30 degrees even though it may be 100+ outside.  This would turn off the A/C even though it was extremely hot.  After driving 5+ minutes, it would slowly return to the correct temperature.  This replacement resolved it and my A/C is working as it should.  Fantastic price!
B0000AZ8JB|5|This thing works great!  Sticks super well to our boat window too!
B007Q10HAO|5|Oil was delivered quickly, and much cheaper than the dealer.  If you have a groaning sound coming from the rear end when you make a turn, change the fluid and it will solve the noise.  Don't use knock off oil, for this oil has the additive to properly lube the differential. Seller did an excellent job of getting item shipped out quickly. Will use again.
B000BM8RT8|3|I bought this compressor to keep the tires inflated properly on my motorhome. The air hose and electrical cord are not long enough to reach all the tires from the battery compartment. The hose connection is not a standard air hose connection so I can't just add a longer hose. Very disappointed.
B00BKTJ8XK|5|I used this kit to fix the seat track on my 2007 Nissan Murano, and it worked great. I had to force the gear on the shaft because it is a press fit, but it worked great and fixed my seat problem.
B000RYANSI|5|Nothing says: Anti-small business, anti-fair trade, underpaid workers, and over roasted coffee beans - like a fresh cup of Starbucks. I have a bumper sticker that says precisely that, ordered on makestickers.com. But this bumper stickers &#34;Friends dont let friends drink Starbucks&#34; is classic! You can't refute that, pro-monopoly is anti-small business. You can't refute that less than 8% of their entire product line is fair trade, the other 92%, not so much. I haven't been inside a Starbucks in years but when I did, they had their fair trade prominently placed in the front, deceitful, honestly. Watch the movie Black Gold (2006) and get informed: http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Black-Gold/70054726
B0051SUMBI|5|After reading many reviews on this product, the majority being positive, I decided to purchase.  I'm completely satisfied with my choice.  The look is great and clean, the price was a plus, and shipping was fast.  I read of the issues with the vague installation instructions, but with a little common knowledge of your vehicle, it was a breeze.  I was done in less than twenty minutes.  Given the plastic steps, these side bars give my JK a more aggressive look while providing the functionality needed to enter/exit with ease.  I've received nothing but compliments from onlookers.
B0063U45K2|5|Great fit no problems
B00O0I7XDA|1|This color doesn't match AT ALL, and now every piece of my interior trim is painted a non-matching color on my brand new jeep.  I could have found a closer match with a random spray paint at the auto parts store.  But this said &#34;exact match&#34;...and shipping was ridiculous!  $10?!  For slow shipping?
B006CSP77K|5|Keyless remote has a slight texture that feels good in your hand and lets you know it's never been used.  Comes with a battery and EASY to follow instructions on a separate company's website. Buttons are firm and better than a new one from the dealership.
B009D41NMS|2|I wanted caps that would protect the threads on my valve stems just like OEM caps.  These only protect about half the threads.
B0045JD5Q8|3|pros:  easy to install, hold a lot of weight, and well priced.<br /><br />cons:  loud, the ends rust under the caps, and the key/lock is pretty cheaply made.<br /><br />i would recommend them.  you will get used to the noise, and won't give you any trouble when you take them off and on.  make sure to rub a little oil on the insides of the pipe toward the ends to prevent rust.
B00CEXKBS2|1|Fronts are good. Rear windows are not - they bend inward in the middle. I opened the rear window today and when I tried to close it the window hit the Ventshade and stopped 1&#34; short of closing. Had to exit the truck and hold the plastic out in order to close the window.
B000S34NG6|5|I was quoted $199 for this part from a local dealer, but found it here for $78. Placed the order around 4:00 PM, signed up for free prime trial. Upgraded to overnight shipping for $3.99 and had the part the next day. Had my mechanic install and has been working great ever since. Not much else to say other then I am 100% satisfied with Amazon and the vendors that they use.
B003U2MWC4|5|Strong and sturdy. You got to get this for your chrome grille.
B001J8M8HA|5|Fit perfectly and collects dirt and debris in the channels. A must to keep your floor boards new.
B008LZLT0G|2|The system &#34;sees&#34; objects directly behind the vehicle. When the vehicle gets within 3' of an object the tone gets louder and solid. This is a problem because I can judge 3' but really need more help as the distance gets closer. It does not sense the edges of the bumper which are the hardest to judge. Nothing like any factory installed system I ever used. Maybe you will have better luck.
B00391FOSK|5|My AC/heat was only blowing at my feet. Replaced the bad one<br />Works great!!!<br />Very easy to do.<br />Don't go to the dealer I saved myself $800!!!!
B000BWALQA|5|Works great ....easy too install
B000CPAMLA|5|Fits fine with no leaks.
B006ZOV91Y|5|Best rain suit I've ever bought
B007A3WA9E|1|Did NOT fit the John Deere GT235.
B00HMZFHI6|5|JUST ADDS TO MY SUPPLY OF METRIC FASTENERS, NICE ASSORTMENT
B0015UG9D6|5|This was a perfect fit for my 13hp honda generator,once installed,the engine fired right off,less that half the price of an OE replacement.
B003RA6MDE|5|I purchased the wrong one - needed the smaller one for my car.  they accepted the return and made it easy.
B000NZSU7C|1|didnt fit my truck,had to send it back
B00FYNRATM|5|At most other retailers, whether online or local, similar items will cost you 3 to 4 times more money.  This product is attractive, sturdy and well made.  Highly recommend for any G8 owner that is looking to replace your worn out key fob.
B00G3TYO9A|5|exactly what I wanted.
B002RVJX1C|5|Awesome test kit does it all, Best buy this year!
B00MJLHWXG|5|As described
B001INMKP6|5|Love this! My 6 year old son takes karate and I thought this would be so cute on my car. Easy to apply, looks great.
B000C5YD42|5|so far no problems at all.check engine lights went off. installed about a month ago. changed the one in the front.ease installation. price very good compare to toyota original parts. so far worth buying.hope it will last for a long time.
B000HS6OB4|5|A little too tight, but it works.
B009UKUUWE|4|Agift for my husband who ws very pleased with the product.
B002HARG2G|5|Worked perfect.  P2138 is fixed for good with this part, they seem to go about 100k miles.  Easy install with 10mm socket, took me less than 30 min.
B00C3UKEEM|3|Instructions in Chinese.  Seems to work good once you download the english version. Packaging was torn and worn.
B00JPJYCII|5|Item was correct as stated --- Shipping was on time! Great Job!
B000WKHFX8|2|Not worth the money.  It muffled the sound a bit, but not enough to justify.
B00DMTTSIQ|5|Great fit looks awesome
B0002Q7ZJ6|5|I never believe it when someone says 10 minute install... But this really was that easy! 01 grand Cherokee Laredo, one sided - plug and play install. Easier than on my wrangler!
B0007LDXLA|5|Just bought the sno brum and love it.  We just had 17.5 inches of snow in Wisconsin and it worked great.  This is the only product I could find to remove snow from a vehicle.  I would admit you can't use a lot of force when you using it otherwise it could break. Great product.
B000BZX92K|3|I recently purchased this for a vintage car as well,  However I wanted a different configueration other than the filter that close to the pump.  I was trying to remove the permanet clamps that the pump is shipped with and while twisting the head on the clamp... the hose end broke off.  I didnt feel that I was overpowering it and am very dissapointed in myself for not being more careful  but in Carter for shipping it with permanet clamps knowing that sooner or later you will have to take them off.  I would also perfer that the hose ends were screw in and not molded into the end piece.  BE VERY carefull if you are trying to remove the clamps... hope this helps prevent someone elses misery.
B006ID3RV2|5|Hah. I'm actually using these to hold onto my turn signals right now. Works great and it look pretty good too.
B004A6NB6A|5|Very pleased with price and quality
B00CMUD8E6|5|Prompt customer service. Quality product.
B003ZUNAVS|5|great lift kit easy install every part needed called prior to order company could not be more helpful gave require lift plus on f-150 yr 2012
B004MDSQ6Q|5|These are terrific small gifts or stocking stuffers.  Both of my daughters think they are cool and useful, as well.
B003NU0EM8|1|Not only did it NOT solve the problem, it also broke almost immediately. The rubber suction cup pulled right off the handle the first time I used it. Not only did it solve the problem, it also broke almost immediately.  Absolutely terrible product.
B004W98YAI|5|i put this on my back window in florida, which can be rough on stickers, its been up for about 3 months and its still holding great, the color hasn't started to fade either.
B008UOLOB2|5|Awesome product. Just a note that the cloth is located in the base of the pen.
B001OMLE4E|5|Good
B001DAJSG8|5|If you are the mechanical type and like doing the work on your vehicle yourself, then the Monroe complete strut assembly is for you. It doesn't get any easier than this product. Just remove your old strut and replace it with this complete assembly, job done.
B0009F9UZM|5|Quite simple to install and works well. It nice long wires for the connection. I recommend this buyer.  Thank You
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Brighter than stock bulb, super white. . Used as reverse light,  plug n play no problem.
B0029EXC82|4|I like the very white color that they have. They do fliker constintly but hard to notice while driving.They are not brighter then halogen bulbs but the optical illusion seems to put off more light. Still going strong after 3 months and I hope they last at least a year. For the price, you can't beat it... 2005 Magnum
B00L32LLPC|5|Arrived fast and in excellent condition. My boyfriend said it was easy to install and it looks great on his Ram 2014.
B00R6ZC0ZA|5|Real nice perfect for what I needed
B00AFRYAWC|4|Looks good, does the job to fill the gap in your ecoboost. Price is right, just a little too flimsy for me.
B000C57KN8|5|Worked well
B005UQ8NKI|4|I thought these &#34;Happy Smiley Face Sun Antenna&#34; decoration was too cute and perfect to bring a Smile to anyone's face.<br /><br />Very Lightweight, maybe an ounce, bright yellow in color, with black eyes and smile printed on this yellow, Styrofoam ball.
B00008RW9V|3|Picks up the dust, but leaves behind bits of red fuzz.
B000BKEBOU|3|Ended up not using it, but am tired of seeing it show up on my reviews (I order a LOT of stuff).  It might be great- others seem to have had good luck with it.  I ended up needing a new piece of pipe near the catalytic converter, which I figured out when I got out of my car to take the trash to the dumpster on my way to an appointment, and heard the noise under the hood, not the back end.<br /><br />As you were...
B001IWLCGU|1|Went through all the questions about car. Was given choice of wipers for that car. Bought them, but they were the wrong type of wiper. Had to pay to return them
B00BITJUUS|3|this is ok, fits
B006VOTFS2|5|Fits perfect on a 14 jku and sounds great too!! Light and smaller than the factory muffler and not annoying or very loud when you get on it sounds smooth and compliments the cold air intake well. For the price you can't beat it.
B000KIMHRQ|5|Performs all your most common auto electrical test procedures.<br />Good ergonomics; clear scales.<br />Most functions are auto-ranging.<br />Excellent carrying case.
B000MWLKSM|3|These are as advertised--strong, easy to install, and fit--but, unless you are a serious mud guy, they are too large for those of us just trying to protect the paint.  If weather tech would make the same thing in a little smaller size, I would buy it.  Sent mine--front and rear-- back and still looking for an alternative.
B0041F25CG|4|A bit bulky for just core removal (I have a dedicated tool for that), but the other parts of the tool will be handy when I need them.
B003VF1HJ4|5|Worked great
B004FOBM72|3|LAMPS THAT COME WITH HEADLIGHT UNITS WERE VERY DIM AND REFLECTED A VERY POOR LIGHT PATERN!<br />ALSO HAD TO DO SOME TRIMMING ON THE PLASTIC HOUSING POST TO GET THE UNITS TO FIT AND MOUNT UP.
B000CM3IA0|5|So glad I was able to find this here. My car is now all better.
B006PPM6CO|5|Really helps an ole retired vet get into the bed of his truck. Thanks
B00DOS0SOI|5|I recently bought this gallon size simply because of the price.  So many detailers cost 10 bucks or more for a 16 oz. size.  I use this as a glide for the scrubber (not so much as I used to as the Nanoskin bubble bath rocks) and a detailer spray.  It works fantastic as a detailer and it smells good!  If you wipe your car down as much as I do, that matters. It dries clear and does not streak.
B0010GG7YG|5|A+++ Awesome.  Highly recommend.
B001C6L5XC|1|s*** garbage,  broke upon install
B00QHPNZK4|5|Arrived today (early) and fit my Sport (a new-used car for me) perfectly.  A more-than-suitable alternative to the WeatherTech brand; the question will be longevity--but they should, I think...
B0027XYKZO|5|Great fit! My truck is getting better gas mileage and running a little better.  I've still got more to do but I can already notice the improvement.
B000ZAPEL0|1|These are CHEAP, took forever for them to ship. They are NOT worth the money. I will be returning them!
B00ELHTC1G|5|Lasted about 8-9k in my car. Exceeded my expectations
B000H7XJNQ|4|This fit my application (generac generator). The price was pretty good, but I don't like mail in rebates. Fast delivery and low cost shipping!
B00E3H5JJI|4|arrived on time. customer service tech was very helpful in setting the program up for my car. I'v had it a few weeks now and it has missed the signal a few times, but, that could be due to the heat were I live. I would recommend this product.
B00AMAL7NM|5|Great thank you i will be back with you, very nice and useful for me and my friends too yeah
B002NRD3EI|1|I order these for my 1996 ford van from super duper and when I got them I didn't like them so I return them but for some reason they said all the parts didnt arrive only thing they got was the bolbs.will never order from them again..would not recommend them to ANYONE........
B00EC0Z054|5|fit perfect, well made, would definitely do business again.
B007Z2PTFW|5|Product delivered on time but box was badly damaged and needed to go to the hardware store to get bolts and nuts as half were missing. Product meets my expectation and works great.
B001G5UNTQ|1|I got this fan quickly, so kudos there. I installed this fan, and it worked quite well cooling, until it literally flew apart in my engine bay. Almost the entirety of the plastic ring just came off. I do not recommend this fan or this company. I am getting a refund, and a different brand.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|These emit a longer &#34;throw&#34; (distance) of light. I can see much more now when backing up; they're almost like headlights, as you can see in the quality photograph I provided.<br /><br />There is an immediately noticeable difference between the JDM ASTAR LEDs and the original halogen reverse bulbs, upon installation.<br /><br />Lastly, the color is pure white, which additionally looks very aesthetically pleasing. Overall I highly recommend these for their quality.
B00CFBSGP8|1|Put it on my xp 1000 and is slipping after 50 miles. Junk!
B007JEJQP0|5|Great product! Easy to install! Instructions and all parts were complete. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hitch for their CRV
B000BQR100|5|Works great in my 2014 Mazda CX 5.  Fits well in the windows, keeps the car cooler.  Is it a miracle solution?  Of course not.  But, for the price, well worth it.
B000BKC25K|4|I used this product to free up a rusted screw jack stand on a utility trailer.  It worked, whereas WD-40 did not.
B00JYCGV44|5|excellent product.
B00BYHDATQ|5|Great product!
B00A23V5EU|1|within two weeks of installing this compressor a bolt came lose on the pump and started to make a very loud rattling noise. no problem to fix that problem. it is now 2 months since install and the unit has completely stopped working! and of course now it 30 days over warranty. I am  very disappointed with this purchase to say the least. I just hope I can save someone else the head ache.
B000SL2GNU|5|I bought two, one for my car and one for my backpack (I walk to and from work). They are the perfect size and have high quality items which is a nice change from other small kits. Also the quality on the case itself is excellent. I will be able to refill and reuse for years and years without worrying about breaking or cracking like plastic box first aid kits.
B00425QX8M|4|Does exactly what it is supposed to do and the price makes it a &#34;must have&#34; for anyone's tool chest.
B0057FQTVC|4|Perfect fit for my Yamaha Grizzly 700.
B000CM0WVS|5|sticks to old broken mirror,quick and easy fix.
B001PY93DU|5|This is the rear section of the parking brake cable on a toyota 4wd pickup or 4runner. I installed this parking brake cable on a Toyota 4x4 extended cab. It will also work for a regular cab.
B008YFTWLQ|5|Love them. Easy to install. Works great on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee..
B0027NOOBE|1|It has been only few months I had purchased and Installed HALO2 HID KIT LVQ 212-L300, Both (Bulb type D2S/D2R 35W) Electronic Control Gear for Xenon light bulbs are bad.  Bulbs are OK but one of the Electronic control stopped working in one or two months the other one just went bad.  It's big problem of driving without one lamp and take time in figuring out what is wrong.  I have purchased other manufactures and works fine. I had to replace both HID controllers of HALOAUTOMOTIVE. I have called HALOAUTOMOTIVE and left message.  I am just hopping to get replacement.  I will place comment on replacements.
B004NSJW9U|5|Crazy deal! Just got them in the mail 4 days and dang they look great. They look just like the factory made fog light. And they come with everything lights and everything. Made me love my 2004 Chevy Impala LS even more! Trust me you can't find them cheaper with this quilty!
B001TK7CYM|5|The goggles were purchased to go with the aviators leather helmet also purchased.  Both went well together and were a bit hit.
B007YWO3L4|4|Photo makes the lamp look the same size as the base, but it is larger and didn't fit into the housing.  Diameter listed on the drawing is accurate though--I just couldn't measure the housing's opening since it is difficult to get to.  (2009 Toyota RAV4 rear turn signals.)<br /><br />Brightness seems okay but I thought it would be brighter.
B0002SR27Y|5|perfect
B002IVD2MM|4|Just what I needed for an affordable price, but did not specify that it come with the screw knobs...spent an extra $15 that are now extras
B0041TOOHQ|5|Wow,<br /><br />I take pretty good care of my cars but really didn't think about the cabin air filter.  Normally Valvoline pesters the crap out of you trying to sell you extra stuff when you go in for an oil change.  They never even asked me about this filter.<br /><br />I have a 2009 Mazda 6 with 85K miles on it.  So, when I saw this on Amazon I figured it was at least due for a change.  It's behind the glove compartment.  Anyway, mine was absolutely black and absolutely, absolutely filthy.  I should have replaced it 40k miles sooner.<br /><br />Car gets much better air flow.
B000LG5UG2|5|worked perfectly.
B001P261M8|5|Easy installation.  Nice quality.  Perfect fit.  Recommended for those of you who want to accent your vehicle.  You won't be disappointed with the fit and finish of this trim.
B001DKDEUE|2|It's a sticker....not a decal. I gave it 2 stars because it's cute. I'm a female beekeeper so love the design. Wish it was a decal, though.
B00HXMFXE6|4|Appears to be a good replica of the current battery, the tools opened the phone and were sturdy enough for future use. However after replacement my phone still did not power on, my daughter dropped it in water and because the old battery was so mushy i thought for sure replacing it would resurrect it. No such luck,but I dont think it was because of the battery; there is something else wrong with the phone.
B000T9TLZM|5|After reading all the information regarding oil, zddp additives, (lack of) API certification, I bought 24 quarts for my brand new Honda Euro (Acura TSX). I won't be fooled by the API sticker, as it does not signify or indicate the quality of the oil.<br />I wasn't expecting to tell much difference after just 1000km on the odometer, but the difference was there! Time will tell how well those additives work, but I have faith in Redline.
B00H34DMME|5|I applied it on my leather seats right after I received it. It works great! By combing the glove that's include in the set, it scrubs off the dirt even more effectively. The most satisfied part to me is their customer service. I really like the way that they care about customers' satisfaction! I will definitely buy again!
B0041RPGQ6|5|Great product easy on wallet! I'm alway cold and hubby is alway hot.... this was a great item to have living with Chicago winters!!
B003U5OB9I|5|so much better than I thought it would be for the pricel Really sturdy thick material and plenty big for van or truck.
B000M5ZXIM|4|good creeper
B009PJJWYM|1|One of two failed within one year, second one is also showing premature wear. Rubber bushings have disintegrated, causing clunking noise during metal to metal contact between metal mount plate and underside of shock mounting point to vehicle body.
B001V8U12M|5|I don't want to sound lazy but why would you not want to have one of these and save cranking your jacks by hand.
B008VJXWMA|5|Good quality product . Sturdy enough to support loaded bags .Pleased with the purchase .
B002NCG2OG|5|I miss read the description. And when it arrived I was shocked.but after I noticed it was my mistake the company issued me a check and allowed me to return the item.that's 5 star if you ask me
B005GOM6PM|5|Somewhat difficult at times to peel off backing, but aggressive adhesive is excellent. Using it to patch Koi pond EPDM liner followed by top coating with PondPro 2000
B003O75N30|5|Lots of storage space, and an awesome pull-down map. My only issue is that it interferes with the rearview mirror I added, but with some repositioning, I think it will be fine.  Good quality, and enough straps to secure it to my 2013 Polaris RZR 800 without flapping. Even stays secure while on the trailer at highway speeds.
B0009JKGJW|2|I'm writing this review to warn you about the packaging of this oil. Marvel uses recycle number 3 plastic which is PVC to package this oil. All other oil manufactures use HDPE plastic to hold their product. PVC plastic that Marvel uses gets very brittle in cold temperatures. I had a bottle of Marvel shatter on me and spill all over and and I believe it was because of the type of plastic they use, either that or the oil itself causes the plastic to get brittle. It was 17 degrees out when this happened to me. I've never had a normal HDPE motor oil plastic container shatter on me so Marvel is doing something wrong here.<br /><br />As far as the oil itself... Sure it's a good product but if you live in a cold environment you better be careful with you Marvel oil container. I emailed Turtle Wax the makers of Marvel and haven't heard a response in 6 days. If it gets on your clothes it will take 3-4 washes before it gets out.<br /><br />Marvel check your inbox at info at turtlewax dot com for an email dated February 22, 2015 7:15 pm
B000BQ08QO|5|A year or more ago I bought one of these kits (from Amazon) for my 2002 Nissan pickup. It engendered a bit of cussing on the part of the (dull) mechanic figuring out how to install it (but he managed) and it has worked pretty well in the oil change role and like a CHAMP in the oil filter changing department.    In my opinion that should be the main marketing strategy for this product. It is much less expensive, more complete and as well made as any filter relocation kit to be found anywhere. I have researched this topic extensively twice.    I just rec'd my second kit- bought for my '87 Toyota Supra. Nothing has changed since I first researched the topic.    According to Spectre this kit is no longer being made, but they have a goodly number in their warehouse- but be advised that the number is finite as of now.
B0065T9TVG|5|Nice looking license frame... and I would rather be Golfing!!<br />Classy addition to my new ride... better than advertising for auto dealer!!
B00E40N7QG|5|They are great!
B007I5A53M|5|What more can you say Rigid Industries product is the real deal.  I put these in place of my stock fog lights, lets just say the fog lights actually are useful now.  I have a white vehicle so these just pop against the white bumper.  Great product very happy with Rigid Industries
B007VWYBZA|5|Excellent oil!!
B0000AZ6DP|4|Somehow my front seat and its pedastal have gone missing.  I would hate to think that I didn't properyly store it in the boat before hitting the highway, but that is the most likely answer.  I have a 95 Ranger Sport which seems to have more than its share of uniqueness from other Ranger boats.  The hole in the deck in which the pedastal is inserted is a very tight 3/4\\".    I was able to find a 3/4\\" adjustable pedastal, a plate to a attach pedastal to the seat and a very good quality seat on your website.  I was very pleased to find the full set of items from one dealer; it will hopefully make my life easier if I accidently ordered a set of incompatable parts.
B002R0N468|5|I was so grateful to find this on Amazon. Much better prices than the Honda websites. As a woman it was a bit of a struggle fitting it to the damaged front end, but I was successful. I got the how-to book on Amazon too.
B001G6PNRC|5|The bulb fits exactly and works fine. Arrived in good packing and on time. Since the size is too tiny need to be little bit careful while handling it.
B00068OOG2|5|Works great. Good instructions. Cons: Uses the old style glass fuse.<br /><br />Installed with MR. Gasket fan 16\\"
B00LC9DIHK|5|Fit same as the factory ones.
B002DVZ4BO|5|I have a Jetta with tan and black interior and wanted a cover that looked original, no butterflies or Hello Kitty.  It worked!!  The covers look awesome!!  It doesn't fit perfectly but if you take the time to pull the strings right it'll fit decently.  Yupbizauto e-mailed me an hour after I placed the order to ask what color I wanted the covers and got an e-mail immediately after it was shipped.  Great service!!
B003AV24N2|3|I assumed, you know judging from the picture and definition, that you would be getting the entire phrase that we all know and love. I was sorely mistaken. All I got was &#34;Dance like nobody's watching.&#34; Which is awesome I love that saying but not what I purchased. I will keep it because it is beautiful but the description needs to be clearly written. I wanted what was in the picture.
B000B8I61G|5|Are you running out of those cup holders that are built into your car?  Well if you are like my family it is not uncommon for each person to have 2 or even 3 drinks per person at a time.  I have spent the last 4 months purchasing cup holders at local auto parts stores.  But none of them worked well.  (By the way, most auto parts stores will not let you return them once they have been used.)  Then I purchased this one on Amazon.  And holy smokes it works great!  Our slushies, energy drinks and Dunkin Donuts coffee haven't spilled once.  And these things do a great job of holder other items.  Hot dogs, cell phones, cup o' noodles.  You name it!  buy your today!
B000N5QIE4|5|I love these connectors.  Whether you use the single shut-off or the dual shut-off these work great.  I race motorcycles and sometimes you need to remove the tank to access the cooling system or the top end of the engine.  Being able to shut off fuel flow from the tank or both the tank and the carb adds a great level of comfort when you're trying to work fast with minimal intrusions.
B006LIZ3D4|4|So far so good for this product it delivered on time as expected and it works great and easy to install reason for 4 stars 1 bulb did not work I don't know if I handled them right or if it came like that but I handled them the same way but overall this is a great product
B0062BHOOG|5|This is fantastic. I have really bad luck with flat tires, so when I pulled this out to check my tire pressure my boyfriend was impressed I owned one of these but rolled his eyes once he realized it was digital. He watched me use it and then told me he would go ahead and check the rest of my tires... Needless to say we both think it is awesome and is an accurate reader. It displays other stuff, but Im not concerned with it. The little blue light is also helpful when you have to use it at night or in low light.
B00192JGDU|5|The table is great. Plenty of room for items needed to grill.
B0055ELS6G|4|One mirror Is cracked a lil a lil sad about it But till goin on my 98 teggy ls<br /><br />  Dubz
B000BZZEKK|2|be aware it said these would fit my vehicle but they did not.
B00DM9R7CK|5|Exactly what I wanted, got here quickly. My car is quiet as a mouse and smooth as butter now. I certainly will order another if I need it.
B01092IEEM|5|It's was excellent  product and I love it
B00K764TCC|5|Love it.
B00NM1XL0K|4|This product was amazing and the company was incredibly helpful when they by accident  sent out the wrong reverse lights. Purchase and you will not regret it. I will continue to purchase from amazon  and this comoany. Only flaw was they, at first, seemed to be built cheap. But lights hold up amazing amd work amazing
B000A0CAWQ|5|Perfect!
B0002M9TTO|5|Great light at a even greater price.  everything needed to mount except wireing. even had stone covers included. love them  thanks
B000IZ4904|2|I bought two of these - one for both mine and my wife's car. I was only able to successfully install it on my car because the pin that holds the valve open for draining broke while I was installing it on my wife's.<br /><br />The hexagonal head of the plug is very large compared to the OEM drain plug. The valve cap is very difficult to avoid when attempting to tighten the plug, and it was incredibly difficult to get a wrench around it due to the tight clearances on my drain pan. I ended up having to use a cheap pair of pliers to tighten it because none of my wrenches or sockets would fit around the head of the plug with enough clearance to turn it.<br /><br />I've changed the oil once on my car since installing, and It took nearly 2 hours to drain due to the limited flow rate introduced by the smaller diameter of the valve opening.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not pleased with the product, though the idea is a great one.<br /><br />After researching other, similar products that seem to be of much better quality, I think I'm going to go back to an OEM style drain plug and just buy an oil extractor, which is approximately the same price as the other, better drain plugs. The bonus is, I can use it on both cars.
B00782RKYC|5|Key chain looks great and matches the cars paint and fits perfect in your pocket
B005FI5BBA|5|This is a great plate frame, just as it appears. After reading the other reviews for how it covers the verification sticker I was worried however it did not do this at all on my car. Totally a must have for all those Whovians.
B00KRNM1SE|4|Good quality Motorcycle seat gel , very squishy !
B00IQ2Z0D6|5|Great product,this is the fourth one I purchased. Keeps all my batteries charged!!
B000KL71OW|4|These do what they say, but the show turns to water and gets on the hem of your pants and they are so hard to get out of the car, I have to mop up the water.
B001GJ3ECA|2|Not everything promised, easily bends and losses bristles, not long enough.  Not overly happy with the product and would get a longer or bigger brush.
B0068C2BJM|5|Excellent product and excellent quality, you should buy this
B0040HA9Y6|4|I was very happy with this item.
B00DG1TADI|5|Look great. Makes cleaning a lot easier
B008BMP6P8|5|Fantastic part! Made to fit perfect and finish is outstanding! !
B000GBS6BS|5|I bought this helmet as a replacement for my [[ASIN:B0018QBQEY Shoei TZ-R Helmet]] (see my review there to help with the comparison), which was about due for retirement after a couple of years and at least one accidental drop.<br /><br />The RF-1000, like the X-11, TZ-R, and Multitec helmets, uses the [[ASIN:B001A6GSIG Shoei CX-1V face shields]].  I was glad to see this, because it meant I could transfer my existing shields to the new helmet.<br /><br />The fit seems similar to that of the TZ-R, which is good.  It's comfortable on long rides, more so in my case than the Multitec is, which doesn't seem to fit my head shape as well. It's a quiet helmet too -- not as quiet as the TZ-R, but pretty close.  This is definitely high praise, as the TZ-R is the quietest helmet I've ever had.<br /><br />Build quality, as expected for Shoei, is excellent. Between noise level and build quality, you can definitely tell where your money goes.  Getting a helmet from a low-priced manufacturer is certainly easier on the wallet, and may even provide similar levels of protection from impact (I don't know, but at least they are generally DOT and SNELL certified). But compare the build quality, comfort, and noise level on them, and you'll want to spend the extra money from then on.<br /><br />Ventilation is an improvement over the TZ-R as well. For my particular head shape, the ventilation is partially obstructed.  But this is the case with all helmets I've tried. If I put on an RF-1000 that's one size too big for me, I can feel a serious breeze coming through the top of the helmet and out the back. It works perfectly, but apparently I have a weird head that slows the flow when I'm wearing my normal size helmet.<br /><br />I went to a local shop and tried on the X-11.  I suppose there's a definite reason somewhere that makes that helmet worth the significant price hike, but honestly I couldn't tell by trying them on side by side. Both the RF-1000 and X-11 were comfortable, and I don't know if I could tell the difference without looking.<br /><br />Bottom line, this helmet is a great buy.  If you're coming from another Shoei helmet, chances are good your helmet size will be the same.  If you're coming from another manufacturer or buying your first helmet, it will be worth it to go to a shop and try one on first.t looking.    Bottom line, this helmet is a great buy.  If you're coming from another Shoei helmet, chances are good your helmet size will be the same.  If you're coming from another manufacturer or buying your first helmet, it will be worth it to go to a shop and try one on first.
B004ZF4930|5|I like the headlight so far... It work good and very bright... I receive it on the time... It was easy to install...I definitely recommend it...
B00RBF0782|1|Buyer beware!  Read item description carefully.  Advertises 4 pillows, describes 4 pillows in headline. Only two very small low quality pillows. I feel scammed.
B00826OVWW|3|Purchased this item and when I got it the black triangle metal guards were cracked, they sent the wrong kind of coaster wheel it wasnt threaded so I couldn't even attach it to the creeper. Now I have to waste more time ordering another wheel for it. It'll work for what I need it for but I definitely will not be purchasing another one from this company.
B000WK8DM0|5|really like the windshield. made a big difference when riding scooter on a cool day.i certainly would buy another one
B009SHJH00|5|Fast Shipping, lights worked great and look great. Thanks
B006J9XZE4|5|Looks great thanks
B00292DSAG|5|Great replacement set, includes the replacement bulbs which was nice. Took me about 10 minutes to swap out, perfect fit, great value.
B00VJ1D34O|5|BEAUTIFUL FINISH, GOOD INSTRUCTIONS & EVERYTHING INCLUDED
B0048A0FI0|3|This product was not what I expected. I eventually purchased a different brand.
B00404WDUC|5|works great
B00076BFAG|4|The order was shipped promptly with no problems. The helmet sizes do tend to run a little snug, so go bigger rather than small if your measurement is borderline.
B000AM8C62|5|I first started using Tufoil on my 1978 Corvette (original owner).Sold the car last year with 310,000 miles on the original engine.I've used it on all my vehicles and marine engines.Currently,driving a 2003 Toyota Highlander with 235,000 miles.Engine sounds like new. My boat has twin 7.4 L. MPI engines(1999) with 560 hours on them.They idle and run like new, or even better than new. I swear by Tufoil. It protects your engine from heat in the summer and cold in the winter.
B00469HOOG|4|This cart has plenty of room to store all your car care essentials.  The grids keep grit and grime away from the water as you clean.  Would be nice if it had locking wheels, but still a great product without.
B0033WDDZ6|5|Heavy well built hitch & very easy to install. Down side is not many people will have a 1/2\\" Allen or Hex head wrench for the tapered bold that goes though the ball hole in the bumper. The tapered bolt will stick up out of the hole on top of bumper and look a little tacky but they may use this type of bolt to keep hitch center and not moving when the trailer is on.
B007RVTBF0|5|i love these spark plugs, not too expensive and great for gas mileage!!
B00393VAS6|4|Excellent replacement bulb for my Toyota Tercel 87. Don't expect a huge difference, mainly you will notice color of the light and a 10% increase on lightning, as i mentioned is a good replacement. You may need to get used to light color but overall is a good product with outstanding manual/instructions.
B003QUGPW8|4|Excellent for around the house and on the car. They should last a good while if you know how to properly care for microfiber towels
B000GASX9O|4|I have received my converter, but have not been able to install it yet.  If it does what it says, then I will be a happy camper.  The price was nice, although cost me another 18 bucks from Canada customs.  Still cheaper then buying one in Canada.
B004I1NH5W|5|Great Vest for the price. Higher quality and more features than I ever expected.I would recommend this product to anyone starting out on motorbiking. I highly recommend.
B004107292|5|work nice and super easy
B0073XMXMK|5|This antenna works great for satellite radio, navigation, HD radio and standard radio! I have had no problems with this antenna.
B002QSD3YE|5|i ordered two of these systems, one for my truck, and one for my dads truck. we were both pretty happy with the purchase. Great sound and pretty easy to install. If you are thinking 5&#34; i would not go that route. it was tight clearance going from the 3.5 to the 4&#34;. I am getting alot better fuel milage with no cat and no muffler. at least 2/gallon. i didnt think that it would really help and that the company just says that to sell systems but my dad and i have both noticed. Good product
B000VY9R1I|5|I thought I was buying a fuse to replace a broken one in a portable air compressor in my car.  The price was good.  The package came so quickly, but, there were five of them for the price, not just one.  I put in the new fuse, and the compressor was ready to air the tires again, with four backup fuses.
B006BMC752|3|Not well thought out
B00080QHMM|4|Seems to be pretty accurate when tested with other gauges.
B002AU0G2A|5|Good price, fast shipping. I installed these on my 2010 Honda Rancher with no problems at all.  It took me about an hour. These fit just like they were from Honda and look great. Since I put bigger tires on my Honda, these were a great addition to keep mud off of me. Recommend !
B00AHI4O0W|5|Great quality  fast shipping what more can you ask.
B00913NS42|5|i am very pleased with these seat covers, i am glad i went for the custom set, not as difficult as i imagined they would be, front was harder than the rear especially when i figured out my rear seats did pull up
B007IIR9M4|5|Fast shipping and have finally found a blade that fits my FJ Cruiser,works well under highway speed no chattering haven't tried in snow but work well with bugs.
B00B5NPL7I|5|for the price i thought these things would only last me like a month, but its been more than a month and they still work if you are looking for some lights for you car these are one of the best for the price
B0002M9WHS|5|Glad I finally found a place that sells these w/out having to buy the lights. They are the same quality as the originals. Fit as well too. They will most likely melt as well if they are left on while the lights are on. Of course, they will eventually give out and break, but not for a while. For the price, you cant get better Shields. Will buy again as long as they are available.
B008WXL0UQ|5|Fast shipping & great product.
B0057FK0ZS|5|came quick. price was cheep . only took 4 min. to install. will buy it again. it was an easy job and i like that
B000ET9SAU|1|I read some things here about amperage, and perhaps they are right. Used this on my 2006 Dodge Charger many times without incident. Then 1st use on 2014 Mustang GT and I smell something burning (the adapter plug that goes in lighter). Took it apart and saw the fuse unblown, but wires behind the spring melted and burnt. Seems hard to believe that it could be coincidence that it didnt work with new car.
B0091YV1F4|5|only had them installed for a week or so now,i swapped out my stock bulbs for these in my cars gauge cluster.so far they are great very bright and blue like i wanted
B000BO0528|5|Royal Purple is a excellent synthetic oil. I now use this oil in all of my vehicles (with differing weights)    I have an 2008 F150 that has the notorious hot idle Cam Phaser tick. I tried many oils/weights to try to get rid of this, but finally tried RP 10w40 and it has silenced my cam phasers (the thinner weights of RP reduced it, but did not get rid of it).    In my other vehicles, I use 5W20 (winter) or 10w30 (summer) and it has made each one run very quietly and smoothly. I even think I may be getting better fuel economy.    While all synthetics are good, what sets RP apart form the others is it's Synerlec additive. This additive is a very tenacious, slippery additive that reduces friction and almost significantly reduces wear. If you look on YouTube at the Timken machine tests with RP, you can see demonstration of just how good this additive is. While the Timken machine is not the end all, be all, test for oils, it does demonstrate just how good RP is in extreme pressure situations when the oil film is cut through due to engine stress.    With a great additive pack and real Group IV (PAE) base oil (most synthetics today use a cheaper Group III base oil with only a few exceptions) this oil protects extremely well and keeps your engine very clean - not to mention with it's 12 Total Base Number (TBN), it has enough acid neutralizers to be a long drain oil up to 10k miles (my maximum), although others have pushed much further.    If you decide to try, make sure to follow the instructions and do two short Oil Change Intervals (OCIs) of about 3000 miles before extending the OCIs - this will let RP clean up your motor and get it's Synerlec well imbedded into the metal surfaces of your engine. After the two short OCIs, you can push the OCI to whatever limit you are comfortable with. Some comments on here have suggested the quietness has gone away after a few thousand miles - and that is because they did not start with the two short OCIs - with this approach engines remain quiet for any length OCI.
B000KL5DKG|5|Not cheap but good quality, domestically produced item. Really glad I bought them. My carpets would really be a mess otherwise!
B0070Y345C|5|super bright and really cool looking
B00KHA4J9G|1|While the product may work I will never pay nearly $16 again for so little.  If Swan charged a reasonable price maybe more people would use their product
B000A3I9XW|3|The screwdriver itself looks like a cheep screwdriver that will work. My rating reflects that I didn't get the correct driver and it's not worth the return hassle for 2 bucks.
B00M9QZ7FQ|5|This are great! !!!
B0002F68JK|2|After consulting several users that insured me it was the correct mode.<br />WASN'T! !<br />It cost me $8.50 to return it for credit !<br />But buy getting the 2407 I discovered on the outside of the box which was the correct one to order.<br />Long story short, never believe the comments posted on products.
B001KSARRM|5|We were having trouble with a rolling misfire on our 07 Sierra Denali truck. And after talking to AC-Delco directly this was the NEW part number that was recommended. The MU1847 Unit was a direct fit and installation was simple with an almost empty fuel tank. I am glad that I ordered this part instead of the original because according to Delco this is an improved version of the original. Oh and the rolling misfire issue is gone and truck idles smooth as glass now.
B0017OCJ66|5|Hopefully these will last longer than the Sylvanias, those were a total failure.
B0010DZZQA|5|Was perfect for my Toyota echo 2003.
B00C70NPRQ|4|Great product and good price too
B0002MA56U|5|Came as described. Use your own hardware...they work well though.
B0040DXAWI|5|Much better view of blind spots.  Will always buy a broadway for any car I own
B007LIBU8U|3|Had it for about a month so far and its ok . My only wish is that it had slot or screws at the bottom so the bottom of the plate could be connected so it would not rattle.
B00418TXN2|4|I wanted something that looked &#34;blingy&#34; for my Honda S-2000.  I bought this frame because it was metal.  My only wish is that the crystals were brighter colors. The light has to catch this one just right before it is noticeable.  I saw a plastic one in an auto parts store with hot pink crystals, but only one row of crystals. I was afraid it would soon break, so I opted for the metal frame.
B00BEIUBCO|1|I hated this helmet the only thing it had going for it was it looked nice but I know what size helmet I wear so I ordered that size and it was way to big also it does not keep the wind out at all I would have to say it's the worst helmet I might as well have been wearing a half helmet complete waste of 45 bucks
B00IVKYOE4|3|This is a good quality sticker. But think it would make more sense if it read &#34;I drive a pickup because I'm insecure&#34;. This one just kind of beats around the bush. 3 stars for beating around the bush.
B00EUH0CTI|3|Very good for the price
B000XUC5TQ|5|Hello,<br />  Just want to let you know. I purchased a set of Toyota hub caps and they were Excellent<br />Match to the OE hub caps. Totally satisfied and high quality, sent in an timely manner.Would<br />buy from this customer again.
B004P3RKMO|5|Handy solution for mounting rocker switches in a Jeep TJ.  It may be just me, but I didn't realize that this only replaces one of the two center vents.  So with two of these, you could mount 4 switches.  I only needed two switches so it worked out great. You will need to cut these.  I used an exacto knife and scored the existing rectangle on the back.  Once I removed the rectangular section I still had to shave the opening to get my switches to fit.  Once they go in, they are never coming out with pretty much destroying the pod.  Overall, a slick and inexpensive solution for mounting a pair of rocker switches. I recommend this product.
B000K8WYZG|5|It was a bit heavier than I thought it was going to be. However, the detail on this is absolutely beautiful and exquisite!
B0088P06AS|5|Worked as directed and its 3M
B005RPID0W|5|First off, they shipped the item within like 2 days, on time. Second, the LED's look great. Definitely an upgrade if you like LED's with color. I don't know where they were manufactured, but they seem like they're ok quality...they also gave me a few doubles;)
B00P59CFBS|5|HUGE pain in the @ss to install, but they fit reasonably well and have been doing a great job protecting my seats.
B000EQU1DQ|5|Not the exact same low tone as the stock horn but it's loud enough to scare the you know what out of them! I had to splice the two spade connectors on after cutting off the factory plug. Small area to work in on my 2001 Tahoe.<br /><br />Note: Mount the horn opening down!
B0059JTY0O|1|cheap looking sliders, nothing like the picture, these are short frame sliders maybe an inch long on the wide area, I would have never bought them had I known that they look nothing like the picture
B001LHQBMC|1|This scan tool was a flop for me I tried it on 2 vehicles and it would have a communication error look at the plug and the pins were not all at an even highth looks like better quality control on this one would have helped
B0072W5PFO|5|Headlights are great and shipped fast ! Thanks
B00MYFHJ80|4|I love this cover it just needs to have a center strap on it to help hold it down in the wind.
B0057YHZJ8|5|Great easy to use siphon in for the right application. Doesn't work to get gas out of most cars because filler necks are restricted. Good for servicing power equipment.
B003CE283I|5|This Flip automatic jack foot is so awesome!  It adds 6 inches to the height of my jack and flips out of the way automatically when I am hitched up and ready to travel!  It is really a no-brainer!  The foot even has a template hole to drill the pilot hole in your jack tube, made it a heck of a lot easier to get the hole in the right spot!  My only challenge was that I had to drill the hole in the v-groove on the side of my jack tube.  Since it is a v-groove, the drill would just bite into the sides, and I couldn't drill the hole, but I ended up drilling from the opposite side and got it to work!  I absolutely love this thing!!!  Just make sure you don't tighten the bolt too tight, otherwise it won't be able to slide in the slot.
B000BRCKTG|5|perfect fit
B001AM8F36|5|the shocks were what i expected.  the price was cheaper as i checked around first.  I bought 4 and the price was right.  easy to install and my truck rides great.
B00AG6ECL6|5|Genuine BMW part and works as expected. Just pick up a few studs as those are the ones that'll snap on you...and break off in the cap nut. If you have an I6 BMW, you're going to get a valve cover leak sooner or later. Pick up spares and if the rubber is old, dry, and super compressed on your old cap nuts; buy a complete new set.
B003NE119O|5|Perfect replacement ... Appeared nearly identical to OEM.  Easy installation.
B000HTAH70|5|I should have bought one of these YEARS ago. Much easier and more accurate than a center punch & hammer!
B000VLV5HU|5|Great quality.
B001UC3BOO|1|After driving 100 miles the rubber in the pulley separated damaging my timing cover.
B00027GL3Q|4|Includes all but the tube gasket for the drive shaft tube. I went to hardware store and bought some that work.
B001UL0E2M|5|is what it is and worked
B00BFU85RO|2|I bought several rolls and applied according to directions.  Very disappointing to put it mildly.  I was expecting it to seal a few small leaks and it did not do that.  I guess that I will go back to the old wet r dry roof cement and roof screening.
B00P9EJGR0|5|Since switching my toddler to front facing, he has been kicking the back of the passenger seat like crazy.  With it being winter, his shoes are constantly wet or muddy and it was really taking a toll on the seat, it was becoming very dingy and gross looking.  I was lucky to enough to receive these kick mats to review and they couldn't have come at a better time.  They work great, they stay in place and are durable, and the back of the car seat is staying clean.  These kick mats are a most have for parents who have toddlers/children who enjoy kicking the car seats in front of them.  What a genius idea and they have saved my car seats from being filthy and have saved me time now that I don't constantly have to clean them.
B00BD4SK0Y|5|These seat covers are not made of the highest quality fabric (very thin) and I knew that when I ordered them; however, they look great and serve the purpose.  They are soft and look sporty in my 2002 Mazda Miata. I would recommend them if you just want to cover leather seats that get too hot.
B002DNC1YA|1|The picture shows black airline included with purchase. I received a cheaper, lower quality &#34;orange&#34; airline that was not flexible whatsoever. Therefore, had to contact a local shop to buy airline which was an inconvenience and extra money spent.
B00F7H04UM|4|I put the decal on my new cmax. Buy American
B00M0DHCJC|5|Awesome; )
B007PLZGO2|5|Down-right funny stuff!
B004USBKWA|5|Fit exactly like they should, no issues with a 2012 JKUR
B005F2WH1I|5|Smooth installation and it works great.  Can't ask for more than that.  This is my second experience with a Dorman regulator; both have been great.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|fits great
B003O75U60|5|Has to be the best on market I get so many compliments,  I'm aactually buying s second pair just to keep.great item
B000SIFO3M|2|I guess you get what you pay for.  The thread stripped after the first tire rod end was pulled.  The bolt wouldn't turn thereafter.
B00AQ29FNK|3|I ended up breaking two of these while I was trying to put them on, but it wasn't worth the hassle of doing anything else with them, so I just dumped em in the garbage.
B008BRJ5FA|5|As advertised.
B003AKNUJ0|5|You get what you pay for with spark plugs. If you don't want to pay as much for platinum plugs, plan on replacing them sooner. If you haven't changed spark plugs before, it's an easy diy project on most cars. Just make sure to get a spark plug socket (these plugs fit a 5/8&#34; size spark plug socket), some anti-seize paste (I like ceramic) and dielectric grease (currently using msd spark guard). Took me about 30 mins and saved $150 versus going to the dealership.
B007KBQ1PA|4|UNC part is not that bright blue, damn near grey
B001GRMM0M|5|The best set of mats ever made. Its tough to drop a hundred bucks on car mats but I have never had buyers remorse afterwards and i have bought 3 sets of these over the years. Great quality product made on this continent
B0040D2TGG|4|Like most cars eventually these clips fall out of wiggle loose or disappear these are solid replacements. I'd recommend them.
B005DLNDVY|5|The mirrors fit just right and they work as they should.
B000ICNU34|5|Slightly longer than the $24.00 dealership oil filter the owner handed me with the car I bought from him, this one fits perfectly and look at the price.  At $4.37 each I will take it in a heartbeat.  Check amazon for Smart ForTwo cabin air filters too.  I found them here at a saving of about $30 per filter.
B00JBIC6TA|5|These look amazing! The quality is very close to oem. And the shipping was very quick!
B0001L0DFA|5|Works great, easy to adjust.
B001FE38B8|5|Very happy with the LeBra. The paint was peeling away on my front bumper and the cost of painting was to high so I went with the LeBra and it work perfectly. Really glad I went this route.
B00LP4P942|5|Awesome light for motorcycle or quad!
B00CFL8T0K|2|The rubber seal had to be glued to the door as the item would not stay fixed to the door with the adhesive already on the rubber seal. Other than that the rubber seal was okay. You just need to use your own glue to attach it to the door of you vehicle.
B0014XCERY|5|works great
B005KWD1HM|5|Very easy to mount, no problem with cops seeing it on visual inspection, have had no tickets, is legal in Arizona.
B00480N0E6|1|Please review and correct what automobiles Amazon claims this light will fit.  I'm apparently not the first to order this light because Amazon's \\"will it fit\\" information is incorrect.  It does NOT fit a 2008 VW Rabbit like Amazon says it will...I can't speak for the quality of the light since it will go unused (sending back would cost just as much as item), but I am giving a poor review due to misinformation about the product.
B004SX5HNA|3|received package right on time.install was easy tho brackets were a hard fit and had to be redone.i did not receive the necessary wiring with the lights and contacted the company,never got a responce.since they took special wiring and connectors i had to add an additional 15 bucks to the cost.after instal lights worked great but two would not work,when i switched with two that did work to test them i found out the control box malfunctioned and only would work 2 sets at a time and not all three.after all the problems were worked out i have two sets that work great and a third set should one ever burn out.price was acceptable since you get what you pay for,im satisfied but disappointed with the company
B001CJHU9W|5|This is a very high quality pressure GUAGE.  It is not an inflator.  My mistake and will order an inflator of the same quality.
B001U7HYC4|4|Works and adheres well. I would recommend
B0006303NU|5|Worked perfectly on my high compression engine. Would highly recommend it to others that have problems starting high compression engines.
B006HYKTU4|4|It's so bright and we loved but This set is not complete for 2014's, Honda has changed the map lights base on 2014 so 4 dome lights, 2 map lights, 2 courtesy on the front door has same style base.<br /><br />I bought this set for my 2014 Elite and i always one set for spare so after installing the first set i was short on two map lights, thanks god i had second set so i used two lights from the second set.<br /><br />If you have 2014 don't buy this set or buy two sets.
B00B0QWXW6|5|AAAA+++++
B00ARJONDE|1|Part did not work. When the part was tested it was found to have insufficient charge.
B004GO63MU|2|I purchased this grill for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500. The grill in the picture here isn't what came. I have a friend with a 2003 Ram 2500 and it fits his. The bottom left and right sides aren't slanted like the picture they are round like the 02-05 body style. Hopefully the seller will replace it with the correct part. Will update this review accordingly.
B00BGEQT1I|5|Very satisfied with the pack after using it on a recent 6-day bike trip.  Very comfortable to wear while cycling all day and just the right size. The outside pocket is perfect for keys, phone and other small items.  The hydration potion can be easily removed to make it a nice day pack. Smart and sleek looking along with the trusted Ogio quality.
B005EIFG7U|5|If you know bearings for motorcycle applications, then you're familiar with \\"all-balls\\" aready. These bearings cover a variety of applications and they're top-notch. Shipping was fast and the price from Amazon was a huge relief.
B000X23WNW|5|I wanted something other than a rubber mat for the trunk of my car. The WeatherTech cargo liner fit the bill. Not only is it made of a tough substance, but it has an edge around around it to help keep dirt, leaves, and whatever from spilling over onto the carpet beneath. I think this is important when it comes to the resale of a vehicle -- appraisers are looking for a clean, well kept vehicle. The trunk probably doesn't rank very high in an appraiser's review, but the psychological aspect of a clean trunk cannot be denied, and affects the viewer's judgment.<br /><br />This product is well worth the money I spent on it.
B000JFNAJY|4|The only complaint i have for the unit itself is you would think someone who makes such a great product could come up with a better way to store the battery clamps for transport. the clamp holders do not hold the clamps- they are allways draggiong behind- buyers of this pruduct have to come up with creative ways to keep the clamps hook onto the unit
B000630B00|1|DO NOT BUY THIS!!! the wiring is very thing and while having it installed the whole thing broke. Really bad quality of wires and not a very smart design, it is impossible to installed without damaging either your car or the wire itself. It might look nice but it is not worth it trust me!
B005X85IF6|5|These are a great light.  They are comparable to a Whelen lamp when used as a single bar.  I believe that the Whelen lights would let you syncronize multiple light bars.  That has not been an issue for me.  I've installed three ECCO 5580 light bars at different times.  Installation is pretty simple for anyone that knows 12v wiring and how to run wires.  I haven't had any problems with the 5580's.
B005GLXW7G|5|Easy to install
B0009IR03I|5|Exactly what I need for my oil change job.
B00120JYDQ|5|Thanks, Fast Shipping Great product, would recommend..Thanks again
B0096QB8HI|3|Lettering peeled a little. Good quality frame poor quality lettering
B00CKZL8JK|5|Hubby loved it!!  I thought it would be bigger, but he said it was perfect. Very satisifed customer.  Will recommend.
B003VLBPJA|5|fits and adjust as needed<br />good quality<br />appears it will last a long time and fits in nice small compartment
B001O3FUJI|3|It look different
B00BGEO7DK|4|They look nice, I have a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, The only issue I had was the drivers side tab holes did not match up so it sits above one of them.
B00JRE38EA|5|they work great, bright, and cool
B002M91BRI|4|Please do not buy it if you are looking for actual glass . Its different quality but fits well, dual sided, easy to install, better visibility and view then some replacement glass available. Good to get the temporary stuff done. Happy with the product but I was looking for an actual glass. this product is a life saver just buy a better a dual side tape. better then what i expected.
B00CODF4P2|5|Fits true to size.  Happy With my purchase
B00825NB24|4|Works very well.  Installed this to cure the loss of my idiot light on my wrecker.  Previous one I was using started dropping segments of the led display.  Love the blue display on this EXCEPT during daytime, it's a little harder to read; no problem at night or on overcast days.
B00426N1HM|5|I'm no expert on snatch blocks, but this seems very well made.  I was able to easily pull my fathers chevy tahoe out of a deep ditch with the Rugged Ridge and a TJM 9000# winch.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone!
B000A8MNB6|5|This model, 192403, works on all Toyota Celica 2000-2005 models. Attaches to the Celica by included strong mounting tape. No clips or hooks. It's probably 3M mounting tape. Clean surface with rubbing alcohol. Let it dry. Peel a little bit in the front. stick it on. 1/3 of the way through, open and close the door fully to see if it binds. Re-align if necessary. It's a 10 minute install.
B006VXNGVK|5|Thank U :-) תודה רבה
B00AK1007M|5|The La Rosa craftsmanship is excellent. The leather is soft yet sturdy and the stitching is perfect. Rivets are tight and the buckles are high quality.  The three points that attach to the frame are my only concern.  There is no reinforcement to the slits cut into the leather that the straps are feed through, but the leather is thick and it would take a deliberate act to rip them. The side arm bag quality is well worth the price and they're smokin' hot looking on my 2010 Denim Black Harley Forty-Eight.
B00KSO60W0|5|The lights were very nice!!

B00L4TF32G|5|good stuff and much less expensive from Amazon!
B00139YMUQ|5|I love this tire gauge. As being particular about the exact PSI reading on my low profile tires, this is a necessary tool for the garage or tool kit. I highly recommend this tire gauge. It measures down to 1 tenths place PSI.
B00B86P898|5|Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)  replacement. Great price, 1/3 of what my local dealer wanted and they were going to have to order it as well. Plugged right on to replace a broken knob.
B00UVYJVP0|3|It's okay. I wish the edges were finished better so they would be smoother, since your hand runs along it. It stretches and fits fine though.
B00180P07O|5|helped fix the check engine problem
B00AC4SK42|5|I love it! No one has one so I feel special. I love football and I love representing for my Broncos. It really gives my truck that a little extra!
B000QTOQ32|5|Great Work lite, hanger flexible
B000KL6Y8G|5|Gave this as a Christmas gift to my son- loved it! and just in time as the dog got sick on the way home!
B005DX6BRK|5|A quality product which operates as described when installed according to the instructions.<br />I would recommend thoroughly reading and understanding the instructions prior to installing the DRLs.<br />Make 100% sure you are happy with the placement of the lights as it would be very difficult to unclip them<br />from the strong metal mounting brackets.<br />Very happy with this purchase.
B004IA8M0S|5|cheap made but eh worth the price
B0019V0R2K|5|I am very pleased with this product. It Goes great with my new car!  I Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00BCRM9YA|5|Looks great
B000OZ37OM|2|This seemed like a great solution to my dilemna.  I have a Jayco pop-up camper and I wanted to use my hitch-mounted bike rack to take bikes while camping.  Once you attach the hitch ball, the second hitch receiver isn't high enough to place the bike rack in before hooking up the trailer.  There's not enough clearance.  You have to hook up the trailer first and then insert the bike rack.  My pop-up camper has the standard wheel on the tongue of the trailer to raise and lower the tongue of the trailer and it does not lower such as some boat trailers.  It stays vertical and is right where the bikes would hang from the bike rack so when turning it would more than likely hit the bikes.  Not to mention my propane tank for the trailer is also right there.  I'm sure it works great for a boat trailer.  If you have a boat trailer and are considering this, try looking on ebay and buy them used from those that tried it with a camper!  I'm giving it a 2 out of 5 since it does what it claims, just doesn't seem to be universal.
B000B69V7Q|5|This Dorman replacement part is a perfect fit!  It is made as well as the OEM, if not better.  Enough said!
B001OXZ1IS|5|Product arrived very quickly, was in great shape, and worked wonderfully!<br />I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a good replacement or simply a second cord for switching vehicles. Color and design work out great with pretty much any vehicle setup.<br />When it comes down to it the question is, Would I buy again?. The answer is certainly, Yes I would!
B0000DEW8P|4|I bought an earlier model three years ago in exchange of high chair that was given to me at my babyshower casue it had been recalled. The chair reclines!! what better feature than that? I loved it..The only con is that the tray did release a little too easy and i was afraid she would fall one day when she had enough strength, and the straps with enough strenght would pop out the back...My daughter is now 3 and even tho she does not use it anymore she never had an accident in it. Im getting this new version (hoping) that the tray and straps have been updated...I would just be more careful not leaving her alone in it, because i canot do without it!
B00C7Y8LGW|3|Somewhat low quality. The metal gate rods didn't fit snug into the plastic clips on the back of the handle. I had to wrap some electrical tape around one of them to make them tight. Otherwise it seems to be working fine.
B000CMDQUM|5|if you can't reach it<br />it isn't your fault<br />get the right tool<br />well made<br />looks good<br />different from what you have already
B003AU1BP0|2|Sounded like a good idea. It gets in the way when trying to buckle. Too floppy. It retracts in wrong position some of the time. Too much work.
B001C3XD0S|1|China Junk. Don't waste your money
B00332GO4I|3|Good for the price.  One is a hair short, one is a hair long...a little frustrating to be honest, but I'm the only one who will ever notice. Easy to install. Came faster than I expected.
B000UKBI60|5|Good information.
B0042LHX4E|4|Good buy. Car runs smoother and my fuel consumption has dropped.
B002SE1G9U|4|I enjoyed adding this to my f150 The description said it would fit my truck and it did except the back door. the vent shade for the the back doors were to long so I was unable to use those.
B00FQ8U9DE|4|I bought this fog lights for my 2015 journey. My journey is the American value package.<br />The package comes with everything you need to install the fog lights, the instructions are not So easy. The pictures in the instructions are in black-and-white and you have to read really carefully.<br /><br />Be aware if you install those lights yourself you will still have to take it to the dealer so they can be activated with the dealers computer, (star scan)<br /><br />They had to flash my whole computer because the software that comes with the 2015 American value package does not support fog lights.  ($110.00 charge from the dealer)
B000BN3UIK|5|IT FIT JUST LIKE IT SHOULD ,QUICK INSTALL,I WILL BE ORDERING THE OTHER 4 HANDLES SOON,THANK YOU SO MUCH MR GIBSON.
B004NV6FE2|3|Nothing is easy about changing a motorcycle tire manually. My husband was having a hell of a time and even with me helping him, it took us a long while and some other tools in the mix to change the tire. I don't think these are that helpful but probably would have been worse without them. We are definitely going to invest in a better tool or system for the next tire change.
B001KS2PXQ|5|excellent
B00B36BDGA|3|Paint is thin had to use seven cans on a small car

B000MS9VZK|4|&#34;I'm working on my 4th Optima Battery istalled in a BMW and my Isuzu Amigo. Optima would not recomend I install in my Bimmer because according to them, there was not enough clearance and air-flow being that my Battery in installed in a small space in my trunk. I said screw that, and bought their red-top and it works and fits flawlessly! Now for the Amigo, a little more heavy duty red-top was recomended. On my 2nd installation and just under 3 years the Battery Failed. Would not hold a charge. Warranty is for 3 years. Now listen up: Their Customer Service, Optima whom I purchased Direct from (later I purchased from Amazon) acted like I did not have a problem. Sent me a long questionaire and told me to get a professional inspection. They acted like nothing can ever go wrong with their battery! I argued back and forth for a week and finally after a Letter to Corporate, they sent me a New Replacement Battery but also made me return the old one and then told me because it was a Replacement they can not offer a Warranty!<br /><br />I have to say this in retrospect of my experience; &#34;When the Battery functions yes, it may be the best on the auto/marine market in the USA but if it does fail, you have to fight them to get a replacement if you are still under warranty. I hated the idea of the long-wait for the new Battery and then having to pack the old battery and have FEDEX pick it up. So buyer beware. Also be aware the Battery is actually made in Mexico and can be sent through the mail.<br /><br />As far as the Battery itself, no complaints!
B00DQJA5XO|4|Looks good.  Occasionally, reception is affected.
B003EP52BU|4|Does the job okay, I just wish there were more of it.  My VW Passat has 4 doors, & this Sill Guard tape roll was only enough for 3 of the door sills.  The product works fine, but was a bit costly for what it was & should have given me enough for all 4 door sills - hence, the 4 star rating, instead of 5.
B007QBR5TA|4|This part fit my 1999 GMC Sierra 1500 5.3 vortex V8. I followed an video off of Youtube and the replacement was pretty easy, getting the serpentine belt back on was the only challenge. It wouldn't hurt to have another set of hands for that.The part was in good shape when I got it.
B001DRG7DS|2|They may be decent rotors, but they do not fit my 2007 B4000. Amazon stated that would fit my vehicle, but they don't. Alway double check sizes.
B00KIYGYN0|5|Works great
B00CASDZKC|5|The Mats are great they really help protecting the back of the seat and made out of material that can be cleaned easily
B0026M5RVC|4|the best. i replcaced de old one an it werked weely good. Cheers. en da bess to come lateraftter user
B001EZACH6|5|Installed in 15 minutes on my 2009 Scion xb (even quicker with 2 people).<br />Threw a Thule bike rack on (1/4&#34; receiver), and I was off to the trails.<br />Designed well, and fits with ease.
B000WJEPCI|5|I purchased this item for a few reasons. 1) To use the ac inverter to power my fishing lights 2) To use the compressor to air up my wifes bycycle tires, and last but not least 3) To use as a jump starter if needed. I am very satisfied withe the product and the price, along with the speedy service.<br />Thank You<br />Joe Shimchick
B0007N5758|5|Great brush for hands and fingernails.
B00ANR0L36|5|I have ordered these two times for our RI EZ pass as the Mass ones are a different size. This one holds the new style EZ pass * is a lot easier to remove it from the holder that the old style holder with two suction cups.<br />Have ordered 4 sets so far for my family.
B000OUZB8C|5|I collect classic cars, and in their restoration process you find broken and rotten grommets everywhere. This package helps you fix that problem by adding the correct grommets where needed.
B000WMHEBE|1|No featured meet higher fuel efficiency and the price is high time exajeradamente life if Was within expectations. I prefer to use dense long life I went cheaper and with 50,000 miles of use. -
B000CAM1QY|4|This product is mostly as expected. However, I could not find a size in the description, and it turned out to be too large to fit my steering wheel (size 14.5-16.5 inches). I would love to find it in a smaller size (14in).
B0068FM5W2|5|Bought this because my hands are more hams than hands.  installed on my helmet in about thirty seconds and now it is a piece of cake to don my helmet.  Would recommend this product to anyone who hates to thread the buckle. It also will give you a little extra strap for those helmets with just enough strap by extending it slightly.
B001HLHVN0|5|Very pretty and fancy for a litter bag.  It is exactly like the picture and matches the tan interior and the light green exterior of my car.  It is kind of small and does not hold a lot of trash so probably would not work if kids travel in your car.  But is perfect for me and I really like it.
B000QFN3DU|4|Sucessfully used to reduce heat from the exhaust to aluminum motorcycle side cases (older style Jesse Boxes on an 1150 GS). So far so good. It's been a dry month, and the tape is still in place. The case gets hot, but I'm not worried about the contents getting damaged.
B009PIKC4C|5|Great
B00SWW530A|5|great product ,works and looks great, very fast shipping ,very satisfied
B004A34G94|5|this was a perfect replacement for the WF8955.  easy installation and works great!  shipped very quick.  Amazing!
B0016KABFC|5|worked great for me.
B004GODT6S|3|And, it will probably last a long time.  A couple of things that might not matter to anyone but me.... some of the vertical bars were misaligned ... and worst, the mounting system is bogus.  It's apparent to me that the unit was designed and manufactured without ever trying to install it.  Perhaps it was designed and installed with the bumper cover on the work bench.  The slightest design change of the mounting bracket and the inclusion of a few u-clips would have had marginal impact on cost and made the install more pleasant.  A few hours out of what's left of a life that's already logged 73 years seems a lot to me.  your neighbor, ron :-(
B00469L32A|5|Not much to say about these other than they work really well. For the price they are a good bargain, they'll last longer than you think but they will eventually wear out.  Don't bother with the short handled version unless you are cleaning motorcycle wheels.    Combine these with a quality wheel cleaner like Griot's, Meg's Gold Class, etc and you'll make short work of keeping your wheels their proper color instead of brake-dust-brown.     Pros- price, effectiveness, quality.  Cons- they won't clean your wheels for you.
B005JU61D6|3|I bought these wipers because I had a set on my old SUE and loved them. Not so much on my new car. These wipers are much longer, maybe too long because they go off the windshield on both sides at the top, makes a loud flapping noise every swipe. Annoying!!! They also don't seem to be as effective being so long. I did go by what the manufacturer recommended for my Ford Fusion 2013. They just seem too long!
B007Y0CYN0|5|Meets our needs, love it
B00D4CL17W|1|poorly fit/ do not specify fitting for steering column
B0070Y341G|5|LED license plate bulb WORK AS IT STATE IN THE DESCRIPTION. Very satisfy with the purchase
B000JZGLN6|5|damn good
B0010GCYES|5|It was a perfect fit for my 2003 Chevy Trailblazer. It went in with  no problem in about 1/2 hour.
B007DIDLQW|5|Bought two of these: one for my friend and one for me. Way cooler than the family stick figure decals out there.
B001RME9AW|5|Is what it is
B000CSXMLO|5|There wasn't much info on this, but it looked like a match. Lucky for me it fit perfectly on the A/C compressor on my 1979 Ford Fiesta.
B009H7AXZO|1|I normally do not have any troubles with Caltric products but the the weld on the threaded stud broke when tightening.  Making the solenoid junk.  Not sure if I will try another one
B00HFWYZO8|5|Worked perfectly for my Navigator.  Good price and is saving the floors in my vehicle from the slosh of winter melting away.
B001IGE6ZK|3|They're more like 6&#34; mini bungees.  Honestly I mistakenly ordered these, but I'm not even sure for what I would use them.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great product! Bright and sturdy! Liked the first set so much, ordered another set! Fast, quality, as advertised.
B009K4H42Y|1|Did not receive A01 filter. Got a A02 filter, I will still be using them but keep that in mind when purchasing.
B001DN1L6K|5|Gt to me fast. Works awsome. Picks up great.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|Does what it's intended to do.  Handles the weight well, hasn't broke yet after months of use.
B00062ZSCC|5|This product works perfectly into my C280!!! We immediately noticed the difference after replacing the filter and our vehicle runs better now.  Happy with the purchase, I just wished price is a bit lower than my auto parts where I live:-)
B001AVW0B0|5|This bolted up with only one issue. The bolts that are stock on the rear sprocket (Yamaha TW200) are a tad too long. To fix this I added a lock washer to each of the nuts and moved the stock washer to outboard side of the bolt. Worked flawlessly and now I have the reassurance that the bolts won't back out. I would recommend this to any other owners looking to increase their top speed (little cc bikes like the tw200). The amazon \\"Will it fit\\" guide says that it won't fit on my 2012, but it did. Thanks! Wish I could give this a 10 star!
B007ITMF7M|4|Didn't really like any of the back rests available for this bike.  I don't feel the stryker was designed for passengers.  In any case, sometimes the wife needs to come with me on the bike, and I have to say that this looks a lot better in person than it does in the pictures, so that's a plus.  I don't like how the attachment bolts stick out from the fender when you have it removed.  I kind of wish I spent a $100 less and got the fixed version that takes less than 5 mins to remove and install 4 bolts, but whatever, the quick release option is convenient I have to admit.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that it doesn't come with the pad.  I knew that before I bought it, but it's just typical after market acessory bleeding out another $100 that you have to spend for this thing to be functional.  I find the picture to be dishonest showing both the pad and the rack, both of which are not included and will cost you more than $200 extra.<br /><br />The powder coating was a professional job and the installation is of course super easy.
B001PNMBE4|5|I, the retired SAAB only auto mechanic, bought a new winch for my ATV.  I hooked up the last wire, the one to the battery and ZAP!  Burned out the two relays in a very short second.  I have no idea why I wired it back-wards but I did.   The weather here on the Western Slope of Colorado was clear as a bell but I knew it was a matter of time before we would have another snow.   I went to Amazon.com and found just the correct relay with 3/8 inch connectors. I sent in my order for two relays. Most relay come with 1/4 inch connectors.  I spent the extra bucks for two day delivery. The relays arrived during a snow storm and I set to work installing the control box with the new relays and wired correctly.  They worked perfectly and I got the plowing done just in time for a house full of Christmas Party Friends.  Thanks to [[ASIN:B001PNMBE4 High Power 80 Amp Relay Single Pole, Double Throw].
B002WJ1XHQ|4|This plate frame, for the price, was worth it. It's not high quality by any means, and looks a bit cheap if you look too closely at it, but if someone is sitting in their car at a stoplight behind me, it looks cool. I have had it on my vehicle for several months now, and it has held up really well. Also, it doesn't obstruct any of the lettering on my personalized license plate like so many frames do. Skulls rule!
B0095GK9SI|4|Looks great on the Jeep.  Fitment is great.  The only thing that I don't like is the way that it fastens, I feel that a nice clean screw would hold just a bit better.  But overall I am satisfied with the product.
B008FZCXC0|5|Excellent
B004YWPELA|5|Bulbs arrived quickly and work as described. Only have them for a few months so I don't know how long they'll last, but all is great up to this point. Also, because I'm no automotive expert, I had some questions regarding this product, and called the manufacturer directly - they actually picked up the phone and were very helpful.
B00KMLV394|5|Perfect fit, look great!
B00063YM3W|5|Am building a scooter (power board / with seat) from parts I have come across.  In the process I had to change the final gear ratio which meant pulling some gears and re-installing new ones.  This totally fit my needs extremely well.  More than I expected.  I don't hesitate to recommend it to any one in the same position.  As always, love, Dennis
B000VUEDKM|5|after replacing my sealed beam headlights with HELLA 002395071 7&#34; H4 Type Single High/Low Beam Headlamp with Position Lamp, I used these bulbs in the headlights.  Prior to this, the sealed beams were very dull and I had difficult time seeing while driving even with High beams.  Now the low beam works well and it casts a great white light, not yellow as I had before.  The Highs are also very bright without being too bright to blind oncoming traffic.  The key is taking time to ensure the new headlight was installed correctly and aligning them properly.  I am very pleased with this and have recommended to all my Jeep friends, even those with JKs.  These work!
B0015PKOCI|5|I purchased this to use on line nuts for Diesel injector high pressure lines. Worked like a champ. Only minor complaint is the plastic behind one crowfoot broke out and the tool fell under the holder, i thought it was lost... nice fit and finish.
B000CQFWLY|5|This gadget is easy to install and operate. Before I found it online, I had to use a wrench to connect and disconnect the battery cable to keep the battery from running down between starts. (I'm using this on an old truck that I don't drive much.) It's nice to have a simple solution that works.
B006OSYQTI|5|What an awesome deal for a modular helmet. I have searched up and down the west coast of Florida for a blue modular helmet for even close to this price and had no luck at all.<br />Helmet is nice color and very light for an inexpensive helmet. A little noisy, but some ear plugs work just fine.<br />Blue Tooth ready refers to the ear pieces inside that are perforated to install ear buds. For the price it is an awesome deal and I have purchased another one in Pink, for my daughter (My most precious thing in the world to me)<br />Thanks so much!!
B0076M8TVM|4|When i received the packaged the top and the thing you press on to spray was apart. other than that its a 5 star
B00MGI60RQ|5|Great product and even better price. I replaced interior and license plate lights on 3 vehicles. These lights rock, have bright blue color compared to dingy yellow standard bulb.
B00NSA37UO|5|Went on easily and looks great! Note: Human error is an easy occurrence so be careful. Once it touches the window it sticks and it hard to move so make sure you start at the position you want. Also try to avoid installation when it is windy (wasn't one of my brightest ideas but I really wanted it on!) and take it slow. Other then my own stupidity making it more challenging then it had to be the product is great and arrived fast. Would definitely buy from them again. :)
B007TXKZYC|1|I suppose the product I received could have been a cheap knockoff of an actually superior product, but allow me to review what I was given.<br /><br />I have a 2010 Chevy Aveo Hatchback LS and I've got to say, these don't fit my car's seats at all, but after trying to install them, I don't know what kind of seats these *would* fit. What I dislike is the fact that the extremely brief instructions don't match up with the equipment on the seat covers (e.g. &#34;Hook the elastic strap to the grommets&#34; when there are no grommets on any part of any piece included), but I guess that's typical of a knockoff product.<br /><br />After finagling the elastic straps to the best of my ability and accidentally ripping off one of the webbing straps with very little effort, the seat covers are still extremely loose or in some places, not connected at all. I don't know how common it is to have a back seat that lifts up so you can thread elastic straps underneath, but my car doesn't have that all-too-necessary feature for the back seat covers to be secured. It doesn't even mention how to secure the headrest covers, but the intended design just seems to be to tie them on via the loose elastic straps.<br /><br />Walking by the car, it actually looks decent--it's anything but. I'm not going to lie, I still have these hanging out draped over my car seats, but not because I'm happy with the product. $50 isn't a small investment to me, so I'm going to put these to use if I can.<br /><br />The funny thing is that on the package it says &#34;Superior Product&#34;
B000IOO4KK|1|The packaging claims this is a 6-amp switch, but it smoked and melted after about 20 minutes on a 55-watt headlamp load (at 14 volts that's 4 amps). Problem is that the wires are tiny, so there's too much resistance at the terminals, at both ends. I got smoke from inside the switch and from the crimped terminal at the end of the low-beam wire. If you run a big headlamp on this switch you'll also need to wire in a couple of relays to handle the current.
B005M1R5UA|5|Anti-seize has always been necessary; with aluminum heads being so common, it's essential.  It serves two purposes:  lubricates the plug going in so that torque settings are accurate, and prevents, well, seizing when the plugs need to come out later.<br /><br />I don't change plugs all that often, so it's tempting to buy the $1 packet of anti-seize at the auto parts store, but I don't.  I know about the quality of this, the packets are iffy.  I don't want to have to worry what's going to happen in 3-5 years when I have to go back in.  I want the plugs to come out.  And they do.<br /><br />You only use a little, so there's a lot left over.  Close the tube carefully, put it in a baggie, and it will last a long time.  My problem is finding it the next time I need it!  My solution was to get a small toolbox that will just hold my spark plug sockets.  I put it all together and set it aside.<br /><br />Compared to your time and the potential for damaged cylinder heads, this stuff is cheap.  Buy it.
B0031XYAUE|5|Easy install.
B006O87VFO|4|noticed an slight increase in mpg, reusable is a good thing.
B000M5Y720|5|Good stuff but i already know that and you all should too....its not HID but its bright and makes night driving safer
B000CQ21CM|5|It worked exactly like I expected to, one thing that I'd of loved to be added to it though would be a bit of anti sieze. The heads on the modular engines are aluminum and the 304 stainless will weld in place if it is not used. However, for the price I am going to be doing this on all my modulars..
B00DQJ8T00|1|Reception was bad .......and my channel scan didn't work ...bad choice ...looks great though
B0065UN98Y|5|GREAT DEAL!
B0073XTN14|5|I choose 5 stars b/c the original antenna I believe it just rotted off - the car was driven for years like this and the radio still worked just fine.  I WAS going to finally get one to match the original but when I saw this cool little thing I figured why not give the Toyota a little TLC and update.  Was a snap to install - really easy.  Looks clean and great on car.  I may consider a touch of super glue on the threads of the screw  just b/c it looks so cool I'm afraid someone will try to steal it and I never plan to remove it anyway - I figure the super glue will just make it a little harder for thieves to take it off.  But yeah most any antenna like the ones on a Toyota 2005 Corolla  can be easily removed. No fault of this product of course.  Def would recommend.
B00JH2GLBY|5|Product was shipped timely, was of excellent value and more than met my expectations.
B001FIDNGO|4|I needed replacement button to keep the seatbelt buckle from dropping to the floor.  This is great, just like the original.
B00JAN4P3Q|4|Good quality for the price. They are thick and can be cut down to size. Only down side is that they have a very strong odour.
B002OQ0F0I|4|Fits good and works fine
B003LS768M|3|it does not stay in place and bunches up when you sit down.  not at all what I expected.  cheaper and better quality at walmart
B000GV9O3C|5|My fiance has a 2002 Roadstar Warrior 1700 and we purchased this sissy bar along with a Mustang seat. It matches perfectly.  I absolutely love it.  It is so comfortable.
B00495UQT2|5|Installed in a 70 Jeepster Commando.  Works very well.
B007ZDDUCK|5|Bought this to bring new life to a couple of my wife's purses. It did a great job adding moisture and rejuvenating the leather. Used it on a jacket of mine and it turned out great.
B00ES2EAFC|5|I requested these custom for my vehicle and 2 Loose Screws came through in flying colors! They look AWESOME and I've had a TON of comments already. You guys rock! Thanks!
B00IFDISAS|5|shirts were very very nice. gave them as a gift, recipient loved them. items were described accurately and were shipped/received in a very timely fashion. internet shopping the way it is supposed to be!!!!!
B007AKA7ME|1|Wasn't like the orignal visor that came with my hjc helmet or the ones I seen at cycle gear soooo I'm guessing it's not a genuine hjc visor, it does the job but feels differnt,
B00415BSFQ|1|Received this item, plugged it into the car, and it didn't work.  Nothing.  It's a piece of junk.  I would never buy this again.  Yes it a low cost item, but it's a waste of money and time to deal with.
B0010VO8PQ|4|These lights, all things considered, offer a great value. For less than a hundred bucks you get a complete kit with everything needed to mount them to just about any vehicle. There are, however, some pretty big issues that should be addressed.<br /><br />First, the relay and wiring harnesses are NOT suitable for anything but 55w halogens and even then, you're really pushing your luck. Ideally, for 55w bulbs, you would have 14AWG wires and for 100W-130W bulbs, 12AWG wires. I'm not sure what size comes with the kit, but they're definitely way too small. They're also not copper core wire; maybe zinc plated something or another? Regardless, they're not copper. If you do decide to use the included wiring, be VERY careful as it is quite fragile and the insulation tears easily.<br /><br />I had the best luck by throwing away all of the wires that came with the lights and running 12AWG wire directly from the battery and into the light and to the bulb. I also threw away the included relay and purchased a 30/40A 4 pin relay from RadioShack. Running 100W or even 130W halogen bulbs is no problem. The relay gets slightly warm but the wires are cool to the touch.<br /><br />The beam produced is OK but I feel like it could definitely be better. Can't really complain for the price, though. It's not a pencil beam nor is it a flood beam - it's a &#34;driving beam&#34; which is supposed to offer a mix between spill (flood) and throw (distance).
B005MJ81LO|5|Exactly what we were expecting, worked great!
B00UUDZGMO|4|The switch is supposed to shine red when it is activated, but it doesn't.  I wired it the same way I wired an identical switch; that one worked, this one didn't.
B0027ZSODG|5|good sticker. Letters are hard to apply because they stick to the paper too much
B00PT18QAQ|5|I recently purchased a Tire Tek Pressure Gauge from Odysea Co. One of your supplier, and wanted you to know, that I was pleased<br />with the quality of the product, and timely manner in which it was received. They do a great job for you!
B006RKG8ZS|4|It is a good product there are small imperfections here and there but hey for the price you cannot beat it in trust me 4 inches high people do not miss it I would definitely recommend this to purchase
B0002KR88A|5|Works great!
B00KDRXDFY|2|I had a white one just like this and I loved it. But my new car has tinted windows and I thought a black one would look nice just like the black one in the picture shown (though I honestly should probably have known better). Unfortunately, I can barely see mine and my windows aren't quite as dark as the car in the picture. I was a bit disappointed...
B001Y93RKQ|5|One of the rims fell off our Camry and we could never find one that matched the others online or from Toyota (weird) so I figured I would give these a shot and they are perfect. Super easy to assemble and put on. I noticed a lot of people claim this didn't fit their rim but I honestly think either 1. you didn't order the right ones for your specific vehicle and 2. you don't know how to properly put on a rim. (especially the ladies who complained) Anyways, perfect fit and they look great! Much better than the originals. Will order again!
B000BTLHN4|5|INSTALLATION IS NO FUN....IT'S HEAVY STEEL AFTER ALL....<br />SUPER HEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION....LOVE IT....!!!!
B006KBLEJO|5|Fits with no issues and it is much thicker than the stock filter, feels higher quality.<br />Did this change the intake sound and or performance? No it is just a nice air filter that I can re-use without having to keep paying the $20 for a Subaru paper filter.<br />Did this make flames shoot out of the tailpipe like it shows on the box? Unfortunately. . . No.
B000WJKKPE|5|fits exactly like the original. absolutely loved it
B000ET9SAU|1|Over the years I have worn out a few DC pumps and this one did not last a year. All the ones that I had in the past were cheaper and lasted longer(years)! I will not be buying any Slime product in the future...
B003U4O414|5|I dumped this product in my 5 qt oil pan small block chevy and during the first cruise I could feel it lowering the frictional drag within the engine. Quicker revs, more power, less heat and im sure longer engine life
B004Y9YJ0A|1|Junk
B003G9SDOW|3|I like the remote feature but really didn't need it. A switch would have worked just fine. The kit was complete and they are good short to medium range lights. I am familiar with Warn products and was a little disappointed to see all plastic housings. I guess I expected a little more from Warn products. I guess time will tell how the plastic hold up to Florida sun and heat.
B0053ZOZY4|5|i love theses
B001CAB8LC|5|Worked like a charm on my 2010 Focus.  Got 90k miles out of the original belt before it started to squeak.  Spend the extra money for the OEM belt.<br /><br />To install, put the front tires on ramps, remove the two bolts on the plastic belt cover from underneath the car(the cover hides the belt from underneath), remove the tension on the belt by using a socket and ratchet on the hex head on the casting on the tensioner.  The tensioner is on the bottom back side of the engine.  Make sure you print out or take pictures of the routing before you remove the belt.<br /><br />I think it took me about 30 minutes total.
B001FZNIL2|5|I purchased this without thinking. I got what I payed for though. I thought it would be a heavy nylon tail gate instead its more like vinyl very light material. It fits though and I can't complain for the price and quick delivery.
B004K25IGK|5|I have bought two pairs of the handles. I have one pair that hangs off the head rest and a pair that is on the roll bar both sets are easy to install.
B00FBPQK7Q|5|All good
B00749RRUQ|5|This override did exactly what it is supposed to do and it's very easy to install. The seller also has very fast response time via email, would reccomend to everyone
B002INTDSM|5|I wouldn't pay much for something you're smashing in between something with a large metal hammer.  That being said, this is strong enough to take the beating, cheap enough to make it worth it.  5/5 in my book, already used it a few times.
B00JSBQGY6|4|nice.
B000JKMTDM|5|Excellent meter
B004LY08VM|5|GREAT PRODUCT!  One bottle did 6 patio chair cushions front and back.  The rain now beads and rolls off!  I found that it does not need heavy saturation, spray just enough to dampen the fabric (I used the spray setting).  I am VERY impressed and plan on using on camping gear next!
B007OWAKR0|4|Well designed and well made. Appears that it will last a long time with no rust. Only problem is that it is rather pricey for what it is.
B000JJMQCC|3|Good protection
B004TR8728|5|Very sturdy construction and worked as advertised. No longer resetting chock blocks that become loose.<br />Planning on ordering another one soon.
B00DR1T75S|5|A good size for my rear window. It does not interfere with my ability to safely drive. It also looks really cool on dark tinted glass!
B002EOVDII|1|Bought this item, plugged it in and the IPhone beeped and said that this device did not support charging. I have tried it several times and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work. That's not good enough for me, my wife has to commute 70 miles everyday and having a dependable charger is important. I took a chance and I guess I lost, so much for this piece of junk!
B0041LK662|4|Good fit except for the rear window deflector clips.  They are a PITA to try to install them first.  The manufacturers (WeatherTech) customer service  was non-existent.  First I emailed them, after three days no response I'm still waiting.  I then called them and spoke with a customer service representative who had no knowledge about the product, and could only refer me to an authorized dealer to install the clips.  So if you are putting these on a Prius, do not peel the adhesive cover on the ends, put them in without the clips for 12 hours, lock the windows so no one opens the windows, then after the time period, remove them, then install the clips, The instructions offered by the manufacturer are not too clear, but use the tool they supply you with and pull the internal weather-stripping side that the back of the window pane touches, it will open down like a flap.  Insert the clip curved end away from the vehicle flat top end inside the channel and the back weather-strip open side flap closed again over the clips straight side facing the vehicle.  Peel the adhesive backing covers on the ends  and then gentle work the deflector into the channel and over the clips.  Just take your time, look over the instructions a number of times. The manufacturer should be move clear and offer vehicle specific instructional images with the instructions supplied.  Weather strips on vehicles are as different as the vehicle they are installed in.
B0077FIWU6|5|great
B001DXBZH0|1|Don't misunderstand, there was nothing wrong with the product itself. The only problem was that the ad did not illustrate what exactly this product would fit.<br />I would expect something like this...<br /> 19** to 19** Chevrolet Monte Carlo Lumina.....<br />with center console shift...<br /><br />Hey jack that's what I needed not a column shift option which is too short.
B001BK4A1S|5|Great item quick shipping but was wrong electric cable for my truck. the mirror was constructed very well at a good price.
B001MXM8Q8|5|Anything that have to do with Jack is my favorite. I love Jack he's my everything I even have a tattoo of him and Sally of course.
B000XH82O6|5|its a rain x , what more can I say,its good quality,it lasts,it fits,it does its job & very easy to install
B005JU5WI6|5|I have used the Bosch Icon 28&#34; and 17&#34; on my 2009 Altima for 3 years. When it became time for them to be replaced, I tried the Trico Force, but they were horrible, made a lot of noise and chattered on the glass. I then tried PIAA since I have them installed on my mom's Camry, but they so not properly fit against the glass on the drivers side.<br /><br />So I ended up returning back to the Bosch Icon. I got them in today and installed. Cleans well, quiet, and no chattering. When the time comes to replace them again in a few years, I'll stick with Bosch. But I do wish they made a Silicon version like PIAA.
B007GB6Z1Y|1|expected it to be bigger
B00068XCQU|5|This is the second one that I purchased. Now there is one for each of the two vehicle that I own so the charger doesn't have to moved.
B000AS3D3S|5|Traditional Motorcraft quality. Have used these filters for years.
B000VKRQ8S|5|A+++++ thanks
B007Q3HCL4|5|Exceptional tools
B0001L0DFA|4|awesome for the price. doesn't have a very big spray, like the cone water doesn't open as much as I thought it would, but the stream setting on it is intense, depending on your pressure you can squirt 50 feet
B000RPG0DO|5|I had a bad leak in my jeep for years to the point where the thing smelled moldy.  I had to do something quick because I was having another baby and didn't want the poor thing to get sick from the mold... so I removed all the carpet and bedlined the tub.  Well, that got rid of the mold, but I had a new problem... heat.  The heat from the jeep would radiate up from the cat and muffler into the passenger area to the point where you could fry an egg on the metal.  I installed this roll and it made things a lot more bearable.  It is still hot, but similar to stock carpeting and insulation.  You will probably need two rolls to do a jeep cherokee front and rear passengers properly (I was not proper).
B008ECCBFS|4|Despite the lack of color options, this handle was just what I was looking for. It took me less than 30 min. to take the broken one out and replace it with the new one. Pretty painless fix.
B002OR2FIW|5|Big improvement on my existing converter in my 2002 Roadtrek 200 Popular.
B0052UMJAW|5|This product was received faster than anticipated and took about 45 seconds to program. Programing instructions were so simple to follow and do. VERY satisfied and would recommend to anybody. will DEFF do business with them again.
B00DP5D51I|4|Would of been 5 stars if came with more mixing larger mixing cups. Otherwise very good
B007R9SSU6|5|Mine actually came with a 'ID-12LA' RFID reader instead of just the 'ID-12' reader in the picture, which is better for me.<br /><br />I also bought [[ASIN:B0090C105S 10PCS RFID 125Khz Proximity ID Token Key Tag Keyfob Chain]] and those key chain fobs read fine with this device.<br /><br />I'm just using it with a Windows PC for testing out some stuff. Everything you need to get started is included in this kit. You simply plug it in via USB and it will be detected as a new COM port with built-in Windows drivers. Launch some terminal program like Hyper Terminal (part of Windows XP and below) or Putty (free online), connect to the COM port, and then scan an item and you'll see the ID appear in the terminal window on your computer. The device will also make a beep sound for every successful read. The range is about 1 inch.
B005RGGP24|2|The Dome light works, but the map light up front is the wrong type of bulb completely.  I purchased this before tearing the covers off my car so I didn't know what the bulbs looked like, my mistake I guess, but the description says it works on 02-12 model toyota corollas... so that information is incorrect.<br /><br />I'm only giving it 2-stars because the dome light worked, otherwise it would be 1 star.
B0041CBUKC|1|Bristles to hard
B009CCM6CC|3|I didn't price this item against the OE/ACDelco version. This item was return because the backlighting was a hard blue color, not the bluish white of the original dash. It was very noticeable.
B007VHPB90|5|OEM the best!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This fit very nicely in my FR-S. There are reports of the FR-S/BRZ dashboards peeling up from the sun and I wanted to avoid that. This lowered the internal temp of my car considerably and I don't have to fear my dashboard melting anymore. It is very light and flexible.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that I cannot figure out how to get it back into the bag it came in. That's alright tho, I just toss it in the trunk.
B003SG2JEI|5|My husband loved this great qualiy and looks awesome on the garage wall. Quality material and very nice size looks great
B00PZ66NUK|2|Think its cheaply made for the price . I hope the sun doesn't fade it.
B002EOZG8G|5|This fit my 2012 Dodge Ram 1500 Crew cab perfectly.  Arrived in perfect condition in only a couple days and installation was pretty easy.
B000SPPW14|5|Was really surprised at the perfect fit being that my bike is a hardtail so its a bit longer and shorter but this cover fit perfectly plus has the tie straps witch I wasnt aware of until used. Thumbs up as far as Im concerned.
B005CLLNM6|5|Pleased!!
B00EN7JPIO|5|Excelente producto... recomendado 100%
B00CASDZKC|3|The mats are currently working fine. They didn't fit on my Rav4 seats well; I had to stretch the elastic to it's max to make it fit, but so far so good.
B000COBLKW|5|I can definitely tell the difference in brightness even in the daytime, I feel safer on my bike and it gave me better visability at night. Just get the ceramic plugs so you don't chance accidentally melting your factory plug!
B000KZ1WL6|1|The headlight switch was the wrong one<br />I just didnt know where to send it bsvk had no return addess
B00D98CX1Y|5|Look great go on easy and haven't budged.  Wished they made some a touch larger but what're ya gonna do?
B00J2CI1UI|5|GOOD
B008SCWXN4|5|A friend and I were able to confirm that this tool work with a 2015 WRX.  I know I couldn't find much information regarding that models compatibility after doing a lot of searching on the internet so I thought I'd post it here for those that were in doubt.  The working system configuration was a Windows 7 64 bit PC.  You'll need to download the ATEQ software from the support webpage.  Then make sure you have internet connection to allow the application to update its database.  Most importantly, select the 2014 Impreza model!  I talked with an ATEQ rep. and they're going to update their database for the '15 WRX using the same protocol as the '14 Impreza, which will be delivered in a future update.  Until then make sure to follow my recommendations.  We were able to download and push codes into the car's on-board system.  Hope this helped :-)
B0097LOHU2|5|Sized correct, solid construction, nice material. Other than that, not much to say. Time to play with fire!!! (Sorry mom..)
B002MYLB1Y|5|Perfect addition to my tie down system
B00W31VMYC|1|I have a 1997 Isuzu trooper and ordered this particular reader online because the seller stated it was compatible with my vehicle.<br />Connectivity: the Bluetooth connects perfectly to the S4 however the reader could not communicate with the vehicle via all the available protocols and using multiple applications.<br />Windows Software: Piracy, using key generators (which is why the user receives Virus Alerts).<br />Cost: The original price is acceptable only if the device works, however, and in my case, it costed me about USD 25 since I ship all my orders to Lebanon (Middle East) via a fast courier service.<br />Bottom Line: Do not waste your time and your money.
B0007XTGCI|4|This purchase was for my second set of these. They are sturdy, and well made. Mine came missing the bolts that hold the base to the upright. I called Torin, and they promptly sent me replacements, but it took some pushing and shoving on my part to get them to do it.
B008H3YIKU|5|works well in my club car.
B000GTJ5I8|5|Used on the front springs of a 1992 V8 Ford Mustang Convertible.  Getting stock springs in and out with this compressor is a cake walk.  It's pricey but well worth it.
B000C5WCV8|5|This product, as with most Denso products, is practically the Toyota OEM replacement sensor for a tiny fraction of the dealer price. Be careful however, and take a close look under your hood before buying this. Some Toyota models use an A/F sensor instead of oxygen sensor, and that is Denso part no 234-9010. The connectors are different as well, and that is evident from the pictures provided by Amazon for this part. Denso included plenty of anti-seize, and this part was a cinch to install as expected otherwise.
B004U3ORCK|5|This is a wonderful keychain for any Mercedes-Benz lover or enthusiast. I bought it for my car and it looks so sharp, I am surprised it was so inexpensive. I am very, very well pleased. I would hightly recommend. Would be nicer if it was a little heavier, but I can manage. The color is a brilliant silver/chrome. Lovely item.
B00HYM8HNO|5|the inside now at night looks awesome...thank you for handling my concern with great costumer service..although the trunk lights were a little longer than the originals..I bent the holding clip to hold them in
B004BSCVAO|5|Just need to add a can to my a/c system as I'm too cheap to pay a professional to find and repair the leak.
B002LTDR26|5|This products worked very well.  We are very happy with the result.  A little bit pricey,  we would buy it again if the price is a little more affordable
B004M0U6DU|5|Works great. Weighted base makes it very sturdy.
B000CQRLWC|5|Fantastic stopping...no fad under severe or extreme braking. Some black dust is expected but easily cleaned up. Highly recommended for towing and emergency response.
B000LUBQ4S|5|Not much to say that it's a great brand name battery with a great price for the amps. Kinetik is the top of the line for racing and car stereo batteries. It is half the size as a normal battery, which is surprising, because I thought it would be a full size battery, nice...
B003ZAGI9E|5|the ramps work really well as I have several cars I work on at home that are low profile cars. no issues at all pulling on to these ramps. only issue that you may consider is they are large and take up a lot of garage space. would recommend these and buy them again.
B004JVCKU4|5|Easy to install and works great
B009X1XDZG|4|good price an shipping time. Will continue to buy to have spares
B001D48E8C|5|This is a very sturdy and quality product. It was very easy to install. the profile gives my new Pilot a great finished look.
B008M1UBGC|5|These floor liners fit my truck perfectly. I got front and back sets and have no problem hopping in with dirty boots and knowing that my floors are protected and the liners are easily cleaned up.
B00267PZUK|5|Works as advertised. Ending up breaking 5 of 8 plugs and this beauty removed them with ease! With this tool, there's no need to be afraid to tackle this project. It's a small investment that can save you hundreds if you're considering changing the plugs with a mechanic. It's an item that you hope you don't have to use, but if you do you'll be very glad you made the purchase.
B0007O09MI|5|This cover fit my friend's steering wheel perfectly (Taurus auto).   I received it within 36 hrs. of ordering.  Excellent customer service and packaging.
