B00P2D3VZG|5|Great bulbs pure white great quality.
B00FJDH45C|5|Good quality perfect fit
B000C57UEW|5|These progressive springs are great, my lowering springs were worn out and i was tired of scraping places so i went back to stock height. They soak up the bumps well and when you lean on them they hold up better than stockers do.
B000C2CJ5U|5|Still good after 2 years of use.
B00IJHWO0A|5|good exactly what was listed. Did not fit them yet but pretty much it looks excellent. keep you updated
B005H5XTRY|5|My gut likes this thing alot.
B000NOKNK0|1|cant wear glasses in it
B007D62G74|1|You do not need this piece!!! Look it up on the web. One can be made with (1) resistor and (1) capacitor found at radio shack for $2.00. Very easy to do!
B00CGTVCIC|5|GOOD QUALITY, BUT IT WAS NOT LEATHER.
B0006N5RW2|5|Covers the poop hole exactly as it should
B000C73NMI|1|It is not fit for 94-97 Honda Accord EX, one of the brake fluid line did not fit.
B004UTAAFW|5|I've had it for a year and it's still shiny.  How shiny is that?
B004OI2FO8|4|looks great, high quality.  one small complaint, be careful when tightening, if you have the screws torqued too much they will create a wave in the hood and you have to go back and readjust, which is not easy to get to behind the hood insulator.  Of course, this is really more of a result of the thin metal in the hood rather than an actual issue with the product.
B00080QHMM|5|It is ridiculously simple to use and gives a reasonable read-out.  My 2008 Xterra has a very sensitive tire pressure warning system, and this gauge lets me know exactly where the tires are in relation to range that requires attention.  Easily fits in the glovebox.
B000N9VF6Q|2|This item did not change anything to the flow of water on my pump. I would not recommend buying it.
B005BFKVA8|5|G12 coolant.  I am not a chemist so I can not make any statement about the quality of the coolant, but I enjoy the simplicity of ordering off of Amazon.
B00E5VXI5E|5|:)
B007KAXBBI|5|Love it!
B00EEG9D8Q|5|Attached easily and quickly. Good, sturdy quality.
B00J1TK1DM|5|Better than oem
B004PGLCMK|5|Exactly what I expected.
B004RCUW2I|5|Fit my 2004 Fleetwood Bayside folding camper with a Mach 3 AC. Was a easy fix with basic tools.
B006MX7ZRK|1|Very poorly made! As soon as we put the on they started to tear.
B00KJ8IW8A|4|Good product
B00D8DR0AO|5|This product leaves the car looking like it's been hand waxed. You will love it
B00QN92ZYG|2|Did not fit
B00DSNXLDO|5|These are just too fun not to put in your car. They smell nice, last for a good few months, and make you smile. :)
B008US97XA|4|These were just the ticket on my 04 Heritage, no need to cut wire to add on the correct connector for the passing LED passing lamps. The adapters are a tight fit inside the housing, must be careful not to pinch a wire.
B00BXS03DM|5|Fit, and mounted Harbor Freight winch with no new holes required.
B00VDQNELW|5|Nice addition to my new Jeep.  Makes the console a very comfortable elbow-rest ad well as protecting it from dirt and sun.
B00WXVX8AS|5|Received the item pretty fast looks great
B00CNI1SDA|5|This stuff works great on my work boots.
B00DSA450U|5|This is a sunscreen made of a silvery reflective material that looks like flattened bubblepack. It arrives stiff but will soften over time, like a padded envelope. It folds shut accordian style and has a cheap velcro strap to secure it.  The jumbo size is just right for my 2002 nissan maxima.  The butterfly image is pretty and colorful without being childish. Very happy.
B00KTIUQDO|5|I had to go to a locksmith to have them cut and programmed. The lock smith told me that 40-50% of the ones customers bring I don't work. These worked!! So happy with them
B00XFFRNE8|4|Just as described
B00KFIC3UW|5|Shipping was a little delayed, the controls look as good if not better than controls that are twice the price. Feels a little heavier than stock controls but style and function make for a great cheap upgrade; don't think I could of done better. Ducati Hypermotard 796 approved...
B00400IMZQ|1|Good overall design but cheaply made and quality Control sucks. Snorkel pulls loose from from Airbox when You mount And, there is no seal or way to secure it. I had to enlarge mounting holes in box then fabricate a way to keep snorkel from falling out. Wasn't happy for a multi hundred dollar purchase. Also the lid for the box has no stiffening features and as you tighten it warps and leaves gaps in the top for engine compartment air to leak in. I had to use double foam gasket on top and just barely tighten lid to get a good seal.
B005LVLVSI|5|Strong leather. Exactly like the picture.
B00M7P3CPQ|5|I love this cover. Works well and does not get grimy
B00NWF84HQ|5|great replacement for my factory remote, everything works fine.
B00ONDM07G|5|Very easy to install in my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Sahara.  Holds my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 phone confidently and allows for portrait or landscape position without any issues.  I can have the phone in place and still have room to store my sunglasses in the tray.  I've tried many different options for a phone mount in my Jeep.  This is by far the best.  Highly recommend.
B000C44CKS|5|Great shocks
B0053P69IO|5|This is a very solid hitch. I was able to install it myself on my 2006 Toyota sienna and a matter of minutes with a single socket wrench. The hitch itself is so low that it drags the ground, but that is going to the design of the sienna… Not a flaw of the product. It holds up amazingly well to the constant scraping on speed bumps.
B000Q754E4|4|It keeps everything very cool which is what I expected. I don't like how cheaply it is constructed. As a wish it had would be a thermostat.
B000GOHV48|5|Fit perfect and works great
B0012TLGG0|5|fast shipping bolt on but had to get a new carb after all
B003VFHSBK|5|We love the sun screen!! Sitting out is much cooler now that we have it. Very easy put up and take down.
B00ECJR7JC|5|AAAA+++
B008ONR90O|5|yes my son was very pleased with it. He received quickly
B00IK4CUHE|4|Just what I needed. Product was as described and easy to install.
B0002SQYC8|5|Good product!
B005OUUCVS|5|Works great in my car.
B00VR8NI1C|5|Hopefully I will never have to test the airbag feature!<br /><br />I've been riding for over 20 years. I took a long break from riding street bikes and recently started riding again. With all the new safety gear available, I was not sure which route to take. My primary safety concern has always been neck and spine injury. I looked at high end leather gear with full CE padding and possibly a LEATT brace OR an airbag jacket/vest. I did not think the neck brace was practical to use all the time *** just my personal preference *** I'm not saying the leather and brace setup is bad, but I chose to go with the Hit-Air jacket. I would recommend upgrading the armor included with the jacket - esp the back for additional protection. Also, note that this jacket isn't really meant for abrasion protection, so you will want to supplement this with a kevlar shirt.<br /><br />Fit is true to size - I went with a large and I am 5'10&#34; about 180 pounds.<br /><br />Build quality of this jacket is absolutely TOP rate. It is apparent to me that Hit-Air knows what they are doing! I will not ride without this jacket!!
B00RQS7QWY|1|I received them and they did not work
B0077A7U68|4|Easy to install
B00LGZYS10|3|It has to go on the outside of the window. It should be able to go inside to keep it out of snow and rain.
B00JRE6APE|5|Great lock, small and light (for what it is). Looks cool and is easy to use.
B001O08T1M|5|My truck is getting up there in age, so when I couldn't start it, hearing a &#34;click,&#34; after checking the battery, I ordered this starter with the possibility that the engine might just be frozen (it's got about 225,000 miles on it).  This starter seemed like a good deal and didn't take me out of my way to go pick one up from the auto-parts store.  When it arrived, I was pleased to read that it was brand new!  Another reviewer mentioned that but I didn't quite believe it because it didn't seem to match what the description said.  Anyway, it was identical to the original (from my '98 GMC Suburban) and there was a heat shield covering the solenoid which unsnapped from the old one and fit perfectly on this one.  After I changed it, wow!  It started right up, like never before.  I'm very happy and would order this again.  Glad I didn't spend more.
B00ZUXPICW|5|Very satisfied.
B00AOAFP9C|4|Pump works as advertised. The flow could be slightly quicker. Great value for the money and excellent customer service.
B00A4GTQLO|1|Didn't fit. Much too big for my 2015 Q7. If this is really a genuine Audi product, Audi is really slipping. Cheaply made and not worth the price.
B003LMJP4Q|5|good
B00K8E0WAG|5|Perfect size for my rv. Shipped quick!
B00CGCOO2U|4|Great!
B000RFUF12|5|What expected. Met expectations
B012FNABVC|4|[[VIDEOID:ac013376435ff79e1ec5b59f19346b30]] .<br />It has enough juice to start a medium-large car engine, no problem. (It started my 4.0 Liter V6.)<br /><br />I also use it inside my camper van as a 12-volt power supply for lighting and a fan. Works well (see below).<br /><br />There are over a dozen brands on amazon that are nearly identical to this model, so you can shop around. Those that look identical to this model may have minor differences in the carrying case, connectors provided, emergency light features, etc. The 4 \\"clones\\" I tested all seem to have come from the same factory because they have so many details in common.<br /><br />This model comes with a 4-way USB cable (Micro-, Mini-, Apple 30-pin, and Apple Lightning.) Very nice. Probably better than the ones that come with different USB tips for you to lose. The cable can charge more than one device at a time. The Lightning connector works fine...no errors or complaints with my iPhone 6.<br /><br />ZoZo has a similar [[ASIN:B00ZZW5HHE Auto EPS model]] that I like better (see Note 1).<br /><br />Li-Ion batteries don't like heat. I would definitely not keep this in my trunk. And even keeping it in your car could ruin the battery over time if you do a lot of outside parking in warm weather.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br /> - Works as described<br /> - It looks and feels like good quality<br /> - Nice quality 120-volt AC and 12-volt DC charging adapters<br /> - 4-way USB cable included<br /> - Nicely designed case<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br /> - Mine came with no user guide. Not sure why.<br /><br />NIT PICKs:<br /><br /> - The ON-OFF switch is a bit hard to operate.

It's the amp-hours delivered at 3.7 volts by the internal Li-ion cells before the conversion to higher voltage output. This unit's 16.8-amp hour spec means you would get a maximum of 5.18 amp-hours at 12-volts, for example. It's about 62 watt-hours of power, no matter which voltage output you're using.<br /><br />- - - Connector Sizes - - -<br /><br />It comes with lots of connector tips for 12-16-19 volt output, but it's nice the know the main unit uses very common connector sizes, in case you want to attach your own cables.

B00KULINTY|5|Fits perfect on my wife's 2003 Liberty.  Ordered 2, not realizing one set comes with all 4 pads.  Pads come with hardware kit (bushings sold separately).  Recommend changing the slide pin bushings, mine were seized causing the pads to wear differently.
B001LWN5SK|3|Very bulky. Little harder to use and/or remove for storage than I expected.  But does a good job covering and protecting vehicle.
B00IKXVGCA|5|I have a tinted hatch window, so it doesnt show up well, do you have other colors, I would to buy one like hot pink or orange or lime green would be great. other than that, I LOVE it!
B00DWS232U|5|Received on time, looked great, and is now on my 1999 GMC pickup.
B000NVW1LM|5|I have tried just about everything at the local automotive stores, with no luck.  IOne bottle of this and no more leaks.  The key is to ensure you are going to be driving the vehicle (a lot) after pouring it in.  Jeep Liberty Renegade would have a puddle every morning, forcing me to add oil once a day.  I believe the leak was coming from oil pan (common issues with the Liberty). After driving around 200-300 miles in 2 days, the leak has stopped.  Few weeks later and no leaks.  This is a must try.
B00NB8UY5Y|5|Works great. Nice and bright
B00HJ6O4A0|5|This mat has is nicely constructed and has great vivid colors.  It keeps sand and moisture from coming through but still breathes well.  Folds up nicely, holds together with velcro and has a carrying handle....very nice.
B0009JRVWC|5|Easy to install, looks good.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It fits my 2006 Scion xB beautifully. And considering that it's 104 degrees Fahrenheit in Texas right now, that speaks volumes. I can get into my car and not feel as though I might roast.  It collapses down into a manageable size and could fit easily into my door pockets, if I didn't already have them stuffed with CDs.
B00170MWB2|5|Fit perfect, works great
B000630AV0|5|Very close to originals
B000QUZ572|3|It's OK, but the OEM was thicker and easier to install for the RH side. The 'insert tabs' are hard to install.....one broke partly while installing. And I have been in the Auto Body work for 53 years.....! But it's OK......it will pass.<br /><br />Thom
B004W5TJME|2|very good......
B002XL2IEA|4|Looks nice
B00FXSHCR8|5|great stuff
B001JT5MK4|5|Beautiful, well made bag.
B0009IQXFO|4|does the job
B00JXYHTBM|3|The compressor work properly after getting the electrical connect pin properly seated. I would recommend that the electrical connection be thoroughly inspected before installation, it is very difficult to do anything with thie connector once installed.
B00CQPJW5Q|5|great product...fast shipping
B00BL54EZK|5|Perfect little kit, fast shipping, and everything you need!
B009AA2HDE|5|Awsome!
B00DQ6SIG8|4|Vibrates a little, but llets air flow through the cab.
B001NZKDIA|4|Excellent product... well finished.
B00EC2CA0K|5|these are almost too heavy for my usage...od not believe u would be disappnd if u need some as they advertise them
B008B5X5GC|5|Exact replacement for OEM -- worked perfectly!
B00OZIUHTW|5|Looks amazing on my sportster !!
B007VA6JNE|5|A must have for Jeep owners
B00LMLVH4E|5|Very satisfied
B00N4NPZIW|5|Thanks for your help, igual need this switchs for my cars.
B0019IJEHM|4|This product has eliminated a pesky &#34;Check Engine&#34; light that I had on my 1998 Saturn SL1.
B00HQZASRW|5|Made a really big difference in our Micro Minnie over a plain vent.  Comes with a full set of screws.  Instructions are poor but you should be able to figure it out, fits existing vents openings without cutting your RV.  You will need to get some butyl tape and RV sealant to complete the install.
B000V5SP92|5|Excellent better performance
B00JYMZ8HK|2|The end connecting to the RV Campsite outlet is covered under the metal lid of the junction box. BUT the end the connects to your RV is exposed to the elements.
B00267PZUK|5|This is the tool for 5.4 3v spark plug removal.
B000WP8QV8|5|I was very pleased. Arrived on time,excellent quality, made that little extra pop, and a perfect fit.
B002MZWBIK|5|Bought to mount in a BMW e53 X5.  Twenty minute install.  Looks good, minor sound at 50-70 MPH.  I wondered about loosing the end-caps but, several trips between Austin and San Antinio at 85, still hasn't jostled them free.  Would recommend.
B00F74IP74|2|ONE WHEEL WAS STRIPPED AND SLEEVE IT SCREWED INTO.
B002M9W7RQ|4|works as expected
B000E28EU2|5|The hitch took some time to install, but mounts solid. No welding was required, but the heat shield for the muffler had to be cut back a bit. This is covered in the instructions.
B004A6FBD6|5|These are the best windshield wipers made, period. They clean windshields better than any I have ever tried, and I'm sticking to these from here on out.
B002M4CB22|5|These headlights are great! And you can't beat the price. They included light bulbs, too.
B002Z64P4Y|5|perfect fit for dual axle, ST225-75r-15, good coverage
B00FVU3W4U|3|OK
B007DBBWLK|1|Not as good as OME!
B00DVQF24Y|5|I've gotten several compliments on the lanyard.  The colors pictured are accurate!
B00STU1UOI|5|second time I wrapped my pipes (2010 Yamaha raider). wish I had this the first time!
B003CK5QL8|1|Bought these for my sons dirt bike.  The first fork seal lasted one ride the second one lasted another 4 rides.  I wasted all my time replacing them, the cost of the seals, and the cost of the fork oil.  My advice, don't waste your time and money with these. These fork seals aren't worth the money  if they were free.  I will only use OEM seals from now on. Lesson learned.
B00H9MP0TS|5|Used these to hold my cables on a custom Handlebar setup on my Road King.  Have 20&#34; apes and these were great.
B003CN72LW|5|Needed more red illumination for a set of reproduction tail light lenses. They were Asian made, and not nearly as dark od red plastic as OEM stuff. These bulbs have helped to make the lenses appear red, instead of pink.
B00TJWLB62|1|I have a 2011 BMW 335i and they don't fit correctly. They bottom out on the bottom of the door storage compartment. They are about a 1/4&#34; too tall.
B000EVWDU0|5|Helps a TON with keeping track of our battery usage in our Cricket Trailer. All electricity is on 12 volt system and this is a great meter to check where we stand on battery usage.
B003V57NUQ|5|Great for the price. Instructions were not very clear but it was easy to assemble. Assembly took about 20 minutes including mounting on car.  Use it to carry a tandem kayak on a 2000 Ford Focus Wagon. Fit right on existing roof rack. I would definitely  buy again.
B000B8J6PG|2|Meh.
B000C2GGAY|5|So far so good. No leaks. Perfect fit for my 2002 Sierra z71.
B005T3WAGK|5|Color matches car nicely. Of course, it is touch-up paint, so you do not get a perfect finish, but that is what one would expect with any paint like this.
B0012X25G6|5|Great
B00AA7OFLI|5|Simple but nice
B007TYMP0I|1|Complete waste of money. Worked only for about six months. Awful quality product.
B00MJDXAB2|1|It was told to me it fits my vehicle like the other ones I purchased and I was yet disappointed again
B001CIWGHO|5|The Attwood bow light fit perfectly with no alterations. Shipping was fast and with another purchase my shipping was free of charge. If you are need of a new bow light, I strongly recommend looking at the Attwood lights.
B00Q1F76NC|5|Perfect fit. Exact match.
B001CAW2DK|5|This works great, never had a problem with it
B004J36HTM|5|Included everything in the picture and left nothing I did not need out. This was a very complete kit and now my Honda Recon runs perfect!
B007PMY3MM|4|PURCHSED 4 OF THEM VERY NICE TOUCH TO YOUR RIDE ON THE INSIDE .DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HIGH QUALITY AND COMFORT.
B002SAY98Y|5|This was easy to install and fit perfectly in my husband's 2009 Camry SE. Much cheaper than the dealership or car shops would've charged to do the same. Took my husband less than a couple of minutes.
B001UGPEEA|5|Very strong! Well finished. Solid. Easy mounting with multiple pre-drilled holes.
B009OFCR2G|4|Looks great.  The adhesive needs to be able to withstand changing temperatures. I have mine more for a special occasion driver so it sits in the garage with a cover and when I get out there the front corners are peeling up. I may buy another but I'm sure same issue. If I drove it more it would be fine. Great accent to the truck. Should of came stock.
B0049Z8X4C|3|Ok. Good replica.
B000C3ZCT4|5|Great shocks for the money, easy to install. Really made the ride nice on my Ranger.
B008MU0FWS|4|good value
B00FFIIHHU|2|Have used Raptor before and this product was supposed to be the same...  Maybe it is, but the adhesion sucks.  I have painted many things with great sucess.  This was a fail.<br /><br />I used this kit on a powder coated bumper and it started peeling within 2 months.  I scuffed it with 3m brillo on an angle grinder.  The spot it went to bare metal got quality self etching primer.  I cleaned with final wipe and spayed.  Very dissapointed.  Going back to Raptor as I have never had a problem with Raptor.<br /><br />In all fairness it could be just a bad batch or maybe it was a little too cold out when I did it.  Mid 60s or so.  Still, it should not be peeling.  I bought this because it was a few dollars less than Raptor.  You get what you pay for.  Poor me, I knew this and took the chance.  Now I have to suffer the consequences and re do.
B009SB5UC0|5|Have used this product both in minerals processing repair and maintenance application and more importantly as fantastic marine repair and through hull application, emergency repairs of frames etc by using epoxy, wire, fibre glass.  dove underwater and applied to pinhole and major leaks on pleasure craft hit by lightning! Standard line is Did you fix with grey epoxy and.........!
B00SZZKU02|5|The 100cc GOOFIT Big Bore performance kit is the best upgrade for my 50cc scooter to make the most out of it at a very affordable price.The parts are of high quality and are very easy to install. It is just what I wanted for my scooter.
B008CFA4HE|5|Bumper cover was packaged well and was already primed.  Everything lined up perfect and was very easy to install.  And for the price compared to a GM replacement, well that's an easy answer.
B00OBZ9H4A|3|It's cool. Sticks, stays, and reflects. Thick enough too.
B00WID0OEE|5|Outstanding.  A top quality squeegee.
B002OAT5S2|3|Item is good but no real leather
B004I0HFQK|5|great replacement item. works perfect and easy to replace. Best price found too.
B0013CRFD4|5|Good product
B00029WYVW|5|Thanks You!!!
B00J9QQFQY|5|Fits perfect for my Subaru Forester 2010 . Very comfortable on my arm,resting. have two German Shepherds that nails destroyed my arm rest. wish i knew of this product much sooner. they like to stand on it and now they have a grip when doing so.
B000C7YQ9M|3|It fits but it's not easy to loosen once you get it to click. Maybe it's not the best one for my 2005 Ford Explorer. It arrived quickly & is as described.
B006YW4SMY|1|needed more parts for this to work bearing should be part of this kit
B000C9CCJ6|5|Just as described and fit perfectly.
B004CXK5LA|5|Fast shipping. Good fit. Great sound. Best option for crew cab long bed.
B004DRX9NQ|4|Exactly what described.
B00BJ7ZY2W|5|Good product and price is great.
B000C73C5Q|5|Great fit on my 91 camaro.
B00PSRORH2|5|The shades stick to the windows well and block out the sun efficiently for our kiddos. They even fit in the back windows of a van which is nice since they're smaller.
B00A14H3TG|5|Great
B000EQB6KS|4|It fit perfectly and seems to be working just fine.
B002YORJTK|5|It really hold the charge for a long time when I just use it, works great.
B00D0BQKM8|5|Fit perfect and fast service.
B00LHJFL2U|4|Fits and works. I will need to see it work for at least 6 mos before I can give it 5 stars.
B004ALJDEY|5|a great package to initiate my project
B000B8I61G|1|Very poor quality. It arrived broken, and seemed to flimsy to bother requesting another.
B00WYIAB1Y|5|Others said order a size larger then norm. Good advice, glad i listened. Bluetooth works great! Works with my Samsung S3 phone great to listen to tunes, haven't  tried the phone feature yet. Some mentioned hard to get glasses on, yes it is, hard to get the bows behind your ears, but with a few tries no problem.
B005UUIECQ|4|I did like this product. It just didn't look or fit like I WANTED. I would not dissuade others from purchasing this product, because it is as described and it is made of quality material! I returned my order though and these guys agreed to refund my money no questions asked! I am employed in the motor industry and I will say, that, even though things didn't work out with my satisfaction with the chrome cover, this company is A+++ in my book, and I WILL be purchasing items from them again!
B0042HBNZI|5|If it wasn't for google searching, I probably would have wasted both time and money dropping the fuel tank and replacing the fuel level sensor located in the tank just to discover that this wasn't the issue at all.  I would have never figured out that it was this part that was causing my fuel level issue with my 2002 Ford Taurus.  I would also like to thank Suburban Ford for listing this part on Amazon Prime.  Please note that this part is only used on the flex fuel models.  I was able to get to my unit without having to pull the radio.  Our symptoms included:  Empty fuel level readings when fuel was present in the tanlk, full level readings when less than a full tanks of fuel was in the tank, occasional accurate readings, check engine light coming on typically when hitting the empty tank condition.
B004ZF3KA8|5|I installed Kensun HID headlight kits on both of my motorcycles and loved the results.  So I ordered the H13 kit for my 2010 Jeep Wrangler.  The jeep uses a single bulb for both low and high beams, and the Kensung HID kit provides a relay to power ballasts for both lights.  All the wiring in the kit was a bit confusing at first, because the instructions kind of suck.  But, if you take your time and lay everything out, it is pretty straight forward and not as bad as it first looks.  I had a great install done myself, in about an hour and love the results.  It was a great improvement over the stock Wrangler headlights.  The HID bulbs fit right into the existing reflector assemblies perfectly.  I now have very bright lights at a fraction of the cost of other available upgrades.  This is my third set I've bought and they have been working without fail on my motorcycles.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to friends!  The 6000k bulbs are bright white and only slightly blue.  Look fantastic!
B000RN2ERM|5|My son is a great fan and loves this tag on the front of his truck.
B0095TC604|5|A really great product. I bought these for my 2015 Ford F-150 to tow our travel trailer and they work great. I did add some little blind spot mirrors to each side to help out.  Update: The first time out I had problems keeping the mirrors on. Then the driver side mirror fell off and got ran over. Amazon was great and sent a new pair. I had mounted the first ones on top of the mirror but now I am mounting them on the bottom of the mirror and they seem to be a lot more stable. Unfortunately there are no instructions or advice on which way would be the better way to mount them.
B010Q03LJU|1|Like a previous reviewer, the pre-drilled holes in the bracket did not align correctly with my 2005 4Runner. Not only were the holes too small for the existing bolts, the spacing between the two holes was not wide enough. What should have been a 15 minute job turned into an hour-long ordeal. Can't believe this product was listed to fit the vehicles it's purported to fit.
B000EBICHI|1|not fit in my volvo s40 ... so not good!!
B00Q88PAHQ|5|Fit as it should, great price.
B00IG0C202|1|Had them for three months then I noticed today they won't turn off and they won't cycle threw all the colors. I disconnected them from the battery and the plugs. Plugged everything back up and still wasn't fixed
B000CQHVLI|5|Just used a few weeks ago and fixed multiple cracks in exhaust and cured within 30 minutes. Just need to run engine until pipes are very hot and shut engine off. Then apply with hand (would recommend using throw away gloves).
B00M0ZCHYA|3|They look cool but you can't adjust. Hope your truck is straight in the front. Because if its not you'll know come dark.
B00B2BUTWK|4|The color was perfect. It did not leave much margin, maybe 2 inches on each side, but my car is a wildcat.
B00JOC2CLA|3|it fits ok, but has a permanent roll at the edges, comes shipped rolled up tight, been in car for months & still has curled edges
B001DRNNKI|5|Great quality. Fits perfectly 2006 Passat.
B000E3487E|5|Excellent
B006RUJ2D8|5|A great product, does what it says it does
B0024NT250|5|Great product at a reasonable price. This is cheaper than the so called &#34;treatment&#34; they charge an arm and a leg for that lasts maybe a month. The install does take a little longer than expected.
B000C9JZH8|2|Slow shipping, part appears to be correct though. Long term update. The coolant temp side for the ECM is dead on, but the side for the gauge reads about 15 degrees colder than actual temp. Have read this is a common complaint with the new AC DELCO senders.
B0018PSASU|3|Ok on the brake pins, but it does run when used on other parts.  For any external brake parts you should use classic anti-seize.
B001GN1GLM|5|it is what it is, arrived very quickly
B00AFWP5U8|3|I like the bag, but it stated a pair I only received one!
B00ICBXY8Y|5|Awesome
B00IKIZX42|5|fit 2005 Tuscon as advertised.  can't say how long they will last put the rotors are at least as good as those from the parts store at a considerable savings. they are identical to those i replaced.  Well machined and preserved.<br /><br />I mentioned the part about lasting above because in the past with auto store OEM parts those rotors were only good for the life of one set of pads.  i think it might have something to do with the alloy of the metal maybe less expensive than that used for more expensive rotors.  However, for the Tuscon with over 160,000 miles these will do nicely.
B002ZBWKAU|4|love the auto shut off but the nozzle gets hot after a minute of continuous use.
B00D8KJ8AM|5|Better then those carpet mats very good quality
B006K8V3XE|4|excellently built unit easy to install
B00N0IHMXM|5|Not much to say about this item....just a handy item to keep in your tool box to make your life easier.
B00IQ71NF0|4|perfect fit, Forester 2014
B00H9MF8WM|5|This stuff worked great!
B004AL5V90|5|The battery worked perfectly. Great product and excellent service. Thank you !
B000HTNPLU|5|Good stuff
B00OLOXFSA|5|Worked great no issue for my 2003 Kawasaki 636 help keep the screws tight I put a small washer between it and the bars had no issues so far after 500 miles
B0080N35J2|5|Very nice. Love it
B00P5YOU3O|5|Easy to apply and looks great.
B00546C8UA|5|It's a Cargo Net...
B00S5HMVM0|5|Works great on the back of my John Deere.
B002UCAFXI|1|I don't usually write bad reviews--my grandmother always said if you don't have anything good to say--don't say anything at all. However, this product did NOT work at all! I hope I can save $ for someone else because I certainly wasted my money on this un-amazing ripoff! I bought it for mildew stains on canvas and followed the directions on bottle and website. Used the entire bottle (several days of application) and stain remains.
B0052LQQFK|5|Perfect size...works as<br />advertised....keeps my rear<br />end dry and comfortable
B002R8C178|4|Great product but difficult to get on the seats. Will probably order custom covers in the future.
B00230P8J8|5|Fit perfectly on my 2015 HD Street Glide.
B00KY6WU8U|5|Does a great job are holding the bike
B00KTJ1N0I|5|Works perfectly and received it quickly!
B0095TC6I6|4|worked great a little shaky, I'm sure that would be hard to fix overall very happy
B005UD6CGS|5|Came in sooner than stated. Husband put it on and it ran great
B0036VQUOA|4|Nice product.
B00O3GUOB2|1|the decals had bubbles and pealed off don't buy!!!
B00JK324Z2|5|This is a very nice set. People say you get what you pay for but honestly at the price you would expect the cheap ones and these are not. I received a discount off the price for my review and these are a great set for using in your car. I have a silverado truck also and these will do the trick. A car will jump pretty quick and you may have to wait a few minutes for a little larger car or truck but these will work for those too. They are well made and will be a nice addition to the small emergency set of tools I have. If you want a set for the big rigs, this isn't it but you won't get set like that at this price either.
B0026M9DZS|5|Works great. Arrived quickly and very happy. Thanks
B0019C4Y6E|5|Perfect!
B00C5RBRA8|5|This is simply the best sewer hose available.  I've tried numerous other brands but none of them lasted.  This my second Camco hose with Rhino fittings (my first one lasted two years of full-timing in my RV) and I'll never use another brand again.
B00NSXFXBM|5|Great color. I like that it didn't have a lot of glue on the back, sticking it to the packaging. I have purchased other magnets, from other dealers, that had so much glue that I had to wash the magnet to keep from getting glue on my car.  Fast shipping. Item was exactly as described. Great seller.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|I really like it
B0072RTNM0|5|These fit my 2012 civic coupe perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for!
B00EYPEU9O|1|Worked perfectly, the as always the service was exceptional.
B001AZEMI0|2|Not a good seat for riders
B00H7LPKKU|5|used very little so far, but am very impressed
B0089SZW62|5|perfect
B00D8ZA1KS|5|Did as described
B00062YUUS|5|The leads are of sufficient length, nice detail in the manual, and the analogue dial is easy to read.
B00UCTY6V8|1|Doesn't stay in place....useless
B00M78820I|5|Excellent product, easy to use, and they are doing the job.
B005CF8758|5|Makes a huge difference in keeping heat out.
B00SNCYUCG|4|Helmet is very comfortable works great pricewise very expensive through Amazon cheaper through other companies
B00HI5WFAS|1|Did not fit my vehicle at all..put in correct information and it said right vehicle but was way off from fitting
B000WJIPD8|5|Looks great on my husbands ninja.
B00ZD8J9VA|5|Very cute and it stuck well. Ursula is so hard to find good decals of and I was so happy to find this one. I cant speak to how well it holds up but if you dont hear from me again you can assume its still sticking! I ordered it in lavender which is exactly as described. Instructions were included and shipping was extremely fast for me. Thank you!
B00X9J9Y7E|2|Easy install looks.good but when you drive over 35 mph the glass shakes so bad you cant hardly see
B000Q6A5JE|5|I am a big fan of OTC. This tool was well thought out, very functional, very well designed, and very tough. The size, length, and strength of the tool helps to make fan clutch removal a breeze.  Works great on ford 6.8 ! Great price on Amazon.
B00JH24E22|5|It fit good and works good
B00KRKAXVE|5|Money well spent
B003CEFJ2A|5|Fits great
B0006309AM|5|Perfect replacement for my K&N cold air system.
B005C1B6LO|4|EASY to bend. Similar to thin tin. Looks awesome on my bike
B00CIVSA2E|5|it works fine, thankyou
B003JOB594|4|Worked as advertised... be sure that dye is in system.
B003FBV8ZW|5|THEY CONFORM TO A NICE FIT AND FIT.
B004NSJRNG|5|These lights work great and are very bright great buy
B0006IX87S|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B00HPTE41U|5|Very Nice
B0021UXUSQ|4|Found my leak in seconds thanks to this kit
B00B8BDWS2|5|I bought it for my 2000 honda civic ex and it fit perfectly, a little fenesing had to be done but that will be with any rad support most painfull part of the installation was removing the old since it was spot welded on there and i drilled all spot weld off, make sure ur carefull when grabbing ahold of this radiator support it is very sharp in some places
B001RPV59W|5|As mentioned in the only other worthy review, these fit tight onto 12awg wire. They feel a bit firmer than OE seals as well. They also fit into and seal the connector well. Only time will tell if they last long. I expect they will.
B0016KH1XM|5|Exactly what I needed. Thank you!
B005C59NO2|5|This is a great way to cut down the beginning slack and make more immediate power on a ninja 300. It is slightly too large for the throttle assembly to move freely, so a little sanding to make it slightly smaller will give it enough room to fit like a glove.
B000VEHNTG|5|Good lights<br />Very bright
B00400IYTK|4|I had it professionally installed and it seems to be working great 2 months into it.
B00BVB50TS|5|Just as advertised fit perfectly and worked right out of the box. Good deal fast shipping.  No problems here.
B004AJA9M6|5|it fit my 2015 Tacoma like a glove there are 2 braces you will not need due to they are all ready on the truck
B004ZF3Y40|4|Super bright and easy to install. Work great so far we will see how they last.
B000VKVXOG|4|Nice replacement filters. Not as thick as the OEM but then they were 1/4th the price off the dealer.
B001PNAQG4|5|Perfect, exactly what I needed. No issues.
B00BMUDOLE|5|Ordered two for my solar powered 1800watt battery backup. Very sturdy built batteries. Easy to handle with the two built in side handles. Made dropping it into the battery box a breeze.
B003V57NUQ|2|I purchased this item for installation on a 2013 Toyota Highlander.  Upon assembly it was immediately obvious that the depth of the screws below the the platform was too long and would not fit without scratching my rooftop.  I ditched the unnecessary knobs and used a hacksaw to cut off the middle screws to a length that would fit.
B00AJTTWFG|5|Very pleased with these pulleys.  They even seem like they are better quality then the original stock pulleys I took off of my Honda rider; the old ones only had like four spot welds; these have six rivets; and they feel like they maybe thicker heavier metal then the old ones.<br /><br />NOT complaining or saying the old pulleys were bad quality; just worn out after all these years.  The bearing was so worn that it was causing the belt to vibrate like crazy.  Now it runs nice and smooth.<br /><br />These old Honda riders run forever.  Just add gas and change oil; change the belts and sharpen blades.  So I didn't mind changing a couple of pulleys after all these maintenance free years.  Should be good for another 100,000 miles of lawn cutting HA!!!
B000KQ4J1U|5|These fit my 14 Taco very well and stay seated when opening and closing the windows there is an discomforting popping noise when I close the passenger window but I have found no sign of damage to the vehicle, tint, and or product.
B005R27ZK4|1|Not happy with this  product . Seems like I was installing a  giant  nylon stocking !
B00PSWJRMM|2|It's ok
B0000AY4YT|5|Great product everyone.
B000QQXAHI|5|Work great
B003XWG7R2|5|Pretty Straight forward, mounting was a challenge due to door frame but if you're no afraid to drill some holes then no problem, my biggest issue was finding power, the car was stock without pwr windows but the fuse box had a place for pwr windows, had to access the wire behind the fuse box, pulled it out of the wire bundle enough to use butt connectors (too tight for soldering) then grounded ground to bare metal under dash and the rest was wire routing.  Everything worked so happy camper am I.  Kept the cranks just in case and caps where cranks were are easy to remove (for just in case).
B002VVOF02|5|Install was quick as ca be and so far absolutely no problems.  No squeek or anything and I did not add any compound to the back of the pad.
B000HVTERW|5|Easily holds clothes. Great value
B00GFR06U6|5|Looks great
B00WS7DAFK|5|My big concern was bending the truck bed from tying down the bikes.  This is the perfect solution,  the installation went quick and seems solid so far.
B00E5OUOCQ|2|Bought it for my truck, did not go all the way across or up and down. Too small for F350, gave it away, no use for it
B000HDG0S6|5|Works very well and gives a sense of security that a gust of wind is not going to drop a hood on me giving me a Marie Antoinette bob cut.
B000CIY0U6|5|Trimming the mat wasn't necessary for my Dodge Ram 1500 but I did end up cutting off about an inch and a quarter length wise... there's a metal lip on the top edge of the tailgate I wanted the mat to butt up against..so it was flush and didn't protrude up.  Turned out to be worth it.. looks factory .  Very happy with it.  They also gave me way too many mounting screws (which in turn i used for the bed mat I got from Westin).. great combo!<br /><br />Instead of going to the clear top where the plastic tailgate cap bolts over the tailgate..
B009FUF6DM|4|I originally bought these to use as gym towels but they are too small. Instead I use them to polish my car. Works great.
B003VAWQNK|5|ved earlier than expected. SINCE THE EXACT REPLACEMENT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE, THIS WAS CLOSEST AND WAS NO TROUBLE ADAPTING it to fit. It is working perfect. thanks upon thanks.
B000E28EG6|5|Great Quality. Cheaper options out there also not bad.
B00UB2WI4S|2|i have burgundy/ maroon car, and the letters dont particularly stand out. Damn.
B000CB3Z7W|5|Your basic Mann filter, great for my E36 BMW
B00W8ADB1K|5|I am a travel blogger/YouTuber, am residing in my Class A RV (&#34;Jimmy Lee&#34;), TORIng America, with my two fur-babies, Freckeez James (Chinese Crested), and Figee Ann (Affenpinscher).  Needless to say, we are going in, and out, of Jimmy Lee many times day, and night; and with that comes stuff!  Lots, and lots, of stuff! Especially, when you consider, that's 10 feet, of excited family members exploring new surroundings, and discovering new places, and people.<br /><br />When the opportunity arose to review the HangPro organizer, and give my feedback I was eager to see if it would benefit my lifestyle. Well by golly, it does!<br /><br />As you can imagine, my space is very limited, and each square inch is a precious commodity. Not only does 'stuff' take-up room, but it also cost me in hauling it. Because every mile counts when you're traveling in your home, it's not money smart to carry unnecessary 'stuff' - and if you can't see it, and aren't organized, then 'stuff' comes creeping in, and next thing you know, everything from the transmission to the tires become jeopardized.<br /><br />That's why this organizer is the perfect complement to my passenger cabin chair. Jimmy Lee's door opens just behind the chair. So with the organizer hanging over, it's a great set-up. I can store my daily activities in it (hiking gear, Freckeez & Figee's stuff, camera, maps, etc.). I can organize for whatever is happening for the week, in lieu of digging through, and wasting time once I arrive somewhere, I can sit it out the night before in my organizer. Plus, if I'm renting a car for the day, it's mobile, and I can take it with me.<br /><br />Overall: Quality made, heavy-duty mesh pockets, and straps, easy to install, and take mobile. It deserves a 5 star out of 5 star review!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review.

B002UKYKIG|5|Very easy to apply. Looks great on my car.
B00ZP4781U|5|I love this back seat mirror it is the perfect size for seeing my bean in the backseat!I would say the quality is just as good.
B00CRPAHKE|5|great product,but is listed 2 pc and you get one...I call Amazon and I got the second one very fast,thanks.
B005B0SC0O|4|Ty
B005TOLSBC|5|I was so worried to order any electronics from online, in fear of not being good quality, but boy, was I wrong!! Priced low and in excellent condition!! Works perfectly!! Described exactly as seller stated!! Fast shipping too!! Thank you!!
B007G5SHK2|5|Excellent fit, great quality, easy install!!
B003A2E7KE|5|Great light!
B00266Z8MQ|1|Not bright.
B00AK0LBLW|1|Worked for 3 days.... awesome when I first got it. I now realize you get what you pay for. SmH
B003I58RM2|4|Kinda long break in period, and does have a fair bit of dusting but no real noise and the stopping is much better than the HAWK LTS pads I dumped after 2500 miles of terrible performance.  Not perfect, but some of the best brake pads so far.
B004C6E7RK|1|Smaller than advertized and not usable
B00K2SLS7O|5|A
B0015D19SS|4|This rack is quick and easy to put on/off and we use it for our kayak on the hard-top roof of a Jeep Wrangler. Along with a Rhino rack T-Loader, I can now carry my kayak or canoe on a Jeep without putting any holes or clips on the hard top. Using a thicker swim &#34;noodle&#34; around the exposed center of rack protects the boat and the rack. It was just what I was looking for.
B00NAAY9EA|5|Got these as a Father's Day gift for my Dad, who has an '85 Vette. He loved them. They fit perfectly.
B001RO8AD2|4|Great gift, haven't been used just yet.
B00074Q29W|5|The sway bar is working just fine.  Good job.
B00V2BA7GI|4|Product exactly as advertised. Very easy to apply and it is holding fine, which is amazing since the surface of the laptop is a bit textured. My only gripe is that the dot on top of the Tardis sits on the branding emblem (either the apple or in my case the HP) and since that part of the laptop is etched, it won't stick. Otherwise, I love it.
B008L0DPE4|4|For the price is worth it!. Compare to the stock on the 2015 ninja ex650, it make a big difference!. This thing is loud!!!.. Woke up the whole Community.
B000HAB7B4|5|They met my expectations, I wasn't disappointed
B009T9QXF4|4|They are great in terms of they do their job. They remain clean for me and I don't really slide on them so they have a nice grip for your feet...however, if you are unfortunate to have lost your floormat clips, this thing does not grip the carpet very well. It has slid around on my floor for some time and never stays in one place. Thankfully it never goes under the pedals but I do have to readjust its position once a week. I knocked one star for the grip being an utter fail, but at the same time without the clips it is partially my fault.
B00252EIK4|5|Good quality
B006WPQNB2|5|I actually have three of these.  I have a family of six.  We are on a septic system.  Our drain fields got full of water because of the rains we have been experiencing for days on end.  The house toilets will not flush. I have a Porta Potti now in each bathroom and they are wonderful.  There is a button that you push that sprays water that rinses the bowl after use and a lever on the side that flushes the waste away. They are easy to use, very clean, no odor, easy to empty.  I would highly recommend this product.  The uses are endless for example, a bedside toilet for those who are sick, for camping, or just for an extra toilet for convenience possibly in a workshop.  This is an excellent product.
B00QY3R8WU|5|These adapters work GREAT and do not leak
B007AOQW24|5|Get them with every new car
B00FAWKSYG|4|Good quality bumper, fits my Polaris RZR 2013 well. I am satisfied with the product.
B001GF2Q0U|5|great accessory to have, doesn't bow in like the cheap sunshields.  if you're gone from your car for more then an hour then it doesn't help much, but if it's for protecting your interior then it blocks the sun 100 percent.  --- I appreciate your time and feedback. If you have found my review helpful, please click the &#34;Thumbs Up” to let me know. Thank you!
B00DMS648E|1|Its not working at all
B00C1MHM92|5|works well. I put it on the back bumper of my 2014 prius and it protected the finish from the idiot san francisco parkers who actually left their car touching my bumper
B0078SZRQO|1|tiny, hard brittle plastic, no way to attach anywhere in vehicle
B00E4CUFTG|5|I ride a motorcycle and I wear contacts. It never fails that wind ends up coming over, under or through the sides of my sunglasses. Not with these. These are great at keeping the wind. Of course the shape of your face has something to do with it too, but I've gone through some very expensive pairs of sunglasses and then these and these are the ones that work.<br /><br />They're stylish, no fog (due to the light foam padding) and they're comfortable. The only thing I had to do was remove the rubber strip on the inside of each of the ear pieces because they kept pulling my hair out.
B0046KIABG|5|great present for my son=in-law, delivered fast
B00GSAUHB8|4|Great Shade to avoid heating of the car Sun.
B00GJKXW8M|4|These lights are very solid feeling and to put out a large amount of light.  The only complaint I have is they allow some water in behind the lens.
B00GNTHTJM|1|I give it 1 star, cuz only one light is working,  out of the packages.  It needs to have pressure applied between the body and LED'S for it to work. And now I have to go through the trouble to order a new set. Juet incase one don't work !
B00PP6CEX0|4|Works great, fits like OEM, would be 5 stars but have to pull inside handle twice to open when locked, OEM does it in one pull.
B00AERSDWG|4|Overall good guage to have
B00RM26HH4|4|Great product to protect your fob.  Too late for us as we ran over our fob, but this covers up the damage.  Only disappointment is the leather is not as soft s we would like.  Almost as hard as plastic.
B005FM0ZRG|5|Perfect fit for my 98 Chevy K1500.  Chrome looks good too
B003I3FNH6|5|These are great!!! Seriously a terrific purchase!
B007LIA6K8|5|covers a bad steering wheel well.  Great feel.
B004J0Y36O|5|Great price
B001GRMC5W|5|Fits EXACTLY...just as stated by WeatherTech. Keeps all the dirt, mud etc. off my trunk carpet. This is a good purchase.
B002IWP39Q|5|It was like adding jewerly to the car.  I hated seeing the dealer outline around the tag
B00FOOPNJU|1|I think I'm going to return this item it is the wrong shade and texture and the lever is shiny chrome the original is more of a mat finish
B00P7QIFQ8|1|Don't stay on to visor
B00TEICVHY|5|Its really good, fits perfectly on my '07 Tundra, quiet easy to install, and delivers the right amount of mA.<br />Side note: It gives a dark blue glow from the ports, I find it nice.
B00AWPHDJ4|2|The bag seems like it's good quality but it leaked on the first use. Also the item I received was not the same as the pictured item (missing Sea Doo written across the middle and the 2nd rubber band going across on top that I can only guess helps keep water out). Sadly I returned it and will go with another brand.
B008B7KXBK|2|Sent me wrong one don't fit 2004 g35
B0095EH3SY|3|One of the canvas pull tabs came broken, and the spring on the other hook went bad. You get what you pay for.
B00Y4K10CE|5|On time, and easy to apply.  I think it's really funny.
B0097A9PDC|5|worked as it should
B001O0AMZS|5|Great product and fast service...
B00BR06GPA|4|Received in excellent condition. Did not fit our spare tire well however, '14 Optima SXL. Not sure why. Returned without problem but charged a restock fee. MAKE SURE you check your spare tire well dimensions before ordering this.
B003VLBPJA|2|Much smaller than I thought.  Not really useful on an FZ8.  Good quality though.
B0023VDYPC|5|Fits like the original.
B00NQ9P9FS|5|Good stuff fast shipping
B00DSD7VLC|5|what can I say...KERMIT!!!
B000RJMG8S|5|A present that was perfect! Only took 2 days to get them.
B00CFO86QE|5|Arrived as promised, quality A+
B0002SQW34|5|Excellent results been using it for years
B009EVOWPA|2|The side pockets for water bottles are too small ?? Did they not even check before manufacturing? . Have to work diligently with both hands to get it to accept even a smal water bottle. Just gave up and don't use them. Center pockets are small also. Found it is mostly just in the way, instead of useful.
B00192JFD6|5|Easy install,works well.
B008DREON6|3|Cheap, but functional. One seam is already loose.
B000EQNTG2|5|Quality brakes at an amazing price. Would have paid almost triple in my home town for this quality of brake shoes. Thank you.
B003CH09S6|1|It clearly says &#34;lightweight aluminium&#34;, it is not. it is chrome plated steel. I needed aluminium for my application. aluminium is not magnetic, this item is. sticks quite well to a magnet... I will say it is good quality, but not what i ordered.
B000MIT5VA|1|Not upholstered like advertised. Dented speaker. No wires included. Very disappointed.
B001JT3I0U|5|A Montana Ford dealers shop foreman highly recommended addition @ each fuel up for our variable vaned turbo diesel!
B004TSCT3U|5|Great product
B005XO3OII|4|Thanks
B00MZKCO20|5|These were for my Son.  Exactly what he needed
B001AM8L08|5|Perfect fit
B00HNNX4OG|3|Had since Feb 2015 and the bulbs have yellowed and three leds have stopped working all together.
B007GFML72|5|Makes changing a tire so much easier & doesn't require all that much to get the job done.
B000CK5Q34|3|Good product
B00VU5BVIY|5|just had to drill two holes into arctic cat 1000 s hitch plate. works just fine.
B0009I0DCS|5|love it!
B00HQQXOPO|5|I don't consider myself too technically inclined, but these lights were very easy to install. Removing the lens covers made me a little nervous, but once you do the first one or two, you realize how much pressure/strength to use.<br /><br />The lights looks very nice and bright, but not blinding. I didn't realize the kit came with the rear license plate lamps, as well as the external reverse light above the rear center window, so that was a nice perk.
B004TMHF8K|1|This unit came broken.  It would not light up.  Still waiting for a replacement.
B00820NOWG|1|Did not fit my Volvo.  Not useful to me.
B004HYRIBE|5|Perfect fit! Easy installation! Looks great! I have a lawn service and am constantly loading and unloading my 2011 Silverado... I lo e this product!
B006X8C7RW|5|looks very nice on my 98 gt
B001JT1FJ6|4|Have used before and the product works well. Preventative maintenance for my offshore boat. Shipping and delivery were fast.
B005IHD2IM|1|Very low quality..
B00K35UO0S|4|Installed with no problems. Only issue I had was no documentation on how much oil was already added to the compressor or the type of oil.
B00CT30SSU|5|Fits in a 2014 forester xt. Much less expensive than letting the dealer do it. If you're not sure how to remove the glovebox, search YouTube for a video.
B003ZWHMGU|5|Perfect fit!
B00TZ1EDN0|5|Exactly what I needed to replace the sun baked one on my truck
B00N431BQM|5|It filters air, and looks pretty slick. Great buy for the price
B00H1JCXGC|5|2007 Dodge Caliber was throwing P2004 code. Did some online research and decided $70 to try to fix the issue was better than giving the dealer $300-$800. It seems to have corrected the issue.<br />Dorman does make some great, quality parts and generally at a decent price.
B00ZME8GS2|4|Easy to use as long as you have a tire balancer, now let's see how well the adhesive works on the put 250 miles one the bike since i mounted and balanced the tire works great so far waiting for it to rain to see if that affects the adhesive.So far no problem.
B00NAIS9WA|5|Exactly as described
B0012WHBSO|5|Quickly pumps up tires to 50psi and does not feel like it will over heat.  No waiting for an hour as you would with some other brands.  I wish there was a little bit longer 12v cord to reach trailer tires, but it will reach vehicle tires easily.
B00K2FGB10|5|it is a good lift and ez to  put on .
B00NL2RAC0|5|These are comfortable, and they look great in my truck. I've had people ask if they were the stock seats because they give a high end appearance. They also hold up to spills. While transporting a brisket to a family reunion, some juice spilled on the cover, and it didn't go through the back side on to my factory seats. Exactly what I bought these for.
B00C5RBRA8|5|Fit and works! thanks!
B008YJTHBW|5|Excellent
B000FKKOK6|5|Paired up with 72112 for a great sound on the bike.....this WILL wake them up!
B004I145CQ|5|Just what was needed!
B00F4YHODS|3|The item is not truly fitted for my vehicle!
B00JBR9NAQ|4|Product looks and feels high quality.  Lever is secure in the closed position, yet easy to operate with a single finger.<br /><br />I knocked one star off because there was no beveling on the end, so it was an absolute pain to get it started into the oil pan without cross threading.  I even compared it to the oil plug a few times to make sure the threading was correct.  I eventually got it started, and everything was easy from there.  Hopefully, I should never have to do it again, so it was a minor annoyance.
B00BL00NXM|5|It fits a 2009 Forester
B00EUVYPV0|5|LIKE IT
B00LXVSCXM|4|I got this just for the novelty of having my classic Cadillac look like a Pixar Car,  but it actually really keeps the temperature down when parked,  and keeps the sun off the leather :)<br />My only gripes are that it could be up  to a foot wider,  and the 'dip' for the rear-view mirror wasn't shallow enough, so I had to trim it with scissors to fit around the mirror.  I love it though,  so 4 stars.
B00YRZVAK8|4|nice
B00YD0DXH0|1|I ordered this chain as a replacement because my old chain was wore out. Green is my favorite color so of course I ordered this one. All in all, I love the chain. It wasn't the bright green they show it to be in the picture, but I don't care about that. The reason I'm leaving this with a one star rating is because the master link they provide does not have a lock piece on it. It's the master link, 4 little black rubber rings, the outside piece, and a pack of some type of white, tacky substance. Now, I assume the white substance is suppose to act as some sort of adhesive to keep the outter piece on. At least, that's what I tried to use it for because there was nothing in the box or package telling what it was for and it was too sticky to be grease. So I tried to use it to hold the outter piece on and I let the stuff have time to sit. After I got everything back together, I maybe rode my four wheeler around for about two minutes before I heard my chain hit up against my frame. I immediately got off the four wheeler to check and see what the deal was and I noticed that my chain was in two pieces and the master link was missing. So I took the old master link and lock key from my old chain and used it instead. Once I did that, everything was fine and it seems to be holding up well. You guys seriously need to rethink your design for your master links because that's not very safe.
B00BYWXMSA|5|Very easy to install, considering I've never even changed my own oil before. I did a 10 mile gas mileage test with the stock filter and a 10 mile test with the K&N after installation. With the K&N my gas mileage increase ~1.6 mpg. Additionally, I noticed my car was a little louder and had a very small acceleration boost. The thickness of the filter is about half of the thickness of the stock filter. I wanted to see how the airflow was in comparison between both filters so I used my mouth to blow air through each of them. With the stock filter, it was almost impossible to get any air through. However, with the K&N it was very easy. Was skeptical about buying this, but I recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />I installed this product on a 2014 Dodge Dart 2.4L rally edition.
B00J89HNRW|4|Great decal, glad I bought it. It even came with a smaller one. I do wish it was made with higher quality vinyl with better adhesive backing.. No regrets, its on my phone! :)
B004BSCVAO|2|Nothing ultra about this product.
B00HE7SJ7S|2|They are very bright and look great but I had to order 2 sets the first set only 1 of the bulbs worked. After having to buy a second set because the first set had one bad bulb. Now the second bulb has already burned out after having it on for 6 months. This product has poor quality control and I do not recommend it.
B001U60T9U|5|Quality product at a good price
B00IR3ZXJ0|4|Good
B005JU5VH8|5|These wiper blades do a great job. This pair was installed on a Mercury and fit with ease.
B000C01T3K|1|Even though they say the fit 2011 Elantra limited, they don't. They are too thick.
B00GRBGDUW|4|It's a very nice liner and works very well as I have used it for hauling rocks and dirty stuff.  Just lift it out and dump it.  I would have liked a better fit as it is too small for my 2014 Buick Encore by over an inch of width.
B00SS3GBLI|4|thanx
B00JXYFGOY|5|Fixed the issue.
B000ENOPO0|2|Lousy packaging......leaked all over the box, and the tube was kinked from being so bent. Otherwise a good enough product.
B00Y9MHRC4|5|Very Nice
B0009H51B2|5|Amazing soap, very concentrated. It leaves your car super clean and shiny. Great to use for preparation for waxing. I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone.
B00LL4DRDQ|5|Very Nice
B001S80ZE4|5|Great product and fast shipping
B005DTWUDI|5|Bought for wife's 04 GTO and so far has been awesome.
B00ELN88O2|5|Love it!
B000C9TD66|4|A good filter, OEM quality.  The only thing that could be better is the rubber gasket.  It is hard to use when holding up the tranny pan with one hand and tightening all 20 bolts making sure the gasket is in the proper place.  I re-used the metal stock gasket because you don't have to mess around with keeping the rubber gasket flat as it likes to bend all over the place.
B00N08WHXM|1|THEY DID NOT FIT AT ALL, NO INSTRUCTIONS, NO SUPPORT
B00JOY6U7U|5|Heavy duty and it works. Very nice to spend your money and get a great value. The wiring is heavy enough to carry 24 volts and 12v of course.   Update:  I had to send mine back it was not passing the power on.  I feel like it was the way the factory packed it in the box it had some tight twists on the receptacle end of the cord. In any case amazon quickly replaced it and i am happy with the outcome. Interestingly enough the replacement had no twists.  When I was trying to figure out what was causing my problem I looked it over much more closely than before, it is very well made. Even heavy cord can be damaged with twisting.
B0031OVZ3S|5|Very good quality and very easy to install.  Its not 100% color matching, but I say 90%+.  I recently purchased a 2015 Kawasaki Mule Trans in the realtree camo color.  I would buy again.
B00VUGQ0WK|5|Arrived today, 2 days ahead of schedule! I bought a pair to use in addition to my high beams, and they are perfect. Super bright, they completely obliterate my HID headlights!
B00JIIZCM6|5|I desparately needed to clean our dual reclining leather love seat.  I've tried many other products and had very little success.  This product did the job, and did not require a lot of elbow grease.  Great product!  Would definitely recommend this to others.  I had a great experience with this seller and would purchase from them again.  A++
B007HGCFAS|5|great replacment fit perfect arrived on time as always
B002HTXR7K|5|Fit my 2008 Chevy Short Bed just fine and looks sharpe and clean.. Thanks!!
B001NYYSLY|1|The install was not bad, but took some time getting the cover know adjustment correct. The fan slowed and stopped after about 4 camping trips, now need to spin the blades to get it going again. The screen was too close to the fan and often made a scraping noise, eventually I just removed the screen. Maybe I just got a bad one, but now too late to return it a through Amazon and no response from the company. It is only two months old for crying out loud...anyway, I'll be doing the good ol' Fantastic fan instead now.
B006K8V6JA|5|Good
B00I2I24Y2|5|looks great, easy to install, very brite
B001CA6VLE|3|I was disappointed to see SKS stamped on each bearing. I went out of my way to buy  Timken bearings made in the USA. I wrote for clarification of this issue but received no response.
B00VHQF0TC|2|Elastic closure strap broke the first time I tried to use it. Not too pleased with the product. Does not fit my window properly. I guess it's back to the old fanfold type for me.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Fits my car perfectly, material looks durable.
B00RGOQ944|3|Yes the item meet my expectations by have an issue with the DBScar unit, the Bluetooth keeps dropping and I noticed that the power indicator shows blue light and the Bluetooth indicator show red, which I believe it's wrong?
B005ADY8V4|5|For the price you will not find anything comparable to the lisle pipe stretcher in this kit. I am absolutely impressed.
B0031I8096|2|MADE IN CHINA !!
B001QRTZR0|3|They are good, but I was expecting better.
B004HCM9H4|5|Great Product
B0069VV7YC|5|Good for my order and very very good seller.
B0035XGPNA|5|Armor All Wheel Protectant was recommended to me by my service advisor at Audi to protect the wheels from break dust and other contaminants.  This product is amazing!  Works Great!  Wheels stay much cleaner and the dirt practically just rinses off.  Cleaning the wheels is a snap now.  I don't know why more stores don't carry it.  So I stock up with a few cans from Amazon.  You've got to try it!
B005A8JDG4|5|Fits and works. Check and replace often, folks. Cheap insurance against ruining your blower motor or blow motor resistor.
B0059RCXJU|5|Good quality product  and looks great.
B0050SF35Y|1|Had it on for two weeks before it completely stopped opening. Worked great when it did. But the motor is too weak. I disassembled it to check it out. There is a t at the end of the motor and the door has a slot for it. Around the exit port the are spring loaded ball bearings that the door slides on. I can see scratches on both sides of the door where it gets stick. Can't tell if the bearings are too strong for the door our the motor isn't strong enough.
B0087NB6D2|1|This product originally worked very well.  Using it with the Sena SM10 Bluetooth Transmitter, I was able to stream stereo music from my factory sound system on my Honda Goldwing to my bluetooth helmet headset (Sena SMH-10).  BUT - After owning this for less than a month, I started to get static and a channel dropping out.  I could move the DIN connector attached to the motorcycle and the channel would come back and then drop again.  When I tried to unplug the connector from the motorcycle, the cable separated from the connector.  A good connection requires a good electrical bond and a good mechanical bond.  The electrical bond was fair.  The mechanical bond was non-existent.  As you can see from the photo, the cable pulled loose from the connector as there was no mechanical bond.  There is also no point to safely grip the connector when you want to disconnect from the bike.  The concept works great.  It just needs durability.  Amazon would not accept this as a return past 30 days.
B0055HVS9A|3|$$$ PRICE  $$$$ is the biggest issue here - nearly $500.00 dollars !!!!! please - but they ALL jack the price on these types of fenders, so there are not that many choices unless you do the right thing and go metal, which is a lot more work.  Installation , for me , was tricky, and I'm considered mechanically sound.  They're OKAY but that price hurts, for the cost you'd expect free replacement for life -- dream on -- BTW, if you scuff or Knick and you have dull patch, just hit the spot MOMENTARILY with propane torch and rub a bit when still warm, shined right up.....I'd give 4 stars if they sold for ~$200.00 and they installed without the need for  customization (if i installed again, i would know the alteration to make it easier) In my Opinion - the mounting of these needs new improved method. I don't DARE lean on them. When installed they provide more clearance and look pretty good .....
B000NE7TJ8|5|Invaluable!! I break several of these every time I take a door panel off. This is the best price on Amazon at the moment.
B00K9B9K6K|5|Thick material with a nice, vibrant graphic. The adhesive is high quality and sticks well.
B00K8VQE7Y|5|I'm 24 years old and I bought this.  No shame.  It looks cool and fits just right in my Toyota Corolla 2014.
B00681BE2S|5|Works great!
B00BTLDO4S|4|Fit great, just didn't come with any bolts or glue to hold it on
B008SDK7HM|5|I was having 2000 pounds of books brought into my space and we needed this 1 inch ramp to get in the garage... I added a little wood bracing under it as it's only rated for 600lbs. Worked GREAT and saved hours of labor.
B004IYY8SY|5|Installed after I got check engine light code P1457 on Honda Accord 2001 V6. The item is located below the vehicle (driver side, approximately below the rear seats) mounted on the EVAP canister. In my case the valve was all rusted, which seems to be a common problem with these units. Due to rust it was difficult to separate the valve from the canister, so I ended up replacing the EVAP canister also. Now 2 months after installation the check engine stays clear.
B000C80AGY|5|Seems to be working on my 2005 TDI Passat, BHW engine. Make sure you buy an oring  type gasket, it doesn't come with one
B007TWOOGI|5|This seat riser kit was the best 25 bucks I ever spent on my 2004 wrangler. I used to drive a '97 wrangler and remembered the ride height was perfect, then when I got a 2004 wrangler it felt like i was driving on the floor the seat was so low. I did some quick googling to see if anybody else had this issue of the seats being too low, and it brought me to these seat risers as a solution to my problem. I received my order from Fat Bob's Garage super quick and got to installing the risers the next day. Everything i needed was included in the kit except for the socket wrenches and T50 torx bit. Only one of the bolts gave me a hard time to losen up as it was rusty, but after I got that lose installation was a breeze and took about a half hour. This kit dramatically improved my ride and the overall feeling of driving, instead of peering up over the steering wheel I'm actually at a level up where I can see everything over the jeep's hood which in turn makes me feel like I can see the road a lot better. I highly recommend this kit to anyone with a '03 - '06 wrangler who wants a better ride height.
B00Q7DQW9M|5|Awesome product
B00480J4QY|5|Although there is a blueish tint to the bulbs, thankfully there is NO BLUE to the actual light output which is what I want for reduced eyestrain on longer trips. Definitely a lot more light with these new bulbs but I also replaced lenses so your mileage may vary.
B002PQOFOO|5|These corner lights are great just as good as original equipment fast shipping great price
B000CF6S0O|4|I would give this 5 stars, except it had 2 serious flaws, in my opinion. The plastic is lightly smoked and the sun still comes through much more than I wanted. I spray painted the inside with flat black spray paint until it was opaque. 2. The rear windows visors have no tape on the rear vertical sides and they bend in enough to stop the window from going up, because it hits them. Even when I bought Gorilla double sided tape, they still stuck into the window channel enough to stop the window from going up. Solution: I used a tin snips to cut the lower corner at a 45 degree angle so it starts outside the window channel and forces the glass to push the visor out enough to slide up.
B005C5CDOY|5|Excellent product. Very well made and protects your prop and any compartment you may store it in. Highly recommend it.
B00OXZE4SC|5|Excellent
B00B0DGRF8|5|Hubby loves them - HUGE SOA fan!
B002DU3TTO|5|It works.
B00189BJI4|1|Did not fit with dusterdeck from besttop.....one was zipper and the other tube/grove (like the tailgate bar).....returned (thank you Amazon for making that process EASY!)
B004HIZJ5W|4|Very cute and blingy but the metal frame hits my car as I hit bumps. Nosey.
B000B8UPM4|5|Very good sandpaper. Long lasting.
B00CGTVCIC|5|Great Value.  No odd smell.  Installed quickly to bring life to an 15 year old steering wheel. Easy, Easy, Easy!
B003UTH088|5|Works great. Programming was very simple as was stated in a previous review. delivered on time.
B00IEKOE8M|5|Easy to install, looks great, most of all, they increases braking...
B0002I94CK|5|got what i wanted and very happy with it
B00HYK7J6W|4|Great deal
B00429NKWK|5|If you are looking for a quick and inexpensive way to restore your headlights, this is the product for you! In less than an hour I completely restored the headlights on my car. On my last car I restored the lights on I had it done at a national chain and it cost me $100. I think this kit worked better on this car than the professionals did on my last car. This product was worth every penny, and I would recommend to all my friends!
B00INBV0KM|4|Decent ramps, light weight with a good weight rating.
B00JCYLK9K|1|1.  I think it is interferring with the efficiency of my cell phone<br />2.  Too big and gets in the way of functiions
B00MBNOHW6|5|Real authentic German parts.I was a tad skeptical with the price but it's just a deal!
B000AL8VD2|4|Works great and enough for two or three plug / wire / coil replacements on Ford V-8s. My only gripe is that the cap cracked after my second session using, likely not a big deal but the plastic on the cap is not strong so don't tighten it down or drop it as it won't survive.
B007Y86KTG|4|For the money you get no arguments out of me, it works!
B007Q8LVFC|5|very nice i like it !
B004QMFFZI|4|Gloves came in quick and are good quality, happy with my purchase.
B0037R8I8E|4|Pads work great!
B006LLB2UE|5|It's a dipstick...
B006WQSD1O|5|Product shipped and delivered quickly, packaging was very secure. Hub bear was as described, excellent product and would recommend these for anyone with 97-03 Grand Prix GT. awesome product and would buy from sealer again!
B004IU44PA|5|as advertised...  Nice quality product
B00QR64YV2|4|Easy installation, perfect fit, performance has been excellent, zero complaints
B000Z0HVHA|5|Soft rubber outer coating so its easy to wind back up.  Male/Female ends appear to be attached well.  Used it and worked without any trouble.  Connections will pull out easily if tugged on, which is a good thing so no damage takes place pulling wires out.
B00IKMBXY2|4|instructions were lacking on the installation. once figured out it works as advertised.
B000B5H1W4|2|Does not fit blue plastic 55 gallon drums. Threads are wrong size.  Don't know if it will fit a metal drum
B001GJ3FIS|1|A week after i got this it stopped working properly. I had to go to Home Depot to get another.
B007G2KKAU|3|Arrived and did not even unfold-- takes up a lot of room-- was not looking for something that takes up more room than most of our other car camping gear combined
B00JIW956Q|5|Made to fit no drilling
B00DKDFVVC|4|First time I have used it and it seems to do the job.
B000NJH5LU|5|Perfect fit for the E92, and keeps the sun out.
B00QW3N7TK|5|Worked perfect to fix my car
B0031XULF2|4|Seams to work--Hasn't been tested.
B001DAEEXU|1|It was a bad bearing.  Had to send it back, no problems with return.
B004QXRA00|5|It was the exact one I needed. Good stuff!!<br /><br />Thanks
B00RW8560M|4|Fast delivery on a Sunday.  The cover looks to made of good material and is soft on the inside.  Perfect for my little Honda 125s.  I would recommend this product.
B002J49OW0|2|Went through car was once and zebra print washed off
B00ENTD9MU|5|My Son loved these
B00GBQ771C|4|Good product.  Good price.
B00Z802SWA|5|Kit was complete, fit and function were perfect.  It would have been nice to know it was coming in two separate packages, but that was not enough of a problem to warrant concern.
B00OU6QDP6|5|Thanks for all.
B00NPAKZDE|4|Works great pretty loud good sound
B00GUPMHWI|5|boat to use in the head of my sailboat.  Works great to cover smells that seem to live in &#34;heads&#34;.
B002IBFUNG|5|Will buy more!
B000J3ZUTY|5|Great for our truck you can feel the difference went you don't used it because the truck get super hot but went we put it up if those keep the sun out
B00MFXSEZI|2|I don't do to many reviews, but figured I had to state that I was displeased with this product. I had the cheap metal one for $30 before and they worked great until the screws popped out one day and they fell off. I thought this would be much nicer and more secure as they were 3 times the price.<br /><br />The only positive I can say is that they did install much easier than the other set I had. Unfortunately, these are made of cheap plastic parts and I can tell they will not survive more than 12 months of use. They snap in place with a somewhat flimsy design. Further, because of their cheap plastic material they vertical bars look like junk. Definitely not worth the $90+ I spent. I would recommend the metal cheaper ones way over these.
B00UNRUJ7E|3|I bought this for my wrangler so I could throw it up when it rains. It's mostly water resistanc but it does leak through the seams
B002G225TE|5|it works
B009XOTRBM|5|Worked as advertised. Excellent shipping time frame. Would recommend.
B009TOIO0G|5|Fast shipping, cheap price, great product
B007H2Q6ZC|5|Bought this for my 87 year old mother to be able to get in and out of a SUV.  Very sturdy!  Much better than a plastic step stool and wide enough to turn around on.  The yellow also matches my sister's new Jeep.
B00VJDP84U|5|Very good product, nice light
B005FG28K4|5|Work great with with fire and ems
B007V2DH2S|4|it's good
B00062YUUS|1|Recieved the meter and it does not work. None of the functions are working.
B0014BCFC0|5|Universal and seems like a fairly solid filter, especially for the price.  The overall flow through the filter seems perfect.
B000EFCPOK|5|Seems to be holding up well
B002FUR452|5|Good gain in Horse power and the intake sounds really good. Installation a little more than an hour.Love It!!!!
B0034ZYE5U|5|Great winch would buy it again !!!!!  had no trouble installing it on my arctic cat prowler 1000  GOOD BUY for the money  Thanks.
B00JSJMV38|5|Finally found a steering wheel cover that fit my mini! great service.
B0016LE80K|4|Just what we needed for the wife's car. The single outlet wasn't enough for 2 items, and this fits the bill.

B00KTIXJO2|5|perfect color match my truck
B005FFDC7S|5|Great item... Arrived fast!!!
B006T08WXM|5|Why spend all the money on a high-performance car and then cheap out on a cheap oil filter.  Only the best for my scatpack
B00067KQGK|3|Well made.  But heavy.

B000CISLUG|3|The mirrors are quite difficult to adjust by yourself, and vibrate quite a bit, making it difficult to see out of.

B006YBBIGE|5|They were perfect.
B009FRTNHA|5|1998 K1500 Suburban The way stock brakes should have been. These pads are quiet and grip like a monster. I replaced a set of Wagner Thermo Quiet ceramic pads that had been in there around 2 years. They weren't worn out but they were heat cracked like crazy. I had just replaced the rear drums and shoes and the front brakes were not up to the task any longer.<br /><br />I also installed the Power Stop slotted/drilled rotors at the same time and this combination works incredibly well. The GMT400 platform is known for bad brakes but these make the 6000# truck stop on a dime. After 1500 miles I am impressed. They have awesome grip under light pedal and REALLY grip without fade on a hard stop.
B00327CY7U|5|sent it back did not fit
B00JBIRBYA|1|Read the note before buying. For cosmetic use only. Pretty color, too dim to see. Junk for most applications.
B007TG7IIK|1|Returned, though listed for my STS Cadillac, wiper is wrong size, returned for refund<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007TG7IIK Bosch 21OE-CA / 3397006513E7W Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 21&#34; (Pack of 1)]]
B004LQR6EW|5|Installed today and it works great. Easy to install. Valves are quick opening and closing, no need to turn the handles a lot.
B00F6XAO6G|5|Perfect fit, thick but not too overly heavy.. had Dodge logo on the mat which was a nice surprise!  They don't send any mounting hardware to secure it (not really necessary if you have a camper shell) but I did drill and put about 6 screws to secure it to the the bed.. very happy with this mat...
B003PVPSIK|5|Awesome product, thank you and will definitely buy more products
B001O4CIHY|4|Pricey but better than the junk from Harbor Freight.
B005NLQAHS|5|Purchased to use for all vehicles, but specifically to play with the OBD2 settings of my 2015 Audi S4.  communicates easily with my Galaxy s4 and works very well with Carista app.  I'll try torque later on. Tried 2 other lower priced scan tools that didn't work well at all, very glad I tried this one next.
B000VU56Z8|5|Fits great. Rugged. Great product
B003YLIHKW|5|Quick fix to my Jeeps Fan. Check the wiring before ordering if a wire is burnt order Dorman 973-416 it includes a repair kit for the harness including connectors.
B00BTK6GKS|5|My truck definitively sounds louder and seems to have some gains.  I had someone help me put it on since the instructions were retarded and not detailed enough for me.  Looks good under the hood and sounds good.
B0085IJVBI|5|Fit on the first try, and was super easy to install. I believe it will last longer than the original thanks guys.

B00D9C2CDO|4|Did Everything It Was Supposed To, Was Waterproof On a 12 Hour Rainy Trip To Canada used it To Put Camping Chairs and Spare Tire On<br />Was Easier Than Putting Tiedowns

B007TY4YES|5|Great cost, timely shipping, easy swap out!
B0049Z6VQE|5|Great deal & part.
B00B9H590E|3|Fit was perfect. Wish the handle was chrome plated steel instead of plastic.
B00G620ZVU|5|For $25 they are great lights, i put them on the grill of my pickup and they look great they are brighter than my headlights and my headlights are very bright. Also I went through the car wash and no water got into them. I would buy these again in a heartbeat!
B000COC7ZU|5|works great

B0058I82SG|5|I'm really happy with this product.
B0021YZER2|4|Although Driven Extreme Duty Glass Cleaner has its usefulness, if you are expecting something that simply melts away hard water stains and mineral deposits this may not be the ticket. Calling the manufacturer I believe what they are recommending this be used with are Scotch Brite &#34;blue&#34; pads which generally have a sponge on the opposite side of a woven abrasive surface. They cautioned NOT to use green pads which will scratch glass very easily. I found that even the blue pad will leave fine scratches on glass unless only very light pressure is applied. After experimenting with application pressures I was able to remove hard water stains from glass shower doors with minimal scratching. The description for Driven Glass Cleaner also suggests it has other uses in the bathroom such as porcelain sinks and toilets. I found this to be wishful thinking unless quite a bit of force is applied which I could have done with or without this product. One reviewer suggests letting it sit on the surface for 30 minutes before scrubbing so I'll try that next time.On the positive side nothing else seemed to work on our shower doors and a little goes a long way. For $20 though I had expected much more of a chemical action rather than an abrasive.
B0054T95ZS|5|Good
B00QPV8B22|5|These are bigger than I thought they would be. Also the bristles are very stiff, which was nice. Using one in my car, for brushing off snow, etc. Using the other one to brush off furniture, etc.
B00FBPWO0S|5|This mat is perfect for camping. Just the right size.
B00JIE3786|5|Nice. Quality vinyl, applies cleanly, and looks sharp, especially on my grey car.
B0049YKMV0|5|ok
B00NTC76T4|5|Works great
B0048SKOYW|5|A direct fit for my 2004 Triumph Sprint st 955 and quickly delivered.  I wish EBC included a sticker.
B0006N5S6C|1|leaks like sieve when emptying tanks because there is actually just a rubber seal on one side (the side that's visible).
B004M3F5CO|5|Best label remover!
B000CIRR8I|2|It may be okay for which it was designed, I don't know.  I intended to use it as a cross bar to mount a wind deflector.  Turns out I would have had to buy an additional kit that requires drilling into the vehicle.  I returned it for that reason.
B006QXX1FG|4|I've used this in my vehicle for the dome of it, have only come across a issue with manufacturing where it is very nimble and can bend on you as the connectors to the power are soldered on to the PCB/Board and aren't supported elsewhere, maybe a aluminum plate or such on the back would help with supporting and even heat dissipation as a bonus. But once you've had it inplace you wont have any issueds, have had it installed in my 91 Honda Accord for well over three months without issues, and have had one installed in a 2007 Scion TC also without issues.
B00I8IPCM2|5|Fits my 2014 Ford Fusion great. Slid right in and was relatively easy to do. It took about 30 minutes.
B000ONZTS6|5|Pretty decent quality, have to say I am happy with these. Good fit, I have the oem of these and they are hard to tell the difference.
B0016IABBI|5|What can I say it works just fine.
B00WDRU6C0|3|reset switch x 1 = this is a momentary switch
B00065JM8U|5|It does a good job
B010B3PG9K|3|The bottom connection points are not in the same location for the 2015 RAV4 as depicted. The picture is likely an early model. I jury-rigged it to work but it's not ideal.
B007HRICH2|4|The MOR/ryde kit was a fairly easy install on my 2004 Montana 5th wheel. Having never worked on a suspension before, I took my time to figure the best way to line up the springs and components. Of course, the second side was easier and faster. I did the entire job in one day with no assistance and no prior experience so that has to say something about ease of installation.  I did have to remove two of the greaseable bolts and turn the grease hole to the down position because I could not get grease to flow. These bolts had been partially pre-assembled at the factory. They were not in the position as recommended by the instruction sheet. I contacted MOR/ryde by email with questions and they responded immediately.  They were very easy to contact and helpful with one exception. When I asked about the position of the partially pre-assembled bolts, they recommended that I leave them as received. I would have saved a small amount of time if I would have turned them as the instruction sheet recommended. Overall, very happy with the product and customer service. I rated 4 stars because I want to see how easily they grease after being used for a time.  If they grease easy and no problems show up, I would rate 5 stars.
B0002UHVAA|5|Works great
B007V2E9CA|5|Fits perfect. Easy to fold up when not using.
B00496RE82|5|This has been an awesome pump.  I put it in my old truck when the mechanical pump failed.  Once I replaced the mechanical pump, it was very easy to remove.<br /><br />One of our cars got a bad tank of gas (car wouldn't start after filling it).  Used this pump with great caution to completely drain the 11 gallons.<br /><br />I then recently used it to pump old fuel out of a truck and a car, both which had been sitting 5-10 years.  Worked fantastic, and the pump still continues to work!  This pump has been a workhorse for all the &#34;dirty&#34; jobs that just need to get done and it doesn't need to be anything fancy.
B007512CRQ|5|Very good quality, good price and fast service. Second pair of mirrors I've ordered from Magazi and I've been pleased with both.
B008HUH0EO|4|But it was to large for my application on my Tenere.<br />Shock bottoms out and slams into the front fender.
B0041U61HG|5|love
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Very nice heavy duty ramps that are wide enough to feel comfortable.  They are light weight to make it easy to load and unload the ramps, but are strong enough for my Grizzly 700. They are well made and even include a security strap to hook on the pickup so that the ramps can't slide off.  I highly recommend this product, especially for the price.  A great value.
B00COORY9U|1|Did not work. Tried contacting seller and haven't heard anything from then!!! Product feels cheap and didnt work and the customer service is crap try another kit
B00YDUT4D2|4|No instructions, pretty simple to figure out. Did not fix my turbo, but prob the turbo not the kit.
B010J85NU4|5|I love them and the cause!!!
B004GE5FJM|5|Got here faster than I thought A+
B00GU0OKIW|4|A little oversized lengthwise, had to buy double-sided tape for addit iona mounting points.
B0013V6M7U|5|Well made, easy install. People comment a lot.
B00Y9LPP4W|5|fantastic
B00IPS4APU|1|I give zero stars. I opened this product to do my repair and find out there is no resin in the sealed raisin bottle. Since I was busy the last month I kept this product for a later date. And now I can't return it. So I thought that the resin leaked. I tried scraping inside of the cover with the blade provided, there was none. Some of these packages have empty bottles so look out when u buy these.
B00NRLCJPI|2|Quality good.  Screws are not enough could not use.
B00PT18QAQ|5|very good heavy duty construction, feels great in the hand ,swivel on valve stem for easy use, also can hold pressure reading until released, truly a professional grade instrument.
B000MF6HZA|5|Great for hiking on hot day
B00NJJ0NPG|3|As LED's they are great. But for use in modern vehicles not so great. The newer systems do not recognize the LED bulbs presence so they blink twice as fast as normal unless a resistor is instaled. Even then if they are part of the lights, and there is a normal bulb anywhere in the light circuit when they are on @ nite the resistors don't work, they again blink twice as fast. Recommended. Only buy LED's with built-in resistor, or, make sure all lites in that circuit are LEDs with resistors on at least one LED in thst circuit.
B0039HF3SU|4|installed as auxillary lighting for trips in the woods. work great. not as bright as the KC HiLites but I knew that since they were only 55watts.
B00CLSX1EQ|3|I received valve quickly but had to modify connections. I haven't had time to check how it works yet and will update this post when I do. I would recommend this product.
B00BMEAQ7U|3|Nice quality but part did not fit correctly on my 2002 Audi tt also had to plug extra inlet hole on it and make adapter to fit correctly in all nice part for the price
B006FUT0CS|1|Nothing special about it. There are other products that do a better job for the price.
B00736AEBO|5|Great fit at a Great price
B006L76RXU|5|Excellent
B00MAWH2PM|5|Got this for my daughter, the ultimate NBC fan.  Just hope no one steals it like her Micky one.  Good quality and cute.
B0013HZOO6|5|This sunshade really fits well and the car is much less hot when I use it.  It was worth it to buy one made for the smart fortwo!
B001B1A5YI|5|Worked great for me no more oil on the driveway. Thank you.
B001AVSIOI|5|Well manufactured product. I can tell by the weight that's it's a solid product.
B00MOMADZY|5|These were perfect for extending the buckles so my small children can buckle themselves more easily.
B00BSCFETQ|4|Does a great job of dimming especially when the Sun is low and shining directly into my face while driving through a curve.
B003M6D15A|5|We have a 2012 F350 Lariat with the moon roof and these installed with no problems, and no leaks even after going through a car wash.  We spliced them into the stock wiring using the harness that was included in the kit and drills and a step bit to make the needed holes in the truck.  We also used some silicon caulk on the rubber gasket just to be sure it'd be water tight.  With the moon roof you just need to move them forward about 1/2 inch from what the instructions say.  Google for some tips on the install before you start, and measure everything twice, but it is very doable.  Total time to install was about 3-4 hours.
B00DYA43Y2|4|👍👍👍👍
B0024E71X4|5|Have used these for quite some time now and they work well. They were easy to install for even the most inexperienced person with tools.
B000Z0HVHA|4|Handy
B00IVP0U56|5|This jacket and it's price is outstanding in every way! I was super surprised when I opened the package. I was.a little hesitant when I ordered the XL size, but it fit me like like it was custom made.for me. The zip-out liner is a very nice plus.<br />All in all, I rate this jacket as a fantastic buy!!
B00JJ8LCQA|4|No problem at all fairly easy to install and looks great,and has a great ride I'm very happy.
B00FC22SII|5|From day one these HID for Innovited has been rock solid !<br />I really enjoy the extra beams and distance they add to driving .
B000CODE0M|5|Works as Described and for closed or multi prong Spark Plugs
B00GJ1GL3E|5|Very good economical replacement. Highly Recommended.
B005Z8HAUK|3|I bought this to keep in my truck for airing and de-airing my tires when towing and not towing. It does fine for two of my tires taking them from 65PSI to 80PSI. As soon as I start the 3rd tire it usually cuts itself off with the temp protection and I have to wait a bit to finish. It does get the job done, but having the inconvenience of waiting 30 minutes or so for it to cool off between sides of my truck is obnoxious.
B00U8O69AS|5|Great product
B004O7CC3S|1|The pictures shows and says the tie down pieces are included? I did NOT reciece the tie doen pieces!!!.
B000K02EDG|3|Got a bad sensor and had to pay for labor twice.  Amazon reimbursed me for the second round of labor which was nice but it was ultimately very inconvenient
B0036GGFV8|4|Carries everything I need for a good few hour ride.  You can pack little bit of clothes & toiletries in here if you stay the night somewhere for a single night.  Hard case side pockets hold a good amount of small things like tools or keys or cell accessories. Looks good on the tail too!<br />Highly Recommended!
B0055QG6XY|5|Arrived quickly and fits great!
B0033QO022|5|good product
7138258879|5|Looks great on my car not alot of people know my car is a sohc
B002EVWDNU|5|Thank you very much :)
B00AO2CWJQ|3|They go on my thin frames well, but have to be positioned at the very end of the frame to get behind my ear. They work well when on, the glasses don't slide, but I have short hair and feel nerdy wearing them; a clear material would make them less noticeable. I ride a motorcycle and they were a little uncomfortable with the helmet on, which is understandable since it pushes on my ears a bit for a snug fit. I could remove them and put them back on, but I don't like having to do that. I've decided to only wear them when I I expect to be bending over (e.g. working around the house or car), which makes them much less useful than I had hoped would be the case. I've ordered shrink tubing and will see if that works well enough for an all time solution.
B00OZYHOE2|4|Good goggles if you have a small nose bridge. I gave them to my wife because I can't wear them.
B0045LA0MS|2|Probably my fault for not cross referencing part number's, but it's not the filter displayed in the picture.
B000VEF3ZW|5|AVS alway the best way to go don't buy that  cheep crap the dealer or the auto parts stores might try to sell you. Tell them you want AVS. Had them on every car Ive bought door vents hood protector and wind shield for the sun roof.
B00W8LQHBU|5|Good product will buy again if ever needed.
B008QHSRR2|3|The trueno isn't accurate to the initial D trueno but it still looks good
B00IV5TH96|3|Fast delivery. So far, glow plugs working ok. Good price! I would recommend these!
B00M42CLXQ|5|The bars look great and are simple to install. For my 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 it was just a matter of installing 6 brackets, 2 bars, and tightening 24 bolts and I was finished. I selected these because of the reviews and the pictures. I noticed other Nerf bars brands had reviews where people complained the bars have an angle once installed and don't look straight. The way the brackets are designed on these you have room to adjust the bars so they will be straight when tightened and they'll look great.
B007WWU79S|5|Good Stuff
B001GH3QSO|5|Exactly what I needed for my 2002 Ford F-150. Was pretty simple to install, and holds up very well. Been on my truck for about a month ago and it settles in nicely.
B00030CYMY|5|Great
B007V2BCCK|5|I got this for my Mazda CX-9 & it fits perfectly. It's very sturdy, well made,  easy to put up and take down. I highly recommend it. It's worth the price!
B00D2ZT0FQ|5|The quality is amazing. Can't wait to get this on my trike!
B00MEVO5U4|3|Cute but don't cover all of the thread.
B00EUI00KS|5|My boyfriend is embarrassed to be seen getting out of my car, but I think this magnet is hilarious.  It's large, well-printed, and stays in place on my car.
B000786GLM|5|super stuff---fixed a leak in a stainless steel water tank---perfect
B00FH8P1DG|5|For the price, it can't be beat.
B00HWI2S9O|5|LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY'RE PERFECT, NOW I CAN GET IN THE TRUCK WITHOUT A LADDER.
B0081LUPI2|5|Abdolutely Love this helmet!!!  &#34;It won't look goofy on me.&#34;  Heehee
B00CFQUKTS|5|Perfect Fit for a 1997 Buick LeSabre.  It is actually better than the original ones on the car! Simple, no fuss, great composite rubber.<br />I wanted a smooth ride for my daily ride and this did the trick and secured nicely.
B003E7NZR6|2|I just received the Rugged Ridge Black Diamond Soft Top Cover for my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and had fitment issues.  Although Amazon said it would fit my 4 door unlimited as well as a 2 door, I went ahead with the order with some hesitation.  Yes, the back of these 2 jeep models are basically the same, but the tops have a significant difference in material to cover.  The box that I received said it was for a 2 door model, which had me worried.  Also, the top itself had a label that said it was for a 2 door wrangler....so this made me wonder if there is another top made especially for 4 door models...if not, why label it this way if they fit both?  Well my concerns regarding fit were real.  This &#34;2 door&#34; top is not large enough to cover all the fabric of a 4 door top.  It is just not possible to tuck the cover into the body frame rails at each corner.  You can get one side down, but it's just not long enough horizontally to reach the other side, nor does it seem to be tall enough.  Letting it sit in the sun won't solve the problem either...it's just too small.  I did my very best to fold the top as efficient as possible to make sure it would compress as low as possible too, but it didn't help.  I'm sad, because it is a very nice cover that zips up to wrap the entire top and also fits into the stock tail gate rail.  If only it was an inch taller and maybe 2 inches wider.  Also, regarding color, most people say it's black, but I would say it's dark gray when compared to the stock Mopar soft top.  It's very slight and it's not a big issue since they will never be seen at the same time together.  Unfortunately I'm sending it back for a refund.
B00GM4WKJM|5|Perfect fitting, love the color, this was well wrapped, and easy to open thanks Thanks
B00XULDAWG|3|Good
B00BN44BCU|5|Pefect, Fast delivery. really nice honda original product just what I was looking for.
B00WDY9X9U|4|I purchased these for the rear bench seat of my 2015 Ram quad cab. The material is thin but flexible. Had no problem with tearing and it fit just fine. This cover has been designed to deal with average wear and tear. It is not water resistant. Might want to consider that if this is for a work vehicle. I didn't use the head rest covers. All after market covers look like grocery sacks to me. I would recommend watching the short YouTube video on how to install the cover properly. Very helpful. For the price if you're looking for light to medium duty seat covers, these will do the trick.
B009OBW29S|5|Excellent wax for my black Infiniti.  Easy to use and brilliant shine.
B00076WQDG|5|Worked perfectly !!
B006ZDXHCY|4|Really a nice balance. completes the overall look of my 2002 limited
B006OQ35GU|4|Like
B000143LHY|5|Ozium rocks!  I've used it for years.  It really does eliminate odors - not just mask them.  Plus, there is no sickly sweet smell that is added to many air fresheners.  Highly recommend!
B00CIJ7M6G|5|I love it!
B001N0E188|5|excellent as described
B00YI3IGA6|5|This is everything I hoped it would be!  It's super easy to put on or take off the car and keeps the sun off my little one much better than the old shade it replaced.  I put the window down and my daughter loved the fresh air!  I highly recommend this!
B001PYV4CS|3|This Dorman wheel cylinder placed the (2) mounting holes too far apart. I had to oversize my backing plate through holes by 3/64 of an inch to allow for the screws to thread in. I am disappointed in the quality of this product and the work around that I was required to do to get the car functioning. This is the 3rd set of wheel cylinders on this car so I know it should have worked with no issues.
B00HSSZ84K|5|Perfect match!
B00SQ2GEJA|4|We installed the Unit our selves and it has performed as expected.
B002NBSQ78|5|2003 Pontiac Vibe.  Lined up just like OEM one. Car moves and car shifts perfectly fine.<br /><br />When I dropped the pan, I had about 5 quarts of transmission fluid come out. Just a heads up when your buying http://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Toyota-Automatic-Transmission-Type-4/dp/B009W391PQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1439090216&sr=1-1&keywords=toyota+transmission+fluid you know how much to buy
B00R5J2G8I|1|edges are very sharp and chrome sucks!
B0009JKIRC|3|It leaves a great shine, and has a distinction &#34;wet&#34; look when buffed. It honestly looks great.<br /><br />However, it is one of the more difficult to apply waxes I've used. It stains black trim, and if you put it on just a little too thick, it requires some serious elbow grease to buff off. I typically use something much easier on the rest of the car, and save Zymol for just the hood. Its too much of a pain to use in the whole car.
B000COS07O|3|This size McGard is for 1 ton 8-lug pickup trucks typically with a diesel.  If you have stock rims, then you have a Center Cap covering the axel and lug nuts. This center cap has to be pounded on extremely hard with a rubber mallet because the McGard lock is a far different shape than a standard lug nut.  It does fit, but give it a few weeks and watch the Center Caps all fall off.  Net-net, if you are going to use the McGard locks, make sure you have after market tires.  Without the Center Cap, the rims and axel looks like hell.
B00XAX4B9A|5|I bought two of these sunshades and they both fit perfectly in my wife's 2009 Toyota Corolla and my 2005 Ford Escape. We watched instructional videos on how to fold them back up and still don't have the hang of it entirely and it might take a couple of tries twisting and turning this thing until it wraps itself up six times or so, but once it does it's very compact and convenient so it's worth it. It comes with an attached strap to secure it together and a storage case if it's going to be put away for a while. Blocks the sun's damaging rays and heat coming through the windshield.  Would recommend this product.
B007LQPCY0|5|They fit my bf's truck perfectly and were great quality. He loved them!
B00CYUOFYQ|5|Bolted right up like claimed and they give a nice look to the suspension. Holding up so far (installed for about 2 months)
B003BV5J24|5|Watch the video. Install was easy. Really like the product.
B008427D88|5|Came as described.  Good quality and they fit perfectly.
B0049Z2TTW|1|The part fit as advertised like original.
B002R4U72I|5|Works and looks excellent. It'd be nice to see some comparison temps but then I'd need an infrared thermometer. Easy install, just wear long sleeves since it's very similar to working with fiber glass.
B0019X04WG|5|Fit just as it should
B00B3YL3OY|4|Very happy with this bag. Looks great, lots of pockets. Zippers are sturdy and the main compartment expands if you need it. Photos, description and  dimensions were very accurate. Lots of straps for mounting and carrying. Perfect for my 400+ mile motorcycle trip. It didn't get 5 stars because the buckles are stiff and sometimes hard to open.
B001NYFOLC|4|So far so good. Works!
B004NH0MYU|5|oh man i didn't get to use this mask yet but i will be soon its so cool looking
B00K1C1WC2|5|I bought 2 sets, works as expected of course lol. Light weight which is important for rvs
B0056DFPM4|5|Very good quality sticker and exactly what I expected to receive. Looks great on my back window.
B006JJRLGW|4|I haven't installed these yet but when I lit one up, dang!
B0006MWPZU|4|They are just what I needed
B007KFNGM2|5|I purchased these for my 1998 4x4 K1500 Suburban in conjunction with a set of Z36 towing pads, also from Power Stop. I couldn't be happier after the first 1500 miles. I was so tired of the rusty nasty rotors and the odd wear of other aftermarket rotors. The zinc plating keeps the non wear areas rust free and the drilling keeps the rotors cooler which keeps them from warping.<br /><br />They stop smooth and steady in both regular and hard stops. One thing you need to be aware of is that during really hard stops, you will hear and feel some light oscillation (best I can describe it) as the pads cross the machined slots on the surface. Not sure if its the gasses escaping (reason for slots) or not but it's there. Either way, it's not an issue and you know things are working as intended. With the K36 pads there is no fade at all. In fact, they grip better when hot.
B009NMH70M|5|Fit as expected
B00FNWR58K|5|Very satisfied exactly as described am very pleased arrived very quickly
B000FW2MC2|4|works great
B000J47RYY|4|Fits good, wish it was able to cover the front of the glass. It drops in the middle. The visor is able to keep it up on the right and left side.
B00C5S5L9A|4|Good product and easy to install with the spring coil assembly set.
B002SW4VLW|5|Comes in handy in a pinch
B00AV9NBY2|3|It will do.
B0050HC39E|5|I wasn't sure what to expect for $20 but this bar turned out to be great. The coating seems to be some kind of plastic type enamel which is decently durable. I accidentally scraped some off somehow while I was installing it so be careful of that but I would say it was due to my carelessness and not the quality of the coating. Some people had trouble with the thickness of the coating especially on the throttle side of the bar. I didn't have any issues getting my throttle tube on the bar (I have a 1980 GS550) but I did have to drill a small hole to accommodate the metal locking tab that keeps my throttle tube from sliding on the bar. Overall I really like the bar and I would buy another.
B00L1SGT3W|5|Really nice keychain!
B000BZJ9Q0|5|It works very good, high quality !!!!
B002IV8I80|5|Great item to hold spare tire on trailer. Allows for easy removal with any tools and nice feature being able to lock spare tire.
B0085FOPC6|1|One head light was fine. The other one the first night after installing, moisture got inside and have not been able to get it out.
B0043879Y0|3|This light is amazingly bright for a solar powered light. Our main problem is that the sensor does not always detect motion, but we do have an unusual installation which may contribute to this. When that happens, I usually hit the switch and manually turn on. My only wish is that it would stay on a little longer, if needed.
B00V7DWZT8|5|Luv it..
B00F937C7M|5|Good quality bulbs included and clips didn't break like cheap ones when you pop them in
B000CQRLWC|2|Have started squealing after 60 days
B001UPYW1W|1|I expected so much more from This being a feature manufacturer. I installed with all hard connections and heat shrink and sealed connectors and internal thermostat option directly in manifold. I adjusted so it only came on after factory fans came on with a 185 Tstat and it lasted exactly one month. I've checked all power and fuses (main as well as key on power On connection) and it's just dead. There's power to it on all connections and ground is direct To batt and it's just dead. Flexalite is a joke.
B00AYVQ01S|5|Absolutely love this mount, it looks great and fit my 12,000 lb Smittybilt X2O winch perfectly. Shipping was quick and it arrived in perfect condition. I highly recommend. Seller was quick to reply to my e-mails as well. Overall, I am extremely satisfied!!!<br /><br />Update: As of 2/21/2016 I have since added a 22&#34; led light bar and all weather outlet so I can easily plug into my truck block heater. I have posted pics of the set up which I really like. If you have any questions about anything, please feel free to e-mail me at losky24@yahoo.com.
B00KGGTF9U|2|I have an suv and I measured the windshield before ordering, but this jumbo size shade was just not large enough too be held up by the visors.  It seemed to be a little short of the advertised measurements.
B00CIVI6JQ|4|Fits and works. I'll withhold the fifth star until I have some durability data. (I'm an engineer!)
B008PSOBI6|5|Best combo out ther for Mercedes ceramic paint! It's like the corket and tubs of sealing and polish!
B0012FKF9S|5|These party light holders are great!! I was using clothes pins and constantly having to adjust. Remove hooks before rolling awning in and make sure that grommets are dry (they dry quickly) - to prevent rust issues. I have only had them a month and so far no rust issues. Handy RV lighting product. Shipped quickly.
B00UCMATTS|5|Perfect re emplacement for my old Axle in my Manitou  Fork, delivery on time,
B00HFWY4HQ|4|My husband who rides motorcycles loves this for our scooter.  Whatever visor issues the other reviews spoke of have clearly been fixed.  The Large was a little small, but the XL proves to be a micro-tad bigger than he wishes.... but hardly noticeable to anyone, including my husband.  Great value.
B0002UHVAA|5|Seems to be very good quality. Time will tell how it holds up
B000H94F6E|5|This charger is lighweight and charged my son's battery.
B00PV37ZEA|5|I have a subcompact hybrid without a lot of storage or space.  I looked at about 20 different containers before choosing this one for its size, price and features.  This container fits neatly on the passenger side floor up against the center column, and the top snaps shut so that if I have a passenger, they can't even tell that it's garbage.  Well made, attractive, useful.  Although the basket is lined with something water proof, I use an old plastic bag inside to make it easy to pull the trash and empty.
B0006SU3QW|5|Work perfect
B00UKJQ960|5|Product was great !
B000CEE62W|5|This parking guide is working well, so far. It's not quite as heavy as the one I got from the Container store, but seems to be holding up well. I really have no complaints about the quality or functionality of this item. Would recommend.
B003TU6066|4|BRIEF: This cheap stuff definitely can make your car quieter... but not by much.  for some frequencies of road noise, it will decrease the noise by as much as 2-3 decibels (going by instinct, not audiometer).  on other road surfaces, this will do very little.<br /><br />but, i'm happy with this product, and plan to buy more.<br /><br />SEMI-BORING DETAILS: i know very little about cars.  i know even less about craftsmanship.  i don't even know if i could put 2 nails in a wall so i could hang up a painting straight.<br /><br />i have a very mild case of hyperacusis.  in english, it just means that i am DARN sensitive to noise.  even causes pain, discomfort.  i hope no one laughs at me.  but if someone else does, go ahead.<br /><br />years ago, my previous car was a 2006 subaru wrx turbo with loud sports tires.  this was one of the loudest and least sound insulated production cars on the planet.  i think this car and it's daily noise attack was what cause my sensitivity to sound.  after 130,000 miles, and very worn and loud tires, i had to change out of it.<br /><br />but before i did, i bought the fatmat.  and, as fate would have it, my 9.5 year old car with 130k miles started having expensive problems.  had to disconnect from the wrx soon.<br /><br />only 2 months ago, i got a 2012 mazda 6 - which is an awesome car by the way.  so, i had spent about $60 on fatmat for my old car, then had to get rid of my old car before i could put the fatmat in.... now i have a &#34;newer&#34; car, that i was afraid to touch and alter its &#34;virginity&#34; or &#34;newer&#34; car status.<br /><br />.... couldn't take the road noise anymore.  so, with fat mat just sitting in my house for months (!), i decided one day to put it in soon.<br /><br />i called a bunch of people like mechanics and dealers and sound shops for estimates of how much $ to put this stuff in.<br />was told: &#34;just the trunk? $100&#34;,  &#34;whole car? hundreds&#34;<br /><br />ok, so i'm too lazy or scared (didn't want to mess up this gluey sticky stuff) to put it in myself. but i didn't want to give someone $100 to cut sheets of &#34;rubber&#34; and just press it into my car.<br /><br />so, i decided to do it myself.  was a little concerned: would it bend? would it stretch and mold to my car? can i take off the doors?<br /><br />so, i decided since i was lazy, and this was the first time i was ever going to do this, i thought (and read the internet) about what's the easiest place for a rookie to try?<br /><br />the trunk (no need to take panels off).<br /><br />sure, putting this stuff in the doors can block out a lot of wind noise.  putting it in the headliner does a lot too.  but to take off the door panels takes time, mild technical knowledge, labor.  and, ok, a rookie takes off the door panel and maybe even the headliner..... can he put them back?!<br /><br />WHAT I USED: flathead screwdrivers, sharp and big utility knife.  no ruler or measuring tape because i'm lazy...<br /><br />WHAT I DID: so, one summer day, after deciding that i'm not paying someone to put this stuff in, and going based on what i saw on internet videos, i drove to an empty parking lot far from anyone or traffic.  opened the fatmat box FIRST (open fm first and let it sit in sun while you get everyting else ready).  there are big sheets rolled into a multilayered rectangular prism (seemingly fitting a rectangular shipping box) with a small knife and easily breakable small rolling  pin.  also super simple instructions.<br /><br />i pulled everything out of my trunk: trunk mat, tools, spare tire.  i just left it on the ground away from me and the fm that was near me.  in the trunk, i just saw bare, flat metal.  and a big &#34;hole&#34; in the center with a cylinder sticking up.... where a spare tire goes.<br /><br />people say vacuum, primer.  yea, they're right - that would have done a better job.... but i'm lazy.  i just wiped the metal off with my hand and picked up big pieces of dust up threwit away.<br /><br />ok, so the fat mat is sitting in the sun for maybe 20-30 minutes on a hot summer day.  indeed, like other people say, this helps.  the mat will get more malleable, stickier, slightly easier to handle if you don't get your whole hand on the sticky side.... just use your fingertips if possible.<br /><br />so, i just minimally unroll the rectangulr prism a foot, then cut off a big piece where there is a mild bend [remember when you get this stuff, it will have been in a rectangular box for a while].  i just cut where there were creases/bends/sides were that conformed to edges of the shipping box.<br /><br /> then, i took off all the paper backing of that 3' by 1' piece i not professionally (but not raggedly) cut off.  take it to my car, look for some wide place i can put it down... then put it down straight horizontal or vertical.<br /><br />i also put a lot where the spare tire would be.  once the fm was partially on, i used a knife to slice the fm wherever it wasn't bending well.  then i just pressed it down.  was surprised i was able to get it on so well and that it stretched like the pedals of a flower.<br /><br />i pressed in with fingers.  then, i took the cheap rolling pin provided.  this plastic handle, metal shank, plastic roller broke in less than a minute.  i was indeed pressing hard, but the plastic stretched under the weight and force i was applying.  rolling thing broke off from metal handle.  tried to reattach the cylinder to the handle, tried to angle it when i rolled so it woul stay on.... this broken rolling pin turned out to be unhelpful at first.<br /><br />too lazy to go buy a new (better) one at home depot, i looked around, saw i had two screwdrivers.  i used the flat end of the screwdriver to start pressing the fatmat (fm) in.  i even used the sharp right angle of the screwdrivers to really &#34;slash&#34; and &#34;press&#34; this stuff into my trunk.  i knew since i had a metal surface under the fm, i couldn't do any damage.i even lightly stabbed the fm into the trunk.  my fmatted trunk may not look pretty, but i got it in and on tight....<br /><br />i did use the rolling pin a little... but it would always separate on me every 14 seconds.  super annoying.<br /><br />so, i repeated this process again and again for 2 hours.  unroll fm rectangular prism until i reach a 90 degree bend, use my own big utility knife to easily cut..... look for a good place to put it, press in with flat side of screwdriver.<br /><br />ONE MISTAKE i did make was putting in one piece, then pressing in so aggressively.  after 30 minutes, i figured out it would have been faster and possibly more effective to put down lots of sheets. then, once i have one layer, i jumped into my trunk (my weight is definitely going to press fm in deeper), the press and slash, roll and finger push that fm everywhere.  i could also sit in my trunk, turn every which way, press slash, etc.<br /><br />COVERAGE: so, 25sq feet is enough to put almost 3 layers into the trunk of a midsized sedan (2012 mazda 6).<br /><br />REGRET: i regret i didn't use a heat gun.... (now how many of us have heat guns???).  i should have just used a blow dryer on max heat.  it would have molded this stuff in better.  but again, i did it in the summer, left the fm out for a while...<br /><br />hoping the hot nyc sun will make my trunk so hot that eventually this stuff will meld and mold to achieve awesome adhesion.<br /><br />RESULTS: i tapped on the trunk when i was done.  definitely more &#34;solid&#34;.  like there is more metal there to block out some of the noise from the rear tires.<br /><br />SUMMARY: i'm glad i did it.  car is quieter, more comfortable to drive and sit in.  this stuff is cheap.  if an amateur like me can put it in, anyone can put it in.<br /><br />ADVICE (for trunk): just leave this stuff out in the sun for a little while... do it on a hot day (no joke), maybe buy a metal roller (not the plastic one included with this kit).  cut,put it on, do one layer first,  hair dryer (to make fm even more stretchable and more easily moldable.... then get in your trunk, sit on your rear end or balls of your sneakers, press/slash/stab/roll, turn on your feet while sitting inside... repeat repeat repeat.<br /><br />if you get air bubbles, slice it open with a knife, press in really really good.<br />if you have stuff left over... for goodness' sake, don't waste the stuff you paid for.  find someplace it will fit in and press it all in.  this stuff is only a few fingernails thick.  if you have some irregularities... like some pieces asymmetrically on top of each other.... who cares?<br /><br />just get as much fm into your car as u can.<br /><br />this stuff will do you no good if someone is in garbage.  make sure it all ends up in your car.  even under your spare tire if nowhere else.<br /><br />final words: ok, i know this review was long, maybe a little repetitive... maybe a little boring.... hopefully it helps one or two people out there.<br /><br />btw, if you really want  a quiet ride, go for pirelli cinturato p7 all season plus tires.  quietest tires man ever made.  most annoying noise from the car that you always hear is tire/road contact noise when car is in motion.  wind and engine noise can be mitigated just by slowing down or driving sanely..... but road noise will alway be with you even in local driving.<br /><br />if anyone has ? or feedback, please do reply.  i shall attempt to offer helpfulful advice.<br />thank you for reading
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Great product and fit like a glove!
B000EVYGZA|5|Does what it needs to do. My dad has a Fluke multi meter and I got tired of borrowing it from him, so I bought one for me. I wasn't going to spend big bucks on another Fluke. This one works just fine
B00926RY84|4|Perfect with our Santa Fe.
B004LQH6ME|5|great to have on the trail, if you ever damage a air line, this has everything needed for a quick fix!
B00C0XLNV0|5|Great quality.
B001B5DCO4|4|Grabs good. Nice smooth shift engagements. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the clutch pedal is a little softer than what I'm use to so its hard to get a good feel for it. Matched this with the Exedy racing flywheel  Update 9/20/15: put about 1,500 miles on the clutch and it still feels like when I put it in. Broke it in after 500 miles and it grabs hard for an oem clutch.
B0094MLSHE|4|Positive side: beautiful style, look like they're from a farari,<br />Negative side: mirror's shake too much for passing on highway, sometimes the mirror is too small to see out of, highly recommend blind spot mirrors 2&#34; round.<br />Overall I give these mirrors a 4 star.<br />The seller gets 5 stars for having them so inexpensively, Bob N.<br />1999 Ford mustang V6
B00NR6TPMS|5|Larger than expected but hold great found a great use for them. I was going to put them on my bike but they are too big. However they are perfect for my truck.
B000C7ZZG0|5|Instillation was a snap
B00E3VVLE6|4|Super easy to install.  Works as it should.  Inlet and fuel line size should be larger for better flow rates.  Also, a better check valve should be used so that it can shut off fuel in a pressurized system.  I have a small, 1 gallon/minute pump to transfer fuel from my slip tank to truck and the minimal pressure that the pump does build is enough to keep the check valve open causing fuel to poor out of gas cap.<br /><br />Still, it's a good product for the money and I'm not sure anyone makes a product with a better check valve or electronic pressure switch.  I would recommend  this product.
B000P19Z5K|5|EXCELLENT!  Enhances the look if my bike. GREAT PRICE! Perfect fit!
B00WTIKU9W|5|Perfect!
B000EVU8JS|5|Pretty good quality, works well.

B008Y7LM6M|5|Was everything it is supposed to be
B00M0ASZRI|5|great item thank we are very happy
B000EQ1INI|1|Purchased this a year ago it should have lasted longer than it did not sure why its broke again but it should not have gone bad!
B00MST2DE2|5|great item thank u we are very happy
B004GW3OO2|5|As advertised
B003Y82E5E|5|great item thank u we are very happy
B001GF7MVS|4|works perfectly and fit on my range rover sport
B009B4CJJQ|4|So far so good product was exactly as described no problems yet
B00RU9KC4S|5|Decent set of mats for the price.
B00LC8AV80|3|worked after modifying the battery holder by trimming plastic & using the metal holder from the original fob otherwise it wouldn't make electrical contact w/original electronics from old fob
B002EBWTA2|5|Highly rated oil filter
B002R61XBK|5|Excellent product!
B0068ERBTK|5|This one did the trick.  Cools my built 350 5.7 in a 48 Willys jeep. Have had 2 of these Griffin rad this one and the 22x19 with 1&#34; tubes. Both have taken a beating in the rocks and doing great.  Thanks
B00371VLAC|5|Stealthy product. Works great.
B00B1V9OUE|2|Very disappointing, the top of the helmet was uncomfortable, the face piece kept coming loose and falling off. The only thing it had going for it was the Face piece took away from the bobble head effect making it look more reasonable....when it stayed on. Also it really restricts what type of glasses/goggles that you can wear. Had to return. First item ever returned to amazon in my many years of using it.
B000EQU1DQ|4|just as described
B002R0L4QK|5|Fits perfect. Took all of 10min to install
B0043E9JEW|5|Good product
B0002KKIV4|5|Great product - cleans as promised !!!
B001L7S7PG|5|Top of the line, no complaints at all. Easy to install and looks great on my Passat.
B000EQ8V9W|5|These new shocks stiffened and smoothed out the ride of my truck a lot after replacing the stock units which had 160,000 miles on them. Only time will tell how durable these ones are.
B00DUFC8MU|5|Excellent
B001BAWBAU|5|works great!
B000CKJJNW|5|ok
B00CJHCXD4|5|I bought these to replace my oem engine mounts on my stock 2000 honda civic ex and they feel so much better everytime u down shift u dnt feel like your shifter is just gonna shift for u since it moves so much u definately will not feel the engine move allot IF u have a stick shift car, NOW user be warned if u want to drive a honda like a cadillac these are not for u these engine mounts will make ur car vibrate a little more than regular and it will make your car louder but besides that i love them
B000C9H6C4|2|As AC Delco states &#34;Note: ACDelco partners with other manufacturers to supply the parts your car was originally built with. This product is in an ACDelco package, however the part may have been manufactured by an independent ACDelco supplier and could have a different color or shape than the product image above.&#34;<br />This crap made in CHINA! If AC DELCO had mentioned this in the description then I would not have bought them or the other brake parts, hubs and springs, from them !! I wont again.<br />Why in hell does AC Delco give the CHINESE our jobs is beyond me!! The Chinese use sub par crap to build these parts and I don't like it!<br />AC DELCO - SHAME SHAME SHAME on you!!! I am through with your crap!
B00JR5EJO2|5|These are so cute in my daughters' car! The only thing I would say is that the brake wrap is a little too small for her break handle...but hey, it fits perfectly on her blinker! So yeh, she's styling!
B00Q0TIGSS|5|Very pleased, I don't know if they're as good as the Harley lights but at half the price I'm very thrilled. The white color and far reaching beam make the night ride far less treacherous. I've already recommended them to others. You might want to add a frenched trim ring to cover the headlight as it sticks out beyond the stock trim ring.  This is my first review ever...I like them so much I wanted others to know.
B005AUONAS|5|Great antenna !!!
B00WFHWOPK|4|I wish I could rate it higher, but the performance depends too much on how you drive.<br />Installation was very easy. I could tell it was &#34;thinking&#34; for a few days while adjusting to my driving style. Now the bottom line is I drive 500 miles a week on cruise control, highway mileage. For me this is great as I picked up 2 -3 mpg.<br />When in town, highway stop & go, or similar conditions, you have to watch your foot peddle.There does seem to be more performance which uses more gas.<br />So that's it. For me on the highway it definitely has paid off. If you want performance it will give a little more. If you use it and just drive around town or stop & go traffic to work every day, I don't believe this would be an advantage to have.
B008XO9ATC|5|Solid springs and hardware. Directions could be more clear.
B00N396W6Q|5|It was great & it fit like glove...thanks....
B000EVU8MK|4|Great device for remote operation of starter when doing tasks under hood... checking compression, electrical testing of sensors... well built for price.
B000E28ELG|4|The packaging can be better, not sure how.  This is an hefty hitch with rating greater than the 97 Ford Explorer I was mounting on. There were layers of bubble wrap and plastic over the painted hitch with a smallish piece of cardboard covering a fraction of the tube, but clearly there were various nicks and hard scrapes on the paint.  The stickers were pushes so hard two of them were torn and moved.<br />Mounted on 97 Ford Explorer without drilling.  I was pleased that the holes lined up perfectly. For a one-man operation, I used a floor jack under some scrape wood board to help lift the weighty hitch. It took a bit of back and forth to line up and got it through the gap behind the bumper bracket but it went through. Got the holes closed, using a screw driver to temporarily locate the position did not work as well as just putting a bolt through. The manual listed 3/4&#34;, 15/16&#34;, 15mm, 18mm & 21mm wrench needed.  Two sizes are actually needed, 3/4&#34; and 15/16&#34; or 19mm and 24mm. The bolts are kind of long which help initially but made using the short socket impossible to grip the nut once tightened.  I tried long 3/4&#34; socket but was not able to get the wrench in through the gap under the bumper.  I used two sockets, one must be long or with extension to tighten the horizontal mounted nuts, 15/16&#34;. At the end, though I have a torque wrench and 15/16&#34; sockets, I did not have enough strength to tighten them to 100 ft-lb specified. (4 bolts/nuts were tightened as much as I could but not to specified 75 and 100 ft-lb.)<br />The hitch looked to be pointing down slightly.  I had not put it to work yet.  Will try to update the review after I used it.
B008G3KG70|5|Great bright lights
B00TJAHZSW|5|A great cleaner
B00LB61TCK|5|Excellent product,decent price. We now have 5 of these in my shop. The oldest is still working after 20 years.
B00B2ASZ18|1|Bough this for a 2008 jayco emergency exit window, looked about right. Screwed it in broke first time. Factory was poor quality, this one worse! I retrofitted with some metal I had in my shop. Don't be like me, believe the poor reviews... Save your money,
B0023VKXAG|1|Condensation started building up inside the light almost immediately - this is the second fog light I've ordered from Amazon that leaks, both from different manufacturers.  I may try to seal it with silicone caulk, since it takes a contortionist to remove & install.
B007TXXGIO|5|Nice product great price
B000AS3D3S|5|Works great as a filter and retains back flow oil when engine is turned off thus assisting with oil delivery when engine is started.  Starvation during engine start is contributed to as much as 15% of engine life wear.
B0024ECJSQ|5|It's a battery box...  Love it is relative.  However, it works perfectly for the purpose.
B00IW0CWUQ|5|Love it !!!!
B00RY4NQJM|1|Bad quality decal
B00PQWN5DQ|5|This is a handy little tool. Will get one for each car when they go on sale
B00BUS3AKS|5|perfect fit for our 2015 forester.
B000FPY15K|4|works well
B00GSRXLE6|5|Great quality, easy to clean. The lining holds even liquids!
B004TC6USQ|5|Easy to install and works great
B00HPTL0R6|5|On time, no extra taxes! Just perfect and simple.
B0066SZ6H2|1|Not good at all
B00452EO7Y|4|Very Good Product
B0049DUJ4G|5|Fits my ford escape 2.3L 2008<br />so far so good
B00MH4663C|5|Great product. Buy it, you will be happy you did one day.
B002K3UPAU|4|Very good value and works good.
B001TJWO4Q|3|Not sure if this works that well or not.  Tried it in the wheel wells of my Jeep and it made them look better but I'll need to use it a few more times to see how long it lasts.
B007EHOWNI|3|Its ok.
B001HQEC2S|1|did not work at all for me, destroyed my brand new plug wires, and wasted most of my day off,just bought a new set of plug wires and will try again with a different tool,
B00RW7WXDQ|5|Works good
B0016LG0CY|4|Worked just as planned. I had just purchased a new 2015 Scion TC, and I wanted to get some bright LED's setup under the driver and passenger seats. The installation was quite easy, and because my LED's were already wired for Sound Activation...Turned on the JAMS and I was ready to go!<br /><br />Update 09/26/2016.<br /><br />The device died within two weeks. Tossed it for what it was worth. The fuse would have cost more to replace then the unit.
B00GOW6V5Q|5|getting one of these changes the look of the trailer immediately. no more exposed propane tanks! considering the ease of assembly i don't understand why i see so many trailers without them
B003D1N5KU|5|Great thanks
B00UN56QXW|5|Great product great price!
B00M9DCMNE|2|I bought these lights to use as a puddle lamp on my wifes truck to illuminate the ground beneath the steps, they are probably best suited for licence light an not for anthing else.
B00PWXDWFK|5|We put it in our 1994 Jeep Wrangler to replace the broken center console. Its sleek and very functional. I can take the top off the jeep and not worry about important documents being stolen.
B00SG2ANPG|4|Does the job nicely, but... Changing the electrical socket takes a bit of &#34;McGivering&#34; without the GM special tool and the ashtray does not fit snugly in the cup holder. Once done, however, and a can cozy around the base of the ashtray, it perfect! It would be nice if the kit included the special tool.
B00FC22PVS|3|This kit replace my last 35w kit due to flickering issues and not enough brightness. 55w Hid kit is worth it. I notice the brightness on these bulbs and it is what i an looking for. No more flickering.  Installed with a replay harness ( definitely recommended to use with any HID kit). I will buy more to install in my family cars. Thanks Innovited!!.<br /><br />Update Feb-2017. Just after one year and a half years of use. The driver side ballast is busted. Warranty expired so I won't get a replacement. Bummer. I thought these ballast would last longer. I may have to try another brand.
B00B1TNQCS|5|Fits like it came from the factory. Highly recommend this item.
B00JCE141Y|5|Got these for my 2012 Ducati Diavel. Lovely chain. Black with a tinge of rose gold. Diavel stock chain is 525.  These are 530 so it must be stronger.
B00JKSSXFM|4|The ones from JDM World are authentic. Front and steering wheel emblems size is just perfect, the back is indeed a bit smaller.
B00K1NS0PS|5|Works great, does what it needs to do!
B007OW656A|4|Not the same size as the original rear wiper on my Prius.
B00ELHNQBI|5|great price for a American icon
B000CIXO3U|4|It works fine. Easy To install. Getting the old one out was difficult. I think it hurt my mpg though.
B002LGPDKS|5|Got these bad boys a week early! They look great and they just match the rest of my ride. I ride a 2913 ZX6R!
B00DSD4LYC|5|Its a Guns n Roses sticker.
B00X65LH9O|5|It seems to be good quality.  Not to much mushroom head. And shipped it over night for no extra charge. Awesome
B004ZF39T0|5|Great lights for the price
B007OTGZOK|4|Fit my 12K winch. These things will fade in the sun and only last a couple of years.
B000C1K09I|5|well fited
B00BITKD2W|5|Easy to install, quick shipping!
B00HZ7C85Q|3|Missing holes needed, had to make them myself
B00H7LPKKU|5|Awesome
B0041TOWBY|1|This item only worked 6 months around 3000 miles.
B004EYGWWS|4|Very good for non automotive uses. Ok for automotive uses. But for heavy stuff dealing with sharp edges they will tear. Still 10x better than most gloves like harbor freight whatnot. They do not tear easily and are very comfortable and thin. Easy to take off and on also.<br />For the money they are great.
B00YDDT9IO|4|I liked it but it not wide enough
B001NYFOK8|5|Great product. Fast shipping.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great product!
B00WT5HW0U|5|On time, as advertised.
B00LOX1A06|5|Cute and went on with no problem. Follow the directions and you won't have any problems.
B00BOFFE2E|5|I cross referenced Ford OEM Foglight Part# (4F9Z-15200-AA) for my 2013 Ford Focus ST and came across these oem alternatives. Fast shipping from seller, Glass Lenses, Strong build quality and a Night and Day difference compared to my stock scratced/etched pair. Install was a breeze and the longest part of the entire job was just having to adjust the beams to the proper height. A++ on quality and fit and finish.
B00DZL2B9O|1|Pros:<br />- Black colour looks nice on my visors<br />- Holds more CDs than most other visor CD cases<br />- Not stupidly thick<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't actually hold your CDs in place; they go flying when you take turns at anything other than a snail's pace
B006TWUD7S|5|These grips are great. Easy to install, look and feel great.
B002FDGTD2|5|I love this thing . sounds amazing!! Loud !! Bought this for my 14 Yamaha fz6r but had to do some modifications. Would definitely buy again.
B0002UEN1A|5|I used this stuff befor on my gas furnace high temp. exhaust line and it works great for sealing the joints in line. Holds up well and met my expectations.
B000CB94PY|5|Arrived as promised.
B000IG5PU6|1|Terrible quality. My 12V car accessories that should plug into the adapter plug in and then pop out, resulting in an unreliable connection and endless frustration. Save your money.
B00BTLEHSK|1|Purchased not happy with them they say they are washable well I washed and the Velcro stuck to the cheap nylon on the back and it snagged and ran like a pair of nylons and I see no return on damaged product
B00S1NT2SE|5|Husband's...he's bought this before
B00NSS35I0|5|Put these in my fog lights on my 2005 Nissan frontier i bought the h11 80w and my god these things are bright and look great to and better yet they also come with a 2 year warranty keep up the good work boltlink you have a great product!
B0017OANWI|3|If you have a 2014 Honda Civic, don't buy these. They don't fit even though the page tells you it fits the car. I got stuck paying almost $7 to ship it back, such a waste of money...
B000630B5K|5|great.
B00DUFC8MU|5|Fit just as described, I'm a happy camper
B009EVOKBQ|2|-eh, nothing too special. Not a great fit, okay install, directions not the best. Returned because it wasn't what I was looking for.
B0002JMFKM|5|Great product for finding leaks. Price resonably
B00553KYTE|5|worked great, runs smoother.
B0091MISA2|4|Very cute picture and recommend it.
B007ZCQD9S|4|Takes a while to install, but it definitely works and works well.
B0021I6J4K|5|they fit on my motorcycle just fine!
B00F4MQJ5O|5|It's awesome
B0082GL0MQ|5|Perfect fit for my car.
B00069QLVC|5|Installed in engine compartment of RV. Ford V10. Sound and heat diminished immediately. Drove over 1000 miles and barely heard engine at cruising speed. Felt no heat on compartment either. Buying this product again to put around Onan 5500 generator! Worth the money!
B0002LBGX2|5|excellent product
B00B4WV06Q|5|Fit like a glove for my 09' Tahoe..
B00429NKWK|5|Don't believe the instructions which say you can do this in 30 minutes... I did mine over the course of 2 days. The results you get will depend upon the amount of work you put in, and how much of a perfectionist you are!<br />Fortunately, I had many hours of experience with sanding from working with my Dad as a kid: you do three rounds of it with course, medium, and fine grits, then put in some more elbow grease with a buffing (clarifying compound), and lastly apply a clearcoat/UV protectant - this last step is a one-time shot - no Mulligans!<br />Take your time, sand evenly and repeatedly, and mentally rehearse the clearcoat application, and you'll get great results! My 2003 Saturn has 160,000 miles on it and my headlight lenses were almost amber yellow, opaque/totally foggy - and now they look like new!! (replacements would have been $250 to $300 EACH!!)
B0073MF84Q|5|Fast shipping easy to install great price Thanks
B00YCWYZIU|4|Can only give 4 of 5 because there is no place to mount the air bag sensor...I had to zip tie it, it's missing the factory mount points the stock grill has....other than that, perfect!
B000J1Y33A|4|One view of the tool shows one end to be almost a 90 degree bend...that's not true.  The other photo is accurate.  I received a pair of these 30 min. ago (8am) for our first Sunday Prime 2-day delivery...as advertised!!!  Not packed well but they are 'iron.'  I haven't had a chance to use them to change tires & tubes for my Model T yet.
B00CFM9QLA|3|Definitely thought it would be more durable. It's pretty flimsy but it will hold stuff well if it is packed full. All in all, it keeps stuff from being able to freely move around in the trunk space of my SUV and keeps it more organized.
B000FQ0BTY|3|This was hard to insert also but did get it to work.
B001FMPCZA|3|not bad
B000C9GLEI|5|Got rid of my check iengine light on my 1995 Chevy Silverado
B000C9G3GO|2|MADE IN CHINA !
B00AI2W5MQ|5|excelente
B00063Y1F6|5|Great product, professional grade and easy to grip and use.  I asked my mechanic what he used and he pulled out the Marson 39000 HP-2.  He has had his for a long time and has worked flawlessly.  You can feel the &#34;heft&#34; and comfort right away.  Comes with a little wrench to secure the various rivet sizes.  Recommend!
B000NWJJLG|5|Rain X 2-1 Glass Cleaner and rain repellant  I used today  can't wait for rain to see the results
B00GSAUHB8|5|I live in the California desert, and this is a mudt have. This item is a replacement for one I had for years, but was too large for my new car. It is perfect!
B005LXTOHQ|5|Perfect fit and zero problems with installation on my 2005 Pilot.  50 bucks on Prime - would have cost $250 for dealer installation I would guess.  Very easy to install, especially after watching a YouTube video on how to do it.  Worked perfectly out of the box.
B000GU7RAU|5|Cheap replacement for ugly factory Hayabusa mirrors. I know for gsxr but they fit Gen 1 busa perfect. And look soooooo much better. I used 1 1/2&#34; extenders to get past. Elbows (factory were even shorter) and they are Just awesome. Match instrument panel faux carbon perfectly..
B00BUSIKQ2|5|Fits 2015 Jeep Cherokee like a glove
B00TH1VU7K|1|Not what they claim to be... the fabric doesn't expand at all and the balaclavas are child size
B0075K74ES|5|easy to put on
B009PBUOA6|5|Perfect factory style glass.
B004PL4920|4|These are really nice compact mirrors. As the measurements show these are quite small but I haven't had trouble seeing in them. The chrome coating looks nice but the edges of the recess in which the mirrors sit are kind of sharp and a little rough. I also had trouble getting these adjusted and then tightened sufficiently to stay the way I liked them but eventually I figured it out and they've stayed put for a few hundred miles now. Overall I would say that these are solid and really nice for the price.
B00BBMDAL2|5|Very convenient
B0002UEN1A|5|I love this item, you never. Are going to need gaskets
B00S8KQCYW|5|I loved these made the car look pretty neat! The front fit snug not sure about the back yet. Overall great buy.
B00GSAUHB8|1|Flimsy and cheap.  No support at all.  I have the same BMW X5 they used for the main product picture. ....the only way they have it sitting in the window that perfectly w/out falling down is because they had to have pined all the corners...even pulling down the visor hardly helps it stay in the window.
B000CB1VP0|5|Thanks
B00ST2AHE0|5|O K
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Excellent light for boat
B002CFQNM0|4|great product and an a+ company!
B00KH75EES|3|Not as bright as expected, only bright at night
B0085IJG0O|5|This works great with my Jayco Whitehawk Travel Trailer. I just hope it is enough to prevent someone from stealing it.
B003G0U3BM|5|good fit and easy to take out to shake it off. just a little expensive for a piece of rubber.
B002WQT3TE|5|Was great experience.  Exactly what I ordered.  Thank you!
B00BJCN5XW|5|Ordered these a while ago and just recently got around to using them. Used in one of the steps to resurface the plastic headlight housing on a vehicle  and worked great.
B00MMQ85Y8|3|The spring compressor is of good quailty but won't compress my valve springs enough to in stall the new hi performance springs.
B00TEA5PZC|5|Very nice frame.  Nicely polished.  It came with stainless screws and screw caps.  Not the cheap plastic caps that most frames come with.  The screw caps fit very tight, so I would say there is little if any chance of the caps falling off.  Good value for the money.
B0007RDVGQ|2|I thought this would clean the leather in my car better than it actually does. Pretty disappointed!
B000CAYT78|5|I'm glad it's USA made. Bought it to replace my old cracked serpentine belt on my 2008 Corolla. Direct figment and feels real sturdy.
B004E4ESJ2|5|Very high quality materials and assembly.  Looks great as well.
B00PC5GKWU|5|A bit challenging to install but its on and has already paid for itself.
B000CD8IEK|3|Works great! Lasted a year and counting.
B001C9JAKY|5|This worked great  in my truck.
B00WYBYL5S|5|Perfect! Fast delivery!
B00KCAX4VU|5|Almost as easy as buying a truck with one already installed. The whole process only took about a half an hour and that was mostly unscrewing and rescrewing all the screws on the tailgate.  When completed this looks like a OEM installation and is super easy to use. Has a clear and sharp viewing area. I gave this 5 stars because the final results looks like it came from the factory.<br />.
B000E4JLM0|5|worked great
B005JJ8TYQ|5|Better than the other ceeeeper brand that I took off with a hammer and screwdriver in one minute...<br />Looks like a well built lock..
B00WMKRE9Q|5|Works as it should.
B0070Y36N2|5|Fits great looks great I will be buying two more soon the workmen ship is great very clean
B004ZF4F2U|5|Fast shipping, great product, and quick install if you know what you are doing, The lights are so bright that i light up road signs from blocks away and i blind everyone in my 4×4 and thats when they flick me the bird lol. All in all this is worth your hard earned money. Even if it may be made in china, but im not to sure, still...that dont mean $#!+ because in my personal opinion, this kit is awesome 100%. I recommend others who may be hesitant on buying this due to where its made and/or not knowing how to properly install this, its only easy to do, you just need a brain to read instructions and you go from there... tada...
B000CPI5ZK|4|put it in the car and works fine....difficult to tell if it is good or not
B000F5ECYA|5|Works very well for every car I've used it on. The different fittings and bars can reach more places than I can.<br />Highly recommend...
B004QHEDW4|1|Never worked
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works fine
B00KTHZ2EI|5|Highly recommend quality remote Paired to my car with no problems. THANKS!!!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Extraordinary value; fitted to my 2010 Buell Ulysses XB12X using custom bracket. Quality hardware as well, although I replaced the mounting bolt/nut with a stainless locknut arrangement. Surprisingly heavy; take this into account when mounting.
B0044A5UPW|5|THIS PART IS FANTASTIC AND THE SERVICE LESS THAN 24 HRS!
B0039YWT62|5|Makes a big difference in sound. I highly recommend using these
B00V1OIOXY|5|Love it and it's illumination.
B007IDI3E2|1|Extremely cheesy! Thought this would mount to anchor points on top of truck bed sides! No ! It just screws down to wherever. Cheap stuff
B00FZN9IMS|4|This product appeared to work properly and eliminate a Check Engine warning on my 2013 Dodge Challenger
B000COP6QC|5|Very nice low deep tone. It is quieter than we expected, but still works great.
B0024E6W02|1|This hose kit states that it is 20' or 10'...<br />WRONG....<br />Each hose is 9' long i streached it untill it started to crack snap pop.<br /> I just want to know whete my other 2' are?
B00LBA6K5W|4|They fit and work like original
B000OUZYAW|5|Very sturdy and comfortable.  Great price
B0050VF9RS|5|No issues
B00C8RY97S|1|I Have Contacted the sellers they do Not fit MY A4 Quatro 1999 as stated Never heard back from the vender
B000GRXT50|5|no more slip Barnett rocks!
B002N5W8Q4|1|Stopped working after a couple of months. Do not buy.
B00H4JK8MK|1|Does NOT fit 2001 Honda Shadow!  Even the dealer couldn't put it on!  I'd have to pull apart and reupholster the passenger seat. Plus I had to pay for return shipping. Do not buy.
B002TS2ZSG|5|Thank you!
B000O060QO|5|Oem seal cheaper than ford worked great
B000M61JFC|5|Was exactly what i expected fast shipping also
B000C21I7K|3|When you need a tune up, this fits the bill.  My Geo Metro runs great with these plug wires.  I did have one problem after installing the plug wires, the car ran really rough.  I had a friend check my work and he found that I didn't make full contact with the plug.  I found them a little difficult to push them onto the plug, not sure why or if this is the way it is supposed to be.  It was made of good quality and am pleased with the wires.
B001O0CCLA|5|fit good
B0007ZL174|4|It got lost on first try.
B00AOA9I54|5|These liners fit the contours like a glove and it's so much easier to clean by just vacuuming!
B009X23B2U|5|A++++
B00GYQ8G50|4|Nice
B00KTIF652|1|Didn't work
B00I14W7YY|5|For sure,the best there is!
B000L7QZ0Q|5|Worked great. First time making a double flare & did it on the first try.
B00RV83UUG|5|This light is super bright and really helps when going off-road or needing to light up a work site.
B00UA80NOU|5|Very Nice
B010MHV00O|5|Perfect
B0038385H6|5|Hope to order more of these products for our motorcycle
B00TXR888M|4|Very good. Does the job
B005PCCZLA|5|Good
B0002HRBSU|4|Good product
B00DP5D51I|5|Everything that I needed. Good quality material. All I ask for is a bigger shipping box. Just a personal request though.
B000MD4YKM|5|Great light and easy to grip grease gun.
B00HS1HOFI|5|Great and fast service!
B000C6IXKG|5|Finally, a well made product of the USA for my wife's 1985 Kubota L-185.  I was using a WIX filter, but they've started getting quite expensive around here.
B004H78NQ0|1|Chinese crap don't buy
B008G38X2K|5|Perfect fit
B00BLV5D86|3|The gasket was not the same as the factory gasket and it leaked and I had to get a factory gasket and it fixed the leak. Otherwise it was fine, bolted right on. Buy one without the gasket and then get the factory gasket from the dealer.
B008O17D48|5|Very very good for alerting others to young driver. I know people were a lot more cautious compared to when we didn't have one on.. LOVE IT
B00BM7G2HK|1|worked as it should  happy
B0080PADJK|5|Thanks You!!!
B0009VA80C|5|Good fit
B00ED5EIIS|3|It was easy to install and the instructions were wrong
B0007QGT34|5|It's gear oil, worked well... seems a bit higher quality than the old stuff I pulled out of the transmission... would recommend getting a pump with a longer down tube, these bottles are not your standard quart bottle.
B00692RUBA|5|Advance Auto wanted 35.00 dollars for the same filter. I did entire oil change for less.
B002G47GE6|5|as promised on time correct product
B004GDTZFS|5|great
B006WFJETA|5|Nice long wire and good reception
B00HEBPNDM|5|Fit perfectly on our 2005 Grand Cherokee
B00K09XTNQ|4|Very Good. 3m tape needs to be a little better.
B00M9LUTGI|5|Got this for my 2014 RZR 1000. Fits great and excellent quality.
B00KTHWNL8|5|Best way to save 500 bucks. Don't go to the dealer and get ripped off. Just bring these keys to a locksmith and program yourself.
B000KKCW10|5|Great for the price
B00B4KTH90|4|Just what was needed!
B00JA9WG9U|2|Requires long valve stems ( otherwise works fine )
B00DNITEW6|4|So cute.  Jazzes up my boring minivan no end.
B0007M8ZWG|5|It's my 2015 Dodge Ram 3500 perfectly. Very happy with the product and the operation
B00AYIY9DM|5|Once you learn how to put the window in correctly.......these work great.  If you don't, though......the force will break them.  I finally got the window to slide properly by getting the alignment right.....and voila'.....A-OK now!
B000WJDU88|1|Item received was the little black relay in the picture.  Before you purchase, make sure you read about what you are getting.  The picture is not what you get.
B000TYVKYM|5|easy to install, and its been in my Frontier for several years
B002UJVNFA|4|Fast shipping.  Nice glasses.
B000S2SHZK|3|Didn't work out for problem.
B001PYQZ7C|4|Fit well perfect fit on my 1998 Mustang gt Just wish they would have dropped the TORX design
B00192KY04|5|Does a great job keeping out bees.
B000P76ETY|5|Perfect size to wrap an OEM cast iron exhaust manifold. It really lowered my underhood temperature an stopped my oil pressure sending unit wiring from being damaged by the exhaust heat.
B003FBV8ZW|4|Got these last year. One came broken but overall good up to 65mph
B002R0R3PG|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 New Beetle 1.9 diesel
B003FPF22I|5|Just as promised. Installation took 15mins. Ez install for both sides and both hi and low beams
B000EPMQR6|5|I am verry happy with the way it looks. It was super easy to install. Much better than the 1st brand fuel door I purchased and I had to send back because it wouldn't fit. Spend a little extra mony an buy this one. Don't waste your time with that cheaper one.
B000CQBMGS|5|just what i needed the switch worked just fine glad you had it in stock
B00032KC3K|5|No problems
B000RFOOO6|5|These are the best quality thread repair kits.
B003C1M3NG|5|Saved my boots, exact replacement ---even better than the originals
B000EQUVWW|5|Great quality. Looks great on my 750Li.
B0096DW4C4|4|No real problems at all... Good value for support. ...
B008Y2RZ7W|4|Descent product.
B00B1O1I3W|5|Great product same as the picture
B00029WQTW|5|Very good unit. The only problem I have had is I cannot get the unit to hold the speed above 69MPH. I believe it is the TV cable going to the tranny  has too much tension.
B00IGZQT38|5|I love these car matts. They're not a hard plastic, more rubbery. They fit my 2010 Subaru perfectly.
B00BJJZIYY|5|Perfect match to the original.
B001GX9U3S|5|Just as described, just watch when spraying on edges as it likes to build up.
B00FYX2E66|5|Awesome seat covers. They install quickly and easily. They avtually stay in place!
B00M0TLQ66|5|Wish this stuff had existed 20x years ago. No damage whatsoever, parts come out as-new. Will also take bluing off firearms.
B00DM02P2Q|5|I bought my 2000 honda civic ex without this item on my battery so tue battery just bounced around once i installed i was relived cuz i knew it will hold on to my battery, this will not come with mounting bolts or anything else but the bracket that sits on top off battery
B003SS62PS|5|I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product- a lot of people said it was noisy but I have found that with the engine running and A/C blowing, I don't even notice the &#34;hum&#34; of the fan. I followed the advice of another reviewer and just clipped it to the garmet hook and it has a strong enough grip that it hasn't moved since I put it there. This product helps my poor kids in the very back of our minivan where they get no air flow and keeps them from getting/staying uncomfortably hot. This is a great product for the price!!
B00G9DLFHY|5|Im wearing this every day for 1 year in a caribbean weather with more than 95°F an fits perfect, protects very well, very confortables and I bought again
B002FP6M8W|5|Used on my golf cart for local radio stations and it works great. Very easy to install.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|Nice Detailing towels. As Advertised.
B00LIDY5HW|5|Received an Amazon prime shipping just as I expected to write to my car as soon as I got it looks so cute love it
B005GBJZVI|5|Worked perfectly
B00J42PK6O|5|One word perfect
B000GAP428|5|Great value great delivery
B0007RVLT0|5|Just used this product on my 2005 Nissan Titan's trim. Have used products from Chemical Guys and Mother's for the faded trim on my Titan with mixed results. While the paint still looks factory fresh thanks to Chemical Guys products, the trim has taken a beating over time despite everything I have tried. This product is easy to use and works into the trim for a very deep black look and shine. After over two weeks in July/early August heat and a couple of rain storms, the trim is still nice and black. So far would highly recommend.
B0031CMD5O|5|Quick fast service exactly what I wanted an order
B000CN6TPU|5|We have been using these coolers with our race cars for years. Some other go and buy the $900 set ups for their cars. We keep using these for oil, trans and diff coolers. They work perfect! The only thing we dont like is the fact that it comes with reducer hardware. We don't use the hardware that comes with it. We use the same size as the port in the cooler itself. The hardware that comes with it reduces the flow to 50%
