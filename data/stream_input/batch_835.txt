B001M5UDGS|3.0|I'm not quite sure if I can bring myself to purchase this on DVD. I jumped at it when I saw it on iTunes and was left feeling rather flat by the change in tone over the course of the three acts.    I don't want to spoil this for others that may not have seen it but I went from laughing to feeling very flat over the running time of the show.    While I appreciate what tremendous effort was put in by cast and crew on what appears to be a shoestring budget, I just like being left on a brighter note than this finishes on.     Kudos Joss and company, but maybe the ending could be revisited...
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Enya still has it after two decades in the music industry. For a new age audience, she still captures my heart after listening to her sing in her unique celtic style. This winter Christmas seasonal album would make a perfect holiday present for the Enya fan of any religious background or none. It can be perfect for the Winter Solstice too.
B00139XZF4|1.0|Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.    The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you've never heard of Tool, this is the album to listen to first. Tool is one of the best progressive metal bands of all time, my personal favorite on top of that. They're music is very well...mind-bending, whether that's bad, good, or just crazy, it's all what the listener decides. Not just the music, but the interesting tracks, like Ions, where all you hear is electrons charging.    My personal favorite songs are Stinkfist, Eulogy, H, Jimmy, and 46 & 2. The rest of the album is still great. This album just has a tendency to keep you listening to it over and over again, and is just a great record to add to your music collection if you haven't already.

158542627X|4.0|I'm not a fan of the \\"Law of Attraction\\" in general, but I think this book has merit. It's got some explanations and exercises for getting one's mind in the right frame for cooperating with the forces that be, in any case.   The only trouble is that it's very badly written. It was originally meant to be a weekly mail-order course, and maybe it worked better in that context. Each chapter begins with a brief argument, then several paragraphs of short statements to reflect on, then usually a weekly exercise, and finally a Q and A that's really a summary of all the paragraphs that made up the bulk of the actual chapter. There are several chapters where the weekly excercise is the only information of real value it provides -- perhaps an abridged version of the book should be released.

B0007D0AZU|5.0|Drop everything and get into Betty Davis. This really is it! This is raw uncut funk like no other.    What amazes is why no one has made a big deal about her in all these years.  This is right up there with James Brown, Sly and P-Funk.     Hopefully new generations will discover this killer talent, who was sadly overlooked by her own generation.

0316018953|4.0|Wow!  If nothing else, The Overlook by Michael Connely is an education in radiation detection, dirty bombs, and high-tech anti-terrorism.  Our old friend Harry (Hieronymus) Bosch has been called to a late-night crime scene. Physicist Stanley Kent has been executed at an overlook on Mulholland Drive and missing from the scene is a container that is presumed to contain stolen radioactive material from one of the many hospitals where he has privileges.<br /><br />Enter Rachel Walling, tough FBI agent and Bosch's former lover, from whom he parted badly in the last book (Echo Park). He has to fight with everything he's got to keep the case once the Feds arrive and he uses some artful tricks that give him short-term results but might entirely derail his resurrected career in the long run.<br /><br />Something's rotten with the whole thing and unlikely people end up as the target of the FBI's anti-terror squads. Is this the plot of a group of people who have escaped the federal radar or are the Feds wildly off-mark?  Bosch thinks that things aren't what they seem but how to solve this case, keep his job, and maybe thaw the ice at least a little with Rachel.  It's a big order and this book is up to the job. Nice read.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I am way too old to be liking music found on \\"One Of The Boys\\", but try as I might, I could not tear myself away from \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" and it's catchy melody, nor could I do the same with \\"Hot N Cold\\". The two songs refuse to go away and be ignored. They are two pieces of pure pop platinum!<br /><br />Listening to the rest of the album was almost as much of a pleasure. The title track, \\"Waking Up In Vegas\\", \\"Mannequin\\", \\"If You Can Afford Me\\", \\"Lost\\"--all of them have infectious melodies and choruses with pure pop energy not unlike Kelly Clarkson, P!nk, All American Rejects, etc.<br /><br />The lyrics are wry, the attitude is spot on. This reminds me of how Madonna started not with her debut, but with \\"Like A Virgin\\". In fact, Madonna has endorsed Katy Perry, particularly the non-pc \\"Ur So Gay\\".<br /><br />Overall, this is a strong debut, and secretly I await to see what she does next. Is this a one album wonder, or will she continue to offer more great songs. Time will tell, but in the meantime, \\"One Of The Boys\\" will do.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I had watched this movie in the cinemas.  But, i'm afraid i prefer the previous bat man movies!    Christopher Nolan has the habit of hiding action choreography with dark scenes, and quick micro view of fighting sequences which makes me wonder what when by.  Honestly, I cannot savour the action scenes half the time, 'cos they are either hidden by the dark lighting or a partial micro view of the action!    Sorry such direction may fool the rather imaginative audience who rely totally on their subconcious imagination for action, but not me.  I am not convinced of the shortchanging action sequence. My ultimate hero movie is still the Spiderman trilogy, where you can savour clearly the action sequence that is really a mastery of action hero movies at its finest.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|\\"Our Bright Future\\" marks 20 years of Tracy Chapman, and from the first time I saw the video for \\"Fast Car\\" in 1988 I was sold. I went out and immediately bought her self titled debut at age 15. I appreciated Chapman's stark approach compared to what I was listening to at the time. She stood out. Of course now, years later, I understand Joan Armatrading, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and a host of others paved the way for Tracy, but I have continued to buy everything from her during her 20 year tenure.<br /><br />\\"Our Bright Future\\" continues the Chapman tradition of writing straightforward, but heartfelt songs about love like \\"Sing For You\\", \\"Thinking Of You\\" and \\"A Theory\\". Or wry takes on celebrity like \\"I Did It All\\". Or an analysis of deities on \\"Save Us All\\". Chapman is a master wordsmith, and while the songs on \\"Our Bright Future\\" may not grab you quite the way the songs did on her debut, she does continue to grow and mature (although she was always mature).<br /><br />\\"Our Bright Future\\" is not as jubilant as its title suggests. Chapman is never one to really get all bright and happy. She takes more of a cautionary approach, a skepticism that has made her music more enduring than many of her contemporaries.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Our Bright Future\\" adds up:<br /><br />1988 Tracy Chapman: Five Stars<br />1989 Crossroads: Five Stars<br />1992 Matters Of The Heart: Four Stars<br />1995 New Beginning: Four Stars<br />2000 Telling Stories: Three Stars<br />2002 Let It Rain: Three Stars<br />2005 Where You Live: Four Stars<br />2008 Our Bright Future: Three and a Half Stars
B00127RAJY|5.0|The first time I did this workout I was dead! It was easy, fun, and got me sweating real quick! I love Jillian with her no-excuses attitude and her awesome body is a huge motivator. The moves are simple and easy but very effective. Each workout is 20 minutes and you'll definitely feel like you worked out really harder and longer. I have to shower after every single workout because I'm sweating like crazy! You wont be disappointed.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great CD. But in all honesty, the Goo Goo Dolls have not released enough truly solid albums to justify a greatest hits album, and even in doing so they curiously left out \\"Acoustic #3,\\" one of their staples.<br /><br />If, however, you just want what you hear on the radio and nothing else, go ahead and pick this up. But I encourage you to dig a little deeper, and actually make the effort to get to know the B-sides. You won't be disappointed, because most of their songs are as good as the singles.
0385339585|5.0|I have been pro and con with my reviews and opinions on previous Grisham novels I have read (7 in all). Even when I'm disappointed I still go back because I believe he is a smart and talented writer. I don't have enough words of praise for \\"The Testament\\". I am overwhelmingly shocked to find this was not made into a movie, it certainly read like one. It kind of reminded me of the Hepburn/Bogart classic \\"The African Queen\\", with all the class and richness. Highly recommend \\"The Testament\\"!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Amazing series, very historically accurate and great action sequences and story lines.  Highly reccommend!
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|Sure, the movie is there - and it's great.  In my opinion, should be up for best picture of 2008.    However, this item is the Special Edition DVD - and it's total crap.  The bonus DVD has very little on it, and what is there is entirely unintersting.  Nothing about Heath Ledger's performance, no comments at all from any of the cast on any topic, no comments from Nolan, very little breakdown of any special effects scenes, nothing on the film prep, rehearsals, sets, shots - just utterly, totally lacking.    I feel totally ripped off, I have to admit.  I was exciting about getting this package - and it's just a huge letdown.    Just buy the movie by itself - the bonus DVD is garbage.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|My initial evaluation of this flash gun is quite positive This unit is easy to use with huge and endless potentials. The menu system is very intuitive typical of nikon and I like the possibility of using this as master & remote making SU800 CLS functionality quite redundant. Over heating has not been an issue for me at least at this time and I can see myself using this flash more often than not.....
B000021Y7X|5.0|Saw this when it premired in a local theater and stuck around to see it two more times! Bought the VHS tape when it came out and later the DVD.

B000SX88VW|5.0|Classic Floyd experience. Most of the album makes chronoligical, evolutionary, etc sense- its a mixture of wish you were here and the wall for floyd fans. Roger does all the singing, but the lyrics are top notch as usual. Gilmour shredds on the guitar on dogs and pigs. Wright doesn't get a lot of airtime but he does have a jazzy keyboard solo on sheep.    Albumwise it's actually my favorite of Floyd's, but thats not because it has my ultimate favorite songs (Numb, Time), its because the flow of the music and the power of the words are better than all the other albums.     Things I might recommend to improve the album-  read Animal Farm (it's what the book is based off of)  and listen to it loud    The only bad things I've experienced is that the album flows so well that it feels very short. While there are 17 minute songs it still flies by too fast.    That's it. Go buy it
074357818X|5.0|I really, really like this book.  Much of the plot was about being both quietly and aggressively pursued by fear, staying focused on your journey while being tempted to give in, thinking outside of the box to survive, facing fear, and faith in a good, Higher Power. Pretty much all of the ingredients to a good read, in my opinion.<br /><br />I really appreciated the element of faith and the involvement of a good, caring Higher Power.  Even if you don't have a certain religion or faith, I think that you'd still enjoy the book.

B00026WUAU|5.0|There are already many excellent reviews of this album here, but Street Legal is such a great one that I feel the need to add my voice. When this album first came out (in 1978) I remember it really confusing people, especially reviewers, who gave it very mixed notices, not because they disliked it, I think, but because they simply didn't know what to do with such a work--it really doesn't sound much like anything in Dylan's previous output. This situation is really sad, for it helped sink the record, to the point where it's still not given anything approaching its due.     The album is basically a big funky brew of r&b, blues, soul, gospel, folk, rock-n-roll, and even a little Tex-Mex, that might best be described as a very hard-edged version of the Mussel Shoals sound (a softer, less effective version of this sound emerges on later albums such as \\"Slow Train Coming\\"). Most of this edge comes from Dylan himself, who is singing ferociously throughout, as well as deftly leading a fascinating band that features, in addition to the biting guitars and  swirling organs one would expect, sax (Stephen Douglas, if I remember correctly) and a line of excellent gospel backup singers.    None of this would matter much of course if the songs weren't up to snuff--and luckily the writing on this album is excellent from beginning to end. Other reviews here have done a good job of going thru each song, so I'll just say that Dylan's never written a more fascinating batch of tunes, or at least not ones with such breadth, which range from lilting ballads to brilliant, deliberately unwinding midtempo pieces to grinding blues. One song I will mention by name is \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\", a truly spooky border ballad that ranks amongst Dylan's best and most head-scratching tunes.    The only real problem I have with this album is the production, which is a bit muddier and more dense than it probably should have been. That said, I own the 1990 disc and the 2004 remaster may be better.    If you're into Dylan and don't have this album buy it! It's a damn good piece of music making.

0451207521|3.0|Follett as the author of perfectly researched historical plots, strong, complex characters and \\" chess -like \\" intelligent fast paced action.  The author has since ranged widely amongst a variety of subjects, leaving me disappointed with flatness of \\" Whiteout ' or \\" Code to zero \\". However, with \\"Jackdaws\\", Follett returns to World War II. Historical setting of French resistance and France just prior to the Invasion Of Normandy it is very well done. What leaves me disappointed is flatness of the characters. Follett starts strong describing not perfect, but highly interesting and somewhat controversial women that  were members of Jackdows. However, this characters, strengths and weaknesses, their talents and phobias seem to play no role in further development of the plot and in the final victory of the mission. All action and the plot is reduced to the dual between handsome, charming, brilliant and evil SS Officer - Dieter and beautiful, charming, brilliant and angelic British female....a bit old Follett plot begging for more depth and complexity.
0385751893|3.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is presented as a fable by the author, and if taken at face value, then it works. It tells the story of Bruno, the son of a high-ranking SS officer who is promoted to be the Camp Commandant of Out-with [Auschwitz] and moves his entire family, consisting of his wife, his 12-year-old daughter Gretel and 9-year-old son, Bruno from Berlin to the Polish camp. Once there, young Bruno finds his living conditions 'intolerable' compared to the luxurious life they led back in Berlin and misses his three best friends. Bruno yearns to return to the comfort and familiarity of Berlin, but then an afternoon exploration makes him feel better. He meets the boy on the other side of the fence, Schmuel, who is the same age as Bruno, who has the luxury of wearing striped 'pajamas' all day long, and who has many 'companions' to play with. Bruno appears to be very naive and does not seem to realise that his friend is actually a prisoner in a death camp, one who is constantly hungry and starving, and who is engulfed in despair. The boys form a friendship that develops into a deep bond and ends in one of the most heart-rending climaxes I've read in a book.<br /><br />Taken as a fable, the book is an excellent launching pad for discussions about the Holocaust, particularly as seen through the eyes of children. Though the protagonist in this book is nine years old, I would not recommend it for young readers due to the very sensitive nature of the topic. Instead, I think it is apt for older readers [perhaps ages 12 and up] who already have some understanding of what the Holocaust is about.<br /><br />That being said, the book is not without its problems. Having been a former History teacher with a keen interest in the Holocaust, I found quite a few historical inaccuracies that was jarring to read. Another reviewer has also elaborated on this.<br /><br />Firstly, young Bruno, being almost nine years old, and the son of a high-ranking Nazi, would in all probability have been a member of the Hitler Youth, and thus quite familiar with the anti-Jewish propaganda drummed into young members of the Reich. His naivete when it comes to the Jews [portrayed in the book as being unfamiliar with the race] is hard to believe. Secondly, children, especially those around Schmuel's age, would most certainly have been earmarked for extinction [gas chambers] as soon as they arrived. Schmuel's existence in the camp [for over a year in the book] seems miraculous [and perhaps not imposssible] but once again, quite implausible. Also, Schmuel and Bruno seem to meet almost every afternoon for a period as long as a year. Avoiding detection all that time seems to be another implausible plot point. There are some other parts that I found to be quite innacurate in terms of actual historical portrayal, but the ones I listed are my main grouses.<br /><br />Conclusion - this is a book that I'd recommend reading, if only because it does have a unique approach to the Holocaust [through the eyes of a young Aryan child] and the simple writing style will engage young readers [ages 12 and up]. Getting young readers interested in the topic and launching discussions on the Holocaust makes this a worthwhile read, but at the same time, caution needs to be exercised, as the book does give an almost simplistic [and at some points, inaccurate] views of the Holocaust.<br /><br />Note: This movie tie-in paperback edition does not come with an author interview and reading guide [found in the earlier edition]the Hitler Youth, and thus quite familiar with the anti-Jewish propaganda drummed into young members of the Reich.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|The title says it all.  This is a well written, produced and acted TV series that has kept me entertained for the past couple years.

If you like shows about ghosts, demons and vampires getting axed with a little humor thrown in every once in awhile, this collection is for you.

B001D6OKJ2|5.0|[[ASIN:B001D6OKJ2 Sunday at the Village Vanguard]] is an album that has gained iconic status among jazz recordings.  This material has been released in countless formats and incarnations.  I am happy to say that I own nearly all of them.  This is jazz that is immediate and accessible.<br /><br />I recently decided to compare this recording to the [[ASIN:B000AMJEKA The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961]] of the same performances.  That set has 3 disks of all the material available at that time.  The only portion missing, sadly, were takes on a lost reel that I am certain many music lovers would give much to locate.  The first take of \\"My Man's Gone Now\\" and some of the set ending theme were among the items lost on that tape that can be accounted for.<br /><br />So what of the comparison?  Well, the complete recordings clearly offer what the name implies ... complete recordings.  The first take of \\"Gloria's Steps,\\" which was interrupted by an apparent power and equipment failure, is indeed missed.  In some ways, that soft and easy first take is the one track I wish could have been somehow magically retrieved in its entirety.<br /><br />The other aspect of the complete recordings is that they also offer the opportunity to piece together the sets chronologically.  In that sense we get to hear the trio progress through the various sets, and the different angles they take on some of the key tunes recorded that day.  That is incredibly valuable for a student of this music.  This recording does offer us alternate takes of several key tunes, including \\"Gloria's Steps,\\" \\"Alice In Wonderland,\\" and \\"Jade Visions.\\"  The ordering here may be more palatable as an *album* experience.  But there is no substitute for the complete recordings.<br /><br />There is another minor difference I have noted between the two recordings, and I have yet to track down the reason for it.  The complete recordings definitely seem to have more of the ambient noise of the live recording.  This release seems to have a fuller sound to the instruments, though you can still hear the applause and movements of the crowd.<br /><br />In short, if you have to pick between the two I would still recommend the complete recordings over this release.  It sounds wonderful, but for just a little bit more you can have all the sets available.

0060594896|5.0|A dear friend of mine gave me this book for Christmas last year.  I value his opinion, but had told myself just the day before as I looked at my nightstand, \\"The last thing I need is another self-help book.\\"  Well, I was wrong.  This is an amazing book.  I read it through once.  Then I went back and started working the exercises.  Then I started reading a chapter each morning to motivate me.  I've never read \\"The Secret,\\" but from my understanding, this is \\"The Secret\\" with a business slant.  The Success Principles is a compilation of the best parts of self-help, motivational, and good business practices books.  I have referred the book to many people and have personally bought six copies to give to friends.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|DR. HORRIBLE is easily the most celebrated creation directly for the Internet.  GEMINI DIVISION has come out since DR. HORRIBLE and is getting some good reviews in some quarters, but it has garnered nothing like the praise.  Repeatedly over the years, Joss Whedon has managed to match or exceed expectations.  No wonder that he managed to do so again with this gem.  And it easily stands as the most remarkable thing that Neil Patrick Harris has done.<br /><br />It is nothing short of amazing how much on the cutting edge that either Whedon or his creations have been over the past 15 years.  He helped write the screenplay for the first computer animated film, TOY STORY.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER alone was an epic of \\"firsts.\\"  Buffy Summers was close to the first powerful female hero to be found on TV.  Xena beat her by a couple of years (though not if you count the BUFFY movie), but Xena seems to have influenced few if any subsequent female heroes, while Buffy seems to inform them all.  BUFFY pretty much invented the TV concept of the Body Count, whereby important and notable characters are killed off, completely upturning the prior convention that no recurring characters on a show were to meet untimely deaths).  BUFFY was the first series to successfully employ the long narrative arc, building entire seasons around a single story.  BUFFY was also the first series to be heavily downloaded on the Internet.  This took place because of the decision of the WB to pull two episodes off the schedule after the Columbine High School shootings.  The episodes were broadcast in Canada, where some fans made copies of them and uploaded them to the Internet.  As a result, \\"Earshot\\" and \\"Graduation, Part 2\\" became the first heavily downloaded episodes in the history of television.  Also, while BUFFY was not the first series to have a musical episode, \\"Once More With Feeling\\" was unquestionably the most successful.  And while other series came out on DVD prior to BUFFY, it was one of the series to find the pricing \\"sweet spot\\" of around $40.  Prior series like the STAR TREK and X-FILES franchises had been priced to high to generate big sales.<br /><br />Similarly, FIREFLY anticipated many of the alterations to Sci-fi that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA would wrought.  No aliens, low tech, no magic science, hand held cameras, use of zoom on both regular cameras and on CGI \\"cameras\\" would all be reemployed on BSG.<br /><br />And BUFFY also became the first TV series to be continued in comic form (ANGEL would follow shortly).  Many, many series have continued in noncanonical form, but this was the first series to continue in canonic fashion, with the creator at the helm.  Since the advent of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER Season 8 on Darkhorse comics several other TV creators have contemplated continuing their shows as a comic, including Rob Thomas (VERONIC MARS) and Bryan Fuller (the tragically cancelled PUSHING DAISIES).<br /><br />In other words, it is hardly surprising that Joss Whedon, who has been out in front on so many other projects, would be out in front on exploring just what you could do on the Internet.<br /><br />That this is good is hardly a surprise given the astonishing quality of \\"Once More With Feeling,\\" the great musical episode from BUFFY Season 6.  This has a far smaller cast, but what there is is outstanding.  As I said above, Neil Patrick Harris has never been this good before (and he has on several occasions expressed interest in a sequel, to which I reply, \\"Bring it on!\\").  He sings in a wonderfully unaffected light tenor and manages to express all the nuances of his character.  As a blogger who aspires to join the Evil League of Evil (led by Bad Horse -- at the end of the musical we discover that Bad Horse is, indeed, a horse), Harris couldn't be better.  Felicia Day, who played one of the potentials in BUFFY Season 7, was unexpectedly delightful as Horrible's love interest Penny.  And the always magnificent Nathan Fillion is wonderful inthe project's third major character and Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer.  There are also some great cameos by writers who have gone on to other television series, but who made their mark as writers on BUFFY, including David Fury (now a major contributor to 24) and Marti Noxon (now show runner of PRIVATE PRACTICE, formerly show runner of BUFFY in Seasons 6 and 7) as newscasters, and Drew Goddard (currently a writer on LOST, recently the writer of CLOVERFIELD, and director and co-writer with Joss Whedon of the forthcoming film THE CABIN IN THE WOODS) as \\"Fake Thomas Jefferson\\" of the Evil League of Evil.<br /><br />As befitting a Joss Whedon creation, this does not end as you think it will.  Some object to that.  I celebrate it.  The ending had far more of an emotional impact on me than I anticipated.  Joss Whedon has stated that as a writer it is his job not to always give his viewers what they think they want, but what they actually need.  That applies here.<br /><br />All in all, this is another amazing chapter is a long line of amazing creations by Joss Whedon, wonderfully performed and executed by some great performers.ter and Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer.

1416594884|4.0|A powerful story about a poor Chechen, the bastard son of a corrupt Russian General, who has suffered immensely in the hands of the Russians and the Turks and who ends up in Hamburg to reclaim his father's ill gotten gains which he intends to put to good use. He also wants to study medicine in order to help people. All Le Carre's characters, the Chechen, the German lawyer-ideologue and the failed British banker, despite their many clichés remain original and fresh, surreal yet real. The author manages to convey clinical detachment and objectivity behind which lies a deep concern about the world we live in. And reminds us of Plato's question: \\"who will protect us from our protectors\\"?
B001EN71CW|5.0|I agree completely with other reviewers that while the quality of the Blu-ray disc is better than the DVDs, it is not enough to justify the cost.  I own FIREFLY in both Blu-ray and DVD and while the Blu-ray is unquestionably better, it simply isn't sufficiently better to justify the cost.<br /><br />Frankly, unless the studios and electronics manufacturers make some immediate and drastic changes, I am not optimistic about Blu-ray surviving as a technology.  I have a Samsung 46\\" LCD television and both a Philips Up-Conversion DVD player (with HDMI cable) and a Sony Playstation 3 with both Up-Conversion capabilities and a Blu-Ray player.  When I first got the Blu-ray I was buying most movies and TV series on Blu-ray.  But after discovering that the improvement is slight while the costs remains absurdly high, I've largely gone back to buying DVDs.  For instance, I just bought THE DARK KNIGHT on regular DVD rather than Blu-ray.  And until the studios drop the cost of Blu-ray discs down to the level of DVDs, I'm not likely to buy many Blu-ray discs in the future.  I suspect that it costs the studios no more money to make a Blu-ray than to make a DVD (in fact, given the smaller size of most Blu-ray packages, it might be less expensive), so it is merely a way they utilize to gouge the consumer.  My greatest concern is that the studios are not dropping the costs of the Blu-ray discs to compare favorably to DVDs.<br /><br />In short, at this point the studios are simply not giving us enough motivation to buy Blu-ray discs.  I definitely regret spending over $50 to get FIREFLY on Blu-ray.  As I said above, until they drop the price of Blu-ray discs to the same level of DVDs, I'm not likely to get any more.  MAD MEN Season One came out with both Blu-ray and DVD priced the same.  This will be the lone instance where I'll buy Blu-ray until the prices drop.  The other exception might be if and when they bring BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER out on DVD.  The quality of the current DVDs is pretty low.  Right now when I watch BUFFY on my 1080 capable TV, it looks rough and grainy.  The same is true to a lesser degree of THE X-FILES.  But if by going back to the masters they can create a higher resolution image, I'd buy them.  But this is the exception and the rule it proves.<br /><br />If you don't own FIREFLY at all, I definitely recommend getting this on DVD instead of Blu-ray.  There is absolutely no question that this was potentially one of the most brilliant shows in the history of TV.  Even though there were only a handful of episodes completed, the FIREFLY universe was nonetheless evoked in astonishing detail.  All nine characters were brought to life in amazing detail.  A definite chemistry was created between the various members of the crew.  It is still extraordinary that FOX gave up on this so quickly.  The cast was amazing.  The writing was beyond brilliant.  The production values, given the relatively low budget, were impeccable.  Nearly six years after its cancellation it is still finding new fans and continues to delight its legion of fans.  So while I don't recommend anyone getting this on Blu-ray, I definitely recommend that anyone interested in quality TV getting it if they don't own it already.  Along with the recently and tragically cancelled PUSHING DAISIES and the high school series MY SO-CALLED LIFE and FREAKS AND GEEKS, it belongs on the shortest of short lists of the most horrible cancellations ever.<br /><br />The amazing thing is that FIREFLY lives on.  Fan demand resulted in the movie SERENITY, which primarily dealt with River's story, which would have been the main narrative engine of the show.  There is no immediate plan to make an additional movie, fans live on in hope that there will be another.  Whedon remains interested in making one and refuses to divulge a couple of the major remaining mysteries that attach to the series.  Whedon has written two prequel comic books extending the SERENITY story, THOSE LEFT BEHIND and BETTER DAYS.  Very soon the third SERENITY prequel will start appearing, A SHEPHERD'S TALE, which will tell Shepherd Book's secret.  But it is significant that Whedon persists in doing prequels.  He clearly wants to hold in reserve the major unanswered mystery, why Inara left her home planet and what her great secret is.  As long as Whedon holds onto that secret, he is clearly retaining some hope that he'll get an opportunity to tell at least one more story in the FIREFLY 'verse.third SERENITY prequel will start appearing, A SHEPHERD'S TALE, which will tell Shepherd Book's secret.

0316017922|4.0|The difficult truth is that human success, like human failure is a result of both nature and nurture. The quality of the seed and the opportunity offered by the ground in which it is planted. For some reason, it's hard for us to keep both of these things in mind.<br />Gladwell's book is a neatly-told reminder of the importance of nurture, but it is definitely not a 'proof' of anything. He picks for his cases only the ones that demonstrate his conclusion. Since the pendulum seems to be swinging in the direction of the 'great man' theory these days, Outliers is an interesting corrective. It may even provoke some school useful reforms.<br />Let's just not make too much of it.

B00008J2PG|5.0|Even after all these years [since the movie was first released], I find The Scarlet and the Black a riveting watch. Based on the true life exploits of Monsignor O'Flaherty [compellingly portrayed by Gregory Peck], the story recounts the events that unfolded during the Nazi occupation of Rome, led by SS officer Herbert Kappler [a rather evil and calculated performance by Christopher Plummer]. Though the Vatican is neutral during the war, the Pope and his staff find it incredibly difficult to remain calm when the Nazis begin terrorizing Rome's inhabitants [both Jews and non-Jews] and even torture a priest of the Church.<br /><br />Gregory Peck plays Monsignor O'Flaherty, a high-ranking and influential priest in the Vatican who actively helps escaped Allied POWs, Jewish refugees and anyone who is trying to flee the Nazis' reign of terror. As a man of the cloth, he helps all those who are in need, without reservations and one event in the movie [where he helps with gathering funds to 'ransom' the Jews of Rome] is particularly compelling. Based on real historical events, this active role played by the Monsignor is even more significant given the Catholic church's rather passive role during the Nazi reign of terror in Occupied Europe [as attested by historical accounts]. Placing himself in mortal danger, and under the scrutiny of the Gestapo [the Nazi Secret Police], Fr O'Flahery brazenly and cunningly carries out his heroic acts [at times under the very noses of the Nazis] and earns the wrath of SS Col Herbert Kappler, the Nazi in charge of Occupied Rome. Kappler as portrayed by Christopher Plummer is the epitome of Nazi cunning and totally without remorse, stooping to execute a priest, backing out of a verbal promise [assuring safety] to the Jewish community etc. Though he begins his 'reign' over Rome with much confidence, he loses his composure and self-assuredness as Fr O'Flaherty and company manage to get away from the Nazis time and time again.<br /><br />The story is well-told, with compelling human drama and lots of action. The suspense is built-up from the beginning, and the climax of the movie - a showdown between Kappler and Fr O'Flaherty is absolutely mind-blowing. It addresses an important question: in the face of so much evil, can one, especially a man of the cloth, overcome his personal convictions and extend mercy, or is he, in the end, merely human?<br /><br />Though the protagonist in this movie is a Catholic priest, there is no real focus on religion here and only minor religious references. This is quite a feat given that the movie is centered in Rome and the Vatican! A must-see for fans of WW II dramas, especially those who are keen on real-life dramas centering on the Nazi occupation of Europe. Highly recommended!ith compelling human drama and lots of action.

Almost forty years of Afghan history is told through the eyes of two very different women, whose destiny becomes interwoven by their losses, and whose very survival comes to depend upon their relationship.    The plot's a series of cliffhangers, the characters are fully developed, and the glimpses into an unfamiliar culture are fascinating. Add that Hosseini has the voice of a poet, and you have an unforgettable novel.

B001AT4Y84|2.0|If only someone could create a real Terminator with time-traveling capacity, I wish he'd go back in time and destroy this script before it was ever turned into a movie.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, this movie was more Arnold's big bang exit from Hollywood into politics than a worthy addition to the Terminator saga. The story really ended, with all ends neatly tied, with T-2. Terminator 3 is more like Karate Kid 3, a movie that had no reason for being and only served to take away from its predecessors.<br /><br />Many have harsh opinions about James Cameron but the man could tell a story with meaning, his absence from both writing and directing this movie is absolutely obvious. The first two Terminators were about love, the will to survive and the fact that fate does not have the last say: The future is not written, you can choose differently. If you take T3 at its word, it tells you precisely the opposite.<br /><br />I'm willing to ignore Edward Furlong was not chosen to reprise John Connor and neither do I have a problem with the character as a washed-up, broken man haunted by his past. Harder to swallow is Linda Hamilton's absence from the movie, she's just too important a character. So we are given new actors, new characters and the story which was neatly packaged in T2 is broken out of its box and totally prostituted here. To add insult, neither Nick Stahl nor Claire Danes are allowed by the script to take up their mantle and shape their futures, it is all left up to Arnold to do most of the fighting.<br /><br />Then we're dealt another punch: In spite of what the previous movies built up to, John Connor is not the real threat to Skynet, it is and always was, his wife Kate! At that point I rolled my eyes and waited for the movie to end. When the scene where an older John Connor raises his hands in victory after the end of the future war, the bad make-up and fake beard on Nick Stahl didn't even manage to elicit a groan at that point.<br /><br />The new T-X is a gorgeous looking Kristanna Loken who is neither threatening nor intimidating, just a blatant gimmick! Seriously, how intimidating was Arnold on the first? How creepy was Robert Patrick on T-2? But Loken? Well, this \\"Terminatrix\\" (I kid you not - that is the name of the new model) is a more advanced Terminator and is able to \\"speak\\" to machines, like sending unmanned police cars against the good guys. How can a computer program speak to cars, which are mechanical and analog, the movie does not explain, nor is it that important because it is just boring.<br /><br />The movie merits at least one star because the special effects are excellent and the acting was as good as can be expected from the horrid direction and script. Ironically this was Arnold's last big movie to date and he looked like he could act. No Robert de Niro acting, mind you, but a long way from Hercules, his first movie. The rest is an insult to the original story.<br /><br />In the end, there are those like James Cameron who will create a screenplay and movie appropriate to the times with themes that are timeless. Then there are those like the writers and director of this movie who will prostitute that same story, piggyback on its success, contribute nothing but in fact take away from it just to make money off it. The medium \\"Man vs Machine\\" is trite now; it wasn't so when Cameron wrote T1. In fact, T1 (which came out in '84) was more about nuclear Cold War angst than fear of machines. Even in '92 -when T2 came out- it was still appealing, but now after the Matrix movies the genre has lost its newness. You can't really blame a machine since it's not a free agent, it's just a system gone haywire and by taking away all the meaning and layers of the previous movies (romance, gutsy characters, philosophical implications) T3 isn't much more fun than an episode of Robot Wars on TV. It parasites off T1 and T2's virtues, forgets its themes and gives us car chases instead hoping we would not notice thedifference. This movie is Exhibit A in what gives Hollywood an undeservedly bad name.<br /><br />Jerry Seinfeld, when commenting on why he had decided not to continue shooting Seinfeld, said that a performer must know when to gracefully bow out. That sometimes giving more, even when the audience asks for it, only takes away from the show you've just done. If only those involved in this movie had had that much sense.llywood an undeservedly bad name.

He travels to France, against his father's, wishes to become a truly revolutionary Bohemian writer.  He becomes swept up in a life of women, drink and drama.  Lurhmann turns this tale into a musical of... unique standing.  Taking classic rock-n-roll songs and rearranging them to form a truly entertaining and innovative, Lurhmann leads the way into the dark, seductive world of the Moulin Rouge.

0679422714|5.0|I find it incredible that so many clearly intellectual people and 'experts', as well as laymen, appear to be lining up to cast aspersions on this book.  They have the luxury of doing this, living in the West where freedom of speech allows the robust defense of the worst of despots.  I think that many of these reviews demonstrate the reality of the myth of Mao, the pseudo-deity, as so many people seem to be dismissing this book because it did not search for the good in Mao, or consider that his policies were due to a genuine belief that his actions were best for his people.    Hitler believed that the Jews and many other groups were subhuman, and that it was best for the German people for them to be removed - does this make his actions less evil or more justifiable?  I think not.  So why should this argument be made by so many regarding Mao?  Germany is now a strong country with influence and affluence; does this mean that Hitler had a positive contribution to Germany's unity and current power?  There are some that might say so (let me be clear, I would not be one of them), but I don't think they would be given the credence that the reviewers of this book are for saying similar things about Mao.    Mao was well aware of the human cost of his policies - about the endless murders, the torture, the rape, the starvation, the absolute wretchedness of his own people - and he didn't care, he actually reveled in it, and only cared that he got what he wanted, which was unreasoning, absolute power and deification.  Even if his policies had been motivated by thinking that he knew best for the Chinese people, so what?  If one of our own leaders aspired to this, we would be vociferous in our criticism; why have a different standard for Mao?    My view is that Jung Chang has written an uncompromising and courageous biography of Mao, based on personal experience and research, that will hopefully continue to expose him for the despot he was.

B001GZ6QBU|1.0|This film is only for those who \\"must see\\" all of the Christian Bale Batman series, and have been suckered in by the hype.      Unlike his Batman; The Beginning, where Christian was allowed to act as well as perform action, Dark Knight only requires action scenes.  The rest of the time he stands around befuddled, delivering dialog that makes you want to run your cat's claws across a black board.      And Heath?  Oscar nomination?  Please, everyone calm down and get a grip.  Every Joker scene is repetitive -- there is no depth of acting -- he does the exact same slobbering delivery in each scene.  At most, his Joker characterization is annoying.  To say the least, it is boring.    And the action scenes?  Predictable.  Say what you will about the Mission Impossible series, but their actions scenes always carried an element of excitement and surprise.  The Dark Knight actions scenes are routine, and carry an element of looking at your watch and yawning.  Proof:  The two ferry boats scene.  Did you care in the least which boat blew-up?  Were you on the edge of you seat as the explosive clock ticked down?  Now go back and look at the ferry boat scene in War of the Worlds.    Watch Dark Knight if the rental price is right, or a friend has it.  Just so you can say you saw it.
B001F290E4|5.0|I have never heard Seal sing before, heard him on the Ellen show and decided to buy his album.  Boy am I ever glad I did.  Love the huskie attributes in his voice.  Loved his choice of songs. I didn't find any of the song on the album not worth listening .  I loved it and can't wait to buy more music by Seal.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I have been waiting for another Enya CD and it doesn't disappoint. I was a little surprised that some of it is Christmas and some not. But I still like it a lot.

0312370849|5.0|I was hooked from the first page! Short chapters alternate between the past, 1942, and the present until the two narratives intersect. It was the first book I've read in awhile that I couldn't wait to get back to, after I had been forced to put it down! Other reviews cover the story line adequately, so, I'll just say that if you enjoy this book, try Cecilia Samaritan's books next. (Broken Paradise and Tarnished Beauty)
1416594884|3.0|This was a decent spy novel.  I rated it a 3 because the plot was a bit thin, but I did enjoy reading it.  Seems like it was partly just trying to capitalize on 9/11 war on terror type stuff, another \\"there are new rules now\\" plotline.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Once i heard this new album, I can't stop listing to it. Maybe it's not as good as their past release. But still it's worth to have. Seen Slipknot in concert many times. Never got tired of them. This cd is more of a Death Metal sound. Which makes it good. People who don't like it should go back soft wimping rock.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This suberb audio CD is the culmination of the first studio project by The Eagles in almost 30yrs. It's amazing that The Eagles are still popular after more than 30yrs of recording and performing, especially since they don't debase their professionalism by smoke, fireworks, and hippity hoppity choreography. Don Henley and Glenn Frey are task masters by demanding near perfect adherence to the music score and vocal harmonies. This album is a Must for any Eagles fan. My personal favorite cuts are \\"Do Something\\", \\"I don't want to hear any more\\", \\"Waiting in the weeds\\" along with their new standard \\"Busy being fabulous\\".
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Love this cd but kind of freaked out by the 15 minute song that has silence for most of it.
0956010903|5.0|I admit that I am one such fan, though the $100.00 price tag and the state of economy, gave me pause.  I went ahead a bought the collector's edition because I really wanted to see the book in the form that she intended it to be.  However, I so wanted to read the tales that I could not wait until the CE arrived from Amazon.  So I went out and bought the standard edition as well.      I just compared to two editions and found some unexpected differences.  Beyond the metal corners and the reprint of Rowling's handwritten introduction, found only in the collector's edition, the standard edition does not have all of Rowling's illustrations!  For instance, in The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the illustrations of the \\"pot, slipper and note,\\" (page 27 of CE), as well as the \\"wizard (son) and women with the baby,\\" (pg. 32) are missing.  The illustration of the \\"warlock courting the maiden\\" (pg. 90) in The Warlock Hairy Heart -  a piece that I thought was particularly beautiful - is nowhere to be found in the standard edition either.  So, if you are still debating whether you should spend the money on the CE, you may want consider how important the illustrations are to you.      BTW, while I understand that certain sacrifices had to made for the standard edition, I don't think it was really fair to the standard edition buyers to remove actual material from Rowling's work - even if they were just the illustrations. . . . Yeah, I know the Editors, nor Rowling, asked for my opinion, but I thought I would give it anyway.  Take it for what it is worth.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This is not a slasher movie. If it was there would be about 2hrs less dialogue and triple the body count. There is absolutely no pathos to this movie either. What if fails to accomplish by sharing the joy of a psycho who likes killing with his car, it fails to turn over when the girls start chasing the psycho. The dialogue is much like watch a very shrivelled, ugly person masturbate for 113 minutes while the eye candy saves nothing. If you have a choice between talking to a vapid moron with no sense of reality and a vast case of apathy or watching this movie, shoot the moron, burn the movie go out and get a few beers. There is absolutely nothing about this movie worth recommeding except NOT WATCHING IT. If you do, at least fast forward and save yourself 45minutes of your life;)
0790734850|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. I've watched it 3 times. Each time I see something I didn't notice before.
B001GKJ2F2|1.0|What a wretched waste of time. Did Angelina need cash to help feed her brood? Can't see any other reason to be part of this mess. Calling the plot \\"threadbare\\" would be an insult to threadbare plots. Over-the-top action sequences are fine, but not when they pass into oh-give-me-a-break territory. Obviously designed to appeal to the short-attention-span, video-game-addicted generation.
B0014I4KIK|2.0|I had heard a lot about Duffy before I purchased this. I was disappointed. I didn't care for her singing or music. I listened to the CD several times and it didn't \\"click\\" with me.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Typical Stanley Kubrick movie,very well done in respect to detail and knowledge of that era. Just a few bloopers,but you have to look for them.The price is right from AMAZON as usual,a good buy.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|the movie was well done and cimatrograph was excellent this is what made the movie ,also the fact that it was it i 7.1 made the movie bring out alot more sound with the more channels
B000028U0Y|3.0|I'm not a big fan of live recordings and now I know why.  Too much chatter in the songs and the sound quality suffers.  If you're a big Johnny Cash fan though you might like this for your collection.
6304698682|5.0|Old Clint really delivers in this movie. Justice is served to a company of blast miners who try to drive out a town of prospectors. Clint truly is the Pale Rider....his name was Death and Hell followed with him.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Everyone wanted them to go back to their roots...and as far as song composure, this is the closest they've been since Justice.  The Black disc had a \\"THUMP\\" to the sound...the stuff prior to that may have had better tunes, but the recording never really captured the low bottom thump.  So, this disc pretty much does the same.      As far as the actual songs go...they are decent.  Some tunes are extended with no real purpose, but just to have those long jamming songs.  I have yet to hear anyone say \\"WOw! Check out this riff!\\" or \\"Lars sure pounds on this!\\" or even, \\"I have this song on constant repeat!\\"  There is no real memorable moments.      As I mentioned, the songs are decent.  I dig Jame's voice and nothing sounds too polished like most other vocalists.  It's the rawest part of the disc.      If you want decent metal tunes at a sub par to par level, then this will digest well for you.  Don't expect to be blowin' away.  Funny how money can buy almost anything, but that old passion.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I bought the CD for a few of the better known songs and now am in love with the lesser known ones.  This is a great CD at a great price!
B001HXG8PK|3.0|This is great music, but it only adds a half disc of new material since the last release for at least (depending on what Amazon's current price is) $30 extra, which leaves me feeling screwed for buying the first disc, which is now assimilated into this set as the first of the two discs.<br /><br />As said, the music is excellent. It is experimental and jarring, as any music telling the story of the Joker ought to be, but everything about this collection screams an overpriced and rushed attempt to cash in on the success of the film.<br /><br />The picture book, as well as the remixes, are useless and the tracks aren't in order. (Can someone please post the chronological order online?) In addition, many people have already pointed out that this is not the complete score that was recorded for the film so there are still extra pieces of it as yet unreleased.<br /><br />A $60, incomplete, out of order score? Why?<br /><br />Three stars for a top-notch recording. And minus two for the mistakes made in packaging, arranging and pricing this set.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|How people can criticize this album is beyond me. I was in line to buy it after waiting for what seemed like forever. DC really shows he can portray his feelings through music. I agree with others that he does not hit the high notes and bring out the roughness of his voice, but I do not think this album was meant to be that way. Considering he wrote most of the songs on this album I think David is trying to relay a message about how life is and how he feels about it. I think we need to give him a chance and see what his next album will bring us. May God bless his brother and David for being such a believer in him.
B00000F7MS|5.0|THE JUNGLE BOOK was the last movie that Walt Disney directly oversaw. The finished picture in no way resembles Rudyard Kipling's original story, as Disney felt this was too dark for a cartoon. With top notch songs like \\"The Bear Necessities\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Like You,\\" talented performers and animation that was part Xerox, part hand drawn, \\"The Jungle Book\\" is a fitting career closer from the greatest name in family motion picture entertainment, Walt Disney.<br /><br />This movie is also available on [[ASIN:B000OLGCI4 DVD]].<br /><br />After \\"Jungle Book,\\" the next Disney animated feature was THE ARISTOCATS (1970).  ([[ASIN:6303983812 VHS edition]])  ([[ASIN:B000XUOIQ4 DVD edition]])<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film research website.<br /><br />(7.6) The Jungle Book (1967) - voices of: Phil Harris/Sebastian Cabot/Louis Prima/George Sanders/Sterling Holloway/J.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|My daughter wanted this movie for a long time, and the previews seems really funny. After I bought it however, she lost interest pretty quickly. The movie starts how being funny, then it gets kind of boring, and Ratty turns into a total snob towards his family. In the end however the movie ends well with everyone happy and Ratty making up with his family. Overall I think the movie was overated.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Just amazing...despite being the best film of the year the look of it on Blu-Ray is unbelievable.  If your not watching BR you are missing out big time...and w/ most players right now at about $[...] bucks there is no excuse not to own one.  Do your family a favor and let this be a Santa gift this xmas.  The age of Blu-Ray has arrived!<br />The DARK KNIGHT rules!
B001C46P2A|3.0|Yes, the scenery is grand and the scale of the production likewise, but overall, \\"Australia\\" simply failed to deliver.  I guess you could describe it as an epic.  At nearly three hours, it delivers on this front!  But still....it failed to deliver any sort of knockout punch.<br /><br />The film is set during the early years of the Second World War in both Darwin and the outback reaches of Australia's Northern Territory. Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to a huge cattle station called Faraway Downs which is being managed by her husband.  She arrives to find her husband murdered and she thence becomes involved with some very shady businessmen.  They want her property and hope to see her on the next plane back to England.  The male love interest is High Jackman who plays \\"Drover\\" which is a description of his job but also, for the film, the only name that he is given.  The pair seems to bond well on screen.<br /><br />The rest of the film is the basic love story set against a stunning scenic back drop.  There is also a back story of the \\"stolen generation\\" where the young aboriginal boy, Nullah, steals the show.  It is he rather than Kidman or Jackman who is the real star of the show.<br /><br />Overall, I found this film disappointing.  It was clich&eacute;d and predictable.  However, I suspect that overseas audiences will warm to it.  Horses for courses.
0064431789|5.0|childhood classic, what else is there to say. aweome book for any child or parent!
1932100660|5.0|This is a very good and informative book.  Really makes me mad how the drug and food companies have duped us all, because of their greed.  Also, mad at myself for all the bad habits I have formed with my eating.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Who are you kidding? You know exactly what you're buying.    The Dark Knight, one of the greatest comic book movies ever made, record breaking records, critical acclaim, brilliant performance.    The catch? This set is awfully lacking in special features. Short clips  about the sound effects (7 minutes)... and the general theme of the movies (17 minutes). Yup that's right, the theme.    No special effects movie magic, behind the scenes, mechanics, interviews. Just trailers and viral faux news trailers that were free. Oh, and IMAX clips which are so useful on your regular TV.    Only redeeming quality of this special edition is that it's dirt cheap and the digital copy doesn't hurt.    Conclusion for this item: Great Movie, sorely lacking in special feature.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|The third album from Keane zaps in from 1989, or like a branch from [[ASIN:B0002858YS The Killers]] new wave cactus. \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" comes awash in reverberated synths and [[ASIN:B00009L1OA Duran Duran]] beats. While it seems an odd tangent from the thoughtful [[ASIN:B000FBHT1C Under the Iron Sea]], it's hardly as great a blaspheme as some reviewers here make it out to be. Instead, \\"PS\\" is a well constructed piece of pop, strong enough to rest next to such current stars as Coldplay's [[ASIN:B000RPTQ1C Viva La Vida]] or [[ASIN:B000F3UADO Snow Patrol.]]<br /><br />The opening song is a case in point. \\"Spiralling\\" is a playful, danceable number ala David Bowie's [[ASIN:B00001OH7Z Let's Dance]]. With chipper \\"woooo!'s\\" and a funky drum line, it's their best single to date. The follow-up, \\"The Lovers Are Losing,\\" is almost as good and a bit less poppy. There's also the expected piano ballad, \\"You Don't See Me,\\" reminiscent of Keane's previous albums.<br /><br />This is an album eager to please. If you're a fan of [[ASIN:B000FVQYYK Muse]], Coldplay or The Killers, this will suit you fine. If you're an older 80's buff with Simple Minds' [[ASIN:B0000793ZB Once Upon a Time]] or DD' [[ASIN:B00005BJ9W Rio]] in your well worn CD case, you'll be in sync with \\"Perfect Symmetry.\\"
B001ANE3EA|5.0|Simply put, for the price it cannot be beat... Just get this and you'll be glad...<br /><br />I would have easily paid twice as much...<br /><br />On a side note:  I wish more bands would release Deluxe editions like this with the music videos and a decent live concert...<br /><br />sit back and give your self an hour on the couch to enjoy the concert DVD... you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I personally can apprieciate the set list, unlike others here........
0810995212|2.0|The feeling you get from the sum of the reviews is \\"Buy this book for the pictures and forget the text\\".  Only trouble, though, is that the pictures are not well scanned, not well digitally restaured and not well set up for print, and not at all well printed.  \\"Not well\\" is in some cases not a strong enough negative.  This is such a let-down! And we waited 30 years for such a book. The Cutlers probably changed their names and went in exile, red-faced and feeling guilty as hell!  I'd buy this book all over again anytime, though, because of the art of Leyendecker. But only until someone comes up with better reproductions.
0321525655|5.0|I have discussed this book with a number of colleagues who are teachers and also conference presenters, and we all agree- Presentation Zen is a must-have for anyone who ever has to give a presentation, and the definition of presentation here could be so broad as to include almost any situation where effective communication is the goal.      A few examples of the sorts of useful lessons found in the book:  -in the preparation stage, there is great value in getting started without the aid of presentation software, for even the templates of PowerPoint can have an undue influence on how we organize our message (and who decided that the only way to present textual information is in the form of \\"Title, Bullet, Bullet\\" anyway?)  -replacing tired old slide backgrounds with vivid images that bleed off the page brings dynamism, allowing for contrast and making messages memorable  -when determining the text for each slide, less is more.  Filling a slide with the speakers' notes only makes for excess `noise' as listeners try to both read and listen at the same time, skills that are not as compatible as it might seem    As a book on presentation should, Presentation Zen makes its points clearly and memorably.  While reading it I could hardly wait to revisit my old PowerPoints armed with the simple but powerful techniques I found.
B000059ZIC|5.0|At the moment I'm listening (on the radio) to the Shlomo Mintz/Itamar Golan recording of Sonata No. 1 and it's all too slow and earth-bound for my taste. It's as though the musicians are driving home the point that this is some of the most beautiful music from the romantic era. But for me it doesn't work to play these sonatas with any sort of restraint. I have fond memories of an LP of Menuhin and Kentner, both completely carried away by the music's sheer ecstasy (Brahms must have been unbelievably happy when he wrote both the first and second sonatas) and this CD is the only one I've heard that comes close to Menuhin and Kentner. I might even prefer it to Menuhin and Kentner if I had the time to find the LP and go to all the trouble inherent in playing vinyl discs. I didn't choose this performance; I inherited it from my sister, and I wish I had asked her (when she played it for me on my last visit to her home) why she chose it in preference to others.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. Based on true events, and Steve McQueen,  Dustin Hoffman made it great. Just wonderful. I have watched it 10 or mor times. Thank you.
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|Love this movie and will get it when the real \\"special edition\\"  comes out!   Completely pissed off just knowing blue ray gotted more special features...

B0018CWEZ8|5.0|LOST Season 4 started off with a bang.  In the final episode of Season 3, we see Jack finally getting an opportunity to go back home but having that opportunity being taken away from him.  We see the Others attack the camp of where the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 were staying but most of all, a significant death of a main character.  But what was even more surprising for everyone was to see Jack and Kate several years in the future.  With Jack telling Kate that they need to go back.<br /><br />This left fans with a significant hint that there are survivors who made it off the island.  But who were they?  Also, who will be rescuing the survivors or more like, are they even there to save them?<br /><br />There are so many things that happened in Season 4 that it would be too difficult to explain but I can tell you that the whole season was exciting and despite the writer's strike possibly hindering the amount of episodes in the season, \\"LOST\\" was able to capitalize with quality over quantity in a total of 13 episodes and boy did they deliver.<br /><br />\\"LOST - THE COMPETE FOURTH SEASON\\" features the following episodes:<br /><br />  1. The Beginning of the End<br />  2. Confirmed Dead<br />  3. The Economist<br />  4. Eggtown<br />  5. The Constant<br />  6. The Other Woman<br />  7. Ji Yeon<br />  8. Meet Kevin Johnson<br />  9. The Shape of Things to COme<br />  10. Something Nice Back Home<br />  11. Cabin Fever<br />  12. There's No Place Like Home (Part 1 of 2)<br />  13. There's No Place Like Home (Part 2 of 2)<br /><br />Again, I really don't want to spoil the season for anyone but I will say that the body count of this season is quite high and the amount of action is also quite high for the fourth season.  The storytelling was just awesome and the acting was well done.  Especially the final episode.  Absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />The video is featured in 1080p High Definition/1:78:1.  One of the first things you will notice is how the island just comes alive with the vibrant colors.  From the lush greens to the variation of blues from the sky to the ocean.  And yes, you will be able to see the pores, the wrinkles of each actor.  The picture quality was absolutely beautiful.  I did see a few scenes (low-light) where there was considerable noise.  But only a few scenes.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />The audio features are English 5.1 uncompressed (48khz/16-bit) and English and French in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish in Dolby Digital 2.0.  During the action scenes or when you hear the music during a suspenseful scene, that is when you hear the audio being utilized.  Especially for this season due to the amount of explosions.  But overall, the audio is primarily dialogue.  You won't hear birds chirping or the oceans waves pounding from the island, but after watching the featurettes and the challenges of filming in public beaches and areas near traffic, I can understand the crew trying to make sure the dialogue came out clear and not trying to incorporate another noises that could have hindered the dialogue.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"LOST - THE COMPLETE SEASON FOUR\\" definitely is full of special features.  Included are:<br /><br />  * LOST in 8:15 - Learn about \\"LOST SEASONS 1-3' in 8:15<br />  * The Right to Bear Arms - Guns are used a lot in \\"LOST\\" but because they are on an island, who has to track who has what weapon and how many weapons there are.  This featurette was quite interesting.<br />  * The Freighter Folk - A look at the new faces on this third season of people on that freighter<br />  * The Island Backlot: Lost in Hawaii - A fantastic featurette that is quite lengthy and shows how certain scenes have come to life on \\"LOST\\".  How certain countries around the world were all filmed in Hawaii and how post-production came through to make it look like it was filmed elsewhere. Very entertaining featurette.<br />  * The Oceanic Six: A Conspiracy of Lies - Avery interesting 20+ minute documentary about those who challenge the inconsistencies of the Oceanic 6 survivors and research disputing the survivor's stories.  Very interesting!<br />  * Offshore Shoot - The building and shooting on the freighter<br />  * Lost - The Missing Pieces - These \\"MOBisodes\\" were featured on abc.com and there are certain scenes not shown on \\"LOST\\" that definitely shows missing pieces from previous seasons that actually make you think and wonder of past storylines.  Without spoiling this part for for anyone, I will talk about one which took place in the early parts of Season 1 between Sun and Michael.  Sun was burying her California ID which she was going to use after separating from her husband.  But Michael arrives and really listens to her.  The two nearly get romantic.  You never see this on Season 1.  You get a feeling that perhaps Michael may like Sun but you never see anything happen.  But after seeing this one MOBisode, you actually see both of them nearly kissing.<br />  * Soundtrack of Survival: Composing for Character, Conflict & the Crash - This section was on how the music is scored for \\"LOST\\" but also featuring the live performance of the Honolulu Symphony Pops.  The Blu-ray version features more live performances including \\"The Others\\" (uncut).<br />  * LOST on Location - Behind-the-scenes of the cast and crew<br />  * Course of the Future: The Definitive Flash-Forwards<br />  * LOST Bloopers<br />  * Deleted Scenes<br />  * Audio Commentaries - LOST fans will love the commentaries by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse.  The two have always had this cool chemistry and humor during their discussions since the first year and their old LOST podcasts and it continues.  More insight on the show and inside jokes.<br />  * SeasonPlay: This technology allows people to watch the episodes like watching it on television and even if you eject your Blu-ray to watch something else, when you put it back in to your player, it will remember where you last left off.<br />  * And much more...<br /><br />Like previous \\"LOST\\" Seasons on DVD and Blu-ray, there are also Easter Eggs.

B001L5Q5O8|5.0|I have to admit that I have recently joined the Taylor Swift bandwagon after listening to her album \\"FEARLESS\\".  I was very impressed by her beautiful vocals, the fact that she writes her own music and she is also a musician.<br /><br />So, when her 2007 Target-exclusive holiday E.P. \\"The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection\\" was finally released on digital online music stores on December 2nd, I have had this E.P. on rotation and continue to listen to it heavily.<br /><br />The first track \\"Last Christmas\\" features a cover of the popular holiday song sung by \\"Wham\\".  The song has been covered by so many artists and some are good and some are just bad.  Fortunately, Taylor Swift's version is on the good side and a nice blend of her country music style with the addition of strings and bells.<br /><br />The second track \\"Christmases When You Were Mine\\" is an original song on the album and I love this track.  The song is a sad track about not being with that special someone any longer for Christmas.  A beautiful track that is my favorite on the E.P.<br /><br />The third track \\"Santa Baby\\" is always a fun track to listen to and to hear Taylor Swift singing this song is quite fun and enjoyable.  A track that has more of a country-driven musical style.  All in all, a fun, enjoyable and catchy track!<br /><br />The fourth track \\"Silent Night\\" is a beautiful track that has an arrangement slightly different from what most people know the song.  But done very well.  Beautiful!<br /><br />The fifth track \\"Christmas Must Be  Something More\\" features an original song written by Swift.  Another well-written and well-sung track by Taylor.<br /><br />The sixth and final track is \\"White Christmas\\" which is an acoustic guitar driven track.  Another cool holiday Swift song to end the E.P.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic Taylor Swift holiday album.  I only wished it was a full-length album because I was definitely craving for more.<br /><br />As a young artist who is multi-talented, it's great to have the opportunity to enjoy her album \\"FEARLESS\\" and her holiday collection released digitally for the holidays.  Even though this came out last year, for many of us who didn't purchase the CD when it was released in Target, it's just great to have this available now digitally.<br /><br />For those wondering about this album, all six tracks are just wonderful.  My personal favorite is \\"Christmases When You Were Mine\\" and \\"Santa Baby\\" but overall, all tracks on the album were pretty good.<br /><br />All in all, a cool holiday E.P. and another Taylor Swift album that I can't get enough of.holiday collection released digitally for the holidays.

0891419195|5.0|Haunting.<br />Mr. Sledge\\"s reminisces of WW2 Pacific combat is one of the 3 best memoirs in that genre.  The other two being William Manchester's Goodbye Darkness, and Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow.  War is ugly, messy, misery and a terrible thing, but the courage and sacrifice of the warriors is the beauty of it all.  It is utter madness that muddles the mind, yet brings clarity of thought to a razor's edge.  It dulls one's sensibilities yet heightens the senses to maximum perception.  With the Old Breed is gritty realism, that will assault one's reality with the true nature of combat without philosophical metaphors.  It is love, hate, disgust, kindness, sympathy, revulsion, and understanding wrapped in the simple prose of one who has seen the utter madness of combat up close and personal.  Mr. Sledge graphically brings the sounds, sights, stink, and corruptions of the battlefield to the written page and slaps the reader in the face with the reality of it all.  At times it is revolting but yet it is ALL true.  The ambivalence of combat is the true mystery of its schizophrenic nature:  To be drawn to it and repulsed at the same time its mystique.  To use Mr. Paul Fussell's own words, \\"It is about the mystique of killing to avoid being killed, torturing to avoid being tortured.\\"  The front line is both a place of passion and madness.  As Mr. Sledge said,  \\"[combat] made savages of us all.  We existed in an environment totally incomprehensible to men behind the lines...\\"  And so it was at Peleliu and Okinawa, where Mr. Sledge, \\"tasted the bitterest essence of war, the sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered, and it filled me with disgust.  Furthermore, Mr. Sledge opines, \\"We were surrounded by maggots and decay .  Men struggled and fought and bled in an environment so degrading I believed we had been flung into hell's own cesspool.\\"<br />And yet, \\"War is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste.  Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it.  The only redeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and their devotion to each other.\\"<br />Maximum recommendation for anyone interested in actual combat in general and/or WW2 Pacific combat in particular.  BE WARNED this is an extremely graphic memoir.  It is NOT for the squeamish or faint of heart.  It is maximum realism and it is ugly at times.  Nevertheless is probably the best book ever written on the realities of war in the Pacific during WW2.<br />Finally, to sum up, \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.  With privilege goes responsibility.\\"  And as Wilfred Owen's poem \\"Insensibility\\" states, \\"those who feel most for others suffer most in war.\\"  Mr. Sledge suffered a great deal.it.

015206396X|5.0|I loved it!  I loved it!  I loved it!<br /><br />A wonderful book full of adventure, family, friends, and romance!  Katsa lives in a world where people can be born with special abilities.  Recognized by their unusual two colored eyes, these Gracelings have special abilties that take about 10-13 years to reveal themselves.  Katsa's showed up at age 10 when she accidently killed her cousin with one hit with her bare hand.  Her uncle, the king, saw potential and immediately made her his \\"Lady Killer.\\"  From then on, she was the weapon he selfishly used to his own greedy ends.  Up until 18, when Katsa put her foot down and said no more.  Of course, at this time in her life she also made friends with another unique Graceling.<br /><br />It was difficult putting this book down.  I finished it in only two days and then was disappointed when it ended.  I loved the characters, the strange world, and the good vs. bad plot, and I'm looking forward to reading more.  I'm not sure if Cashore plans to continue this storyline since the evil was defeated and everything was solved in the end, but I hope she brings us back to this facinating world.

1400063515|3.0|This book brings attention to some of our biases and how it effects our decisions. For example given enough monkeys (trillions) on typewriters one would write the Iliad but don't except the next book to be the Odyssey. This applies to traders giving enough some will experience random success for several years until they blow up.     Bottom line don't take randomness for success.     I'm not sure if you need to read a whole book to get the point. Especially since it's hard to implement as a trading strategy. I forget the exact quote but the author says don't expect to read the art of war and become a great general don't read my book as a practical guide to trading.    What's to say that Talib's trading strategy is randomness and one day will blow up.

0316017922|2.0|I found a couple of parts of the book interesting (the effect of the time of the year one is born on athletic success, the airline pilot culture and its effect on safety) but most of the book belabors the obvious: to be very successful you need talent, hard work, and luck. Surprise, surprise! The author often jumps to absurd generalizations (the \\"10,000 hour rule\\" for example). In particular, he seems to miss the reasons for Gates' success, even he spends several pages of the book discussing his life. Gates succeeded as entrepreneur because he realize the potential of personal computing. At the time the opinion of many executives of the computer industry was \\"why would anyone need a computer in their home?\\". So the key ingredient in his success was \\"thinking outside the box\\" or \\"being a visionary\\". This is true for most successful entrepreneurs, scientists, and technologists. The \\"wild creativity\\" as a factor for success does not appear in the book.

Didn't you listen to this over and over as a kid??\\"    i hope you'll buy this album and make it a christmas tradition in your home as well.    Happy Holidays!!

B001GZ6QEC|2.0|If you are twenty something and hopped up on enough testosterone this film may provide exactly the right stimulus to arouse a fixated, intense reaction from barely contained obsessions, unbearable cravings and suppressed playground rages. For everyone else, it will be a stone cold snooze. Ridiculous, shallow, silly, childish and ultimately boring. It is also by turns sadistic, cruel, mean spirited and filled with dark psycho babble that passes for profundity. There are so many other ways this story could have been told, ways that this film could have been made, interesting, innovative ways. Fanboys may salivate and rant and rage at any suggestion that this cinematic drug was not the ultimate high. But the question remains: Will the Batman idea ever produce a good movie? Not here, not yet.
031606792X|1.0|That's really all.  This last book in the series was really boring and REALLY stupid. I wish the series ended before this big disappointment.  The first three were fine.  Not fine literature, just fine entertainment.  The book was a big waste of time and money.
B001E5CH0G|3.0|Buddy (Will Ferrell) has been raised at the North Pole.  Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is very proud of his adopted son.  There's just one problem, Buddy is a human, not an elf.  In addition to his enormous size, he doesn't have the talents for toy making that all his friends do.<br /><br />When Buddy learns the truth, he sets out for New York to meet Walter (James Caan), his real father.  Walter works for a children's book publisher, but his ideas aren't selling.  He's also on Santa's (Edward Asner) naughty list.  And Walter isn't thrilled to discover he has an adult son, especially one who insists on dressing like an elf all the time.  Will he ever accept Buddy?  Will Buddy ever fit in New York?<br /><br />I avoided this movie because I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan.  This movie didn't exactly change my mind, but it wasn't as bad as I had feared.  In fact, it started out very cute and charming with several great laughs.  Then, Buddy moves to New York and things go downhill.  I'm not a big fan of embarrassment humor, and that's pretty much what happens as we watch Buddy making a fool out of himself time and time again.  I was cringing instead of laughing.<br /><br />Something happened, however, as we reached the climax.  While it was completely predictable, I found myself caught up in it.  And I found I cared for the characters.  I wanted to see them all happy.  Unfortunately, it did feel a little force, like it didn't quite follow from what came before.  But at the time I didn't care.<br /><br />This isn't the Christmas classic it wants to be.  It isn't a bad movie, but there are movies that are better.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|A perfect bluray disc with lots of bonus material. Perfect entertainment for the whole family. One of the best Pixar disney masterpieces so far.
B000022TSH|4.0|\\"Chinatown\\" represents an updating of the great noir films of the past such as \\"Double Indemnity\\" and especially of \\"Maltese Falcon\\" which happens to be together with \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" my favourite representatives of the genre although \\"Chinatown\\" more closely resembles the \\"Maltese Falcon\\".  Nicholson parallels Bogart here and Dunaway does Astor and ironically John Huston, the director of the \\"Maltese Falcon\\" has an acting role here.<br /><br />\\"Chinatown\\" does a great job in bringing the noir genre into the colour-age and does so very well by incorporating the best of the old black and white films into the more modern film making elements of the time.  This film has gone on to influence even more modern films like \\"The Black Dahlia\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and its theme of corrupt police and their evil rich backers who get away with anything with an excellent plot and great acting by Dunaway, Huston and Nicholson make this a great film to watch.<br /><br />The only problem is with the very poor picture quality which really should have been restored although they did a pretty good job with the sound quality which has been a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option.  The picture quality have a number of imperfections such as white spots and barely reaches VHS quality.  As Roman Polanski is still alive the last I checked, they really should try and do a Director's Cut version with restored and remastered picture and sound quality before it's too late.<br /><br />I'd recommend giving this dvd version of the movie a miss at least until they come up with a much better restored version preferably together with a Director's Cut either on standard or Blu-ray formats.<br /><br />Updated 30 May 2013:<br /><br />That's more like it!  Not only does this Bluray release come in a very neat looking Steelbook, the picture quality has improved substantially from the standard dvd version and while some grain is visible I'm personally fine with that.  The sound quality has also improved but not as much relative to the video; the soundtrack is still a lot louder than the spoken track and under the DolbyTrueHD 5.1 mode you have to struggle to hear some of the dialogue while the music blasts quite loudly at some points.  Otherwise this is a worthy upgrade and I've added 2 stars to my previous review of the standard dvd version above.<br /><br />Now recommended!t not as much relative to the video; the soundtrack is still a lot louder than the spoken track and under the DolbyTrueHD 5.1 mode you have to struggle to hear some of the dialogue while the music blasts quite loudly at some points.

The owners, husband and wife, are trying to do their best for their clients :))
B001EB5BDU|4.0|It took Mark Knopfler 4 albums to reach the height of his artistic abilities at least when it comes to creating a recording that can only be described as a masterpiece of aural art.  This is by far the best Dire Straits album ever with every track exhibiting a side of Knopfler's personality and compositional skill.  From the singular wit and sense of humour that we had a hint of from tracks like &#34;Les Boys&#34; to the funny lyric or two on &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; from [[ASIN:B00004Y6NX Making Movies]] we get my favourite tongue in cheek laugher &#34;Industrial Disease&#34; here.  Although this may not have been his best selling album but then again it should be no surprise that this is the case as it is frequently so that an artist's best ever work is not also his most commercially successful one, as an overall completely and consistently solid piece of art, make no mistake that &#34;Love Over Gold&#34; represents Knopfler at the top of his game and he's not come even close since.  [[ASIN:B000J23510 Brothers in Arms]] is his well-deserved commercial sell-out and his pension plan but is nowhere close to reaching the heights that this brilliant album does.  If you are looking at getting just one album from Dire Straits folks let this one be it.<br /><br />This album has also been remastered very well even though it has nothing to do with the SHM process more of which I will cover later.  The sound quality due to the remastering is first class making this the best sounding version of the album that I've ever heard.  This mlps (mini-lp replica sleeve) version though is a mixed bag. First the great news: this album has been very well remastered for an excellent sound and has a 16-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and rather bizarrely has a square cardboard insert of the original lp centre circle of both sides of the record indicating at the bottom right my &#34;copy no. 1496&#34; making me wonder who the lucky bloke is who has &#34;copy no. 1&#34;.  The inner jacket sleeve faithfully replicates the original lp with all the tiny lyrics on it.  The only beef I have with this and is why I only gave it 4 stars is the actual assembly of the mlps itself which is so disappointingly poor given the quality of the rest of the package. The cardboard is of thin poor quality and looks as if it will fall apart once the glue gets old.  For examples of very well assembled mlps designs go see the ones done for the entire Hall & Oates reissue as well as those done for Queen and The Band which are simply works of art which showed those concerned had great pride in their work. Too bad there are no bonus tracks here as it would have been nice to have the single &#34;Twisting By the Pool&#34; included.<br /><br />&#34;Telegraph Road&#34; is my favourite Knopfler tune and I believe it to be his best ever.  &#34;Private Investigations&#34; is another classic and has to be among the top 10 tunes he has ever written showcasing his completeness as a guitarist playing a very decent Spanish style guitar throughout.  &#34;Love Over Gold&#34; is such a beautiful track that it almost brings tears of joy to my eyes whenever I hear it.  Parts of it sound a lot like Tina Turner's hit single &#34;Private Dancer&#34; to me but I guess I shouldn't be surprised as that track was part written by Knopfler himself and you can't get mad at a guy for ripping himself off anyway.  Listening to this cd while I write this I am amazed at just how good the sound quality is and I have to applaud the job the remasters engineers did a few years back.  Too bad the mlps design couldn't do justice to the overall package though.<br /><br />A word about SHM-CD so that there's no more confusion seeing as how I've gotten a few of these cds I've discovered that the important thing to note is that SHM cds are NOT remastered.  They claim to have improved the plastic surface so that the laser reading the track info is better able to provide a clearer sound.  After regretfully finding out the hard way after listening to both my original cd versions and the SHM versions of Whitesnake's &#34;1987&#34; and Def Leppard's &#34;Hysteria&#34; and &#34;Adrenalise&#34; among a few others I've found out that unless the underlying tracks have been remastered well, the SHM process only accentuates and emphasises the limitations of the original master.  By making a better reflective surface, all SHM does is to make the imperfections sound worse unless again they have been well mastered to begin with.  That explains why this album sounds so good because the SHM treatment was done to the remastered version and why the Whitesnake and Def Leppard SHMs sound so terribly bad and even worse than my original cd versions which haven't been remastered before the SHM treatment was applied and so only succeeded in making the terrible imperfections on my original cd become much more obvious and ironically I had to pay a lot more money to get a worse sounding cd to my original ones.  Just a friendly warning so that you know what SHM is all about and why a truly well-done remaster is what you should look for and not just a better reflective surface which is what SHM represents.  For this reason, I have done deeper research in ensuring the SHM treatment is being done on previously well remastered cds before getting for example the Moody Blues and Alan Parsons Project albums that have been advertised as being given the SHM treatment.  I should be getting these soon and I'll be able then to tell you how they sound.  I'm avoiding like the plague any SHM cds advertised that I cannot first ascertain the source of the original master.  Now they are advertising a new &#34;Blu-cd&#34; which apparently uses a similar process to Sony's Blu-ray dvds and that holds some excitement for me as it may just make existing old cds sound better as it's an entire process and not just using better quality plastic reflective surfaces like SHM which cannot actually do anything to improve a poor master to begin with but instead ironically to make it sound a lot worse!<br /><br />In conclusion, this mlps version of an excellent album is a mixed bag because it costs a great deal and yet the cardboard sleeve is poorly designed and assembled but the excellent sound quality somewhat makes up for this. You decide if this is still a value proposition enough for you to part with the serious mullah this retails at.e hard way after listening to both my original cd versions and the SHM versions of Whitesnake's &#34;1987&#34; and Def Leppard's &#34;Hysteria&#34; and &#34;Adrenalise&#34; among a few others I've found out that unless the underlying tracks have been remastered well, the SHM process only accentuates and emphasises the limitations of the original master.

B00005JPS8|4.0|Iron Man  (2008) One of Marvel Comics' coolest, if not most famous superheroes finally gets brought to the big screen for the first time in this new flick from director Jon Favreau. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours. He is a hard drinking, womanizing, self centered vanity case, but his charm carries him, along with the piles of money he makes. While on a junket in Afghanistan to show off his newest missile, Stark's convoy is attacked and he is caught by a ruthless Afghani terrorist cabal. The attack left Stark with deadly shrapnel in his chest, threatening his heart, but a fellow scientist prisoner manages to cobble together a nasty looking but effective electromagnetic pacemaker and jam it into Stark's chest to hold the shrapnel at bay. The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one. He agrees to make the rocket, and makes a list of materials he'll need. When the baddies give him the goods however, he instead cobbles together a clunky but highly effective armored battlesuit he uses to wipe out most of the villains and escape. Back in America, Stark picks up his old life with Air Force pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), mentor Stane (Jeff Bridges), and especially Girl Friday Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). He does have to deal with wearing a glowing chest ornament the size of a small dinner plate, but no Marvel Comics hero's life is perfect, no matter how much money he has. Stark also takes the battlesuit design further, building a sleeker, faster version that turns him fully into the superhero Iron Man. Now, with all this high tech weaponry at his disposal, he has to find out who has sold him out by selling his weapons design to Afghani terrorists. And, unknown to Stark, that same someone is using the pieces of his first design to reverse engineer an even larger, more deadly battlesuit. Once again, jumping right into line with \\"Michael Keaton as Batman\\" I wasn't sure an Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr and directed by Jon Favreau would be what I wanted it to be. And once again I couldn't have been more wrong. Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up. Of course, it doesn't hurt that unlike Spider-Man, director Favreau can cut to close-ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene. The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year. (Crossover sequel anyone?) Kudos to director Favreau for balancing the action and lighter moments, and providing a lot of flash bang but not letting the movie coast on the effects. (He also takes a prime role for anyone familiar with Iron Man's comics backstory as chauffeur \\"Happy\\" Hogan, who doesn't get a lot of screen time here, but promises to show up more in the sequel and get some quality time with Paltrow!)

0142000671|4.0|The book, Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, is about the adventures of two best friends that are meant to take care of each other. Their names are George and Lennie. George always has to take care of himself as well as Lennie. Lennie is a challenged individual, but he is the sweetest man. He really means well. The way he talks and acts reflects that he is a little boy stuck in a strong mans body. Lennie is by far my favorite character in this book. Lennie has an obsession with touching soft things. At the beginning of the book it starts with Lennie having a mouse in his pocket which he accidentally kills because he strokes the mouse to hard. He felt horrible. George, who is always taking care of Lennie, is more of a dad to Lennie than a friend. He was asked by Lennie's Aunt Clara to look after Lennie when she died. Throughout the story George continues to look after Lennie wherever they go.   Both George and Lennie have a life goal of having a place of their own with land, a house, and animals. They have a place that they can buy from an older couple, but they need to get six-hundred and fifty dollars to buy it from them. They are working to get this money so they can run off and escape from the working world and \\"live offa the fatta the lan' (Steinbeck 56).\\" Throughout the book they travel to find a place to work so they can get the amount of money that they need in order to buy that piece of land. They find a farm that will take both of them as workers and that is where the majority of the story takes place. Most of the people that are working at the farm really like George and Lennie, except for the farm owners's son, Curly. Eventually Lennie and Curly get into a fight. Lennie accidentally crushes Curly's hand. Another incident between Lennie and Curly occurs toward the end of the book that angers Curly to the point that he is ready to kill Lennie.   I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. One because it was easy to follow and always kept me wondering whatwas going to happen next. I could not put the book down. I sat down and read the entire book all at once. Another reason is because it was one of those books that are short enough that you can sit down and read the whole story in a few hours. The book also had an interesting story plot. There was one part of this book that I did not like. I was disappointed when Steinbeck made Lennie look like a bad guy for part of the story. An example is when Lennie kills the mouse at the beginning of the book. Lennie has good and honest intentions. I felt so bad for him that I almost started to cry. Lennie felt horrible every time he did something to hurt someone or something in the book because he did not understand his own strength. I really like how George is a father figure to Lennie and how Lennie really appreciates George. Lennie understands that George will always there for him. The two men give each other a reason to live. George and Lennie truly value each other's friendship. I recommend this book for all boys and girls, child or adult.

B000000IRL|5.0|Credit Hodgson & Davies for writing such wonderful songs, such as the hits \\"The Logical Song,\\" \\"Goodbye Stranger,\\" and \\"Take The Long Way Home.\\" But even the non-hits are shimmering beauties, such as \\"Gone Hollywood,\\" \\"Oh Darling\\" (not to be confused with the Beatles tune), \\"Lord Is It Mine,\\" and the exuberant finale, \\"Child Of Vision,\\" all played to perfection by Hodgson, Davies (who both do great vocal work as well), sax player John Halliwell, bassist Dougie Thomson, and drummer Bob Siebenberg. This new remastered edition of \\"Breakfast In America\\" sounds sensational, with greater boom & clarity than any CD version of \\"Breakfast\\" that I'd ever heard before (including the now-defunct gold disc version from Mobile Fidelity). Now you can enjoy Supertramp's all-time classic the way it was meant to be heard. Pick it up, and enjoy this delicious breakfast as only Supertramp can serve it.
B00008G9JM|5.0|This album is sometimes dark, sometimes sad, sometimes joyful, sometimes sinister, snarling, tongue-in-cheek, and whatever else. It's a really different and refreshing sound, creative, theatrical, just overall wonderful. I'm glad to see this album is popular with so many people because it certainly is a gem that never got it's due.     It's a fantastic album to sit down and listen to whether it be on a stereo or on your headphones (both work great), but it isn't exactly background music for a social gathering.     If you haven't heard this album before, I don't think anyone could describe this close enough for you to expect what you actually hear. Or hear what you actually expect? Who knows.
B0000AFX64|5.0|They made three versions of this. They made a 3-hour television version (Included with the series), a 3-part television version, and a 2-hour theatrical version. This is the theatrical version. The main difference is that in this version Baltar is killed. In the TV versions he lives. Also some scenes have been edited out of this version in order to make it shorter. But there is one scene that is included in this version that's not included in the TV versions for fear of being too violent. Apart from Baltar's death, this version includes a man catching on fire aboard the battlestar Atlantia during the cylon attack. These days it seems stupid to think of that being too violent, but back then the sensors were more strict. Another thing, the DVD release is in widescreen. At least that's what they want you to believe. It was originally shot in full screen for TV. They just cut out the top and bottom of the screen to make it appear in widescreen. So really you're getting less of the picture instead of more. Those bastards! The movie itself is great. The plot is amazing. Twelve colonies of man in a distant galaxy are wiped out by an evil robot race called Cylons. The last surviving warship, the Galactica, leads a handful of survivors to their long-lost sister colony planet, Earth. But getting there will not be easy. They still have to deal with the Cylons as well as sinister bug-eyed creatures that they encounter on the first planet they stop at. Action-packed, great acting, and directing. There's not one bad thing in this movie.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!protect the fleet from the Cylon baseships, the Galactica must enter the void which leads them to their long-lost homeworld, the planet Kobol. Kobol is now a dead world, but the remains of the ancient city of the once great civilization that lived there could show the way to Earth. But will their expedition to the planet be interrupted by a visit from the Cylons and the traitor Baltar? Five stars.    Review for \\"Battlestar Galactica: Fire in Space\\" on VHS    The Galactica is attacked by Cylon suicide raiders which critically wounds Adama and causes an uncontrollable fire to spread through the ship, threatening to destroy the Galactica itself. Boomer must lead a handful of survivors, Athena and Boxey included, away from a fiery death, and he will get a helping hand from Boxey's robotic dog Muffit. Five stars.

B001AGXEA6|4.0|Beetlejuice [[ASIN:B001AGXEA6 Beetlejuice [Blu-ray]]] is a timeless classic with Michael Keaton providing an excellent performance.  The afterlife concept of the film is excellent as well as entertaining; this film is a must for your video library... It's to be watched over and over again.    The casting for this film is perfect, Michael Keaton is the outrageously funny and whacky witted (Betelguese - the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist) with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis playing (Adam and Barbara Maitland), a young couple that die prematurely. Adding to the cast are Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara (as Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter Winona Ryder (as Lydia).      One of the most hilarious scenes is the dinner party accompanied by Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat song `Day-O'.   This is truly Tim Burton at his finest taking the significance of being dead and dousing it with humor.
055357342X|5.0|This is another great book from Martin.  If you liked A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, you'll certainly want to read this next, and you won't be able to put it down.  One word of warning for people who haven't yet started the series though:  There are only 4 books out right now, with another 1-3 expected to complete the story, and these books are not exactly coming quickly.  If you're someone who wouldn't want to read part of a story and then pause for several years, you might want to wait to pick these up.  Certainly I want Martin to take the time he needs to do it right, but from another perspective, you're basically buying part of a product here, with no finished product available.
1416595546|5.0|A great read, although the author seems to presuppose that the reader will have more than a passing knowledge of 20th century Russian history.  The story skips between 1916, just prior to the Revolution, until 1939 toward the end of Stalin's purges, and then to 1994 in the modern post-Soviet era. The problem is that a reader really needs to be knowledgeable about the historical events that occurred during the intervening years to really understand how those events impacted the lives of the characters during the periods skipped over by the narrative.     For example, mention is made at some point of the civil war between the Red forces and the White forces.  How many American readers are aware that such a civil war ever took place?  Although the historical character of Trotsky is mentioned on several occasions, how many of today's modern readers will even know of him or why his supposed supporters were being hunted down by Stalin?  I am not suggesting that the author needed to \\"dumb down\\" his narrative but am merely pointing out that the book might be somewhat confusing to the average reader.  Nevertheless, anyone who does have an interest in the history of the periods in question will find the story a fascinating one.  With regard to the story itself, my only criticism is the unexpected appearance toward the end of the book of one of the characters thought to have perished in the purges.  Although he played a major unintended role in causing the death of the title character, there seemed to have been no real reason for him to have been resurrected by the author.    I do believe that anyone who has ever visited St. Petersburg or Moscow will enjoy reading the book because  many of the events detailed therein take place near sites that are commonly visited by tourists.  Although we rarely see a mini-series on television any more, this book would make an ideal one, although I would envision the story being told not in chronological order, but as a series of flashbacks with the story being told by the characters still alive in 1994.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|In a recent ranking from the London Times, the inaugural effort from Fleet Foxes was voted the best record of 2008. Ordinarily this kind of \\"official\\" recognition usually invites the blowback from every corner of the music world who in dissing the newcomers offer countless more deserving alternatives that are normally a homage to personal taste and the coolness of obscurity than an objective look (if that's even possible) at the entire range of worthwhile (and not so worthwhile) nominees. In this regard, reader comments to the article did not disappoint.    Please forgive me if I sidestep that no-win conversation and just go from the gut - Fleet Foxes is a really strong and inspired first effort. The \\"best\\" of 2008? Not quite. However, if you're a fan of Britain's golden age of Progressive Rock - Renaissance, The Moody Blues, Genesis, Yes, ELP, Tull, 10cc, and Blondel - and enjoy healthy overtones of Neil Young, The Eagles and some very tight harmonies ala Lindsey Buckingham, then Fleet Foxes channels them all with precision and great result.    Honestly, there are too many doppelgangers and other influences at work here to consider this release the best of the year but it is hard to argue the records merit when the \\"borrowing\\" is from such a rich vein of source material and is executed so well. In the meantime, I am looking forward to hearing more from a very promising band as they discover their own sound.

B001DPHDCY|4.0|I truly didn't expect this movie to be so great. I bought it simply for the kids, but it's a funny and almost educational film. It has not-so-subtle religious themes which give parent a chance to talk about various topics of religion, like if God exists, faith, forgiveness, etc. We've watched this at least a half-dozen times already in three days and it's still good. It's one of those kid films you can listen to as parents and not really get annoyed with. Great movie...much better than I expected. I gave it 4 stars because there's a scene that involves the genitals (typical \\"guy gets hit in the you-know-whats\\") that I think could have been left out.
0887307280|1.0|As others have said, this book is just one long commercial for Gerber's own business... and it worked, apparently. The capstone class for my major included this book as one of the required texts; the entire semester was spent listening to Gerber blow his own horn with Sarah the pie baker at her side... at least, that's what I heard. After listening to a few hours worth of this fraud (dare I say con-man?) and his obnoxious, annoying way of speaking about his even more annoying (generic, bland, unfounded) \\"insights\\" into a world of business that has no basis in the real world, I stayed home and got stoned instead... and I still got an A in the class, because when it came to the tests on this guy and his ideas, all I had to do was pick the most self-absorbed, pompous, condescending, Narcissistic answers and they were invariably the \\"right ones\\" according to my professor, who bought into all this B.S.    Whew, that was a run-on sentence... much like Gerber's. If you're unfortunate enough to have to listen to the audio version of the book or any of this guy speeches, he can speak for 5 minutes without pausing to breath, or even think.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I really think this is one of best Jane Austen adaptations ever.  I was sorry to hear that it is cut from the original.  Unfortunately, none of them ever compares to the books because the books are, of course, masterpieces depicting the truest truths of human behavior. I highly recommend listening to unabridged audio versions that give them life but don't take away from the beautiful language.
B000S6LT42|4.0|This is a lot of fun for fans of the Rolling Stones and of Rock and Roll! Live Stones plus those extras that one might expect would come with a 4 CD set. Normally, I don't look too much at extras, but there are some interesting items that come with the concert footage itself, especially on Disk 4.<br /><br />The one real downer to this is the first disc of the set.  Whoever I bought it from sent me a dud.  There were a lot of flaws in the recording--especially skips and breaks in the track. Indeed, as the concert finished, my computer shut down saying it had encountered a major problem. This has nothing to do with the music, but I wish I could recall who sold it to me. . . .<br /><br />Enough. On to the concert footage. Concerts in Rio and Austin, Texas give us a detailed look at a Stones' concert. And the playing is hot.  Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards play the guitars well--belying their ages. Darryl Jones (technically on contract, but he might as well be called a band member) and Charlie Watts anchor the band with their rhythm work. Mick Jagger sings well, although without the vocal range of his youth. It's amazing how lively the four Stones can still perform.<br /><br />Disk One. The concert starts with \\"You Got Me Rocking.\\" Wood and Richards begin with some nice guitar playing and the solid rhythm section provides great backing. Nice start to the concert! Some other tracks that caught my interest: The Temptations' \\"Ain't too Proud to Beg\\" has been covered by the Stones before.  Here, they provide us with a credible version.  Back to the mid-19670s with \\"Get off of My Cloud.\\" Great lyrics and a hard rocker still performed well. Jagger dances well and Richards cranks out gritty guitar work. \\"Honky Tank Women\\" is as raunchy as ever, with fine guitar work. \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\": The opening notes begin to foreshadow the dark lyrics, with the \\"ooh-oohs.\\" Another well performed song.  \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" provides one of the best guitar riffs in rock and roll and some of the finest 3 minutes of music. Guitar work is great and Watts' drumming is stellar in this song. \\"Satisfaction\\" begins with the fuzz tone and the band still plays it with conviction, even though it is (I can scarcely believe this) a song that is over 40 years old! Final encore--\\"Brown Sugar.\\" The lyrics regarding slavery give this song some gravitas to my mind. The rhythm section sparkles; Bobby Keyes does a great job, too. Fine fireworks display to close this concert out.<br /><br />Disk Two.  The concert from Rio is spectacular.  The sea of people attending this concert is powerful! Many of the songs are the same as Disk One.  A couple comments about songs NOT appearing at the Austin concert.  \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is played especially well.  \\"Everybody got to go.\\" Closer to the version on \\"Get Your Ya-Yas Out\\" than the concert I saw in 1975. The guitar playing in the middle is a chance for Richards and Wood to throw out nasty notes from their guitars Harmonica work by Jagger is fine, too. \\"It's only Rock and Roll\\" shows a band enjoying itself. Man, here and on other songs you can see a lot of wrinkles on the faces of Wood, Watts, Richards, and Jagger.  But they play a lot younger than they look. \\"Start Me Up,\\" \\"Miss You\\". . . .  More fine concert footage.<br /><br />Anyhow, despite the problem with the first disk, the music itself is fine.  I've listened to a lot of Rolling Stones' live music and this is one of their best concert works. Maybe not as spirited and electric as \\"Ya-Yas,\\" but awfully good! If you desire a lot of music and some cool extras, you might try this out.utes of music.

More fine concert footage.    Anyhow, despite the problem with the first disk, the music itself is fine.  I've listened to a lot of Rolling Stones' live music and this is one of their best concert works. Maybe not as spirited and electric as \\"Ya-Yas,\\" but awfully good! If you desire a lot of music and some cool extras, you might try this out.
0440241030|2.0|I started \\"The Hard Way\\" with hopes that the book would usher me into a new series I'd like. The book starts out well, but soon falters. There are numerous problems with the book, mostly pertaining to the author's apparent limitations.<br /><br />First, everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, speaks in the same manner. It doesn't matter if they're young, old, male, female, American, British, military, or civilian, they all speak in the same way, with the same tired cliche vocabularies, staccato sentence fragments, and machismo. It really becomes annoying.<br /><br />Second, the \\"mystery\\" is pretty obvious. I had it figured out about 1/4 of the way into the book -- not the plot, but the basic outline of who was doing what.<br /><br />Third, the obsessive attention to detail really gets boring. Does every facet on the cut-glass chandelier in the high-ceilinged, oak-paneled, maroon-carpeted lobby that smells of cigars and cosmetic counters as the filtered sunlight fades through the glass doorways, one revolving bracketed by a standard push door on either side -- does all this need to be described every time something appears? I found myself quickly searching for dialog so I could stop reading about every crack in the sidewalk.<br /><br />Finally, the finale is just a little silly. The amazing deception Reacher enacts at the end has plenty of holes in it, and these are apparent as you read it (as if they wouldn't hear a 6'3\\" 250# guy running full-speed when their senses are piqued and they're under attack).<br /><br />All in all, a disappointment. Starts out great, soon falters, and then drifts into a monotony of dialog and detail and weak plotting. Too bad.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|The story was slow and I didn't get overly attached to the characters. If I had seen the movie before I purchased it, I wouldn't have purchased it.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|One could call it a period film, perhaps a gothic romance, and old-fashioned, and all these would be compliments for The Illusionist, which gives the idea of \\"great film storytelling\\" meaning. Director Neil Burger makes The Illusionist more than just a story though, taking on an artistic quality that transcends typical filmmaking. Brilliant atmosphere, authentic characters, a great script, beautiful scenery, and a wonderful music score make this one a gem.<br /><br />One of the film's interesting aspects is just the allegorical quality that emerges. It's much more than a thriller, mystery, or period film about love and magic. Eisenheim's crushed hopes of love in childhood are given a second chance, and this plays into the theme of rekindling lost love, giving the film a parable-like quality.  Illusion-- the subject of what is real and what is not--is a central idea in not only the story's premise, but the film's d&eacute;nouement at the finish. For this reason, you can't take everything at \\"face value\\" - supernatural and mystery play a major role in the building of Eisenheim as a character.<br /><br />The characterization and script are superb, and this really keeps the plot's flow at a steady pace. Edward Norton brings the character of Eisenheim to life, giving a mysterious yet charismatic aspect to the role. He makes this idea of creating illusion an art form on the big screen, as he dazzles many in the audience with his shows. It is later on in life when, while doing a show, he meets up with childhood friend and sweetheart Sophie, who is now engaged to the Crown Prince, a villainous man who reportedly abuses his lovers. This meeting sets into motion the conflict between Eisenheim and the Crown Prince, archrivals for Sophie's love. Another important role is that of the Inspector, who is both suspicious and in awe of Eisenheim's illusionary feats, but must ultimately answer to the Crown Prince. While the Crown Prince wants Eisenheim shut down for blasphemy and heresy, the Inspector has no real proof to charge him with.<br /><br />Mythical elements, a great music score, and clever imagination make this feel like we are transported to Vienna circa 1900 to watch the story unfold. There is magic and illusion, and the suspense builds after Eisenheim's shows take on a much darker feel, in which he can reach into the \\"other world\\" to find out information about lost loved ones.<br /><br />Over all, there is a great job of filmmaking and storytelling here. There is definitely an art-like quality to The Illusionist, and there is more than meets the eye!s no real proof to charge him with.     Mythical elements, a great music score, and clever imagination make this feel like we are transported to Vienna circa 1900 to watch the story unfold.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wall-E is an AMAZING piece of art. Pixar has gone and outdone themselves with this one. From the amazing sound design by the guy that brought you R2D2 from Star Wars to the heart warming storyline about a little robot that won over everyone's heart just because he had the will to be good. This movie is perfect for a 2 year old to a 50 year old. Wall-E is an instant Disney classic. Thank you Pixar. Thank you.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Upon realeasing Mer De Noms, A Perfect Circle showed that they was nothing short of a supergroup, delivering Metal in a way that only they could. With songs like \\"3 Libras\\", we saw a side of Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan that we'd never thought existed. A great kick off to his and Billy Howerdel's partnership.    But once Paz Lenchantin and Troy Van Leeuwen left the group for different projects, the help of fellow metalists James Iha and Jeordie White (AKA Twiggy Ramirez, if that rings a bell) was enlisted, but who would expect what was coming next for A Perfect Circle?    Then came Thirteenth Step. What a blow.    Thirteenth Step is an incredibly melodic album that hooks you in from beginning (The Package, Weak and Powerless) to end (Gravity) and just leaves you with that \\"wow\\" feeling that makes any music lover shiver. Maynard's singing takes a turn for the softer stuff in this album, and Josh Freese's awe-spiring drumming is definitely not getting any worse.    So what's the report on the newbies? First off, James Iha belongs with A Perfect Circle. It's just that simple. His technique combined with Billy's ideas just reach their peak once \\"Weak And Powerless\\" fires up, and just sucks you in, making you want to listen to the guitar on there over and over again. Next off, it's a big difference seeing Jeordie White not looking like a killer and actually smiling for a change, at the same time revealing on Thirteenth Step that he is one heck of a bassist.    For anyone who bothers to read this till the end (let's face it, our attention span gets shorter every day), I highly recommend Thirteenth Step, which at the same time stays true to APC's roots all while making beautifully sounding tracks that stay stuck in your head just as much as \\"I'm Too Sexy\\". Peace.
B000YABYLA|4.0|There are many things I liked about this picture-<br /><br />The acting was first rate across the board.<br /><br />The cinematography was good, capturing the slight claustrophobic overtone of the town and social circles within which the characters moved.<br /><br />Especially good, remarkable really, was the imperfect nature of life and family that it captured, showing, that in the totality of things, half a loaf is about all you are going to get.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me was the emotional ease with which Juno gave up her child almost as if it were an unwanted puppy, a soluble but tricky problem to be finessed and without any lingering baggage.<br /><br />It really made the her character seem incredibly shallow within a context of uber superficiality that she was suppose to juxtapose.
B000ASEWEC|5.0|This review is for the Heritage Press 1941 edition of Treasure Island, illustrated by E.A. Wilson.     One of the most enduring and popular releases from the Heritage Press, this one went through several reprints - reprints that apparently resulted in design changes to the slipcase. This review is based on the 1941 edition in the 1969 release.     A solid and surprisingly hefty book, printed on creamy eggshell stock with ample margins. The design is meant to evoke books of the late 18th century with the quarter-cloth faux Morocco binding with maroon and gold details. Amply illustrated with pictorial boards depicting a map of the island and another color map on the front and back pastedowns. Wilson creates well over 50 drawings for this edition, all of them in full color or pen and ink with a single color wash: full page portraits of key characters, full page headings for each Part of the book, and many smaller incidental illustrations.     273 pages, in a sand-colored matte slipcase, with the introduction by the author.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's books continue to take a subject based in \\"common wisdom\\" and flip it over to find the surprises dwelling underneath. He did that in the \\"Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\" and he again does it here.    I heard him interviewed on NPR just as this book was just coming out, and I wondered if he had gone beyond the limit of political correctness by looking at cultural issues,language, race, religion and class.  So I bought the book somewhat reluctantly.  What I found to my delight was a well researched and well reasoned look at the causes of high performance that do have a basis in these \\"PC\\" taboo subjects.    To me there is nothing depressing in understanding that many high performers have gotten to be where they are on the basis of being exactly in the right place at the right time with the right generative culture milieu. That's enlightening.  Yes, we probably all can't be Bill Gates no matter how hard we work.  And we don't choose our parents, our birth date or birth order, or our culture.  But our circumstances don't mean that we shouldn't develop our skills to the highest levels and work beyond the expected limits with what we have been given.   Perhaps you are the next \\"outlier\\" and don't even know it.    I always look forward to Gladwell's books for their fresh point of view.    I recommend this one.

B000I2IT44|5.0|I First got turned on to this band when watching a documentary DVD on the band Opeth which Porcupines Tree's singer/guitarist mastermind (Steven Wilson) was the Producer of their albums (Damnation, Deliverance, and Blackwater Park, all must have CD's in their own right).  I picked up a couple CD's of theirs on Ebay, and I was hooked. I've since bought everything they have put out and there is not a bad disk in the lot. Start with In Absentia and Deadwing, they are  probably the two best.    Back to this DVD. It was filmed in Chicago, and it has a very good selection of their best stuff. Sound is excellent, Video Editing is good, not to much jumping around that gives you a headache, like on alot of other DVD's I've seen. Just go buy this, you won't regret it.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I got this to go along with a Nikon D40 that I bought for my wife. It's difficult to see from the product pictures, but the flash head tilts so that you can bounce the flash off the ceiling to create much warmer images. It has a very quick recovery time and isn't a battery hog (however I would recommend using rechargeable batteries).
B00005JKG9|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  When you see Pacino, Harris, Spacey, Lemmon, Baldwin all in one movie, you have to think it would be a great movie.

B001GKJ2DO|1.0|but I was wrong. When I visited the old Iron Curtain Russia some years ago, I met a young Russian.  He asked me to mail him some music from the West. His choice form all the glittering tunes  available and forbidden to him was ABBA, so I hold their songs in some reverence.  And that music certainly deserves a better venue than this piece of trash. Everyone except the young  bride to be looks uncomfortable and no wonder--everyone is horribly miscast, and most can't  sing any better than Gabby Hayes or Andy Devine. I thought Pierce Brosnan merely stank up James  Bond movies, but it's nice to know that he's not tightly type cast and can stink up musicals as  well. Ms Streep similarly is woeful in this role. I do respect her earlier films so I know she can act, but  she left those abilities there with the hat-check girl when she entered the movie lot.  I can't for the life of me understand all the positive reviews of this film. Have musicals reached such  a deplorable state not no one remembers what a good one is like? Go watch West Side Story  or Camelot and leave this mess to someone unsophistocated enough to shell out for it. And in the future  please, Hollywood, stay far away from the individual who selected these \\"actors\\"
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This movie is without a doubt, the best western ever made, in fact, it maybe the best movie ever made.  The acting, characters, screen shots, scenery, are outstanding.  This movie is Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones' masterpieces of their excellent careers.  I have watched this movie numerous times and I walk away from it shaking my head in awe.  Anyone who watches this movie will get a very good idea what the old west was like, no holes barred.   Lonesome Dove is a classic movie and an excellent bargain for the price.
0393061310|5.0|Professor Diamond takes up a very difficult question that spans centuries. He sets out to figure out why the Europeans were able to succeed not only in their enviornment, but control throughout the world.     Geography is something Diamond finds as a major factor. Geographic luck was able to determine that type of crops, and the conditions.     Diamond concludes that once the societies discovered how to produce enough food for themselves, then some of the other citizens were able to use their free time to advance other areas. This created specialists which resulted in the innovations of Guns and Steel. The germ advantage was because the Europeans lived with pigs.     Domestic animals (Diamond finds 14 thorughout history) most of them centered in Europe gave the major advantage against disease.     Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is an outstanding and interesting book to read.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Excellant 1950's epic, loved the sets and actors were great.  A classic worth collecting as computer generated movies today just don't match the REAL casts of hundreds in a scene and the lavish costumes and sets used in these grand displays portrayed. Love the movie and hope others will enjoy who have never seen it.

0141185104|1.0|This book is one of the worst pieces of garbage i've ever had to read in my life. Of course this was a high school book and in high school evidently they feel every book we read either has to deal with a political issue or some sort of horrid death. and of course, this book is no exception. long and short, retarded guy and his not retarded friend are wandering around while he wants him to tell him about the rabbit farm they'll eventually have. then they meet up with a guy's farm, he accidentally kills a slut and...his best friend shoots him in the back of the head. yep. that's about all you need to know. there i just told you the whole story. so if you have to read it for school, just sparknote it. i know people out there will say \\"no, this is an american classic!\\" but let me ask you, WHY is it an 'American classic'? Because it hits political buttons. all these would be classics have something to do with political buttons. books such as to kill a mockingbird, lord of the flies, 1984, all these novels involve horrid deaths for little reason more than to consider them 'classics'. and because five pretentious critics gave these books great reviews back in the 50's, we're now forced to read them even today. For the actual book, it has one of the stupidest endings i've ever read in a novel, the characters are uninteresting, and this should not even be at a garage sale for a quarter, let alone an 'american classic'. of mice and men gets 1 dead friend out of 5

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I have love-hate feelings about cgi.<br /><br />I love the fact that this fantastic computer process allows filmmakers to create new worlds and tell epic stories that were previously difficult, if not impossible, to present on motion picture and television screens.<br /><br />On the other hand, I hate the fact that directors and cgi artists tend to overdo these effects in their movies, often to the detriment of good storytelling.<br /><br />This recent release from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  The movie is enhanced with a good basic story, likable performances and many sensational scenes that make for an overall enjoyable viewing experience.  Yet, this film could have been much more than it is had the filmmakers restrained themselves by not throwing everything but the proverbial kitchen sink into their action sequences.<br /><br />For example, the picture contains a car chase through densely populated city streets.  The sequence is well-staged and quite exciting, except that it seems to go on forever with one cgi generated stunt after another.<br /><br />Memo to Filmmakers: Enough already!  Less is More.<br /><br />WANTED is adapted from a series of comic books and tells of a shy junior accountant (James McAvoy), recruited into the Fraternity, an ancient secret society of assassins dedicated to killing people who will put the world into chaos.  McAvoy's long lost father was killed while working for the group, and now James has been selected to destroy the rogue member of the Fraternity who murdered him.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays the mysterious leader of the Fraternity, who has his own secrets, and Angelina Jolie is McAvoy's trainer and partner.<br /><br />Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, WANTED is filled with sensational cgi stunts, many of which strain believability.<br /><br />© Michael B.

I loved it within the first twenty pages, and the feeling remained throughout the book.  I cried, with tears pouring down my face; I laughed; I gasped.  Please read this book.  If not for the great read, then for the history and the respect you will gain for the rights of women.
0545128285|5.0|Not only was Rowling a genius in writing the Harry Potter books, but she then writes books that were imagined in those very same novels. Fantastic beasts and the rules of Quidditch she writes as separate books; now we have Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairytales for little wizards and witches so us Muggles can get a glimpse into this universe.<br /><br />I noted a great similarity between the \\"ancient\\" fairytales and our Snow White, Red Riding Hood and Grimms' Fairytales. They were written as a disguise of political criticism in a dark, medieval (SP) age. In the Wizard world, they were also persecuted -- but they communicated their dismay not only to make a point of that persecution but also how one may fall prey to Dark magic.<br /><br />The last tale of the three brothers made the last Potter novel make more sense to me and tied up a few loose ends I didn't know I had.<br /><br />Rowling said she would not write another Potter book but I'm glad she has not totally put her pen down just yet.<br /><br />And Rowling's charity benefits from these purchases.<br /><br />Bedtime stories for kids -- oh and read a few Silver age comics to them, too (but I digress....).<br /><br />Other suggestions:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1571745424 Muggles and Magic: An Unofficial Guide to J.k.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Adapted from the hit Broadway play,  MAMMA MIA! is a captivating movie musical that makes you want to sing right along with the Benny Andersson/Bjorn Ulvaeus music and lyrics, based on the songs of Abba.<br /><br />In fact, one of the special features on the DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a Sing-Along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers.<br /><br />Meryl Streep stars as the independently-minded owner of a broken down hotel on a remote island in Greece.  Her about-to-be wed daughter (Amanda Seyfried) does not know the identity of her father, since Mom was being romanced by three guys around the time she was conceived, so the young lady invites all three fellows to her wedding, signing Meryl's name to the invitation.  None of them have any idea that they might be the bride's father.<br /><br />When Meryl sees the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) she just wants them to go away, but Amanda is not about to let that happen in this very fun, joyous musical comedy.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, MAMMA MIA! has some terrific musical numbers, performed by Streep, Seyfried and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, who play Meryl's lifelong girl friends.  Ms. Baranski is particularly delightful.<br /><br />The men are not really singers, but they try hard and, truthfully, none of their songs require a strong voice.<br /><br />Director Lloyd supplies audio commentary and there is also a deleted musical number.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B00004XPPB|5.0|Didn't expect Al Pacino and Johnny Depp to be in the SAME FILM. But that's not what makes this a great film. This is brilliant because of the story, the tension, the characters, and the setting that they're all in. Johnny Depp is one-of-a-kind as the FBI agent Joseph Pstione, who disguises himself as Donnie Brasco. His job is to give the Bureau information on a mob organization, which includes the aging hitman Left Ruggiero. The situation gets out of hand as Pistone/Brasco starts to adapt a bit too well in the mafia environment. This leads to a confrontation with his job and his own family.<br /><br />Pacino, Depp, and Madsen give wonderful performances. Heche, Kirby, and Russo make a stunning supporting cast. Lots of tension and lots of drama and humor. I'd recommended it fully.<br /><br />Grade: A

All the on location filming from a real castle in France and other sites in the U.K. are amazing . This is a must see series to watch. I have read that it is supposed to be broadcast here in the US soon maybe and will be released on DVD but not known if it will be in Region 1 for US.. If you can find it on the internet and download all the episodes and watch as you are drawn into the story wanting to watch again and again to find out what Meriln's destiny is.....and best of all when you download them ..No Commercials !!

You'll probably be surprised  - it's a very helpful guide to helping you realize what you're good at and how you know you're good at it.  It's also very empowering - everyone is good at some things.  And everyone is not good at some things - and this book says you shouldn't worry so much about those things that you're not good at.  What an amazing concept!

B001GZ6QDS|2.0|Incredible movie! Cant say more! But I can say that everyone should save their money and buy the single disc version because the extras are so few and far between that it is simply not worth it. No deleted scenes, 2 rediculously short featurettes, some still galleries, and some imax scenes that r not worth the extra money.    No interviews with any of the stars of the movie, no nothing!LOL    They will probably do another release with more extras in the future, hold off until then.  And I am particularly irritated with the movie companies pushing blu ray through our throats as the new format to go to. I'm good with dvd, so give us the same extras that blu ray recieves!!!
B000001GJU|3.0|It's a good solid performance of both the New World symphony and the Moldau, my criticism is with the recording itself.  The opening of the first movement is so quiet that in order to hear it you have to crank the volume.  Then of course it gets very loud, very fast -- nearly blowing out the speakers.  I got it for the Moldau.  (Honestly, if I had remembered this problem, I would have got a different recording altogether.)
B000GIXEIG|3.0|If you're into swords-and-sandals epics, then Beowulf & Grendel probably appeals to you as at least a consideration. It's a modestly budgeted epic--more [[ASIN:6305692688 The 13th Warrior]] than the huge blockbuster-sized [[ASIN:B001AII4RM Beowulf [Blu-ray]]] we got from Hollywood this year. And sometimes there is something to a lesser effort that makes seeing it that much *more* rewarding.    Let's pause a moment and mention Iceland. This film was shot in Iceland and every single frame is bursting with absolutely glorious scenery. The Icelandic Tourist Board is writhing on the floor like so many of Hrothgar's drunken Danes with glee over this film.    Alas, they are probably the only folks. The initially promising moments in the film are good, as we see the troll's dad being pursued by Danes and battling with them (but not much battling). But from there things begin to fall apart. A lot of sword wielding guys in bad long hair, then it's time to stare at the beautiful Icelandic scenery, then let's all go to sleep and get killed in a gloriously uncinematic fashion.    Also due for a mauling: the original Beowulf story and character. Beowulf comes off as full of himself and not at all the hero (he doesn't wrestle Grendel--he's running away from him; he's mostly a passive observer). And the key role of Selma the witch is played by Sarah Polley with a broad American accent that utterly destroys the film. I mean annihilates it. It is so wrong.    Butler and Stellan Skarsgård do a good job with their roles, but there's no real saving this thing. If you must own it, play it as a silent film and watch Iceland. But I'm still waiting for someone to do John Gardner's [[ASIN:0679723110 Grendel]] or even the original epic the way it deserves.

I don't think anyone would be totally disappointed.

1878424602|4.0|You have a pretty good chance of reading an excellent book if it is written by Deepak Chopra.  He is one of those people that actualy make me feel more calm and serene just by listening to his words of wisdom and unlike some others, I believe he actually practices what he talks about.<br /><br />The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a tiny book that packs alot of wisdom.  Chopra has tackled a subject that is close to many of us - success - but rather its more than just success at work (i.e. promotions, etc.) it is about feeling successful within yourself - and in order to get there you have to find and discover your spiritual side.  This is much easier said than done - we, as human beings, do not naturally tend to favor our spiritual side.<br /><br />However, this book manages to meld the spiritual side and the success of having a happy, serene life.<br /><br />Each of the Spiritual Laws is clearly outlined and I particularly love the one about giving and receiving and equating it to love.  Actually, Chopra associates all of his spiritual laws with love and its wonderful.<br /><br />This book is a quick read, but is full of interesting, challenging and absolutely riveting truths.
0316010669|3.0|As the 976th reviewer of this book, there is not much new to add here.  I will say it was an enjoyable read. My perception was that I really didn't know what Gladwell was attempting to say.  Is \\"thinking without thinking\\" good or bad?  More to the point, he presents information that supports both sides of the argument but no conclusions.  Use it, don't use it, useful characteristic not useful?  Answer: sometimes, but when is not evident.  Additionally, Gladwell throws a lot of white noise into the mix.  Things that don't seem to have relevance to what he is presenting.  For example, how too much information can sometimes interfere with decision making or how stressful situations make you \\"mind blind\\".  Though the anecdotes were interesting, neither is about \\"thinking without thinking\\".  Gladwell implies that \\"thinking without thinking\\" has characteristics of being instinctual, then says instincts can be cultivated through experiences, then provides information that instincts are frequently wrong, then provides examples of how critical thinking can be wrong; so I am left with the same question?  What was the intent of the book?  I don't necessarily need a roadmap, but it would have been nice to know the destination.
0790737345|2.0|when I placed an order for this movie it was rated PG-13, when I got the order, it was rated R, I was very dissapointed as we try not to watch rated R movies in our home, yet I love this particular one.
0553208845|5.0|I read this book at least once a year, and every year, I find unexpected ways to grow and understand the world. It's an exquisite, essential read.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight arrived with tremendous hype and incredibly, it lived up to all of it. Fitted with a pitch-perfect cast (Heath Ledger is phenomenal as the joker), outstanding writing, and a compelling vision is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real. The only small complaint is that Rachel Dawes is played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and not Katie Holmes who was in the original but Gyllenhaal still does a great job here. The 2 disc layout is great with great special features including interviews and \\"making of\\" the movie.<br /><br />The cast returns from Batman Begins creating an astonishing feel for the story. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman (Christian Bale) and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) all fufiling their roles. But the true star is Ledger who is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices. Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan follows his critically acclaimed Batman Begins with an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies because of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism. A fantastic film for the ages and is sure to be noted at the Oscars this year.
B001C08RHA|4.0|I have a physical Disability  somewhat  visually impaired  This was nice way to purchase  instead of ordering DISABLED VAN  an need help finding in a local store for shopping  Yes I like this item  and I approve  unless you are more  physically able to go store by store  to find the purchase  you need  this one included
B000N3SS80|3.0|Overall I would say this is a good album. Her songs evoke a lot of emotion and the lyrics are good. The only problem is that jennifer's Spanish is a little strange. I speak spanish (not perfect by any means) and when I listen to the cd I can tell that she sings mostly from memorization. She doesnt seem to feel the words as opposed to singing them because she memorized them. There is a halting quality to her words and she doesnt stress them the way that somebody else would.
B001CD6MA6|5.0|we saw this at the theater, but they were still excited to get it on dvd. there's plenty of action and cool cars, along with a little plot twist. this movie looks like it will be hit with these guys for a long time to come.
0446579939|5.0|Sparks has done it again. He made my eyes burn, from fatigue, that is. I was determined to finish this book today and I did. Hooray! (I started reading it about two weeks ago, but never had the time to really get into it.)<br /><br />What a great storyteller Sparks is. As I neared the end of the book I was about to curse him, though. I didn't want it to end the way he was leading up to. I don't want to ruin it for you, so I won't go into too much detail. In a nutshell, it's about a guy who has stumbled upon a photo that his best friend insists is a lucky charm, keeping Thibault - or Thigh-bolt, as the meanie character Clayton refers to him - safe from harm. The story follows Thibault from the hell of Iraq to a small town in North Carolina, as he searches for the girl in the photo. It is a fabulous love story with an exciting ending that will keep you turning pages, while hoping for the best. Another very-deserving best seller for Sparks.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melodie Gardot is simply extraordinary.  How a person as young as she can sing with such depth and grit is just beyond me.  Kudos to her for her perseverance and astonishing talent.  Look out; she is going to take the jazz world by storm!
1401207138|5.0|Amazing book. Lost my anciente collection a while a go, but this book is just a perfect replacement.
0765348276|2.0|...this book is the Kid's Meal.    Lightweight science, philosophy, dialogue, plot.    After Pournelle, Drake, Haldeman and Heinlein, this is pitiful stuff.    If you're looking for purely entertaining space opera, look up Bujold.    The Heinlein quote on the cover suckered me in; won't happen twice.
B000FA5QS6|5.0|This is avery insightful book that I would recommend to anyone. I downloading the book on my kindle a few days ago and i just finished reading it last night. I especially found the detailed reminder of the problems we have in our society today including racism and prejudice. This is a very good book to sit and read on the weekend.
B001C08RHA|4.0|The graphics are top notch. The animators even show off a bit at times, which is acceptable i suppose. The story is a little iffy though.    Basically tony stark gets kidnapped, makes iron suit, escapes, jealous coworker steals his idea.     The good part of it are, the story is actually entertaining, it has flynn from tron, great cg graphics.    the bad, it milks the arabian terrorist routine to make stark look more like a hero. to me that is a little insensitive to the people who actually lost people in iraq/afghanistan  blah blah blah, and people who are arabian. granted it doesnt depict all arabians like that. but i'm not sensitive, but i can just guess the convoy scene might make a few widows burst into tears.     robert downy jr. does a very good job playing annoying people. only seen 2 movies with him (natural born killers and this). he seems like a nice guy, and pulls off being ironman fairly well. even makes his character appear to mature during the picture.     my overall verdict is, its definitely worth buying. it is has a decent amount of tragedy, comedy and action. its not the best of all movies, but does not fall into the mediocre to sucky movie range.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I received my product in a very timely manner and it was just as described.  Very happy with my item
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Well, I don't have blue ray, yet, but this dvd, with the upscaling dvd player was awesome!  Excellent story of love, the future, and silly robots, with lots of mature meaning to many things.  Not sure the kids will \\"Love\\" this movie, but many adults will.  Worth the money.  Not yet used the \\"Digital Copy\\" on the computer or anything yet.  But nice to know I have it.  I'd buy this dvd again!
B000VDDDY6|4.0|The new enhancements are great! My only complaint with this set is there is no master list of episodes and what disc they are on. However, die-hard trekkies like us are ok with that, just put any disc in and enjoy.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|It was painful to watch this movie.  One the few movies I stopped midstream.  What utter trash and horrendous script containing an abundance of unnecessary profanity.  Yeah, I appreciate spoof movies but this one is a must avoid.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album is like a dream that you never want to end...But when it does, you feel OK.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Nice to have the episodes together in one place, not one year at a time.  I was disappointed that the reunion TV movie wasn't included.
0545128285|4.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard, mentioned in the final Harry Potter novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is a collection of five stories for young magical children, much like the fairy tales we Muggles tell our own children. Translated by Hermione Granger, The Tales also include commentary and notations by Albus Dumbledore, which were found among his effects after his untimely death.<br /><br />Let's be honest: what is there to criticize? It's another piece of the Harry Potter phenomenon that will appeal to any fan of the series. Children who are Harry Potter fans will likely enjoy the Beedle Bard's tales, while adults will find the Dumbledore's notations more interesting.<br /><br />For anyone who has collected the Harry Potter series, I would recommend this volume if for no other reason than to round out your collection.<br /><br />If you're not a collector of the books, this little \\"extra\\" is not going to enhance the series or provide any additional insight into Harry.<br /><br />If you've never read the Harry Potter series (is there anyone left out there?), then I honestly cannot think of any reason you might want to pick up this book.<br /><br />Me? I'm a Harry Potter collector, so this book was a must-have for me!
0618918248|5.0|I just finished \\"The God Delusion\\" and I was challenged by the intellectual rigor of his arguments (I'm an atheist, so in that way he was \\"preaching to the choir,\\" har har, but I had never considered the rightness of this view from so many angles) as well as warmed by the true compassion he shows in discussing those who have had their lives ruined, wasted, or trivialized by religion. For every false \\"comfort\\" Dawkins takes away, he replaces it with a true comfort, that of wonder, curiosity, knowledge, and the promise of greater understanding.<br /><br />Never give up -- that is the message of this wonderful book. Religion is giving up the search for truth, and beauty, and the meaning of life.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I could not do anything else just watch the 7th season, and I was sad it was over.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|I have been listening to this group since before it became mainstream, and for the first time I am disappointed with a release.  I find Dark Horse rather manic in the song themes - jumping from almost extremes in love songs to sex and drugs overload.  Not sure what they were trying to accomplish here, but it seems very disjointed.  Not that the actual music itself (sans lyrics) isn't good, and that they haven't had extremes before, but this one just doesn't do it for me.        As other disappointed reviewers said, listen to the available clips first, find the lyrics online, check it out first before you buy it.  I wish I had.  I would've just downloaded the few tracks I think are worth the money.  Too bad - they've always had a sure sale with my circle, but it'll be different in the future.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I cannot add anything to what has been said before, just wanted to put my five star rating on this film as well as this release.
030014332X|5.0|Excellent book. After so many other attempts of getting a comprehensive yet child level book, this is the perfect match. Reads like an action novel full of details yet entertaining. Short chapters make the perfect read for each night. My son loves it and gets excited about reading it as if it were an action movie. Highly recommended.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love all the songs on this soundtrack.  The movie was great and so is this CD.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settler's of Catan is a great game for kids and adults alike.  Kids need to learn the value of supply and demand and prioritizing.  My sons love that they can design the board themselves to make it \\"even better\\".  I haven't bought any of the add-on's or expansions yet, but probably will soon.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|I'm a fan of Stephen King. Years ago I read this story and expected the film to be terrific.    What a disappointment ... Although the movie itself is good, I would NOT recommend to buy it because of its twisted ending.    I'm trying to buy only movies that I think I wish to enjoy more than once. I am 100% sure that I'd NOT want to look THIS ending again.  If you did it once and you are sane person  - 1 time is more than enough.    Conclusion - may be worth to look once (e.g. rent) but there is NO SENSE in buying it.
0743270754|5.0|This is a fascinating book it, is hard to put down. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a very skilled writer who captures the various personalities of Lincoln's  rivals and their families.   I highly recommend  this  book for anyone who enjoys the  interaction and maneuvering of political opponents.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|As a long time Loreena McKennitt fan, I was thrilled to learn about her new Christmas album, \\"A Mid Winter Night's Dream.\\"  Her previous full length Christmas CD, \\"To Drive the Cold Winter Away\\" was a regular in my holiday play list and I am happy to add this one as well.    This CD has Loreena's regular blend of celtic and midde eastern sounds, combined beautifully.  I especially like \\"Noel Nouvelet\\" and \\"Gloucestershire Wassail.\\"  I also really like the modal/minor take on \\"The Holly and the Ivy.\\"  As always, Loreena's voice soars with beauty and clarity on all the vocal selections.      I do have to say that I think I like the original version of \\"Snow\\" from \\"To Drive the Cold Winter Away\\" better than the reworked version on this album, although it is still a solid offering.    Overall, I LOVE this album, and so does my family (I have yet to get it back from my father who was borrowing it from me!)
1595141715|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is a really mesmerizing book. I curled up with it one evening, expecting to read part of it and then go to sleep. Instead, I stayed up late into the night, determined to discover what happened to Hannah. Asher is really a master at building suspense. It's a quiet suspense, not heart-pounding, but he propels the story forward in a masterful way. Anyone who picks up this book should expect to want to read it in one sitting.<br /><br />The book is definitely heartbreaking. It exposes how poorly teenagers really can and do treat one another. There are consequences to being mean, even if you can't see it right away. Like Clay, I was secretly hoping that there was some sort of mistake, that Hannah wasn't really dead and that she was doing the whole thing to teach some sort of cruel lesson. I wanted her to be alive, I wanted her to see that the world isn't a horrible place and that there are kind people in it. I had a degree of emotional investment in Thirteen Reasons Why; it captured me and still hasn't let me go, even after finishing the novel.<br /><br />The characters are extremely well written. Each is well-rounded and has their own place within the story. Asher must have taken some time in mapping out the direction of the plot because it is very tightly weaved and intricate. Through Hannah's words, it is easy to see how each person affected her and why. The narration is also very effective - Hannah's thoughts in italics, Clay's in normal script. Though it was a bit confusing at the beginning, I got used to it quickly. It was very interesting to see one person's thoughts and another person's immediate reactions.<br /><br />The one problem I had with the book? The entire premise. I don't like the idea of someone telling someone else \\"you are the reason I killed myself.\\" Yes people can be cruel; we've all experienced it at one time or another. And I'm not saying that these actions don't matter and I'm not saying Hannah is completely wrong. I'm just saying I'm uncomfortable with the whole idea of it.<br /><br />Still, Thirteen Reasons Why is a thoughtful and well-written novel that I would recommend to adults and teens alike. Anyone who reads it will find something to think about, something to ponder. I know I'm still thinking about it days later.<br /><br />4.5 stars rounded up to 5saying I'm uncomfortable with the whole idea of it.<br /><br />Still, Thirteen Reasons Why is a thoughtful and well-written novel that I would recommend to adults and teens alike.

B001E1GXPA|5.0|I have to say, I thought that with their earlier CD 'The Crusade' Trivium had sort of lost a little of their power and awe inspiring drive that was so evident in 'Ascendancy'. But with 'Shogun' Trivium have served up a combination of both earlier works and engineered the most mind blowing masterpiece i have heard in a long time.     If their was ever a CD that has created such a phenomenal comeback, it has to be Shogun. I honestly can't stop listening to it. Mat's vocals are so powerful, the lyrics and the singing are by far the biggest hit with me. Not just that though. These riffs that Trivium have created just blow the mind - Kirisute Gomen - unbeatable!! Trivium have also created this air of mystique on Shogun that is so very rare in music these days.    I have to say, i was pleasantly suprised, and so glad i was blown away when i bought this CD. You will be too. A perfect 10/10.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I watch alot of movies and this is by far my favorite movie right now. I have at this point watched it at least 50 times.<br /><br />That being said this is a beautifully acted and paced story that will tug at your heart strings. Every time I watch it I fall in love with it all over again. Trevor Wright as Zach is phenomenol especially with how he can convey his feelings with a look or action and no words are spoken (most noticably the smile on the way home after the first night together and a hug with Shaun near the end)<br /><br />Everyone was fantastic in this but I wanted to hit the sister character with a blunt object every time she opened her mouth, I absolutely detested her character but understand her importance to the movie (but I don't have to like it.)<br /><br />So watch it now.. and later too. And if you haven't already watch it with the commentary. In fact I think it is time to watch it right now.. I am in need of a BGLM.<br /><br />Enjoy
0375826726|5.0|I enjoy this author very much.  He gets slightly verbos at times but it doesn't detract from the story.

B001IZZEEI|5.0|While it is -- frustratingly -- the third in a \\"triple dip\\" (following the theatrical DVD and extended cut DVD), if you are a \\"Sex and the City\\" collector / completist, then you cannot be without this set.    Discs One and Two are essentially the same as they are on the Extended Cut DVD release -- BUT!! -- Disc Two is *expanded* with three more featurettes that were obviously held back from the previous release so hard-core fans would have incentive to buy this package.      One featurette focuses on how they brought the movie to the screen, the second is about on the four leading ladies and the third is the HBO First Look program, \\"The Making of *Sex and the City.*\\"    On Disc Two of the extended cut release and this package, a conversation between Michael Patrick King and Sarah Jessica Parker takes place.  Disc Three features the full conversation, greatly expanded.  It plays as a \\"video commentary\\" (with many split screens and zooms in and out) to the theatrical cut of the film.   Disc Three also adds a feature on the DVD release party and the day Sarah Jessica Parker did the scene with all the wedding gown changes.    Disc Four is a music disc that is worth it for me because of two additions.  As a major aficionado of film scores, I am excited to find Aaron Zigman's \\"suite\\" (really two pieces from the film) on the disc and a notation that his score will soon be available on CD.   I am also pleased to find the \\"alternate\\" version of \\"Labels and Love\\" on the disc.  This \\"alternate\\" is what plays underneath the opening of the film.      Jennifer Hudson's song is also here, as are four songs \\"inspired by\\" the movie and the Pfeifer Bros. version of the SATC theme that is featured on the first volume of the movie soundtrack.    The box, designed like the wedding invitation to beat all wedding invitations, comes with a Certificate of Authenticity (only 85,000 of these things exist) and a slim hardcover book with pictures and quotes not only from the screenplay, but the\\"love letters from great men\\" referenced in the movie.      Overall, this is a FANTASTIC package both in terms of design and content.
B000G6BJS0|1.0|Usually, I don't give reviews because I feel, especially when it comes to music, I am not a very good critic. In the case of this product, it is only reasonable and kind advice to fellow humanity to say the following: Avoid this product; CD no. \\"6\\" is completely defective, as there is a rapid, loud, \\"skipping/clicking/popping\\" noise, which is unacceptable listening; CD no. \\"9\\" has a similar problem that's just half as bad as no. \\"6\\", which is still unacceptable in my opinion.    All that said, if you don't mind missing out on Shostakovich's \\"Symphony no. 7\\" (CD no. \\"6\\") or the last part of his \\"Symphony no. 11\\" (CD no. \\"9\\") the performances are great.
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Let me preface this by stating that this review is for the 2-disc standard DVD (not the Blu-ray). While I would give the movie a solid 5 stars, I have to echo the sentiments of previous reviewers in that this DVD's features are exceptionally disappointing (thus earning only 3 stars overall). With regards to the picture and sound quality of the film itself, I have no complaints. But WB really did a number on those of us who have not yet embraced the \\"Blu-Ray\\" age. In terms of features, it's pretty evident that WB rewarded the Blu-Ray purchasers and will inevitably be releasing an even more \\"special\\" edition down the road in an attempt to bilk us standard DVD users out of even more money later (because a nearly $1 billion worldwide box office take just wasn't enough for them-not to mention the initial DVD sales, the toys, the licensing, etc.). If you must own this movie, I would suggest (like others before me) that you buy the single disc edition, because the 2-disc set simply isn't worth the extra money you'll pay. Quite frankly, I'm angered that WB would do this, but hardly surprised. This tactic has been employed by movie studios and manufacturers since DVDs came to be. Well guess what WB? This is the only edition of the DVD that I'm ever going to own. I won't play this stupid game and feed you greedy @$$h*le$ any more money (I'm sure all you WB execs are losing sleep even as I write this)...
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I have been a long time fan of Dido since I first heard her voice with her brother's group Faithless. I have enjoyed her first two solo albums a lot. SAFE TRIP HOME has been a long awaited follow up to Dido's second album LIFE FOR RENT. I must say I was a bit let down with SAFE TRIP HOME. I can hardly believe that \\"Don't Believe in Love\\" is the first single off Dido's album. It is easily the weakest song on the album. I don't think it has any melodies, if it does they certainly aren't memorable like on Dido's previous albums. I also wasn't really keen on \\"It Comes and it Goes\\". I didn't care much for the melodies on that song. The overall mood of the album is pleasant. The music is particularly enjoyable as background music while kicking back with beverage of choice after a long day at the office. One of my favorite tracks on the album is \\"Quiet Time\\". I love relaxing to that song. The subtle electronic beats and Dido's gentle vocals is ideal music to relax too. What I didn't really care for about the album is that the songs practically sounded alike and no memorable pop hooks. I can't say SAFE TRIP HOME is bad but I can't say it is very good either. SAFE TRIP HOME is an album where the anticipation was not worth it.
031606792X|5.0|The final book in the Twilight series was not a disapointment. I enjoyed it greatly. I just wish that there were more books in this series.
0143038583|5.0|This is the third book by Pollan I've read, each one better than the other. If you're concerned about the food you and your family are eating, read this and start to improve your lives.
0956010903|5.0|I was immediatly impressed by the quality of the binding. It is on of the finest books i own (ignoring antiques). I absolutley love it, it is well worth buying, it is somthing that I will read to my children and grand children someday (for sure). bedies that it's a fun read and the money goes to a great and often ignored cause.
B001BKG9SK|4.0|Excellent, but I'm biased as everything by David Gilmour is excellent. Sad to see Richard Wright not looking well but he's in a better place by far now!! Keep on rocking Richard!!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|On first listen I was not really sure that i liked the new album.  It is hard hitting in the drum section and guitars actually take a back seat.  This part I do like.  When I actually had a minute to listen to it I loved it and think that there is not even one song on it that I don't care for.  Worth the money all the way.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I am a little late coming onto Muse.  This is my loss completely.  Listening to this album changes the way I feel about music.  It is raw, powerful, emotional and hauntingly beautiful.  It makes listening to other music hard, as most everything else I hear sounds comparitively like uninspired drivel, a waste of sonic space.  Everyone of these songs is indeed over the top, and as bombastic as people say (save maybe Blackout) but they are so thrilling to listen to that you are happily carried over with them.  I would recommend this album to anyone ...the vocals, guitars, piano, arrangements are a lovely example of musical creativity at it's best.
B000PSVRL8|5.0|In a way I'm sorry I may have kept someone else from buying this but I just have to make sure I always have a copy of it. Just look at the names. Can you get it like I do? These are the people. I heard them all together in cheeeeep joints in UK '69 etc. Just too much to let go past. John M about that time too.  If you find this and still have a turntable, BUY IT! Diane Traver, Chip, Don, What a summer it was, I will never forget, will always cherish. Dorien de Lusignan, Zuni VA
B00005JMCW|5.0|Ok, of course I have to like this movie a little for me to be over 20 and bought this movie. I thought it was really good...even better than the original. The movie came in a timely fashion and it was in GREAT condition!! Like new! I was impressed! So, five stars!! Thanks!! Oh and the price was really nice!
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I've never purchased a John Legend CD before as I'm not truly a fan of his music. However, after being persuaded by my 6 year old (Greenlight is his favorite)I have become a fan. This CD took a couple of times to hear to get the groove, but now I play it everyday. The selection range is amazing.  We can jam to Greenlight, mellow out to \\"No Other Love\\" and reflect on \\"If you're out there\\". I look forward to his next CD.
0143038419|2.0|I read the first \\"section\\" of the book and it was just okay. Maybe because I've been to Italy and knew the places she spoke of, etc.  The second section bored me and I didn't even bother to finish the book. It constantly felt like Gilbert was bragging, blah blah blah I left my husband but it's okay b/c I have wealthy publishers to finance a trip around the world for me, and so on.  I can't connect with that.  Don't waste your time or money.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This cd gets better everytime I listen to it. I think every song has been a favorite at one point.
B001J53X9U|4.0|The Movie is wonderful, but that's not what I am rating/reviewing. The quality of the batpod is strictly OK; it is mediocre grade plastic with a bad paint job. The metal replica will cost a whopping $95. Meh, during these hard times, spending a hundred bucks for the metal batpod (by itself;excluding the discs) is a waste. And so is the plastic one that this set comes with. But hey, giving just the blu ray disc as a gift kind of looks bad, so the box set along with the digital copy helps. But if you're buying it for yourself, save your money and buy the regular blu ray copy.
B001FBSMW6|2.0|I want to start out saying that like most people here I am a huge Keane fan. We must like them enough to take the time to write about them. Who can not like their first two albums. They are what music should be. They are brilliant. I am not saying Perfect Symmetry is bad. The lyrics are just as good as the first two cd's but you have to hear them through the 80's electronica. The problem with this cd is there are only a handful of songs that come close to the first two cd's. Too much of the cd has Keane letting the synthesizers, drum machines and other electronica take over their songs. They do not rely on their natural talent. Tom's voice seems different on this cd. I can't put my finger on it. It is less emotive and a little more cold. It is hard to describe. If you listen to this cd and then Hopes and Fears or Under the iron Sea you can tell. Tim's beautiful piano is replaced by a synthesizer. The exception is a beautiful little song on the cd(you don't see me). \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" is a good song as is \\"you don't see me\\", \\"playing along\\", \\"black burning heart\\" and \\"love is the end\\". This is not a cd I can put in my player and not worry about hitting the skip button. When I play their first two cd's I never even have to look down at the cd player. I still sit in my car after reaching my destination and wait for the song to end if I am listening to the first two cd's. I do not have  that love of the song when I hear their new tunes. I hope the next one will be more stripped down again and let their talent shine.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|I was a wee bit disappointed with QoS.No \\"Bond,James Bond\\"(standard feature in any Bond film). No one in their right mind sends an office girl out to bring in an agent of Bonds calibre(Strawberry Fields).  No gadgets, just bare hands and guns. Great to see him in vehicles other than flash cars though.  Still a real good action movie. Daniel Craig is great and does what the original Bond from the Ian Fleming novels does. His Job!! Craig's brought the ruthlessness back which is how he should be.It goes with the territory.  Hope his next four Bond films have better story lines and better villains.Here's an idea.John Gardner wrote a few Bond novels.Gadget person was a female whom Bond immediately nicknamed\\"Q'ute\\" That could be fun.  QoS will still be added to my collection.

0553296981|4.0|For a person first picking up this book, it may appear from the cover and summary that this is a diary written by a girl describing the Holocaust and how it pertains to her. However, the focus of this book is much more subtle than that.<br /><br />Anne Frank is a thirteen year old living during the time of WW II and the Holocaust. When her family has to go in hiding to avoid persecution and capture by German soldiers, Anne records their experiences in this diary. Most of the time it deals with trivial items such as boyfriends, the weather, the food, and other things. Some readers might be disappointed in the lack of directly-related Holocaust events. However, this is a diary of a typical 13-15 year old girl that just happened to be living while the Holocaust was taking place. I myself was a little disappointed by the lack of historical facts, but this diary is nevertheless a true account of how people lived, reacted, and perished during the Holocaust. Anne's day-to-day activities realistically simulate what it would have been like to have actually lived during such a terrible time in our history. Her writing is quick, fluid, and engaging.<br /><br />The only downside of this book is that sometimes it is a bit hard to go through it. Some of the diary entries are somewhat boring and there is a lot of repetition in some entries - for example, the constant feud between Anne and her father/mother is a recurring element.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book may not satisfy history buffs, but will interest the average reader for a while. For those who cn see past Anne's words and experience this as a piece of history, though, this is a treasure trove.

B000K4X2UQ|5.0|I haven't looked at the Whitesnake catalog in a while so I missed the March 2007 release of this double CD. Being a long-time Deep Purple fan, I followed the careers of everyone after they broke up so knew who Whitesnake was LONG before 1987, and originally bought the single album release of this when it was came out in 1980. Then, early the next year, my buddy in the army (the same one who turned me onto Budgie, Marillion and Saxon) sent me the double album from England as a birthday present. Only saw it one more time, several years later, and it was a $30-35 import at some independent record store in Florida.<br /><br />So, if you are curious as to what the \\"real\\" Whitesnake sounds like, what they were before Coverdale turned them into a corporate hair-metal band so they could sell millions of albums to 15 year old boys - this is a good place to start! Good selection of tracks from two different London Hammersmith shows, 1978 and 1980 (the original, single disc was just the 1980 show). To me, the stand out tracks are Come On, Sweet Talker, Walking In the Shadow of the Blues and my favorite: Take Me With You. (for the record I am tired of Fool For Your Lovin and the original studio version of Ain't Gonna Cry No More is better than this live one). And the 2nd disc adds 2 DP songs, 2 more Whitesnake songs and Come On and Ain't No Love, all from the 78 show.<br /><br />Also, regardless of what another reviewer mentioned - if you REALLY paid attention you would notice there ARE additional tracks from the 1980 show, albeit only 2 - 'Ain't Gonna Cry No More' and 'Ready and Willing', neither of which are on the original, single album/disc release.<br /><br />So - in the statement to launch a 1000 arguments, but long time fans know - the mid/late 80s incarnation was not really even Whitesnake, but just another John Sykes album that happened to have Coverdale singing on it.<br /><br />Anyone who heard any Coverdale material or Sykes material BEFORE 1986 knows this. And listen to the first Blue Murder album (1989) for further proof. It was Sykes, NOT Coverdale who created the Whitesnake sound that launched them into a whole'nother level in the states and Sykes wrote 7 of the 9 songs on the album. (personally I think the Blue Murder album is superior to either late 80s Whitesnake album anyway....sue me)<br /><br />And then Coverdale thought he could dismiss Sykes, continue with the sound, and \\"take the money and run\\". What gall....what ego!<br /><br />Anyway - bottom line - if you want to check out the original Whitesnake, the band many older fans consider to be the true Whitesnake, this is it.<br /><br />Just don't be fooled by the price, this double CD can easily be found for under $25 so just keep looking for it, DON\\"T be suckered into spending $40-50 on a so-called Import.um (1989) for further proof.

B001GZ6QDS|4.0|The special features on this movie are horrid and weak. You'd honestly get more by doing a search for Batman stuff online. I'm not too concerned with the comic book aspect, though it IS interesting. I want to know more about the movie and how it was all put together.<br /><br />I'd been hesitant to see this movie mainly because of the hype with Keith Legend dying of an OD. I waited for it to come out on DVD, and am sorry I missed it in theaters. The plot is great, really keeping your eyes glued to the screen! And Keith Legend's portrayal of the Joker is the best I've ever seen, certainly better than [[ASIN:B001ECYZMW Jack Nicholas]]!! I really love Christian Bale as Batman. He was great in [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins]].<br /><br />I won't go into too much about the plot, as others have exhausted themselves doing. It's a great movie and you won't regret it! I'd recommend renting it for now and waiting to buy any special edition until a much better one comes out.

B001GZ6QEC|2.0|It should be said, first and foremost, that this movie is brilliant. I really think, between this movie and \\"Batman Begins\\" that Chris Nolan has set a new standard for comic-book based movies. He's proven its possible to take them and make them accessible to people without being campy, to include real emotions, even drama, believable and entertaining action sequences, all in a story that is handled seriously. That said, all the performances in this movie are anywhere between great and brilliant, no complaints.    Now where this disc goes wrong is its rather intolerable switching between 16:9 and letterbox (2.4:1) format. The creators of the disc clearly wanted to showcase their occasional use of i-max film, but they must have neglected to realize that not all of us have a 100 foot wall onto which to project these pristine images. The result is that you get sequences where Batman jumps off a tower in Hong Kong in 16:9 (full screen for modern televisions) and the people wandering around in the building 2 seconds later are in letterbox, you see him flying around and crashing through the window in full screen, and then he rolls to a halt in letterbox. This is actually a simplified explanation of what actually happens, because there are actually 3 or 4 more switches back and forth in that one action sequence. Needless to say, it is quite distracting. Its completely bizarre that whey chose to do this, really. I'm sure they were thinking its a good idea, but everyone I've shown it to is not impressed.    Your options? You can live with this, because its not an option to change it. You can buy the DVD which isn't like this, though it is clearly not the same resolution. You can wait until Warner Bros releases another version, which may never happen. What is clear is for the moment you won't be enjoying this movie to the extent you should in HD at this point.
B000ROALCG|1.0|Este cd llego a mis manos por cortesia de un amigo, pues ni cagando me atreveria a comprarlo.  Aun asi, siendo admirador de Hector Lavoe me parecio que podia al menos escucharlo a ver de que se trataba.    No es otra cosa que Marc Anthony tratando de imitar la voz de Hector, cuestion que no tiene nada de interesante.  La orquesta no suena mal pero aun asi le doy una sola estrella.    En mi opinion muy personal, este disco ha tenido acogida porque da la impresion que ya nadie sabe nada de salsa y la unica referencia que tienen es Marc Anthony.  Marc Anthony es un cantante del monton sin nada extraordinario.  Cuando salio cantando salsa a inicios de los 90s cantaba en las teletones en altas horas de la madrugada, teniendo la misma voz que muchos ahora califican de excepcional.  Antes habian mas exponentes de la Salsa (Willie Gonzalez, Eddie Santiago, Lalo Rodriguez, Conjunto Chaney, Puerto Rican Power, Tony Vega, Santa Rosa, Rey Ruiz, Grupo Niche, Hermanos Moreno, incluso Jerry Rivera, etc. etc) y Marc Anthony nunca pudo sobresalir por encima de ellos.  Ahora por ser casi el unico lo han agrandado como si fuera un Hector Lavoe y para colmo incluyen un tema de Jennifer Lopez.    No compren esta vaina y busquen otras opciones.
B000002J1O|5.0|This is one of those albums where,just from the description of it I always really wanted to hear.So needless to say when I got it as part of the new Genesis 1970-1975 boxed set I was very excited. Sometimes albums that sound dynamite on paper fall flat to me when I hear them. But this is not one of them. 'Selling England By The Pound' was the strongest album Genesis made up to this point and made a great follow up to the also excellent [[ASIN:B000002J1M Foxtrot]].What really brings it to life is the strong sense of focus and continuity-the presense or lack of which can either make or break even classic prog-rock. The long songs such as \\"Firth Of Fifth\\",\\"The Battle Of The Epping Forest\\" and \\"The Cinema Show\\" all showcase a wonderful cut-and-paste style of melding two songs together. The songs really really come together because Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins in particular not only compliment each other very well but Steve Hackett and Tony Banks,particularly in his very tasteful use of ARP synthesizers (they never sound too overbearing)have all meshed together in an extrodinary way. But still that isn't what makes this album so great-it's the incredible songwriting. \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"More Fool Me\\",the latter featuring the first lead vocal of Phil Collins on a Genesis album are gentle acoustic oriented songs with really great melodies-the former gets a bit more rockish towards the end of course but maintains the feel. The song that impressess me most on here is \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\"-a short,to the point rock song with both a great groove and a great melody and has a rather quircky dialog (apparently from Gabriel) at the beginning which really lightens up the song. It's not too noticable but the rhythmic grooves that show up on many of these songs would become a strong part of the later Phil Collins-led lineup.There's even a short instrumental \\"After The Ordeal\\" which is important so that people would understand the talent within Genesis didn't only come from Peter Gabriel.We all know now it certainly didn't anyway. The album ends with the brief \\"Aisle Of Plenty\\",kind of a vocal duet between Gabriel and Phil Collins whom,while a strong addition to the band hasn't really established his own vocal identity quite yet-here he more or less is imitating Gabriel.Either way you look at it this is one of those art/progressive rock albums that is singable and above all a lot of fun rather then just a bunch of people trying to be overly serious. And even though some members of Genesis had overly serious outlooks on their music they sure made this one welcoming to all who heard and still hear it.hin Genesis didn't only come from Peter Gabriel.We all know now it certainly didn't anyway.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I live in the USA now but spent the first 35 years of my life in the UK. I recall as a youngster this series airing on ITV on a Sunday morning. It is one of those memories engrained in my memory about what Sundays were all about.<br /><br />Mom doing the laundry on a cold winters morning with the doors open and a freezing kitchen (for that is where most peoples washing machines are in Britain), the shouting and appealing of several pub soccer games being played out on the football fields behind our home, the smell of the Sunday joint slowly cooking on in the over, Jimmy Savile on BBC Radio 1 broadcasting his weekly Savile's Travels show , and the documentary series The World at War airing on the living room TV.  As you can imagine, a series needed to pack a strong punch to be a part of someone's childhood memories and that is just what this series did.<br /><br />From the script to the archive footage to the first class narration of Laurence Olivier, there is simply nothing to fault this show. Though some of the titling looks a little amateurish by modern standards, this only increases the feeling that you are taking part in a little piece of broadcasting history as you watch it.<br /><br />The Second World War was the most important part of our history and helped define the world as it is now. There is no better way to study the events of 1939-1945 than to sit back and watch this documentary series. And if you want your children to have an unbiased and detailed education of the `last great war', I recommend you purchase this video set immediately.<br /><br />I was something special to me to be able to sit and watch this series all over again and appreciate the horror sacrifice our forebears lived through and made in order for us to enjoy the freedoms we all take for granted today.
B000NJM4JS|5.0|Rhino does an excellent job with their surround sound re-masters. Some of the earlier DVD Audio discs, including L A Woman by the Doors, are now collectibles and selling for well above their initial retail price, even when used. This box sex of 12 discs gives you 6 CDS and 6 DVDS. Anyone who has a DVD player will be able to use the DVD discs. They did it right, on the DVDs you get a new stereo master in advance resolution sound, plus a 5.1 DTS remaster which will play on any dvd player (or receiver) that has a DTS decoder, plus you get a 5.1 DVD Audio mix. The sound is very good, as expected, and the entire package is a great value. Each disc has bonus extras such as previously unreleased songs and videos (another great thing about the DVDs, you get picture and sound). Now if we can get Apple/Capitol to release the Beatles in a similar box, wow.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Until I saw his documentaries, I didn't like Michael Moore. I saw his Oscar acceptance speech and thought he was just another loud-mouthed, Anti-American jerk. However, after I saw Sicko, I found that what originally put me off about Michael is what I actually admire about him. I envy his intelligence and his bravery. I thought he just liked muckraking and getting in people's faces, but he does this because no one will answer his questions. We have to ask ourselves: why won't they? Why do they run from him or throw him out of their offices? His objective is to get answers from the people who are supposed to have them. The more people shut doors in his face or refuse to be interviewed makes him all the more determined. With Sicko, I appreciate the humorous anecdotes about our absolutely depressing (and scary) health-care industry, but he doesn't do that just to make it a comedy-but to underscore that our health care industry is just that-a big fat joke. Some of the people he interviews have such horrible experiences that I really thank God I rarely have to go to the doctor. I don't hate going to the doctor because I'm scared, but because I'll have to deal with the ensuing insurance paperwork nightmare. Michael proves that just by asking questions and raising awareness he is able to evoke change-just as he did in his documentary 'Bowling for Columbine' which I also recommend.  Michael doesn't attempt to solve this problem for us but he does stoke a much needed fire. I didn't grow up in the fifties or sixties but from what I've seen, it was a time for activism and change. Today, there is nothing but complacency and the feeling that people no longer have the power. As Michael demonstrates, the government should always fear their people but in our country, it is the other way around. In Sicko, is it so disheartening to hear about so many lives that could have been saved if not for the disgusting absurdity of insurance company \\"policies.\\" There are interviews from insurance company employees who admit there are people who's job it is find loop-holes in a patient's policy or health history just so they may deny a patient coverage or operation. It also includes an examination of absolutely superior health care in other countries-even poor countries! This begs the question: what is stopping us from having that? I really hate to say it but I wish I were living in another country-not because I hate America, but if I've got to be sick, I rather not be here.ce company employees who admit there are people who's job it is find loop-holes in a patient's policy or health history just so they may deny a patient coverage or operation.

B00009MGGI|5.0|House of Cards has to be one of the most intriguing BBC series I've seen in quite some time. I'm not one who finds politics compelling, but this series manages to draw you in to the \\"games\\" politicians love to play, in this case, with each other. There is absolutely nothing they won't do. They'll ruin marriages, set up the occasional \\"necessary\\" murder, and blackmail each other with explicit photos. Ian Richardson is at the heart of this drama as Francis Urquhart, the scheming British Prime Minister who loves to \\"put a bit of stick about.\\" He's deliciously evil but throughout the series, I loathed his character. Really. He gets away with EVERYTHING. He's too smart and too clever and he's 100 steps in front of his enemies. Will his reign of terror ever end? That's really the kicker for this series: who has the guts to bring him down??? The writing for this series is brilliantly adapted by Andrew Davies who's talent also extends to other BBC productions like Vanity Fair, Pride and Prejudice, and Bleak House. All of the supporting characters are marvelously cast-especially Colin Jeavons as F.U.'s toady, Tim Stamper. House of Cards is an absolute masterpiece. Beware: you will get sucked in!

B00005JPKE|5.0|To most Eastwoods 'Flags of our Fathers' wasn't that great in telling the story of those soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima. I personally loved that film and was delighted to see that Eastwood had done what rarely is, and told the other side to that story from the perspective of the Japanese army. Iwo Jima takes a very similar approach to telling the story of the main soldiers by zooming back and forth from past to present, explaining how the soldiers got to where they where and what they've left at home. I can certainly see the difference between this and 'Flags' and I would certainly rate this as the better, yet would not be willing to shut down 'Flags' in a hurry.<br /><br />Iwo Jima gives what seems to be an open view on the side of the Japanese and touches upon the Honour principle as to how the soldiers fought without cowardice or retreated with dishonour. This is a strong film when touching upon the Honour principle that the Japanese live by. It even touches upon the fact that some soldiers were actually killed if they displayed any sort of cowardly behaviour and would sooner kill themselves than surrender. It's an emotional experience to watch these Japanese soldiers who don't really want to fight, but are forced into it for fear of being executed as traitors if they refuse.<br /><br />The island of Iwo Jima is the last part preventing the USA from taking Japanese mainland. Because of this the Japanese are desperate that American soldiers don't take the island, so the Japanese Imperial Army employ General Kuribayashi to develop a strategy that would defeat the American army. However, the general does not approve of the rigid traditional approach by some of his sub-ordinates. He also begins to resent the resistance from the sub-ordinates to follow his new commands and new ideas which he hopes would help defend the Island. In the lower ranks is a young soldier Saigo who, in his home life is a small town baker now forced with the struggle to overcome the inevitability of his death along with his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />Eastwood has a way of making films that is unmatched by any other film maker today. He's shockingly brilliant and although I'm not crazy over his acting, his directing is truly superb. He manages to blend large scale CGI with blood and guts and the truly emotional story together perfectly to give the viewer one hell of a movie going experience. If you're not a fan of foreign films then this may not be your kind of film due to it being entirely in Japanese. The acting of Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya is just second to none, and will hopefully introduce the greatness that foreign films even if directed by Americans, can be truly superb without the recognition an English speaking film would gain.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this film to anyone put off by the fact that it's Japanese speaking.

As I read about these Seals and especially the four that were assigned this mission it made me so thankful and grateful for these kinds of guys that are serving in our armed services. I also was very pleased to read his take on the media and the far left liberals and how they have made it extremely hard on our troops doing the actual day to day fighting in both fronts.    This  is a book that anyone who is patriotic, loves reading a page turner will very much enjoy this one, and end the reading feeling very proud of our fighting men and women who are out there defending all that is good about the human race in spite of the nay sayers.

Vocalization good, timing good, phrasing good, some slurs, which may be good or bad depending upon what caused them.  Hopefully not what brought Billie down.  Get her act while you can.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved this movie.  The music is wonderful, the location beautiful and the story sweet and positive.  There is just something about it that makes me smile.  The music is great.    I loved Meryl Streep in this movie.  Her acting was fabulous.  I am not as happy about her singing.  She tries hard and sometimes does well but other times she is not as successful.  It almost makes me wish for the days when movies were dubbed by a better singer.  That being said I like her in this role so much that I am willing to accept her sometimes less than stellar singing ability.  It is well worth seeing.
B000059XUO|5.0|Tragedy was thick with the production of this film. Not only did a relative of star Ernie Hudson's die during production, we also lost a great actor and indeed a great person on the set with Brandon Lee, who died of a malfunction during a scene in which he gets shot. Ironic and tragic, Brandon Lee left us  with a fantastic swansong, and a bitter taste of what would have come had he not tragically met fate during shooting.<br /><br />As sad as that is, we are blessed with a beautiful, moody film that can only be described as a true gothic offering. James O'Barr's simple, yet completely captivating, comic set the grounds for what can easily be described as one of the best comic book movies to ever grace the cinematic world.<br /><br />Eric Draven, along with his fiancee, Shelly, are brutally murdered by a gang of vicious thugs the night before their wedding- October 31st. Exactly one year later, Eric is brought back from the dead to avenge their deaths, and in his quest for vengeance, clean up the streets of the city in which they lived.<br /><br />Alex Proyas shot a film that easily defined his career. There's an abundance of moody, gothic atmosphere that has the classic feel of an Edgar Allen Poe world. Indeed, the film matches up to the very definition of Gothic, both in terms of the set pieces and the overall look of the film. Everything seems so saturated, with greys and blacks being the primary colors, but we also get to be treated to a tone of orange and reds throughout the film. Alex got everything he could out of his actors, but with such a stunning cast as it was, he didn't have to give much direction to any of them.<br /><br />Astounding in the role of Eric Draven is Brandon Lee, who was the definitive Crow, and also the only man I can ever see playing the Crow. Brandon really embodied the role, seeming to put a lot of himself into, though I doubt Brandon was such a vindictive person in real life. Even though coated with makeup, you could still tell that this was Brandon Lee, the ultimate Brandon Lee, the only and only Brandon Lee. Like Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, we can see that to Lee, this was more than just another role- this was something that Brandon believed in, and he gave it his all, both in terms of what he was able to do as an actor and, tragically, his own life.<br /><br />Ernie Hudson, who I have always thought is an extremely underrated actor, gives us a great performance as Sergeant Albrecht. He is witty, smart, clever, and extremely unique, doing things his own way and not caring what the consequences may be. His eventual role as a partner to Eric is completely believable, and to see him in one of his best roles ever was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Young Rochelle Davis as Sarah also did a good job, though at time I felt that she was a little too dry, and that she didn't really know at times what she was doing. In some ways, that worked in her favor. It described the naivety of children, and also fit her character at times, who has seen darkness and just stopped caring about the light. Her tragic loss of two people that took care of her, loved her, is apparent, and you can't help but feel something when she finally reunites with Eric.<br /><br />We don't even need to go into how good Michael Wincott was as Top Dollar, nor do we need to dissect David Patrick Kelly as T-Bird. These two did a fantastic job in their respective roles, bringing truly evil characters to life.<br /><br />What this DVD has for us is something wonderful. Deleted scenes, an interview with James O'Barr, a behind-the-scenes feaurette with some great interviews with Brandon Lee and Ernie Hudson, story boards, extended scenes- everything you could want from a movie. The folks at Miramax gave us what will probably always be the definitive version of the film, and they did a good job with what they gave us. There could be more, but I am happy with what we were given.<br /><br />All in all, The Crow is a intense, moody film, packed with rich, interesting characters played by top-notch performers. Tragic that Brandon Lee is no longer with us, but we can always thank him for giving us this triumphant film, and hope that wherever he is, he knows that we have not forgotten about him. Rest in peace, Brandon Lee. You are dearly missed.rmers. Tragic that Brandon Lee is no longer with us, but we can always thank him for giving us this triumphant film, and hope that wherever he is, he knows that we have not forgotten about him. Rest in peace, Brandon Lee. You are dearly missed.
B000006IUQ|1.0|All in all, The Edge is a pretty decent movie -- with plenty of fine cinematography of the Alaskan wilderness, excellent action sequences with the BEAR, and good performances by Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin and Harold Perrineau.     But I couldn't get over the fact that none of the three plane crash survivors had enough common sense to approximate which way was south -- not even Hopkins, who was supposed to be genius. I mean, at midday, when the sun's at it's peak, it's position in the sky would be roughly due SOUTH (and when Hopkins first made his floating needle compass, the sky was clear and sunny). Yet, they all relied on his cheesy compass, which caused them to unwittingly loose their direction and find themselves at their starting point a day later and after many miles of hiking.    Other actions by Hopkins were similarly stupid. For instance, when rescuing Baldwin from his plunge into the deadfall bear trap (shortly after Baldwin was about to kill him), Hopkins pulls the half-buried wooden spike, which had pierced Baldwin's leg, straight up, which would drag an incredible amount of dirt into the puncture wound -- greatly increasing the degree of infection. (A smarter idea would have been to cut the spike and lift Baldwin's leg off of it.) Another dumb move was not to keep some kind of fire or torch burning at all times, so that they could both conserve their SIX matches and be ready to immediately start a larger fire in the event that a search plane or helicopter was seen or heard. (And those six matches seemed to remarkably light as many fires, suggesting that none were lit for naught.)     Further, how could Balwin -- after the three survivors had already been chased by a Kodiak man-killer -- leave a blood-soaked pant leg (cut from Perrineau's trousers after he wounded himself with a knife) on a tree limb, the scent of which would attract any Kodiak for perhaps miles around. And where did that supply of wooden spears come from -- one of which killed the Kodiak -- after the bear chased Hopkins and Baldwin through the woods and over a steep embankment into a stream bed.    Anyway, there were too many inconsistencies of that sort that served to discredit a movie that was otherwise pretty good.
0740748475|5.0|This collection arrived in pristine condition. Unfortunately someone stole my digital camera from my car and I have no other way to take a photo. I am very proud to own this collection. I plan to pass it down to my relatives in the hopes they keep it this way. I will some time in the future get another camera and take photos of this collection.
1416595546|1.0|There is in Russia a school of thought that asserts Communism was visited on Russians by the Jews as a revenge for the pogroms.  Sashenka is ultimately a rejoinder to that - being the story of how even well-connected Jewish Bolsheviks and Communists were destroyed by the system.      It is for the most part a very readable tale.  But, among other things, one can argue that the way some of the threads are wrapped up at the end throw away some of the punch - the irony and poetic justice - of the story line.    Thus, One is probably better off reading Mr Montefiori's non-fiction accounts of the period and wait for the movie version of his novel.
B001MWMVQQ|5.0|Agent Dunham brings a reality to the show that makes it plausible. I really enjoy Walter, with his mental and yet sharp minded way. Some would say this is another attempt at X-files; More like cutting edge to Star Trek. This shows just how science influences our life and how bad it can become. Excellant show looking forward to more.
B001GJOL22|5.0|My first Blu-Ray purchase ever (this was the release to actually convince me to buy my Blu-Ray player).  I knew once Rush had their first Blu-Ray true-HD product that I would take the plunge.  I'm glad that I did.  I could go on and on about the superiority over DVD, but this release proves why the time is now to upgrade your home theater setup.  If you are a Rush fan, this package will return you to the concert hall over and over and over...with an almost godlike seat at the show.  I saw the S&A Tour live from 14th row floor, but THIS is far more enjoyable.  And there is something to be said when a 5-inch disc made of plastic can contain footage and sound that trumps (in my opinion) an actual live experience.  Suffice it to say I have a very large home theater system which includes a sound section that rivals some installations at local bars for their hi-tech dance floors. Today they sell speakers with little 8-inch drivers they call \\"woofers\\".  I feel so bad that Bose and others went the direction of \\"scientific and dainty\\".  My speakers are over 7 years old and I'm never switching until the industry gets back to power.  My L&R mains and L&R surrounds have (2) 12-inch woofers, each!  My subwoofer channel is carried by an 800watt rack amplifier driving two 18-inch woofers in commercial dance floor cabinets.  They make *wind* if necessary.  I am mentioning all this because I found the surround mix on the R30 Tour DVD to be \\"OK\\" and all previous releases (Rush in Rio and back) to be pooooor.  The stereo mixes were fine, but somebody was drunk when they did the Dolby Digital mixes...muddy and yucky.  S&A Live on Blu-Ray has a phenominal (and I mean phenominal) DTS-HD audio mix that *exactly* recreates the live experience.  Perfect tone, mix, warmth, ambience, and depth.  On my system at least, you close your eyes and you are back at the live show for real.  They did a really good job on this one.  I assume the DVD version of this carries a similar mix that is finallya triumph in the surround sound department.      But the winning catch on the Blu-Ray is (no surprise) the picture quality.  The first 60 seconds convinces you that you'll never go back to DVD...ever.  Seeing Alex come out in the crisp white spotlights, you can see every stitch in his clothing, every detail on his guitar, you think you can reach in and pluck the strings.  They're all there, not in a fuzz of traditional video, but like a crisp expensive digital camera photo.  Then comes the launch of Limelight, the stage goes lit, and you sit back in awe.  Neil's gold-plated kit, the video screens, the lights, the crowd...all stunningly detailed.  This was shot in HD, and made for HD.  And you know it.  It's unmistakable.  For the entire show you get to see everything in a way I've never openly noticed in a Rush concert video before.  There were some fans involved in editing or something.  The editors hired must have been Rush fans.  Because they switch the cameras and stick in shots that are the tastiest and coolest ever...head over heels better than even the R30 Tour DVD, which I thought was well done...it only gets wayyy better.  My gawd, they let you see everything.  Geddy's keyboards, Alex's pedalboards, Neil's feet, the dolls and animals all over the stage, and gear from all angles.  On Blu-Ray I found myself pausing over and over again (because you can actually READ the settings on Ged's keyboards, and the notes on Alex's pedals!!)  Tons of audience shots galore.  People singing, headbanging, dancing...and you can see their faces and what it says on their shirts!  I also like they don't necessarily hide the cameras and technical stuff.  You can see the cranes, the cameramen, and the little robotic dolly camera zipping back and forth across the front of the stage.  It's like they set everything up and just said \\"you guys go out there and rock, we'll capture every last drop of it\\"  Well, they did.      Lastly, I think the most hilarious Rush moment in Rush footage history is found on this thing.  During the final credits, NEIL's head appears on the swami-pillow and is attacked by dolls... I literally shed tears it was so funny.  I still can't get over what he said and the expression on his face.  Good to see Neil clown it up.
1595141979|5.0|OMG! I absolutely LOVED this book! It's just as interesting and complex as the first two and I couldn't put it down!   Richelle Mead, you are an excellent author and these books are up in my top three favourite series (Along with Twilight and Harry Potter).    SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't really enjoy the ending of the book though. I couldn't believe Demitri was changed into a strigoi! I'm so sad...  And then Rose left the academy and left Lissa there!  Just horrible...  I hated the ending, and I hope the next book will make things right again in the world of Vampire Academy!    I loved the sex between Rose and Demitri though. It was so great for them to fully stop denying how they felt.    Anyway, it was a great book! The ending was really sad though. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!!!
B000000WA4|5.0|If you like alternative rock, or just Rock n' Roll period, do yourself a favor and buy Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I bought it for one reason: It contains some of the best radio hits of the '90s!     I have a TERRIBLE time trying to remember the titles of the songs I loved as a teenager--thanks in no small part to STP and The Smashing Pumpkins (whose song titles almost never made sense). If you're in the same boat and deciding whether to buy this album, listen to the samples of THESE SONGS (if you listened to rock in the '90s, you'll know every one of them): \\"Zero,\\" \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings,\\" \\"Muzzle,\\" \\"Thirty-Three,\\" \\"1979,\\" and OF COURSE \\"Tonight, Tonight.\\"    What's great about this album is that even though it's LOADED with content, there is NO FILLER--just push play and enjoy. Unless you're a hardcore Pumpkins fan, you won't love every song, but many of them will have you nodding your head to the beat. My favorites (beyond the singles) are \\"An Ode To No One,\\" \\"Jellybelly\\" and \\"Here Is No Why.\\"     This album is practically a greatest hits in its own rite, and if you do as I did and buy it along with Siamese Dream, and you will have every Pumpkins radio hit from the mid-'90s--and in my opinion, ALL of their best work!
0743455967|4.0|The first part of the book is great. It's a free-wheeling largely chronological autobiography with some great insights. The end of that section seems a bit rushed -- like there was a deadline to meet. I wish it could have gone longer.    The second part is more for the experienced writer, not the general public. Although I do like reading about writing (some of Tolkien's stuff is eye opening) but this got dry really fast.    Overall, certainly worth trying out.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|The release of a new concert by Jeff Beck on cd is enough for me to celebrate. In particular this is one exceptional concert and you know, as Jimmy Page said once, that when Jeff is on, \\"he's probably the best there is.\\" Well on these dates from Ronny Scott, he was on. But frankly I have to say that in my opinion, in the past years Jeff has always been on. All his cds from the latest years are spectacular nothing less, studio or live dates as this one. Probably Jeff was more \\"up and down\\" when he was younger, or probably Jimmy's sentence reveals a little envy by the Zep guitarist (in stating that there are occasions, a lot of them Jimmy let us to suppose, that Jeff is off). Anyway, this album is fantastic and Jimmy would be happy to know I guess, that Jeff is ON. And a DVD from this concert is coming out so there will be more money to spend on Jeff in the next future, but I'm happy. What can I say about this release? It's Beck at his best, playing songs from all his history, with a fantastic band (Colaiuta is the drummer!!!!!) with his unbelievable vocal sound, with all his Strato Beckisms and all his paraphernalia of guitar effects. The thing is that his Stratocaster in his hands doesn't seem a guitar. It seems a human, a woman singing. And if you have ever played a strato, which stand to a woman as a chair could do, ... you can understand what I'm saying. Steve Lukather said recently attending to a Jeff Beck concert, \\"Oh! God is playing guitar through Jeff's hands!!\\" Well I agree with Luke.
B001F12J3Y|5.0|I saw this movie with my son (Age 21) in December of 2007 in an IMAX theater in Harrisburg, PA.  Needless to say, it didn't disappoint.  we purchased the 3-D version of the Blu-Ray a week ago.  Although it could NEVER be IMAX, we thought that for a home version, it was fantastic.  I don't understand all of the negative reviews.  Perhaps these folks are expecting the world for $25[...], but realistically, it is worth 10 times the price.  We purchased some higher quality 3-D glasses with the movie because the cardboard just isn't that comfortable.    We turned out all of the room lights and watched the movie on our 52 inch DLP TV.  After allowing 10-15 minutes for our eyes to adjust to the glasses and lighting conditions, we watched the movie with a fairly critical eye.  There were times when there was some ghosting of the images.  However, for the most part, the $25 DVD along with the $7.95/pair 3-D glasses we purchased, was FANTASTIC.  Like I said, it will never equal IMAX, but for home viewing, if you let your mind go, and allow yourself to be a kid again, you'll have a fantastic time watching this soon to be, Christmas classic.    The folks who have reviewed this and hated it are undoubtedly the same type of people who can't enjoy a magic show either.  You must watch this movie in the context that you don't have an IMAX theater in your home, but rather a home sized screen.  If you can open your mind, you'll really enjoy this!  But you must keep things in perspective!!!
B0012GN0JE|5.0|Ok, ok I know what all you fellow Beck lovers are saying (I'm a Beck lover too of course). This is the worst Beck's album ever (I think Beck himself thinks the same...). I undersand why you're saying this, but sorry, I don't agree at all. Or better, I find this album great in its own right. Yes, Flash is incredibly untrendy now for a lot of reason (you can see it by the price it is sold now, 2 dollars!!), but I don't let arrangements fool me. Beck's music here is great as ever. There are reasons why I'm saying this album is great in its own right. First of all, Beck played phenomenally here, phenomenally. The solos are solos only Beck could conceive and play. Unbelievable guitar playing (I'm an expert guitar player, I know what I'm saying). He played more flashy than ever in a sense (and the album was rightly called \\"Flash\\"!!!!) because those were the eighties and excess, machism, and explosive personality were the things. Van Halen was the guy you have to compare with, and Beck could do it easily, so he did with this album and prove he could challenge all the youngers and (Ed apart) win. Second reason is because several songs from \\"Flash\\" are great, great vehicles for Jeff's improvisations. I love them! \\"Ambitious\\", \\"Gut us all in the end\\" (try to play this solo, go, try!), \\"You know We Know\\" (it's faaantastic), \\"Nighthawk\\", \\"Night after Night\\". Obviously the wonderful \\"People get ready\\". They're great songs. Ok the arrangements are eighties, there are synths and drums machines involved, but frankly I don't care at all until the music, the MUSIC is great, and moreover Beck plays like only he could do!!! In a sense those weird and untrendy arrangements make me smile and love this album even more. In my opinion Flash deserves 4 stars, because, yes someone could have the right to hate the arrangements because they are ... peculiar (!!!), but forgive me, I love this album even more just for them (they're sooooo funny!!!) so let me give this album my 5 stars! It's a Flashy rating I know, but I love FLASH!!!! Now it's been remastered, I'll buy another copy!shy rating I know, but I love FLASH!!!! Now it's been remastered, I'll buy another copy!

B00011F5DK|5.0|My in-laws bought Blokus for my son for his 6th birthday...and kept it at their house for the first month before we could pry it away! They promptly bought their own game, and we all enjoy ours at our house. Blokus takes only a moment to learn how to play, but like so many other games it takes a lifetime to master. Each game is a geometrical puzzle somewhere between Tetris and Risk, and you can play with any number of players from one to four. Each way is quite different in strategy, so it's almost like four games in one. Not to mention that it is a real mathematical treat, it'll have you thinking spatially and planning out moves in advance. It'll be a while before my son fully \\"gets\\" the idea...if you have a kindergartener you might try Fundomino instead...but get Blokus, too--it's a real gem!

I bought the book in order to check the quote and found to my dismay that the line is not in the original.  It seems quite clear that a lot of additional material, including some dialogue has been added in order to make the TV episode long enough.  Who wrote the additionl material?  It is difficult to attribute this to Agatha Christie when the material was obviously written after her death.  I was very glad to be able to get hold of the original at a very good price but the purpose of my purchase was frustrated.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I have been deeply impressed with every film that Pixar Studios creates.  Wall-E is their latest contribution to the world of animated features, and again they have raised the bar.  The film is beautifully animated, with a wonderful story told through compelling characters.  A formula, you can tell, that Pixar cares about and they continue to have success.  The first half hour contains very little dialogue, but manages to capture deep emotions through sounds and body language.  If you appreciate a good animated film, Wall-E should not be missed!      The 3-disc special edition contains featurettes on the making of the film and an excellent documentary on the birth and evolution of Pixar studios.  There is also a digital copy so you could watch the film on the go, or during a flight.

B0006J28KU|4.0|Al Pacino plays a cop and an avid hunter who, once he gets a scent of his prey, feels some sort of self-motivation that perpetuates him... He is a jackal addicted to this process... This is an elevated state of being an intensely eager predator pursuing his prey until he gets him down... As strange as it is, as scary as that world is, Lt. Hanna has a social conscience... He has a normal spectrum of human feelings... He's very authentic in how he loves his life...<br /><br />The fusion of Robert De Niro and Neil McCauley is so total... He's committed to the rigidity of that perspective and it's a heartbreaking role... It's a tragic character... In his world, what he's doing, he feels justified in doing it... McCauley has a quiet look at a thief who has a certain kind of lonely disregard for who he kills but yet somehow you're in touch with his humanity... We can identify him when all that robbery turns out badly and when his lover Eady (Amy Brenneman) tries to escape from him... Brenneman's part was the hope that De Niro's character could have of escape, and love, and forgiveness... There's something so sad about these people and so poignant... They are so lost, and they want to be found so badly...It's like a huge opera... On one level, the film deals with a crime saga, on the other, with the interpersonal relationships that are woven all these characters...In the Pacino character and in the De Niro character you're basically seeing two sides of the same tough man...
0330449605|4.0|Kate Morton's second novel is a beautiful tale about three generations of women, all seeking to find themselves in some way. However, the main story is the search for Nell's parentage. The chapters alternate between different characters and times, however each is clearly marked at the start of the chapter and the same part of the storyline generally continues, just told by a different person.     Unlike The House at Riverton, I found that the writing style was very engaging and I wanted to keep reading right though until the end - it was a real page turner for me.
B000FSME1A|4.0|After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975... The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the natives...Coppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, \\"The horror... the horror...\\"<br /><br />In the film, Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia, and eliminate, with \\"extreme prejudice,\\" a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities... On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces, high on dope or drunk with power...<br /><br />Although, as a result of cuts forced on Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre... In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound...<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored... As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is...

My only gripe is on the red vinyl album, they started Help with the guitar solo from James Bond theme and went straight in the the song.  I was wondering why they left this off the CD version?
0783227434|4.0|In the original Evil Dead there was some intention to make a serious horror movie, with Evil Dead 2 a bit of that was retained, but much of it was replaced with slapstick and farce.  In Army Of Darkness there is not a single serious moment to be had in this entire film.  Take a bit of the Evil Dead movies, add a heathy dose of Howard,Fine and Howard, some Errol Flynn, a little Ray Harryhaussen, and every bad line from every second-rate action film ever made.  The end result is nearly only fit for viewing through the lense of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but Bruce Campbell, Sam Raime and company actually pull it off.  If you have any notion that this is a serious horror movie of any sort, you are either going to be very disappointed or extremely confused.  If you loved Evil Dead 2 this will bring you more of the same only far more so, it takes farce to a whole new level and proves that you can make an intentionally \\"bad\\" B-movie, that's better then a great deal of the A-list stuff that's being churned out of Hollywood by the gallon.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a great little flash to start out with, and to carry with you everywhere. It's superior to a built in flash- with an 18-105mm, I get shadows at wide angles with the D60's flash, and of course the built-in flash cannot be bounced.<br /><br />The SB-400 is tiny and light. It's much brighter than the built-in flash, and using it instead will greatly extend how long your camera battery lasts, though at the expense of using AAs in the flash. I have a pair of Energizer NiMH batteries in mine, and have shot at least 100 pictures using this flash, without changing batteries yet. It's small enough to fit into just about any camera bag and take everywhere with you, unlike larger speedlights like the SB-800. It's also about half the price of even the SB-600.<br /><br />It does have limitations. It doesn't pivot horizontally, so you can't bounce it off the ceiling when taking portraits. Also, it has no functionality with Nikon's wireless flash system- the only easy ways I can see to fire it remotely are the SB-28/29 cords, and the SU-4 controller, which will fire the flash you attach when it \\"sees\\" another flash firing. Being able to use this as a wireless slave flash would be nice, and would make this much more versatile.<br /><br />If you're just getting started in photography, not going to use the features of an SB-600/800/900, or just would like a speedlight you can carry in your pocket, this is great. If you're wanting to eventually use multiple or just remote flashes, and don't mind carrying a larger, heavier flash, I'd go with an SB-600 or SB-800.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|I heard great recommendations about this movie & I was a little disappointed when I watched it. The story was not interesting enough. Seinfeld's voice was the only nice thing about this movie.  Einat  [....]
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I love this album, it's amazing.  Especially Life in Technicolor, Cemeteries of London, Lost!, Viva La Vida, and Violet Hill, though all of the rest are really great too, just those are the ones that could be singles(the last two already are).  Don't miss out on this album!
6304696515|5.0|DANGEROUS LIAISONS is the PERFECT good vs. evil story. The two main characters just so happen to be the sleaziest people to ever grace the big screen - or the literary world, for that matter!    You all know the basic plot of the film. It's an intense game of seduce and destroy that keeps you on the edge of your seat. At moments, it is actually quite disturbing. Glenn Close and John Malkovich were the perfect people to portray the evil duo. The best thing about them is that they allow their characters to be multi-dimensional, rather than the cardboard cut out villians of CRUEL INTENTIONS, another film based on this material. You also have the satisfaction of seeing the bad guys get it in the end, yet the film never lets you forget that the innocent end up suffering as well. It's not a happy ending.     If you haven't been introduced to this story yet, see this film. You won't regret it! It's amazing.     Nominated for several Oscars, including Best Actress - Michelle Pfeiffer, as you've never seen her before! Amazing performance. Also, be on the lookout for a young Uma Thurman. Keanu Reeves is also makes an appearance.
0800177975|4.0|This is probably the most self-deconstructing film of all time (something that literary and film students could have a blast with) -- plus, it is action-packed and full of laughs. A winner!
B000068OCS|4.0|I viewed this movie on a watch instantly feature (ie, computer monitor) and the picture was kinda fuzzy. This might be sharper on a DVD form? This film starts off with about 20 minutes of videos of rocks, clouds, water. Then it starts moving into the human aspects. You see the camera swoop over radio antennas (whatever kind of antennas those were). You also see things like: skyscrapers with reflections of clouds, parking lot of multicolored cars, a lot of busy intersections with the film sped up, buildings and a bridge or two being demolished, Twinkie/hot dog/car factory all with music in the background. There is no narration. This movie definitely had a I should watch this in IMAX type feel to it. Some of the nature shots had this high school nature film aura about it. If youre in the mood for something like that, then you should like the film!<br /><br />The title Life out of Balance insinuates that wed be viewing more of a harmful human effect on nature. But I personally felt this film showed more of the hecticness of human life (a lot of the people scenes were sped up). Maybe we are out of balance in this ant/drone like way.... but I didnt get the feeling of destructive with the exception of one or two shots. Some of the skyscraper shots were, well, pretty. I just dont see how that reflected a life out of balance or portrayed our current situation in a horrific, bad-steward-of-the-earth type of way. My personal opinion. Take it or leave it.<br /><br />I loved the Indian quotes (very small part of the film).  But, like I said, I didnt understand how Koyaanisqatsi was displayed in the overall message the film actually put across (ie, the filmer's intentions didnt match what was portrayed on screen).
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I preordered this cd and amazon guaranteed that it was the lowest price. I was really amazed on how fast it got to me. I had the cd in hand a couple of days before it was released out in stores. I do have to say that this album is by far the best album that nickelback has released.
B000G8NXYG|2.0|I did like how when the people were stabbed with an arrow, they died. Not like in today's films, where someone has a bleeding neck and they still are windmill kicking you in the face. Very realistic plot, a few meaningful lines. But still 3 hours, black and white with white subtitles - I fell asleep.  It took me 3 watches just to make it to the Intermission.  SNORE.<br /><br />EDIT: And yes, my rant is going to be longer than my review. . . .<br /><br />To those who merely think I'm stupid:<br />I actually LOVED [[ASIN:B001GLX6TY You Can't Take It with You (Remastered)]] - so its not like I'm incapable of watching a black and white movie.  I have had had pretty polarizing experiences with Japanese films (egs, Hated [[ASIN:B0029KS9FM Grave of the Fireflies]]. Loved [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]]. Both critically acclaimed).  I'm not going to say I loved this movie just because I'm \\"supposed\\" to.<br /><br />To those who think I occasionally forget my helmet when I run outside to chase cars:<br />Thats great and all that this movie has withstood the test of time but I assure you if you stuck a generic action flick that Hollywood put out last month and sent it back in time to the 50's, the bulk of the movie goers would have crapped their pants out of amazement. Conversely, your 13 year old son isn't going to be lured away from Call of Duty because he wants to go outside to push a hula hoop around the yard with a stick.  I thought I'd give this kung fu snore-fest a try seeing how it has SO MANY 4/5 star reviews.  I did.  And it sucked. So there. Lets see your beloved Seven Samurai last after the Miley Cyrus/Bieber crowd grows up.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|These movies are the top example of the best movies ever possibly made. This set includes extra bonus scenes that were not shown in the movie. This set of Star Wars trilogy brings back memories of when I first watched the film. I don't know why you would rate this three and below, who cares if there is not extra stuff in this set this is close to the original so it works for me.
B0012Q732O|1.0|The acting was really monotone and I cared little to not at all about the characters. The main female squeeze of the caveman guy basically stood there the whole movie with a deer in headlights stare/lips parted slightly.<br /><br />PLOT: There's all these soothsayers/old people saying things about this caveman kid. And he fulfills them (by accident). He wasnt trying to fulfill prophecy, he just fell into it. That was one of the little parts I liked about the movie - the whole \\"cant escape your destiny\\" part. I wanted to type \\"feel\\" of the movie, but I couldnt - because there was no feel. So the movie, he is dumbheartedly going after this girl with impetuosity and little to no thought of the others traveling with him - that bugged me. I didnt like that scene where he is giving the people who help him fight this Braveheart-knock off speech . I also thought it was really funny when the caveman girl cried, you could see her mascara running. And we all know Waterproof L'Oreal didnt come out until 9,000 BC.<br /><br />Im anti excessive CGI - you could definitely notice it with the tiger, not so much with the mammoth, and sometimes during the background scenery.<br /><br />There was a hint of mysticism and that bugged me. Not because of the existence of the mysticism in the movie, but because I felt since they introduced that aspect they should have run with it and expand on that part.
B00168OINK|1.0|Amazon's return policy is simple, which is good because we ordered a Kung Fu Panda Blu Ray and all the \\"extras\\" worked, but not the movie (we tried several other Blu Ray dvds and there were no problems); Amazon accepted our return and sent a new copy....same problem - when we selected \\"play\\" the entire player shutdown.  So returned the second dvd and decided did not want to deal with this issue anymore and may purchase locally after I hear if others worked.
B000021Y77|2.0|I dont see what the BFD was about this movie. I mean, yeah she looks cool and they do drugs, yay. I thought the experimental \\"and then\\" parts were kinda cool. But I just didnt like the movie. I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well. Or obviously. This was better than the other [[ASIN:B00005U8EM Groundhog Day]] in how it was maybe an hour shorter. Not for me. And I usually like off beat movies. Just dont be off beat for the sake of being offbeat. I think I might check out the soundtrack though.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  I've seen both versions and although it's almost impossible to out do Audrey Hepburn or William Holden, this version came very close.  However, I did like Harrison Ford's portrayal of the eldest Larrabee brother better than the original.  Humphrey Bogart was much too old for the part.  Harrison Ford was no spring chicken in this version, but he was much more appealing and I could see Sabrina falling for him instead of David.  This movie was fun and romantic.  Julia Ormond and Greg Kinnear had large shoes to fill and they did a wonderful job.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I liked the random life points that everyone seemed to be at. All four actors were about the same age, wanting the same thing, but they got there in different ways. Cameron Diaz plays a successful woman who switches homes with Kate Winslet, who works with her ex at The Telegraph, after they both get burned by love. Love-arity ensues when the two meet new people in their vacationing towns. A lot of the reviewers harp on how \\"predictable\\" the movie was. So? It's a love story. I mean, that would kind of suck if Kate Winslet and Jack Black made a love suicide pact wouldn't it? I personally thought the packed a surprise or two. I absolutely ADORED Kate Winslet. One of my dislikes of the movie had to be Cameron Diaz trying to overcome her ability to cry. It's uncomfortable to watch because she is such a bad actress during that part.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I have to be honest, I've never really listened to John Legend's music before, but he performed a beautiful song on Bill Maher's show \\"Real Time\\" and then a different song on Ellen.  I loved both! Since there were two songs off the same album that I really liked, I thought there would probably be several more, and there were.  It's a wonderful collection of music and I'm so glad I bought this CD.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I am not a fan of Abba, but my girlfriend is so I went with her to see the movie...I enjoyed it in spite of myself. Who knew Meryl Steep could sing with such depth and gusto? As soon as I saw the singalong version advertised, I went back for more!
B001DTPZNY|3.0|This was a decent effort to revive the Indie legacy but it left me wanting. What you ask? I'm not entirely sure.  Maybe it was that Ford was not as full of energy or wonder as he seemed in the previous offerings.  The movie is well worth watching but unless you own the first three installments and want to complete the set, rent it.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|The first two X-Men movies were short but really great. The Last Stand unfortunately doesn't live up to the other two, but it's worth watching for those who want to see how it ends. (SPOILER WARNING) It's a pretty good movie but the whole story is based off of shaky foundations and very far-fetched ideas. Jean comes back from the dead because apparently her powers formed a cocoon of some sort. She kills  Cyclops and Xavier (sad moment) and is then convinced my Magneto to help him take over the world. She was DEAD! And now we're supposed to believe her powers are the most dangerous of any ever discovered? Uh... ok.<br /><br />To keep it simple, The Last Stand mainly suffers from an 'out there' storyline. Otherwise the movie is good with spectacular special effects, an excellent music score, and some more great acting. If you liked the first two films you should watch this, if not then don't bother, because you'll only like it less.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I was a little embarrassed by that. But not so embarrassed that it stopped me from doing it again...
B00005N5S5|5.0|In the year 2029, machines rule the world. A few small bands of humans (survivors of the nuclear war between man and machine), under the lead of a man named John Connor, fight these artificially-intelligent monsters. Finally, the humans emerge victorious, and the machines are virtually defeated. But the machines have another plan. They will destroy John Connor by killing his mother, Sarah Connor,  before she gives birth to her son. They send through time the TERMINATOR, a cybernetic organism (flesh-covered robot), back to the year 1984. It will stop at nothing, until its mission -- to kill Sarah Connor -- is completed.       In this science fiction phenomenon of a film, we see screenwriter/director James Cameron at his best. For over two decades, this movie has held its iconic position as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. He tells a story of the future, but gives a feeling of legend, of a struggle of incomprehensible proportions, a dark story that seems like there is no possibility of victory. But Cameron does not leave us in utter depression, but always leaves a glimmer of hope. Throughout the film, we are treated to Brad Fiedel's perfectly-matched soundtrack, including one of the greatest pieces of modern movie music ever recorded --- the haunting TERMINATOR theme.       This is a movie that is highly recommended, to both sci-fi fans and non-sci-fi fans. It supersedes those bounds, and falls into a class all its own.    Ryan Robledo,  author of the [[ASIN:1425160735 Aelnathan:]]
0545128285|3.0|While 100 pages, the margins are huge, and the text is double spaced. Should take anyone with descent reading abilities 20 minutes at the most.    That said, for such a short book, it isn't bad. Enjoyable, but too short.
B0000AMRJD|1.0|If you could give this less than one stars, I would. I ordered the item, waited, sent an email, got some lame excuse as to why it hadn't come, wrote again, got some weird email saying it the vendor was unavailable. But throughout all this I never received the item. I finally had to cancel the credit card purchase. Whatever you do don't purchase anything from this vendor unless you like to throw money out the window. You would be better off burning your money at least you would get the benefit of the heat. I am not the first person to have this experience, I should have read the reviews first. I am just angry that Amazon has continued to keep this vendor on their website.
B000002QWD|5.0|Ahhh.... it's 1940 something, and there's the Bingsta in a recording studio not only having to re-record \\"White Christmas\\" but also laying down the other tracks included herein. He never conciously thought that the song was anything special. And, to him, this was just another project to loan that rich voice to. I am sure he had no idea that he'd do a duet with David Bowie many years later. But, that is the magic of life people.<br /><br />Speaking of magic, here it is. The all-time CLASSIC Christmas album. How did this come to be? Well, a number of good reasons. I am certain the melancholy and heartfelt vocal of the title song had something to do with it. But, upon closer examination you will hear the ballads and classic hymns of Christmas done with reverence and class and, yes, even with that late 1940's orchestra leading the way.<br /><br />This is a pure example of how a recording can be totally synonymous with a holiday. In fact, I have a belief that every family in America in the 50's owned a copy of this. The reason why I love it is because of the diversity here. You can go from a dirge like \\"Faith of Our Fathers\\" to the tender \\"Silent Night\\" and then to kicking it in with the groove of \\"Jingle Bells\\" (with the great Andrew Sisters). Not only that, but he made fairly unknown songs part of the landscape of American music. Namely, \\"Christmas in Killarney\\" and \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\", (Why do I always think of Chevy Chase with that song?).<br /><br />This is a testimony to earlier, simple times, when no digital technology existed and things were more pure. And we are the lucky ones for still having it with us. It's hard to believe it's been around for 60 years. Some may even feel like it's been around forever. But, if you get this and listen to it each year, it will seem like yesterday. You carry it in your soul always (but mainly in your heart).<br /><br />There is nothing better than listening to this in season, watching the snow storm outside, propping up you feet next to the warm embers, and having a sip or two of fine brandy. It's what I do best, after all.<br />Nevermind that, this selection is a very high choice in your collection if you don't have it. This is the CLASSIC of all CLASSIC Christmas albums.<br />Get it now or else risk me showing up in your house Christmas Eve with a band of snifting brandy rebel rousers. Get the picture?<br /><br />Metamorpho the red-nosed Seerbeer......ving a sip or two of fine brandy. It's what I do best, after all.   Nevermind that, this selection is a very high choice in your collection if you don't have it. This is the CLASSIC of all CLASSIC Christmas albums.  Get it now or else risk me showing up in your house Christmas Eve with a band of snifting brandy rebel rousers. Get the picture?    Metamorpho the red-nosed Seerbeer......
B000ATQYT2|2.0|Not happy at all that they removed the song, \\"When Love is Gone.\\"  That's one of the BEST songs in the movie and it makes no sense to remove it.  Especially because \\"When Love is Found\\" is at the end as a reprise - but no one hears the original song, where the melody comes from!  If Scrooge doesn't lose his love with a song, why find it with one??  Best to find this movie on VHS...clearly the better version.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|I'm surprised at the number of poor reviews for this film.  I have to admit that I picked it up with limited expectations, but once into it, I found it to be a bloody, irresistible ride---for what it is, that is.<br /><br />This film was spectacular in Blu-ray, appearing almost 3-D, at times. The CGI and audio were equally adrenaline pumping and, although I'm not usually into blood-fest, action films, this one became addictive.<br /><br />Yeah, the plot was limited, but I found a great deal of enjoyment watching James McAvoy morph from a passive, introverted, office cube-jockey, into a man. One who learned to stop saying, 'I'm sorry,' for just about everything. I did find myself mentally repeating, 'wax on, wax off,' during some of his lethality training, with difficulty taking his transformation seriously :-).<br /><br />Morgan Freeman has been a great addition to so many films, but he often tends to come across with the same acting formula. His abilities were stretched, with this atypical character.  Amazingly, he can actually be a convincing 'bad guy.' Who knew!<br /><br />Angelina Jolie's role was a piece-of-cake for her.  She rarely had any dialogue.  She was basically eye-candy, for the guys.  But, her sultry, sexy, witchy-eyed attributes were perfect for this killing-machine, character. Hmm, I'm scared of her!  And, she does angst SO well with those pouty lips, doesn't she.<br /><br />So, if you view this movie with casual expectations and are willing to allow yourself the enjoyment of pure escapism and bloody mayhem, I think you will enjoy this movie.  Just don't have too many espressos before watching.  You could develop a cardiac arrhythmia :-).
B000JVT1U0|4.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />Not a supernatural horror movie by any means, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is instead a creepy, eldritch crime thriller about a priggish Scottish policeman's attempt to rescue a missing girl from an island run by paganists.  This morally hidebound cop can't believe what he comes up against when he meets a smirking Christopher Lee sporting a ridiculous fright wig and his grinning pagan acolytes.  A staunch believer in Christ, a righteous man, the cop can't believe he can be destroyed by a gang of giggling pagans of all people.<br /><br />Always smiling and reveling, the giddy paganists also enjoy dancing in the nude, which shocks the uptight cop as well, but their frivolity masks a deeply sinister streak, a streak dripping with menace.  These rejects from the sixties' hippie movement turn out to be nine parts Manson family members and only one part flower childeren.<br /><br />The final scene with the wicker man near the beach at sunset is as shocking and weird as all get-out as well as a visual humdinger.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Fete of Death\\"
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is a wonderful CD - I received it 2 days before I saw Coldplay in concert. I was so glad I was familiar with  the songs they sang from this CD - it made the concert even better!
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. It's a bit different, as you will notice in the start, and really had me glued to the screen. The cast is excellent and delivers. I thought the special effects were good and not too over the top (remember, Crouching Tiger?). They pulled them off awesomely. I was actually impressed by the twist at the end, and did not expect it at all, especially from such a seemingly \\"pure aciton\\" film.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|My daughter wanted this for Christmas, but it was so expensive I shopped on Amazon for a better price.  I was a little nervous buying from a different seller thru Amazon, but service was great.  I was very relieved that when the DVD's arrived the box was exactly the same as the expensive ones I had seen in retail stores - I was afraid for such a low price I would get something different.  She won't open it until Christmas so I trust everything inside the pink box is there and in good working condition (received with the cellophane still on).  So I am very relieved and happy.
0446618306|5.0|This was my first book I have read from Sparks. And I loved it! I am now looking for all of them at used book stores!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|I'm a Bruce Willis fan and unashamed about it.  I've enjoyed looking at his performances ever since he first tussled with Cybil Shepard in MOONLIGHTING.  Seen all his movies, even that goofy musical he did with (of all people Joe Mantegna.  Talk about self-indulgent!  But so what.  Self-depreciating's more like it.  And don't you remember when, a few  years ago, some movement hag pretending to be a movie critic objected to his masculine \\"smirk.\\"  His reply?  I paraphrase:  \\"Sorry, lady.  That's the way I look.\\"  Truly, the man.    All right, his career's had its ups and downs.  Fortunately, along came Tarrentino with the role of a lifetime of the Punchy boxer with more luck than sense, and Willis found his 'type;' that is, the type he could play, more or less safely, for the next decade or so, that of the bruised and battered old cop.  It's his NYPD persona.  And granted its played as well by Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler in the LAW & ORDER Franchise, Special, etc.  And Meloni is good at it, no doubt.  But Willis who began on the small screen, is now the certified big screen star.  Anyway, here he is in a hi-budget action flick of first rank, with just enough plot to justify its baroque violence, and length.  (It's about one six-pak in length.)    This is, for want of a better word, a Cyber-Punk adventure flick with MATRIX overtones and style elements.  But tht's mostly greenish-blackish lighting in the opening segments, and a few 'quotes' from MATRIX, like the hollow knock on the hacker's door at night.  But, whereas MATRIX took place mostly in the invisible land behind computer-generated appearances (the MAT RIX itself of Reality) DIE HARD doesn't do that.  It's superficial in that it sticks with the realit y around (ourselves) and all the characters, and works within it to solve a magnificent computer hold-up scheme, organized and manipulated by a super-clever A-hole Hacker and his Eurasian Kung-Fu Killer chick.  Only mentioning this because if  you haven't seen it, you shouldn't be scared off by anything in the plot.  It' all plausible.   Nothing spooky or hokey.    Early on, Willis establishes himself as the \\"dad\\" of the story; that's the character he plays in t his series: a harried, worried scarred and petulent NYPD cop, divorced and living out of his squad car, who has an attractive but bitchy Mall Rat daughter who is anxious to test her sexual mettle.  He spends time stalking her and scaring off her would-be boy-friends.  One night, while he's doing same, he's instructed to find and 'bring in' a very important hacker (Justin Long).  He obeys orders and finds the pale-faced, black-haired keyboard junkie in his electronically-cluttered loft.  What neither he nor the kid now is that simultaneously there's a couple of pro assassin-types set to snuff the kid.  They attack and the action begins.  And, its well done, and followed by a number of other scens of differing type and increasing complexity which are in and of themselves, well done to say the least.      Long plays the young hacker as an immature but fundamen tally decent kid; smart, but insecure.  As Willis/McLane drags him from city to city and crisis to crisis, the kid though reluctant, goes from scarcely bearable to acceptable, and they form a kind of bond.  And then i becomes a BATMAN & ROBIN (or buddy) movie, but without tights, capes and super gadgets.  We've seen it before: sometimes as a War movie in which a callow kid learns how to be a man on the battlefield under the tutelage of a seasoned warrior.  Here it works out fine.  Neither soupy or kitch.    The first great action scene is a kind of ballet of crashing cars that takes place in a traffic tunnel under mid-town DC, where McL and the Kid -- who are being chased and shot at from above by a helicopter -- find temporary helter.  Basically two stunts, but awsome!    The next great action sequence takes place in a kind of Fed-Opeated/owned Computer Info Storage facility.  Too complex to explain.  Big.  Multi-stories and filled with metal stairways, elevator shafts and conduits, ducts and cables.  Perfect set for a lot of fast and dangerous action that terminates in a final stunt in an SUV hanging by a cable in an elevator shaft.  There's Miss Siagon in a TRINITY latex outfit -- stilletos and pistols -- who's trying very hard to kill McLane.  The escape reminds one of the escap from the lab truck hanging over he edge of the cliff in JURASSIC PARK.  Beautiful action sequence.  Double Wheu!!    And then, toward the end, Willis out-does (or tries to) Arnold S when he jumps on a low-flying jet fighter and...  Well, you have to see it for yourself.  It may not be believable, but it sure is while you watch.    Not going to give anything away.  Only say this: its a very interesting multi-ethnic-looking movie, with lots of new or at least unfamiliar actors with very interesting faces.  The location work is very realistic indeed, and the automobile crash ballet is fast, original and so dangerous looking  you wonder the actors dared to appear in the scenes.      What more can one say?  Everything is not Kirkegaaard and High Math.  Sometimes you've got to loosen your belt and let yourself have some fun.  This is as much fun as a good football game.  Or (for me) maybe more.    Best dialogue exchange in the movie?    QUESTION:  \\"You gonna threaten me in my own house?\\"  RESPONSE:   \\"You're gonna tell me what I need to know or I'm gonna beat you to death in your own house.\\"
0545128285|3.0|I am utterly disappointed by this small book. The five tales are definitely simple, if not simple-minded, and far from what could be thought about and expected from modern tales, or even tales in the tradition of thousands of years of story telling in the whole humanity. The author avoided the plain rewriting of tales, except the last one, the story of the three brothers, that is obvious, but that's just the point I would like to make: apparently traditional tales, all over the world, contain some simple structural elements that seem to be universal in story telling, part of a universal creative mind, and J.L. Rowling misses that point completely because her tales seem to be out of line of anything at all. And I have to admit these tales have little logic. Babbitty Rabbitty is based on the fact that witches can't do anything against a bunch of dogs, and at the same time one old witch alone can evade both detection and then the dogs when finally detected. And I won't speak of the poor youngest brother who lived all his life under Death's invisibility cloak: he must not have taken a shower very often. The Warlock story is absolutely gross and even terrible in the etymological meaning: it definitely evokes terror, it definitely terrifies people, or maybe only horrifies them. It sounds like some old Christian martyrdom tale. And the worst and most irritating part is the fact that J.K. Rowling adds Dumbledore's commentary and notes after each tale, as if the modern audience could not think all by itself, as if we were looking for a pedagogical text-book. In other words, J.K. Rowling could have been better inspired.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

0061142026|5.0|Read this a while ago, and the story is still fresh in my mind  Every time I read it, I have such a  a great visit to the town of Wall and behind the wall. There is magic in this story. I have yet to find a Neil GAiman book I dislike- and his style is so varied.  I actually am a fan of the movie as well, and followed Gaiman's adventures in script writing and movie making from his blog.
0316067601|5.0|Every time we do flutter kicks in my exercise class I think of this book.<br /><br />I think the most important piece of information that I brought way from Lone Survivor was the true difference of our cultures.  I really don't know many towns that would be willing to fight to the last person to protect someone.<br /><br />I've recommeded this book personally to several people.  It does contain a lot of pro-Texas, pro-Bush language (definately a proud Texan) but the meat of the story is very powerful.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" lives up to the hype. It's a killer movie. Great acting, great storyline. People who gave this one a bad review are out of their minds. They don't understand how brilliant this movie really is. Truly one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen on film. \\"Iron Man\\" was great, but it wasn't brilliant. This film is one of the best movies I've seen in years.<br /><br />I do want to talk about how lame the second disc is like everybody else has mentioned. I mean you're just better off buying the single disc version, but I'm not complaining I only paid $3.20 for the 2-disc special edition.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie all I have to say is where have you been? Get onboard with one of the best movies in years.
B001L4NJIO|1.0|Bought this from Best Buy and open it up and discover the cheapest packaging I've ever encountered.  Cheap @$$ plastic trays that are only partially glued to the fold-out paper 'digipak' that screams \\"what an idiot I am to buy this for over 30 dollars.\\"  CDs were loose of course and scratched a bit even before opening it up.  Avoid this at all cost!

031606792X|5.0|Again Stephenie Meyers is an excellent writer, very kind to her chracters I must add. Twilight was my favorite because it was more about falling in love and when the movie came out it was put to life, the cast of Edward and Bella fit so perfectly, the chemistry was definately there. As I started the second book New moon, it was more about losing and choosing love I guess I hated the fact that there was hardly no Edward in the picture...and with the movie coming out soon..well it would be a bore if he wasnt in it much..dont you think?  I guess Jacob's not my favorite he is just to young and too wrong for the part..reading the 3 books after twilight kinda made it annoying having him in the picture soo much..again I'm sure the author had a reason. But for the movie I hope they add Edward in more he's better to look at..    Breaking dawn a happy ending
0385340990|5.0|A splendid read about a little-known subject, the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII.  I recall either it or something similiar as the subject of a BBC series - the book was better.
B000002LRX|5.0|At the risk of sounding like an over-hyped fanboy, this is flat out the best album of the 90s in my opinion - and perhaps beyond. It is such a shame, on one hand, they don't get more recognition in the mainstream for the sheer brilliance that is included here ... but the people in the know, know how great they were.    Can't really say much others haven't said, so just wanted to chime in with a \\"me too.\\" ... There is so much going on in each of the songs, and all so diverse, you really need to put the headphones on, sink your teeth in, and listen. Each instrument brings something to the table in a great way -- and I count Patton's vocals as an \\"instrument,\\" since most of the time you have no idea what he's saying, but it sounds amazing (then read the lyrics to see how amazing those are too). ... What really makes the tone, however, in my opinion, is the keyboard. You don't usually want to say that about a rock record, but it really works for Faith No More - and gives everything a creepy, fascinating tone.    This is my desert island disc, along with Alice In Chains and Led Zeppelin.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I have been a complete Enya fan since I heard her music being played at the Bay Theatre in San Francisco as we were waiting for the movie, \\"Prince of Tides\\" to start. I was so overwhelmed by what I heard that I had to go to the lobby to inquire about the CD being played.....and, as soon as the movie ended, I went to Tower Records and bought the CD.  Her music gives me such a calming, wonderful spiritual feeling...and this latest presentation has those same qualities.  If this is what you are looking for....you will not be disappointed if you purchase the CD......
B0009S2T0M|2.0|It is a solid mystery with a stellar cast and excellent acting, but I just couldn't warm up to the underlying theme of visceral violence, self-mutilation, and, most disturbing of all, incest. If you are open to controversial topics, then I'd recommend this movie. If not, this may leave bad taste in your mouth.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|I hadn't been familiar with Diana Krall when my sister gave me this CD.  It turns out she's a jazz singer and pianist.  On this album she sings and plays familiar Christmas songs.  I don't know enough about jazz to get into any serious analysis of the music on this CD, but it sounds pretty good to me.  Miss Krall has a very nice voice and she knows how to tickle the ivories, too.  If you're looking for a jazzy Christmas album, this should do the trick.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|I don't agree with some of the reviews here.  I think the \\"screaming guy\\" on Seven Lives is absolutely awesome!  I am glad they mixed it up a little bit.  That song especially is the best one on the album.  I love the whole album and I'm glad they don't keep trying to do the same thing over and over again.  Love, Sensuality and Devotion is still the best album ever but this is close.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Whenever a bona fide rock god supergroup releases a new album, there is always a sense of anticipation wondering whether or not this will be the release that is their fall from grace and into a cast into the bargain bin two weeks after release. Coming back to the charts with their sixth studio album, Nickelback have again proven their deserving of acclaim and the millions of fans world wide.<br /><br />The album rings true to the well known sound that forced the band into the international spotlight back in 2002 with their album Silver Side Up. Since then, the band has gone from strength to strength with several world tours and another three subsequent albums, Nickelback have become a household name the world over with their unique blend of power ballad and enthralling rock legend sounds. This time they have teamed up with legendary producer John \\"Mutt\\" Lang who has worked with acts like Shania Twain, Bryan Adams and AC/DC. The collaboration is astounding and benefits both parties credentials.<br /><br />Dark Horse is no exemption to the bands well deserved accolades. The Rolling Stones magazine gives it 4.5 stars out of 5. The New York Times and Billboard both say that it's worthy of its predecessor which sold 8 million copies to a society that doesn't pay for CDs. Nickelback is known for their no holds barred lyrics which tell a story each and every time and all reviews agree that the band has again, stuck to form.<br /><br />On Dark Horse the stories keep coming and each one grabs you by the ear and makes you listen. Just To Get High  is the hottest song on the album and tells the horror story of a best friend who becomes chemically dependant. Stooping to selling his mother's jewelry and pulling a knife on a woman passing by. The song screams of the helpless feeling of not being able to help and being a bystander while this self destructive cycle rolls around.<br /><br />As with all their other albums, there is a verbose amount of sexual innuendo all the way through all the lyrics present on the album. On the song Shakin' Hands they comment on a high society escort who, as they say, earns six figures working three days a week. Whether it's a comment on the state of the way Hollywood works or something more sinister is never clarified. There is a comment that she does it to get ahead in L.A. though, so anything is possible.<br /><br />Rounding out the album is the happy feel good song This Afternoon which talks about the end of the day. What they did, what they'll do and is a quiet reflection on all the things positive in their lives. It's a stark contrast to the rest of the work on the album which has a strong, blunt trauma feel to it. The light guitar plucking and background noise that sounds like a bar in the early evening with people happily chatting after work all make the song joyous and enticing to listen to.<br /><br />Nickelback are bona fide rock gods. Their albums sell by the millions worldwide, their tours sell out and they release solid pieces of work one after the other. This is the rock band that does no wrong, does not hold anything back. They're blunt, they're crass and they're not always genteel. They are the penultimate rock group.e album.

0375826726|1.0|The first 2 books i thoroughly enjoyed... but this one... It can't even be called part of the same series. the writing styles, characters behaviors, and the general plot. are completely different. suddenly in the 3rd(what was supposed to be the last book) the dragons minds have a man-with-long-straw-hair way of identifying people, arya is almost a bit part now and acts completely different.       none of the new plot twists were imaginative or the magic even remotely to the same caliber. I think the dumbest part was his new sword. space metal that the elves cannot forge just happens to be under a tree that saphira burns to make it talk to them. and of course there is the whole 'no eragon I am your father'      It was just bad. maybe it wouldn't be so bad by itself, but to extend the inheritance trilogy or whatever it is now with this, just ruined the story. he should have saved new ideas he had for a new series, not try to change everything in the middle of one.      obviously i will still get the last one when it comes out because i kinda have to to know how he finishes it. but the inheritance trilogy stopped with eldest.
6305508550|5.0|Maybe it's because I hate my job, but I think this is the most hysterical movie I have ever seen.  I watch it when I've had a \\"bad day at the office\\" and it cheers me up every time!  Maybe because most companies are alike no matter what their business, I would really recommend this to anyone who can relate at all to work related stress, not just to people who work in cubicles in an office.  After all, the rest of the workforce have jerks for bosses, companies that can't get their policies and procedures down, don't know how to communicate and think the morale in their staff is great when it's really in the toilet!  Additionally, I would recommend this to anyone who just likes a good comedy.  I use clips from this movie in training courses I provide at work, about what NOT to do to your employees and I recommend this movie to all my friends and co-workers as therapy for when they are taking an I'm \\"sick\\" of my job day off.  I also love that now that it's older the price is right and you can give it as a gift to work related friends.  If you haven't seen it, skip renting and just buy it, you will not be dissappointed.
B001EYGOG0|4.0|What a pleasant and unexpected surprise this warm and wonderful CD is.  At an age when most singers would either be retired or repeating themselves, Tony Bennett sounds invigorated and totally relevant.  And brother, does he do these songs justice!  Bennett has never had the strongest pop voice around and his range is somewhat limited, yet he possesses the most musical instrument of his or any generation.  Pitch perfect, with tone and intonation to spare, his phrasing is immpecably fluid and expressive with none of the overwrought mannerisms many pop stylists develop over time.  On \\"A Swinging Christmas\\", he displays his remarkable interpretive powers again and again.  \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" swings with a strong relaxed style, while both \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" bounce with a jazzy flavor that Bennett takes full advantage of.  He offers nice, smoky takes on \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" that expand but don't detract from more traditional versions, and he practically reinvents \\"Silver Bells\\" with a smooth jazz groove.  While \\"My Favorite Things\\" is coy in any version and \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" is by now an overdone standard, Bennett still makes the most of them and never falters, even with such overripe material.  His duet with daughter Antonia, who is not burdened with her father's talent, is still a delightful addition here.  This terrific if somewhat obscure Irving Berlin song is a perfect fit for Bennett's mastery and it's great to have another chance to hear such a grand old chestnut.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Swinging Christmas\\", the Count Basie Orchestra makes it known why they are one of the greatest ever, and their musicianly sounds create the perfect bed for that voice.  Still, the bottom line is that Tony Bennett sounds decades younger than his 80+ years and continues his career long tradition of knowing exactly what to do with his voice, and then doing it to perfection.No stylized sentimentality here...just a smart, no nonsense, precise and straightforward lesson in what makes a song a song, and a great singer a great singer.  A swinging Christmas indeed.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Of the 13 pieces on this CD, 5 appeared on the earlier, very brief CD \\"A Winter Garden.\\"  Didn't matter.  I wanted it anyhow.  If you're a Loreena McKennett fan, you will love this CD, and you won't care any more than I do that 5 of the 13 appeared before.  It has the middle east, \\"caravan\\" sound common to much of her music, and that certainly brings new life to old pieces.  I think it's great.
1416562605|3.0|A commendable first offering from Mr. Adiga -- rich in imaginative scope, character realization and narrative momentum. Certainly more than just another \\"angry young man\\" tirade against systemic Indian corruption. However, the angle that is used to launch the novel as an open letter to the Premier of China falls apart as a weak gimmick since it fails to develop a theme uniting Indian corruption with anything really Chinese at it's core. An overly cynical view of Indian progress is at the root of the novel, though, and that to me is a substantive miss of the country's recent attitudinal shifts. The strongest feature is the story telling fluency, with a first-rate protagonist plucked from the gutters of India.
0307383415|5.0|This most fascinating and revealing book, along with \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" should be required reading for every high school student in this country.  Indeed, anyone who cares to understand the hopes and aspirations of our President-elect, based on where he comes from, what he has gone through, and how he thinks should read these books.  They read like novels; they are more exciting than fiction.  Hard to put down.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Enjoyed the movie the first time I bought it, and the extras make it even better.
0375826726|3.0|I must admit overall I did enjoy the book and I really liked the cover. However on the negative side, certain sections did feel slightly padded to me and maybe I'm being pedantic but the chapters where Saphira was thinking/conversing with herself I found irritating. Why, when Saphira thinks to herself does she uses simplistic language i.e. The big round fire in the sky (sun), men-who-were-friends (Varden), but when she talks to anyone else she is able to speak normal English?    Otherwise this is still one of the better current fantasy series around.
0307455874|5.0|This is the first book of this type that I have read and I surprised myself by enjoying it. Before reading it I thought it would be full of the usual impossible promises politicans make but Obama is very down to earth. Bits I didnt like included a lot of names those unfamiliar with US politics will not know, and the occasional bias towards the USA over other nations. As a book it is well written, structured, funny on occasion and a good intro to modern American politics.
B00000K44W|5.0|Aqualung should be everyone's first Tull cd. After that, high on the list is Thick as a Brick, Songs From the Wood, Stand Up, Benefit, the Christmas album, and Living in the Past. Ian Anderson's Secret Language of Birds is also essential.   Heavy Horses is a great album, with several songs that are capable of becoming favorites, and which strangely, do not appear on many \\"best of\\" Tull compilations. Acres Wild is great. Moths, Journeyman, the Rover and One Brown mouse are great as well. You can always expect moments of genius on every  Tull album, that's why I have them all. Although some Tull albums, I don't play very much, but very often, some albums will sneak up on you and grow on you like this one, as long as they are given a good listen.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|I've been impressed with their 2 other discs and couldn't wait for this one to arrive.  When I first popped it in, I could really sink my teeth into the rockers, but was a little put off with it having many numbers at slow or mid-tempo.      After about 5 more spins, all the songs started to really grow on me.  Now, I'm enjoying them all.  The vocals sound great and strongly carry the melodies.  This is a great rock band.  The hard tunes are in your face and the slower tunes become infectious.  This is the next best rock release since a guy named Sebastian Bach released ANGEL DOWN last year...only Bach's is more in your face metal.    It is a shame they didn't include the songs \\"Junkies for Fame\\" and \\"Own You\\" with the regular release.  Both are standard rock tunes, just done a lot better than what the other bands can do.  I think Itunes...maybe even Amazon will allow you to download them.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Bought this many years ago in the form of an LP. It was practically a life changing event.   Songs From the Wood is one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time. Yours is no Disgrace, Frankenstein, Riders on the Storm, and Third Stone From the Sun are other classics that rank about as highly. It is so complex, and so well done that it boggles the mind. The same joy of nature carries through the rest of the album with songs like Jack in the Green, Cup of Wonder, and Velvet Green. This version of \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" is probably better than the one on the Christmas Album. The feel of the album is like celebrating in an old pub maybe in the late 18th century.   Jethro Tull is as unique and visionary a group as there ever was, and this is a landmark album for them. Ian Anderson is like some pied piper or a mythological pan leading you into different realms of the mind. Be careful, you might become addicted like me and buy all their other albums.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Yes, this concert DVD is really good. Its a good song selection and excellent performances. My only complaint is the camera work during the drum solo. During the drum solo, they have too much footage from the back of the arena.   When I buy a RUSH concert video, 95% of the reason I'm buying it is to see the drum solo (up close). Unfortunately whoever was selecting the camera angles decided to use too many distance shots. Kind of stupid.  They might as well have aimed the camera at the floor and filmed that instead. It would have been about as interesting.   Don't get me wrong, not all the camera angles are that bad. Just the ones from the back of the house.  All  in all, its a great concert and as another review said, the bonus features are pretty funny.

B001DXS4E2|5.0|The first time I saw \\"Holiday Inn\\" was in the early 60's when I was just 7 years old. I just LOVED the music and movie.Its been a tradition for my Sister and me to look at this film every year during CHRISTmas.  Now,it feels like I'm seeing \\"Holiday Inn\\" for the first time in color.I can't believe how different everything looks.The colors of the ballons and actors clothes when Bing Crosby and Marjore Reynolds sing \\"Happy Holidays\\" is unreal,and the 4th of July number with Fred Astaire and the firecrackers was fantastic.  This box set still has the original black and white DVD,and you get a CD of the music.If you are a fan of this great movie,your in for a real treat when you purchase this 3 disc collector's set ,and its under 20bucks at most stores.
B00004NHCC|5.0|I can't add anything to what the other reviewers have said. I can only toss in another 5-star review.
B001E7OO2I|1.0|Just a few words of warning - this new John Legend is really really awful - don't get me wrong, I did appreciate some of his earlier stuff and was hoping for at least two or three great tunes - how many here? Zero! The poppy stuff is so so, the rest is bloated and uninspired. Stay away!!!
B0015519VS|3.0|This CD wasn't what I  expected. Everyone has become aware that Usher once he takes a long break he comes back with an amazing album. However, this time around that wasn't the case. The album is not the usher I fell in love with. The songs are soo boring and dreadfull. I dowloaded the whole album into my ipod an the same week I remove all the songs. I just don't like the new Usher.
B00016POFE|3.0|If you're an \\"old school\\" stereo system owner like me as in left and right channels this album with DTS is not for you. All this disc is recorded as a very clear and clean mono sound with instruments mixed together sounding far and near. No instruments or voices are panned either left or right (recording freaks understand what I'm talking about), you will not hear drum rolls from one channel to the other nor the divisions of intruments or voices. This album is made for 5.1 systems if you don't care what it sounds like. If you don't have a \\"Decorder\\" in computer, than be prepared to get one if you want to listen to this album. It can also be challenging to play on a regular DVD player also. I bought the album because of the \\"Bonus Tracks\\" which are fantastic, but as far as recording mix it sucks. I have no clue what kind of drugs or what planet Steve Wilson is doing or is living in but it was a bad idea.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Since I purchased this item for a gift, I am just going on Amazon's reputation for excellence.  I have not been disappointed in anything I have purchsed from you.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|What an amazing alblum.  I was a little apprehensive at first, hearing that it was more of an electronic alblum, but wow, was I ever impressed.  The CD starts out with the hard rocking \\"Citizen of the Planet\\".  Set to middle eastern beats, and hard crunching fake guitars, this is the perfect opening song to the CD.  \\"Underneath\\", the first promotional single, is amazing.  A perfect, radio-friendly pop rock song about communication gaps in relationships, primarily about her and actor Ryan Reynolds.  If you missed Alanis Morissette's filthy mouth on her last couple of CD's, well, listen to song number 3, \\"Straightjacket\\".  Infused with a disco, dance feeling, it's a great song to listen to while you're getting ready to go out, or driving to the club.  \\"Versions of Violence\\" is a great song about fighting with your lover, and the long term affects that abuse can have after the fight is over.  \\"Moratorium\\" is among the best on this CD.  Listen carefully to the bridge in this song....\\"Aaah to breath/Stop looking outside/Stop searching in corners of rooms/Not my business or timing/Aaaah\\"....so beautiful, and haunting.  Very dark song.  \\"Torch\\" is by far the saddest song on this CD.  It is definately about her break up with Ryan Reynolds, and can totally bring a tear to your eye.  It's a wonderful ballad, and Alanis at her best.  \\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\" is another great dance/pop/rock song.  The song is about the start of a new beginning for Alanis after her breakup.  Listen over, and over to the triple harmonizing that Alanis does on the line \\"And I'm smiling for no reason\\"....you'll love it.  \\"Tapes\\" is very dark, and very emotional.  It deals with dealing with low self-esteem, and how depressing one can feel after a breakup. Alanis sang this song live during most of her North American tour, and it was mind blowing.  The last song, \\"Incomplete\\" ends the CD on a happy note with Alanis looking towards a bright future, and reassuring herself that things will be ok, almost a sequel to \\"That I Would Be Good\\" from \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", but with more of a upbeat rock feel to it.  With the bonus song, check out \\"Orchid\\", the hard rocking \\"Guy Who Leaves\\", \\"Madness\\", and the best \\"On the Tequila\\".  In my opinion, all these B-Side songs should have been on the actual CD.  They are all brilliant.  \\"On the Tequila\\" should have been released as a single, and if so, \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" would have been a multi-platnium seller.  I highly recommend this CD if you have ever been an Alanis fan.

B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|Good film but it is a shoe in for the prize of worst blu-ray transfer ever.    Total garbage picture quality. If you have the dvd you don't need this. Whoever was in charge of transfering this to blu-ray should never be allowed to do so again.    Colors are off, image detail is non existant and blacks are crushed to the point they have little to do with actually being black.
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|This Blu Ray is an a very good transfer taking into consideration the source and age of the film itself.  Fans of Halloween shouldn't hesitate to pick this up as this is clearly how Carpenter would have intended the movie to look...and that's not a bad thing here.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|For a movie with so little dialogue, the storytelling is amazingly articulate.  The soundtrack is spot on.  We have four children and saw this movie in the theater with the grandparents on opening weekend. At the end of the picture, everyone applauded while wiping their eyes.  We now own the dvd, my autistic son sees this movie on a daily basis, which I love because this movie has such marvelous unspoken language that he understands.  The dvd also contains the mini-features with the magician, which was part of the theatrical release, and Burn-E which plays into the movie quite well.  The special features dvd is very extensive with the pictures and description of the robots, my kids love it.  Again Pixar did not disappoint with the visual wonderment, but still knows the meaning of excellent storytelling.
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|This is a wonderful movie by the artist Tarsem.  Lee Pace is amazing in the movie as well as the little girl playing opposite him.
B0012BQ36G|5.0|As I tell family and friends:  it's not an easy read at first, but you get used to the language.  And when you begin to understand what he's saying about the human condition and, in a nutshell, why we're so miserable and what we can do to end the suffering... it not only makes sense but it's a solution that's been THERE and INSIDE YOU all this time!  I've begun implimenting his teachings into my life (enjoying the \\"now\\" instead of being upset about the past, or worrying about the future) and I feel so at peace.  My children are happier, I don't fight with my husband nearly as much, TRAFFICE doesn't even bother me!  The other day... I made my own stomach ache go away when I started to get nurvous about being late.  I took a moment, remembered to enjoy that moment, and the pain stopped.  I felt calm, at ease... and I wasn't late after all.
B000WCBPOG|3.0|I loved this movie. I bought the soundtrack because I wanted to listen to the music from the movie. Guess I was due for a disappointment. This is the only soundtrack that I have ever bought where the music was of less quality than what was in the movie. My personal disappointment was \\"with a little help from my friends.\\"  On the soundtrack, only Max and Jude sang. Max and Jude sound great together, but I thought that the chorus from the movie really made that song rowdy like it should be rowdy. A couple of the songs were fragments in the movie and I was hoping for the complete versions. That was also not included. :(
B00005JKGK|4.0|If you have read the book, you will appreciate the fact that Amy Tan helped in writing the screenplay. The film is very true to the book with a few bits left out but the heart and spirit of the story was successfully captured in the film version. It probes deeply into the heart of the mother-daughter dynamic and, no matter where your roots are, where you are from or where you grew up, there is a common theme that I believe every woman can relate to which are those hopes and expectations that a mother has for her daughter. Sometimes these hopes and expectations are outside of what the daughter wants or perceives for herself but what is needed is understanding of each other to bridge the gap. This film is a profound story about women and their daughters who have bridged that gap, cultural and experiential, and the journey they went through to do so. Heart-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time. Beautifully done!    For the cinematography and the superb acting, this film deserves five stars and more. I did not give it five stars because it is such an emotional roller coaster ride that it is hard to watch - even though I have watched it several times! Joy Luck Club is a masterpiece of storytelling the way that a film should be!
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|So if you want to watch a movie with a tight story line, good plot and a very nice twisted end...watch this, you will not be sorry. It's full of action, sarcasm, fighting, chase scenes and keeps you guessing.
1416562605|2.0|Picked up the book after its Booker Prize and am deeply disappointed with the judges! Finished the book in one sitting.. There was not much there.. The main character, Balram Halvai's voice lacks authenticity. I have seen many Balram's (some from Heart of \\"Darkness\\" - Bihar) and none came close to using the language and idiom that the book uses.     The author falls into the trap of making Balram \\"exotic\\" and misses a great opportunity to capture the changing India. The novel is weakest when describing Laxmangarh in \\"Darkness\\" (Read Pankaj Mishra for more accurate description of \\"Darkness\\"), calling to question if the author ever stepped into \\"Darkness\\" or just relied on descriptions of \\"Darkness\\" from periodicals!    Novel's premise, in the hands of a more disciplined and subtle author, definitely had the potential for greatness (read Ellison or Dostoyevsky, for contrast!). Instead what we got was one pretentious and \\"well marketed\\" (playing up the \\"exotic Indian\\" stereotypes) novel. Only thing missing is a scene of \\"An Arranged Marriage\\" with dowry!    Comparisons to Ellison's \\"Invisible Man\\" and to Dostoyevsky are far fetched. Doubt if anyone will remember this book in 5 years!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This review is prompted by a recent two-star review complaining that Fawlty Towers is \\"simply\\" a farce, is not thought-provoking, and is merely a solo vehicle for John Cleese as opposed to, per that reviewer, Monty Python movies.    To each his own, I guess.    This is far from a solo Cleese show. Each of the regulars is a unique, fully realized character. It is the interplay between these characters (with each other and with Cleese) that makes the show. Compare it to some other comedy shows that have a \\"star\\" comedian as a lead. For example, Mork and Mindy. That is an example of a \\"solo\\" effort and is quite the opposite of Fawlty Towers. You don't see any of the characters in FT standing around laughing at some Cleese antic and looking like they forgot their lines or missed their cue. In FT all the actors stay in character and are generally essential to the scene they are in.    It is agreed that this is not the place if you are looking for something \\"genuinely thought-provoking\\" (as that other reviewer wished for). But then again, neither are any of the Monty Python movies (despite that other reviewer's belief). So yes, FT is a farce, but farce is an honorable art form. Just ask William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer, for starters.    Fawlty Towers is one of the funniest, most tightly-scripted shows ever on TV. Some of the episodes are right up there with _The Comedy of Errors_ and _The Miller's Tale_. And I think the target audience for all of these was about the same.
B00004RFFI|5.0|\\"Twister\\" is a film that I repeatedly enjoy.  I recently got a DVD to replace my videocassette.  Jan de Bont who became a star director with \\"Speed\\" & then faded with \\"Speed 2\\" & \\"The Haunting\\" does an excellent job piloting this project.  The film was nominated for Oscars for Best Sound & Best Visual Effects.  Bill Paxton who was creepy in [[ASIN:B00006AUJR Frailty]] plays Bill Harding who is trying to get his ex-wife to sign divorce papers.  Paxton may not have great depth; but in a film which hinges on visual effects, he does a good job.  He shows up with his fiancee Melissa who is a sex therapist.  Jami Gertz plays the character as a prissy, overly organized person who is out of place with these storm chasers.  Helen Hunt who won an Oscar for \\"As Good As It Gets\\" & a Golden Globe for TV's \\"Mad About You,\\" is the real star as Jo Harding.  Jo is driven by the childhood loss of her father to a tornado and researches to improve early warning capability.  She is emotionally still attached to Bill and finds it difficult to let go.  As the day of tornados gets underway, the interplay between the two sparks the film, similar to the great formula for [[ASIN:B000AP04FG Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)]] where Angelina Joli & Brad Pitt played spouses who argue throughout the action.<br /><br />Many of the smaller parts are well played despite the snippets of dialogue.  Lois Smith who was in [[ASIN:B0006TL806 P.S.]] & played Jack Nicholson's sister in \\"Five Easy Pieces\\" plays Aunt Meg who is always glad to see her niece and feed her crowd.  Alan Ruck who worked with de Bont on \\"Speed\\" and was recently in [[ASIN:B001DZOC6Y The Happening]] plays Rabbit who continually checks maps.  Gary Busey's son Jake plays a mobile lab technician.  Philip Seymour Hoffman who would later be nominated for an Oscar for \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\" and win one for \\"Capote\\" plays the rock blasting Dusty who talks to Melissa about \\"the suck zone.\\"  By the time the final frames arrive, we feel like we've been as close to a tornado as we are ever likely to want to get.  There are a few extras on the DVD scenes that give an appreciation for the lean cut de Bont made for the film.  In addition, Van Halen do a music video on what is also the excellent soundtrack [[ASIN:B000002N7W Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack]].  Enjoy!e been as close to a tornado as we are ever likely to want to get.  There are a few extras on the DVD scenes that give an appreciation for the lean cut de Bont made for the film.

0446677450|3.0|This book motivated me to get my finances in order and get on track to have a stable financial future. I was truly inspired to learn how to have my money make more of itself, as the books talks a lot about. However, a major word of caution: READ THIS BOOK AND STOP RIGHT THERE! I attended a free Rich Dad Poor Dad seminar that sold me a $495 3-day workshop for which I took two days off of work. During those 3 days, they tried, very convincingly to sell me a $25,000 Rich Dad Poor Dad package of workshops. I am ashamed to have been scammed out of $495 and would like the world to know that, while this is a great message, the Rich Dad Poor Dad franchise has gone too far, scamming and ripping off the financially uneducated public. Please take heed to this review.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|I have never seen a great movie than this.<br />The pace is great,the storyline is fantastic and it keeps u guessing till the end how it ever ends.<br /><br />Well Of course its Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.A* list actors with a cool sense.I am glad to have watched this on DVD.<br /><br />Its great.The picture us clear and perfect.The sound,5.1, makes you jump out of your seat.Somehow, whenever a Warner Bros dvd is released,it always has better sound and picture quality then other dvd producer(giving sony entertainment an exception).<br /><br />If you have yet to watch,this is highly recommended.Its a movie that is released once in a lifetime.
1563899426|5.0|I discovered this series a week ago, and almost finished all 11 plus the prequel. This is a wonderful start to a wonderful series. I was never much of a fan of Snow White until now. She is no longer the meak, mild woman from the Disney version. She is in charge of Fabletown... more or less. I love her and Bigy Wolf. There were a lot of funny quips. You do need to know who the fairy tale characters are and a bit of their story for this to be as funny as it is. I highly recommend this series to adults who loves fairytales. This series is definitely NOT for kids.
0375842209|5.0|The book came in excellent condition, hence the five-star rating;  however, it took over one month and it was apparently reported to have been shipped a month earlier.  This has never happened, and I have since ordered other products that made an arrival within one, one time two, weeks.
0517122707|5.0|This novel was written in 1969 and published posthumously by the author's mother in 1980 when it won a Pulitzer Prize. In it, Ignatius J. Reilly, the pathetic, slovenly 30-something, highly literate but socially inept momma's boy has run-ins with the law, loses job after job and fails with women, all the while expounding his down-his-nose view of the world. The ultimate loser. This book is SO funny I constantly laugh out loud (it's one of the few books I've EVER read more than once). But it's also sad. A true tragicomedy. And it still reads as fresh as if it were written in today's world. Sadly, this was Toole's only full-length novel. But what a masterpiece it is!    Not only is it funny as hell, but the dialogue is on the mark when it comes to New Orleans dialect. John Kennedy Toole had it down to a T.  One of my favorite passages follows.  It speaks of Santa Battaglia, aunt of Patrolman Mancuso, girlfriend of Ignatius J. Reilly's mother:    ---        Santa grabbed the picture on the mantelpiece, a photograph of an ancient and hostile-looking woman in a black dress and black stockings standing in a dark alley paved with oyster shells.        \\"Poor momma,\\" Santa said feelingly, giving the picture a loud, wet kiss. The grease on the glass that covered the photograph showed the frequency of these affectionate onslaughts. \\"You sure had it hard, kid.\\" The little black coals of Sicilian eyes glared almost animatedly at Santa from the snapshot. \\"The only picture of you I got, momma, and you standing in a alley. Ain't that a shame.\\"        Santa sighed at the unfairness of it all and slammed the picture down on the mantelpiece among the bowl of wax fruit and the bouquet of paper zinnias and the statue of the Virgin Mary and the figurine of the Infant of Prague. Then she went back to the kitchen to get some ice cubes and one of the kitchen chairs. After she had returned with the chair and a little picnic cooler of ice cubes, she arranged her best jelly glasses on the mantelpiece before her mother's picture. The proximity of the picture made her grab it and kiss it again, the ice cube in her mouth cracking against the glass.    --    See what I mean?    A Confederacy of Dunces is part slapstick, part tragedy, part philosophy, part soap opera, part crime novel, and part character sketch.    This particular edition [1996, Wings Books (hardcover)] contains a sensitive and elucidating foreword by famous Southern writer Walker Percy.  In it, he praises JKT both for his ability to put his finger on the pulse of New Orleans as well as for his character portrayal.  Mr. Percy also explains how the novel first fell into his hands and ultimately how it came to be published.

B001C08RHA|4.0|Bought this for my son (18).  He thoroughly enjoyed the action and technology.  I found the scenery to be a bit dark.  Overall, a pretty good movie for the price.
B001DHXT20|1.0|wow.. so rarely is a movie so bad that i have to stop the movie and take it out.. not since White Chicks... which now there are two movies that didnt deserve to finish spinning in the dvd player.<br /><br />The original tv show was more realistic.  Sorry just cant wait to take to the movie exchange store.<br /><br />I do wish i could get that hour of my life back but.. alas its gone.
B001FES0HU|4.0|Este disco es un claro ejemplo que no existe una relación proporcional entre calidad y volumen de ventas, además de dejar presente que los críticos musicales profesionales son unos ladrones de gallinas.    Las trece composiciones originales del disco van de lo bueno a lo sublime (destaco sobre todo Voodoo, We Believe y Warboys), siendo un trabajo que mezcla seriedad lírica con inmadurez irreverente (cosa que disfruto cada vez más al  creer cada vez menos en el contenido social de las letras de la mayoría de las bandas que componen el mainstream del negocio musical).    Que puedo decir que no se haya dicho de Roger Taylor y Brian May? Me limito a decir que creo que van a pasar muchos años antes de que se repita un tandem similar de tan notables cualidades, mientras que Paul Rodgers tiene una voz realmente de PUTA MADRE. Ese señor tiene un don vocal que hace ridículas las críticas recibidas en los últimos meses.    En definitiva, si tenés ganas de escuchar algo de primera (cosa que sale cada 25 millones de años), comprá este disco y hacé que la crítica se vaya a tomar por culo.    P.D. - No le puse 5 estrellas, porque se las dejo reservadas a los clásicos, con lo que me refiero a obras con por lo menos 5 años en plaza que han logrado pasar la barrera de la inmediatez.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|We saw the play in Vegas and we thought it was fun to watch and sing along to. The players were fantastic but it was live so the scenery was o.k. Well then we saw the movie . The scenery in the movie was at time breath taking. We thought the movie was so enjoyable we took friends to see it four more times. I never thought I would see 007. Meryl Streep was wonderful as well was the rest of the cast.  Buy it ,rent it no matter what you do you will enjoy the story and the ABBA  songs.     Dennis B. in Kentucky.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|Hard to understand how with all the talent involved this movie turned out so very so-so. I find it hard to point out exactly why I didn't like it that much. Crowe seems wasted in such a small, repetitive role (a first for him). DiCaprio is at it again cursing throughout the whole movie with another of his \\"I'm way past the Titanic-pretty-boy role\\". The exact moment you see an attractive girl turn up in the movie you realize he is going to fall in love with her and she is going to be threatened in some way by the bad guys. And then all the middle eastern names sound so very all the same to me, half the time I didn't know who or what they were talking about. Spending so much time in such rough unattractive places made me constantly wish for an intermission and that they would show commercials in theaters half-way through movies. I find it a miracle I didn't fall sleep watching BODY OF LIES. All of this is not to say this is a terrible movie. The satellite spying scenes are pretty good and you'll be wondering yet again how exactly it is they can't find the 9/11 terrorists with all this technology (you'd think they'd have to get out of the cave once in a while). Anyway, this ought to make a better DVD than theater going expirience.
0316017922|3.0|The book is interesting, but there isn't enough content to merit a book. Should have been a longish magazine article. It is also written in the service of Gladwell's personal bias, as I see it. He's half Jamaican, and half Jewish. Therefore, one of the most detailed chapters in the book is a seemingly endless discussion of how brave Jewish lawyers in New York triumphed over discrimination. We've heard this ten thousand times, and Gladwell actually manages to make incredibly wealthy, powerful men like Joseph Flom (a founding partner of Skadden Arps) seem like victims. The Epilogue is all about how on the Jamaican side of his ancestry -- guess what? Brave Jamaicans overcome discrimination!
0452289963|2.0|I enjoyed his last book more, The Power of Now. I don't think there was anything new here in his attempt to show us how to awaken our consciousness.  I agree with the other reviewer who said he appears to be going around in circles.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|For those of you who are fans of Let Go and Under My Skin please don't tarnish your good opinion of Avril by listening to this album because it's absolute garbage.  I can't listen to this without laughing- it really is that bad.  The only reason I gave it any stars at all are for the three tracks that easily could have appeared as bonus tracks on Under My Skin and are worthy of a download:<br /><br />When You're Gone<br />Innocence<br />Keep Holding On<br /><br />This album blows.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|This is a great Blu Ray release!!! 2008's Incredible Hulk delivers in spades!!! It's been a good year for Marvel(This film,and Iron Man!) and DC too(The Dark Knight)!!! If you have a Blu Ray player than this is the version to get,these kind of films look freakin' awesome on the superior Blu Ray format,it also has a super cool 3D lenicular outer sleeve too,but this collectable packaging is for a limeted term only!!! Better than the 2003 version,which is also great!!! Very recommended!!! A+
B001GQACGO|3.0|I love BDay.... and on this I like single ladies, diva and video phone. But thats basically it. The first half is a nice personal side of her but she needs to keep that slow stuff to herself..sry.  And like some of the other writers said she does come off shallow in the second half. And for anyone that thinks diva means hustla it doesnt. Divas dont have to hustle for anything, all they have to do is throw a temper tantrum to get what they want. And its strang cuz she sounds like shes trying to sound like Rihanna in one or two of her songs. I love her but she needs to find her own identity and stick to it. Rihanna got hers and shakira got hers.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I'm deeply hurt that some people are giving this album poor reviews.  This is by far the the best album I've listened to in the past few years.  This is the 1st KOL CD I have purchased after seeing them Live a few times.  I can't imagine that their other CD's could possibly be better than this one but I am sure as @#$% going to find out!  I have referred several friends to this album and have heard nothing but extremely positive comments.  They may have changed their style according to some long time fan reviewers but this album falls nothing short of spactacular!! I was listening to 'The Black Keyes' Catch and release, which is also a great album, almost every song, when I got my hands on this CD which I could tell was better after one listen. (No offense to Black Keyes but this album rocks). Trust me, just buy it.
B00004RF9I|2.0|This movie is an all-time classic because it retains its ability to entertain and to move its audience over the years.  It's been 30 years but this film ages very well as its theme of amorality, exploitation and dehumanising of people for the sake of selfish motives and the almighty dollar is still relevant today e.g. subprime, credit crisis etc.  Add that to brilliant acting by Finch in his best ever performance in a role that seems to have been written just for him as well as by Dunaway who is excellent in her role.  This powerful movie is one of my all-time favourites.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this dvd version is very poor as the picture quality has many imperfections such as white spots having not been restored and barely rises above VHS quality.  The sound quality is also poor having not been remastered.  My advice is to give this version a miss and to wait for a well restored and remastered version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options as well as good Special Features to surface either in the standard or in the new Blu-ray formats.  Surely a classic like this deserves a lot better than this poor quality dvd version.<br /><br />Updated 28 June 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately I'll have to do it here:  the blu-ray release of this great film is a bit of a mixed bag; while the picture quality has improved greatly over the dvd release I reviewed above it is not perfect and in addition to the pretty heavy grain in many frames there is somewhere in the middle of the film one very glaring straight line from top to bottom of the frame that lasts for about 10 seconds that we have to deal with.  The sound quality has improved as well although the DTS MA mono is a little disappointing as I was expecting at least one surround sound option but given that this film is very heavily dialogue driven anyway so I was able to only just forgive this indiscretion.  The special feature documentaries are a nice addition as well.  Overall, this blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd release albeit it is not perfect and still has issues that Warner Brothers have to address which makes me believe that yet another blu-ray release is on the cards hopefully coming with an improved picture quality and more surround sound options as well as in a digibook format that I like so much.<br /><br />Is it worth the double-dip/upgrade?  If you can't wait for a better future release then only just.elease is a big improvement over the dvd release albeit it is not perfect and still has issues that Warner Brothers have to address which makes me believe that yet another blu-ray release is on the cards hopefully coming with an improved picture quality and more surround sound options as well as in a digibook format that I like so much.

B00000K3UU|2.0|I loved Adam Sandler in \\"Happy Gilmore,\\" but \\"Big Daddy was almost unwatchable.  My husband and I watched this movie recently, and we had a hard time staying awake.  Sandler's character is an obnoxious, aging adolescent; his character is unlikeable and bordering on child abandonment in his treatment of his young charge.  Maybe with a young actor playing Sandler's role, this story could have been believable.  I am glad that we did not waste any money buying this DVD.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Wow!  I hadn't seen the any of the first season ever, and boy was it worth the money! The music was GREAT, the relationships intriguing, and the comedy hilarious.  I'd give this six stars if I could.  Only problem is I have to spring $40 to buy the next seasons!
B001HQZJP2|5.0|I love these movies. Quality acting, a touch of romance and plenty of action. They are movies to watch over and over.
B001HXG8PK|4.0|I won't review the music content as others did an excellent job covering the topic.  I just wanted to clarify how the packaging works.  The gray slip cover holds the hard cover book which holds the two CD's.  CD 1 is held on the inner front cover of the book; CD 2 on the inner back cover.      It is atrocious how the cd's are held in place.  There is a rubber disc where a CD clasp should be.  Once removed, the CD's are very difficult to put back in place.     The slip cover is impressive (quite sturdy and handsome) as is the book.  The images are great to look at while listening to the soundtrack.    Besides the rubber CD holders, all is well.

And if you like musicals [Well, I really don't like musicals - but this one I loved.] You will like this. It was lots of fun, and really well done, too. Watched it for free at Hulu, but the dvd will have commentary, too.
0156034026|3.0|It's very readable, and generally well-written, but fails in the end for three basic reasons.  First, the entire American girl-as-desired object is a cliche (doomed, brilliant, rich, beautiful!)-- the only thing convincing about her is his desire for her. Second, the real-time narrative-- the mannered dialogue with the ominous American \\"dinner guest\\" is utterly over the top and rings false in virtually every way. Third, and most important, I at least simply didn't believe the hero's transformation into a fundamentalist.  The author understands national and class resentments,and the spoiled privilege of the Pakistani upper class, but I don't believe he understands Islamic fundamentalism at all, and it shows.  Those hoping for a window into the psyches of the Mohammad Attas of this world will be no wiser for having read this.
B001GKJ2F2|3.0|I cant find anywhere what is on the 2nd disk? Making of? Special Features? Eh, I'll probably buy the blue ray instead. I rated this 3 stars cause thats what I though of the movie, maybe the 2nd disk stuff deserves 5....i'll never know
0143035711|5.0|I was born in the early 1950s and grew up during the golden age of television. One of the great shows in the mid sixties was a show called The Whirly Birds, based on the adventures of a for hire helicopter company in California. They used the progressively changing Model 47 Bell helicopters for the series and I was enamored with them. I knew what I wanted to do with my life and that was to fly these things.<br /><br />So as I approached the age of adulthood, I prepared to become a helo pilot. Of course back then, the only outlet for such training and a career was strictly military. So since I came up in a Navy house, I was going to join the Navy, go to flight training school, and see where I could go to fly.<br /><br />The only problem with this whole senario is that Viet Nam happened. I wasn't paying a lot of attention to it. We would eat as a family around the supper table with the tv on right there, seeing the images each night of the war that was taking place on the other side of the world, but not giving it much importance in our everyday lives. That is until I announced that I was going to join the military and fly helicopters.<br /><br />My father had had a son by another marriage in Germany, and I know he knew what was going on in Nam. He took me aside one day and said that if I really wanted to fly, then I should go to college, get a four year degree, and then after that, I could go into officer training school and then fly as an officer, hopefully getting a better assignment than a warrant officer, who basically had no authority. But what he was really saying was that he was hoping the war would be over by the time I got out of school. My father had great wisdom and the war did indeed end one month after I graduated. But I always felt that I was somehow deprived or cheated out of a childhood dream.<br /><br />That's why when Robert Mason's book Chickenhawk came out, I was anxious to see what it was like and what I had missed. I can't thank my dad enough for sparing this kind hearted kid the misery that these brave men went through.<br /><br />Chickehawk is a brutally honest look at the ravages of modern war conducted in a no-win situation.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I bought Enya Christmas cd. I think it is a wonderful Christmas cd.  I enjoyed the cd so much I played it over and over again.  The Christmas cd definetly puts you in the mood for Christmas. If you want a Christmas cd this is the one to buy.  I would highly recommend it.
B001CDLATE|4.0|Beautiful imagery. I remember watching this over and over back in college...on a worn out old VHS \\"copy\\" recorded from television. If you are a fan of this documentary then the blu-ray experience will blow you away.    There is no speaking or narration in this documentary; it's comprised of various visuals from nature mixed with technology and man made problems along with chanting and background music. The images are haunting and leave a lasting impression the first time you view them.    This was originally filmed in 70mm and the detail really shows up on blu-ray.    I find it very relaxing but I have read that some find the images unsettling.
B0001O3YD0|3.0|I recall watching this for the first time when I was 12 or so, and I remember liking it; now as an adult I've re-watched it and came to the conclusion that this is a pretty dull movie, an alien/predator rip-off. I don't see anything special about this movie. I do agree that the movie has very descent visual effects and the camera work is superb; all the colors used to show the different sunlight of the planet, from bright orange, to neon blue. But aside from that...I don't see any essentiality in the plot.<br /><br />And if you are unfamiliar with the plot don't worry, it isn't complicated at all. A commercial spacecraft crash lands on a mysterious and unknown planet; the survivors are trying to figure out what happened, looking for a way to get back home. Along with the survivors is a prisoner named Riddick, he has a special ability to see in the dark, why? Never mentioned. also there are these weird creatures or aliens (however you want to call them)  who only came out in the dark, hence the name of the movie \\"pitch black\\" since Riddick is the only one capable of seeing in the dark, they need him to survive and find their way home.<br /><br />Trust me the movie is pathetic, as I mentioned, it has nice visuals; it even has some unpredictable moments, but their short lived. I guess if you are a Vin Diesel fan you can rent it or wait for it to be shown on TV. Though don't buy it, you might regret it.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 ½ OUT OF 5
B001H5X7JS|2.0|I really can't believe the other reviews here - I'm thinking that Ben Stiller has created dozens of Amazon accounts and is posting positive reviews....    By now you know it's a spoof.  I read one of the reviews comparing it to Blazing Saddles - heresy.  This is rubbish.  What story/plot (I know it's a comedy) is paper thin.  Stiller and Black are going through the motions.  Downey is only interesting because of his black/white thing.    It's essentially an unfunny spoof Rambo.  You remember that \\"coal miner\\" segment from Zoolander - it's that kind of crap for 107 minutes.    The only thing getting it above 1 star is Tom Cruise (yes you read that right) - Tom Cruise is intentionally funny.    Inane, pointless, drivel.
B0017V7GLC|4.0|Every new Ladytron album replaces the one before it. After I heard [[ASIN:B000AY9ON0 Witching Hour]], I practically stopped listening to [[ASIN:B0002IQGM6 Light And Magic]], but now that Velocifero is out, I won't be returning to Witching Hour much. At the same time, Ladytron have made absolutely no changes to their basic style. Nearly every song has all of their trademarks: droning, chugging one-note keyboard lines, loud clumsy beats, Helen Marnie's witchy cooing and/or Mira Aroyo's vampish monotone.    So what's special about Velocifero? Well, it just sounds better. \\"I'm Not Scared\\" is a rewrite of \\"High Rise,\\" built on the same kind of monotonous chug, but it roars out of the speakers with an energy unlike anything on Witching Hour. I don't know how much influence NIN's Alessandro Cortini had on the production, but in any case, it's emblematic that they chose him -- this is their heaviest album, with lots of distorted bass and occasional industrial-tinged beats. The mechanical thump and hiss of the drums in \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Deep Blue\\" wouldn't be too inappropriate for one of KMFDM's more [[ASIN:B000IOMXTY danceable]] songs from the late eighties. Ladytron's remix of NIN's \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" was the best track on [[ASIN:B000X9PNOQ Year Zero Remixed]], and it seems that they've put that experience to good use.    The music is more detailed, in general. \\"Black Cat\\" uses the typical drone-and-thump template from Witching Hour, but there are now some chiming keyboards in the background, and a discernible lead instrument that interplays with the lead vocal. \\"I'm Not Scared\\" actually has a keyboard solo -- sure, it basically just follows the vocal line, but for Ladytron, that's already pushing the boundaries. These may sound like minor changes, but they really add variety to the album.    It also helps that Mira Aroyo finally gets some good music to sing over. (She's always been Ladytron's secret weapon: erratic, but when her songs are good, they're the band's best.) The aforementioned \\"Black Cat\\" is her best turn, if not ever, then at least since \\"Flicking Your Switch\\" on Light And Magic. Her icy declamation is perfect for Velocifero's dark bass sound. She has another fantastic appearance on \\"Kletva,\\" the only song on the album that doesn't use the typical drone-and-thump template, probably because it's a cover. The music sounds very pretty and child-like, but Aroyo's performance gives it a slightly world-weary air. It's a wonderfully understated song, one of the band's all-time best. Aroyo's English-language performances are weaker -- \\"Season Of Illusions\\" sounds virtually identical to a bunch of other songs, and \\"Deep Blue\\" is excruciatingly repetitive. But when she's on, she's really on.    By contrast, Helen Marnie's voice is occasionally overwhelmed by the production, but she also has a couple of stand-out moments, both of which seem to lift their musical content from sixties songs -- namely, the choruses of \\"Runaway\\" and \\"The Lovers.\\" I wish I could remember the song where the rhythm from \\"The Lovers\\" comes from, but in any case, it's a great, anthemic hook. The short songs on Velocifero tend to be the better ones. Also, band member Daniel Hunt, mute until now, gets his first vocal appearance in a duet with Marnie on \\"Versus.\\" He actually does pretty well, and for some reason reminds me of the guy who guested on [[ASIN:B000NVIXFA Bjork]]'s \\"The Dull Flame Of Desire.\\"     Ladytron's lyrics, unfortunately, are still pretty bad, though probably better than before. The music does mitigate them somewhat, however. A repetitive song like \\"Predict The Day\\" (or \\"Burning Up\\" -- the catchiness of the line \\"I wrote a protest song about you\\" makes me rue its meaninglessness) where the lyrics mostly consist of a couple of chanted lines, would have been unlistenable filler on Light And Magic, but here it has a jagged bass outro that gives it considerable energy. The single \\"Ghosts,\\" likewise, is carried mostly by the bass. That onlygoes so far, of course: \\"Deep Blue\\" has a pretty good industrial-disco backdrop, but the maniacal insistence on the line, \\"Deep Blue, I want to give it all to you\\" really grates.    It's not that they've overcome all their shortcomings. Ladytron are still a very, very repetitive band, even more than many of their contemporaries, and their songs tend to rely on the same musical elements. Some of the songs may be salvaged by the production, but they all use pretty much the same tricks in the same way, and often sound extremely similar. But this is probably the best they can do without making fundamental changes to their style. And, again, Velocifero improves on Witching Hour nearly track for track: \\"Black Cat\\" is better than \\"High Rise,\\" \\"Tomorrow\\" is better than \\"Beauty x2\\" or \\"All The Way,\\" and even filler like \\"Season Of Illusions\\" is better than the analogous filler \\"AMTV\\" or \\"Fighting In Built Up Areas.\\" It certainly contains more good songs than any other Ladytron album to date.
B001CZVVVO|5.0|This Berlin concert in Waldbuhne, the largest outdoor arena in Europe, is so great that you can watch over and over again. All three opera stars are brilliant and amazing! Domingo looked older than I thought but he's still a great singer with all the power and techniques. I just hoped he could be around for a long time. Both Netrebko and Villazon sing with such power and confidence as if they want to brag themselves telling how good youth is. Without a doubt, they are new \\"BIG\\" stars in a new generation. Yes, the vision and audio are at top notch. One drawback is, however, one (at least) of many cameras was probably not in HD so the vision suddenly changes to unclean and grainy look from time to time, which is actually rather annoying.

B0013J60ZG|4.0|Bille August is a well respected instructor with quite an accomplished resume that includes the Oscar winning Pelle The Conquerer, The House of  Spirits, Smilla's Sense for Snow to mention a few.<br /><br />He has over the years taken on quite significant projects often being asked to put highly acclaimed literature to the screen and in doing so struggled to find a balance allowing both commercial success and critical acclaim. I am not privy to whether this movie succeeded in either department which in fact is a relief as it enables one to give a less subjective review.<br /><br />The movie depicts the growing relationship between a common white prison guard and the politically imprisoned Nelson and Mandela. The movie claims to be based on a real story and while it is not for me judge exactly how accurately portrayed it is or how many facts were truly available to build it on it indeed was more than a pleasant watch.<br /><br />The story covers more than 30 years of South African and World history  and shows the personal transformation the guard goes through from being a one-sided racist to a more complex character as history unfolds. While I by no means will claim to be a capacity on the apartheid regimes eventual fall I assume that the journey he and his wife goes through is reminiscent of many white South Africans in the period.<br /><br />The movie depicts quite graphically the horrible doings of the apartheid regime but also render the viewer hope for a better tomorrow and shows that over time reason and justice will prevail and that human nature does have it within itself to overcome even the biggest hurdles.<br /><br />For me this was both an informative and entertaining movie that does not leave the audience after it is over.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|I really wasn't fond of the Bourne Supremacy, which boiled down to, \\"you're a trained killer, so let's get you involved in a random plot because the audience only cares if you kick butt!\\"  Fortunately, Ultimatum makes up for the lame duck sequel with a movie that actually advances the plot.<br /><br />Bourne follows a cell phone trail, similar to the latest Bond films (or rather, the Bond films took the idea from Bourne): kill a bad guy, take his phone, page through his address book, trace its location, find bad guy, repeat.  This eventually leads to the Treadstone training facility where Project Blackbriar, and Jason Bourne, was created.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum plays fast and loose with reality; occasionally Bourne just appears and disappears despite the best technology Treadstone has ad its disposable.  The message seems to be that even the best surveillance is ultimately flawed because it uses people, and people make assumptions that trip them up.  Bourne exploits the arrogance of Treadstone so effectively that he has them running in circles. There are some amazing fight scenes, thrilling chase scenes, and a few scenes that just drag on and on. Jumping from building to building in Madrid gets old after awhile.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! At the heart of The Bourne Ultimatum is the notion of a black ops team of killing machines.  The idea actually has its roots in the conspiracy theory known as Project Monarch: creating superspies through psychological conditioning and torture.  It's by no means an original idea, but Ultimatum gives it a twist by showing that Bourne had a lot more to do with the birth of his killer personality than he originally thought.<br /><br />Who is Jason Bourne?  We get his real name, find out where he was trained, and delve into the circumstances that helped create him.  The moral implications of who Bourne is and the decisions he made leading up his creation are an important part of the character, and it's a tribute to the screenwriters that it doesn't change what we love about Bourne: killing other spies (AKA \\"assets\\").t we love about Bourne: killing other spies (AKA \\"assets\\").
B001CDLATE|5.0|It's even more impressive than Planet earth.  No words although unlike \\"earth\\" it more about humans than simply nature and animals; it's just beatiful images and music; it doesn't get much better than that.  Also, make sure you view this in high-def.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.<br />The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.<br />\\"Iron Man\\" is a much better super hero movie.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Great watch for the price. No issue. Little bit thicker and shinier than expected but overall great value.
0316017922|4.0|I couldn't put this down -- it was full of brief, anecdotal profiles of \\"successful\\" folks (Bill Gates, the Beatles) and provided explanations of disasters (a Korean Air Lines crash) as well -- some explanations plausible, some less so, but all very interesting.<br /><br />Although interesting, I found much of the discussion to be presented in a conclusory, unsubstantiated way -- fine for posing a hypothesis, but a little flimsy to be presented as a defensible conclusion.  For example, Caldwell explains why (as everyone knows is true) Asians are so dang good at math  . . . . because their ancestors are used to working 3000 hours a year tending rice paddies (unlike those of us of Western European descent, whose farming predecessors didn't put in nearly such long hours) and because their numbers are quicker to pronounce -- you won't find a two-syllable time-consumer like \\"seven\\" in Chinese.  Huh??  As a Caucasian MIT grad sharing my home with two math-phobic Chinese folks, that chapter gave all of us a good laugh.  I found the section on why Jews were successful as lawyers -- the WASPS had no interest in the messy business of litigation and left that to the Jews -- to be similarly conclusory.<br /><br />Stereotypes aside, the underlying premise of the book is interesting.  All of us are products of our environments, our cultures, our supporters, a myriad of circumstances and opportunities.  Success and failure doens't occur in isolation, and individuals and not individually responsible for the ultimate sucess in life.  Economic advantage creates a sense of entitlement and has a strong bearing on success in life.

B000VWYJ86|1.0|Only one thing to say about this debacle. While I really liked the first one, the new director and editor have screwed this into a cocked hat. I began counting the edits in the film about 15 minutes in.  I gave up during one of the many fight scenes when I finally couldn't keep count.  In a slow scene you might actually get one that's 7 seconds long! In the fight scenes the edits come so fast and furious - they're in half seconds or 12 frames.  The longest I was able to count was about 2 seconds long, and that was an exception.<br /><br />So, the fights make no sense.  We just see bodies in motion.  If you turn down the volume, its ludicrous at best.  BOO!!  Two sequels ruined by this crappy techinque of substituting action with frame to frame editing!  Even MTV never got this bad!
B00005JPTK|3.0|The second disc has a different ending. The box describes the alternative ending as \\"controversial;\\" which in realty is NOT that controversial. Buy the special edition only if the price is the same the one for the regular version. Also, the free digital version is NOT for MAC. It only works with Windows.
B000O179A4|3.0|I've never seen the Broadway show of DREAMGIRLS but I know it's been around for a long time.  Maybe if I'd followed this story's history better I could've navigated the movie a little better...but I was thrown by the insertion of conventional musical numbers into a really good dramatic film.<br /><br />It's a story about music so there could've been plenty of songs but having the actors burst into song during some heavy dramatic scenes threw me off a little.  It didn't have to lapse into that convention.<br /><br />Everyone was excellent.  Eddie Murphy was outstanding.  It's a finely-crafted film that left me wondering just how far removed it was from the real-life story of Diana Ross and the Supremes.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky provides an in-depth look of what it is like to grow up in high school. While the sex, drugs, and teen angst may all seem a little cliché, Chbosky does an amazing job of realistically portraying high school situations in a uniquely hilarious way through the protagonist Charlie. The story is told through Charlie's devastating letters to whom the reader may not know he is writing. The theme woven through Charlie's letters is his constant struggle between passivity and passion. Letter by letter the reader is drawn into Charlie's fanatical world only to be in awe at the story's end.     The story begins with the start of Charlie's freshman year in high school where he is prone to depression, shy, introverted, and \\"on the fringes of life\\" after dealing with the losses of a friend and his Aunt Helen. He is a wallflower, someone intelligent beyond his years but socially awkward. Some of the few people to notice Charlie's intelligence are his English teacher and newfound senior friends Sam and Patrick. With their help Charlie comes to terms with life and learns to interact. Letter by letter the plot unfolds as Charlie learns to deal with almost every tough issue know to a teen. Chbosky handles these tragic issues so well that they come off as realistic rather than over-the-top. This realism is why I believe The Perks of Being a Wallflower is such a special book.    Chbosky further develops the theme of Charlie's struggle between passivity and passion through the constant pressures he must face in his freshman year in high school. Whether it is dances, first dates, drugs, sexuality, or the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Charlie is relentlessly barraged with the task of eliminating his social awkwardness. Chbosky's realistic style leaves an impact on the reader by placing him or her into Charlie's world. There the reader gets an up close and personal view of each developing situation and becomes attached to the ups and downs associated with Charlie's life. Charlie's relationship with his teacher Bill also parallels one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is the clash between young adult and adult culture. While Charlie is trying to identify himself as a man, he continuously finds himself running away from his life and reverting back to a childlike state. Bill acts as an intermediate force between these clashing worlds and tries to get Charlie to lead a normal high school life and further provide an identity for Charlie. Bill helps Charlie get his mind off the things Charlie is running away from through books and essay writing.    In my opinion, Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book that should be read by all high school students. Chbosky offers humor, drama, and a unique quality to the story that keeps the reader entertained with each turning page. The novel is truly an entertaining read and I would recommend it to anyone who has experienced the highs and lows of high school.

B0000542D2|4.0|A Hard Day's Night is not a \\"movie\\" in the conventional sense.  It doesn't really have a plot.  It allows viewers to tag along at the height of the Beatles' early popularity and get a real sense of the power and charm of their music.  No one had ever had such an impact on music and youth culture before them, and probably no one since.  This film gives a glimpse of how they regarded their phenomenal fame: whimsically and with humorous irreverence.  They just set out to make music and have fun and accidentally changed everything that followed, from hair and fashion to music and social consciousness.  If you want to understand pop music in the late 20th century, this may not be the starting point, but it is a \\"don't miss\\" stop on the journey.  Do remember, though, that this is not the whole story of the Beatles: this is their early phase, and they continued to create, evolve, and experiment at a breathtaking pace for several years after this film was shot.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins' study of business core values, principles and success concepts was expected to be timeless, even if the companies in the book were not. This is never more true than in the later half of 2008 where we see time after time companies missing the mark on these concepts and faltering badly.<br /><br />I suggest that Congress, the auto makers, unions and especially Wall Street read carefully, no study the concepts in Good to Great.  Had Fannie Mae continued the principles it displayed in this study, the housing crisis could have had a leader in future prosperity rather than a goat in the middle of the mess.<br /><br />Take the time to study these principles of business carefully and not only follow them, live them.  Jim Collins has created a book that is more than good to great, its Built to Last!

The manufacturer's descriptions always sound so lovely and then they smell terrible, so its impossible to know what to look for.<br /><br />I loved reading the Emperor of Scent, and after reading that book and now the Perfume guide I was able to find a couple of perfumes that are perfect for me, based on Luca and Tania's recommendations. The descriptions are so detailed it made it really easy for me to figure out which ones I'd like.  Thats not to say I totally agree with all of their choices, because perfumes are still a very personal choice, but I will continue to use the book as a gift giving guide to find scents that I can afford, that fit different personalities.

This little guy (if Charlie Chaplin were a Tonka Truck) has more personality and charm than any animated character since Yoda.

There are two extras on the disc: the Magician & Rabbit tale that you saw in the theater (clever and funny) and a never seen before extra called \\"Burn-E\\" about the tale of another little robot that takes place in the backgourn of the main movie.

0446691437|2.0|Steven Pressfield had the opportunity and premise to do something great here; however, 'great' is not at all what The War of Art is. An elitist, ego-centric, ethno-centric, uncompassionate, un-empathetic, and a narrow-boxed view of things (seemingly based in the school of Scientology) breakdown of procrastination is what you get. I understand that this book is meant to be a 'no-excuses' book camp for the mind. Motivation however does not have to be belittling. Pressfield manages to dispel psychology and modern medicine and the fact that some people have real problems. Moreover; he not only mocks the idea of socio-economic status being a real influence in procrastination and where life leads us; but he goes as far as to mock the culture(s) that may live within. Negatively referring to 'RAP' music and using the term 'Homies' in a discerning tone; as if an affluent male born in 1943 is such an expert to comment on these things.    Take out the fact that over 80% of this book has 1 page chapters, or that the same message is delivered in this 'cliff's notes' style; what Pressfield has done is to take his own life and his own experiences and said \\"This is how I see it; this is how it is; everyone in this world is afforded the same health and opportunities as me; see how I can fit everything into a neat box?\\". If the book was title \\"I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread and because I'm not lazy; neither should you be\\"; then you'd have a winner on your hand.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is simply he best comedy ever written. I bought this collection for a friend in the Hotel/Resturant business, who never did see this show. I highly recommend for anyone, but it is a must see if you are in the Hotel/Resturant business.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Listening to this CD is nothing but an exercise in frustration. You'll spend every song waiting for a climax that never comes. It's so obvious even to someone who's not a musician where every one of these songs should have gone but didn't. You'll hear it in your mind and wonder why the hell LP didn't hear the same and produce it. Sounds like they were just [...] around the entire time. I've listened to this three times in the span of a year b/c each time I was hoping it wasn't as bad as I'd remembered and it was equally disappointing each time to the point I skipped past nearly every song on the third go. I have wide musical tastes so I can appreciate different things, but what they tried to do here just didn't work and they knew it and apparently didn't care. I won't be buying anything from LP again without doing my research and listening to it first. I'll only be fooled once, never again.
0316067598|5.0|When I was a kid every adult male I knew fought in World War II.  I had an uncle in the Pacific and one in the Battle of the Bulge.  I read Guadalcanal Diary and To Hell and Back.  While maybe a stern edit of this book might be in order, I believe Lone Survivor will become a classic like the ones I mentioned.  Let's put politics aside because from what I  gather from reading the reviews, liberal anti Bush folks hate this book.  Frankly, the end is a bit gushy even for me, but the battle narrative is riveting and that is why you would buy the book. To be sure, a bad decision put the team at risk but from what I have been told and from what I have read, in WWII the goat herders would have been killed and forgotten in a minute.  That said, the selfless heroism and the honor shown among the SEAL team is extraordinary and I would urge young people to read about it since actually finding these qualities in American culture today would be exceedingly rare.
B000002J6F|3.0|I've always been a fan of CSNY and many of their individual works. Manassas with Stepen Stills was all right, but it lacked something.  I dig it out once and awhile and listen to it, but it's not one of my favorites for this group of guys.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|It's a renewed pleasure to listen to Genesis at their beginning but with a whole new remastered sound that doesn't take away any of the original flavours of the songs. The set contains Genesis classics such as \\"Stagnation\\", \\"The Knife\\", \\"The Musical Box\\", \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", \\"Supper's Ready\\", \\"The Cinema Show\\", \\"Firth of Fifth\\" and of  course the Lamb album. It also contains never before released songs, songs that were created as a soundtrack to a movie that never saw the light of day. The extras are, in my views, very valuable as we see and hear each band member describe how the songs came together. The box set itself is pretty and handy. This is of course very interesting for the hardcore fan but could serve as an introduction to the band and its work for the newer generation.
1577314808|5.0|This book has actually changed my life, my way of seeing the world and the way I view death and everything in between. I bought it on CD, downloaded it on my ipod and listened to it as I walked on the beach. The combination of hearing him speak and being in such a powerful and natural setting I think I was actually brain-washed in a very positive way. I really feel different now as if I could handle more of life's woes in a more universal and logical way. It's all about living in the now which is easy if you try to remain as aware at all times as you possible can. Nothing is forever and once you come to terms with that then living in the now becomes the most powerful and fulfilling way of being in this world. Thank you Eckhart Tolle.
B001GSV3EC|4.0|...and yes, I am a long time Jeff Beck fan, I have seen him a number of times live, have most of his albums, and own all the previous legitimate live releases, including the recent USA bootleg and BB King blues club shows, and several dozen live recordings from previous tours dating back to Truth....  With that lovely disclaimer aside, I found the performance lacking the fire I have come to expect.  Some of the tracks are outstanding.  As a whole, I didn't find it awe inspiring.  I would certainly recommend purchasing, but would defer to the USA 2006 and BB King shows.
0316236535|1.0|My daughter and son both found this book frightening. My daughter is a real tough cookie and rarely cries but this book really scared her. I have now hidden it.
0312567448|1.0|This book just didn't feel warm and romantic to me. Certainly it's professionally done, but felt a little too corporate. Doesn't seem to add much to what else is already out there. Not really anything new or interesting, IMHO.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I am a fan of Jules Verne, which is why I wanted to watch this movie. The special effects are fantastic and storyline is decent & fun throughout the movie. It is also action packed and this is good. I think this is a good movie for children too.    The acting by Brendan Fraser is simply awful. The poor man can't act (in my opinion) and the rest of the cast was alright in terms of their acting skills.
B001EO748M|4.0|Hello!1 I'm really want this dvd, but I have a question, somebody can tell me if this DVDS come in Spanish, I'm sure the first season you can select spanish.    Helpme please!!!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This movie is hillarious. I have to say too that I had to keep reminding myself that it was Robert Downey, Jr. You do forget during the movie! It's a funny movie with lots of surprising guest stars!
B001EN71DG|5.0|The movies are great and yeah it is a rerelease so guess what? if you already have the movies DONT BUY THIS. But this gives you both versions on dvd which is nice. I bought this after my old dvds got scratched.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|This is a story of a \\"slum dog\\" Jamal and of life as an orphan kid in Mumbai. The movie is absolutely beautiful, horrific and funny at times. In the journey from a slum dweller to a millionaire Jamal goes through many trials and also finds love.    The way this movie is put together is brilliant. While poverty in India, human exploitation and rags to riches stories have all been done before - this is the first movie that puts it all together in one.    I found that this movie truly brings attention to the lives of the millions of kids in India who live off the streets and to the exploitation that they face. Well enough of my review - I do not wish to spoil this experience which you should watch.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|I forgot what a good movie the original Rambo was.  I watched it through completely again, just the basic movie, and there was so much I'd forgotten.  It's a great tale -- basically the local authority gets a little too loose in the use of his power and picks on the wrong guy: Rambo.  Mel Gibson's \\"Apocalypto\\" is almost the exact same movie but frankly Rambo did it first and did it better (and did it with a lot less gore!).<br /><br />But that's not why you want this DVD set.  If you just want to watch Rambo you can rent it.<br /><br />You want THIS set because of the extras.  It was actually worth watching the whole movie AGAIN with Stallone's commentary running instead of the regular soundtrack.  Stallone fills in some backstory about the characters, why the sheriff is the way he is and a whole heap of a tale about the making of the film.  Did you ever wonder why films today are so clean cut and Hollywood just can't seem to produce the dark grit of films like Rambo anymore?  Well, listen to Stallone tell his tale and you'll understand why films like Rambo just don't get made very often.<br /><br />I confess I'm doing this review without having seen the other two movies yet but the first movie with the extras has already justified my purchase.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the other two and hearing what Stallone has to say about them as well.  There are haters out there who hate on Rambo because it's not up to par with their level of sophistication but the loss is theirs.  Rambo is a great film and Stallone's commentary adds a lot of value to this set.
B000001FSR|5.0|Before Blockbuster wiped them out, there were all kinds of small video stores you could rent from in Simi Valley. At its height and glory along a one block stretch you could find three shops equidistant from each other. My favorite was a mom and pop video store in a strip mall right next to the Albertsons called \\"the video shop\\", and their catch was that a person could rent five movies for five dollars for five nights. Due to the luxurious demands of community college, I blazed through all my choices in two or three nights. I don't even remember most of the movies I rented, they just blew by. Sometimes a movie like Night Flyer or TapeHeads will start playing on cable and I'd say, \\"oh yeah, I saw that! I rented that from the shop!\\"    One of the reasons for so many return visits was the lady behind the counter. Her hair was dark red and arched up in what could be described as a poodle's pony tail. In hindsight she was probably in her early thirties, but I didn't have that kind of eye to judge yet. Greedy little assumptions assured me she was in her mid twenties with only a trace of husky, which is as skinny as you are going to get if you are a woman working in my hometown. Petit and slender are for trophy wives.    We would talk about show business. I read books on becoming an actor as a kind of fantastical wish fulfillment, and she wanted to work as an administrative assistant in a movie studio. Past that it was the usual video store shop talk. Talking about the guy who wants a refund on porn he rented, or praising clerks while mallrats plays on a tv screen behind the counter.    Deep down, all there were was wishes in a slow, rolling illusion for her to look at me like she wanted me, and then touch my hand in understanding. To go in that little bathroom in the corridor that lead into the alley and kiss, grab, knee, rub, hold, elbow, sweep, cheek, slide in that tiny little room like it meant something more.    As Blockbuster slid closer and closer to perfecting itshold on the video rental market, mom and pop video stores started to close all around Simi. First Video Super Store, which was below a now defunct Fuddruckers. Then the Shop went next, followed by Music Plus and finally just this last year, The Wherehouse. I remember I didn't buy anything, or pillage, I just let it go. My only act of surrender was a Variety magazine to give to the lady behind the counter, \\"and help her on her way\\". It just stayed in the back of my trunk, because she wasn't there anymore. I ran into her about a year later in a local coffee shop called \\"Dr Conkey's\\". She was there with a fierce looking construction worker who drove a supe'd up high and tall pickup truck. We didn't speak.    The strangest of mementos came from that shop. The movie that stuck with me the most was Smoke staring Harvey Keitel and William Hurt. An ensemble piece about the relationships revolving around a cigar shop in Brooklyn, it is a very eccentric, erratic work and one of the first screenplays by Paul Auster. I finally found a DVD in a Virgin superstore in San Francisco, lost it, and bought another copy online.    A copy is kept for sentimental reasons. Over the credits the film reenacts a short story of Paul Auster, \\"Augie's Christmas Story\\". The movement is a montage in black and white, with Tom Waits' \\"You're innocent when you dream\\" playing underneath. That was the very first time I heard a Tom Waits song. I thought \\"Who is this? I have never heard anything like this in my entire life!\\" When Christmas came around I got beautiful maladies, best of Tom Waits :Island years, which became one of the top three in my rotation for that year along with Enema of the State by blink-182 and 1965 by the Afghan Whigs.    A little while rolled along and I realized I must dig deeper. The Black Rider was too dark and disjointed. Rain Dogs seemed inevitable and didn't give me the thrill of the chase. But Frank's Wild Years, had my song, that settled it. The sampling of beautiful maladies was no preparation for the awesome power of the album, which I received (along with Rain Dogs). That Album blew me away. It is one of the few I can listen to all the way through without skipping or complaint. More jazzy, upbeat and concentrated than his other works, each song pops on its own and adds to the overall experience with an album crescendo in the last three songs of \\"cold, cold, ground\\", \\"train song\\", and another reprise of \\"you're innocent when you dream\\". This album is a Bebop Americana wet dream.    My favorite song is \\"train song\\", which could be described as ebullient tragedy, or a sad celebration. A melancholic Frank sings of the train that is coming to take him back to where he came from, back home. After he finishes singing the tune picks up to Dixieland swing sending him off. It made such an impression on me that I choose the song to perform a modern dance piece for an Intro to Modern Dance class. Mercifully, these performances are very rare, and if it weren't for my joy of the song holding me up saying \\"yeah, this is sane! I look great, and not at all undignified!\\" it would have been a train wreck.    Time marched on to other CDs and artists grabbing for my attention. My CD collection grew and expanded as I rolled along, but from time to time Frank was pulled out to anchor myself. The piles of CDs finally surpassed the 600 CD blue cabinet in my room and out onto the floor. Then one day I moved and it took about 7 boxes of various shapes to crate all the CDs from my parent's home in Moorpark to my room for rent in Westlake Village.    Typing on a cheap plastic cabinet with rollers and desk exempt, I started humming \\"Hang on St. Christopher\\". Forgetting the lyrics, the only words mumbled out are about \\"Forth and Hennepin\\" forcibly splintered into the rhythm of the song. My body starts kneeling to the floor and crawling on all fours with eyes hunting for the case in one of the post-moving mangled stacks surrounding the light socket closest to the closet. Pulling out Madman across the Water from the boom box and switching, I type and I listen. Jeez, I forgot how good \\"yesterday is here\\" is. Somewhere in the beginning of \\"cold, cold ground\\", Tom is howling out a \\"yeahoowww!\\" and the CD skips then repeats over and over again. It's a pretty scary, fearsome noise that I let repeat for a little while because moments like these are pretty rare.    The CD had this weird splotch on the bottom. The milky cloud wouldn't rinse and just stayed ingrained. The Boom Box wouldn't read past track 15. The disc was done. Placed on a shelf away from the music area and then out to the trash in the morning. I had worn out my first CD, and the happy compliment goes to Tom Waits. What kind of salute do you give this? A nod of the head in recognition and a smile in thanks for the work that went into making a piece of music that meant so much to me.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Love it love it love it. I've never seen X Files so I don't think this is only for fans of X Files. Science takes center stage, which is pretty unusual in most 'science' fiction, and it is fascinating stuff. Fans of LOST should really like this, with a little dash of Alias thrown in. It also has an affinity with CSI. I feel they've achieved a nice mix of keep-you-glued-and- guessing season-long arch plot and mythology with stand-alone mysteries solved nearly every episode. The characters are well-written. Often shows like this might be accused of being too serious, but this show has a lot of character-driven humor. Watch it for John Noble's portrayal of 'mad' scientist Walter. This has become my must watch live while glued to the couch show, like LOST.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I adore this movie for so many reasons.  While I'm a huge P&P (Austen) fan, this story is undoutably more thoughtful.  To have a female writer who understands business and economics in this time period (specifically  the cotton industry in England's industrial revolution) and successfully intertwines this aspect with a love story that can not fail to touch you is incredible.  The cinematography is ideal for this story also.  If you like historical fiction and a bit of romance, this can not fail to please!
1416562605|4.0|As an expat, I found the descriptions of day to day life of India's poor very accurate. The quick witted humor also makes an otherwise horrific story quite enjoyable. However, the more I read, the more I got the feeling that this is a perfect made for movie book.

0765316897|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite new authors, and with the final book of the Mistborn Trilogy he further establishes himself. Brandon weaves a tale of suspense, mystery, and thrills. He writes amazing action scenes that allow you to vividly picture the action. The Hero of Ages ties up all loose threads and answers all questions, leaving the reader with a sense of awe. When you think he's going to do one thing, he goes in a completly different direction, all without creating any inconsistencies.
0575081406|5.0|Everyone who knows me or has heard my opinions knows that I don't consider ANYTHING that's been published, filmed, or programmed in the last 40 years to be 'the best' of it's genre. This little gem of a book made me COMPLETELY change my opinion. In fact I might say this is the best (fictional) novel i've ever read (before you start commenting: yes I have read Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, His Dark Materials, Gone with the Wind, Dracula, Frankenstein etc etc etc).<br /><br />The concept of this novel is VERY simple: A person recounting their entire life (or at least the first THIRD of it) as a legendary character. The writing's simple, but never stupid. The characters are well drawn without diverting from the main story. The over-all plot is familiar, yet facinating. Things never seem to go quite the way you think, but they always make sense.<br /><br />If I had one complaint it would be that the world that this story takes place in isn't very original in and of itself (think His Dark Materials mixed with the early Wheel of Time books--without elves or ogres). Most of the story (probably 3/4ths) takes place in or around a University, but don't worry: This is NO Harry Potter. There's not even really any magic per-se (alchemy maybe?), but there are hints of magical creatures (Chandrians). This is not really a bad thing, but it'll be the characters and situations that draw you in, not the setting.<br /><br />Again, I must say this book is NOT to be missed. It's probably not for everyone (what is?), and for a fantasy novel there isn't really any 'action' or epic battles (someone DOES get set on fire) but if you can dig it's unique story telling this will be one of the best books you'll ever read.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Loved the movies, nice package, no frills, good price.      These are my Sunday afternoon cold outside too lazy to do anything and there's nothing on TV chill out on the couch movies.    What more could you want?
B0000C1HLF|2.0|After watching this movie and drawing my own conclusions,I give it two stars. I did not buy it,...rented it instead. Anyway,I came to the conclusion that it lacked a plot,...that was problem no.1. Problem no.2,  Bernie Mac as Bosley was downright horrible. Problem no.3,Kelly(Jaclyn  Smith)was not given a big enough role in this movie. Her appearance in  the film was all too brief to say the least. I would have loved to have seen Kelly go after Angel-gone-bad Demi Moore and show her a few things about respect for the boss,...Charlie,of course! Drew,Cameron,and Luci  were okay,...but they lacked the professionalism that the original Angels  had. This movie would have been better if Kelly would have had a much bigger role in the film. In fact,she could have ran the office in place of Bosley in this film,...perhaps better. Still,the film was okay to say the least. It could have used a bit more of a story line,and still have the humor. Since Kelly(Jaclyn Smith)was not given a much bigger role in this flm,I will not be buying it!
B00008XEP5|4.0|The first 6 or 7 songs on here are classic and pretty groudbreaking hard rock/metal. They seem to have taken everything up to this point and come up with something new and refreshing, and it's the most influential music they put out perhaps.    So many riffs on here seem to come back on Metallica's \\"Kill Em All\\", the influence and what they were shooting for is undeniable. It is great that Metallica took it to the next level. Diamond Head should have been huge, but perhaps this was their legacy, just to be one of the most important bands. Being the first doesn't always mean the best, but they certainly earned a place in metal history, and that's something particularly in metal that's hard to come by.     Around the song \\"Shoot Out the Lights\\" I think it is, they pretty much start sounding like UFO and Thin Lizzy for the most part though on the version I have.    My fav is \\"The Prince\\", and \\"Am I Evil\\". \\"Sweet And Innocent\\" also has a very appealing sound, some harmony is injected to that track that sets it apart. Really I could take the first 5 songs in particular and pick any one of them to be my fav.  There is a song on the later half of the CD I thought I was gonna like called \\"Waited Too Long\\", it has a nice start to it and once it get's going it seems like it's gonna be killer, but it doesn't really get going heavy enough and there are not the early changes and riffs of the first group of songs, like I said it all is just hard rock of the times on the extra songs.      I often try to imagine back in 1980 people hearing stuff by bands like Iron Maiden, Motorhead,  and Diamond Head, and wishing I could see the expressions on their face as they wonder \\"how do they do that?\\" And being a musician and wanting to learn to play like this was probably a daunting task to say the least. It was an exciting time, Metal was still young, but from here on out, it became very excitable and unpredictable...just as something maturing and growing tends to be.    Anyway everyone who is into metal and the history of metal needs this one in their collection, whatever version you get doesn't really matter as long as you get ahold of the debut you'll be happy.     Fav songs:  1. Am I Evil  2. The Prince  3. Lightning To The Nations  4. Sweet And Innocent  5. Sucking My Love  6. Helpless  7. It's Electric

0385340990|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It's an easy read, with good character development and a dose of history about a place and time we here in America know little about.  I would even recommend it to my friends who aren't interested in history, because it's a spoon full of sugar (a good story) that helps the medicine (a history lesson) go down!

B001ACH4DS|5.0|I love this album. I am so impressed with the seasoned sound he has & the vocal quality he has. The range of the moods & tempos of the songs is great. I have been playing it in my car ever since & received it. I usually hear the whole album at least once a day & have the songs running through my head all day long at work or home, from the time I wake up until I drift off to sleep at night.
B00004UFTU|3.0|having just been introduced to Marillion recently via \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" and liking that project pretty well I decided to try another by them and after reading reviews ordered \\"Script\\".  Was dissapointed as the songwriting was extremely simplistic and repetative.  A couple of bright spots but overall was not impressed.  Sounded more like a garage band trying to play prog.  I am a fan of Trevawas with Transatlantic and expected much more from this cd
B001H5X7I4|3.0|I watched \\"Tropic Thunder\\" last night and while there were parts that were genuinely funny, there was way too much swearing.  Saying the \\"F\\" word because you can does not make it funny.  Don't get be wrong; I am not a prude or a shrinking violet.  I have been known to tell a bawdy joke or swear like a sailor (sorry, sailors) and in context the use of adult language can be very funny (e.g., Eddie Izzard).  Here is comes across as filler, as if just saying it made it funny.  It didn't.

The story is awful. I love romance books and movies but this is just terrible. The movie was put together well it is just the story line. I couldn't wait until it was over. I almost turned it off in the middle of it but kept going. The best part of the story is literally the last 3 minutes.

1591841666|2.0|Important things are really hard to do. You should finish some of the things you start, but not others.     There. I just saved you $12.95 ($16.00 in Canada).     The book really doesn't say much more than that. My *hope* was for clues on how to identify lost causes, but the book is pretty much devoid of these - all we get is the mantra that important things are difficult, and sometimes we should quit but sometimes we shouldn't, repeated in a variety of marginally uninteresting ways.    There is a *lot* of life management and motivational material out there. I should know - I'm a student of this genre. This one is not one to add to your collection, unless its a very, very small collection.     Maybe not even then.
0618871713|5.0|Bechdel rocks as a comic artist for over 20 years.    This book is a huge, surprising, candid, funny, serious, revealing slice of her real (you-can't-make-this-stuff-up) life. (and the art is so pleasant)  If you like this kind of work, spend the ten bucks, you won't be sorry.    PS  try to read it without reading about the story/plot in a review, the story really twists and turns and all that will be lost if you hear about it in some blunt summary!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My wife and I have been playing Settlers since 2001. Since then we have introduced dozens of friends to the game and none have been disappointed. The game is easy to learn, allows for different strategies with each new game, and is ridiculously fun.

0575081406|4.0|Despite something of an in media res beginning, Rothfuss's debut effort will only slowly hook you. But when it does, game over.    The bulk of the book's material is staged as a series of interviews in which the hero tells his life story to a traveling 'chronicler'. The interviews themselves are set against the backdrop of an invasion of impossibly nasty spider-like creatures.     The book is well-written. The dialogue is believable and witty. Few sentences could be described as clumsy. What makes the book great, however, is the way in which Rothfuss has imagined his characters' physical universe. In a manner that brings Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' books to mind, Rothfuss has dreamt up the practice of 'sympathy', by which energy can be transferred between individuals and entities. This little quirk of his world's natural laws gives Rothfuss much to play with, and the historical world he builds on this natural one is fascinating.     If you're not hooked immediately, give the book the benefit of the doubt and finish it. You'll be addicted by the end.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I am writing this review to inform buyers to check their disc upon arrival.  When I received my disc, there were multiple deep scratches located on the disc.  It didn't affect the playability of the movie but it's disappointing considering that this should have arrived in brand new condition.  It seems to have been damaged by the manufacturer/packager and not by amazon.  I am currently in the process of returning this movie which is quite a hassle considering I'm in Iraq at an APO adddress.
0743270754|4.0|I purchased this book on my AMAZING kindle prior to boarding a flight back to San Francisco after spending the weekend in Washington DC.  I found that the author has an uncanny ability to provide an interesting and indepth perspective on a historical time which I had minimal previous knowledge.  As someone with a science background, I found myself drawn in further with each click of the \\"next page.\\"  The almost 6 hour flight flew by and I found myself reading the book while waiting for my luggage to appear at the turnstile (yes, I had luggage checked in for a weekend flight as the overcrowded plane did not allow for much luggage to be brought onto the plane.)    I'm still in the process of reading the book (hence why I could only give it 4 stars at the current time), but thought it was important to write a quick review in the hopes of inspiring fellow history amateurs to pick up or purchase the book to read.    With the current political times, it is important to be aware of what history has shown and taught us.  While it may seem like a lengthy book, its detail and appealing sense of story-like narration allows for those who may not have a history background to be informed while not bored.  If you have a kindle, download a sample and see if it is for you.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Just like to give a nod to this old standby.  As cliched as it sounds, Catan did help to launch my interest in a whole wide world of fantastic, well crafted strategy games.  While I don't play it much anymore, I still think Catan is a great introduction to another level of boardgames.  There's plenty of randomness in the game to balance it for inexperienced players, but it does introduce a simple system of economic and resource management combined with strategic placement and player trading that has been echoed in many subsequent games.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Very pleased with this watch.  Had a Citizen and a couple of other watches over the years.  This one will outlast them all and you can feel the quality.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Sooooo many things have been said about her like she can't play guitar or sing!!! Well 1st off YES she can sing. Like her voice? I do, I also like the way she sounds live. Regardless of what kind of equipment some people say she has.   2nd she plays guitar. I play guitar and can play her songs and can learn them by watching HER!!!    Onto the CD. It is a little pop, but its more ROCK as well. Its just not so depressing/emotional as under my skin. This album is very positive.   The songs are avril lavigne songs. That's the sound you get from her. In almost every song EVER Its the sound that commands such a following mainly because of the consistantcy of it. If you like one you like them all kind of thing.    Anyone who likes one of them should buy this CD. If you think She's hot and want to see if she makes good music. Yes. If you don't like her or her music don't buy it and DON'T write a review! This album also may not appeal to OLD-er people who are still listing to 70's rock, but its a possibility I know some who do.     Cool, catchy, deep, rock/pop, awesome!
B0009X766Y|4.0|I'm not sure what other people are saying about the widescreen format. however, there is no need for this material to be on two discs. disc two just has a documentary and some other stuff. there's not really enough bonus features. also, there's no feature commentary. boo!
0312997221|5.0|You only have to read the prologue to understand that you have picked up a masterpiece in thriller/fiction writing. Though this novel is fiction, the facts are juxtaposed brilliantly. The tunnel rats exercises in Vietnam, the mujahedeen madrasas in Saudia and Afghanistan, the Talebani fanaticism and of course the tracking of Osama Bin Laden and how the Avenger almost plucks the joker right out of the pack of the American Intelligence services makes for thrilling reading.<br />It starts with the brutal murder of a teenager who leaves his studies and passionately pursues giving his all as an aid worker in strife torn Bosnia by a group of politically fed Serbian terror gang known as Zoran's Wolves who are looked after by the Marshall Tito regime.<br />The grandfather of the boy who is a business magnate enlists the services of a Tracker and the Avenger to get to the bottom of the mystery involving his missing grandchild. The strategising of the Avenger in hunting the Serbian ganglord is pure genius. This is pulse reading and you can't help but acknowledge Forsyth as a master writer.<br />It is amazing that this book has not been turned into a film yet. It has all the spice to make it a cracker!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This film, directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento) is a full-on, in-your-face tour de force which grabs on and does not let go. In this sequel, Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale (Reign of Fire, Empire of The Sun, American Psycho, Batman Begins) is still fighting crime in Gotham City, taking down the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) early in the film, but running across copycats dressing like him who hurt more than help. The new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart (Thank You For Smoking) is putting criminals behind bars, mainly the mob, which is having problems of its own, in the form of the mysterious criminal known only as the Joker (Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, A Knight's Tale, Ten Things I Hate About You), who is literally robbing the mob blind. The film works as not just a superhero movie, not just a Batman movie, but as a Crime-Drama epic in the tradition of Heat. Several solid actors provide terrific support, including Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, TV's The Dead Zone) as a sleazy tabloid reporter and Eric Roberts as crime boss Sal Maroni. Three actors return from the first Nolan Gotham City Protector project-Gary Oldman (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Air Force One) returns as Lieutenant Gordon; Oscar Winner Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) is back as Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred and Oscar Winner Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Kiss The Girls, Along Came A Spider, The Shawshank Redemption) returns as Batman's version of \\"Q\\" Lucius Fox. The only character who has had a facelift is Rachel Dawes, originally played by Katie Holmes, but filled in by Maggie Gyllenhal for this film. There is even a humorous moment in the film involving a cryptozoological piece of footage. This is one of the top films of the decade, certainly the film of the year. 5 out of 5 stars!!!
0152048049|4.0|Anyone wantin' a good yarn will be disappointed by The Little Prince...it is Existentialist Philosophy For Kids. The Gallic weltanschauung transcends translation. Read a few pages and you'll know exactly what I mean...and know that this tone will persevere the rest of the way.    For a kid's book it IS profound...though at the cost of being entertaining. No youngster will be readin' this under the covers with a flashlight and wide eyes. But it is a significant work, and should be gotten under the belt.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|I went into this film with only expectations of it being shot in Mumbai, and that is was good.  I was not disappointed. The visuals are magnificent and the soundtrack is amazing. It was almost two hours long, but I wanted more.   Seeing the life of most people in India is shocking, and the human rights abuses are shocking, but the sprit of humanity, and survival show us how important it is to LIVE life, and not just look at it.   Knowing the financial crunch we are in in the USA, you will feel very fortunate for everything you have after seeing this film.  It was shot beautifully, the characters believeable and compassionate, and a story that will last the test of time.  Thank you Danny Boyle for bring such a great vision to the screen.  I will see this movie again and again.
B000KF62MK|4.0|Although the dvd case lists a behind-the-scenes look about the movie and interviews with cast members It actually contains a 40+ year history of the comic book series. I enjoyed this more than a Fox Channel casting session or the life after film school as listed on the case. If you are a fan of the comic book series then you will more than love this dvd.
159448385X|5.0|I can't put into words how great this book is.  As tormenting as it is to read (especially because I am a mother and there are children involved in this story,) I couldn't put it down.  I didn't know I could read so much in such a short period of time.  Hosseini is a brilliant writer.  I can't believe a man could write from the perspective of women in the manner that he did.  Thank you for giving us a glimpse into the hearts and minds of the women beneath the burqa.  Very necessary reading.  Everyone must read this.  And I hope another movie is made out of this one.
B000H5U832|5.0|This Movie is a great way to spend family time. Very cute. The whole family will love it. Thank you

0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has been captivating readers with unforgettable love stories for over a decade. His new release, The Lucky One, comes next after Nights in Rodanthe, an earlier Spark's novel adapted into a screen play that is currently showing and starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane.<br /><br />The hero of this story is Logan Thibault, a United States Marine, who served three tours of duty in Iraq. On his last tour in Iraq, he finds a photo of a beautiful young lady in the sand. He displays the picture on the base bulletin board, but no one claims it. Since there was no claimant for the picture, he carries it in his pocket.<br /><br />Victor, his best Marine buddy, insists the photo is Logan's lucky charm that will bring him good luck and he should carry it always. After winning poker games, surviving deadly battles, and then losing his closest friends, he returns home to Colorado with his lucky photo intact. Later, Logan cannot get the photo out of his mind and with his dog Zeus; he embarks on a adventurous cross country trek on foot to discover his destiny.<br /><br />During his travels he analyzes the photo and notices three extremely large pine trees in the background which lead him to Hampton, North Carolina where he meets Elizabeth Clayton and her son Ben. Elizabeth is the woman in the picture. Logan's secret of the photo stays with him during the beginnings of their relationship.<br /><br />Logan obtains work as a dog trainer for Elizabeth and her mother. He befriends Ben and replaces the father-son relationship which formerly had been with his real dad. This bond waned because Ben did not live up to the father's expectations of a jock, as he liked to play chess and the violin.<br /><br />As Thibault' s relationship turns to love, Elizabeth's ex-husband, Keith Clayton, the Sheriff of Hampton, interferes and manipulates their lives to his benefit. Conflict abounds in this love story with an exciting conclusion for these three main characters that invigorate the human heart. The Lucky One is a meaningful novel for the romantic in all of us which would make an inspiring movie.<br /><br />Clark Isaacs<br />Reviewergful novel for the romantic in all of us which would make an inspiring movie.

B000A1ENCU|2.0|This edition is very badly set up.  The scene index is uselss, and the whole thing is badly done.  The VHS of this was great.  The story lines are good and the acting is very good. The Amphitheater scenes are very moving. If you can get another copy that is not this one, it would be worth it to see this classic film
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I have enjoyed Bond movies, since my father and I used to watch them when I was a child.  My first Bond was Roger Moore in \\"Live and Let Die\\".  Roger used to be my favorite, until I was old enough to appreciate Sean Connery.  I was not sure what to expect with this new version of Casino Royale, as the first one was my least favorite Bond movie, if you can even call it that. The first Casino Royale was a spoof of spy movies, along the same line as the Goldmember movies.  I was very pleased with the new version of Casino Royale, and I especially like the \\"new\\" version of Bond.    This new era of Bond, takes us to the beginning of James Bond, as he makes his seemless transition from agent to special agent \\"007\\".  Daniel Craig has such a presence on screen as the present day Bond.  Strong, athletic, powerful, and ruthless.  Craig has the charm and intelligence to match wits with the various Bond villains, women, and of course M, played by the always impressive Judi Dench.  Some reviewers are critical of Craig's performance, but I found him believable and dangerous in taking on the challenges of Le Chiffre(Mads Mikkelsen), and the new mysterious organization that is funding terrorist groups around the World.  Bond's new romantic lead is British treasury official Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).  Eva has the beauty and quick wit to keep up with Bond throughout the film.  However, as the film plays, certain events transpire that may lead one to believe whose side Vesper is really on.    Casino Royale takes us all over the world to exotic locations, something we come to expect from Bond films.  In Casino, we visit Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas, and Montenegro for a high stakes poker game, with a 10 million buy-in.  The cinematography is excellent.  And I especially enjoyed the scenes of the construction site brawl and the floating house on a canal.  Watching this movie on Blu-ray was visually stunning, and the audio was outstanding.      Special Features on the DVD:  *  \\"BecomingBond\\" : Takes us from Ian Fleming's 1st spy novel, Casino      Royale, and the transition to film.  Also, how Daniel Craig was      casted as the 6th Bond actor.    *  \\"James Bond : For Real\\" : This segment showed how the various scenes      and their stunts were filmed.  The stuntmen definitely earned their     keep on this film, especially the driver who flipped 7 times during      the Ashton crash scene.  *  \\"Bond Girls Are Forever\\" : Ex-Bond girl Maryam D'Abo flies around the      World to interview some of the more popular Bond girls from Ursula     Andress to Halle Berry and in between.  *  \\"Chris Cornell Video\\" : featuring a video of the song played in the     opening credits.  *  \\"Previews\\" : Rocky Balboa, The Pursuit of Happiness, Stranger Than     Fiction.      Where is the trailer for the movie?  I am disappointed it is not on the DVD.      Casino Royale is definitely a great film in the James Bond library.  Great fights, great women, great locales, and a new, ruthless James Bond in Daniel Craig.  This franchise is in good hands.
B001DPHDCY|3.0|Faithful to the book, as well as the 70's TV movie, this new CGI presentation to me seems the best way to handle Geisel's work in this day and age. Made by the team that did Ice Age 1, 2, and soon 3, the scenery looks very well and retains the book's original drawings template through a modern 3D-like effect. Another bonus is when Horton daydreams of glory (twice), the animation takes a U-Turn towards the classic Dr Seuss cartoons to an 80's-ish Japanimation homage (and yes, it fits the movie). I only have two complaints: 1) the disc is barebones with just a commentary and a few trailers plus it's a one layer flipper with Wide and Full Frame. Doesn't Fox realize that kids' parents these days own 16:9 sets....be done with the Full Frame already and use that space for better things! And 2) even though the cast is all top-notch performers of today (how many movies does Seth Rogen need to be in in a row, huh?) everyone sounds so down-key it makes the movie less interesting. At times Horton needed a cup of Joe and why Carol Burnett was placed with a cast that half probably didn't know who she was seemed odd too. But it's a good movie that really brought the book to life without going too far into the real like \\"The Grinch\\" and \\"The Cat In The Hat\\" did. Worthy rental, but if your collection has those other two in it already, you better buy this one as well or your family's gonna hear about it too.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:7.5/10)
B000ATQYT2|2.0|VERY DISAPPOINTING  I love the missing song. I would really like an explanation - makes me want to return the movie. AS well as the LIE on the cover stating wide screen when it does not play wide screen.  What's wrong with Disney?  So upsetting to me...
B001DXS4E2|4.0|I had never seen this movie, and ordered it figuring I was going to get much of the same mindless, insipid musical entertainment that I love so much in White Christmas. I worked at a video store for several years, and every year at Christmas this one flew off the shelves-- judging from my shopping nowadays, it still does. If you're looking for realistic, hardcore plot, look elsewhere. Buy this movie for the music and the memories.<br /><br />This edition is a fantastic value for Holiday Inn fans, B&W purists, soundtrack lovers and collectors. First there is the film in the original B&W on one disc, with commentary, a retrospective of Crosby and Astaire, a \\"making of\\" feature on the song and dance numbers, original theatrical trailer and even audio commentary with archival audio from Crosby and Astaire. The second disc has a feature about colorizing Holiday Inn, as well as the colorized version of the movie. The colors are soft and easy on the eye, and I think it only makes the movie look that much more gorgeous. This is not the colorization from the early days of the process in the 80's! Last, it includes a CD with 12 songs from the movie, including White Christmas.<br /><br />The one caveat I would bring to your attention is the blackface number that begins about 43 minutes into the movie. It begins with Crosby applying blackface makeup to Virginia Dale, and culminates with a song about how Abraham Lincoln freed the \\"darkies.\\" I am not making this up. I had no idea something like this was in the movie, and I had to scrape my jaw off the floor at the conclusion. While I believe that things like this ought to be preserved in their original form, those of you who haven't seen this should be aware that it's in there. I watch movies on my iPod as I'm out and about with my laptop, and I would have hated to be watching that scene for the first time in public, not knowing that it was coming.<br /><br />That said, I fail to see how this movie is superior to its \\"twin,\\" White Christmas. The plot is about the same, and you get a lot of great musical numbers in between. If you like White Christmas, if you love this period of history, or if you love musicals, make sure you buy this edition. I know I am enjoying mine!s about the same, and you get a lot of great musical numbers in between. If you like White Christmas, if you love this period of history, or if you love musicals, make sure you buy this edition. I know I am enjoying mine!
0143038419|4.0|I find it utterly confounding that so many reviewers had a problem with this book. Many see the author as vapid and selfish but that is the point of the book! I believe that many reviewers have problems with trying to digest this book as something religious or full of spiritual enlightenment.    Gilbert is highly admirable in her \\"glorious\\" selfishness, horniness, eagerness to experience life sans the day-to-day blahs. The reviewers who find this dissatisfying may themselves be encumbered in kids, work, chores, husbands, etc. But Gilbert bucks the picket fence trend and decides that this is not her destiny; she seizes the opportunity to challenge herself to create a European identity void of all the traditional architecture of the American woman-guilt, compromise, sacrifice, lack of whimsy and emptied feelings of beauty and desire.    If you look closely this book is vaguely a slice of a \\"Sex and the City\\" episode...a Samantha-of-sorts, Gilbert gives her lackluster life lots of polish in this frank and funny tribute to female rogues everywhere.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This  Guns 'n Roses  CD  is great. I love it. My top 2 favorite songs are \\"Welcome to the jungle\\" and \\"Sweet child 'o mine\\". And I like this CD because it  ROCKS!
B00000IUT7|5.0|I have read the other reviews. I dont' know if we are just lucky or if things have changed with this train. We have had this train for several years now. It has been a sturdy long lasting train. This is one of the go to train engines in our train building/playing.<br /><br />It will pull other train pieces up hills and around corners. It will not pull up a lot of pieces but four or five it will pull behind him without any problem. We have found it helps to build your train on a sold piece of ground (like the kitchen tiled floor). We have also found it will not take overly sharp corners like some of the fancier pieces that you can buy will make. However, we rarely have problems and my kids love this train piece.<br /><br />The one negative- it eats batteries like crazy.<br /><br />Enjoy.
0312427999|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not in any way anti-capitalist.  I work in the private sector, I have an MBA, and I believe that markets work.  The Shock Doctrine is also not anti-capitalist, as many of the author's critics have claimed.      The Shock Doctrine is a groundbreaking and eye-opening account of the manner in which the brand of supposedly free-market capitalism we see today - manifested in the housing crisis and the current economic meltdown - has propagated throughout the world. It details extensively that - contrary to popular mythology - laissez-faire doctrine did not spread because it has triumphed fairly in the marketplace of ideas and demonstrated that it is good for the many. Rather, it has too often been imposed through stealth, extortion and exploitation, and more often than not, for the benefit of the few.    The result of this corporatism - in literally every case - has been widespread disenfranchisement, massive increases in poverty and unemployment, the destruction of shared wealth, and the tremendous enrichment of a very few. It is a legacy of shame, coercion and hypocrisy that provides a telling insight into the tension between developed and developing nations, and one with which every American who doesn't understand why the rest of the world doesn't love us unconditionally needs to become intimately familiar.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|At first when I saw the cover I wasn't so motivated. I am not such a fan of these historical movies but this one was incredible! It made me cry and it moved me and touched me. The story is so engaging everything is perfect. I have classified it as my favorite movie, what more can I say?!
B00005QW5X|5.0|I have probably a dozen different reviews of this movie in various stages of completion on my computer. The problem is that I keep trying to say everything I want to say about it, and there just isn't enough time or space in this world for it all.    I saw Hedwig live many times at the Jane Street Theatre in NYC. I loved her so much there that I refused to see the movie for many years. Not until after I'd seen Shortbus on DVD in the summer of 2008 did I go back and watch Hedwig, to see if it could possibly be as bad as Shortbus was. Not only was it not, it was so GOOD that it made Shortbus even more inexplicable.    I'm not going to go into all the details of why I love Hedwig so much. Stephen Trask's songs are just marvelous, as they always were, and the added movie score is great; John Cameron Mitchell and Michael Pitt are wonderful in the two lead roles (Mitchell's crazed Hedwig dancing and his extreme closeups singing straight into the camera get to me especially; Pitt is perfect as Tommy and does the best lip-syncing ever); and I can't even begin to say what an unbelievably brilliant job Mitchell has done in bringing Hedwig to the screen.    I never imagined I'd say this, but the movie is BETTER than the live show. It's more accessible, human, touching, moving, beautiful, and on and on and on. I watch it over and over, and it gets richer and more fun and more rewarding every time. I'm very grateful to Mitchell, Trask and everybody else involved for creating Hedwig, and then for making her available anywhere, everywhere, forever.    Thank you, guys! You did a good job.
B0009MAO46|4.0|all i have to say is that its a classic and if you have never seen it do yourself a favor and buy the DVD
1595141979|5.0|I love the VA series and Shadow Kiss is even better and bigger than the first two! Also sadder, as Rose grows up and is faced with difficult decisions and tragedy. Sometimes I miss the old, fun Rose, but the character development is well-written and logical. After this book, I think the VAseries will go into an entirely different direction and I can't wait!! Please write really fast, Richelle!
B00005JPS8|5.0|Everyone knows it. It's no secret. Iron Man filled our superhero needs. Being that he is one of the rare international heroes who fights in more places than just NEW YORK makes him a little more noble than the others. Tony Stark is easily one of the coolest characters with and without the suit, considering his fast remarks and big attitude. It's a must see, must have, hands down.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|If you did not see this movie YOU ARE MISSING  a good action movie. And even if you saw it at the theater you will still want to get this movie.   I cannot emphasize enough how important is to watch this movie with your surround system ON and LOUD. One of the best features of this movie is the music. It creates the mood, suspense, excitement. the scenes are pretty clean. there is a couple of bad words, literally. Overall a very clean, blood free movie. PARENTS: watch this movie first and make sure that you are OK with your children watching it. I think it is a good movie, it requires some parental guidance but at the end YOU are the parents and you know better.
B001FOPODS|2.0|I hoped to make it as a gift to teach a youngster about instruments of the orchestra. Very little emphasis is placed on instruments and their role in character development. The story line is revisionist from the original. Hunters are militaristic, mean and ineffective. The duck is a meal for the wolf and never rescued. The wolf is not shot by the hunters, but rescued and placed in a game preserve. I found it to be an overall disappointment!
141694737X|5.0|Bought for my 15 month old, for a plane trip.  He was delighted by each page, the repetitive wording was simple enough for him to enjoy as I read to him.  Growled at the lion, laughed at the monkey.  With time, the lift-the-flaps have broken in enough for him to open w/o help.  Cardboard flaps are fairly sturdy, although will bend and tear if your toddler is enthusiastic about books.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|Though this senario in the movie happened back in the late Carter or early Reagan Presidencies, It could happen any day now. Americans, as a majority, are totally unprepared and unaware of the seriousness of our present day situation on a global scale. The destruction shown in the movie, IS NOT indicative of the real horror that will be when the US is hit with atomic weapons. This movie is a fictional senario of what will happen in the fairly near future and was fairly well made. It is a must see. Russia's Putin is, today, preparing for this very thing, coming to pass, along with his buddies in Iran, Syria and most of the muslum countries.    Lyle Braae
B0017VG69U|4.0|I've only watched about 1/2 dozen episodes, but so far I've been relatively pleased. I bought the HD-DVD version of the first season, and to be honest, I can't see much difference between that and this season (standard dvd). Only negative is in the way they redid the ship's phaser shots - to me it looks a little hokey.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout video. I have been on Level 1 for two weeks. I plan to try Level 2 in another week. I am getting a great workout on Level 1. It is worth it to get this DVD, because there are three levels (and Level 1 is pretty hard for a fit person in her thirties). I started with 5 lb weights and had to go get some 3lb weights because some of the moves were hard.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I am 30 yrs old 14 weeks into my pregnancy. 5'1 114 lbs. Before purchasing a dvd workout for my pregnancy i read the reviews on some of them, especially the higher ratings one. Regardless of the 4 stars this video recieved I purchased it. I am so immensely excited over this video. Not only does it make me feel great its easy despite what other reviewers mentioned. Before my pregnancy I excercised, typical treadmil, no marathons or climbing Mt. Everest. I was able to finish this dvd without panting or fainting! I pop this in 3-4 times a week. I highly recommend this video to keep you in shape and raise your energy levels.
B001C46P2A|2.0|Take \\"Out of Africa,\\" \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" \\"Far, Far Away,\\" and \\"How the West Was Won,\\" throw them in a food processor, run on blend for a minute and you will have this dull, cliche ridden and limp epic. I counted at least thirty lines of dialogue in this movie that were stolen from other films (\\"Just because I am a woman doesn't mean I'm not as capable as a man.\\" \\"Without love, you have nothing.\\" etc.). When the film isn't spitting out one visual or verbal cliche after another, it's inflicting one of the most annoyingly precocious child actors in the history of film on the audience. At one point, it appears that the aborigine boy (who serves as the voice over narrator!) has been shot. I yelled out, \\"Thank god he's dead finally!\\"   Nicole Kidman does her usual ice princess routine here - is she acting or was it all of those scientological counseling sessions? Hugh Jackman takes off his shirt and shows us he is a hunk. Of course, they hate each other at first but this is the movies and - SURPRISE! - they end up falling in love. There's just one problem, though. Outside of being the only two attractive people in that area of the outback (the aborigine women look like  - well, primates), there's absolutely no reason for these two to be together. Must have been desperate lust.  You won't give a darn about Kidman getting her cattle to market in time to save her ranch. You just won't care. You won't care if the annoying child actor becomes a servant of the elite or is allowed to run off with his grandfather. You won't give a darn about that either. At the end of this bloated and sophomoric attempt at an epic movie, you will only care that you have wasted three hours of your life.  Added note: the movie tries to make us believe that the aborigines can do magic. I find the suggestion that native peoples have supernatural powers or knowledge that \\"white\\" people have lost because they are \\"civilized\\" to be absurd. If you want to see magic, go to Florida and watch the space shuttle take off. Forget about the wackos who think that aborigines can stop cattle from stampeding with ESP. I wish those \\"white\\" people who pine away for native shamanic knowledge would strip off their clothes and run off with these savages and see just what kind of harsh lives these people live. Since the average life span of these people is usually 30 or so (I guess all of that supposed magic isn't helping them too much with life extension.), we could cull humanity of these New Age nutjobs pretty quickly.

0312370849|2.0|The back of the book intrigued me: a story of a young French Jew who hides her brother as their family is rounded up during the Holocaust, and the 21st century journalist who stumbles across the girl's story and is compelled to find out its ending.    The book, however, is a major disappointment.  The author's handling of the events, both the horrific historic ones and those in the present day, is ham-handed.  The first half of the book is told in alternating chapters between the child Sarah (although the child's name isn't revealed until much later; an odd device, given that the child's name is in the book title) and the journalist Julia.  Sarah's story is harrowing, but even the horror of it is masked by the amateur writing.      Once Sarah's voice is no longer to be found in the book, the amateur writing becomes even more comical.  We watch Julia go through a mid-life crisis that has been written by more able authors before, and finally settle into a life that fits her better.    The ideas that the book puts forth are challenging: what did the French know as the Jews were rounded up? why did they ignore their part in the Holocaust for so long? what culpability is there for a population that let such horrors happen?  Had the author addressed those questions, this could have been a great novel.  Instead, it's bad chick lit with a side of even worse historical fiction.
0545128285|5.0|Though I enjoyed the individual stories very much, I think what really made the book was Dumbledore's footnotes. Those brought me back to the great feeling of what it is to be a Harry Potter fan. I particularly loved his comments about members of the Malfoy family, and the woman who was too sensitive for some of Beedle's tales, Blaxum I think the name was. The illustrations are also surprisingly good, considering they were done by Rowling. I knew she could draw to an extent, I just didn't know what that extent was.<br />I'll probably be reading these to my kids more often than Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. Beedle's stories are so short, yet I already prefer them simply because of the subtle message they would to little girls as opposed to the message Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty might send.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|The only calamity here is the dumba$$ so-called fans of the Smashing Pumpkins who can't seem to 'grow up' like the band has.  I'm sorry 'Today' was so special to you that time has to stand still for ya. But 'Today' was 15 years ago and things have moved on. The fan kiddy tantrums are tedious. Grow up.    And I love the dude who admits the first five tracks are 'killer', then proceeds to give Zeitgeist 2 stars (as if it some Jessica Simpson record) and trashes it because, among other gripes, D'arcy and Iha are absent.  D'arcy was a mediocre bassist with lousy rhythm and Iha didn't play ANY of the guitar parts on their records. He was in actuality just a touring guitarist.    It was always Corgan and his muse Chamberlain. That was the Pumpkins.    I remember well the fallout the band had with these 'fans' because Billy put out Adore in '98. It was a great sounding record, period. But because you couldn't understand it, you actually killed the Pumpkins through betrayal. Oh how the backs turned on them because of Adore.    So again, the only group that deserves these 1 and 2 star ratings are the candya$$ fans who wish Billy would write 1979 over and over and over again. Get a life.
0143142356|2.0|Granted I just finished listening to all six audio books of Davina Porter's read of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series- which was absolutely wonderful.  This particular reader is just that a reader.  Don't expect great enthusiasm or he taking on various characters voices.  I am a fan of Ken Follett; however, I wanted more from I was listening to.  I did enjoy the story, a good sequal; yet, I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth more.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|One of the best movies of the year and unquestionably the best Batman ever.  This was Heath Ledger's ninth symphony and a final tribute to this great actor.  However, the theme of never letting the bad guy die because you are better than him is flawed thinking and is permeated throughout the movie.  I know they need to keep the Joker around for another sequel but him surviving is just intolerable and it's like a piece of sand in your eye at the end of the movie.  There is no justice at the end, and this is the hardest thing about the story line.  It leaves a very black and dark story in your mind.

B001FB55Y4|1.0|Instead of showing us who the characters are and what they are like, Ritchie insists on telling us--via voiceover narration for the first 20 minutes of the movie--which winds us being a complete bore.  Not only that, it was one of the most confusing movies I have seen in a while.  I was never really sure who was doing what and why.  I mean, why were the Russians after Gerard Butler?  Why was everyone after the painting?  Let me just say, Ritchie is no Quentin Tarantino.

1439102813|5.0|This beautiful debut novel from Lisa Genova is exceptionally moving in its portrayal of early onset Alzheimer's disease, and is at once riveting, poignant, heartbreaking, terrifying.  With her credentials, Ms. Genova is highly qualified to speak about the effects of Alzheimer's, both for the patient and the patient's loved ones and caregivers.  An unusual approach, her novel looks at this debilitating disease through the eyes of Alice, a victim of EOAD, and through her eyes we gain a greater appreciation of the random cruelty this disease imparts on its victims.<br /><br />Alice's disease begins with small lapses in memory which she attributes to stress and menopause, but her symptoms grow more severe in a joltingly brief amount of time.  These maddening lapses in memory begin to rob her of who she, what she knows, the very essence of herself.  Her disorientation grows.  She frustratingly alternates between bewildering states of confusion and perfectly lucid moments.  We see her anguish at having to leave behind an accomplished career.  She mistakes the utility closet for a bathroom, the black hallway rug for a hole in the floor, the microwave's beep for the telephone and doorbell.  Flashes of frustrated anger begin to pepper her personality.  We feel her terror in this moving account told through Alice's eyes.<br /><br />Rarely have I been so deeply affected by a fictional character, maybe because I have older people in my life, maybe not.  This compassionate depiction of Alice's terrifying descent into Alzheimer's would resonate with anyone who has an open heart and empathetic nature.  I think of Alice and her family often, as well as the thousands across the country like them.  Quite simply, this is one of the best and most unique books I have read in a very long time.  Rated: 6 stars.

0671027344|5.0|This is not The Catcher In the Rye.  That is a good thing.  Every story should be able to own itself and not come across as the newest, revamped model of a well loved book that was written decades ago.<br /><br />This the heartbreaking story of a brilliant, emotionally stunted, socially inept, well-meaning, sweet boy.  It's a story told from his point of view in a series of letters to stranger.  For those who find the writing stilted, the main character flawed, the story unbelievable, or the likelihood of such a boy having any friends: I urge you to think of this not only as a novel, but one that is voiced by an eccentric and naive freshman.  For me, the very characteristics of this book that cause it to come under fire are the same ones that cause me to have nothing but praise for it.  Not every freshman is a poet.  Not every freshman is socially adept to the world. It is not the case that a boy will always \\"get\\" girls.  Everyone starts somewhere; our protagonist just starts a little farther back.<br /><br />Charlie is a fascinating character to me.  The voice through which all events in the book are depicted, he is emotionally vacant; yet unaware of his own limitations.  This leads to an interesting narration of events.  He can tell that a character is happy or sad, but it is hard for him to really grasp the \\"why\\" behind the actions he observes.<br /><br />Chobosky created a character who tells us two stories: the one he voices and the one we can imagine from the other characters' prospective. Because we are not as naive as Charlie, because we have loved and lost, we can groan at what Charlie is missing in the moments he describes.  We know why it doesn't work out with some girl or why his siblings fight.  He is the straight man telling a funny joke and a sad, sad tale.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|Based upon comic book and graphic novel writer Neil Gaiman's original story, [[ASIN:0061689246 \\"Stardust\\"]] is a charming fantasy film with a humorous twist. Much like [[ASIN:0156035219 \\"The Princess Bride\\"]] in its combination of romance, adventure, comedy, and fantasy, \\"Stardust\\" is a remarkable film with a lot of heart. The film was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who had been eager to adapt the story for the cinematic medium. Thankfully Vaughn was a more than competent director and he had a great deal of respect for the source material. It should also be noted that Vaughn had directed primarily low-budget, critically acclaimed crime dramas and that he was unused to the pressures of making a commercially successful film of this scale. And yet he has succeeded in creating an entertaining movie.  The film is relatively faithful to the novel, and yet it stands out as a separate entity. All of Gaiman's charm and wit are retained, while screenwriters Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn add a contemporary edge to the fractured fairy tale.  The story begins with a young peasant boy named Tristan as he tries to win the heart of the vapid damsel, Victoria. One night while sitting under the starlit sky, Tristan and Victoria watch as a falling star plummets to Earth. As a token of his love, Tristan offers to retrieve the fallen star for Victoria, but to do so he must cross the forbidden wall that borders their small English village. After crossing the wall, Tristan discovers that he's entered a bizarre world of magical enchantment. When Tristan finds the fallen star, he's shocked to see that on this side of the wall it has taken the form of a beautiful young woman named Yvaine. Yvaine says that she was struck by a bewitched necklace that was speeding through outer space and that it knocked her to Earth. The necklace, it turns out, is a precious heirloom belonging to the dead King of Stormhold Castle. The King's sons have killed each other in order to succeed their father as the newking, but now only the good Prince Primus and the devious Prince Septimus remain. The two rival princes must race each other to the necklace before either can ascend to the throne.  Meanwhile, Lamia, the Queen of the Witches, seeks the heart of a star, which she plans to eat so that her youth and beauty will be restored. Lamia, too, soon sets out on a journey and she uses her mystical powers to slow Tristan and Yvaine down. As Tristan and Yvaine elude the evil prince Septimus and Queen Lamia, they take refuge in the flying pirate ship of the seemingly fearsome Captain Shakespeare. It's not long before Tristan and Yvaine come to realize that they love one another, but can they overcome the many obstacles that stand in the way of their happiness? And can Tristan, an ordinary peasant boy, prove himself to be a courageous hero or shall he falter at the cost of Yvaine's life and his own true destiny?  Despite the film's predictable ending and the cliché fantasy themes, Stardust is really quite dazzling. The film shines with dazzling action, witty dialogue, and a perfect cast. The cast includes Charlie Cox as Tristan, Claire Danes as Yvaine, Michelle Pfeiffer as Lamia, Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare, Sienna Miller as Victoria, Peter O'Toole as The King, Mark Strong as Septimus, Jason Flemyng as Primus, and Ian McKellen, who voices the narrator. Newcomer Charlie Cox captures the spirit of his awkward hero nicely and Michelle Pfeiffer is deliciously evil as the Queen of the Witches. My only complaint regarding the cast of the film has to do with Claire Danes. While there's nothing wrong with her feisty portrayal of Yvaine, I found her heavily plucked eyebrows to be very distracting and they gave her an unintentionally eerie appearance. But this is minor.  The DVD includes \\"Good Omens: The Making of Stardust\\" documentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, the theatrical trailer and previews.

B00005JPNY|3.0|WARNING: This review may contain spoilers!    I suppose it's not surprising, what with the current trend of adapting fantasy literature into films, that Philip Pullman's novel [[ASIN:0375838309 The Golden Compass]] should become a major motion picture. What is surprising is who ended up writing the screenplay and directing the film. Chris Weitz, best known as one of the producers of the [[ASIN:B0009ZE9VW American Pie]] films, seems an odd choice to adapt the epic fantasy story for the silver screen and yet his commercial success gave New Line Cinema the courage to greenlight the project.  Adapting Philip Pullman's novel proved to be a daunting task and though much of the more controversial subject matter within the plot has been omitted, the film is fairly faithful to the conceit of the book. But the film suffers from a lack of thematic depth, which can be attributed to the removal of the book's religious and political commentary.  It should also be noted that the film ends in an abrupt and emotionally unsatisfying manner. Apparently this is because the studio was not confident that the film would be successful and they didn't wish to end the film with a cliffhanger.    The story, which is set in a universe parallel to our own where people's souls take on the physical form of animals called dæmons, follows a feisty and rebellious young girl named Lyra Belacqua, an orphan who lives at Jordon College in England. After a series of widespread kidnappings Lyra half-jokingly promises to rescue her best friend Roger if he is ever kidnapped. Little does she suspect that such a thing will actually happen.  When Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel, makes a visit to the college to announce a startling discovery in the Far North, Lyra has no idea of the far-reaching implications. Lord Asriel has discovered a connection between the mystical substance Dust and the divisions that separate parallel worlds. This controversial revelation places both he and Lyra under the watchful eye of the Magisterium, a vast totalitarian government, which uses religion to subjugate the masses. But all is changed when the beautiful and authoritative Mrs. Coulter invites Lyra to join her at her home and then journey with her to the Far North.  Before her departure, Lyra is given a tremendous gift from the Master of the College, who bestows unto her an alethiometer (or Golden Compass). The alethiometer has the power to tell the truth to anyone who can read its symbols.  At first Lyra relishes the attention and the luxuries that Mrs. Coulter showers upon her, but then Lyra begins to see a controlling, manipulative side to her new guardian. One night Lyra and her dæmon Pan come across a list of children's names and to her shock, she finds Roger's name is on the list. She then realizes that Mrs. Coulter is behind the kidnappings. Lyra runs away, but she is pursued by sinister agents. Luckily she is rescued by Gyptians, a nomadic people, who are seeking revenge on the Magisterium.  Learning to read the alethiometer, Lyra soon realizes that a great destiny is set upon her. She meets and befriends an Armoured Bear named Iorek Byrnison, a beautiful witch named Serafina Pekkala, and an aeronaut named Lee Scoresby. Lyra continues her travels north, and along with her new allies, overcomes many perils including savage Armoured Bears, and soldiers.  Yet nothing can prepare Lyra for what she finds in the Far North. There she learns what became of the kidnapped children and the horrible truth about Mrs. Coulter. In the end Lyra and her companions must face the power of the Magisterium, and either succeed in freeing their world and all others from its tyrannical grasp or die trying.    The film features a spectacular cast including Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, and Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala. The film also features Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, and the voices of Ian McKellen, Freddie Highmore, and Kathy Bates. The entire cast is superb especially the young Dakota Blue Richards, whose portrayal of plucky heroine Lyra has unfairly been overlooked by most critics.  The Golden Compass, which is the first part in a trilogy, failed to become a hit in the U.S., so it's questionable whether or not the next two books in the series shall ever be adapted into films. Sadly, this means that the adventures of Lyra (at least cinematically) are left without an ending. This certainly detracts from the enjoyment of watching the film, but perhaps there is still hope that the next two books will be given a cinematic treatment and thus provide viewers with a sense of closure.  It's unfortunate that the film was a Box office disappointment and that we may never find out how Lyra's adventures come to their end, but there are reasons for the film's poor reception from audiences. One of those reasons is New Line's overly ambitious and foolhardy marketing strategy. In the very first trailer they dared to make a comparison between this film and the beloved [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]]. This in itself was like committing Box Office suicide. Another reason for the film's failure to attract large audiences is the controversial thematic materials of the books. A major theme of Philip Pullman's books is that of rebelling against authority and religious dogma. Cleverly (and some would say subversively) exploiting taboos within Judaeo-Christian beliefs, Pullman weaves a tale of redemption, not through a higher power but through the power of the self. As a result the Catholic Church boycotted the film, deeming it heretical in its content.  Overall, The Golden Compass is an admirable yet deeply flawed epic. Though it features a strong cast and gorgeous visual effects, these can also be found in the [[ASIN:B001DPHDIS Harry Potter]] and [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA The Chronicles of Narnia]] series. What really hurts the film is the inexperience of its writer/director and the lackof faith that the studio placed in him. It's ironic, but ultimately the film about a Golden Compass finds itself lost.

B001H5X7I4|5.0|I'm so embarrassed to say this but I love this movie so much, just bloody love it. I cannot even remember when something made me laugh so hard that I kept going back and watching certain scenes over and over. Robert Downey Jr.'s comeback is complete. As a 'black dude', he just nails it and never lets go. Believe me, you get over feeling weird about it immediatly, it's just too good, too freakin' authentic and hilarious- but NOT disrespectful. He's so good, so perfect. And JB...When Jack Black is `in character' in character, his New York accent literally made me cry. The skinny guy with the guts hanging out, hilarious, Hamlet 2, hilarious, just everything comes together perfectly. Nick Nolte? Nick Nolte?!     And it's all due to Ben Stiller who literally took every bit of his successes (Zoolander) and failures (Heartbreak Kid) and created this just absolutely pitch perfect comedy. It's been so long since I could say that a movie made me pee my pants with delight. Thank you, Ben Stiller, for the gleeful humiliation. I'm glad I was it at home in front of my Sony BRAVIA KDL-46XBR6 46\\" LCD TV when it happened. Yep, Mother Nature's not the only one who pissed her pantsuite.    Just one bad thing, Tom Cruise was creepy. Normally, I don't mind him too bad but in this movie, he was creepy and not fun creepy, just creepy. I think Stiller thought it would be fun to have him being so outrageous and yeah, it's fun but it pushed the creepy envelope for me. Tom Cruise is just creepy for me and I just think he's, well, creepy.
038534273X|2.0|Well, this book was quite disappointing.    At first, I liked how the author was able to tell the story and how he has connected the pieces together, but he has perpetrated huge mistakes like, for example, forgetting how some first generation googlers were vital to the success of the company.    I am talking of people like Eric Veach, who created the algorithms for AdWords, Jeff Dean, who  created important infrastructure tools, Paul Buchheit, the Gmail creator and many, many other googlers. Fortunately, Craig Silverstein and Craig Nevill-Manning were not forgotten but the author barely mention their names.    Did you know that the \\"Don't be evil\\" motto was created by Paul Buchheit and Avid Pattel? Well, this fact is totally ignored by the author! If you read the book it will look like it was created by Brin and Page. Even Wikipedia is more accurate than this book.

0545128285|1.0|This book is a collection of short stories.  Not one of them has the creativity or the ability to generate the excitement of the Harry Potter series.  I was very disappointed in the book.  The stories are not up to the J.K. Rowling standards as established in the Harry Potter series!
6304493681|3.0|I'm not usually a big fan of anime, sure, I was into it for a year or two but after that it wasn't a real draw.  Revisiting Ghost in the Shell however, I was surprised to find that I actually liked it more than the first time around.  Maybe it's because I can appreciate the philosophical and psychological ideas presented or maybe it's because I have a more experienced eye for what makes good cinematography.<br /><br />Philosophically this definitely isn't the deepest examination of the concepts of self, sentience and life but it's very effective in the way it presents these questions and it doesn't try to hand you any answers in gift wrapping like many similar films.<br /><br />From a cinematography and animation standpoint it certainly is one of the best of it's kind in the genre of anime and rivals many of the best western 2D and 3D animation in that sense.  In particular, I think it's great edit, very effective music and superb camera shots shine so vividly.<br /><br />However, I don't actually feel like the narrative of the story is particularly good, the pacing is okay but I never really felt like I identified with the characters--which I think is really important for this film--and I certainly didn't believe they could be real.  I'm often a fan of movies leaving things wide open but this one didn't even feel like there was any ending, maybe it was just it's short length.<br /><br />Ghost in the Shell is a shining example of an anime that I think transcended the genre, but I'm not sure I would really want to sit through it again.
B001F12J48|1.0|If you already have this movie please  don't buy this one just for the 3D effect! Its awful!  The people all have extra eyes, ect and gives you a major  headache to watch! The only things that was even a little bit 3D  were the snowflakes, a cup in the hot chocolate scene, and the ticket when its flying in the air. Don't waste your money on it!
0316066524|5.0|I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace, a once-in-a-generation artist who, unfortunately for the rest of us, recently committed suicide. His death hit me surprisingly hard, considering I'd never met the man. As a personal tribute, I picked up his masterpiece again for a third read.<br /><br />It's a sprawling work of genius, hysterically sad and tragically funny, about the pursuit of happiness and the difficulties of communication. Set in a near future world where the years are corporate-sponsored and America handles its garbage by catapulting it onto land we forced Canada to accept as a \\"gift,\\" the novel is too big and brilliant to be summed up. All I can say is that if the length (1079 pages) and complexity (scores of characters, 100 pages of footnotes, deeply recursive language) don't scare you, then reading it can change the way you think about fiction. It's not everybody's taste, but it thoroughly blows my mind.<br /><br />Rest in peace, brother.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm reading through the other reviews ... especially the 1 star reviews and I think it's very funny that most of them are sci-fi fans and the things they say they don't like about Firefly.    Like they love Star Trek and then they gripe about how Firefly is so unrealistic.  Because finding bipedal, English-speaking aliens on planets that all have the proper atmospheric conditions for humans is extremely realistic.  Or they like Battlestar Gallactica but complain that Firefly is too melodramatic.  Please.      Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Star Trek growing up and I like Battlestar Gallactica, but I LOVE Firefly.  I love that it's about space but it's not about aliens or killer robots.  I love that it's about the people trying to scrape by instead of the people in the inner circle.  I love that it's real guns instead of ray guns, that they eat processed food, that they wear regular clothes, and have the same issues we all struggle with.      It is an original take on space shows, it barely falls into the sci-fi category.  The language, the look, even the way they have handled all the special effects shots is unique.  The acting is terrific, the stories are great...    Now for the people who watched 2 episodes and turned it off, you didn't give it a chance.  Me personally, I say you have to get to disk 3 in the set before the show gets really awesome.  But most people I've shown it to were hooked after the first episode.    This show deserves the 5 star reviews it's gotten.  The only thing that would make it lose stars is it was cut prematurely short by the network.
B001C46P2A|4.0|Baz Luhrmann has done with Australia what David O. Selznick managed to do with DUEL IN THE SUN--he's created a sprawling epic of a canvas for a narrow storyline about a woman who needs a man to keep the villains from double-crossing her in a land deal. It's the kind of story every B-western had in the old days, usually with someone like Roy Rogers or Gene Autry playing the cowboy who helps a girl keep her ranch from the outlaws who want it. Here the tale has been expanded to include racial overtones (which DUEL also had) and some good cattle drive scenes that teeter into cliff hanging territory.<br /><br />Of course, he's added bits of Australian history to the background of the story--such as the treatment of Aborigines whom the villain of the piece calls \\"creamies\\" and a World War II sequence of Japanese bombing an island off Australia and heading for Darwin. No expense has been spared to make these scenes look very realistic. For production values alone, it deserves a 7.<br /><br />A sensitive looking boy named BRANDON WALTERS is effective as the boy Nullah whom Kidman comes to love as her own son. Unfortunately, the scenes between Kidman and Walters are clumsily handled by the actress who seems to be forcing herself on the characterization of a woman uncertain of herself when relating to children. Her \\"Over the Rainbow\\" moment seems unauthentic.<br /><br />HUGH JACKMAN is great as the cowboy called Drover who is assigned to escort the British born Lady Ashley (NICOLE KIDMAN) on a cattle drive where she intends to get a handsome sum for her cattle. DAVID WENHAM makes an excellent villain as the man who opposes Kidman and Jackman all through the story, getting his comeuppance as all good villains eventually do.<br /><br />The sheer predictability of the tale is what hurts it most. We all know that Jackman and Kidman will be locking lips long before the fadeout and that Wenham will make a nasty exit. What we can't foresee is that the story will drift in all sorts of directions about racial inequalities and weird rituals with a bit of World War II bombings thrown in.<br /><br />The casting of the leads hurts the story. Jackman is fine and has obviously buffed up for the role but Kidman is the wrong actress for the part, unable to summon the sort of temperamental display that someone like Kate Winslet was able to do with the role of Rose in TITANIC. A stronger actress would have been a better choice.<br /><br />However, having said all this, there are plenty of gripping moments in \\"Australia\\" that make you wonder why the film isn't doing as well as it should at the box-office. For all of its faults, it's still more engrossing than many films that bring in larger crowdslities and weird rituals with a bit of World War II bombings thrown in.

0439813786|5.0|Dear Reader,                                             I recommend this book to anyone who likes a realistic book. Hugo Cabret is a twelve-year-old boy who loves to invent things. His father died in a fire, no one knows how the fire got started and from then on he lived with his drunken uncle in a clock tower. Hugo's uncle keeps the clock towers working, and one day he left and never came back. Hugo never said anything to anyone about his uncle leaving. He made the clock towers work and took his checks in the mail (even though he didn't know how to cash them) Hugo took clothes from the lost and found in the building with the clock tower in it and he pays with money he finds on the streets of Paris.                                  The Invention of Hugo Cabret is the best book I've ever read because I love realistic books, and it has amazing pictures by Brian Selznick. You should read it!

075640407X|4.0|The Name of the Wind is a very good story. It is not by any means ground-breaking fantasy, however. The book is the first in a projected trilogy, and tells the story of an extraordinarily precocious boy whose family is killed and then goes out to seek the wrongdoers. Pretty standard. Any fan of fantasy knows, though, that plot is only one small part of the magic. Most of the artistry lies in characters and in world-building.    The Name of the Wind is told mainly in the first person, which is a departure from the norm for the genre. Through this narrative format, we learn a great deal about the main character, Kvothe- the way his mind works, his feelings and his reasoning- but we get very little insight into the other characters. I like the first person narrative as future-Kvothe seems to be a pretty fascinating person. However, teenage-Kvothe is the main character in the story, and he can get a bit tiring. Hopefully he does some quick maturing in the next couple of books. It wasn't that he was unlikable at all. He was just such a teenager- sometimes so cocky and arrogant and rude for no purpose, and sometimes so completely the opposite that you'd think he was a different person. But it says a lot about Rothfuss that he captured the age of his character so well!    The world-building aspect of the novel is where it fell just a little short for me, and I think this is due to the first-person narrative. We are limited to knowing only what Kvothe knows and sees and hears, and so we have no real scope of how large the world he lives in is or who the major players in it are. I only know what Kvothe decides to tell me. This can be extremely frustrating, but it also means that there may be many more interesting stories and folklore shared in the coming books- I hope so! What I have seen and heard of Kvothe's world is intriguing so far, but it is impossible to put together any of the parts into a cohesive structure. Meaning- I read the story and was interested by it, but Iam not entirely certain that I know what it is even about.    That said, I'm very happy to hear that the next installment in the series will be published in April so that I can continue learning about Kvothe and his world and his friends. I have a feeling the series will be one that holds my interest while I read it, though I am not quite sure if it is destined for my keeper shelf.    **A small but real annoyance with this book is that there are several typos.  I have a third edition of the Daw hardcover and there were many errors in it, which I found annoying and unnecessary.  I hope Daw cleans them up.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|\\"Dexter\\" never disappoints! As a big fan of the show, I was concerned how Season 3 would play out now that one of my favorite characters, James Doakes, is out of the picture. I never should have worried, because the third season of \\"Dexter\\" was just as fabulous as the first two. This season mainly focuses on Dexter's (Michael C. Hall) personal relationships. He's working through some major issues with his deceased father, Harry (James Remar), and his relationship with Rita (Julie Benz) takes a surprising turn when she announces that she's pregnant with Dexter's child. All of these emotions cause Dexter to turn to an unlikely person...Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), who takes a liking to Dexter and makes it his personal mission to become Dexter's BFF. No one is more surprised by this than Dexter, who discovers that he has more in common with Miguel than he possibly imagined. For the first time in his life, Dexter has a friend whom he can rely on and share (some) of his dirty little secrets with. After a while, however, Dexter realizes that there's much more to Miguel than he originally thought, and decides that the ADA may not be BFF material after all.<br /><br />This is a great season chock full of twists, turns, and excitement. In addition to Dexter's storyline, there are great subplots involving a new serial killer (\\"The Skinner\\"), Deborah's (Jennifer Carpenter) relationship with a CI, Angel's (David Zayas) recovery from his divorce, and Maria's (Lauren Velez) coping with the death of her former partner in Season 2. I am always impressed by the way this series constantly surprises its audience and keeps evolving these dynamic characters. The whole concept of Dexter making a friend was so simple, and yet carried the entire season extremely well (thanks in part to an outstanding performance by Smits). My one complaint about Season 3 is that it's already over, and I have to wait a long time before the arrival of Season 4! However, I have a feeling it will definitely be worth waiting for.will definitely be worth waiting for.

B001AQR39O|3.0|The second season of \\"Californication\\" had a lot to live up to because the first season was so fabulous. Unfortunately, Season 2 falls pretty short. It picks up right where Season 1 left off, with Hank (David Duchovny) and Karen (Natascha McElhone) back together again. Their happiness is short-lived, however, because Hank accidentally mouth-rapes another woman, gets arrested, and learns that he's impregnated one of the many women he banged during Season 1. Not surprisingly, this is all too much for Karen, so she bails on Hank for the second time. Hank deals with this latest rejection the only way he knows how: drowning his sorrows and sleeping with every woman he crosses paths with. He also befriends a middle-aged rocker, Lew Ashby (Callum Keith Rennie), and agrees to write Lew's biography. Lew is even more childish than Hank, if you can believe that, and the two men get into numerous sticky situations. Meanwhile, Charlie and Marcy go through some serious rough patches due to Marcy's blossoming cocaine addiction and Charlie's venture into the porn industry, which results in an extramarital affair with a young porn actress.<br /><br />There are definitely some funny moments in Season 2, but overall, it was a major letdown for me. The storylines were way too unbelievable and over the top. There were too many crazy things going on at once, to the point that it all got kind of ridiculous. Also, the Charlie/Daisy storyline really bothered me, and I was disgusted by the changes to Charlie's character this season. I sincerely hope the writers do a better job with Season 3, if there even IS a Season 3. I guess we'll see what happens.

B000A2XC1C|5.0|It all began a long time ago, a woodcutter/toymaker named Claus (David Huddleson)and his wife Anya (Judy Cornwell) including two Reindeer Donner and Blitzen who were on the verge of death during a storm are rescued by a magic force that takes them to the north pole. They are greeted by a kingdom of Elves including Patch (Dudly Moore) who greets them as they offer them a new home. Claus however is a chosen one who is destined to fulfil a prophecy of bringing joy and happiness to children around christmas time, an ancient elf (Burgess Merideth) grants him special powers and immortality as Santa Claus who is a peaceful and magical being. Ever since then he has made children all over the world happy throughout the years and centuries including the 20th century to the 80's, however Patch decides to move on to better places to work like New York City where he meets greedy toy tycoon B.Z.(John Lithgow) and works for him on the latest invention that could make B.Z. take over the holidays. As now Santa whom joins up with a homeless young boy named Joe (Christian Fitzpatrick) and a girl named Cornelia (Carrie Kei Heim) to save his elf friend and save Christmas for all the kids in the world.<br /><br />A wonderful, hugely entertaining and very underrated Christmas comedy-fantasy flick! this movie is from Alexander and Ilya Salkind who brought you \\"Superman The Movie\\" and director Pierre Spengler whou brought you \\"Supergirl\\" has made a delightful modern fairy tale that feels like 2 movies in one with the first half being the better then the second half. This movie came out in 1985 as a supposed flop when it was an expensive film that gained mixed reviews but became somewhat of a cult hit thanks to video rentals and TV showings. Some critics feel the film lacks coherence and that Santa feels like a supporting character compared to Dudly Moore's character whom stole the show from the title hero, but this is a exciting reinvention of the Santa Claus myth with good production values, not half-bad acting and a nice score by Henry Mancini with a heartwarming song by Sheena Easton.<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent picture and sound quality thanks to THX with a nice 12 page 20th anniversary commemorative Booklet with an interview with the Salkinds, Audio Commentary, U.S. and foreign trailers, and bios.

0575081406|3.0|OK, for some strange reason a Chronicler decides to visit a much sought after, but hidden, hero/villan. And guess what, this hidden, sought after hero is now an Inn Keeper who jumps at the chance to tell his whole story to this stranger. So, Kvothe is a poor boy traveling with his family, a road show group. Along comes a Dark villan who kills his whole troup, then disappears. Kvothe travels to town. Now he is a poor boy, in the poor section of town, scraping scraps to stay alive. Oh, did I mention, He Is Poor? Then, after saving pennies for a LONG time he joins another traveling group so he can attend the University. He arrives and with a stroke of luck, (who'da guessed), gets in but is too poor to afford just about everything. This goes on for years. Like Stephen Kings first book of the \\"Gunslinger\\" that starts out slow to provide background, then hits you with a bang in book two. I have tepid hope that this is the case here. I can see Rothfuss has the obvious ability to create meaty characters, and has set the premise of interesting things to come. We can only hope that promise is kept.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|...version first. I only just read Jane Eyre last month, and I fell in love with it. So I set out to watch as many adaptations as I could. The Masterpiece Theatre was the second one I watched, and have seen another since, and I am afraid I really should have waited. Not that the other versions were not wonderful tellings of this amazing story, or that I will not continue on my quest, but you know what they say about saving the best for last!    And indeed, if anyone else is thinking about watching the many versions of Jane Eyre, I offer that exact advice. Watch and enjoy the others first, so they at least have a fair chance of stealing a place in your heart before you get to this one!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|When I saw this movie, I liked it almost right away. In fact, this is what caused me to become an FF7 fan in the first place. I wasn't clear with the story because I hadn't played Final Fantasy 7 before. Fortunatly, it has an option to watch a type of overview of Final Fantasy 7. It's about twenty five minutes long, but at least I had something go by. Anyhow, the music is excellent, the graphics are really good, and the story is really good. My advice to those who haven't played Final Fantasy 7 is to pay close attention to what's happening, and what the characters are talking about.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|What a disappointment this movie was. I remember when I was much younger, and heard about the making of this movie.  I wanted to see it big-time. Now, after I've seen it much later on in life, it stunk. The nudity wasn't even worth the watch! Penthouses 'bomb', is still alive, but it isn't worthy of wasting your time on it. Avoid it, and save your time and money.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I heard Bon Iver on Letterman a few nights ago. They performed \\"Skinny Love\\". I've had the song in my head ever since, so I decided to check out some of their other songs. I love all the songs on \\"For Emma, Forever ago\\". Some people have said their music is a bit depressing, but I don't think so at all. I find it inspiring. They are incredibly talented and are a breath of fresh air on the music scene where raw talent is now so rare. Anyone who appreciates beautiful music, should definitely buy this.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|When I first heard about this film, I thought for sure that some idiot was going to win a Darwin award by trying to \\"curve\\" a .45 cal. slug.   This movie got hyped to the heavans but did not make a big enough splash  at the box office to make any real money. Some of the action sequences are very cool but ultimately Wanted does'nt add up to much.    Also, the plot of Wanted, about a group of assasins led by some mystical cult, is a great idea executed badly. The producer/directors relied too much on Angelina Jolie's appeal as the main box-office draw, instead of a well thought out story. James McAvoy, looking like a homeless person in the film, was supposed to excite female movie-goers. I don't think that worked either. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp are also in Wanted, both good actors given nothing much to do.     I recommend a better hit-man film: \\"The Mechanic\\" w/Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent or Sonny Chiba's \\"Golgo 13\\". Buy those and rent Wanted.
B001DU8T6S|3.0|I'ts a good rock album. The sound is great and the songs are good.  The only thing missing is the \\"Queen Sound\\". I Can't recognize the specific guitar sound of Brian May.
B0015HZAK2|4.0|I bought this as a vinyl EP record when it first came out in 1983 or so, and played it until the grooves wore out.  It is definitely one of the great musical documents of the era - one of my favorites - and captures a moment in time that I have been reliving for 25 years.      I was thrilled when the original CD version came out in the early 90s, but like many people, was shocked to find that they had cut a part out of the middle of The Electric Co., where Bono is doing some vocal riffing and climbing the tower on the side of the stage.  It's the pivotal part of the song, and when you know it's there it's like cutting the heart out of the song.  I don't know what it sounds like if you've never heard the uncut version, but to me it entirely kills it.  All I can figure is there were some royalty issues concerning \\"Send in the Clowns\\" which he is riffing on.  The uncut VHS tape also went out of print a long time ago.    After waiting for many years for this to be remastered, I was hoping so much that they would restore the uncut version of the song.  You'd think after all these years any copyright problems could be taken care of.  However, the cut is still there, and it is in fact, EVEN BIGGER.  Yes, there is an even bigger chunk out of the song at the same place.  I guess they thought it would flow better that way, but it still sounds like crap.  I've never heard any official explaination, but I suppose it's possible that the uncut tapes simply don't exist anymore.  After all, this was recorded for a German TV show, not for a live album or with any notion that we'd be using it 25 years later.  Either that or it's just laziness or greed.  I don't know, but it's very disappointing.    Overall, the remastering is OK, but the audio quality is not really that much better than the original CD, there aren't any of the additional songs that are on the new DVD, and it has an even worse cut in the Electric Co.  (Note that the DVD has the same cut, as well as a couple of other similar edits.  The entire part where Bono climbs the tower is gone.  If you want to see that you need to get an old VHS copy.)  So, if you already have the original CD, you might not feel the need to buy this one.  If you are expecting it to be uncut like the original EP, you will be disappointed.  Get the DVD for the additional songs, though - they should have at least put them on the CD.

B000002TQV|3.0|Just glancing on a rating website and seeing an average of 4.11 made me think about \\"The Bends\\". I like it yes, but I have never loved it. And I don't feel the need to love it.<br /><br />Maybe here's why - I was never one to get into this album when it first arrived, and that seems criminal. Friends who are fans of this always talk of the nostalgia it creates, how they reminisce about their great discovery of Radiohead. They talk about how this album changed and shaped their understanding of music. It was their first maturing turning point in musical appreciation. Well, excellent. But I wasn't there, and didn't care for Radiohead as a youth. Yes, there are some standout memorable tracks here, but too much of it strikes me as standard and predictable. Ultimately it's guitar rock that sometimes hits the spot, but just as often drifts by.
B000008H1W|5.0|I always liked Jethro Tull from about the time I was in high school.  I had several Tull albums and tapes but somehow this one I had not ever listened to until I was in my late fourties. I had heard \\"Minstrel\\" on other live albums but not the rest of this album. In retrospect, I don't think I was mature enough back then to really appreciate this album.     I know there is a great deal of variation in musical taste but for me this is \\"the\\" unrecognized album of the 70's.  It is not just good.  It rises to a level of both musicianship and artful presentation that is totally beyond what few, if any, pop/rock albums ever attain to.  However, even for Tull fans it will not be obvious on the first listen.  Perhaps not until the second or third will you begin to see that this album is the nexus album for TULL.  If you favor the more pop/rock oriented TULL songs this may not do it for you as much as other TULL albums.  But for me it is the unrecognized pinnacle of TULL.      The long track, Baker Street Muse, I kind of glossed over the first two or three times I heard it.  But then something happened on about the fourth listen.  It was the most absorbing and cathartic experience I have ever had listening to a piece of music.  The whole album is a masterpiece but this track is something special.      When you buy this album you are not just getting a good album.  You are buying an album that rises to the level of art.  And either you get it or you don't.  And that is why it is so good.
B001DDBCUU|1.0|I've recently gotten into the TV series so I decided to check out the movie, despite poor reviews from my peers.  The movie is nowhere near the quality of the show.  The way the movie has been written is much different from the show, especially the narration which doesn't have the same creative insights Carrie usually has.  On top of this its not that funny, mainly because Samantha doesn't act like a slut in the show (she sleeps with only 1 guy, very unSamantha-like).  Everything in the movie was very unoriginal to me and unrealistic so I can't recommend this film at all.

B000002LGA|5.0|Lou Reed is one of those artists that you either loathe or love. I would highly recommend this to any Reed fans, but then again they are more than likely already on board. If you are a curious music enthusiast looking for something different, this may be a good album to cut your teeth on. This album came out at a point  when for the umpteenth time you thought Lou had rode off into the sunset. Lou is a master of the critically acclaimed album that had miserable public sales == New York was one of the exceptions both critically acclaimed and actually saw air time on FM stations. KLM
0375842209|5.0|This is by far the most beautiful book I have ever read.  I am amazed it is Young Adult and think it should absolutely be in the Adult section as well.  I began reading this book on an airplane and finished in the privacy of my own home, thank goodness; the tears flowed rapidly toward the end of the book.  It takes place during the holocaust, it is impossible to not be a sad book.  However, at the same time it is educating and incredibly heart-warming.  An absolute must read!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I don't get Showtime, so I couldn't wait to watch Season 2.  Once I started on the episodes, I couldn't stop.  Terrific episodes!

B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins was an interesting take on an established character and franchise. Batman has always been one of the most morally complex 'superheroes' out there and Nolan used his movie to explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne in a manner that Tim Burton's earlier movies barely touched on. However, it was let down by a relatively unimpressive pair of villains, a weak ending and far too much stuff being shoehorned into the plot, resulting in bloat. For all of that, it was still an impressive film.    The first film ended with the establishing of the alliance between Lt. Jim Gordon of the Gotham City police department and Batman, and the beginning of a crime spree by a shadowy figure known as the Joker. The second movie picks up a few weeks or months later, with the Joker rapidly becoming public enemy number one and Batman's attempts to locate and defeat him being unsuccessful, especially as his crimefighting crusade is becoming complicated by the emergence of ham-fisted copy-cat vigilantes. However, a new district attorney, Harvey Dent, has made it his business to bring down Gotham's criminals and after a series of major successes against important gangs and crime bosses, Bruce Wayne begins to let himself think that maybe he won't have to be Batman forever.    Of course, this is only the beginning of the story. Batman, Dent and Gordon form an unofficial alliance to bring down and defeat the criminals of the city, but the Joker reacts by forming his own alliance of the various criminal elements against them. The result is an escalating series of complex, doublecrossing traps and counter-traps by both sides. The stakes are raised, lives are lost, and Gotham is brought into utter chaos as a result. And two men's souls and morals are caught in the balance.    The Dark Knight is a fiendishly clever film which works on a thematic level that superhero movies have rarely operated at before. For this reason, the movie has already been hailed as the most important superhero movie to date, elevating the genre to a new level of credibility (possibly having the same effect on the genre that 2001 had on science fiction or Lord of the Rings on fantasy films). It's hard to argue entirely against this: The Dark Knight is a movie of impressive ambitions, but whilst from an artistic perspective it may indeed be worthy of the hype bestowed upon it, its role as entertainment accordingly suffers in several key areas.    Much has been made of the late Heath Ledger's remarkable performance as the Joker. Taking on a role that Jack Nicholson had made memorable in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman movie was a challenge, but one that Ledger rose to by simply making his Joker an insane agent of chaos, an enigma, rather than a loud clown with a detailed (if unoriginal) backstory. The Joker gets no backplot here, nothing to make him sympathetic on a human level. He is a psychopath and a monster, one that Ledger portrays with brilliant intensity and some excellent comedic timing. However, his role in the film appears misleading. The heart of The Dark Knight is the war for the soul of Harvey Dent, and in that story the Joker is a catalyst. The Joker's significant amounts of screentime eat into the more compelling story of Dent (an almost-equally impressive performance from Aaron Eckhart), who is absent from the plot for long periods of time and his inevitable late-film transformation is not really given enough time to be fully convincing.    A more basic problem is that the movie is too long, and several major climactic set-pieces take place some considerable time before the end of the movie. Hollywood CGI whiz and blogger Mojo has advanced a theory that The Dark Knight actually is an amalgamation of two films into one, and if the Joker and Dent strands had been separated (perhaps by having the Joker's antics and his late-movie plot involving two ferries, which come out of nowhere, as one film and the fall of Dent in another) both would have been stronger. As it stands, the latter third of the movie feels considerably less-developed than the rest, and the series of apparently-but-not-quite final moments in the movie begins to challenge Return of the King at times for its frustration.    Performances are universally excellent. Eckhart and Ledger get special nods, but supporting hands from the first movie Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and especially Michael Caine all give excellent performances. Caine in particular impresses, with Alfred's experiences as a soldier giving him a moral authority that he uses to convince Batman to do the hard thing at times, paying off in a spectacular moment when Batman makes precisely the opposite decision to what the audience expects. Similarly, after a relatively minor role in the first movie Oldman steps up as Gordon and makes him a credible threat to the city's criminals. In a busy movie, Freeman's character of Lucius Fox even has time for an amusing subplot in which he discovers a Wayne Enterprises employee who has figured out where a chunk of the company's revenue is going and why. Maggie Gyllenhaall, taking over the Katie Holmes role from the first film (thankfully, as Gyllenhaal is a much better actress), also impresses. Christian Bale does good work as Wayne/Batman, but in a movie of stand-out performances from even the secondary cast, Bale merely settles for being pretty good.    The Dark Knight (****) is an effective, impressive and dark film with stand-out acting and an interesting thematic arc, but occasionally it lacks focus and has some scripting and pacing issues. It is definitely one of the better superhero movies of recent years, but I'd hesitate about calling it the best. What is does do, however, is aim for something much higher than most superhero movies even think about achieving and if it falls short, it remains an impressive ambition.

0618918248|4.0|I was hesitating whether to give this book three stars or four stars. On one hand, I think the book is excellent in many ways, well-written, and even fun to read as Dawkins exhibits amazing eloquence in his writing. Dawkins makes many excellent arguments against the existence of a God. To the atheist, this book serves as a fantastic guide from a scientist's perspective.<br /><br />But now for the other hand: Dawkins may have had some religious beliefs while a child, but he ditched them at a very young age, and has completely lost site of what it's like to be a Christian. Although there are exceptions in this book, for the most part he portrays Christians as a bunch of dumb, uneducated, gullible bumpkins who just fall for the religious line without question.<br /><br />He fails to understand just how deep the religious mindset goes and why it's more than just falling for some words from the pulpit. I have lived as a Christian, and I felt it and understood it. God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit were very real to me until I was about 30. It was only after that that I started to question things and realize that what I felt might not really be coming from a supernatural entity. And breaking free was by no means easy. It was a huge, pain-filled struggle, one which left scars that I still have to this day.<br /><br />These are issues that Dawkins cannot relate to, because he hasn't been there.<br /><br />So while this book is an excellent resource for atheists, it's unlikely that it converted many religious people to atheism. More likely all it has done is anger them.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? Yes. I recommend it to everyone, religious people and atheists alike. But I don't think it will have its intended outcome with many religious people.<br /><br />Jeff Mark<br />Author, [[ASIN:0981631304 Christian No More]]
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This is such a nice story. I bought the DVD to share with my granddaughter and really enjoyed watching it with her.

Even though a movie for children, adults can enjoy it too!

B000WGNLLW|4.0|When I first heard the single \\"Falling Down\\" I was expecting a straight forward Duran album, full of melody and easy classic tracks.  For me their last album, \\"Astronaut\\" was a major dissapointment, and not the classic to equal the hype of the original 5 line-up.  This album however appeals to me more and grows on you from each listen.    When Andy Taylor left the band, I was delighted, his style no longer suited the style the band needed, and Live he just didn't fit in making a mess of none Andy Taylor tracks i.e. \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Notorious\\" he has one stlye of playing and that's it.  Red Carpet Massacre has some surprise moments on there like the \\"Night-Runner\\" track with Timberlands trademark all over it.  I loved Pop Trash, and find this album in the same vein, a very underrated well produced Duran album, definately worth more than one listen.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I will begin this review by stating that I am a proud American citizen, an immigrant from a Third World country who grew up in America.  I have also traveled around the world, and have experienced the health care systems in other countries.  I also have friends and family living in other countries, both developed and under-developed countries.  From my own experiences in America and in other countries, and those related to me by my friends and family, I've come to believe that the US healthcare system is extremely inefficient, corrupt, and unfriendly to customers.  If one were to consider slavery as 19th century America's national shame, then healthcare is probably the shame of our time.  Many individuals have tried to describe the failings of America's health care system in editorials, books, and news reports.  But this 2-hr long documentary captures the essence of these failures; both cause and effect, and the agents.  Sicko correctly reveals the fundamental cause: greed, and the system whereby greed is allowed to take people's lives: a deregulated, privately run health care system.  Taken together, this leads to a health care safety net with very big holes.  Importantly, Moore focuses only on those who do have insurance, and shows the loopholes that allow health care providers to deny care.  So instead of coming of as a paean to the poor and uninsured, this movie actually looks at those that have been insured; the working professionals both blue and white collar.  And as a good liberal, Moore contrasts the American system with those in Canada, Cuba, France and England.<br /><br />The failings of this movie are also numerous.  First of, Moore fails to elucidate the specific laws that have created our current health care system.  He only looks at one specific bill passed during the Nixon administration that sanctioned HMO's as the pre-eminent form of health care provider in the US.  The movie should have spent some time presenting the origins of worker-provided care, the origins of France's present health care system under Vichy rule, and differences in the health care education in different countries.  The US is unique in that one needs an undergraduate degree before entering medical school.  This by itself dramatically increases the time and cost incurred by doctors in training, which in turn raises their salaries.<br /><br />The 2nd major failing of this documentary is the very incomplete comparison of the US health care system to those in other countries.  Specifically, there were no comparisons with health care systems in Asia, such as those of Singapore, China and India.  The latter two produce many of America's best doctors and medical researchers.  The former, Singapore, has probably the world's best health care system in terms of cost/benefit ratio, access by all citizens to latest technical advances, and a strong orientation on customer satisfaction.<br /><br />A third major failing, and the biggest surprise of this movie, was the complete absence of mention of patient privacy.  I suspect Moore examined Iceland's system and came away with more questions than answers as to the need of patient privacy.  And probably the biggest failing of this movie is the absence of aggregate statistics.  Yes, Mr. Moore provides prices that specific individuals have had to pay for specific medical services and goods.  But Mr. Moore does not include important statistics like the trend in HMO deductibles and premiums over time, trends in Medicare and Medicaid spending (overall and per capita) over time, comparisons of per capita medical costs across different countries, etc, etc...  Nobody can argue with numbers, but lots of people can argue with anecdotal evidence, which is what this documentary almost exclusively presents.<br /><br />But overall, I still like and recommend this movie.  I believe the facts presented in the movie are correct, and I agree with Mr. Moore's opinion.origins of France's present health care system under Vichy rule, and differences in the health care education in different countries.

I saw Mayall perform this album on his tour the same year this was recorded live and despite the effects of the hash I smoked and the excitement of the tiny little beauty who sat atop my shoulders the whole show in order to see over the crowd, I was mesmerized!  This group pulled off a first; they rocked WITHOUT A DRUMMER!!!  Amazing.

B0000041TD|5.0|Although some of the most ardent opera buffs will still prefer Beecham, this is really the version to turn to for most people. This is quite simply Pavarotti's best role, full of vigour and poetry. If one really wished to find something to pick on, it would perhaps be that he only rarely seems willing to sing quietly, but the feeling (in particular the desperation) and warmth he brings to the role is, as far as I know, unmatched. Freni also, in my view, outperforms e.g. Callas, at least in terms of sheer beauty of sound, although a case could be made that Callas is the superior interpreter. Panerai and Harwood are excellent as well.    But if there is anything sweeping all competition aside, it is Karajan. He has simply got it all, focus on orchestral beauty as well as a taut grip on the drama and momentum. Put that together with splendid sound, and you've got a winning set. A must.

B000YPUFA6|5.0|I've watched all three Resident Evil films and they are good.  Resident Evil- Extinction in my opinion was the best of the three.  No, I can't compare them to the videogames because I never played the videogames.  I can only compare them to other films in the \\"zombie\\" genre.  They are all three well-done films and each builds on the previous film.  The first movie is concentrated on a particular location: the mysterious underground research facility under \\"Raccoon City\\", sometime in the future, where a research virus breaks out and turns both people and animals into undead zombies.  In the second film, the virus has spread above ground and all of Raccoon City and beyond is affected.  In this last movie, the virus has gone worldwide.  Now-I'm a big fan of \\"bonus features\\" on DVDs.  Sometimes you watch a movie and think umph--second-rate at best.  Then you watch the \\"bonus features\\" in which the director, the actors and actresses, the photographers and everyone talk about all the work they went through to produce the film--down to incredible little details, little minutiae that flash through in an instant of the final movie--you think about the hundreds of person-years that went into the making of the movie, and you end up thinking, \\"yeah, that WAS pretty cool actually how they did that--actually that was a decent film...\\"  [Other times I've watched special features and concluded the film was still terrible..] In this case, some of the special features on DVD were really interesting, and added value.  In addition, some of the visuals in this movie were simply stunning.  Especially on Blu-Ray.  That's why I ended up getting the Blu-Ray version, after already owning the regular DVD version.  Not once, but twice getting the Blu-Ray version.  Neither time would the Blu-Ray version play properly.  Turned out it required an update to the Blu-Ray firmware; something I've had to do again now, with the release of Avatar on Blu-Ray.<br />Back to the movie itself: it has..well yes of course it has Milla Jovovich..but besides that, it has two very different colour palettes.  Aboveground in the Nevada desert and a futuristic, abandoned Las Vegas: all bright yellows and tans.  Belowground, in the remaining complexes inhabited by the corporate and government elite: all cool, pale blue light and blackness.  The lead photographer was an ace.  They wanted to do something new for a zombie movie.  He said: make it in broad daylight!  They said: You CANT make a scary movie in broad daylight--darkness is needed to enhance the suspense.  He said: Oh I THINK I CAN!  And...HE DID!  And it works.  This film is gorgeous, and suspenseful, and a great third film for the trilogy.  I have to confess I like the aboveground scenes more than the below-ground, classic dark/scary stuff.  Watch this film!<br /><br />K.

I found it very interesting to learn about the early Polaroid inventors and enthusiasts, and their efforts to make it a commonly accessible art medium for anyone who has sight. It showcases highly acclaimed artists including Ansel Adams, but also identifies low-profile film artists, and as a result brings in a variety of compositional style, colors, and themes. It also contains an index of camera models and functions as a convenient camera reference. Through an extensive collection of beautiful Polaroid photos, this book diminishes the snap-shot stereotype of Polaroid film, and transforms it into a complex and purposeful form of art and expression.

Sadly, because of my youth - at least in my parents' eyes, I never had the chance to see them live. As I grew older, I saw all of their solo ventures, but the magic of a live Police concert forever eluded me. I had even met all three blokes and shared my story with them, careful not to bring up that dreadful question of a reunion. In 2007 when they announced the tour, I was beside myself. I had patiently waited 24 years to see my heroes perform together. My friends, who until this point, thought I was just insane to think they would ever tour again, were delighted for me. I saw the tour twice in Los Angeles, and was even lucky enough to attend the final performance at Madison Square Garden - the last of the tour, and it seems, the last performance ever by Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers.<br />Police fans everywhere are begging the powers that be to dig into the vaults and release the goodies that came out on VHS in the 80's. A wealth of material remains unreleased on DVD. This tour demanded a DVD. The musical portion is an entire show shot in December of 2007 in Buenos Aires. The guys are in top form. Most \\"reunion\\" tours show the passage of time quite sadly. The Police had aged like fine wine. Sting's voice was in astoundingly good shape. Stewart Copeland still worked the kit like the musical magician he is. Andy Summers returned to rock guitar playing with a vengeance, after almost fading away in the 90's in the jazz fusion realm. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Andy's solo discs, but to hear him blaze during Driven To Tears is the stuff dreams are made of. My favorite tracks are an atmospheric reading of Walking On the Moon, and funktified versions of Walking In Your Footsteps and Voices Inside My Head. The picture is razor sharp and the sound is incredible. The shots of the audience bouncing up and down tell of the excitement this crowd felt at being there.<br />The bonus material includes a documentary by Stewart's son Jordan that aptly displays the genuine joy these three guys have when they play together. But that joy doesn't come without an awful lot of hard work. They rehearsed to the point of almost over-rehearsing. As any Police fan knows, the strength of the band is in its improvisation. Their extended musical forays into unknown territory are legendary. These three guys could read each other on stage so well it was eerie. Also included is the standard photo gallery, including some nice shots by Andy.<br />To have the audio of the concert on two CD's is a nice touch, but every Police fan I have talked to said - \\"Is that it?\\" I have to admit, the extras seem a bit skimpy. To wait so long for \\"new\\" Police material is nerve-wracking as it is, and then a release like this comes out, and you can't help but feel slightly let down. I suppose we should be grateful that there is any \\"new\\" material at all, since I can remember in the not-to-distant past any mention of a Police reunion would have been downright \\"certifiable.\\"citement this crowd felt at being there.

B000SQJ2JG|3.0|This is the one and only Deep Purple album from the Tommy Bolin era. This album sounds more like early Whitesnake than the classic Purple combined prog rock/hard rock combination. Not surprising it sounds like Whitesnake since David Coverdale and Jon Lord would reunite in that band 2 to 3 years later followed by Ian Paice coming on board later on.    Bolin's guitar playing is radically different from Blackmore's Bolin's playing had more of a slide guitar effect to it.    While Coverdale's songs sound like Whitesnake, Glenn Hughes provided a different sound on the funk influenced Getting Together and the Stevie Wonder influenced This Time Around.    The highlight song, IMHP, was the closer \\"You Keep on Moving\\". It features 3 way harmony vocals between Coverdale, Hughes, and Bolin.    The Bolin lineup lasted only 9 month before drugs and swinging caused this version of Deep Purple to implode. A few months later, Bolin would die from a drug overdose.    If you like this album, I also recommend the pre 1984 (Slide It In) Whitesnake albums.
0439023483|5.0|I could not put The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, down - I had to read it in one go over the span of several hours because I was that enthralled with the story and the characters.    The novel takes place in a dystopia several hundred years in the future, in which the U.S. has become twelve Districts ruled by one Capitol. About a hundred or fewer years previously, there were thirteen Districts, and together they decided to band together and rebel against the Capitol - and they were crushed. In retaliation, the Capitol destroyed District 13, and to punish the other twelve further, they now have to participate in the Hunger Games.    The Hunger Games are an annual, televised \\"battle royale\\" between twenty-four contestants - a randomly picked boy and a girl from each District - in which the last (wo)man standing lives in prosperity for the rest of their life, and their district is showered with food and other luxuries (hence the \\"hunger\\" part). Only teenagers are eligible. Contestants, who are called \\"tributes,\\" have to survive in the wild as well as battle with each other.    Our hero is Katniss, a girl from one of the very poorest and hungriest districts - 12, which used to be Appalachia, and from which there hasn't been a winner in thirty years or so. Her name isn't drawn from the hat, but her little sister's is - so Katniss steps up as a volunteer \\"tribute.\\" She and a boy she barely knows, Peeta, are District 12's representatives.    I appreciate that the novel has a strong female protagonist - something that's lacking in YA sometimes. Katniss is smart, adept, quick on her feet, and quick to take action in a dangerous situation. Amazingly, she also isn't so perfect that she's boring. She's outsmarted by some characters, she's outfought by others, and she has a difficult time trusting others and forming close relationships, which reflects poorly on her and have serious consequences.    It's written in first person, which can be a gamble at the best of times. I understand that the tone/style is off-putting to some - it's written in a very matter-of-fact and dry voice (which was quite funny at times to me, but others thought it was un-relatable-to). However, I \\"bought\\" the voice because it reflects well on Katniss's personality, and it changes throughout the novel as she grows from her experiences, such as with Rue especially. I found it to be a refreshing change from a lot of YA fiction about girls, and a very engaging novel - I was completely caught up in Katniss's experiences. The pacing was also perfect for me - it's not too drawn-out, but it doesn't give the impression of it all being over too quickly. There's action, adventure, horror, and even, yes, romance.    It can be very dark at times, as well - from Haymitch's (the one living District 12 winner) constant alcoholism and oblivion to the world around him, to the violence and desperation that takes place in the competition, to the \\"entertainment\\" value of the Games, to the way relationships are manipulated out of necessity, to the effect of war and violence on the human mind, to the glimpses we see of the politics and government behind the Games, to the inherent moral grayness of winning/competing in the Games.    It's very well crafted, and a lot of it, especially the end (\\"End of Book One,\\" obviously) means there's going to be a sequel. I hope the series goes farther and explores a rebellion against the government (it would be disappointing if it degenerated into a love triangle plot only), but more importantly how Katniss is supposed to return to her family and District but isn't, ultimately, the same anymore, as well as her having to cope with her own actions in the Games. In short - I eagerly look forward to more!

B0014NDXGA|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend, an avid golfer with a 2 handicap.   He mentioned that he wanted one, so I set out to buy him the best that I could.  I consulted with one of his buddies, who steered me to the Bushnell brand.  Based upon the reviews, I chose this one, and I made the right choice.  My boyfriend LOVES this!  He can't stop talking about it:)
0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is now my favorite author.  The way he describes situations and insubstantials (such as the magic system) makes you envision exactly what his vision is. Not only that, but he can do it in 1/5th the type space than any other author.
B001L63JC8|5.0|It's the best one they made.  You really need to read the story that comes with the album (and the CD) to follow what it's all about.  It's progressive album rock at it's best.      OK.  I just listened to this re-mixed album all the way though a couple of times - and I have to say, it is a vast improvement from the original mix.  The music and vocals are \\"crisper\\".  Background stuff is clearly heard.  It just sounds so clean, but with the original anolog sound (yes, there are bits and pieces of distortion in there, like on the original album).  The stereo mixing is superb - I'm impressed.  They used the exact same takes, which has killed other \\"re-mixes\\" by making the music different - which is usually not better because that is not what you remember.
0385340990|5.0|What a fun and heart warming read.  A great way to expand your knowledge of history during World War II.

0575081406|1.0|[Some spoilers to follow. Of course there is not much to spoil.]    It is hard to rate negatively a book with so many praising reviews. I am almost asking myself: am I crazy here? Am I missing something? Perhaps.    You have probably already read the praise (coming of age story, good writing, cool magic system, hints of more to come). I have read it as well. Sure. All of it is very true. Except it doesn't matter. The Name of The Wind is a book about nothing. In fact, save the freaking trees!    Let me elaborate.    1. Cliches.   Gifted boy, dead parents, magical university, it may not seem like much, and I could forgive it all, even for the first. Kvothe is as boring as every Mary Sue genius. I don't give a damn if he becomes a tragic anti hero (in fact I am bloody sure he will, continuing the cliche of a cliche), in this book, there ain't no stopping him.     2. The FUN details  The book is obssessed with money. The climax of the story has Kvothe winning not only a mere price of his broken lute from the offender, but TWICE the amount. I mean, seriously! Still, I can forgive even this.    3. The Nothing  What I cannot forgive is the fact that the book is a diary of the author's self-indulging himself. I could see using Mary Sue for humour. Too bad the book is 100% serious. Too bad the book is 720 pages of fluff with only a single event of any matter happening (in the first 100 pages).    Mr. Rothfuss, save the bloody trees. Hire an editor, cut out 500 pages of fluff, give us a story.   I don't care how many talents Kvothe's tuition is. I don't care how many coppers there are in a silver. I don't care what rate a loan shark is giving these days.   Give me a story.    P.s. Kvothe doesn't burn down the town of Trebon, a dragon (yep, there are dragons too) does. Also, it's not the town but actually like three houses. Noone got hurt though I heard someone broke a leg.   Hope this gives you a hint that bait-and-switch is about the most this book can offer.

The letter format is wonderful- makes you realize what a lost art letter-writing really is in today's world of intant messages and strange abbreviations!  Rather than using a narrator, each character is so well-developed through their own words.  I would love for there to be a sequel!

B001ACH4DS|1.0|Ok, so i listened to the little samples of songs on Amazon & was not impressed, but I thought SURELY the actual cd with the actual whole songs on it had to be awesome, right?  WRONG!!  I am soooooo disappointed with this cd.  The achingly beautiful voice I heard in \\"Billy Jean\\" on AI is nowhere to be found.  What is to be found is lots of PRODUCTION and MUSIC and boring boring BORING REPETITION.  You might as well play the 1st song over & over...they all sound the same anyway.  Please PLEASE David, on your next cd give us what we crave...that voice that is raw with emotion & power.  Bring us to tears, bring us to our knees...we know you can do it!!

0439023483|5.0|Hunger games is an excellent read for all ages. If you have followed her other books, then you know that she likes to right about main characters that live in poverty and go through some sort of coming of age through battles. In the series, \\"The Underland Chronicles,\\" the main character, Gregor, lives in a impoverished apartment with his immediate family except he hasn't seen his father in several years/. In the Hunger Games, the main character also lives in a impoverished apartment and her dad has been dead for several years. Then, Gregor leaves his family to go fight a war. His family has no idea where he is at all. Again, very similarly, The main character of the Hunger Games has t fight for her life without her family being able to know how she is.

It not only has the Scriptures, but it has a several sections in the back that educate you on so many things such as other religions and what they believe.  It has a summary at each beginning that is concise and helpful.  Great Bible!
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal has done an outstanding job with this CD. It is so soulful and beautiful - it took me back to when music was music. I hope he seriously considers doing another CD of this type.

Well Done, Seal!
B00005T7I1|5.0|Larger than life.  Fun !  Sexy ! (clean sexy; only suggested under tone) Colorful sets to the max but not too.    Warren Beatty could not have been better.  I don't see enough of his films.  I am going to look for more of his films.    Wow the make up  and costumes are really somethin' !  I didn't get who the other actors were until I read about 'em.  Cool stuff !    Not too violent.  Ok for kids if you let them watch anything with guns.  I grew up watching tons of stuff with guns in the sixties.  This movie is like that.  Not like Dirty Harry scary stuff.  I played with plastic guns as a kid.  I don't own a gun now and do not beat people up etc if they disagree with me.    Not saying that I would not remove guns and violence from our culture if I could.  Just that this movie is not harmful considering all else that goes on.    Heck I am a yoga instructor and meditate (\\"for crying out loud\\" as they used to say).  Fun movie !  Just like you slipped into an old comic book came to life.
0333720016|4.0|My daughter came home from preschool asking me if I could buy this book. I went to three different bookstores looking for it...nothing. I finally found it on amazon.

I read it to my daycare kids and they requested it often. When a friend had a baby shower we were asked to bring a baby book in lieu of a card, and I knew immediately which one I wanted. I went looking for it every where and couldn't find it. I was so disappointed, but then remembered Amazon.com. I logged in and sure enough, they had it! I was thrilled and I know they are going to love it.

0618918248|5.0|For anyone who is wondering if this book is right for them: you will only enjoy this book if you are already open to the idea of a universe without a god. If you are a firm believer in your particular religion, then there is little chance that Dawkins will be able to shake you from you world view.     For me, someone who was already atheist before reading, this book was life changing. This book was able to sum up a whole spectrum of ideas that I was not able to put my finger on before. If you want to be able to have a more intelligent discussion about god, something more than \\"you're an idiot\\", then you must read this book.

0132350882|5.0|I knew I was going to like this book after I read the Foreword and Introduction. I know not many people read those and as an author myself this bothers me, but it gives insight to why the author has written the book, which is a very important thing to understand. I was hooked by the affirmation that details are important and that the only meaningful metric is the number of \\"wtfs\\" per minute in a code review. For a long time I have kept my \\"profanities per test session\\" metric as a way to measure software usability.<br /><br />Long before I was a software testing guy, I was a coder. Back in those days it was common for rookie coders to sit next to guys with gray hair and bad breath (or if lucky next to ladies with better appearance and who smelled better) to learn the craft of writing code. Yes, coding was a craft before the attempt to make it an engineering discipline. Although there was a lot of bad code, there were plenty of people who took pride in how they coded. This book reminds me of what it was like to sit next to these intelligent<br />people as mentors.<br /><br />I have often lamented that today's young coders don't have this mentor/apprentice relationship. A reasonable facsimile would be to read this book and practice these very sensible and helpful lessons in coding. As a testing guy who has been through those 30 wtf/hour code reviews, my bulletin to developers is that: Your code can be better! This book can show you how!<br /><br />Here's one example: Have meaningful names. Instead of a function named \\"int d\\", how about \\"int ElapsedTimeInDays;\\"? There's a whole chapter about naming things. It reminds me of the coder I knew that liked to label COBOL paragraphs after towns and cities in Kansas. Why? So he could write GOTOs that read \\"GOTO Topeka.\\" He thought that was cute but the rest of us found it confusing and not-so-cute.<br /><br />I also appreciated the chapter on Unit Testing. As a tester, I love it when testing is mentioned, but Martin actually has specific guidance on what makes for good Test Driven Development and Unit Testing.<br /><br />This book is very readable, makes a lot of sense and would make most coders better. For testers that sit in on code reviews, this would be a great read for understanding how good code should be. I wish every coder in college or tech school would read this book before unleashing their creations upon the world.or good Test Driven Development and Unit Testing.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This movie came out when I was 13 years old, and I remember watching it like it was last week. I recall my favorite scene involving Steve Via tearing it up on stage. Now I'm 35 years old, and over the past year or two, I've been taking guitar classes focusing on the Blues Guitar, it's American history, and some of the masters that created and played this wonderful music. I just purchased and watched this movie for the first time in over 20 years, and now, having a little knowledge of the history of the Blues, this movie is even more enjoyable than ever! Now my favorite scene involves Ralph Macchio tearing it up on stage. I'm not going to go into the details of the movie - but if you're a fan of the Blues Guitar, Blues Harp, or any of it's history - this is a must see! Plus, it's always entertaining to watch a movie made in the 80's once in a while, isn't it? I highly recommend this one!

It's well-constructed and fairly easy to install.<br /><br />But after using it for three weeks, I have a major complaint: The vertical extending range is just not sufficient. I've been suffering significant back pain and part of the reason is that I'm looking *down* at my monitor. It's cranked up to the absolute maximum height -- which i measure at 15.5\\" -- and it's well below my typical (read: average) sitting position, in a regular desk/task chair. I estimate that this type of device should extend vertically about 21\\" from the top of a desk, to put a monitor at eye-level for a typically-sized person. (i.e., me)<br /><br />So, I'm having to return this product. I would gladly buy a similar product from the same company, but only if I can confirm that the vertical extension range is adequate.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This is a great CD and I love it more each time I listen to it. This guy is a superstar!  I love all of the songs, especially Bar-ba-sol and Permanent. I like it so much, I bought another one for a Christmas gift for my teenage niece.
031606792X|3.0|I fell in love with the characters of Edward and Bella in the first Twilight book.  The heart of \\"Twilight\\" (Bk. 1) was the developing realtionship between these two characters and the everyday moments they spent together...in Charlie's kitchen, in Bella's bedroom, in Edward's meadow.  Regrettably, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" (all 750+ pages of it) contains very few of these intimate exchanges and is a less satisying story because of it.  In fact, much of the story is told in big, sweeping statements (i.e. they went swimming, they went hunting, they watched a movie, etc.) rather than focusing on the nuances of Edward's and Bella's relationship.  The much-anticipated wedding was a let-down (they exchanged vows and then they danced; Jacob showed up) and the honeymoon was pretty much uninspiring (I kept wondering why they continued to stay on the island when they were miserable so much of the time).  And then the next 200 pages were narrated by Jacob!  I understand why Ms. Meyer chose this device, but I wish she had chosen another means to keep the story moving.  And then, finally, after 400+ pages, Ms. Meyer returned for a brief time to the realtionship of Edward and Bella...heaven...and then she was off again plowing through the many twists and turns of the plot.    Yes, if you love these characters you will want to read \\"Breaking Dawn\\", but do not expect to experience the exhilaration you did with the first book.  Too much effort is spent driving the plot rather than focusing on character development, and in particular, the relationship between Edward and Bella.
B000059T1E|4.0|Back in the 70s, when 20 year old musicians were being hailed as geniuses every week, many of those geniuses let the accolades go to their head. (How could they not--treated as royalty, they did what royalty has often done, believe they were better than others and everything they produced was remarkable, including their excrement.) Steve Winwood was a talented musician and songwriter who created some of the most memorable rock of his era. He teamed up some other well-respected geniuses and produced much fine, and some mediocre, material. This CD is full of both.<br /><br />When I played this LP, side 1 was the only side I listened to. 3 great songs, well blended in a delightful sequence, made it one of my favorites. I had not heard side 2 in a long time. Well, now I remember why. While Winwood could certainly play an astoundingly good piano, he had a tendency to noodle along without going anywhere. There is a lot of boredom on side 2. John Barleycorn, the much praised title track, sounded pretentious and lame to me then; today, with another 40 years of listening to British folk music under my belt, it sounds worse. This kind of music has been performed by a number of staggeringly talented musicians, and I'd rather hear any of them do it.<br /><br />When I write these, I try to imagine what you, the reader, might be looking for. After all, even Dave Marsh's opinions are just that, opinions. So, my opinion is that this CD, well remastered, has 3 incredibly fine songs on it, 2 toothless \\"extra tracks\\" to make it selllable, and 3 lesser songs on it that I will gladly live without.<br /><br />I had not heard those opening riffs to Glad in many years, but the same smile I felt back then reappeared instantly. That is a good song!<br /><br />As I publish this, I note that of 42 reviews, there are only 4 and 5 star reviews. That means something.....Forget the history lessons and who did what when stuff. Either it's a good LP or it ain't. It is!

0345444051|5.0|My copy of this 1950s science-fiction classic has a quote by C. S. Lewis on its cover: \\"There has been nothing like it for years; partly for the actual invention, but partly because here we meet a modern author who understands that there may be things that have a higher claim on humanity than its own survival.\\"    The other day, while reading *[[ASIN:0060819227 The Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis, Volume 3: Narnia, Cambridge, and Joy, 1950 - 1963]],* I found Lewis' entire review on *Childhood's End.* I was surprised, though, that he did not write it to be published at all. Instead, the review is a personal letter to his pen pal and then-future wife Joy Davidman Gresham, who had cautiously recommended the book to him.  Joy subsequently showed the letter to Clarke himself, who asked Lewis if the publisher may quote from the letter for promoting the book. To which Lewis replied, \\"If you will let me know *which* bits of my letter your people want to use, I am sure I shall have no objection - as you know one doesn' t like to give a free hand for *selection.* It is sometimes so done as to credit one with ungrammatical or even nonsensical sentences.\\" This probably explains why the above quote differs somewhat from the actual letter.    Since Lewis' thoughts on the book mirror my own experience in reading it pretty closely, and since I suspect that people will be more interested in a review by C. S. Lewis than a review by me, I will give you the letter in full.    Here we go:    As far as I can remember you were non-committal about *Childhood's End*: I suppose you were afraid that you might raise my expectations too high and lead to disappointment.    If that was your aim, it has succeeded, for I came to it expecting nothing in particular and have been thoroughly bowled over. It is quite out of range of the common space-and-time writers; away up near Lindsay's *Voyage to Arcturus* and Well's *First Men in the Moon.* It is better than any of Stapleton's. It hasn't got Ray Bradbury's delicacy, but then it has ten times his emotional power, and far more mythopoeia.    There is one bit of bad execution, I think: chapters 7 and 8, where the author doesn't seem to be at home. I mean, as a social picture it is flat and stiff, and all the gadgetry (for me) is a bore.    But what there is on the credit side! It is rather like the effect of the *Ring* [by Richard Wagner]--a self-riching work, harmony piling up on harmony, grandeur on grandeur, pity on pity. The first section, merely on the mystery of the Overlords, would be enough for most authors.    Then you find this is only the background, and when you have worked up to the climax in chapter 21, you find what seems to be an anti-climax and it slowly lifts itself to the utter climax. The first climax (...) brought tears to my eyes. There has been nothing like it for years: partly for the actual writing--\\"She has left her toys behind but ours go hence with us,\\" or \\"The island rose to meet the dawn,\\" but partly (still more, in fact) because here we meet a modern author who understands that there may be things that have a higher claim than the survival or happiness of humanity: a man who could almost understand \\"He that hateth not father and mother\\" and certainly would understand the situation in *Aeneid* III between those who go on to Latium and those who stay in Sicily.    We are almost brought up out of *psyche* into *pneuma* [that is, from matters of the soul to those of the spirit]. I mean, his myth does that to us imaginatively. Of course his own *thoughts* about what the higher level might be are not, in our eyes, very new or very profound: but that doesn't really make so much difference. (Though, by the way, it would have been better, even on purely literary grounds, to leave it in its mystery, to philosophise less.) After all, few authors' glosses on their own myths are as good as the myths: unless, like Dante, they take the glosses from other men, real thinkers.    The second climax,the long (not too long) drawn-out close is magnificent.    There is only one change (in conception) that I would want to make. It is a pity that he suggests a jealousy and a possible future revolt on the part of the Overlords. The motive is so ordinary that it cannot excite interest in itself, and as it is never going to be worked out of the handling cannot compensate for the banality. How much better, how much more in tune with Clarke's own imagined universe, if the Overlords were totally resigned, submissive yet erect in an eternal melancholy--like the great heroes and poets in Dante's Limbo who live forever \\"in desire but not in hope.\\"    But now one is starting to re-write the book.    Many *minor* dissatisfactions, of course. The women are all made up out of a few abstract ideas of jealousy, vanity, maternity etc. But it really matters very little: the thing is great enough to carry far more faults than it commits.    It is a strange comment on our age that such a book lies hid in a hideous paper-backed edition, wholly unnoticed by the *cognoscenti,* while any \\"realistic\\" drivel about some neurotic in a London flat--something that needs no real invention at all, something that any educated man could write if he chose, may get seriously reviewed and mentioned in serious books--as if it really mattered.    I wonder how long this tyranny will last? Twenty years ago, I felt no doubt that I should live to see it all break up and great literature return: but here I am, losing teeth and hair, and still no break in the clouds.    And now, what do *you* think? Do you agree that it is AN ABSOLUTE CORKER?

B000000YNZ|5.0|\\"Moon Beams\\" was recorded a year after the unfortunate death of fellow bandmate and bassist for Evans' now classic trio, Scott LaFaro. I think Evans' music changed after LaFaro's death and this recording represents a heartfelt dedication and a closure to the past. Evans is joined by Chuck Israels on bass and Paul Motian (from his classic trio with LaFaro). I love this recording and I think in order to fully appreciate it you have to forget about those trio recordings he did years prior and listen to it for what it is: heart-breakingly beautiful music played by a master pianist in his prime. Highly recommended.

Perhaps just a sign of the times and my own personal taste, I put the book down after reading only half of it.

This is the 3rd soundtrack/score that I've purchased in the hopes of having this tune as it was in the movie.  It looks like my only option is to somehow have the music ripped from the DVD itself.
B001EOQWEO|4.0|The set works.  The movie was more than enjoyable, it had a timely message and a heart-tugging story.  I haven't seen the second disc which holds a lot of extras, but the third disc is a digitized version of the movie which I was able to download to my harddrive--however, when I tried to transfer it to my new iPod Touch (which did have enough room)it wouldn't transfer.  I might have to call iTunes to find out what is happening with it.  I tend to believe first that I missed something rather than having a defect in the product.  I do recommend the movie and have enjoyed it more than once already.  The dialogue is something that takes a few times to hear to catch all the great lines.

B0000B1OGD|5.0|I've seen clips of Gwangi since I was just a little kid, and everytime it made me want to see it. I could never find it, and now I finally have.<br />Since I hadn't seen more than some scenes of Gwangi fighting cowboys, dinosaurs etc. I didn't really know much about it. I knew the claymation dinosaurs would be fantastic, but I wasn't sure about the storyline. I expected it to be terrible and not even worth a laugh, but it had more substance than I had thought. Of course it was still funnier than serious, but after watching it a few times, I sorta got a new view of this film. It's all visuals, i knew that, but I hadn't realized how good and how smooth the claymation FX were. The storyline was nothing special. But the way Ray Harryhausen brang Gwangi and all the other creatures to life was amazing. After exploring more about the making of this film, I was even more bewildered at how they did the lassoing sequence, and Gwangi's transport box.<br />If your a sci fi movie fan that loves Harryhausen's work and doesn't mind some crazy cowboys thrown into the mix, you should buy it, despite the prices!

0142412147|4.0|When one thinks of Christmas, images of sparkling snowfalls, traditional family dinners and children dreaming of the shiny presents that Santa might bring probably come to mind. Today's holiday season, however, is sometimes more stressful than joyful. Fortunately, reading LET IT SNOW, a collection of interconnecting Christmas-themed stories by John Green, Maureen Johnson and Lauren Myracle, is one such stress-reducer.    The festivities begin with Maureen Johnson's \\"The Jubilee's Express.\\" Since before Jubilee (Julie) Dougal was born, her parents have been collectors of the Flobie Santa Village --- a relatively harmless hobby, to say the least (despite the fact that they named their daughter after one of the Flobie buildings and inadvertently created, in Julie's opinion, \\"a stripper's name\\"). However, when her mom and dad are arrested at a Flobie convention and she has to miss spending Christmas Eve with her boyfriend Noah, Julie thinks that this Christmas couldn't get any worse.    Unfortunately, while traveling by train to Florida to spend Christmas with her grandparents, \\"the biggest snowstorm in fifty years\\" arrives, and Julie find herself stranded in a place called Gracetown along with a heartbroken stranger, a team of (rather annoying) cheerleaders, and The Tin Foil Guy at the local Waffle House. Hope is not lost yet, however, when a nice local Target employee named Stuart invites her to spend Christmas with him and his family. But achieving the goal of having a memorable holiday by hiking through a blizzard might be easier said than done.    In John Green's \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle,\\" Tobin and his two friends, the Duke (whose real name is Angie) and JP, are enjoying a James Bond movie marathon when they receive a startling phone call and hear about the odd situation (or, according to strange and overly enthusiastic teenage guys, \\"a miracle\\") at the Waffle House. For different reasons, the three embark on a wild adventure that involves lots of snow, afew crazy and (possibly homicidal) adversaries and a much sought-after game of Twister. In the midst of it all, they question their sanity and discover love.    Last but not least is Lauren Myracle's \\"The Patron Saint of Pigs.\\" Upset over causing the breakup with her quiet-mannered boyfriend Jeb, Addie is not having a very happy Christmas. Her friends, Dorrie and Tegan, express concern but think she is a little too self-absorbed. Surprised and determined to change for the better, Addie takes on the task of granting Tegan's Christmas wish. However, the pink-haired barista has her work cut out for her when a rather eventful day at Starbucks threatens to get in the way of her mission.    Whether a longtime fan or just discovering their work (like myself), readers will understand why John Green, Maureen Johnson and Lauren Myracle are three of today's bestselling YA authors (even if the writing trio are apparently having a little friendly feud*). With heartwarming amusement and plenty of cringe-worthy moments, LET IT SNOW is a great book for older readers who want to enjoy a good laugh at the absurdities of the holiday season.    --- Reviewed Sarah Sawtelle

0765348780|1.0|Gardens of the Moon feels like it was originally a 10,000 page book, then there was a fire, and only 666 pages were saved.  The book covers generations and talks about past battles decades ago.  It feels like there are about 45 main characters and a good chunk of them die or just disappear from the book completely... and this is all in the first 80 pages. Then some gods show up and undo what has already been done, leaving you with a feeling that the writer is just going to do whatever he wants.    As soon as you start feeling for a character or getting a sense of what's going on, the book skips years ahead and just starts over at some random point with completely new characters.      After a few hundred pages of this, you just stop caring.  I wanted to throw this book into a fire place in order to burn the last 666 pages.    You may like this book if you're into digging through pages of text like an archeologist, trying to decipher some sort of meaning from it.  But if you want a sensible plot in chronological order, with strong characters, look elsewhere.  No attempt is made to highlight what is important, either.  Instead, you'll be digging for clues to what may be a plotline.  5% of the time, you might actually find one.    To be fair, Erickson's writing style is very descriptive, but his narrative keeps clashing with his urge to tell a hundred year history of his world.  If this book was a collection of short stories, that may have worked better.    Note:  I loved the first 3 George RR Martin books.  They are complex and deep with tons of characters and I had no problem following those books.  However, with Gardens of the Moon, I felt like I had to draw diagrams and take 200 pages of notes in order to follow a pointless story.      Note: Feist skips around, too, but he has solid main characters that help ground his story and keep the reader interested.    I've heard Erickson's later books are better, but this one is a mess.  If you like character driven stories,you probably won't be able to finish this book.  If you're REALLY REALLY into massive fantasy worlds, then you will probably enjoy this book.

B000000OAA|5.0|Quite how Queen managed to produce another masterpiece after Queen II beggars belief, when some bands faff around for 3 years producing a half decent album.    For masterpiece this truly is.  It expands on Queen II, whilst keeping the incredible dynamics of their truly unique sound.  No other band at the time sounded like Queen - no hard rock act, no prog rock act, no pop rock act, no glam rock act.  Queen incorporate all those \\"rock\\" sounds - and more - into their repertoire and sound like...er well... Queen.   If they had influences, then they were swamped and surpassed by the sheer talent on this record.    I've said this before on my review of Queen II but no other band knew how to take a hard rock sound and and use the dynamics to create such an unbelievable and amazing presence.   People think \\"Bo Rhap\\" was almost a bit of a novelty in its classical pretensions, but early Queen to my untrained ear is a band taking all the light and shade of classical music and pumping it through a rock adrenaline rush.    If anything the hit \\"Killer Queen\\" is a throwaway track.  Just listen to the majestic pyrotechnics of \\"Brighton Rock\\" or the truly sublime ballads and it puts everything else in perspective.   Freddie's voice is magnificent, Brian May's guitar playing like nothing else and the ensemble playing mind-blowing.    I have a huge soft spot for early Queen it must be said - not too keen on the later power pop stuff - and this album absolutely hits home.

The spoken words in between various songs are so quiet that it's impossible to hear what she's saying without turning up the volume.<br /><br />The audience screaming and applauding come through quite well, unfortunately.<br /><br />I was so disappointed with this CD. The songs are great, but they're also very soft in the recordings and I need to boost the volume (again) when playing them in a mix with other recordings.<br /><br />If you want a collection of her CDs, skip this one and stick with the studio recordings.

B000056HE9|4.0|Released by producer Samuel Goldwyn as a feel-good follow-up to his postwar classic, [[ASIN:0792846133 The Best Years of Our Lives]], this 1947 film amounts to nice, warm-hearted Christmas fare which takes a subtle jab at organized religion in face of pure faith. Written by Leonardo Bercovici and Robert E. Sherwood (who penned [[ASIN:0792846133 The Best Years of Our Lives]]), the plot concerns Henry Brougham, a young, well-intentioned bishop who has set the goal of building a big cathedral in his parish but cannot convince his rich patrons to give him the financial backing to build it. Praying for guidance, he is startled by the appearance of Dudley, who turns out to be an angel sent to lend Henry a helping hand in realizing his dream. The rest of the movie focuses on how Dudley teaches Henry and his put-upon wife Julia what happiness really means.<br /><br />Originally, Cary Grant and David Niven were cast as Henry and Dudley respectively, but they switched roles upon Goldwyn's insistence when he fired the original director. Under Henry Koster's direction, the film has the necessary whimsical tone, and the casting switch turns out to be fruitful. Grant is an uncomplicated charmer as Dudley, while Niven applies just the right amount of envy-driven starch and humility as Henry. As Julia, Loretta Young can be sweetly affecting, but as written, the character is rather dull considering how both men appear to vie for her affections. A strong supporting cast helps add texture to the story - Gladys Cooper ([[ASIN:630522577X My Fair Lady]]) as rich, ruthless Mrs. Hamilton, the Scrooge figure who wants the cathedral to become a memorial to her dead husband; Monty Woolley ([[ASIN:B000EU1Q1S The Man Who Came to Dinner]]) as agnostic Professor Wutheridge; Elsa Lanchester ([[ASIN:B00005PJ6Z Witness For the Prosecution]]) as dotty housekeeper Matilda; and James Gleason ([[ASIN:B000KX0IOU Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]) as kind-hearted cabbie Sylvester.<br /><br />Some scenes are intentionally fanciful, especially those that showcase Dudley's preternatural abilities on the ice rink and with a harp. However, you just have to let go of such contrivances for the sake of the fantasy aspects of the tale. That's why the movie plays much better during the holidays when wishful thinking becomes near-epidemic. It's also the type of movie that elicits warm chuckles rather than outright guffaws and as such, seems perilously long at 109 minutes. Also worth mentioning are the crisp black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland ([[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane]]) and the stirring, inspirational score by composer Hugo Friedhofer. The 2001 DVD contains no significant extra features.especially those that showcase Dudley's preternatural abilities on the ice rink and with a harp.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I recently bought the movie and LOVED the music in it so decided to buy the soundtrack. The soundtrack is amazing. Every song in the movie is on the soundtrack. Definately a good purchase.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I was kind of expecting more from this CD.  The Paramore songs were good, but I felt that Alternative Rock didn't really suit the Twilight theme and I am not really a big fan of it either.  I bought the CD thinking it would be good, but I'm disappointed.
0312382464|5.0|This is the second book in a trilogy.  A wonderful follow up to Here Be Dragons.  The saga continues in Falls the Shadow and gives the readers a glimpse into the medieval history of England and its sappy King Henry. It took me longer to read this second book, but it was still wonderfully packed with intense battles and love and loss. I just loved reading about Simon and Nell and the de Montfort family and learning about their history on every page.  Another success by SKP and a definite recommended read!

B001GQSY5U|4.0|Bueno, Star Wars es una franquicia que no amerita discusion. Clone Wars es una historia mas larga y la mejor manera de eternizar la tan querida saga profundizando en los hechos que hicieron de Anakin Skywalker lo que luego fue: Darth Vader. Sin duda buenos discos, buena trama, volviendo a lo que siempre ha sido Star Wars.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I haven't had a late or mis-directed purchase from Amazon as of yet.  Keep up the good work.  The products I purchased were exactly as touted.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Excelente, ha valido la pena cada centavo, aun comprandola a destiempo. Daniel Craig tal vez no sea uno de los mas representativos James Bond, pero si uno de los mas activos y audaces. Sin duda, una gran pelicula, digna de los inicios de James Bond...
B001ED7C58|5.0|At first I wasn't really sure about most of the songs on this album--- particularly the Muse track (as the whiney voice really turned me off). However, I still had to wait a week before the movie came out and I had time to kill so I listened to it over and over. You know, it REALLY grew on me and now I listen to it from beginning to end without skipping any of the songs. (OK sometimes I skip Rob's song, but that song really doesn't fit!)    My absolute favorites are Paramore's \\"Caught Myself\\" and the Blue Foundation song. I can (and have) listened to them over and over again.    The Muse song is now super fun (particularly after seeing the movie-- it was used in my fave scene in the movie-- the baseball scene). The Linkin Park song is nice, as is the other Paramore song. I could do without the Perry Farrel song, but oh well, it's there and so I listen to it ;)    I really love this album even though it took me a few listens to really get into it. Had it been any other soundtrack (I'm obsessed with TW!), I probably wouldn't have given it this much attention ;)
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Very well satisfied with service.  Was surprised how fast I received the dvd.  Would recommend this service.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This pre-ordered Christmas item was received from Amazon pretty promptly upon release and in great condition.  It is also noted that they credited our account with an extra $2 because it released at a lower price than we were initially charged.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I think this was a good choice for the price and the movie. I couldn't afford the 2 disc version, but it was every bit as entertaining as I would like it to be. It still had extras that I like to see. I'm not that big on blu ray technology. I just want what I got. A great action packed movie plus a little bit more! Great buy!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia is great for the entire family and I love Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan (and his courageous singing!) and Colin Firth. It made me laugh so much and I feel happy watching the wonderful relationship between the mother and daughter unfold. I cannot get enough of ABBA songs and singing along to this movie with my girlfriends was a BLAST! This movie is totally worth the money!

B001ED7C58|4.0|Since I am a fan of the book series, I wanted to LOVE the cd.  I have to say there are a few songs that I loved the first time around, however the others had to grow on me.  This was probably the first movie cd that I purchased beforehand so I recognized the songs.    The song that Robert Pattinson wrote and performed is amazing!  It does not sound like him at all.    I was lucky and received the insert with Edward on it - each cd contains  I believe 1 of 5 different inserts.    Overall I think I may have given it more of a chance since I was a fan, but for others you may want to listen to a few songs before you purchase the cd.
0307269752|4.0|Since many reviews of this book already explain very well the plot and characters, I'll avoid going into too much detail about all that and just set out the reasons I liked this book.  First of all, I seldom read mysteries anymore, although I read them when I was younger, primarily because I find them often too predictable and full of sterertypical characters and plot lines.  However, this book intrigued me because, from what I read about it, it was different -- a mystery with many twists, few stereotypes.<br /><br />I found that, once I became involved in the story (and I tried not to let the complexity of the details -- and there are many -- intimidate me) I was hooked.  The characters -- Mikael, Lisbeth and even the members of the sometimes repulsive Vanger Clan -- were interesting and I cared about what happened next to all of them, even the rotten ones.<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of a young girl 40 years before, the obsession of her uncle that led to his hiring a shamed journalist to solve the mystery in hopes that he could thus allow himself to die in peace, the complexity of the world the Vanger family created and lived in, to say nothing of the dark details of Lisbeth's existence and the society which gives rise to greed and violence -- all of these elements were fascinating and woven together with imagination and intelligence.<br /><br />This is a mystery with some depth, that sharply comments on man's tendencies to evil, as well as to good.  The dark underside of life moves constantly below the surface, often breaking through in horrible fashion.<br /><br />Once the story gets going, the reader will find his mind engaged and working overtime.  I decided not to worry that I didn't always know which Vanger was which -- it all worked out, ultimately.  The business dealings, Nazi-esque elements, the suspense and the slow unraveling of the tale all worked together to make a fascinating morality tale, as well an entertaining yarn.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a character unlike any I've seen in a long time.  Her complexity and vulnerability do battle with her raw courage and cynicism and she is as sympathetic as a tough tattooed young woman with multiple body piercings can be.  She is hard to get to know, but I found myself wanting to understand her.  Her story is key to the meaning of the whole book, I feel.<br /><br />I recommend this, especially to anyone who loves a mystery with complexity and depth.  Much fun, yet thought-provoking.

B001C08RHA|4.0|\\"Iron Man\\" entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr.  While his song \\"Your Move\\" from the 4-year old CD [[ASIN:B00064AFK0 The Futurist]] is just now in my personal top ten sounding like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of \\"Iron Man\\" for my rainy day video shelf.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for \\"Chaplin\\" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's \\"Ally McBeal.\\"  As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience.  I understood why Jeff Bridges' character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasn't altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.  Perhaps it was jealousy.  The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.  There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998's [[ASIN:B00000JGOH Shakespeare in Love]].  Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash (Widescreen Edition)]] and his Oscar-nominated role in [[ASIN:B000BITUWU Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)]].  Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning \\"Crash\\" as the Iranian store clerk.  In captivity, Stark meets Toub's Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.  John Favreau who is currently acting in \\"Four Christmases\\" directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck.  This is a great action/special effects picture.  Enjoy!
3822856282|5.0|The subtitle of this book from German legend, Uwe Ommer is, Sexy Self-Portraits by Everyday Women. The \\"everyday\\" women include an array of students, models, dancers, artists, actors, teachers, and so forth. They are for the most part a very photogenic and attractive bunch. Some are breathtakingly beautiful. So, if the casual viewer is expecting a book of average, ordinary, girl-next-door types he might be let down. But only for a moment, for this is a thrilling collection of nudes. Each shot is a self-portrait. Admittedly, Ommer assisted in helping create the final product by providing the camera and occasionally lending some technical assistance. But each subject composed a picture that represented the sexy siren that dwells within her. Sometimes the result are brilliant. And there is an indefinable quality to many of the shots here that make this one of most engaging and inspiring book of nudes published in recent times. Perhaps some of the magic rubbed off from Mr. Ommer himself. His recent book, 1000 Families, published in 2002 by Taschen jettisoned Ommer to the thresholds of genius.    Do it Yourself is 256 pages of sheer magic that everyone will love. The only flaw is that this book is not twice the size of its final production. 500 pages would not have been enough. One can only dream of the beauty edited from the final selection.
0307383415|5.0|Very well written and so wise and introspective for someone who was only in his 30s at the time.  My favorite part is when he visits Kenya and meets people living in poverty.  Like people he has met living in poverty in Indonesia, Hawaii, New York or Chicago, some have a hopeful look and some have a desperate look.  Obama looks for similarities between people in similar conditions regardless of where they live.  We are so lucky to have a President who sees desperation as a result of poverty, not its cause.
031606792X|5.0|I'm a big Twilight Fan. I really like how she switched between Bella and Jacob's point of view in this one. I'm getting married next year and I've already told my fiance that I want a similar honeymoon. Parts of it were kind of predictable, at least to me. The big battle kind of annoyed me, I can't really describe why.  This was a real page turner, yet I drew out my reading of it because I didn't want it to end. I've very sad to see the series end.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like this video. I generally road bike in the summer about 15-20 miles a day on really hilly terrain. In the winter I am unable to do that because of wintry conditions and this workout helps keep me in really great shape. Definitely a challenging and intense workout.

B00008WT5J|4.0|When AC/DC superfan writer Stephen King did his first and only turn in the director's chair for [[ASIN:B00030AZCK Maximum Overdrive]], he used some of his clout to approach AC/DC for some rocking soundtrack songs. The Aussies approved, offering him six previously released studio tracks and three new songs (plus incidental riffs never on CD). It's worth noting that AC/DC was in something of a commercial slump at this time, so the results were cobbled together as a soundtrack/pseudo-greatest hits. Then a funny thing happened. The rousing anthem of a title track began to break on radio, the movie (a b-level horror film where angry trucks take over the world) did moderately well, and \\"Who Made Who\\" became AC/DC's first US platinum album in 5 years.<br /><br />Essentially a quickie primer to the band, \\"Who Made Who\\" contains three seminal AC/DC tracks in \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" from [[ASIN:B000089RV6 Back in Black]] and the title track from [[ASIN:B00008WT5G For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]. A pair of songs from [[ASIN:B00009MGR3 Fly on the Wall]] show up, plus one Bon Scott era track (\\"Ride On\\"). There are a pair of new instrumentals that are forgettable. If you're looking for a quickie AC/DC set, this is fine, and the Vanda/Young produced title song makes it worth it. But really, any given AC/DC album prior to 1984 will suit you fine, or even the new \\"Black Ice.\\"
B000LC55F2|5.0|100 years ago, there were two fledgling magicians.  Both Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the plants in an audience who help a magician with his final act.  But one night things turn deadly, leaving Robert a widower and breaking apart the two men.<br /><br />Over the years, they keep tabs on each other and try to hurt each other.  That's how Robert knows when Alfred premiers his most phenomenal trick, the transported man.  In this trick, Alfred moves from one box to another across the stage in one second flat.  Robert becomes obsessed with learning how his rival does the trick, an obsession he takes to unhealthy levels.  Who is the ultimate magician?  Will Robert learn the secret of the transported man?  What lengths will he go to attempting to get the secret?<br /><br />Frankly, that summary does the movie an injustice.  It is more a character study of the two men than anything else.  The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, yet once I got the characters established in my mind, it was very easy to follow.<br /><br />This isn't my normal light film.  In fact, it is very dark at times.  But the story is so engrossing.  I was lost in the world unsure who to root for to win.  In fact, I gave up trying to predict the outcome, and it's a good thing I did because I never would have guessed how it ended.<br /><br />The acting from every single member of the cast is great.  I can't single anyone out, that's how good it is.<br /><br />And this is definitely a movie to own.  There are so many scenes that appear to mean one thing but really mean something else that you need to watch it again.<br /><br />I am sorry I am just now watching this excellent film.  If you've missed it, go out and see it today.  I can't recommend this film highly enough.
B00197POXG|5.0|This product was as advertised - the complete set.  While I feel the price for the item is outrageous, my daughter wanted it for Christmas, so we got it.

B001FBIPF0|4.0|I want to start by saying that this is a very enjoyable album, but Folie A Deux finds our heroes, the emo kings, embracing their melodic sensibility a little more tightly than some of their long time fans might like.  Piano chords (!) can be heard ringing through at times, and power chords are occasionally left to linger in almost power pop fashion.  To be sure, crunchy guitars with plenty of fuzz still are apparent, but the tunes are toe tapping, sometimes downright pretty, and definitely very catchy.  Wentz's base is insistent, slamming its way around the melody line, sublimely funky, and backed up by a stomping rhythm section.  Instrumentation is actually a little adventurous, and the entire affair brings to mind Panic! At the Disco's  \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" more than just a little bit. Personally, I think that is pretty high praise, but I'm not sure that everyone who loves Fall Out Boy is going to feel the same way.        The stuff you have come to love is still here, never fear.  Patrick's ever shaky vocal charms are the centerpiece of most of the songs.  He sings, whines, pleads, and then boldly slides all around his range, which appears to be widening over time.  He is more confident here than before, and that says a lot.  He takes a lot of chances vocally, with some impressive harmonies and generally very strong vocal lines.  I think that this album is his most listenable performance, but once more, I know that not all Fall Out Boy fans want things to be too listenable.    From a lyrical perspective, it has always been a little hard to know when Fall Out Boy are telling us like it is, letting us in on what is really on their hearts, or when they are throwing out blythe redirects as facade for a deeper hurt that maybe they don't want to reveal.  \\"I'd promise you anything for another shot at life\\"  Patrick says, voice full of sincerity on the outstanding opening track, and then he elaborates--\\"Imperfect boys with their perfect ploys/Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy.\\"  Interesting lyrics for one of the biggest names in emo.    Ultimately, then, I love this album.  I confess that I've always enjoyed the melodic poppy side of Fall Out Boy, so this album is actually everything that I have hoped from them.  It is going to disappoint a lot of fans, however, who wanted a little more screaming, a little more fast guitar.  To them I say, with respect, please give this album a chance.  There are definitely some raw moments, and they guys have not forgotten where they come from. The album should grow on everyone who is really willing to give this band a chance.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This miniseries seems to be a powerful and realistic story of John Adam's life and career.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in American history and a look at the early days of our country.  The acting by the main characters is excellent.
0316017922|4.0|In his  books, Malcolm Gladwell always starts with a seemingly simple question and tries to address it by creating a theory. MG is very good at synthesizing ideas and explaining them in a simple theory. In this book, He explains why \\"success\\" (in hockey, entrepreneurship, maths, school, etc.) is not only the result of intelligence or innate abilities but also of luck, environment and hard work. On the negative side, this book is  not as well written as his other books (Tipping Point) and his arguments are not always bullet proof.
6305558167|5.0|John Boorman is a hard director to pin down.  He can do a gritty crime drama like POINT BLANK with Lee Marvin and then he does a film like this! EXCALIBUR is the finest Arthur film of them all.  Forget KING ARTHUR, forget FIRST KNIGHT or even CAMELOT, THIS IS THE ONE.  A wonderful cast, including a young Helen Murren as Morgana, Nigel Terry as Arthur.  Best performance has to be Nicol Williamson as Merlin.  Look for a pre-Picard Patrick Stewart.  Beautifully filmed with a truly majestic score, the only film of this type to come close is probably Richard Donner's LADYHAWKE.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Having written quite a few reviews on Amazon over the years, I've gotten rather strict with what products I give five stars.  One recent exception to my new, stricter rule is Dreamworks' \\"Kung Fu Panda.\\"  My wife took our daughter to see this at the movies while I stayed at home with our youngest child.  I must admit that I envied my wife when she walked out of the house to see the film, for it had peaked my interest with its commercials and trailers.  When it arrived on DVD, my wife picked it up for the whole family.  She stated that she really enjoyed the film.  This was a good sign for me since my wife isn't into many animated films.<br /><br />From the wonderful opening \\"dream sequence\\" to the climactic battle with Tai Lung, \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" doesn't disappoint at all.  It's the story of Po (Jack Black), an overweight, clumsy panda who longs to become a great kung fu master like the legendary Furious Five.  Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has guided the Furious Five for many years and has literally raised them to be great fighting machines.  Only one student fell to the wayside under Shifu, and that was the wicked (and imprisoned) Tai Lung (Ian McShane).  Tai Lung thinks he deserves to be the dragon warrior and therefore the only person wise and powerful enough to learn the secrets of the dragon scroll.<br /><br />When Po is named as the dragon warrior (much to the surprise of Shifu and the Furious Five), Tai Lung escapes his prison in order to claim what he feels is rightfully his.  Shifu and the Five must prepare Po for the greatest battle of his life.  Can they do it?  You'll have to watch this hilarious family flick to find out.<br /><br />Black is great as Po.  He fits into the clumsy, plus-sized role perfectly.  The Furious Five consists of the voice talents of Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Seth Rogen (Mantis), David Cross (Crane) and Angelina Jolie (Tigress).  Each of the group is given a nice amount of screen time and they make wonderful straight men to the goofy Po.  McShane and Hoffman are also excellent in their roles.  Listen for more highly recognizable voices in smaller roles in the film as well.<br /><br />What makes \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" worthy of five stars is the fact that it manages to be a family friendly film with great comedy, brilliant animation and heart-stopping action sequences.  Honestly, some of the best fight sequences I've ever witnessed are in this film.  My particular favorite is a showdown between the Five and Tai Lung.  There's also the solid lesson of believing in oneself in order to achieve your dreams, no matter how far-fetched they might be.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" to anyone who enjoys a great family film, comedy or action flick.  It covers all of those bases and is well worth multiple viewings.  Once again, I highly recommend this film and suggest you purchase a copy for yourself.McShane and Hoffman are also excellent in their roles.

B0008JFMEC|5.0|This review is for; [[ASIN:B0008JFMEC Kill Bill - Volume 1 [UMD for PSP]]]<br /><br />If I only had one choice of movie to get for my PSP it would definitely be \\"Kill Bill\\"! Selection of UMD movies is very scarce, hard to find and are sometimes expensive due to limited availability. Although there are a good number of other movie titles available on UMD (such as \\"Enter the Dragon\\", & \\"The Matrix\\"), I really think most of them aren't so good or are \\"hit and miss\\" selections. As of 12-16-08, it is uncertain and rather bleak about the future of UMD titles that are going to be available for 2009 and beyond. A new PSP without a UMD drive will be released in the future.<br /><br />The \\"Kill Bill\\" volume one is a very good movie to get on UMD, is enjoyable with multiple viewings and is one of the few UMD movies with special features. Not much special features. Just a couple. One is the making of \\"Kill Bill\\" (22 minutes) which is your standard cast, crew interviews mixed with some film and behind-the scenes footage. The other feature is a six minute music video by 5, 6, 7 & 8 (four Asian females dressed in beige dresses) singing the song \\"Woo-Hoo\\". Of course if you get \\"Kill Bill\\" volume one, you probably be obligated to get volume two like I did. Volume two has only a few deleted scenes as the only special feature on that UMD.
B00004YZFR|5.0|On my DVD shelf, this little music doc is filed in the Horror section, right between \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"The Ring.\\" Because this is one of the scariest things I've ever seen, perhaps because I'm not big on crowds, but still... for very good reason the name \\"Altamont\\" still delivers a shiver even in these days when pop princesses prance on stages 12 feet high in boxes of bulletproof glass while the rest of us dance alone in our rooms with our ipods. Okay, okay, I'm not saying that good live music does not exist anymore, but it's still boggles the mind to think that once the biggest band in the world thought it would be a great thing to give a free concert for a gazillion people on a stage 2 feet high and have the Hell's Angel's provide \\"security.\\"  The resulting murderous mayhem irrevocably disproved the goofy idea that a congregation of people f%$#ed up on hallucinogenic drugs will inevitably facilitate a beautiful fellowship of love and peace.  The sad realization of that fact slowly and horribly unfolds during the film's narrative, and the impact of it punches the gut even 39-odd years after the fact. The documentation of this deeply misguided concert event simply pulsates with bad juju from the get-go.  Menace seems to hang heavy in the morning air, and things get out-of-control very early -- the instant the frisbees start flying all hell seems about to break loose. The sheer massiveness of that surly, churning crowd next to the comparative tininess of the stage and the musicians on it is stunning as the violence erupts periodically, and increasingly, throughout the day.  From a bewildered and frightened Gram Parsons pleading, \\"Please people please stop hurting each other!\\" to the infamous beating of Marty Balin (and Grace Slick attempting to soothe the crazed crowd with a rhythmic chant of \\"Easy, easy\\") to the culminating Boschian nightmare of glassy-eyed, horribly naked freaks climbing the stage to (seemingly) rip Mick and Keith apart as they perform a strangely turgid \\"Under My Thumb\\" -- this is one BAD TRIP.  Of course, it goes without saying that this was made at the height of The Stones' beauty and brilliance as a band, and the early concert scenes from New York shows and the recording of \\"Wild Horses\\" are wonderful. Still this film will go down pretty hard in the end, especially for us sensitive types.  A Must See but I highly recommend having a copy of \\"Jazz on a Summer Day\\" as an immediate antidote afterwards.y turgid \\"Under My Thumb\\" -- this is one BAD TRIP.

B001J53X9U|2.0|First off this is a review of this particular special edition not of the movie, which I thought was great.    While the case looked okay in the picture, I had assumed that this movie would also come with a normal blu ray case (keeping a little batpod with all your Blu Ray movies isn't a great option in many setups).    That said, I wouldn't have minded it if the batpod seemed to be of decent quality -- either durable plastic or metal. Instead I got a very cheap poorly painted flimsy plastic model. Apply any pressure to any part of this model and it will just bend. I wasn't expecting a super high quality model, but at $50 I was expecting something that I wouldn't be embarrassed to stick by my TV and blu ray player.    Oh and the digital copy comes in a separate cardboard insert (I'm not sure where you are supposed to store this).    All said, save yourself the money and buy the normal blu ray edition with the same bonus discs. You can still probably come out ahead if you bought a bat pod toy separate, and it would be better quality than the one that came with this.    My best comparison would be a $5 do it yourself model where you snap the plastic pieces out of sheets and stick them together, along with an average paint job.    Definitely not worth close to $50
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The commentaries accompanying films can range from awful (WALKABOUT) to very good (SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER) to \\"gotta own it\\" (METROPOLIS). The critic who did this commentary obviously knows Lang's work like the back of his hand and does a marvelous job of pointing out the significance of Lang's cinematic choices. I suggest you see it, then watch the commentary version, after which you may want to see it yet again. It's that good!<br />Indidentally, it annoys me that neither Amazon nor Criterion always mentions when a DVD has a commentary and who does it, to me one of the most important reasons for buying a DVD.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|We bought this for my dad for Christmas, so we haven't actually watched it.  But it came quickly and we're excited to give it as a gift.  The reason for 4 stars is I thought I was getting a great deal because it was advertised as $30 off, but later I found it at Costco which regular price was $5 cheaper then what we paid.

B00140PK6O|5.0|Excellent story and screenplay, superbly acted.  A blend of the deeply touching and the humorous.  The charachters are endearing each in their own way.  It starts off a little slow, but stay with it.  Also, this is not for the faint of heart nor the weak of stomach!
B000LE0THO|1.0|Is it just me or do these remastered versions of everything ruin the originals? I`m in my mid 40`s and have many CD`s I purchased in 80`s and 90`s that were recorded off of the original master tapes. They sound exactly as I remembered them on the albums (as it should be). This remaster is one of the worst. If your young enough to never have heard this in it`s original state, then please do so before wasting your money on this!
0307387178|4.0|I purchased this book after watching the movie and, believe me, the book was just as haunting as the movie. The book is written exceptionally well and I found this book difficult to put down. Naturally, I read the book in three days. However, there were parts of the book which did not belong.<br /><br />Krakauer's narratives of others who went into the desert, and especially Krakuaer's own narratives of his personal exploits did not belong in the book. His narratives quickly disrupted the natural flow of the book. I was not intersted in reading about his dad's problems with polio and alcohol. It had no place in the book. Naturally, I skipped that chapter when the story was about Krakauer and not McCandless.<br /><br />This is one of those books that leaves you resting in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering what you would have done in Chris's place. How would you have done things differently? It gave me the inspiration to leave society and try it myself. The book is that good!<br /><br />Just ignore Krakauer's Chapters 14 and 15. Doesn't add to the story at all!

B0015FML06|5.0|I saw U2 in the early hopeful days.  The experience of those shows is very difficult to describe to people who were not there.  This came very close.  U2 really believed in what they were saying and had a commitment to a message rarely paralleled in live entertainment.  This is a sharp contrast to the cynical views of today.  Enjoy!

B00006G8LB|3.0|This movie is two hour and one minute long and was released on May 3, 2002. The movie mainly introduces us to Peter Parker and how Spiderman came to be and how the murder of his Uncle Ben was the main turning point to become the hero Spiderman. We are introduce to the Green Goblin in Spiderman 1. The movie does stay focus; one hero and one villian, unlike Spiderman 3 where we have three villians. The one area this movie lacks is action. There are only two action scenes, maybe one more. When I was watching the video at home, I kept switching the off and on button. I just could not get into this movie.

B00005JMX6|2.0|The Girl Next Door (2004) I tend to enjoy movies where a world wise young woman introduces a naïve young man to life and love. At the same time, I tend to be annoyed by movies that are set in or near the world of adult entertainment while maintaining a PG-13 rating. So, I had not seen this movie even though it has the basic plot layed out in the first sentence, mainly because it tries the feat mentioned in the second sentence. However, I finally gave in and watched after seeing bits and pieces on TV. The filmmakers have obviously seen Risky Business, as the movie follows that film's structure pretty closely throughout its running time. The story has Matthew (Emile Hirsch) a bright, hard working high school senior about to deliver a speech that he's sure will get him the scholarship he needs to go to the college of his choice. Then, his quiet and studious life gets turned upside down when his next door neighbor's niece Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in to house sit while her aunt is away. Danielle pulls Matthew out of his quiet, staid world and in effect introduces him to life. He of course falls head over heels for her. Then the big plot complication rears its head. Matt's pal Eli (Chris Marquette) recognizes Danielle as a star of adult entertainment movies. From there the movie gets kind of flighty and a bit complicated, throwing in Danielle's producer/boyfriend, a charming but also menacing fellow named Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), the foreign student Matt's class is saving up to bring to America, another adult film producer (James Remar) and a trip to a porn convention in Las Vegas. And all of this noise takes away from the simple charms the movie had early on when it was just boy learning how great life is from girl, especially this girl, as Cuthbert is delectable in this role. By the time the lead trio of high schoolers is successfully meandering around that porn convention in Las Vegas with no one stopping them, the film becomes a kind of fantasy fable, and pretty much stays that way through the end of the film. It's watchable, but boy it could have been amazing if they'd built on the promise of the first half hour and kept it a quiet comedy-drama of first love. Oh well. Better luck next time, guys.etty much stays that way through the end of the film.

B000LAZDQA|2.0|John Cameron Mitchell's 'Shortbus' is an interesting treatise on sex and-I guess-love, but that's all it seems to be-interesting. Though the film's intentions are quite admirable and worth a glance, the film fails to be anything but a graphically oversexed diddy with a little heart and a playful wink.    Mitchell's choice to gather as many unknown actors to star in his film was probably a smart move as there would have been no one in Hollywood with the balls-pun intended-to take such risks as these actors have done. However, the reason for these actors to go all the way  just isn't good enough. There's a trapeze act going on in 'Shortbus' that teeters between pornographic and melodramatic. The way the film presents its sexually graphic scenes are done quite naturally and even a bit humorous, but to what advantage? What kind of impression is the audience going to get with all these graphic images being displayed? In the end, it just boils down to two people actually screwing on film (sometimes only one . . . or three!). Now,I for one am not about censoring-especially when it comes to nudity and sexuality, but I have to be honest that even I was shocked and somewhat appalled as to what I saw. I think I probably wouldn't have felt that way if 'Shortbus' just got over its artsy self and call itself porn with a story (which, I'm sorry, isn't anything novel). Do I really need to see a man pleasure himself with his own mouth? If that question there bothered the hell out of you, then you haven't seen anything yet!    Those of you who loved 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', as I did, beware. This is new territory for Mitchell to experiment with and your tolerance to sex and nudity will be tested. I applaud the actors for being so fearless and Mitchell for coming up with a good concept, but perhaps like Todd Haynes's equally interesting experiment, 'I'm Not There', 'Shortbus' only amounts to an interesting concept. I feel that it's defintely worth your time watching at least once.It's no piece of garbage, I assure you. It's just sex afterall.
B000286RNY|5.0|Anybody who gave less than four stars was thinking too much or can't appreciate this kind of humor.  This is a great, one of a kind movie that's light hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously (and neither should you).  I highly recommend this if you want a good laugh.
6305212112|4.0|There is some questionable material but...over all it was entertaining. My wife enjoyed it more then I did. It was ok.
B0017YZII2|5.0|The Sara Bareilles cd, Little Voice is a very emotional cd. I love her voice and all the emotions that her songs bring to me. It is not the cd to listen to when you have recently gone through a break up or a loss of a loved one, because the emotions that she put out there are so strong, you'll find yourself in tears. I am so glad that I purchased this cd and would highly recommend it to everyone. Definately a 5 star!
6305558167|3.0|This movie presents the Arthur movie in terms of the magic sword legend.<br />It modifies Vivian into Morgan Le Fey and takes several other liberties with the traditional plot, but it is well written , played and fun to watch!<br />If you likes knights in armor, sorcery and mythical mystical<br />legend, you'll love this movie.

1577314808|5.0|Can't say enough about the impact this book has had on my life.  Could be because I've had alot of suffering.  This is the type of book that you read a chapter over and over before moving on to the next chapter.  I read this book right after I took a landmark forum course and wow, what an impact it had.  I highly recommend it but you have to want it for it to have the impact.
B000I2MRHE|3.0|It is a neat idea, but I don't think it is worth the price. Unless you find it on sale, it's not worth the money. It's just a piece of fabric with animals on it. You could make the same thing for much cheaper. Like I said, it is a cool toy, but for what you get, it's overpriced.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|ALL of my kids (ages 8, 6, and 3) ADORE this movie.  They wanted me to get the soundtrack so they could listen to it in the car, too.  The singing and dancing are wonderful and easily keep the attention of my wiggly rugrats.  A true must-have family classic that never disappoints.
B00000251N|5.0|This is a wonderful CD at a very reasonable price.  My wife and I heard it while staying at our daughter's home.  My wife knew that it was Neil Diamond singing but it took us a while to find the name of the CD.  It is really very inspirational music.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Now that all of our summer blockbusters have become nothing but comic book super heroes, some of them still deliver a great time.<br /><br />IRON MAN is one of them.<br /><br />I used to get Iron Man comics as a kid but he wasn't as popular and iconic as Superman or Batman.  In fact, I can't remember any of the villains from his comics, but he had a cool suit and the artwork was as topnotch as the best of Marvel during the 70s.<br /><br />The film version definitely has as much to offer as the best of the super hero movie.  The script is tight, the characters are fleshed out, the humor is funny and genuine, the special effects and production values are topnotch.  Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot to the role of Tony Stark and you almost believe the role was written just for him.<br /><br />IRON MAN leaves you wanting more.  And since it made a gigantic pile of money, I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him.<br /><br />Be sure to stick around for a short scene following the end credits (this past summer's THE INCREDIBLE HULK also featured a post-credits scene of Tony Stark popping up as well!).<br /><br />And, was it just me, or did everyone think that was Kris Kristofferson every time Jeff Bridges showed up?
B001GQACGO|5.0|Despite what some may say, this album is an INSTANT CLASSIC! This is the best CD buy I've had in a LONG TIME! Beyonce's range of emotions and vocals make this a win/win double disc CD. Let's start with the \\"I Am...\\" side..<br /><br />On \\"I Am...\\" Beyonce displays her amazing vocal abilities, starting off with If I Were A Boy.  If that was't great enough, the next song (my personal favorite off the \\"I Am...\\" side is Halo, which is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  If you're expecting me to say that the rest are okay, you're wrong. The rest are just as great, giving a wide range for listeners of all types.  Smash Into You, Satellites, Ave Maria, Disappear, Broken-Hearted Girl (amazing) are all inspiring and heartfelt.  Powerful vocal performances thoughout the entire CD.<br /><br />On \\"Sasha Fierce\\" the hit Single Ladies begins the CD off, which is obviously a hit among listeners.  Radio is one of the best lyrical song I've heard in a long time, with very clever words and an amzing beat.  Who can't related. Diva is gonna be every lady's favorite, bringing out the inner Diva in everyone!  If not a lady, the beat is absolutely SICK!!  Ego and Hello are other favorites on the CD, which could both EASILY be singles!  Scared of Lonely is simply amazing, both vocally and lyrically.  Beyonce receives an A+ for this double disc classic
0891419195|4.0|Sledge's book is a must-read for anyone interested in WWII battles against the Japanese. No words are wasted trying to impress the reader.  Instead, this is a first-hand account of an enlisted soldier's harrowing battle experiences.  It does not get any more personal and straight forward than this.  The maps in the book are not very good, so I turned to the internet.  I Googled every mountain, island, ship name, etc. for an immersing reading experience.  You can even use Microsoft's Flight Simulator to fly around the islands.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Wasn't too keen on watching it when it first came out. Last year it came out on tv and I happened to catch some of it. Bought a copy this year to add to my Christmas movie day collection. Some of it is sappy but some of it is down right fun. Tom Hanks is an amazing talent. His ability to wear many hats in this production was quite interesting, and a pleasure, to see. Enjoyed the musical chocolate drink scene, the rollercoaster train ride through mountains and over ice was fun, and the bit right before santa comes out was tense nd magical at the same time. A good movie. I recommend it for any age but most especially for people with kids below the age of 10.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Love this band and this CD.  This CD is one you can take with you everywhere you go and never get sick of it.  The band plays well together and all the music comes together great.  This band doesn't get a ton of coverage but this is definitely a CD that often goes over looked.  Don't pass this up if you like good guitar and drums.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|If you think you know Paul, think again. Who knows if John Lennon would even care enough about music to make anything at all, much less something that sounds like a completely fresh start? We owe this man a debt of gratitude once again. He's still excited about music, and he gives you permission to feel excited again, too. Mind blowing, mystical, bizzare,beautiful,cool. India apparently wasn't as lost on Paul as history would paint it to be. I love this music. Give it a chance. Hooray, Paul. Way to go.

B000Q6GUT8|5.0|This is NOT my usual genre, but I got coaxed into watching it and was very impressed with both Mark Wahlberg and the movie. It was a bit more graphic than I am comfortable with, but I closed my eyes a lot. I was enthralled from the opening frames until the end. I highly recommend it!
B001M3LG84|5.0|Andre Rieu and his amazing show finally made it to Australia in November 08  and the joy on 40 thousand faces was testament to Rieu's style of entertainment.It was a warm Melbourne night and the mammoth stage was spectacular,almost like being in Vienna ,a life size reproduction of the of the Schonbrunn Palace, Overall the content was similar to that of the experience in Vienna , but with a unique Australian flavour , the standout here was Mirusia singing \\"Botany Bay\\",to Australians this is almost like a hymn and there were few dry eyes,as the song echo's the leaving of the Old Motherland in May 1787 and reaching Botany Bay on January 19-20-1788.  There were eleven vessels which carried  about 730 convicts and 250 free settlers all starting life anew in the Unknown land of Australia.  I felt that Andre hit the mark with this,and other Australian content too, and i was also fairly happy with the sound quality given that preforming in huge stadiums of this kind can be very hard from an audio standpoint.   At the time of writing this Dec 16th 08 this DVD is already breaking Australian sales records in the lead up to Christmas.Total running time is 2hours 9mins   so you get a good deal!

B001GKJ2E8|1.0|This movie was just garbage. It bit off of The Matrix. It bit off of Empire Strikes Back (Luke I'm your father), and it bit off of every other crappy action movie that was written by some fan boy. What I mean by that is this. Ok, you are a nerd. You are a geek who hates who he is and hates his life. Everybody picks on you and you are an outcast. But guess what?! Secretly you have super powers! Or you are a super assassin! Or you are really a cool guy! And now you get to live your fan boy wet dream. How many times can they do this same concept. The action was also just ridiculously over the top to the point of being stupid. Angelina Jolie is usually hot but she is so skinny in this movie she looks like a concentration camp victim with makeup and a hair stylist.<br /><br />This movie is just plain bad.

B001DPHDCY|4.0|The right people and the right mood can create some of the best projects.<br />I guess they had all the right ingredients making this movie. All do a<br />great job in giving life to the characters, and a big Kudo to Jim Carrey<br />for his energy in giving Horton life.<br />Good for the kids, enjoyed it a lot as a adult.<br />A Keeper, good for multiple views.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I should avoid reading other people's reviews before writing my own.  I tend to read the worst of what people have to say and often find myself wondering how they could see what they do... most often because they have a vision they think should define what the movie says and does or get caught up in what is possible in OUR world instead of the world the film maker has created.... I really liked this movie.  Instead of a simple premise, predictable dialogue, and a happy ending, we are given all the drama of 8 people trying to stay sane on a long journey coinciding with a suicide mission with a noble goal driving them along.  How many films kill the captain, have one of the crew kill himself, and other calamities? Not many.  Yes, the earth gets its sun, but our cast are all gone with yet so many mysteries of the universe still to be unravelled.
B001ED7C58|5.0|as a huuuuge fan of the books n the film i thought it was only fitting to get the soundtrack, and what a soundtrack, the music fits really well with the film, when i first heard some of the songs i was like \\"erm...ok\\" but its brilliant.    i couldnt get over how fast i got the c.d i was at leats thinking it wouldnt arrive for 3 weeks or more, but i got it the next week.    im soooo happy with it. ;)
0884271536|4.0|This book was not quite as enlightening as The GOAL but was still well worth the investment to read. The idea of critical chain constraints on a project is not new but the idea still has merit and is presented by Goldratt in a way that makes it easy for PMPs and non-project workers alike to understand.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This movie is great in my opinion and it was delivered sooner than I thought.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|A good action movie with some twists that keep you engaged in the story. The story revolves around a group of assassins that have followed the messages of a woven cloth for centuries to determine their targets. This is to keep the balance of power and justice in check. The recruits have the ability to see beyond normal laws of nature and control even the trajectory of a bullet. When a young man is recruited he is told he will kill the man that assassinated his father. The training is grueling and leads him to question his reason for being. Afterall he started as an accountant that was sorry for anything others said was wrong. Well worth at least a rental, and if you enjoy action movies you will probably want to add it to your library. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Hitman\\" and \\"Jumper\\".<br /><br />CA Luster

I also purchased copies of this book as presents for my Dad (retired Army) and brother (active duty Navy).

0066620996|4.0|I picked up this book from the bed and breakfast bookshelf while on vacation. It's not a book I normally would have chosen to read on vacation, but it was well written and was surprisingly engaging for the topic. It's a study of companies that were good companies for awhile (at least 15 years), then became great companies (outperforming the stock market by at least 3x over at least 15 years). What they found in the eleven companies that met the criteria were some interesting and at times counterintuitive tendencies.<br /><br />LEADERSHIP All the companies had what Collins calls \\"Level 5 leaders,\\" or leaders with a rare combination of drive and ambition but a complete lack of ego. These leaders are humble, quick to credit others, and are driven by a desire to create something bigger than themselves as opposed to a monument to themselves. These leaders shun the cult of personality and are very rarely rock-star CEOs. In fact, Collins found no correlation between CEO pay and good-to-great companies.<br /><br />WHO OVER WHAT Good-to-great companies first concern themselves with who they bring on board before decide what needs to be done. The right team can accomplish anything, but even the best game plan will fail if it doesn't have the right people to implement it.<br /><br />CONFRONT THE BRUTAL FACTS The g2g companies had a culture of optimistic realism. They had a culture of trust and honesty, where people were empowered to do their jobs and debate was encouraged. Goals were set high, but they never lost sight of the situation on the ground.<br /><br />THE HEDGEHOG CONCEPT refers to a parable in which a hedgehog constantly foils a fox by repeatedly doing the same simple thing--being a hedgehog. In business, it simply means finding your company's core competency. What can it be best in the world at? What can it make money at? What is it passionate about? Great companies find and stick to that one thing.<br /><br />GOOD TO GREAT also describes the culture of discipline in each company, the adaption to new technology, and the cycles of positive and negative momentum that companies find themselves in. All of these elements work together to create the leap to greatness over time. It's not a singular breakthrough.<br /><br />Scattered throughout the book are great case studies, inspirational stories and insightful quotes. My biggest criticism of the book, or observation, is that a couple of the eleven great companies (Fannie Mae and Circuit City) either forgot what made them great or weren't as sustainable as Collins thought seven years ago. That aside, this was an easy read full of a lot of good insight.technology, and the cycles of positive and negative momentum that companies find themselves in.

B0012V4WSW|5.0|When it comes to Evangelion I am a sucker, or feel like it. I own almost every (English) DVD release and when it came to the Platinum addition I started a love/hate cycle. I liked what I saw, it had some enhancements, but to say it really justified a full new release... \\"Noaye\\" :-)    So when I first learned about this release I had my bias opinion ready. The search for even more money had begun. When I saw the first scenes I was convinced that this was nothing more but a remake in a darker tone (where the Platinum edition seems oversaturated this one almost seems too dark) where seemingly nothing had changed set for some new digital animations and a slightly different (sometimes annoying) soundtrack.  Big deal.    I was wrong. And believe me: after buying the Platinum edition and /still/ wondering if I did the right thing this is not something I'll say easily.    And why?  The original series was very enjoyable and pretty awesome but in many ways it was severly limited in what could be done and displayed. Every die-hard Eva fan knows about the extremely brutal (and highly emotional) episodes \\"Introjection\\" and \\"Ambivilence\\" (Unit 4 going berserk and the most deadly Angel ever entering Nerv HQ) which almost got Eva pulled from the air. Well, if you thought that was something then you have another thing coming. The beginning of the real EVA.    Now, what would make me say these things?  Simple, its extremely enhanced realism, the extremely crisp looking animation, and the much more mature approach. Lets quickly dive into these topics; Realism... It starts to show during the fight with the second angel. Tokyo 3 was said to be a fortress to proect mankind from the Angels. But isn't it funny how the city could basically only retreat and restore the buildings without any means of active defenses? Heck; does it make sense to face an enemy while having its attention solely focussed on yourself? No it doesn't. And so the new Tokyo 3 has online defenses, and many of them! Resulting in attacking Angels who are also being distracted by these defenses.    Another thing; Shinji attacking the 2nd angel, getting his body virtually pierced and going in for the kill after only a quick \\"auch\\" and more screaming? No, not logical. Here we get to see how he basically picks himself up to go for the kill in the final stroke. Piloting an Eva is stressfull, and now it shows!    The 3rd Angel (the diamond) shows the second (added to the first) item; good animation and more realism. Instead of pushing some metal drill (powered by energy) into the ground it now basically twists its own body in. And a laserbeam which can level an armored train, blow up half a mountain, and it only shakes an Eva (with inexperienced pilot) and simply shatters a glass window (Nerv mobile HQ)? I don't think so.. And NOW we really get to see the kind of mental stress which piloting an Eva inflicts. After that ordeal you don't just stand up and pick up where you left off. No sirree.    And finally, the more mature approach. The series always had some nudity here and there, but cleverly covered or darkened enough. Not anymore. The children wear no clothes when putting on the plugsuit and thus that is showing, among other things. Enough details to make the story more realistic because its not forcefully covered up while keeping it to such a minimum that it doesn't make you wonder to have picked up some Evangelion hentai-like release. It simply looks and feels more realistic, and that is all.    This release is worth every penny in my opinion. Personally I'm waiting for the English (probably ADV) release but I'm not anxious for the English dubs anymore. I think now is also a good time to watch this in its original language with English subtitles. Thumbs up for me, 5 star rating. My advice; keep an open mind and try watching pieces before forming your opinion on it. This is different!
B000Y179KO|4.0|Although I am a fan of 'classic' Eagles music, I found their new CD to be almost as enjoyable.  The harmonizing of Don Henley and Glen Frey is never amiss. This CD brings in a taste of a more contemporary sound every so often.  The title track is wonderful.    So much, so different.  Several songs give you the impression that they have travelled from their early years of hard living to becoming earthy-crunchy bark eaters.  All in all, a great CD as would be expected from such a seasoned group. If you're looking for the Eagles you used to know you might be a little disappointed, but if you're looking for a little change on an old favorite, you've found your CD.

I was pleasantly surprised that each movie came with a second disk that has behind the scenes and interviews.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|I remember this movie as a young boy sitting up one night and watching it on the family's B&W TV. What impressed me most was the invisible monster, and the vast underground complex of machines (and maybe Anne Francis' legs!). It was science of The Future, and it never lost it's hold on me.<br />So this satisfying DVD set came at a good time for myself, at an age where I can appreciate the art and technology (and Anne Francis' legs!) that went into it's production. As a hard-core science fiction fan, and appreciative of it's Shakespeare, I can relate to the thought and care that this film enjoys. The features added to the collection are great to view, with Robbie the Robot as the centerpiece of attention.<br />In all, I got a pretty good deal for the price, and am satisfied with the films. Maybe, as some say, more could have been done to make this a collector's edition, but this is a '50's movie people. We're lucky we got as much as we did. And the movie?..Still fascinating after all these years.

B001GQSY64|3.0|I want to start by saying I'm one of those nostalgic fans who saw \\"Return of the Jedi\\" at the movie theater when released back in '83. Since then I have been a fan of the saga, even the special editions and the prequel trilogy, with all their flaws.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Jabba's son kidnapped by Count Dooku, since the Jedi are negotiating with Jabba for safe passage through his territory, he intends to use this against the Jedi and blame them on kidnapping the Hutt's son. The story may work for a TV show (as was originally intended) but it clearly doesn't work for film. Add to that the amount of liberties taken with characters and story and the movie fails to deliver, it is not bad, but doesn't feel like Star Wars. Out of nowhere Anakin now has a Padawan learner called Ahsoka, they call each other \\"Skyguy\\" and \\"Snips\\" during the whole movie, Jabba's son is never called by his name but \\"Stinky\\" instead, his father calls him \\"Punky Muffin\\"... you get the picture. If that weren't enough, while the classic star wars music themes are present, they have been rearranged and new music has been composed for it, a huge part of the star wars universe was the incredible and epic score wrote by John Williams, and that's gone too.<br /><br />The movie (and the series) does not follow the line from the previous work by Genndy Tartakovsky, which told separate stories of the clone wars from different perspectives as this one now focuses more in the relationship of Anakin and his recently found Padawan learner. The animation is average if compared with other releases (for example ANY Pixar film) and the designs are cool, as explained in one of the documentaries, the idea was to have a mixture from the designs used in Tartakovsky's work with the Thunderbird-like marionettes.<br /><br />I have to admit this looks and sounds amazing on Bluray, after watching the first episodes of the show the movie makes more sense than when I first watched it, in the end, it's Star Wars... I have watched the movie and the episodes with my little kid and he seems to enjoy them very much, obviously, the target audience for this movie and the new TV show are not the fans from old but the younger audiences discovering Star Wars for their first time...movie and the episodes with my little kid and he seems to enjoy them very much, obviously, the target audience for this movie and the new TV show are not the fans from old but the younger audiences discovering Star Wars for their first time...

B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Mama Mia! Not That Bad, Actually<br /><br />By Kristin Battestella<br /><br />When I had the opportunity to see Mama Mia! in theaters, I was a little reluctant to go. Despite being a big Bee Gees fan, I don't care for Abba all that much, and I'm not into newer musical chick flicks. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, I kind of liked Mama Mia!.<br /><br />As young Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) readies for her marriage to Sky (Dominic Cooper) on the Greek island of Skopelos, she confesses to her best friends Ali (Ashley Lilly) and Lisa (Rachel McDowall) that she's invited her three prospective fathers to the wedding- unbeknownst to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Donna's friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) come for the festivities and help Donna relive her glory days when she discovers her previous lovers are close at hand. Who is Sophie's Dad? Rogue Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), uptight Harry (Colin Firth), or divorcee Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?<br /><br />Each major cast member gets a lead turn at the music. Tony winner Christine Baranski (Chicago, Cybill) and Julie Walters (Harry Potter) could steal the show with `Does Your Mother Know' and `Take A chance on Me', respectively, if it were not for Streep's taking down the house with `The Winner Takes It All'. I knew the 14 time Oscar nominee (twice a winner with Kramer vs Kramer and Sophie's Choice) could carry a tune, but I didn't know she could sing that well. Everything the 59 year old actress has is in Donna, vocally and physically. Much was made of the impromptu split for the movie's trailers, but Streep's energy throughout the film's big dance numbers makes me envious. If it weren't for all her other star turns, I could say that this is a definitive and star making role. Streep will most likely get another nomination for Mama Mia!; despite all her dramatic and even comedic achievement, this is the complete variety package.<br /><br />Seyfried (Mean Girls, Veronica Mars) is cute as daughter Sophie. She's pretty, but not in a conventional way, and of course, she can sing. I'm glad, however, that the core of the film is on Donna, not necessarily Sophie's oft seen coming of age quest for her father. I'm not a Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) or Stellan Skarsgard (Pirates of the Caribbean) fan, but both fit their parts here with humor and acceptable tunes. Only Pierce Brosnan (Die Another Day) is out of place. Pierce, Pierce-if this were a straight romantic drama or comedy, he would be to die for as the days of Remington Steele. I like Brosnan a lot, which is why I can watch Mama Mia! and forgive the fact that he can't sing. Not like I can sing myself, but it's easy to pick Brosnan for last place among the cast here. Sorry!<br /><br />At the same time, I discovered Abba music I didn't know was Abba and music that I'd never heard before. Mama Mia! gives us the obligatory `Dancing Queen' and the eponymous track-which was stuck in my head for days after. The sound is done well, even if background singers spring up out of nowhere. It's a musical, you can take a leap of faith when people break out in song. Mama Mia! does gives us a few obvious onscreen music set ups, but for the most part the songs are fun and lighthearted. I didn't how they would work one of the few songs I knew in there, but `Fernando' has its moment. `Money, Money, Money' and `Super Trouper' aren't as upbeat, but the low songs are forgivable when considering the desire to fit every Abba song possible in one under two hour movie.<br /><br />While the dated and hokey nature of seventies styles are now accepted and even hip-we wouldn't be having a musical comprised of Abba's songs if they weren't-it is in fact Mama Mia's contemporary stylings that may hinder its long lasting appeal. The shabby chic look of Donna's villa, the dress of the three males leads, and the all too pretty beachy and bohemian look of Sophie and Sky trap this film in 2008. Sure maybe people copied Clueless for back to school 1995, but come 96, not so much. Mama Mia! does win production values for its great Greek locales. The crystal waters, swift boats, impressive rocks and cliffs blend perfectly with the indoor soundstages. I don't want to say `It's all Greek to me', but there were times when this Italian was out of the loop on the Greek marriage customs. I do wonder how the heck everyone climbed all those steps to that church though. Oiy.<br /><br />Although the script from relative newcomer Catherine Johnson is thin in some places and too obvious in others-like the obligatory father bonding montages and near blatant cues for the music-the elder cast keeps things sardonic or witty where it needs to be. Where I'm sure some actors are embarrassed by musical attempts, I don't think the cast here has anything to be ashamed of-even Brosnan! While there is definitely a hard core group of fans racking up the pre sales for this DVD release (it looks like the two disc edition has all the features) it's the music and the talent that makes Mama Mia! a successful transition from stage to screen. Instead of wallowing in Beach Bingo teeny drama, stage director Phyllida Lloyd keeps the mature members of the cast on top. Even though Lloyd lets the pace drag in between musical numbers, its rare to find a musical with adult fun and maturity that's PG-13 enough for the whole family.<br /><br />I don't think guys will care for Mama Mia!. Macho men might cringe at a wife or daughter's obsession with this film. Those Abba songs over and over! Young guys, however, might like the music or the hot dancing. There's nothing super naughty for tweens and younger-what there is might go over their heads, so Mama Mia! might be a parent's chance to swap out High School Musical for something they can enjoy, too.

0307276902|2.0|I can't believe anyone ever believed this story could be true.  The characters are unbelievable, two-dimensional, and unlikeable.  The protagonist is sanctimonious and substance-less, nothing like any real addict I know.  Emotional breakthroughs come as if a switch has been turned, and within minutes and with no real introspection.  And the writing is repetitive, unoriginal, and annoying.  Writing the same sentence over and over and then adding the f-word to the same sentence is something that a 15-year-old might do in a remedial creative writing class.
B00007KQKM|5.0|On The cusp of my Lord of The Rings obsession, I've been passing the time by watching films starring the actors from Peter Jackson's Oscar winning epic trilogy. When my quest for Sean Bean films led me to watch Ronin- in English and Spanish-I broke down and bought the first movie I had seen the Boromir actor in- the 1993 BBC production of Lady Chatterley.<br />Sure Patriot Games and Goldeneye are great, but it was director Ken Russell's adaptation of the banned D.H. Lawrence novels that embedded Sean Bean in my brain. Sex, adultery, class divides, and naughty language sent not one, but three versions of D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover underground. When the third and most tame version was finally published in 1962, scandal and controversy erupted on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />I knew nothing of this history when I first saw the theatrical two hour version late at night on cable. Boy or girl, a young teen will find the soft core porn that is currently everywhere in our society. At the time, I often tuned in for Red Shoe Diaries. A few bumps and grinds, perhaps some [...], sometimes a nice story and historical location. The Marilyn Chambers movies, however, I could do without. I sought more than weak porn. I wanted a story.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when Lady Chatterley appeared. Unlike its early 20th century/World War I contemporaries Avonlea and The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Lady Chatterley stars Joely Richardson as the sexually repressed young wife of a paralyzed veteran (James Wilby) who finds love in a scandalous affair with her husband's gamekeeper (Sean Bean).<br />Make no mistake, there are kinky folks who will tune into the second and third parts of Lady Chatterley's four hours purely for the sex scenes. To take the series only for those visuals, is however an injustice. The miniseries format allows director Russell to take the time and set up the marriage of Lady Constance and Sir Clifford. They are both intellectuals in the upper class. Connie hails from a heady and upstanding artistic family, and Sir Clifford has a long list of noble names to live up to. The couple get on well enough, but there is already strain between them when the story opens. One might wonder how and why they married in the first place. The War? Perhaps the union was an unofficially arranged one? Already we have questions, as does Lady Chatterley. She yearns for more than serving as nurse to her often grumpy (although understandably so) husband. Sir Clifford, however, doesn't want to see his title end, and invites Connie to take a lover, in hopes of claiming an illegitimate child for his own.<br /><br />At first, Constance clings to the image of a loyal wife-despite prodding from her own sister and father. She finds the ranch hand-foreman-wild-man-of-the-woods Mellors rude and fearful. Finally, after discussing the symbolism of the black horse of passion with Sir Clifford, Connie hires a nurse for her husband and sets off to explore her estate-an estate that the brutish and strong-not paralyzed-Mellors is always lurking. Inevitably, the Lady and the Gamekeeper begin a purely sexual affair. Their encounters grow to something more, and the couple seeks to find a escape from the society that divides them.<br /><br />I dare say the serious opening and closing hours of Lady Chatterley are my favorites. The story's setup and resolution are indeed more important than the sex scenes, even though no sexual scene is superfluous or fluff. The reflections on the war, striking coalminers, and class debates all give weight to the story. Sir Clifford reads and becomes extremely intellectual while bound to his wheelchair, yet he sees nothing wrong with the English class divides. Connie of course disagrees with the notion that there will always be people who boss and people to boss. Mellors is a higher servant than most, yet he still must take orders from other household servants, and Sir Clifford mocks his accented speech. Constance's father and sister also find no problem with her taking a lover, but all expect it to be a man of upper standing, not a servant. Likewise, none of the lower class cared that Mellors and his wife lived separately until the affair with Lady Chatterley comes out. He becomes an outcast in his own society-a class that Clifford jokingly calls `the enemy'.<br /><br />The absurdity of this class division is obvious to the viewer. The juxtaposition of the bright, big, and beautiful green Chatterley estate versus the cramped dirty, rocky mines is a smart move by Russell, as is the love scenes between Connie and Mellors. The natural wooded part of the estate is theirs, where class troubles can't reach them, and simplicity and innocence rule-unlike the cold, structured halls of the Wragby estate.<br />Russell and his co screenwriter Michael Haggaig also give double duty to the production's dialogue. I've not read any versions of Lawrence's books, only criticisms, but the screenwriters use the sound source materials to their advantage. Every line spoken has double and symbolic meaning. Part one ends with the first significant interaction between Mellors and Lady Chatterley. She wants a key for the hut on the property, and Mellors closes with, `If you let me know when you want it.' Sexual innuendo, the face value meaning, a little key into the lock penetration symbolism, and a hint of chastity belt referenced all in six words.<br /><br />The acknowledgement of speech divides is also sharp. When Connie's sister Hilda (Hetty Baynes) finally meets Mellors, she asks him to speak `normal English'. The similar but different nature of the way they talk should keep the lovers apart, but it is a treat for the audience. Listen closely, and not just for the naughty language.<br />Now of Nip/Tuck fame, Joely Richardson was fairly new at the time of Lady Chatterley's release, as was future Sharpe star Sean Bean. Both give every ounce to the production, and the delivery from the actors is also perfect. The way Sean Bean says `Your Ladyship' alone shows his pent up torment. We follow Connie's perspective more, but listen closely to Mellors' speeches. He's been a lonely misunderstood soul and now he's found an emotional awakening with the one woman he shouldn't have. Likewise Joely Richardson is perfect in nearly every frame. She's so proper in the beginning, then shrinks in illness. She looks radiant and grows in beauty as her relationship with Mellors grows. The looks and unspoken movements between the two are exceptional. She bites her lips and nails when observing Mellors, and he often tilts his head or hunches away shy in her presence-as opposed to his upright towering over the permanently seated Clifford.<br /><br />The chemistry between the leads is evident, yet Russell swiftly finds ways to symbolically divide them onscreen. Many of the scenes between Richardson and Bean are through fences or gates, implying one or the other is always locked out or in. Even after their relationship begins, trees or posts will cut the two shot down the middle, leaving a divided but symmetrical shot onscreen. Subtle but brilliant from Russell. These shots show how out of her element Constance is, but also how trapped Mellors is. The cinematography, acting, and dialogue all multitask, and multiple viewings of Lady Chatterley is a must if one is to catch everything.<br />Sir Clifford and his nurse Mrs. Bolton also develop a special relationship, parallel to Connie and Mellors, but acceptable of course. Their conversations seem more evenly matched. They play chess and the widowed nurse is more physically intimate with Sir Clifford then Connie, taking over the duties of bathing and shaving him. Her words are also accented, but Clifford never insults her about it. Wilby does a fine job as Clifford. He insults and bosses Mellors, but in fact it is Clifford who cannot function without his servants. Mellors may take orders, but he his own man, where Clifford's paralysis puts him at the mercy of everyone else-even Mellors. Wilby swiftly moves from sorrowful and intelligent to brutish and melancholy. You feel bad for Clifford when his motorized chair gets stuck, and further emotional when it is Mellors who must push the crippled husband of his lover. Sir Clifford of course insults Mellors and then we hate him again.<br /><br />Perfectly matching James Wilby is Shirley Anne Field as Mrs. Bolton. She plays the widowed nurse expertly yet with a slight air of ambiguity. Her button up style and always proper air are perfect, if a little Mrs. Danover from Rebecca. She claims to be there for both the husband and wife but clearly puts together the pieces about Lady Chatterley and Mellors. When rumors begin about their affair, Russell alludes that it might have been Mrs. Bolton leading the servant talk, yet she swiftly covers for Connie and keeps Sir Clifford in the dark. Clueless as he is anyway, Clifford doesn't doubt Mrs. Bolton, nor does Lady Chatterley. It's almost as if she might have let something slip, but not out of malice. Mrs. Bolton seems to understand that Wragby Hall isn't where Connie belongs and seeks to speed her escape to Mellors. The women talk frankly about knowing true love, warmth, and tenderness from a man. Mrs. Bolton knows that is what Connie needs, and she won't get it from Sir Clifford.<br /><br />Social and sexual intrigue aside, Lady Chatterley is a stunning period piece. The Wragby Hall location is breathtaking and takes on the feel of a supporting character itself. When Mellors waits on its vast steps, he's clearly out of his element. Likewise Clifford's room could seem like a dream. Incredible bed, books everywhere, the piano and the latest inventions. Connie, of course, fits neither in the uppity hall or the meager shack in the woods. Joely Richardson's costumes are so lush. Today such hats and flapper style dresses would seem ridiculous, but they looks gorgeous onscreen. The proper style, yet free spirited fabrics and layers fit the character so well, and Russell's attention to detail sets everything off. Richardson's wisps of hair and the clang of her beads set the tone for her wild ways.<br />Sean Bean's costume also says far more about his character than he does. So lowly valued, yet he wears a button collar and tie while he lurks the woods with a dog and a gun strapped to his back. The wearing or removing of his page boy hat also add depth to Mellors' mood and respectfulness. Even the music and props complete every scene. By no means is Lady Chatterley some B porn production. The wind up gramophones, old time radios, candelabras, and vintage cars sell every authenticity, and the score moves between modern jazz tunes and haunting classical arrangements. Russell insisted on using English compositions, and the tunes top off the flavor of the film.<br /><br />But finally I must mention what I'm sure you've all been waiting for. The sex scenes in Lady Chatterley were spared nothing less than Russell's best, of course. There isn't any foreplay, fondling, or even oral sex. When Connie and Mellors finally get to it, they get to it. The initial consummation is a bit awkward for both parties. They discuss and try to resist but ultimately succumb to the sort of re-virginal experience. Lady Chatterley hasn't been with a real man in some time, and Mellors confesses his demeaning wife was the only woman he had ever been with. The dialogue is indeed necessary in the kinky scenes. If what's going on isn't clear in the visuals, the characters say what they mean, and I mean they say it!<br />The pre and post conversations are particularly important in two ambiguous sex scenes-one that is near rape and another that is most likely [...] sex. If you're not reeling and all giggles over those, prepare yourself for Part 3. I suspect Lady Chatterley's `For Mature Audiences Only' warning is for the full frontal nudity sequences. I don't wish to spoil it, but ladies if you go in slow motion, youwill see the whole Bean.<br /><br />In the end, however, Lady Chatterley isn't about the tawdry sex scenes. By part 4, sensitive types may need a box of tissues. The speeches from Connie and Mellors are so sincere, honest, and downright poetic that the audience can't help but root for the couple. Russell hold nothing back, from nasty husbands, kinky sex, and bad language so that we are raw, primed, and moved for the production's big finish. In Lady Chatterley's final fifteen minutes, you will be agonizing and cheering Connie and Mellors on to happiness. Do our fair lovers find each other at the end? I shan't tell!<br />The Lady Chatterley DVD is available in all regional formats at a very affordable price. Usually under $30 at most retailers, or online if you're a bit shy about the purchase. The double disc set has little special features to speak of, only a brief photo gallery, trailers, and an interview with Ken Russell. Not for children of course, I also don't think men will enjoy Lady Chatterley. Despite plenty of Joely's bits, males won't be interested in the story or period costume drama. Keep Lady Chatterley for your own guilty pleasure, or for that all girls night you've been planning. All four hours in one sitting, tears, and repeat viewings- I assure you Lady Chatterley will not disappoint.orrowful and intelligent to brutish and melancholy. You feel bad for Clifford when his motorized chair gets stuck, and further emotional when it is Mellors who must push the crippled husband of his lover. Sir Clifford of course insults Mellors and then we hate him again.    Perfectly matching James Wilby is Shirley Anne Field as Mrs. Bolton. She plays the widowed nurse expertly yet with a slight air of ambiguity. Her button up style and always proper air are perfect, if a little Mrs. Danover from Rebecca. She claims to be there for both the husband and wife but clearly puts together the pieces about Lady Chatterley and Mellors. When rumors begin about their affair, Russell alludes that it might have been Mrs. Bolton leading the servant talk, yet she swiftly covers for Connie and keeps Sir Clifford in the dark. Clueless as he is anyway, Clifford doesn't doubt Mrs. Bolton, nor does Lady Chatterley. It's almost as if she might have let something slip, but not out of malice. Mrs. Bolton seems to understand that Wragby Hall isn't where Connie belongs and seeks to speed her escape to Mellors.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I got this product before they said I would. I listened to it nonstop for the next two weeks. I would definitely recommend this for anyone.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Not Too Late is the third studio album and her 2007 release is a very nice smooth jazz album that blends easy listening, jazz and some pop elements. \\"Thinking about you\\"  and \\"Not to late\\" were both released as singles and are really nice tracks with well written lyrics. The book-let is really nice with Ms Jones looking really nice in a black and white dress in several photographs. The font for the lyrics is ok but a bit tricky to read. 4/5.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|I love the concept behind this package, it really shows just how talented the entire band was. You get to taste the flavor of each member of Kiss in a way we have not gotten to before. Now, for those who are mad that KISS keeps putting out the same songs, they are NOT! It's the record company, KISS has NOTHING to do with any of this...but we fans buy the stuff no matter what and the record company can add to their bottom line via our money. But fret not, KISS is going back into the studio this next year!!!<br /><br />Chris
0141441496|5.0|A 'Novel' Guest Review By Leigh Wood<br /><br />After one too many viewing's of the 1992 BBC production of Lady Chatterley, I finally broke down and read the book. I thought the 1928 unedited version of Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence would be a tough book to find. Expensive, rare, old leather, smelly, buried in an antiquarian store-that type of book. Indeed I was very pleased to find the 1928 Unexpurgated Oriali Edition in paperback at my local Borders. $4.95!<br /><br />I wrapped Mists of Avalon as quickly as possible and avoided watching the film before I plunged into Lover. I read other writers' criticisms on D.H. Lawrence and his works before purchasing the book, and I knew the book and movie didn't have the same ending. Of course, I also knew the book's controversial reputation and supposedly salacious use of naughty words and torrid sex talk. My edition opened with forwards and introductions detailing the book's tough road to publication and the aftermath of censorship. Although this story is fairly well known in literary circles, this introduction is informative, with details and facts on the books printing, pirated editions, and trial information. Even if one was a toe towards prudish, you can't not be interested in reading Lady Chatterley's Lover after these words of praise.<br /><br />Although the 1992 adaptation by Ken Russell is quite faithful, Lawrence's work is naturally bigger and more detailed than what can be translated to the screen. I noticed many cases where the film had taken word for word from the book, and also where scenes had been combined or moved and relocated for the film. Still, much was remaining to surprise me. After her Baronet husband's paralysis during World War I, young Constance Chatterley begins to question her mundane existence as Lady of Wragby Hall and nursemaid to her crippled husband. They are educated and literate, but as she listens to her husband and his friends chit chat about war, sex, society, and money, Connie becomes more and more disenchanted with her upper class standing. After a very dissatisfying affair with playwright Michaelis, Connie begins a saucy love affair with her husband's gamekeeper Olivier Mellors. Despite the fear of being caught and societal pressures upon them, Connie and Mellors continue to meet. When the scandal comes out, they take measures to secure a life together, despite the class divisions against them.<br /><br />The great part of Lady Chatterley's Lover is the love discovered between the titular characters, so I was intrigued by the intitial Michaelis relationship. We learn much about Connie intellectually and sexually through this affair, internal thoughts and disappointing feelings that can't be show onscreen. I've read other fans commentaries online about Joely Richardson's performance as Lady Chatterley in the BBC version. Women sometimes find her portrayal conceded and flaky. Connie has nothing to loose, where Mellors has everything to loose. In the novel, this is certainly not the case. Connie is already nothing, an emotionless drone whose stature gives her nothing.<br /><br />Likewise the Mellors in print has everything to gain. His backstory is greatly detailed by Lawrence, yet he maintains his strong silent and mysterious air. Once on officer during the war and a well educated pupil then tutor, Mellors could have the upper class at his fingertips, yet he chooses to be left alone. This book is not just about sex. Our couple is disenchanted with war, industry, money, and the people around them who think that those things give meaning to life. Some of Mellors' dialogue is written in dialect and for an American like me, it took a double take at first. However, Mellors can also speak perfect English, and does so when he chooses, not when people expect it of him. In fact, his speech is often broken when he thinks it will upset people, such as Connie's image conscious sister Hilda.<br /><br />Lawrence spends a great many of the early chapters discussing artists and their self important selves, yet it is a great and subtle revelation when Connie discovers books in Mellor's house. Its often claimed not to be Lawrence's best work, but Lady Chatterley's Lover intricately weaves the love story between Connie and Mellors with multiple commentaries from Lawrence. Without being too obvious with his author views, Lawrence questions the English post war Jazz society and classes as well as the later artistic society Lawrence often found himself outcast from. This catch-22 is again mirrored in the novel. Where Connie and Mellors affair crosses class divides and angers their entire community, her husband Clifford's unusual relationship with his nurse Mrs. Bolton is entirely acceptable. I love Charles Dickens for his veiled or outright social commentaries, and I dare say Lawrence is on par here in asking those same society questions. Who decides these social barriers and imobilities? Why are some invisible to these restraints via power, position, and money? What is the right reason to circumvent these divides and do something about oneself?<br /><br />Lady Chatterley's Lover has kept me thinking about itself long after I've finished the book. I'd like to read it again and find answers to these questions. Although it is a thorough British book in time and place, Lover also presents very modern thoughts and conjecture. After Lawrence's difficulty with self publishing and piracy, the book was banned until a 1960 obscenity trial. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't find the book all that shocking. Was it because I was familiar with the film version, or is it because the book perhaps caused our current liberal ideas and desensitizing? Four letter words and sex talk have always existed, but Lawrence's honest treatment of the subjects opened a Pandora's box on erotica, pornography, nudity, and bad words in art, literature, and film. I can't say the same for other works, but Lover is actually a very tasteful book, rather innocent in a way. The rebirth of the main characters through their love for one another. Lawrence was tempted to call the story `Tenderness' and the title would have fit.<br /><br />Although the work speaks for itself when it comes to sex, society, and even religion, my edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover came with `A Propos on Lady Chatterley's Lover' by D. H. Lawrence himself. After finishing the book on a positive note, I was disappointed in this thirty page essay. One should always let his work speak for itself, and there's no need for this redundant and overlong speech from Lawrence. From World War I to Christianity, Lawrence's essays should be cut in half or is perhaps better for a college classroom discussion.<br /><br />If you're looking for porn or sexual gratification, you won't find it in Lady Chatterley's Lover. Most certainly the book is not for everyone, and if frank sexual talk and situations is not your cup of tea, do skip this read. I'lm a fairly straight laced individual, and I only second guessed the book once. In Chapter 16 or 19, I thought the anal sex euphuisms were getting a bit redundant. I giggled a few times over the language, but was moved by other beautiful descriptions from Lawrence. At first I looked for Lover in Borders' small erotica section, but Lawrence's works are found in the general fiction section and in the classics section at my local library.<br />Lady Chatterley's Lover is by no means for children or prudes, but it is a fine novel that has transcended time and place. We may be too loose or vulgar in our society today-celebrities with wardrobe malfunctions and half naked women in music videos. Lover and the books in its wake may have caused this openness, but the book also reminds me of the good things about he past.

Powerful realism, admirable stages, engaging tension al the way through, fluid dialogues and fine direction will involve you.<br /><br />Without hesitation, one of the best films of the year.
B000002LOM|4.0|Kill Uncle being Morrissey's 1991 release and his second studio album is very different and unconventional compared to his earlier releases. The lyrics are quite introspective and songs that stand out are \\"Our Frank\\",  \\"Sing your life\\" and  \\"There Is a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends\\". The book-let is quite spars but very nice with a nice clear photo of Morrissey and the lyrics are included with an easy to read font. It even has information of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I heard a piece of this CD on the radio and had to have it. I am certainly not dissappointed with the rest - it is a beautiful, contemplative work.
B000KN7BOA|4.0|Although 1967's Bee Gees First is a fairly recent addition to my collection, anybody who knows anything about sixties music is bound to know at least a few tunes from this one.  Besides having a bit of the heyday camp on the cover and in the music, First is also a bit of a tongue and cheek title to me.  Barry, Robin, and Maurice had been plugging away at music in Australia before releasing this their `first English' record.<br /><br />  Turn of the Century leads off the album in true and quirky fashion.  At first all the talk of bicycles and time machines is a bit hokey, but the tune is so catchy.  Soon enough you'll be singing along.<br /><br />  Mood and melancholy however, make their first appearance on Holiday.  Robin's somber voice takes over and already you realize there is something deeper to this group.  Of course nowadays everyone knows this one from the live versions and Maurice's little side show antics.<br /><br />  Why do I find all these old songs and their lyrics so confusing? Red Chair Fade Away is too similar to other music of the time, which is odd to say on an artist's first album.  Most people do a few covers or use other's songs on a primary release, but Barry, Robin, and Maurice prove here they are more than a passing invasion band. Oh yeah!<br /><br />  Outside of the few monsters on this CD, One Minute Woman might be my favorite.  It is quite underrated in my opinion.  Barry's easy delivery and nearly begging lyrics sold me on the first listen.<br /><br />  In My Own Time is touch and go with me.  I like it, but the tone and vocals are a bit too Beatle imitation for me.  I like my Bee Gees as The Bee Gees.  I've heard fifty other songs that sound like Time.  Are they catchy?  Sure.  Unique? No.  Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You is unique.  The first time I heard this on record I was all over the spectrum.  It's so moody and churchy and chant-like, but the chorus is almost happy.  Every listen gets my wheels churning.  What are they saying? Who cares it sounds cool!<br /><br />  Quirky Craise Finton Kirk Royal Academy of Arts is the first all Robin song presented.  Already on this album we witness the duel leads of Barry and Robin.  Eleven of the songs here are also credited to only Barry and Robin, including all the biggies.  Kirk again has an ambiguous story almost like poetry.  Everyone can read something different, and I love the toy piano like stops and starts. Very nice indeed.<br /><br />  When the boys penned New York Mining Disaster 1941 in a jammed elevator in England, do you think they knew what a classic it would become?  If casual fans tell me they like \\"Have you see my wife Mr. Jones?\\" I always get a great chuckle.  Again people know more Bee Gees songs then they realize-and not from the Brothers `height' in 1977.  This is 10 years prior!  Disaster represents the early genius of the brothers in lyrics, story, mood, music, and hooks.<br /><br />  Besides the fact that the song Cucumber Castle is not on the later album entitled  Cucumber Castle , this oddity gets points again for being like nothing else heard before.  Who else can put medieval  touches into sixties pop?  The one seemingly understandable line \\"Cucumber Castle be ever so humble,\\"  is so contradictory.  A castle? Where kings live? How can that be humble?  It makes you curious for another listen.<br /><br />  If you don't like To Love Somebody, come closer so I can hit you.  This has to be one of the classics. One of the penne ultimate Gibb songs.  None of that Fever stuff.  To Love Somebody says all the love in just the right way.  The proof of musical genius here is evident.  (We also reviewed Somebody, Disaster, and I Can't See Nobody on our Gold  review.)<br /><br />  I like Barry's delivery in I Close My Eyes, but some of the twists are again a bit too Beatle for me.  Actually there isn't much else to say about this song! Pity.  Oh yes I Can't See Nobody!  My niece digs this one.  When I first heard it I thought it was Maurice, but Robin switches styles-showing early on his unique range.  The lyrics here are also telling.  When you are falling in or out of a relationship, the other person is everything, you truly are unaware of everything else.  Robin's creaky ups and downs show the heartache, yet the rhythm of the music describe the heights you can feel. Wow.<br /><br />  Please Read Me sounds a lot like the early Australian tunes the boys did.  The sweet harmony dominating here is the early bloom of what was to come, even if it is a bit short on words.  You can't have it  all on your first album!  The fourteenth and final track Close Another Door starts off slowly.  Robin showcases himself again near the end.  Door  picks up to an easy pace and bookends well with Turn of the Century.  Pity on anyone who listens to the first and last song of an album.  Look at all the good stuff in between!<br /><br />  First is a unique album in every sense of the word.  It's really something special to go back and see classic Gibb music even then, and don't forget several gems here were very ground breaking at the time.  To the fans that have been here since the beginning, I tip my hat to you!itches styles-showing early on his unique range.  The lyrics here are also telling.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|If you're a vintage racing fan, Grand Prix needs no review: it's a remarkable document of the golden age of racing, made at a time when the real cars -- and drivers -- were available. Phil Hill's recent passing reminded us of what we've lost.    If you're a film enthusiast, and maybe not so knowledgeable about 1960s Formula One, Frankenheimer's work still delivers. The cinematography is superb, and the script provides a fascinating look into the social scene and competitive aspects of racing back then. It's educational, without the burden of being a documentary, and apart from the overture and intermission segments it's easy to forget you're watching a 1966 movie. And it has a bit of substance: 1960s racers risked their lives in every race, much more so than F1 drivers do today in their much more elaborate cars. The spectre of death, and the sense that some onlookers might be there for the carnage, weighed on at least some of the drivers who were there for the sport. Grand Prix acknowledges this.    Grand Prix may be the best racing movie ever made. McQueen's LeMans in 1971 (he was originally supposed to be in Grand Prix) is a cult classic for diehard race fans, but almost devoid of plot or dialogue. I'm a big fan but would hesitate to recommend to anyone who isn't a gearhead. Grand Prix, on the other hand, should be very enjoyable to almost anyone with an appreciation of the era.    The extras included in the two-DVD set are also very good, and you can watch them prior to the film if you're among those whose knowledge of Formula One is minimal.
6305127697|5.0|One of the best movies I'v ever seen were the ending just blows you away.They really picked the right stars to play the parts.
0375826726|4.0|The story line is very good, although at times, the author gets tied up in long descriptions of places and things that have little bearing on the story. At over 700 pages the story could have been told well in about 400 to 500 pages. It almost like a student trying to please an overbearing Literature teacher by using as many words as possible thinking longer is better. Other than that I liked the story and the line it is following. I just don't need continuos descriptions of Saphira's shiny scales. At times it becomes monotonous.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I always end up on the backend of a phenomenon-not really getting into something until everyone else has. Recently I've gotten involved with The Lord of The Rings fandom. Neh-I am certifiably obsessed! At least I am not obsessed alone. You know we are obsessed with The Lord of The Rings when my future husband found out my ring size by trying his replica One Ring on my finger. (A replica I bought him.) How did this craziness come about? Repeated viewings of The Two Towers Extended Edition that's how.<br /><br />I didn't see The Two Towers in the theater. I didn't see it when they came out on DVD. I watched the culminating third Return of the King movie before the middle Two Towers film. Only when both my father and future husband insisted I watch The Two Towers did I succumb. I liked it well enough, as I did the Fellowship of the Ring and more so Return of the King. My Tolkien obsession, however, did not really begin until we bought director Peter Jackson's Extended Trilogy.<br /><br />Fellowship's extended scenes were exceptional enough. Tidbit book info here and there and additional character development. Nothing in the extended films is excessive, redundant, or unnecessary fluff. Jackson cut the film's only for length, I'm sure-the extended version of The Two Towers clocks in at over three hours. The extended footage of Eowyn, Faramir, and Boromir ice the extended version.<br /><br />Although it is much more subtle in the books, Jackson's cut footage of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) develops the crush subplot into a full-blown love triangle. In the extra scenes, you get the feeling that Aragorn does generally like Eowyn, and were it not for Arwen, or the Ring, or his destiny, he could settle in Rohan. We of course know different, and the bittersweet feel of the scenes is just the right flavor.<br /><br />The real treat of the extended Two Towers is a lengthy flashback sequence involving Boromir (Sean Bean) before he journeys to the Council of Elrond. Denethor, Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father, wants The Ring for himself. Favorite son Boromir protests, but abides his father's wishes. Despite a loving relationship between Boromir and Faramir, Denethor nearly loathes his second son. Now that Boromir's dead, Faramir wishes to take Frodo and The Ring simply to prove his worth to his father. Although they differ significantly from the book, these insights into the Steward family are exceptionally done. Skillfully acted and directed looks and glances do in 10 minutes what takes the book 10 pages.<br /><br />These scenes and two key scenes added to Return of the King involving the relationship between Eowyn and Faramir impressed, shocked, and intrigued me so much, I started reading The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson's vision presented in the extended Two Towers is truly worthy if he can get me to read the books. I never felt I had the time to invest in the epic.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is a great movie to watch durning the holidays with the family. Leaves ya with a warm fuzzy feeling!!

B001DCQJ4A|4.0|This is an exciting CD, even for a major non-fan of Gardiner's. It opens with a strikingly dramatic funeral march for chorus, winds, and timpani -- Begrabnigesang, Op. 13 -- that was the first effort of a brilliant 25-year-old to set chorus and orchestra together. I had never heard of it, much less listened to it, but Brahms has discovered the same stern, uplifting Protestant tone that would characterize the German Requiem. Gardiner's exemplary Monteverdi Choir is asked to sing in period style without vibrato, which is irritating, but it suits the work's quasi-archaic monody.<br /><br />This is followed by a spectacularly vivid account of Mendelssohn's 'Mitten wir in Leben sind,' here expressed with theatrical excitement rather than chruchy reverence. It was written a capaella and gives the Monterverdi choristers a chance to display their perfect intonation and disciplined ensemble. Completing the generous choral portion of the CD is a more familiar Brahms piece, \\"Schicksalslied\\" (Song of Destiny) Op. 54, a mature work that rarely makes an impression on me. But here, even though indulging in every quirk of period style, Gardiner manages to inject more vitality than I would have expected -- the faux Baroque manner relieves the music of dated Victorian piety.<br /><br />Which leaves the main work, the First Sym. The four symphonies have received barely any period-style readings on CD, although there have been some small-scale ones (notably from Charles Mackerras and Daniel Harding) that employ orchestras the size of those in the smaller capitals of Europe in Brahms's day. Here Gardiner loses me -- the blunt, thwacking timpani, skimpy, zingy string sound, and blaring brass set my teeth on edge. The pacing seems rushed and brusque. Gardiner's fans love his music-making for exactly these qualities, however. I can't fault the Revolutionaire et Romantique forces for their ability, so we are spared painfully out-of-tune strings.<br /><br />Would Brahms recognize any of this as authentic?  Plenty of conductors and musicians who played in Brahms's lifetime or who forge a link to the Romantic era went on to make early recordings, none of them remotely in the style esposued by Gardiner.  Being full-blown Romantics, like the composer himself, they played in romantic style. Oh well, the choral works are so exciting that they are worth the price of admission on their own. Now the  HIPsters can grumble.as authentic?

B000001FE0|4.0|I've waited far too long in tackling Odessa! A very ambitious review I'm sure.  The over the top, red felt and gold impressed 1968 double LP says it all about this album-Barry, Robin, and Maurice's ambitions, talents, and conflicts all rolled into one.  Fans in the know recall that this album is what briefly split the group in the late sixties and early seventies.  The concept that was too big for the Brothers Gibb.  Dang.<br /><br />  The album is supposed to tell the story of a man shipwrecked, and each song is to represent him telling his tales of life and loves lost. Odessa with it's parenthesis (City on the Black Sea) opens the concept smoothly.  At over seven minutes in length, the title song sets the mood for the wavy waters we are about to traverse.  My mom hates this song's repetitions and ups and downs and seemingly stupid lyrics.  It took awhile for it to grow on me, but the twists and turns make sense if the music is to tell the destruction of the HMS Veronica.  Robins croaky delivery of the title makes me want to turn blue.  Where does he get that much air?<br /><br />  You'll Never See My Face Again is much shorter than Odessa, and Barry's delivery is smooth.  Already we're seeing the multiple personality of this album.  Odessa is quintessential orchestral pop, and You'll Never See My Face Again is a touch of sardonic country.  Can we boil it down directly to Barry versus Robin? Maybe.<br /><br />  Robin returns for Black Diamond, and he is much more listener friendly this time around.  The poetic lyrics make more sense than Odessa, and Diamond is just the right length.  The ending turns into a bit of  Auld Lang Syne.  I'm not sure why the boys chose to do so, but it's unexpected and well done.<br /><br />  If you want truly sardonic country than Marley Purt Drive is for you.  The story in this one has all the honest details, and Barry's voice fits the ho-hum routine.  The kicker at the end is a real topper.  You can't help but sing along and smile during Marley Purt Drive.  I must not spoil it!  Must not!<br /><br />  At first I thought Edison was kind of stupid and would skip over it.  Do I really want to hear an ode to Thomas Edison? No.  Even with the content snafu, Edison has its moments in Barry and Robin's lead.  They break up the monotony and keep the bland subject fresh.  The placement of Edison might also hurt it.  It's got tough competition before and after.<br /><br />  Melody Fair is incredible.  The strings and echoes and story all combine superbly for a tear jerking dang good song.  Who is Melody?  Is she the lost sailor`s woman?  Or was she a missed chanced never to be realized? It`s sad either way, and all this is reflected in a different way each turn around.  Brilliant. (We've also reviewed Melody Fair on Best of Volume 2.)<br /><br />  I actually have several sound bites from Odessa on my computer and Suddenly is one of them.  Somewhere here in the middle the concept gets wishy washy and we're left with a song for each brother.  Suddenly is Maurice's trippy track.  Once again he seems short on actual lyrics, but what little is said is brass, if you catch my drift.  My mom didn't mind me singing it in public until I got to the `How can you tell humans are real?' line.  Just the noises Mo makes in this one are worth the listen, especially his Oh yeah!<br /><br />  Whisper Whisper  starts off slow and quickly picks up into a swinging sixties tune.  It reminds me of Hullabaloo, although I don't know why.  My sister caught part of Whisper in my car one day, and said ,\\"Ew, Kristin.  What a horrible song!\\"  Whisper's orchestral music mixed with British pop is sharp to me.  The drums and sound effects are tops.  Whisper Whisper also has some raunchy lyrics.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll! I suppose it takes a special ear to enjoy Odessa all together.  ;0)<br /><br />  My Mom hates Lamplight.  Robin's creaky voice can take some getting used to, but my mom says its nails on a chalkboard!  The story lyrics are great, and the tone perfectly captures those old fashioned thoughts of quills and inkwells.  The chorus is strong, and the three part harmony carries to the end.  All the Robin songs here seem to carry the shipwreck concept.  His woe is me voice is just meant for such melancholy drabble.  I'm not so sure Barry is even on this track.  The echoes might just be over dubs.  The closing echoes might drag on too long as well, but they sound pretty.<br /><br />  Barry definitely makes his presence known for Sound of Love.  The soul ballad is the first of two Baz slow songs presented.  The words tug at your heartstrings, and Barry's voice matches perfectly with the ups and downs in the music.  A very under appreciated song.<br /><br />  Currently my computer opens with Give Your Best.  The snappy dialogue and banter show the fun side of the boys, although I wonder how forced the track was, considering they hated each other at the time.  The ironic lyrics are very sing along, even for those of us who don't like country.  I have no clue how this song would fit in with the lost concept!<br /><br />  The Seven Seas Symphony is an instrumental that captures everything Barry, Robin, and Maurice wanted to say in its 4 minutes of non lyrics.  The opening is soft and beautiful.  The oooos and aaaahhhhs in the middle help accentuate the up and down composition and that shipwrecked feeling.  I am really hung up on the shipwreck!  I love playing Odessa's instrumentals for my classical music friends.  They are wowed and ask who it is, and I am more than happy to share this underutilized facet of the Brothers Gibb.<br /><br />  With All Nations (and I can't forget the parenthesis International Anthem!) continues the more orchestral and less pop begun in the Seven Seas Symphony.  Not as ominous, Nations seems happy to start, but its booming ending is a real kicker.  The vocals are the same as Symphony, and I'm not sure why these two are listed as separate rather than one big song, since Nations is only 1:42.  I often confuse which instrumental is titled what.  They all sound like they belong together and in my playlists that is how I play them.  The boys could have had a whole `nother career composing ballets.  Who knew?<br /><br />  I Laugh In Your Face opens with some sort of circus talk.  I'm not really sure how this is supposed to tie into the lost concept, but this tune always reminds me of the old fashioned turn of the century circus posters with Death!Defying!Stunts!  Another strong chorus with harmony and top notch music.  What is the rest of the song talking about? Does it really matter?  It's amazing how I think I can absolutely hate a song, and then the boys bring in one single hook that can make me listen to a whole crappy song.  Thankfully, Face isn't crappy.<br /><br />  Never Say Never Again is a cute song.  The rhyme is stretched by the way the boys say again-stretched to rhyme with Spain!  The story isn't really anything new.  We've heard love lost melodrama before, but the chorus here is so easy and fun to sing.  I'll even let the double negative slide.<br /><br />  And now I come to First of May, the song that broke the Brothers Gibb, albeit briefly.  Barry's second slow tune was chosen as the single over Robin's Lamplight, and the wounded younger Gibb went solo.  I like the opening lines about Christmas trees being tall and kids being small.  It reminded me of being a very young child, when the Christmas tree really did seem so huge.  Barry's easy tale is soft and moving, yet has some pretty senseless lyrics.  Careful, it can bring a tear to one's eye.  Is First of May better than Lamplight? I'll leave that one up to you!<br /><br />  The British Opera is the closing instrumental and matches the concept and over the top bravado begun in the opening track.  The tune is a tight orchestral opus that ends the album with power and impact.  I wish With All Nations would have  been the closer with its booming ending, but I digress.<br /><br />  It is debatable whether Odessa failed in its concept or not.  Enough of the story was put into place, and just enough lies undone for the listener to fill in the blanks.  Odessa is more of a treat for its look into Barry, Robin, and Maurice both working separately and together.  Maybe they did try at a linear album and failed, but the talent of The Brothers is obviously not linear.  Odessa displays the multifaceted trio perfectly.

B001EOQWEO|4.0|Wall-E is one of my favorite PIXAR movies pretty much all of them are my favorite, but there's something about this one I like more anyways the special edition DVD is nice great movie for adults and kids and the special features are really nice, but be ready you'll need to buy a dvd case to hold the three discs the reason is it's packaged differently from most dvds your used to luckily my discs is fine, but I put them in a spare dvd case just to be safe I've heard reports that people have been finding their discs are scratched when they took them out of the packaging that's why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars sorry, but for a 3 disc set type thing I was expecting a nicer package I like my dvds to be scratch free or minamly scratch free..    Besides the packaging flaw it's a great dvd for all the extras you get, but for a animation masterpiece like this I'm going to get the blu-ray version since it has a few BD extras that the DVD doesn't have and give the dvd to a friend as a gift this'll be my first blu-ray disc and I don't even have a player hopefully by this summer for next holidays I'll have me a PS3 and a decent TV.

B000089RVX|5.0|I'd pretty much given up on metal by the late 90's.  I heard a song one day that was playing in the background of a television show.  It had a solid groove, good rhythm guitar work, and a striking high soprano voice.  The voice had a haunting quality that was both ethereal and intense.    After the show was over, the song was stuck in my head.  I had no idea who it was.  Then, one day, a couple of years later, the song resurfaced in my mind from nowhere.  I just HAD to find out who it was.  I didn't have much luck with internet searches of female metal singers.  But I was finally able to remember the opening lyrics \\"How can you see into my eyes like open doors\\" or something to that effect.  Another internet search on the lyrics, and voila! I had discovered the band Evanescence.    I bought the Fallen CD right here on Amazon, and have been enjoying it thoroughly.  Her vocal style reminds me a bit of Tori Amos and Allison Krauss, but with a darkly intense twist.  The guitars are big and punchy and the drums an interesting mix of metal and another style that I suppose is influenced by Hip Hop and/or Techno.  The songs are well-written and instantly catchy.    My favorite songs from this CD so far are:    1) Bring Me to Life (the song that I heard on the TV show)  2) Going Under (very catchy and powerful)  3) Tourniquet (incredibly powerful and moving)  4) Imaginary (epic!)  5) Haunted (interesting use of dissonant harmony in a metal song)      I would strongly recommend that anyone who likes Metal give this album a chance.  I've never owned an album with a female vocalist (at least not from the rock or metal genres), nor am I big fan of \\"gothic\\" rock (which is a label I've seen others apply to this disc, though I'm not sure why... perhaps because of the piano and choir).  I usually listen to older metal bands like Metallica, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.  But again, I'd say you should give this album a chance.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.  It's quite good!
B000YAA68C|2.0|I really need to stop watching romantic comedies at 3 a.m. My last gander was the 2007 chick flick P.S. I Love You, starring Oscar winner Hillary Swank and 300 hunk Gerard Butler. Why do I bother?<br /><br />Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) live in a small New York apartment and argue like normal couples, but they truly have a great life and love at heart. When Gerry dies from a brain tumor, Holly struggles with his death despite help from her family and friends. Shortly thereafter, on her 30th birthday, Holly begins to receive predated letters from Gerry. These treasures help her remember the good times, make new experiences, and find herself again.<br /><br />She has had many an out there role, from The Next Karate Kid to Boys Don't Cry, but I wonder what it was that drew Hillary Swank to this role. Holly is by no means a pretty part. For some reason the character dresses like an idiot, and there's a lot of crying and why questions ala Nancy Kerrigan and the whole knee bashing thing. I can see the emotion in the grief and overcoming the death of a loved one, but for personal reasons alone, not from Swank's trying. I don't know what I'd do without my husband. Do I care if Holly gets over Gerry? Not really. She's given plenty of opportunity to do so, and after chance after chance, not only did I not care, but I wanted to smack Holly to her senses. Why Hillary, why?<br /><br />P.S. I Love You was hyped largely as the next big thing after Gerard Butler's success in 300. I understand his not wanting to be typecast, and his work prior to 300 was quite diverse, from Dracula 2000 to The Phantom of the Opera. I just find this film of all the choices, to be so...weird. Some girls may be charmed by all the romance and such, yadda yadda, but otherwise, this is a very unflattering role. His singing is wrong here, and there isn't an Irish actor out there to fill our Irish onscreen Gerry's shoes? Not only is the whole `dead Gerry' and Gerry Butler vibe a little creepy, but he disappears halfway through the film-before the last letter arrives. I don't get it. Butler has one scene before the opening credits, then spends the rest of the film in flashbacks or as figments of Holly's imagination. It's as if the performance technically doesn't exist. Star Trek fans complain if an entire episode is a dream or a big reset button. It's not as if the ghost of Holly's dead husband is really haunting her, that would be worthwhile I think, ala The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. It would have to be funny, not serious, Ghost cornered that. I just don't see the appeal of a film that turned out to be a complete misstep for both leads. Why Gerry why?<br /><br />Not only have the two leads been unfortunately miscast, but the absolutely stunning supporting cast of P.S. I Love You has been completely wasted. Oscar winner Kathy Bates (Misery) receives her token obligatory weepy scenes as Holly's mom Patricia, and Gina Gershon (Bound) and James Marsters (Spike, People! Spike!) disappear from the film with no explanation whatsoever. We get a tacked on reunion with Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and a cop out at Yankee Stadium with Harry Connick, Jr.(Copycat). I found myself more interested in these fine supporting players and their complex relationships, but their trials and troubles are dropped in favor of Holly's obvious and typical story. The eclectic mix has the comedic and dramatic-and heck musical-talent needed, but it's never used by writer Steven Rogers (Hope Floats) and director Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King, Freedom Writers, and The Bridges of Madison County).<br /><br />It's not woeful leads and misused support, however, that undoes P.S. I Love You- it's the whole dang story from author Cecelia Ahem. Maybe the movie took its liberties from the source novel, but I'm certainly not rushing down the street to Borders to get the book, that's for damn sure. The bemoaning of Holly just goes on and on. As I said, grief is something everyone can relate to, but enough with the letters already. They are too obvious and convenient. The first message is on a tape recorder. Why aren't all the others? In this day and age, Gerry couldn't videotape himself and email it to Holly everyday? How is she really expected to get over her dead husband if new information and good memories of him are technically coming from him after death?<br /><br />Gerry and Holly are so poor, but he can plan elaborate bar trips and vacays to Ireland? And all this while dying of a brain tumor over the course of one year? The soul searching of what grief can do to one person is undone by the unrealistic nature of the story's plan. Never mind the horrid soundtrack and all that omigod chick stuff about turning thirty, marriage, divorce, babies, and looks. And after all this, how does Holly get on with her life? By designing shoes! Could you alienate the male audience more? I can't believe guys wrote and directed this.<br /><br />Fans of the cast will tune in for P.S. I Love You, but I don't think it will be a Gerry dream for the ladies or a tour de force for Swank fans. The DVD supposedly has more scenes and interviews with Ahern-something I would normally find interesting, but I don't think its worth the full price of the disc. Unless you are a big chick flick fan, please avoid. Fans of the individual cast are better off finding clips on youtube.us and convenient. The first message is on a tape recorder.

1883217040|4.0|A good book, I now understand the relationships between scales, chords and modes. The only problem fot me is: I'm a guitarist, and the examples are written in double staff notation (for pianists), So when the author says 'try this on the piano' I get a little stuck. It would have been better for my purposes to have a more especialized book, with especific guitar chord voicings.
B001EN71DG|2.0|This is just another chance for the studio to cash in on the Original Trilogy. The only reason the set receives two stars is for the quality of the films. It is pointless to buy this unless you don't have other versions of the movies.    Just an attempt at extra cash with the release of the prequel trilogy.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|While The Dark Knight is being regarded by some as the best movie ever done (mostly by teenagers) I have to say, while not the best film, it sure does fare well against others.    The Blu-ray version of The Dark Knight is much better than it's regular counterpart. The picture is very better with the colors more vibrant and the sound and music much clearer. With a special feature more (I believe it's The Psychology Of Batman) the special features are about the same as the Two-Disc. Special features are presented in 1080p for the most part.    The movie is good and the Blu-ray version of the movie is excellent. A must by for Batman fans and people who love crime dramas.

This book in particular is great because it is interactive.  My son is having a lot of fun filling in the pages with his own creative writings, sharing it with his friends, etc.

B001H5X7KC|3.0|While Tropic Thunder serves as another Ben Stiller comedy, the film has its moments. This version of the movie is about the same as the theatrical cut except with a few more scenes.  As with all Blu-ray films the movie does look better with explosions looking more real and so forth, but you might as well buy the movie on the regular version or, if you want, the Director's cut, but not on Blu-ray because it's not much different.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|For the mature, this is a delightfully delicious romp into the realm of fetish!  Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader are wonderfully teamed as two unusual people evolving into their greater selves.      While there were moments I reached for the remote...thinking I might wish to speed through what appeared to be too unseemly a reality, I never really had to press the button.  The movie stayed \\"tastefully\\" this side of cruel, while educating the viewer of the \\"lesser\\" needs of the desperate.      For all the unsavory subject matter, that I can dare to say that this is actually a \\"feel good\\" movie is the greatest compliment to everyone involved in the making of the film.  In less gifted hands, it could have easily gone over the line into repulsion.  But, everyone involved was/is a true artist in their own right, and we, the viewing public, are given the benefit of those skills.  For those wanting to expand their own borders, this is a fine movie to watch along the way.  You'll be glad you did! I highly recommend this film for the \\"mature\\" and the \\"evolving\\" soul.

The appears to be the solitary way that he's capable of writing to evoke emotion. It's sad really. He used to be a great writer and now this...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is what you saw on Fox and some that were not aired. This was a very good show. Outer space meets western . It was a real shame that Fox didn't give this show more of a chance.
B000000W5P|5.0|I have been a Rolling Stones mega fan for as long as I can remember. The first single I bought upon it's release was 'Honky Tonk Women' and I played it until the grooves were worn thin! I was hooked from that day forward.<br /><br />That being said, I was extremely disappointed when 'Some Girls' came out. I guess I had been a bit disappointed with the last few outings upon first listen. The Stones have a knack for making albums that can be an acquired taste.<br /><br />Now I look back and I think most of their efforts are better now than when I first heard them. Following 'Exile On Main St.' the band's crown jewel, 'Goat's Head Soup' and 'It's Only Rock & Roll' have grown on me tremendously. Black and Blue does have it's shinning moments, but it's the beginning of the end of the great period.<br /><br />'Some Girls' is the first album featuring The Stones new sound! As much as I hated 'Hot Stuff' the first time I listened to it, I really loathed 'Miss You'! While the Stones lyrics remain strong the music IMHO, started to lack that special flair. Don't get me wrong, I was pleased that The Stones had a huge selling album with 'Some Girls', but it's not the classic Stones sound here.<br /><br />This is one of my least listened to Stones albums. I can't knock a high rating because it's still the Stones and if you compare it to some later releases, it remains a semi- classic! I can understand the group of people who first got into the Stones with this album loving it, but for older fans, I think it's just OK with some great tracks. Since this album, I have only heard a handful of songs that resemble the old Stones two being 'Mixed Emotions' and 'Slipping Away', both from 'Steel Wheels'. There are a few more, but those two remind me of the raw \\"Exile\\" days.<br /><br />Congratulations to the Stones for a successful album, but I'm stuck on the golden years of the Stones!
0060578793|5.0|This book was excellent at highlighting the need for good preparation and being forearmed with knowledge. Its a great collection of knowledge and experience that applies across most situations and locations.     The format makes for easy reading and reference and the diagrams are easy to follow. It covers all the essentials of navigation, food and water (even sources of salt), game trapping and hunting (inclusive of simple weapons). The author's approach of stressing the importance of good preparation and the manitainance of a \\"will to live\\" set the perfect tone for getting into the basics of survival.    Overall, a great buy. Scope for improvement: Make this into a smaller, hardcover or leatherbound, waterproof edition that will easily fit into any camper's bag or outdoor excursion package for quick and easy reference.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|The Dark Knight is a great movie and would have been even better if they cut the entire Two Face storyline out. I like Two Face, but his story dragged the movie out a little too long for the last thirty minutes. The movie also suffers from a low replay value. I loved it in theaters and only liked it when I watched the DVD.<br /><br />Heath Ledger, without question, is the best part of the movie. He makes this movie as the insane Joker. When you see Batman fighting the Joker in the interrogation room, it's epic! It is like watching something as big as David versus Goliath! Every scene with the Joker is great, especially when he is with Batman. What I didn't care for was Maggie Gyllenhaal. She is a great actress, but looks way older than Bale out of place. Overall, a really good movie
0385751893|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was great because the perspective that this story is told from is not your average perspective. I also loved how the author made you aware of certain things without showing them. It was great!
0316017922|5.0|I enjoyed and appreciated this volume just as much as I did Blink and The Tipping Point.  This is a \\"must read\\" for any bright manager.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This is a very funny movie that should tickle the funny-bone of fans of any war films, and any other comedy fans.  Ben Stiller proves himself as being a better director than his previous attempt with Zoolander and Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies of 2008.<br /><br />We have a solid primary cast between Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr., but good old Robert Downey Jr. manages to steal most of the scenes from his co-stars as the white actor playing the black platoon sergeant (\\"I don't drop character until the DVD commentary\\").<br /><br />There are plenty of star cameos, but the best (and most unexpected) comes from Tom Cruise, who plays a foul-mouthed, fat corporate executive.  His cameo was originally intended to be kept a secret, but it was impossible to keep this appearance from leaking to the internet.  Let me tell you, this man may want to move into comedy considering his current negative status among the public.  He was SOLID in this movie.  I would have never expected Tom Cruise to pull a role like this, but he did and he actually was incredibly funny in most of his scenes.  The audience at my theater applauded when the credits showed his name.<br /><br />Both Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise are qualified for the Golden Globe nominations!  Only reason I think Cruise wouldn't have a good chance over Downey Jr. is because of his little screen time, as opposed to Robert Downey Jr., who's present throughout most of the film. (Both were nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Comedy/Musical)<br /><br />Other notable appearances are by Nick Nolte, as a Vietnam Veteran, and Matthew McConaughey as the Ben Stiller character's agent.  Tobey Maguire also makes a humorous appearance at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Overall I was tickled, and surprised by this very well-balanced cast of notable actors.  Every actor in here gets off some good jokes, and in different styles of comedy.  This film had lots of different types of jokes, ranging from parody, satire, drug addiction, slapstick, and just plain silly antics. This film had everyone in my audience laughing at one point or the other, through its many references.<br /><br />I felt this redeemed a long string of horrifically bad American made parodies.  I never liked the work of Matt Stone and Parker with their shows such as `South Park', and don't even get me started on this `Disaster Movie' nonsense.  Only notable films I could spot were made by the Brits, with such brilliance as Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz.  Tropic Thunder isn't as good as those two films, mind you, but it certainly beats out all recent American made parodies.  I never felt offended, or attacked by this film.  It set out to entertain, and it entertained me from start to finish.<br /><br />Tropic Thunder is great fun!d just plain silly antics.

0897500482|5.0|This book is amazing.  It is filled with the subtle ideas that Bruce Lee created on his own, about an art that he created on his own.  Whether you know martial arts or not this book this book needs to be read.  It might inspire you to join martial arts, or just simply enjoy the insiteful thoughts of a legend.  If you are looking to use this book as a tool to learn martial arts or teach yourself, you might find it difficult.  Obviously Bruce Less studied for many years in the art of gung fo before writing this book.  If you have never taken martial arts before you might not understand some of the things that are talked about.  I myself have never taken martial arts, and there are somethings I do not understand, but overall I feel more enriched after reading.  Take the time for this one, it will not dissappoint.

B001AD3NIM|5.0|Thats all I can say. Oh My Gosh. Ok so I must admit JLP is and will always be One of my top 5 albums of all time. I love Alanis. I was thrown off by the pop/electronica beats everyone was talking about. Well I bought the album anyway just to complete my Alanis collection. there are a few popish songs on the albulm but they are still great. The album in itsself is AWESOME!!!!!! This is right up there with JLP. I love every song on this album. ITs really only the two or 3 songs that are (clubish) if you will. The whole album takes me on a ride of every emotion possible. When it plays through I cant wait to play it again and look foward to wearing it out. :) If you have any doubt...dont. You will NOT regret the buy. Support this album. It is her top album along side JLP. BUY IT NOW, DONT WAIT. :)

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I finally took advantage of getting what I pay for with my cable company. Prior to Season 3 of Dexter, I watched the first two seasons on DVD ([[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Season One]] & [[ASIN:B000V86OKG Season Two]]). I used to send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and Dexter was never part of my regular TV viewing until 2008. Color me stupid. What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.<br /><br />How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the first two seasons in weeks versus like 3 months PER regular season on Showtime. We often watched three episodes in one night on the DVD sets. Alas, I couldn't wait for Season 3's release on DVD, so it was one episode of Dexter, one week at a time for Season 3.<br /><br />So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.<br /><br />Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO's [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]] fame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.<br /><br />The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this \\"stuff\\" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />The major plot involving guest star Jimmy Smits in Season 3 is a bit more of a stretch of reality than were Season's 1 & 2. But the acting, dialogue and well-written story flow kept the show right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.<br /><br />Add this bloody-good show to your cart. I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from Season 1. I dare you to just try watching Season 1 and then not go for Seasons 2 and 3; I simply don't believe that anyone could possibly do that.right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|\\"Gutsy and epic, but grounded in the personal, the songs are tailor-made for those magical moments when music, whether it be uplifting or heart-breaking, can transport you to another place, which is exactly what Cook intended.\\"    Every song on this CD is excellent!
B0017WCG48|3.0|I bought this album with great expectations. Hearing what Analog Productions and Music Matters have done with 50 year old master tapes on their spate of blue note 45 RPM reissues, I thought this set was a cinch for best reproduction quality in my collection. Unfortunately, this reissue falls flat. The acoustic bits at the beginning of \\"Battery\\" are downright holographic and lifelike. This teaser of what could be is short-lived. Once the boys rip into the meat of the track (and into the rest of the album), I feel like it is 1992 and I'm listening to the cassette version of this in the tape deck of my 1978 Volare. Everything sounds compressed, flat and lacking in dynamics. The drums don't pop and the bass doesn't slam. In fact, these rhythmic and punctuative instruments are scarcely audible over the guitars and vocal.  Well, perhaps that is a bit of hyperbole. Maybe this is an artifact of my decidedly mid-fi system, which is reasonably well suited to jazz listening (Vpi scout w/ Denon DL-103 cart; MC stepup is achieved with a pair of UTC a-11 trafos feeding a creek OBH-8 for RIAA correction). This purchase was meant for me to see what my system could do with a rock album. I have never heard Metallica sound so anemic. Honestly, 50 year old acoustic jazz recordings (e.g., Art Blakey on Music Matters' A Night in Tunisia or Analog Productions' Moanin') sizzle, pop and slam more than 20 year old Metallica. If you want Metallica on vinyl, I'd save my cash and buy the Mofi 33rpm pressing or maybe a preowned copy from your local used record dealer. I haven't heard either, but they can't be worse and you'll spend less.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I really like this movie, so did my granddaughter; so, I purchased the DVD for her.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|Well album titles should have a purpose and this one definately does.  Evolver which means moving forward in change.  This does not mean that the classic sound and vibe is not present but just in a different light.  With songs like Take Me Away, Satisfaction, and Cross The Line there is a popular music element but still in the same classic soulful Legend sound. Everybody Knows is more like his previous classic releases lyrically and of so true.  No Other Love/W Estelle is especially groovy with a raggae tinge.  Andre 2000 w Green Light, the uptempo, first single release leads you into a string of hits. Brandy teams up with the Legend on Quickly and does not disappoint. Kanye with \\"It's Over\\" collaborate on this project adding more depth and dimension.      Good Morning is of so extra-special with it's best intentions , much like I Love You, Love.  \\"This Time\\" is so big and beautiful, Legend is singing his haart out and hittin notes all over the place. They both speak volumes to and from the heart.    \\"If your Out There\\", Legend's speaks to the world, promoting peace, love, unity and togetherness; which is consistent with the types of songs he writes. I definately hope that this song will be a part of the inauguration because it is the song/sound of these times.    I am truly wondering what those who stated or implied \\"Legend on decline\\" are listening too.  I feel like you never understood the artist's work in the first place. This project is Legend at his best and culminates his style impeccably . I truly hope he does not read those reviews and take any stock.  Listen to the lyrics and the sound;  you will discover John's Legendary sound. This is an Evolutionary Classic, Don't Be Dismayed.  This is definately a collector's item.

B0019T9FL6|3.0|well I really expected more from this CD in regard to collabo's.  The T-Pain is nice, the Luda is cute; pocketbook. But I wished there was a collabo with Dwele, Donnell Jones, Lloyd or even one of our more seasoned ballader's like Maxwell,Joe, Avant, Brian McKnight, etc. With Clive Davis, as executive producer, there should not have been a budget crisis  Her Dreamgirl's fame should have warranted big production credits to make the album a spotlight release.  There was enough publicity to make this a number one release.  Don't get me wrong I love Fantasia, but that the boy is mine, has been done, remember Brandy & Monica, then Whitney & Deborah Cox. Besides the arrangement didn't highlight any new technique.  You would think these CEO's could be a little more imaginative.  The song Spotlight is really the hightlight of the CD.      I think Jennifer deserves better, shame on you Clive.
B00003CXCQ|1.0|This DVD purchase was a disappointment since the DVD would not play.  My son informed me and I informed the sender.  A second DVD would not play either and the store offered a refund.  Lesson learned:  DON'T BUY DVDS FROM AMAZON.COM.

How do reality shows grind on and on whilst this gem was shoved to the back of the closet?  It just proves that FOX can't see a diamond for the sand.  Buy it, you'll love it.
0689835604|5.0|Where Is Baby's Belly Button? is one of my daughter's favorites. At first, I read it to her and lifted the flaps, but now she lifts the flaps as I read it to her. Many times I've had to read this book three times in a row!    The flaps on this book are more durable than some. They've become bent from much use but are still hanging on. Baby has ripped off lesser flaps.     After reading this book to my baby for months, I recently caught my 10 month old flipping through the pages on her own saying \\"baby\\" as she lifted the flaps. I read one of the pages to her  as she sat there and she immediately climbed into my lap to have the book finished.

0920236162|5.0|I am so glad that I found this book! How refreshing to find a tale that I can read to my daughter where a) the main character is a girl, b) she is strong and courageous, c) she doesn't need the man! While being inundated with \\"the magic of Disney\\" and the weak, pathetic, princess brigade, I realized that I didn't want my daughter exposed to any of that crap. Sure, as my mom has pointed out, I read those stories, but really how many stories about weak, ineffective, victims does it take to drill home the point that women are supposed to be pretty, submissive, and ineffective? I love the end of The Paper Bag Princess! Ronald was a jerk!

B001EOQWF8|3.0|Wall-E in blu-ray is outstanding in animation visuals and has a cute story line obviously with very little words used since they are robots. Adults who love animation will have fun watching this movie but it won't knock your socks off like Finding Nemo, Toy Story or Cars.  Little ones from say 5 to 10 years old will love this light hearted soft toned movie more then older kids and that is what I believe it is soft toned.  Some will find it boring and lacks depth in the characters. Frankly as good as this movie is they could have had more fun making Wall-E a little more interesting in his personalty he reminded me of Charlie Brown sorta bland but hey how much personality can you give a robot, lol.  And as for the complaint about the way to many fat people on the ship doing nothing not seeing the world around them, maybe it hit way to close to home for some, lol. Nothing wrong with reality story line in animation take a look around, that future for humans is closer then you think, lol.  All in all a good movie I would give 4 stars for animation but only 3 stars cause the plot dragged to much in the first quarter of the movie and I can't give it even close to 5 stars like I said in the first part it's a cute movie not a absolute must see movie.
1933492279|4.0|Im not sure this is the kind of review amazon is expecting me to write. But here goes anyway. The \\"Cosmic motors\\" is a fantastic piece of work made under enviable circumstances. It is a dream for any designer to be assigned a no bar holds (and all paid for) sketch frenzy for years. The result is a inspirational guide and eye opener in one neat package. We have had this book at the office for a while now, and all the designers (my self included) have sifted through it on a daily basis. Leaving the book rather worn and torn Im afraid. It was about time to order some new copies.   So here is the real issue...    Id like to say this whithout pointing finger at anyone.  I am fully aware of it being a long chain of delivery,   from me ordering a product to recieving the badly damaged package.  Still...   It is rather disapointing. I ordered not one but two \\"cosmic motors\\" to replace the worn out copy we have here at the office. Sadly the wrapping was so damaged that both of our new copies were in worse shape that the one we already had.   Sure, I didnt put up the extra $$$ to get the ultra speed delivery option in velvet wrapping. But I DID pay around $100 for these books, so...  I guess what Im trying to say is that   You should recieve what you pay for, yes?   Not 346 torn wrinkeled and moist damaged pages with the back bindings broken.   I ordered books, not junk.

159448385X|5.0|When I first read the description of this book, I admit I didn't think it sounded very interesting.  When I finally decided to read it, however, I was delightfully surprised by the engaging and well-written storyline.  This book traces about thirty years of history in Afghanistan, first through the eyes of Mariam, a girl wed to a man thirty years her senior.  Mariam was born a harami, a bastard daughter born out of wedlock to a household servant and hidden away to conceal the father's shame.  When her mother dies, Mariam's father, to escape the wrath of his wives (he has three) forces her to marry a shoemaker named Rasheed and move to a different city.  Mariam, who was born to a poor life to begin with, can only watch as her life deteriorates further when she is unable to produce any children for her husband.  Ten years later, we pick up the story again through the eyes of Laila, a young girl born to a neighbor of Mariam's.  The ongoing wars kill Laila's parents when she is just fourteen, and she is taken in by Rasheed, who is struck by her beauty and has plans of taking her as a second wife.  When Laila discovers that she's pregnant by a childhood sweetheart who has also been killed by the war, she assents to be Rasheed's wife, not knowing what she is getting herself into.<br /><br />This book continues through the eyes of Mariam and Laila, as they form an unlikely friendship and care for each other and eventually Laila's children and try to protect each other from their abusive husband.  The situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate for women, and watching as life gets harder and harder for these spirited two was deeply moving to me.  The language is rich, the characters fleshed-out, the dialogue realistic, and the story heartbreaking and uplifting all at once.  I love a book that draws me in so deeply that I have to actively clear it from my head in between reading sessions, and this one had just that effect on me.  Reading this book had me smelling the spices they cooked with, feeling the burden of wearing a burqa, and hearing the constant explosions of a seemingly never-ending war.  The ending was ultimately bittersweet for me.  This book will make you think deeply about the cultural differences that still exist in the world to this day; it certainly gave me a better understanding of Afghanistan, and that's something I feel a lot of people could benefit from.ey cooked with, feeling the burden of wearing a burqa, and hearing the constant explosions of a seemingly never-ending war.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|I LOVE animation and, at the same time, tend to be hyper-critical of half-hearted efforts. It's not enough to have cool animation you got to kick it up a bit. I'm looking for a DVD that has it all: great story, killer animation, great casting, and features that are worth watching. Kung Fu Panda delivers on all fronts. The story works for kids and adults with plenty of lessons for every age, they truly break animation ground with this production, and the features are just as entertaining as the movie and you'll watch them more than once. Now, casting - Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogan, and David Cross. Sometimes that much casting power is lost on a lesser story, but WOW is the only word that repeatedly comes to mind. Jack Black is hysterically funny and incredibly vulnerable and heart-warming at the same time. This is a must have for any animation collection.
140120841X|5.0|Here am I again, confronted with classic, one of those comics that changed the way people looked at the media. On of those works that showed that comics and heroes aren't about flashy superpowers or great feats of strength, evil enemies and demonic characters with want for total destruction. This one showed that comic book can be intelligent, thought-provoking and in a way brave - in not choosing the easy way out. Its macabre atmosphere, which corresponds to bleak atmosphere of great towns and political systems of today, it's dark brilliance, brisk of Shakespearean tragedy, mask that never stops smiling and never shows it' face, birth and life of an subversive idea, romanticism embodied in a product of concentrational camps. Where Adorno saw nothing but bleak existence, destruction of all hope for humane project, Moore saw the birthplace of  new kind of warrior, one which bathed in blood of fellow humans, one utterly insane but whose insanity feels as a better programme when compared to government one, one which embodies anarchy,  revolution, and changes to come - all in one body.<br /><br /> There is no need for fresh, new and inspiring look to this classic, it aged wonderfully, showing just now its full potential. What maybe seemed overrated back then in the eighties, now shows itself as a reality, somewhat harsh, but metaphorically correct. What many of the \\"more literate\\" books failed to see, Moore and Lloyd showed in a disturbing way, forcing their reader to think once again about the world in which he lives in.<br /><br /> This is the book for everyone. It's not avant garde in a way the one would need vast amount of experience before reading it, it can be understood and enjoyed by total beginner, and it can be understood in all of it's complexity. That doesn't mean that Moore's symbols are banal or impregnated with pathetic high-talk. It means that \\"V for Vendetta\\" in it's simplicity becomes complex, its usage of shadows, perspective, movement, color - all blend into one fine piece of art that speaks of human struggle, human monstrosities, ordinary lives which shatters when confronted to aggressive ideology. It speaks of war, want for war, and want for peace eternal. Its political leftism may be appalling to some,  which will consider way of V as being too radical and violent, it may disturb rational pragmatist who will in V's romanticism observe nothing but childish ideas which cannot, and should not be achieved. But mere existence of these interpretations, mere possibility to look upon this book as something more than colorful piece of action figures, shows how great this book is. Quarter of the century later, drawing inspiration from this one, many artist presented many great work to readers of the world, but few managed to score high as V did. If you didn't yet read this, you can be sure that you're omitting great work, kind of works that shows once in a decade or more.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Oh, what an excellent little film. We are led through scenes of hauntingly beautiful period vignettes.  The eerieness of the illusionist's performances, and the back story of suspense and romance.  We are kept spellbound until the final illusion.  Edward Norton is mysterious and hypnotizing as the illusionist, Eisenhiem.  The political climate of Vienna and the eccentricities of Crown Prince Leopold rachet up the intrigue.  This is another artist's movie.  If you are an artist you will not be disappointed.  If you are not, you probably won't be either.  Which hand will you seek to look under?

I was kept enthralled and in a dreamlike state while viewing the tableau of retro-futuristic eye candy.  Paltrow and Jolie are stunningly beautiful, as always, and Jude Law is handsome, daring and fearless in thwarting the diabolical designs of the villian and his killing machines.  I fell victim to an addictive contagion of wanting more, more, more of these stunning escapades and special effects.  So very Flash Gordon-y.  You must see!

B000QUCNP4|5.0|As a person who was mesmerized by Robert Greysmith's book, I did not think any movie production based on the same events could compare.  I was wrong.  This is a wonderful movie, if you like true crime productions, and mind boggling even if you don't.  As a young Army wife who took a two week TDY to SF, I found myself staying in an el cheapo motel right next to The Presidio where Zodiac, who was still active, had done some of his most heineous handiwork.  I was frightened and always looking over my shoulder.  As a true crime buff, I had stayed aprised of his activities. I have even visited the Zodiac website many times since, where you can hear a recording of a Zodiac suspect's actual voice.  Chilling.  Who was the Zodiac?  Their best canditate has been cleared by DNA lab results of sealing one of the envelopes with his own saliva.  He was a clever guy, however and possibly tricked another person into sealing it for him before he put the address to the SF Police dept on it.  Police science will most probably give us the answer some day.  Jake Gyllenhaal as Greysmith is superb, as are the scenes that try to help us get inside the mind of the killer and the man obsessed with catching him.

0393327345|5.0|Fight club is contemporary social criticism blended with dark humor and poignant insight. The nameless faceless narrator is unsatisfied in his seemingly perfect white collar job that would gain \\"alumni notes\\" approval. Unfortunately, he harbors resentment against the repressed desires in a stifling society and he seek sanctuary in support groups for the mortally infirmed. He develops a relationship with Tyler Durden. As a respectable member of society, the narrator cannot fulfill his repressed evil desires. Thus, he joins forces with Tyler to develop a way to separate and free his evil urges. Together, they invent the \\"fight club\\" that evolves into more anti-social gangs that further promote chaos and violence.<br /><br />Without giving away the surprise ending or too many plot lines, Fight Club is an examination of the duality of human nature. Similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, characters are portrayed as tamed and civilized by the laws of society but having an inner propensity for evil and mayhem. Violence is not merely a sin to be avoided, but a path to enlightenment. Life and death are intricately interwoven as living to avoid death is death. The organizations created by Tyler are reminiscent of the totalitarian regime of Big Brother in 1984. No one shares information (the first two rules of fight club are not to talk about fight club) and Tyler is ominous but never present. Mayhem assignments are assigned anonymously and carried out without question and without collaboration with other members. Tyler's directives reduces his being to its most basic form, in which evil runs freely without considering the constraints of society and civilization.<br /><br />The book reads fast as lightening. Highly recommend, but not for the faint of heart. Story is heavily spiced with acts of violence and mayhem committed against innocent and not-so-innocent victims. Modern classic more comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Frankenstein than Vonnegut.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|There are several sequences in Let the Right One In that would have been better left on the editing room floor. You'll know them when you see them. They did little more than take the audience out of the moment and distract from the real brilliance of the film. Had they been left out, I would have easily given the film five stars. I wanted to explain that up front, because, apart from this quibble, Let the Right One In is a truly wonderful film.<br /><br />The film is a touching portrayal of love -- it's ability to overcome, to embrace privately what makes us original, freakish, terrible, and wonderful, and the lengths to which we will go in its name.  With a slow, steady hand, and with a wonderful gift for flashing glimpses and suggestions, the director, Tomas Alfredson, convinces us that this weird, otherworldly, and bloodthirsty place is simply another facet of the human experience.<br /><br />Some moments stand out -- when the \\"father,\\" having returned home unsuccessful, asks for forgiveness, and his \\"child\\" lashes out in this ancient voice; when Eli, the forever-twelve-year-old vampire, gently caresses Oskar after she reveals, and he accepts, that she is \\"not a girl\\"; and when Oskar leaves this father's house after the arrival of a \\"friend,\\" with intimations about why his mother and father are no longer together. This is truly subtle and intelligent filmmaking. It also speaks to the loneliness of modern youth. For vastly different reasons, Oskar and Eli have no meaningful relationships with adults. In their loneliness, they find each other.<br /><br />In thinking about this movie, one theme that seems especially provocative is the idea of this ancient, yet physically undeveloped vampire being drawn to the young, innocent Oskar. Like the rare young woman who is wise and world-weary beyond her years, Eli gravitates to the youthful innocence of Oskar. It perhaps fills this long forgotten need to be a child -- something that may be inherent in her stunted physical development. But, at the same time, she becomes a mother to him, a guide, and, some might say, a corrupting influence. For Eli, Oskar represents, perhaps, a last, tenuous hold on her own humanity. Throughout the film, she battles the need to draw him in with the fear that, in doing so, she will destroy the very innocence that drew her to him.<br /><br />Be patient with Let the Right One In if you think it begins too slowly. The pace is essential to its ultimate effect. This is one of the best films of the year, and one truly to savor in its graceful unfolding.same time, she becomes a mother to him, a guide, and, some might say, a corrupting influence.

B000M14YWC|5.0|This review is about the Heritage Press edition of Frankenstein, illustrated by Everett Henry.<br /><br />The first version of this book with the Henry illustrations was published in 1934, in a run of 1500 copies. Now rather pricey, it was and remains one of the Limited Editions Club's most desirable books.<br /><br />At some point, but at least by 1962, Heritage press decided to repackage the book. It is lavender. A pretty, pastel lavender on linen-finished cloth interwoven with white. Decorative pigment leaf elements designed by Henry appear on the cover and spine in an odd, saturated violet (including a creepy hand, and a building.)<br /><br />Responding to color is a personal thing. At first, I found it bizarre that this great gothic tale would be lavender. Now I wouldn't want it any other way.<br /><br />In a midnight blue, lightly-textured slipcase. 257 pp with over 5 full page color illustrations, illustrations at the chapter headings, and black and white incidental illustrations scattered through the text.<br /><br />Introduction by Edmund Pearson.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|A return to the Saturday matinee thrills of yesteryear, with Harrison Ford in terrific form and some memorable set-pieces courtesy of director Steven Spielberg. Despite a slow midsection, &#34;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&#34; (2008) is a more satisfying adventure than &#34;Temple of Doom.&#34; Ford manages to hold the film together, but why do producers shove nonentities such as Shia LaBeouf down our throats? Luckily, there is Cate Blanchett's villainy, Ray Winstone's comic relief and Karen Allen's spirited reappearance as Marion Ravenswood. The formula still works and a fourth sequel would be welcome — minus LaBeouf.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan wipes the slate clean in regard to comic-book adaptations. One of this decade's essential films, \\"The Dark Knight\\" expands upon the Batman mythology by emerging as a character-driven, psychological crime drama. Nolan's Gotham City represents a bleak world view with little hope - a mirror image of Bush's America. The late Heath Ledger delivers an astonishingly detailed performance as the Joker (his talents will be sadly missed), yet the entire cast is excellent. Special kudos to Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon and Aaron Eckhart's doomed Harvey Dent. \\"The Dark Knight\\" surpasses all expectations with its seamless fusion of visual bravura and incisive storytelling. A big-screen event all too rare in today's cinema.

Even the minor characters are memorable, for instance, Justin Long as the obessed fanboy.  This is a perfect blend of parody and homage, & of comedy and action.

B0017IYWEE|3.0|I can see that I am going to be out on a limb compared with previous reviewers - but I notice that an Amazon.fr reviewer thinks similarly to me, so here goes anyway:<br /><br />I was looking forward to reviewing this disc, having been impressed by Diana Damrau when I heard her live as Zerbinetta and, like everyone else, wowed by her Queen of the Night on DVD and \\"YouTube\\", where her rendition of that fiendish aria has had hundreds of thousands of hits. She has since declared that she will no longer be performing that rôle, but, judging by this collection of arias, I wonder if that decision is premature.<br /><br />Undeniably, Damrau is hugely talented: lapidary precision in coloratura, no hint of shrillness in her top notes, absolute security of intonation, an assured stage presence and considerable personal charms - she has many sterling qualities which combine to make her a gifted singer of the modern type that productions worldwide cry out for. She is, nonetheless, still a relatively young and inexperienced singer and I wonder if she has not allowed herself to be pushed too soon into assuming the grander kind of Mozartian rôles to which her voice is not (yet?) ideally suited. I need to be specific if I am to make my case, and I am aware that some will think that I am being unnecessarily harsh, but while listening to the majority of the arias she undertakes here, I inevitably found myself comparing her with earlier, favourite artists, as I felt that there was something wanting.<br /><br />Let's start with Pamina's aria from \\"Die Zauberfl&ouml;te\\". I reached for three other versions for the purposes of comparison: one by Gundula Janowitz (a hissy, venerable 1964 recording with Klemperer conducting), one by Barbara Bonney (her 1992 recording on a recital disc), and a third by Barbara Hendricks (the complete 1991 set conducted by Mackerras). These performances vary hugely in speed, ranging from a pacy 2'28\\" with Mackerras to a leisurely 4'09\\" with Klemperer. Bonney comes in at 3'26, so Damrau's 3'59\\" is also quite relaxed, yet compared with the Klemperer/Janowitz version it seems to drag and plod; there is little feel for rubato or flexibility of phrasing in Rhorer's conducting. By comparison, Mackerras (Hendricks) and &Ouml;stman (Bonney) ought to sound as if they are galloping through the aria, but, on the contrary, they simply sound natural and unforced; their singers are able to phrase sensitively and project a real personality. Janowitz' Pamina, in any case, is sung with such heavenly phrasing and tone that we do not notice how long Klemperer takes over it. Nor is it a question of period style versus modern instruments; &Ouml;stman directs a period band whereas Klemperer has the LPO and both are equally successful in their way. I find myself subconsciously disconcerted by Rhorer's use of \\"correct\\" original lower pitch for all the arias in this recording; once you have heard Janowitz float her B flat, Damrau's equivalent note, pitched somewhere around a quarter tone lower, sounds distinctly flat, being closer to a modern A - but that might not necessarily bother others. Finally, it is a question of quality of voice. All of the other ladies I use for the purposes of comparison, have, to my ears, a greater intrinsic beauty of sound, more individuality of utterance, more variety in tone, dynamics and vocal colouring. Each seems to do a better job bringing Pamina alive and gives her what the late \\"Gramophone\\" critic Alan Blyth used to call more \\"face\\".<br /><br />It follows naturally that if Damrau is somewhat outshone by her predecessors as Pamina, then it is still less likely that she will be a satisfactory Countess, Donna Anna, Donna Elvira or Vitellia- and so it proves. She simply hasn't the breadth and heft of voice to sing these deceptively demanding rôles. She can sing all the notes but essentially trills her way through them as if she hasn't really digested the music. Most of the time, whatever she is singing, she sounds like a Susanna - which, along with her Constanze, the arias from the early operas and the two concert arias, form by far the most successful portion of this recital. Damrau is essentially still a light lyric soprano with a voice too small of scale to rival, say, Renee Fleming, Martina Arroyo or Eleanor Steber in the \\"grande dame\\" rôles in Mozart opera. I took down Dame Janet Baker's assumption of Vitellia to reassure myself that I was not being unfair to Damrau - and there I found the attack, the variety of colour, plaintiveness of phrasing, richness of lower register and, above all, the ability to use coloratura to enhance emotion - all of which are lacking, or present to a lesser degree, in Damrau's singing of \\"Non piu di fiori\\". She certainly makes it sound easy, but she rarely moves us. Her Donna Anna is young and vulnerable but ultimately forgettable; even when she is singing Susanna, her characterisation pales in comparison with a singer such as Lucia Popp. In truth, I was bored by much of this recital, despite her accomplishment.<br /><br />Le Cercle de l'Harmonie is certainly a talented band; they play with verve, accuracy and technical brilliance but Rohrer seems to favour extremes: they are sometimes driven too hard and at others seem too relaxed.<br /><br />I am reminded of an anecdote from Beverley Sills' autobiography in which that celebrated singer remarked that she did not think Norma was that difficult a role and that some lines in \\"Norma\\" always made her \\"want to giggle\\". This, her stern detractors remarked, explains her lack of proper commitment and gravitas as Norma. I do not say that Damrau is guilty of such flippancy, but I wonder whether she has not fallen into the trap of severely under-estimating the challenge of the grander arias she has undertaken here. She is a major talent but this CD represents, for me, a bridge too far, too soon.Constanze, the arias from the early operas and the two concert arias, form by far the most successful portion of this recital.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I have never seen a more accurate description--or portrayal--of the Joker as I have with the late Heath Ledger.  He described the Joker perfectly, as a \\"mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy.\\"  He really brought that Joker to the screen, someone who was charismatic and chaotic at the same time.  Christian Bale as the title role was an excellent choice, as well.  I am saddened that Heath isn't around to reprise the role, but he's made his mark on film forever.
B0002KQNL8|2.0|I remember seeing this movie at the theater when it was first released. But I kept getting it confused with the first one, and after watching this film the other night, I see why. This is basically a remake of \\"Return of the Living Dead\\", just in a different setting, and with a hair metal soundtrack as opposed to the punk tunes featured in the first film.<br /><br />The basic story is that the army loses a cannister of toxic gas which happens to bring the dead back to life. Thanks to some young kids who open the cannister, the dead soon begin climbing from their graves, echoing their previous cry of \\"BRaaaiinnnnssss\\"!<br /><br />To be honest, this entry just doesn't hold up well. Sure, the special effects still look good, but the comedy just falls flat. James Karen simply running around whining for 80 minutes of the film gets old fairly quick, especially when you are watching this film right after watching the first one! That's almost 3 hours of Karen running around doing his screaming/whining/crying schtick!!<br /><br />The only real reason to check out this flick are the special effects. It's nice to revisit the 80's horror flicks that featured genuine special effects and not just CGI generated junk. There are a few moments where you will truly ask youself \\"how did they do that??\\". Unfortunately, if the special effects won't hold your attention, then pass this one by, as both the story and action have been done before and in better fashion.
B0009UC810|4.0|I remember when I was a kid visiting Universal Studios with my family and we always stopping in the street to listen to the Blues Brothers.  There was a huge crowd of people gathered around to `boogie' as it were; shaking their money-makers for two middle-aged men in black suits.<br /><br />It was awesome.<br /><br />I was very young at the time, pre-teen, and so the idea of watching the movie from which all this fun came from was not within my reach.  My parents were very strict when it came to entertainment, and an R-rated film was definitely out of the question.  Well, I'm older now, married and out of the house and I can watch what I want to, so when I saw that `The Blues Brothers' was coming on Encore I DVR'd it, all those childhood memories rushing back to me like a warm blanket on a wintry night (and beings that it is literally freezing outside I think that analogy works quite well).<br /><br />So, the question remains; was the movie as good as those childhood memories?<br /><br />Almost, but not quite.  The movie is truly a classic in the sense that it was one of a kind at the time and is definitely still unlike any other film to be released since.  It's fun and exciting and funny at times, although some if it didn't seem to flow as nicely as I would have wanted it to.  It seems weakly plotted to me, and I wanted something a little more intelligent; but that's just me.<br /><br />I still really liked it.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Jake and Elwood Blues, two men who grew up brothers in an orphanage.  They weren't `blood brothers' but they were united by their love of music.  The film opens with Jake being released from prison.  He moves in with Elwood and the two quickly learn that the orphanage in which they were raised is going to be torn down unless they can raise a significant amount of money; so they decide to round up their old blues band and make it happen.  When they get the police force on their tail for wrecking havoc as it were, these brothers find they have a hurdle standing in the way of their `mission from God'.<br /><br />The performances are all strong, especially from Belushi and Aykroyd.  They deliver their extended SNL-skit personas wittily and effectively.  They are supported by a slew of musical guests from Ray Charles to Aretha Franklin, all of which big a smile to the face of the audience members.  Also look out for a funny turn from Carrie Fisher who plays a homicidal ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />Like I said, the film is fun (adult fun thanks to some harsh language) and maybe that is a little bit of my disappointment with the film.  I know that I'm gonna get some `unhelpful' votes for this one, and probably a few \\"it's an R-rated movie, what do you expect?\\" type comments, but anyone who knows me and has read my reviews knows that I never gripe about a films mature content.  All I'm saying is that this subject (the subject of `The Blues Brothers') brings back some very wholesome and just wonderful memories for me that the film in a small way was able to diminish.  The language was unnecessary, but whatever.  It's still a fun movie, a classic at that, and I won't hesitate to watch it again.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just looking for something to complain about.e way of their `mission from God'.

B0015XHQTE|4.0|Long before Clint Eastwood was considered a \\"serious\\" actor, he was known to us B-movie lovers as the star of such fantastic fare \\"Any Which Way You Can\\", \\"The Gauntlet\\", \\"Firefox\\" and of course \\"Dirty Harry\\". Here is Harry at his dirtiest. You get all five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films in this collection as well as some nifty extras (that 90% of us don't really care about). The films look great and you owe it to yourself to own this collection of films that helped launch Clint into superstardom.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Harry\\" - The original flick is still fantastic as Harry must track down a sniper. This film set the blueprint for all cop movies that follow. What is now considered cliche was launched in this film. The renegade cop out for justice, the well meaning but doomed partner, and the nifty one liners that Clint always has on hand.<br /><br />\\"Magnum Force\\" - A decent sequel has Harry tracking down a murderer who is targeting local bad guys, dishing out some vigilante justice of their own. Hal Holbrook plays Harry's stressed Captain in this entry and is fantastic. A great solid story carries this one along very well.<br /><br />\\"The Enforcer\\" - This may be my favorite entry in the series. It features Tyne Daly as Harry's newest partner, and the chemistry between Eastwood and Daly could be considered the prototype of all those cop-buddy movies that soon followed. Add in a group of bad guys that take over Alcatraz Island, and you have a real winner.<br /><br />\\"Sudden Impact\\" - Sondra Locke finally wormed her way into the Dirty Harry series, and she actually does a good job. Once again someone is taking the law into their own hands, and Harry is on the case. This may feature the greatest one liner in the series with \\"Make my day!\\", and the supporting cast does a great job. I liked that Harry was more or less on his own in this entry, and the vigilante's backstory does a great job of having you torn between who will win, Harry and the killer.<br /><br />\\"The Dead Pool\\" - Here is the reason for only a 4 star rating. While the idea of someone targeting local San Fran celebrities is a nifty idea, and while this film does feature an soon-to-be A-list cast of Patricia Clarkson, Liam Neeson & Jim Carrey, it's the weakest entry in the series. Harry becomes the target of a lunatic who uses among other tools of mayhem, a remote control car. Yep, if you have ever wanted to see the most lame car chase in movie history, look no further. Watching Clint try to outrun a Radio Shack hotrod is amazing stupid. It ruin the entire film.<br /><br />But please don't let \\"The Dead Pool\\" dissuade you from picking up this fantastic series. Clint is at his growling best in these films, and they are so much fun, you would be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring the series.While the idea of someone targeting local San Fran celebrities is a nifty idea, and while this film does feature an soon-to-be A-list cast of Patricia Clarkson, Liam Neeson & Jim Carrey, it's the weakest entry in the series.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|What a great movie! I saw it multiple times in the theatre and it still never gets boring. Unfortunately, my DVD copy was bad and crashed on multiple DVD players during the scene where Eve and Wall-e travel up the garbage chute to the captain's deck, but, the movie is just excellent. Are we evolving into  a race of blobs that cannot think past our immediate needs? You are what you do, when it counts.<br />The extra scenes place a twist on the story that would have weakened the impact. Dynamic, explosive, a must see. If you see one movie this year... I laughed I cried...etc. get the idea?
6305907145|2.0|This movie is a Hollywood version of parts of the book.  I am not interested in the movie as the intent does not match Jane Austen's book.  If an option of -10 was available I would gladly give that rating to this movie.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Once again we are not disappointed by David Cook's work! This is an excellent CD..With a wide variety of songs.
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|Everything about this is good.  We have lost touch with the traditional ways of our country and culture - this brings it all back - what a terrific story.
1401216676|5.0|ha cumplido las expectativas que tenía, y tras leer varias obras de moore, decir que esta breve, dura, y magnífica historia es la que está mejor ilustrada de todas, sin duda. una pieza para colección.
B001F290E4|5.0|this reminded me of the music from my teens. Very sexy smokie jazzie tunes. you will love this for a romantic evening.
031606792X|1.0|I would never let a teen of mine read this book. The idea of a human and a vampire having sex is disturbing enough. For her to become pregnant jumped the shark. How does sperm stay viable in a decades dead vampire? Never mind the creepy mental images of, well, you can imagine... The pregnancy descriptions were revolting. But worse the descriptions of Bella's bones and spine being broken from within by her monster baby gave me nightmares.<br /><br />The appeal of the series was the interplay of human and vampire. I'd hoped Meyer would keep Bella human, would give her a reason not to denounce life.  But oh no, we get vampire Bella. Are we supposed to be happy for her? And mama vampire Bella with the monster baby that, once it is done killing her, everybody loves. Isn't it cute how it drinks human blood from a cup? Yikes!<br /><br />Jacob's voice as narrator was awful. The story wandered into crazy territory. When Jacob imprints on the monster baby, there was nothing credible left of the first three books.<br /><br />And of course, Bella is the most powerful vampire of all, even at six months old.<br /><br />I finished the book but I'm advising friends to stop after book 3. There is nothing in \\"Breaking Dawn\\" that merits the time it takes to plough through such a long and unsatisfying book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I got this DVD I thought the first level was going to be a piece of cake, but to my surprise I did even had to take breaks in between and I was sweeting a lot and had to drink lots of water as well; even though I considered my self as an advance intermediate exerciser. This DVD is though, but the exercises are really good and if you keep up you will see results as I did specially in my shoulders they look great!!!!!   This is one of the best DVD's you can find out there  Dare to take the challenge:)
0385340540|4.0|I don't read a lot of Grisham, but I bought the un-Grisham-like [[ASIN:0440244714 Playing for Pizza]] earlier this year and was smitten by it.  [NOTE:  I listened to the audio version, astonishingly well-narrated by Christopher Evan Welch.]  Grisham's in-depth knowledge of all things Italian intrigued me.  I was curious to discover how he came about writing about semi-pro American football in Italy.  The story related by the author is that he stumbled upon this subculture while in Italy researching material for 'The Broker.'  Needless to say, I felt like I owed to myself to read this one, too.<br /><br />Grisham's storytelling capabilities are in full flair here.  I blasted through wide swathes of the book, completely engrossed in the tale.  With 50 pages left to go, Grisham set the stage for a stunning denouement featuring the CIA, FBI and at least three foreign security agencies chasing our roguish but likable protagonist, Joel Backman.  However, the last 50 pages don't live up to that build-up.  I felt the ending was comparatively weak and rushed.  He lets the worm off the hook a bit.
0156421178|5.0|This is a must-read for persons interested in the Spanish Civil War, and it's a side of Orwell that seems to be rarely discussed. Amazingly, Orwell even manages some humor in the midst of this terrible conflict (unlike Hemingway) as Orwell paints the picture of the 1930s Spain that was about to go from a horrific conflict into a horrific dictatorship that is still the dominant topic in Spain more than 30 years after Franco's death (e.g., the formation of the Basque separatist group ETA was greatly helped by hatred for Franco and his desire to crush all non-Castilian culture in Spain).
