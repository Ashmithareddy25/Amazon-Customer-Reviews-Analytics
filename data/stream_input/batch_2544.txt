B001MTENOC|5.0|A wonderful book and awesome research. The book gave me lots of answers but also left me with lots of questions about my own journey. I look forward to experiencing this for myself and potentially being a subject.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This was purchased to accompany the Fire HD 7&#34; model. It suits the purpose of protecting the kindle device perfectly.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|That doesn't take too much of my time.  I can spend 10 minutes to feed my dragons, maybe buy a new habitat and start a new egg.  My grandchildren like to use my Kindle and move my dragons around.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put book down! Recommend all 3 books..must read! You can really feel the words that the book has.. keeps you on your toes!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first started playing granny run but my nephew wanted this game so I got it for him and then I finally tried subway surfers and this is the only game I now play on my tablet.
B008D36INE|2.0|I wanted to like this film but it was hard to follow the timeline and direction was over dramatized. I just couldn't finish it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game and very addictive! Lots of prizes to win. Reminds me of the arcade games. Enjoy!
0793516471|5.0|Clapton's Albert King tribute album is full of perfectly trancribed solos. No bass lines, but there is a Jack Bruce book.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|Some good jams, but there are a couple that sound a little too &#34;poppy&#34; and too much auto tuner. The hidden gems are worth it though.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|It's enjoyable. You'll like it, if you liked season one. If you didn't, you probably won't. Great guest stars.  Still, it's not Brisco County Jr.
0375869026|5.0|We did the audible for this book on a family road trip... it is so well done and has life lessons for the whole family.  I highly recommend this for children and adults alike!
B0012DW6W4|5.0|I love everything about this period drama: the actors, the clothes, the sets. Everything is spot on. I never get tired of watching it.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|I wanted to add my .02 about this vinyl box set...<br /><br />I heard about all of the problems with these, and avoided buying this because of them.  I ended up finding a good deal at amazon.ca, and decided to risk it. My turntable is a 1975 Thorens TD-145 that I bought for $70, and I have a grado red cartridge that I upgraded from a green.  Not crazy audiophile stuff at all!<br /><br />I put the lps from my box set on, and each one sounding fantastic!  I did notice that the music runs almost all the way to the label, and these records were cut very loud (the volume of the music on the lp).  This is probably the loudest cut album I own out of 1,500 or so records!  To be clear I am not talking about volume wars loudness, this recording is not brickwalled.<br /><br />Anyways, when a record is playing and gets closer to the label, something called \\"Inner groove distortion\\" can happen.  IGD is minimized by proper alignment, but it is basically caused by the needle not hitting the groove in the same spot as the album plays, since the needle is attached to an arm off to the side the relationship with it and the record is constantly shifting.  This may not cause a problem for 90% of records, due to how the grooves were cut, but when the engineers decided to cut this album with lots of bass, and as loud as it is, they inevitably made a record that requires a correctly set up turntable.  If you have never set up your turntable, it is most likely not set precisely enough.<br /><br />I use an alignment gauge I printed out for free by googling \\"cartridge alignment gauge\\", a small scale that can be set at the same height as a record would be to measure how much pressure the needle is pushing down (I bought a digital one for $10), and a blank record to set anti skate (A counterforce to keep the arm from going in to the center too fast or flying off the record the other way).  It is easy to learn how to set up a turntable at a decent level.<br /><br />As for this box set, All thealbums are flat, the vinyl has minimum surface noise.  As stated earlier, this is cut LOUD, but with dynamics.  I have really enjoyed revisiting this once favorite album from my angsty teen years, and I am enjoying the songs I liked the most then less, and the quieter ones I didn't like as much then are sounding really great now.  I can already tell this box is going to become one of my \\"show off how good vinyl can sound\\" albums.  If you have decent equipment (not crosley!), I recommend picking this up!
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Hearing classic CCR mingled with new Fogerty is a dream come true but add in the mega star power found on this album and you have a sound that is out of this world!! I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Fogerty, CCR, or any of the many stars that duet with John on this stupendous album!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The culmination of one of the greatest epics written does not let you down. Everything you have been waiting for and much much more.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I watched this again after not having seen it for many years.  Loved it all over again!  As always, Stewart is warm and appealing and backed by an outstanding comic cast.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like zombies, end of the world as we know it shows you will love this one. Great characters and no one is safe from dying off. This makes each episode a nail biter. Don't get attached to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run is a awesome and fun game that everyone should play including adults and you would never get tired of this game but that's just my opinion.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved this book. I expected Eva to run every time she didn't get her way or things made her mad.  Glad to see she did a little growing up and realized Gideon did things for her safety not because he was being selfish.  NOT going to jump on the bandwagon and bash this book, it was really good!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very helpful app!!!  I refer to The Weather Channel often and this makes it so convenient!  Recommend highly!!  Thank you!
B001V5CIFI|5.0|this movie was very intriguing for my kids and they sat glued to watch it. Good theme behind it. They still talk about it with some of the scenes with the kids
0307596885|2.0|This is one of the most boring books I have read.  It is a series of depressing stories that do not have an ending.  Even after a long discussion at our book group with our facilitator, I still did not enjoy the book.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Lousy, hard to follow, makes no sense, not there best effort, like to forget it. Who came up with this movie?
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I believe we are energy (spiritual) beings here to learn and grow in this reality.  So this movie resonated with me.  I watched it a second time as it can be a little disconcerting with the theme switching time frames and individual storylines.  I enjoyed it more the second time around. I would definitely recommend this movie if one believes in multiple lives or isn’t closed minded.  It was serious and had humor, and I thought Tom Hanks was exceptional.
030789701X|5.0|Has David Hodgson ever let us down .... EVER? In all my TES experience (and several other titles to boot) the answer to that question is emphatically NO!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|WTH....That was not an ending, heck, it wasn't even a good cliff hanger point.  I read this knowing it was going to be a five part series and not and I still felt like the ending was horrible.  And that was on top of all the other problems I had with the book.<br /><br />I agree with lots of other reviews about the first half of the book.  Lots of sex, but really no moving the story forward.  After awhile the sex didn't even seem steamy or worthwhile, because I was left wondering when we were going to get to something else.  Then the second half has all these new subplots and characters, most of which are not necessary.  Sure I get you don't want Eva and Gideon to ride off into the sunset without dealing with their issues, facing their past or learning to cope with the challenges life presents, but that's just it they don't seem to be dealing at all.  In fact, Gideon seems to be walking around trying to solve everyone's problems in secret.  Which has always been part of Eva's trust issues.  Sure he tells her about them afterwards but that's soo not the point.<br /><br /> **Spoilers: Deana was the only new plot line that was even worth it, unless you count Ann at the end of the story.  There is very little mention to Eva having it out with Gideon about using their love to protect her from his 'sacrifice' (which we all know she would have done based on the person she becomes at the end of Book 2). In fact, overall there is very little of Gideon and Eva even talking about/acknowleding what has happened and that was huge. Sure it grants them some more trust but that doesn't mean there are feelings and guilt to work through. There are stupid fillers like Corrine's insistent obsession and her husband coming into the picture, Megumi being sick and Cary's newest problem with Tatiana..really this is sooo not needed. The Nathan bracelet could have been worthwhile if it had been an actual part of the book and not just something dropped in here and there, but the mob connectionreally did take it over the top.  The proposal...are you kidding me. Gideon himself built that up for Eva and it was such a let down.  It didn't have to be over the top romance or anything but at least acknowledgement about how Eva feels. And probably worse of all we've yet to see another session with Dr. Peterson for anyone: Gideon and Eva, Gideon alone, Eva alone, Monica, or even a suggestion for Cary to find a therapist in NY or at least setup weekly/monthly calls with Dr. Travis.  This can't be as none of these people are completely healed.  They all need help and that's part of why we love them. The Brett situation is now annoying, partly because we have all these other things going on, and mostly because additional drama is added in at the end of the book. (I mean wasn't the Brett situation complicated enough with him being an ex, the song and the video.  Did we really need anything else).  And while we get answers to some questions, they are basically tossed aside as though the answers or reasoning behind them has not been pivotal in shaping the characters and their relationships with other characters.  Characters who were lead to believe in book one and two would be pivotal and yet seem to be in the shadows and nonexistent in this book.**<br /><br />I'm wondering what the heck Sylvia's beta reader(s) was thinking. Maybe she got a longer version of the story or a different version so she has a different take.  Overall, I'm not sure what has happened to the characters and this book did not live up to my expectation or even compel me to remain a loyal reader of the series. I'm not sure if I'll be reading book 4 or 5, but if I do I definitely won't be rushing to get them.  I can live with a little disappointment but this is ridiculous.  Sylvia your a good writer but this was definitely not up to par for your skills.e rushing to get them.  I can live with a little disappointment but this is ridiculous.  Sylvia your a good writer but this was definitely not up to par for your skills.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Yes, I give it five stars because I know this book deserve it! First of all, I believe their story should continue on because of so many problems in their life. How can a book just end with a happy ending but at the same time have so many questions, or situations that shouldn't be toss out like that. I agree that Sylvia should continue on the story and make her readers happy by actually having a happy, happy ending for Gideon and Eva. They deserve it and so does our hearts! I'm just hoping four and five comes out soon and not next year! I'm dying here waiting for it to continue.<br /><br />Alright, as for the story of Gideon and Eva, it's even getting better! In this book I felt Eva is much more stronger and fights for Gideon. And as usual, Gideon is ALWAYS fighting for Eva. Let's just say both characters are stronger in this book because they both just want to be together, dammit! But everyone and everything is making it so difficult. But that doesn't stop them from seeing each other or loving each other more. So, Corrine is an ass in this book. Always finding a way to make Gideon have time for her. Her husband sounds very good looking except he seems to be more into money and power than into loving and fighting for her. Brett was okay. He was very forward with Eva , but I felt he should be since they did have hot chemistry before. She did still have some sexual sparks towards Brett, but at least she not doing anything with him. They are just being friends, just like how Gideon runs around trying to take care of Corrine too. So it's even. Towards the end, I did felt like Sylvia was cutting things short but I guess if it doesn't need to expand more then it's okay. No biggie.  Overall, this book was awesome. I can't wait for the next two to come out. I know the way how it was left was just, 'huh' but it's better than left hanging there with a 'what?!' or a 'nnnoooo.' There are also shocking things and unhappy things but that's what makes it interesting. There are lots, lots, and lots of unanswered questions/things that I'm dying to figure out. Like I say before, Gideon and Eva have too many things that needs to be smooth out before they could have their happily ever after, so Ms. Sylvia keep doing what you do best! You did a wonderful job! I will be waiting for their happily ever after! Just don't make me wait tooooo long!
B00821OX98|5.0|Okay, so I'm hooked. My wife finds it too &#34;mushy&#34; and &#34;talkative&#34; -- which surprises me since she loves all the &#34;Grey's Anatomy-type&#34; shows...! Very predictable, cheesy in many ways, and brainless. Easy to get lost in. Kind of like The Walking Dead, but with cheesier lines, filming, and aliens instead of zombies. Less gruesome.
B00338QENI|5.0|I started this book not knowing anything about HeLa, very easy to read and understand. I'm off to learn more now.
B000JML7EC|5.0|The E reader version is easily accessible and easy to read.  This is a great story for readers of all ages.
0988936402|4.0|The First Pillar is the highly amusing beginnings of a series of novels containing somewhat elements of The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, The Talisman/Black House, within a very strong sword & sorcery fantasy structured parallel worlds storyline. Written with a simple very readable style and has well constructed characters suitable for mid-grade (pre-teen) children and above with no real major excessive violence narratively depicted.<br /><br />Greatly stroked my interest in reading the next novel to be offered in the series.
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|Best Star Trek movie ever.  The Blu Ray is loaded with interesting extras.  If you've never seen this before you're missing out.  If you HAVE seen it before you owe it to yourself to see it now.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was a thrilling,suspenseful and sweet story(all rolled up into one great movie). It's the type of movie that you can relate to and know there is hope and true love out there...
B004U8VWLE|1.0|I am normally pretty quick on the uptake, but, this was far more confusing than entertaining. It was sad, vulgar and made it appear that all ballet dancers are self-destructive and manipulative and hateful. Even if this is so, it made for an ugly movie.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Needs work to fix the plot faults.  There are some really big holes in the plot that a good writer could have easily fixed.
B009R659L8|5.0|I did rate this four as I thought it was a crime solving mystery, well written---keeping the audience in suspense.  One of the better novels I have read as it makes you sorry it ended.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|The story should have ended here but it didn't and two more in the making. I'm not so sure I will be buying them
0307346617|5.0|A good book that accounts for the zombie apocalypse from the beginning to the end, which covers all areas of the world.  Great little stories from the people who actually survie it.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|I love Gary Clark Jr. and his potential is infinite...however, he either doesn't want to be niched, or he doesn't know what type of music he wants to do. He is best at playing the blues, but does some R&B as well on the CD. The R&B music is very good (in it's own right), but it is too hard to get into the groove of listening when the music doesn't flow and jumps between heavy blues guitar rocking and then R&B.
B0037QM8YA|1.0|I found it very depressing, though I realize these situations are all too true and frequent.  The language was relentlessly offensive. About the time that it was starting to turn around and we could see what positive reinforcement and encouragement can do it was over.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love this series. I knew it wasnt going to be a trilogy having followed the blogs and Sylvia's website so no complaints. However, this installment felt more like a tease- the story was interesting but then got really good at the last 3 chapters and then just ENDED. Like until next time. There was no ending or wrap up, just lots of loose ends. One major event happens, which was lovely but I am equating this book's ending to what I experienced with a similar writer- Beth Kery. She did a series last year which turned out to be seven or eight books at 1.99 or more a pop that ended up being like 7 chapters each and then ended in such a sucky way that I just stopped buying these types of books all together. I hope Ms. Day has more respect for her fans than to pull that. EWY could and SHOULD have at the price and the length of time we waited for it had at least 10 more chapters and could have still been another book or two. I am a fan of her other work but I was definitely disapointed in the shortness and the way in which it ended. We deserved more from someone so talented.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Gotta give the devs credit... its pretty damn good for a second I almost thought it was psychic... except soneyimes you have to give it too many clues and sonetimes the same questions repeat
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This film is just a fun film about kids being kids.  The characters interact in a very realistic way.  There is some mature language and some violence, but at it's heart, the film is good-natured fun.  May not be appropriate for young children.  SPOILER ALERT:  The scene with the train is one of the most spectacular I have ever seen.  I wish it looked as good on my home tv screen as it did on the movie theater screen!!
159448385X|5.0|Loved this book.  A fascinating story that explains the background to a lot of the problems in Afganistan today.  Often sad and touching, but unable to put the book down.  Recomended highly.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but the quality was shaky. It was mostly HD, but even after downloading it (which took about an hour) some parts would play in SD.  I'm a little disappointed in Amazon's quality.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Cast, dialogue and soundtrack are all excellent.  The transition between the beginning of &#34;You Can't Always Get What you Want&#34; and the Rolling Stones' version is masterful.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Ok first of all I did honestly like the book. It started off slow but I thought this book was a trilogy. I waited for a long time for this book to come out now I have to wait 6 months for another book? Im not too happy about waiting that long between books. Next time this author is going to say a book is a trilogy then that's what I'm expecting.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|? yes, but it will take you on a trip that might not be enjoyable for every one, but none the less was worth my time.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|I'm not a big shoot'em-up game player but i like this one.  It's rather pointless but it looks great, it sounds fun, and it's useful for passing wait-room time.  And, as has been shown to be rather important for a Kindle Fire HD app, it LOADS and PLAYS every time I want it to.
B00B2GK4KW|4.0|It works very well, is very easy to use, and is not too big to store in your craft space.
B001AW156U|1.0|bought these to replace the ones I bough at gamestop, and even though both are little pieces of plastic, these disappoint. These aren't the ones you receive if you order. The packaging makes it look like a quality product but all you will receive is a small baggie, it does come with the thumbstick covers, but I'd rather get the item I ordered. Not happy at all about this purchase.
0679805273|5.0|Great as usual dealing with Amazon. Fast shipping and great new condition! The perfect graduation gift and makes a student's experience with Dr, Suess come full circle!
B00CRW2066|5.0|What I love about The National is that they will say it like it is. There is no sugar coating or lovey-dovey romance in the lyrics. Berninger's voice is brooding and cynical in a way that makes you hopeful about life. Songs like &#34;Demons,&#34; make you think &#34;yeah, I feel that way too. Let's have a beer and talk about it.&#34; In fact, that is the way I feel about the whole album: I want to have a beer and hang out with it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|..but compared to the other Bourne movies it does not have the same intensity and something that i can't quite put my finger on..<br />i don't think it's the actors..it's worth watching but don't expect a true Bourne again experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good game for kids and adults. I play this game all the time especially when I am bored.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I'm rating this based on Excel functionality as that's the most important item in the office suite for me. If you like to create your documents in a web interface like Google Drive or Skydrive, then this app works pretty well with those formats. But if you're wanting to open up a lab report excel spreadsheet with special formats and functionality, then this works maybe part of the time. However, if that's what you're wanting, then that's not really what mobile devices are meant for anyway. For an office suite on a mobile device, this is the best one out there.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter has fantastic writing and great acting. Always thought provoking and entertaining. This was one of my favorite seasons so far.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Great design and sound. The only down side is I've been using it hours on end.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have always liked spider solitaire and I like the mobility ware games. This is fun to play when u are just sitting around, awesome for a free game!
044024613X|4.0|Suspensful, very different from any other mystery that I've read.<br />Does anyone really know another person, much less their own children very well???
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app!!!!! Everything about it is awesome. There are lots of fun effects and features! Deffintally worth downloading! :)
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Will challenge you to think about death, including your own. I wanted to keep reading but the story ends abruptly. This man had such honest and intriguing thoughts in all of his books. I enjoy reading everything he wrote.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|great movie  Got for my sons birthday  Hes 15  thank you  i hope to be doing more shopping with your company  This is a little too long to deal with
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm not sure what was not to like about Entwined With You....Gideon was his sexy panty-melting self, the sex was HOT and steamy and there was drama...in my opinion what more could you ask for!!  I also am very excited that I don't have to say good-bye to Gideon as soon as I thought...the more Gideon the better!!  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it.  On another note...I don't understand why people would leave a review for a book that they did not even read.  That just seems silly to me...they have no idea if they liked it or not and leaving a bad review based on somebody else's review is just not right!!
B001P3SA94|4.0|I love how it starts out and to hear the truth how the beach boys took some of their songs along with some other people I love Etta James  and it was nice to see that a Jew arron brody gave them the chance to be famous.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I bought this album for my daddy for a early father's day present and he absolutely loves it. Keep up the great job.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My favorite part is that I can download more sounds for free, and mix sounds. It's really convenient, and I sleep better.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Angst, love, tragedy, and the strength to choose a different path than the one laid out in front of you!  While this is a &#34;young adult&#34; novel, with high-school aged characters, it is a story that is still gripping for all ages.<br />It's one that reaffirms the belief that love knows no boundaries.<br />Definitely worth reading.....you won't be disappointed!!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|loved every second of this one. that chic has an incredible voice. all the songs are awesome in their own different ways. unlike some artists albums, it didn't sound like the same song over and over.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am satisfied with my purchased. The article arrived within the time alloted.  The packaging was sturdy and elegant.  The added bag is a bonus and of a strong material.<br />The sound is great, and outside noises are barely audible.  My ears are completely covered and I don't feel any pressure on head.  I love listening to my music and videos with it.<br />Overall I am quite happy.
B00985E3UG|5.0|A book which really makes you think. This should be a required reading in high school. Knowledge can and should be power.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I really like this app. It gives you a list of genres and in the genres another list of genres. So for example your in the first list and you select fiction, then in the second list you select romance. After you get through the 2 lists it gives you a whole lists of free books that are available. But unlike free ebooks pro you can't search books. But that's the only difference. So don't think you have to buy free ebooks pro, cause it's pretty much the same thing. But yes I love this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is cool because u cannt get board and its and i fun for everyone I play it a lot and u can win prizes
1607066017|5.0|I purchased this based on amazon's recommendation due to my reading Fables, Unwritten, and Sandman. I like your standard superhero stuff (Wonder Woman, Superman, X-Men), but I find that I appreciate the lesser known stories a little more. Maybe because I've seen the other stuff all my life and these stories are completely new to me. In any case, I thought the art was fantastic in this, to the point that I want to find other books that Fiona has illustrated. And the story is pretty great, something I want to keep reading.<br /><br />Side note: This series is probably not suitable for kids.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|This book is good at showing new designs. The instructions are also super easy to follow. I would recommend this book to people who already have experience in weaving
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun an addicting. I think it should be a award winning game. I like to jump on train and get chase by police.
B000002HFU|5.0|Trying to describe \\"Return...\\" is nigh useless. You really have to hear this CD. There was nothing like this before and there's been nothing like it since. Even ODB's own follow-up isn't on par with \\"Return...\\"<br /><br />The older this CD gets, and the farther away we get from that 90s era of Wu-Tang, Biggie, Nas, Mobb Deep, Big Pun and Busta Rhymes, the more revolutionary and iconoclastic this CD becomes. RIP ODB!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app can specifically guess who your thinking of. All you have to do is answer questions, so kinda like the 20 questions game. You should totally get it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is an amazing game it is the best horse game I love the graphics they are amazing it is a great game for horse lovers
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it.<br /><br />This is one of my favourite series.<br /><br />Love Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />Can't wait to see if more info comes out about Victor.<br /><br />I'm so happy that there are more books coming out.<br /><br />Sylvia Day is a fantastic writer.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Sometimes when I play this game my keyboard shows up on the screen and doesn't go away and it makes it impossible to play the level!<br />(Fix this and it's 5 stars.)
B0041D843M|4.0|I rarely even consider books covering nutrition, but it was recommended by someone I trusted so I took a look.  The first thing that stood out to me was the fact that it was a 400+ page book for only $10!  That stood out to me as an author trying to get a message out... not an author trying to make money on a fad.  The content is very interesting.  I'm currently in the &#34;experiment&#34; stage, so I can't share my own experience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THE PC IS MY FAVIRATE THANK YOU NOTCH AND MOJANG AND THERE SOMETHING CALLED SURVIVALCRAFT THATS STEELING ALL OF MINECRAFTS IDEAS YOU MITE WANT TO DO SOMETHING SOON CAUSE IT MITE GET OUT OF CONTROLL BUT SURVIVALCRAFT SUCKS TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :( :)
B001F290E4|5.0|If you enjoy vocals by Seal, I recommend his CD of old soul favorites... expressed with much passion and love for the content.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Bad sound quality. With my sound turned all the way up you still only hear in a whisper...on all of my devices.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It is so hard to stump. I only stumped it on  time then it asked another question and I  got it. This app is amazing I think everyone should get it of course I got it when it was free.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I displays the first few letters of the question and nothing else. It is not playable on my Nook tablet.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It is a peculiar but a great book. I would recommend to everyone who wants the experience of their life
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this was an enjoyable book...It's probably one of the more pivotal books in the series.<br /><br />However, I would need to warn the reader to remember this book revolves around 2 Psy..not a mixed relationshipe, not a regular changeling relationship.  As a result, the tone in this book is different than the others, but it makes sense.<br /><br />As a reader, I would say that the blurb/teaser for the book is inadequate and misleading.  To me, it would be more meaningful(?) if the author just went straight out and stated it was a Councillor who turned out to be the Ghost instead the reality.  (of course, the storyline and tone would be differnt and more action packed, I believe, so...maybe it's a test of a different tone in the books)<br /><br />The hero, I would say, can be related to...The heroine, is (like another reviewer words)  a little of Mary Sue.  One could almost be confused on what her actual Psy designation was...or if she's a mix of changeling/human (she sounds more empathetic than sascha and after only a short period of receuperating in a cardinals' house after years of captivity and then going to a changeling den...it's one thing for being able adapt quickly...oh well (I understand the words \\"You're mine\\" and being possessive, but...wouldn't rational thought make a person have second thoughts...any second thoughts?!)  She also continues to claim \\"walking in darkness\\" by wiping the mind of a person or two, but ti's in trade for her own personality (uh, she's under duress...and for the majority of the developing years, she's in captivity?!?!  how much choice does she have in being the executor of \\"darkness\\"?)...I'm just wondering...why couldn't a J-Psy do a memory retraction on some of the situations that pop up in the book...<br /><br />In any case, this book in its own way came from left field...it's enjoyable, but I would recommend to wait for the paperback to come out so the price drops...<br /><br />I'm more looking forward to a hopefully alice/vasic or aden story or bowen's story...I think people are more used to the \\"mixed\\" dynamic sort of stories than changline stories that have no mating bonds or of 2 psy.  i'm also looking forward to seeing how the author disposes of shoshanna scott and ming.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a very good game it's super duper fun and very affordable to be a very good game. The only one that is not a very long boring game. It's a free kids game. The  cars are very cool. They are cool cars..
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is one of the &#34;coolest movies I've ever seen. Cooper and Lawrence are both terrific actors and have a great chemistry together. Robert De Niro does a great job as well. This film is a great combination of drama, character development, comedy and dance - (believe it or not). You expect actors to be good actors, but Cooper and Lawrence are great dancers as well. Don't miss this one. it's a great one for your personal collection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I never thought I would need a calculator on my kindle, but it is great to have handy. I am so glad I chose this app over the others! Everything about it is great!!!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|If you like the GTA(grand theft auto) series then you`ll love this game! The graphics are similar to early ps1 games. Very blocky and the game controls can be a bit clumsy but overall fast paced gameplay &amp; interesting story line. Keeps you entertained for a short while since the game gets a bit repetitive,but I`m sure once the game evolves more then the map &amp; storyline will expand. Great price too but I`m sure it will be on sale in the near future.
B00ABO609A|3.0|Considering that most gay cinema is patently awful, this is a breath of fresh air, but it's still really just okay. While we get to know the character of Erik fairly well, Paul is kept at a distance. Necessarily so since that's the nature of the character, but there needed to be a way to make the audience care more about what's at stake while also maintaining that distance. A respectable effort.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read all three, this one by far was my favorite . Now I can't wait for the fourth book to come out.
B005544V6A|5.0|I like the characters and their personalities...the actors do this very well.<br />There is a lot of delightful humor, but also serious legal plots in every episode.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great game enjoyed playing it. Awesome graphics! Nice story line. The demons were made great. The getting room to room is a little annoying because of the lack of arrows and i have to double click to go to that room. But other than that i enjoyed playing the game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I finally found a great and fun game that I really enjoy ,since I love forensics,detective work and puzzles .if you like those things than you'll like this game.I strongly recommend it !....so give it a shot ;)
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Horrible. I wish I could unhear it. Its just one horrible 90 minute song.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have never seen a solitaire game that you can win as frequently as you can this one even without the hints.  The potential for winning prevents the frustration you sometimes feel with other solitaire solitaire games.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|ample storage for all my recent vacation pics and still have ample storage left.  let me easily access pics from all my mobile devices.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I love Alice In Chains! I love all the old albums, always will. But it's nice to have a collection of new albums to listen to over and over. Jerry and William sing and harmonize together really well. The AIC sound is still there.<br /> I think if they continue to make albums, William will have more of a forefront with his vocals, it seems they are still experimenting with that.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|The only critique I have is it can get monotonous to play but with a little more added to it it could be just that much better. it's adorable and simple to figure out, and with a little more would keep any kid entertained for hours
B0095P29EG|4.0|Well paced story with both good action and decent plot and acting. Much better than I expected. Special effects particularly with the robot were really cool.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wonderful story, felt the deep emotions of a family struggling to protect their son.  Also was suspenseful  with quite a surprise ending.  Couldn't  put it down till the end.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Another great book it's hard to find a serious where the second book as as great as the first or maybe even better
B005544TRQ|5.0|These guys are a great team.  What I like about this is that his mentor, character says all the right exact things about every situation.  The writer(s) seem to put his persona together like nothing I have ever seen.  I look forward to it coming on prime for season 2.  If you like a lot of humor, suspense and drama this is the show for you.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The quality is superb and even makes the phantom menace a good movie to watch!  Totally worth purchasing, and the deal/price made it just that much better!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Unusual subject matter, beautifully acted and expressed.  Casting was completely wonderful and the movie is worth watching more than once.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I'm a retired cop and while corruption exists in any profession, it goes way over the top in this series. Regardless, it's entertaining and some of the acting is good.<br /><br />The most realistic police drama I've seen is 'The Wire'. If you are interested in seeing what being a cop is like in a moderate size US city, watch that series.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great show, its a shame it is no longer on. Not thrilled that the first 3 seasons were free to watch if your a prime member then they charge you for the last season if you want to watch it. I will just have to wait until it is free to watch :)
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This has been the best Movies ever done for Batman. And the Trilogy pack with the 3 DVD movies very nice. Package arrived on time and in good condition.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited forever for this story, I felt this series was better the fs of g but now after book 3 not even looking forward to book 4. Horrible and flat ending. Took forever to write and finish this book what wait another year for book 4? No thank you not after the way this book was written
1401234550|5.0|We are very happy with the product.  Exactly as described.  Would purchase from this seller again. Perfect condition.  This is a great product for those Green Lantern junkies.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Gideon and Eva's story should have ended with this book. I am not going to buy book 4.<br />I felt G & E have finally gotten to a good place in their quasi normal relationship. They had gone through rape, murder, ex-girlfriends, ex-boyfriends, hateful family members, misunderstands and distrust. Finally they accept each other as is and the book ends with &#34;to be continue&#34;. Leave them alone to have babies and trust in their love to fight for their future happiness no matter what. That is my ending to this book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was not sure if I wanted to invest in this book or not based on some reviews and the variability in books on NDE.  I got the free download sample and it was so depressing with the darkness and middle-earth feeling of his initial experience, so I decided not to buy the book.  However, I kept coming across it and finally just committed.  I bought the book.  It was a very good book and I am very glad I bought it.  I believe Dr. Alexander had the specific, amazing experience of contracting an illness in a manner that seems impossible, that he experienced the long-term coma with no brain activity, and his remarkable NDE experience because of his specific profession.  He provides concrete, irrefutable evidence that the NDE was an experience of his soul and not his brain (not that I needed convincing), and it is spectacular when you consider the depth of the meaning.  Great book!
B001Q7JD5O|4.0|One of my favorite Movies. BUT... if they made 4 movies in one box 1933 King Kong, King Kong 2005, Son of Kong, and King Kong vs Godzilla. It was a really Long Movie and when I'm Done At playing a 2and a half game of Battle ship AND I'M ONLY ON THE KONG VS DINO SCENE! Anyway I loved this movie so well! King Kong is so good... It's (PUN ALERT) a ape of a movie! It's like climbing and surviving the fall of the Empire State Building and winning million $ and All King Kong Movies!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|haven't read the books. Wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The plot made little sense to me and defied most logic. The only thing that would have made it better would be to really commit to the premise and give it a hard R rating and just show little kids violently murdering each other. Then at least you could say it followed through on such a disturbing premise it was trying to convey. As it stands it's just dumb to me.
0307352153|4.0|it gives a different look at the difference between introverts and extroverts and essentially helps you to deal with these two types of people.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I think this is a wonderful story.  I have been &#34;hooked&#34; since the first book and I am eager for the next one to come out.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I recenty watched \\"Into the Wild\\" and loved the movie.<br />What really moved me was the music.<br />I realized early on I knew \\"the voice\\"....Vedder naturally.<br />I'm not a huge PJ fan but I fell in love with this release.<br />Vedder's voice is perfect for this kind of barren, campfire...middle of nowhere kind of music.<br />Simply a brilliant non-metal, non-rock album.<br />Short, sweet and I can't stop listening to it.<br />Recommended.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|This movie was not what I expected from Denzel Washington.  I did not expect nudity and so much profanity and drugs.  Definately NOT a family movie.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|This app goes smutty on the first try.  It asked us if the character he was guessing was a porn star!  Are you kidding?!  I deleted it from my kindle right then.  This was a free app of the day 6/5/2013. No good.
0425263924|1.0|I waited so long for this book. I don't think I can wait another 9 months to read about a possible happily ever after for Gideon and Eva. Plus I have heard that maybe it will take two more books to get to a HEA. There was so much about this book I hated.  I hated the reporter. I hated Tatiana. I hated Eva's crazy mom and now I even hate her dad (What was Sylvia thinking?) I hated that Gideon would leave for days and not tell Eva where he is. I hated the new story line with Michael and Eva's receptionist  I really hated that Eva continued to feel attracted to Brett when she has Gideon. A lot of it was just not believable. I felt like from what I knew about the characters their actions just did not make sense. Everyone was acting just to stupid to live!  I hated that Corinne is still causing trouble. I just feel sad that this book fell so far below my expectations.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|An interesting view 'inside' the workings of the US Presidency. I am learning a lot. Well written and has a cohesive time line.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this app is very fun and extremely addicting but can call for real money, unless you know what you are doing.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Frances Hodgson Burnett was a terrific writer. You can feel into these children's hearts as you read this story. Simply magnificent!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm so sad! This was horrible. No sweet loving scenes. Really didn't answer much and just tossed in a silly amount of story lines at the end. I will NOT read anything else in this series. Wish I could give it less than one star :(
B002L3ARRU|5.0|One of the most emblematic movies from the eighties!!! A must-see!!! Definitely one of my favorite movies growing up. If you want to have a good laugh, this is the movie to watch.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|So very creative and beautiful !!  Definitely worth watching many times; Great family entertainment that I think will certainly hold the kids attention.
B002361MLA|5.0|It's amazing how each spiritual development book I read comes along at the perfect time in my life.  I've been actively on my spiritual journey for seven years now.  I had begun to feel frustrated because I felt stuck.  This book was what I needed.  It's made it possible to start applying and living all of the principles I've read about in other books. I kept thinking that if I did this or that by next year I would be where I wanted to be.  I didn't realize that by constantly focusing on the future I was wasting the true power I had which was right now in this present moment.  I have never felt so aware and alive.  I highly recommend this book.

B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a very fun game and I recommend it, but the graphics are not what I suspected, they aren't as good as the other Temple Runs. Not at all
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Though it's missing the diagonal stone Lansky's version has.  Very handy though, and indeed does fit in a pocket.  Cheap enough to keep one with each different set of gear for different activities.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I am absolutely in love with Corazon Profundo, and so is my mother! These songs are great additions to our already large collection of Carlos Vives' music and it's on constant replay in our car. Very upbeat tunes with some wonderful language and emotional mixes throughout. I can only hope he keeps it up!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I was a little hesitant about buying this one, because so many movies and programs today seem to belittle our founding fathers.  However, this one isn't in that category.  It was well-researched and shows the nobility, as well as the warts, of John Adams.  In my mind, Abigail almost steals the story away.  I would have loved knowing this woman and calling her friend.  Definitely worth the price.  I've watched it several times and will watch it many more.
0425263924|1.0|I really was enjoying this series and thought this book would be a great way to wrap up all the loose end.  Instead it left me questioning the integrity of the characters.  It seems she was trying to introduce  and devolp characters she could use in her next couple box when really they just dont matter to Eve and Gideon's story (and they are why we are buying these books).  If she wanted to develop sub character I wish she would have wrote a book or series about them a spin off perhaps but instead Gideon and Eve's relationship be dragged out and watered down.  I have also lost respect for an author I loved and trusted to bring me great romance.  This book just left me frustrated.  I think Sylvia and I are done.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is so talented. The rest of the cast is great too. I loved each and every episode. My favorite clone was Helena.  Cra-cray!
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This true story will hold you spellbound.  I am amazed by the courage and stamina of the two German climbers.  They should be remembered and this film achieves just that.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Children of all primary ages enjoy this story of a princess who goes after her loved one, only to realize that he isn't worth it.  Actually, everyone enjoys it, in my experience, child or not.  The art work is wonderful, and the story charming.  It never gets old, which is typical of Munsch books.  He's one of my favorite authors, and children feel the same.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I was really looking forward this this record, I was not disappointed.  I never am with QOTSA.  If I Had a Tail is my favorite track.  I can't hear the guest performers though.
0544103750|5.0|This lovely volume of a timeless classic is a great way to pass on this wonderful story.  It should be in everyone's library.
B008Y73940|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I love love Matthew McConaughey!!!  It was hard to keep up with at times, but I liked it.  It had a good outcome!!!
B000U6BT40|5.0|I'm apparently late in discovering this show.  Now I plan to watch all the seasons available on Amazon Prime.  It is now second on my list of favorites after The Big Bang Theory.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Picks up right where book 2 left off.  Up to late hours reading as can't put book down.  Must read
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Can not wait for season 3!  This show has it all!  Horror, religion, freaks, and surprises!  Have watched it twice since buying it! Absolutely a wicked show!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This very honest and unbiased biography of Steve Jobs is inspiring and invigorating. Whether a member of the cult of Apple or not, you're sure to respect them after reading this book.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|THIS IS COOL!  It is a whole new take on hidden object games.  I'm recently began oil painting and it is a joy to explore and find great art you can actually buy!  Art Mogal has a large variety of paintings to view, bid on, authenticate by finding differences and sell for maximum profit.  Building subject oriented collections adds a unique twist to hidden object searching.<br /><br />I do feel there was an opportunity missed here.  Paintings are identified by title and artist but a little art history would have been a bonus.  Artists dates and date of the works as well as country of origin might have been useful and instructive.  It might also serve as clues to where the art would sell for maximum profit.  Museums could express preferences for a style or subject matter to guide purchasing, not just the auction houses.<br /><br />Overall, At Mogul is a real hoot for visual artists.  I highly recommend it.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Being able to show the different generation and how one single  event changed the life's of so many is what pulls you into this movie.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This movie was great. Both my wife and I loved it I have told a number of my frendes to get it.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|The game only remembers its win stats. It had lost  several times but still says it is right all the time. Kind of like an annoying friend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can never get enough of Gideon and Eva.  This book did not disappoint such as other reviewers are suggesting.  Although I do dislike having to wait for another book in the series to be written and released, this book was good and I do recommend it!  Some reivewers are suggesting that Sylvia is only writing two more because she is money hungry.  Have you ever thought that maybe she didn't realize this series would be such a big hit with people still wanting more, that maybe she is doing this for her fans too and not just money reasons???  Whatever the case, stop knocking her down with the bad reviews.  This book was excellent!  Can't wait for the next book in this series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Cool game. Lots of free time spent playing this game. Would recommend for anyone who likes object search type games.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Putting aside how seriously and boring the story is, the real shocker is that Tom Hanks was very disappointing in the 12,000 characters he plays.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I expected them to hate it, get bored and walk away. We all actually really enjoyed the movie. There were funny parts and lots of excitement to keep everyone interested. The love story part wasn't all sappy either.... though I did shed a tear at one point. Overall an enjoyable movie that met even the high standards of the guys in the house.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Season 1 was great. Season 2 is slowing down a little. But the actors are ALL good, the storyline just needs a little more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a really fun game but I wish it could download faster I deleted like 5 games and it has none done on downloading but this game is awesome
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely fabulous! The acting and content is superb. Can't watch just one at a time! Get ready for a long night!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My dad ordered it and it said won't it was not able to download, and to say I'm pissed. But I know its an awesome game so buy it.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|This is worse than shoot em up which at least had humor.  Jamie Fox could not emote anything.  His facial expression was blank from beginning to end.  The scenes were ginsued and then slopped back together.  It was ridiculous!  It was painful to watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very addicting if your a couple, if your single you might not get into it, not sure why, that's just how it goes.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Mis is my favorite musical of all time, and I just had to have this in my library. I have used only the Blu-ray, and not even sure why the other functions are available.
B007T99ENE|3.0|This book had me on and off my seat.It frustrated me, enthralled me. I couldn't let it go.Bitter tooth! bravo!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I've read a lot from Jeffrey Archer -- he's a favorite -- but the first two in this series were better than the third.
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|Despite there being instructions, every time I play, I somehow get it wrong. Maybe its just me, but I didnt have the patience to really figure it out. I gave it two stars just because my three year old likes to try to play, and likes penguins.
B0086700CM|5.0|Got this for the wife.  She loves it and enjoys playing the game for relaxation and entertainment.  Would recommend to others!
B000002L68|5.0|I purchased this album because Purple Rain is one of my favorite movies.  The album is great it has all the original recordings and was shipped quickly.
B001NUO1HE|5.0|I like movies with tropical settings and ocean scenes. It was exciting to watch and had a good storyline and good acting.
1451695195|5.0|Good thing this doctor has great credentials, or his story might not be belieable.  Wonderful explanations on a topic that everyone is interested in.  A good read, and I recommend it.
B004VWH3KI|1.0|I am rating this one because I never got the product. I complained to the store and they did nothing.  The USPS said it was sent to my home but it was not. The Book Worm service was unresponsive.  I would not use this company again!
B002EMESSM|3.0|The first of the Star Trek franchise movies is an excellent episode in the style of the original series. It really did not require a feature-length treatment, however at the time when the series and franchise was thought extinct, I can see how it happened.

057511097X|5.0|I had this book on pre-order when it was listed as book 12 no title.  I have recently re-read the whole series, including the novellas in anticipation of having the book delivered (which came a week early as I ordered the american edition).  So I had a go at predicting  (1) Who the Ghost was, (2) Who was the woman at the end of Tangle of Need  and (3)  Who was the boy who rescued Annie as a child in the novella \\"Stroke of Enticement\\".  Needless to say I was right, but I won't spoil it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book, and it was nice to have a full Psy couple instead of of psy/changeling, changeling/human couples.  Though the couple concerned are complete opposites in terms of \\"Silence\\", one broken, one unable to break.  I admit that I did miss the changelings in this book, but I predict we will see more of them, as I would like to see how many pupcubs a certain couple will have!<br /><br />As another reviewer mentions the war isn't over.  Just think of the ramifications of feeling emotions when you have been trained/tortured since birth not to feel.  Don't forget Pure Psy is still out there!
B007SOQBCM|3.0|This app is successful in allowing me to watch Twitch streams, but it has a few key flaws. First, you can't log in, meaning you can't look for streams you have followed easily, nor can you chat. Secondly, it doesn't show every stream - streams need a certain amount of viewers to be shown, which is a pain as I like watching speedrunners and some niche streams that don't have that many viewers, so I can't watch them with this app.
B000LJ9ZWE|5.0|Being a bit of a Sci Fi and Western buff, I was amazed that I had let this gem slip by until now. I love the premise, I love the campy acting, I love the bar fights, and I love the seventies perspective on apocalyptic doom. Not a deep movie, but a fun movie to watch if you like PKD, Deadwood, or maybe even Lost in Space.
B00821OX98|3.0|Typical end of the world story line. Not much different than Revolution that's on TV now, just has aliens, but story line seems to be the same as most series like this.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this series due to the low price and some good reviews on Amazon. Little did I know that I would fall in love with the people of Silo 18. The writing and character development in these novels is excellent as is the pacing. Everything builds throughout the series to where you can barely put the books down.

It seems devious and greedy. :(<br /><br />I'm Finished With You and sadly Gideon. I'll miss these characters, but I've been mentally prepared for a trilogy. By the time the next book comes out I'm sure I'll have forgotten all about them and given my good money to another author.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|This season was as good as the first, and the war was incorporated into the story line pretty smoothly. The reason I wouldn't quite give it five stars is that nearly everything gets wrapped up into a neat little bow. Sybil's storyline also becomes a little far-fetched.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the characters and the story.  Definitely recommend this one for anyone wanting a fun but intense read.  Great human commentary and goes into the dark side of personalities & relationships.
B004QX07G4|1.0|Do not waste your money. Don't buy it. I am a fan of Ellen but this is such a bad book, she just talks about whatever comes in her head.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A wonderful, thrilling book!! Lots of twists and turns, and you will never believe the ending!! This book was wonderful!
0345529057|3.0|The Game of Thrones series is GREAT. I have no complaints about the actual content of the series, as I have found it absolutely riveting and a page-\\"clicker\\".<br /><br />That said, I do not recommend getting the bundle for the Kindle. I had not realized it, but all four books are crammed into a single Kindle file, meaning it is even harder than normal to tell how far into a book you are. This is frustrating, particularly when it comes to maps or wanting to go back and re-read something for clarity. Kindle is not necessarily reader friendly anyway when it comes to going back to read something. 4000 pages crammed into one file makes that pretty much impossible.<br /><br />Sure, you can use the table of contents to go to a particular chapter, but then you have to know which chapter corresponds with which; the chapter headings within the book are by name, not by number.<br /><br />So, even though you save money by having all the Kindle files in one, it can be difficult to navigate through, and with as many characters Martin has in his books, being able to go through and re-read is kinda necessary at times.<br /><br />So, five stars for the actual content of the series. I'm so very riveted that I have read through all of these within a couple of weeks. But two stars for the difficulty of four books in one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|EWY was a great read. I love the story of Eva and Gideon (how could you not like Gideon?!) This book isn't as &#34;intense&#34; as the first two books in the series, but still a fantastic book and it allows us to watch Eva and Gideon really put in the work and effort needed in a relationship. I'm certainly looking forward to the next installment of the Crossfire series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book my teacher started reading to us but could not finish .So I got the book and read it . It was so good , I cried , and I laughed . It is a very good book

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So Good.  Worth the wait.  Hopefully the wait for the next won't be as long, but I'm sure that will be worth it too.<br />I'm kinda sad to be reading the reviews.  I read a lot, I'm mean a ton... One of my favorite series is the In Death series bt J.D. Robb.  It's onto book like 43, and I could read 43 more, I'm that invested with the characters.  And yes the crossfire series doesn't have the endless possible homicide background stories to prob keep it going even half that long, I am just as invested in these characters.  I realize there has been some bad moments in the publishing of EWY, but I don't feel like the decision to stretch the story for 2 more books is just a greedy move on the side of the author and publisher.  I really think there is just more of a story to tell about these characters and all the secondary characters who have come into their lives, just like all the secondary characters that have enriched the \\"in death\\" series.  Bring it On Sylvia, I'll keep reading and enjoying where ever you take this story no matter how long it stretches out.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was a great story. I had a thought of what happened but I was wrong and I, glad.<br /><br />I love that this series is not like another author's Carpathian novels; this series tells a story. There is something happening overall, not just romance of two people meeting. There is an end goal that we all want to see: the end of silence.<br /><br />Write on, Nahlini, write on.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|great show.  entertaining.  dramatic.  relatively realistic.  the characters are great, and the acting is great.  other shows are not as good.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|Although there is skepticism with this book, I think the overall story was amazingly told. I was very interested on what James would say or do next. I could hardly put the book down. Not too sure if I'll read the sequel because I feel like I was left with a good perception of James and anything more could alter my opinion. I'm content with the ending.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Great story. She is always good in all her movies but this<br />is one of her best. I loved it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Not sure why I waited so long to watch this movie but I loved it.  Not what I expected it to be but I can say it is one I would watch again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I love this series and ca hardly wait for season 4! It took a couple of episodes to get into it but now we're hooked!
B007WFTFG6|1.0|I got this for  my 2 year old grandchild. The boxes of color are to small for a child to chose. Also the color choices should be fewer in number for the younger age group. I wish I could have been able to demo the item before purchase. I would like a way to un-buy an app. I guess just send it to my cloud.

B0001US62I|5.0|This movie endures over the years for being a well made, thrill a minute movie.  Beautifully crafted and brilliantly directed and acted.  We loved it -- again.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|I got this on one of Amazons free app days.  I Love it.  My 7 year old loves it. even the 2 year old tries to figure it out.  Get fun.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I SOOOOO love this series but this book has left me...with an unpleasant aftertaste. The ending is just disrespectful. Im sorry. Its like turning your back on someone mid-sentence. Just rude.<br />My gods the sex. Really awesome well written sex but GEEZZZ!! I needed a little more substance. Did the book even cover a whole week?<br />*Slight spoilers<br /><br />I felt the dads reaction was just glossed over. He just found out the horrific stuff that happened to his only child and a hug, a few tears, sex and workout make it alright? I got more details/insight on the new car. I felt left out of something important.<br /><br />I dont get what happens to Eva when it comes to Brett that she suddenly becomes some hoity toity PC clone of her mother. I dont begrudge her attraction to him but any other time she has enough sense and decency to not encourage it. When Gideon told her he wanted to be inside her she had an outraged hissy fit but Brett does it AFTER you tell him you love another and you dont want to hurt his feeling???!! WTH??<br /><br />Cary, my love!?? I dont even know what happened but he totally jumped the shark. For the first time he was completely pointless to me....though Im sure he will be one of the ones who help screw things up next book. Still I didnt care about anything he did or anything that happened to him.<br />Im glad there will be another book. I dont think she could tie it up in just the 3. After reading this book I think its obvious she dismantled it to start anew. This book was greatsex, awesomesex, slapyomamasex, plot, beautifulsex, goingtohellsex, clues for the next book...microscopic plot,door slam. Not that SD isnt a fantastic writer. Several times I was just blown away with her flow but... I dont see how this makes it 2 more books honestly. This seems like blatant distortion. The story is done and they are looking for fillers to make it last longer. Im still hooked and Im still all in. Im curious about the \\"necklace\\" and what the reporter is gonna do...but I do feel a little manipulated....or a lot.is gonna do...but I do feel a little manipulated....or a lot.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not difficult, good graphics. I would play again. Searches were easy to find. I did not want to stop playing.  You will enjoy.
0060594896|5.0|I have gotten so much useful information in this book that I have been able to apply to my life right away.  I read it out loud to my husband. He has attended Landmark and considers this book a complement to that. Glad I purchased it!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have not viewed the movies yet due to outside circumstances. Will advise you at a later time on this issue.
B002WY65W4|4.0|It was a good movie and disk works.<br /><br />Only thing I dont like is it comes with an expired digital copy. Cant really complain for the price but I dislike the restrictions and such they place on digital copies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book.  It is trite to say, but I can't resist.  It was magical. When the screenplay that was  developed of this book hits the theatre it will have been a supreme challenge of the writer's skills, but if it has been done well, this could potentially be an amazing theatre experience. Regarding the book this is as close as literature comes to creating virtual reality in the reader's mind. Everyone I have spoken to who has read it thus far can taste the caramel coating popcorn, smell the smoke in their nostrils and feel the hollow feeling of loss when the circus is gone.  I am not a fan of a conventional circus but I want to stroll through this one in my dreams.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Every teenager should watch this movie.  Ferris is smoooooth and popular and gets away with whatever he wants, even skipping school.  This movie is still great today, we watched it with my 17 year old son the other day and he thought it was great.  It stands the test of time, a classic.
0062059963|5.0|The Selection was pure candy for me and The Elite was its darker, richer cousin. The Elite still had its fluffy romantic moments but Cass delved deeper into the world where such things as the Selection are necessary. The Elite had much more world builder that I never realized The Selection lacked. There is not only more information about the caste system but more about foreign lands, as well as their problems or successes.  On top of this information there is also a great look into what life is like being a royal (and I will tell you it is not all pretty dresses and tasty food). America and the other Elite get put to the test not only to prove they are worthy of Maxon's love but being called a princess.<br /><br />I read multiple reviews and saw that many people had a problem with America's character in this book because they felt she was not as strong as she was in The Selection. I agree and disagree with this. America only bothered me when she would get wrapped up in being with one of the boys and then completely forget about the other. She has a problem with trusting Maxon. He would constantly tell her to trust him and the next second she would be upset with a choice he made. This would then push her towards Aspen and thus love triangle. Other than that I felt she was a strong, fierce character who stood up for what she believed in and stayed true to herself. Yes she has her flaws but what character doesn't?<br /><br />This is one love triangle that I love! At this point in the series I trust America (and Cass) to pick correctly in the end. In my eyes there is not a wrong choice. That being said I am still totally team Maxon. First off he is a prince and secondly he is just a good guy. I will say there was one scene in particular between him another member of the Elite that upset me though. Oh Maxon why can't you be real!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|WOW I really an not sure how to feel. When I started the booking thinking it was the last in the trilogy I was kinda disappointed because I didn't want it to end. I wanted to be able to keep going and we get to yet I don't really like how it ended and really hate that I have to wait until who knows when to read the next book. I still loved the book and could not stop reading it yet feel disappointed in some ways. Several things were very expected and not left to surprise. About half way to 3 quarters of the way through it I kinda figured this was not the last book as I originally had thought it was. Despite all this I will still buy the next one and can't wait to finish the series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the 30-Day Shred in February and have been using it to work out for the past 4 months. I have lost 7 pounds, which may not sound like much, but it is to me. Rather than doing the video series for just 30 days, I chose to do each level workout for one month. Workout one equaled sore arms, Jello-y legs and a feeling of accomplishment. I ended up doing the first workout for about 45 days before moving up to workout two.<br /><br />Once I started doing workout two, I felt like I hit a wall of motivation. I hated the workout. Not that it was so challenging that I couldn't do it- more like I just hated the workout. I found that I was sleeping through my workouts or finding any excuse to do a different workout.<br /><br />Then I decided to move on to level three. I'm so happy I did. The workout is so much more enjoyable to me. I love waking up in the morning and doing my workout. I see a six pack under a little layer of fluff (though admittedly much smaller layer of fluff than before). I'm much happier with my body now. I have some seriously strong legs and arms... and back... and stomach... and butt. There's really not a part of my body that isn't better toned now.<br /><br />It's worth it. Just put in the time. You'll see results.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Written in traditional chapters unlike her other works.  The reader gets a good look into the mind of Camille an  others through her observations.  Would have liked a little more background on when and how Camille left for Chicago and her relationship evolution with Amma.  I also appreciated the respectful way Flynn treated Camilles disorder.
B00CK8CLFW|5.0|I've never sculpted humans before until I bought this book.  This book provides step by step process - from start to finish and it is FANTASTIC!  I can't rave enough.  Even my son who is my harshest critic said my first model looked pretty good.  It provides suggestions for different ethnic groups as well as variations in body build.  The book indicates the amount of clay to use as well as the proportions.  The butterfly wing is also awesome.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|While I enjoyed Karl Urban's performance as Dredd, I found the storyline to be very underwhelming.  I think this would have been a better movie if the action had taken place around the huge megacity, rather than confining it to one building.  It felt more like a sci-fi spaceship movie than one taking place on earth. I've just seen this script played out too many times.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|No gore but lots of thrill and edgy surprises!!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books.  The first book was Gold Coast and from then on, I was hooked.  This book was a page turner right from the start.  Mr. DeMille has an out loud funny sense of humor.  My husband no longer let's me read in  bed.

B008JJM88Q|3.0|An animated and computerized version of \\"20 Questions, \\"akinator\\" is a lot of fun.  There is a meter on the left side of the app that shows how certain the computer is that it knows who your character is (0% to 100%).  As you respond to questions, the meter slides up and down the scale.  If the computer's percentage drops, the animated character on the screen displays a frustrated picture (LOL).  It is amazing how the addition of artificial intelligence to this tradition game cuts down the playing time!  Once the computer knows a characteristic or trait is not relevant, it does not make the human error of guessing characters with a trait that has already been eliminated.  When the computer has a guess, a picture of the character is displayed.<br /><br />I noticed that the more famous or more recent the character, the more likely the computer will easily come up with the correct answer.  The more obscure a character, the less likely the computer will guess correctly.  Also, secondary characters were more difficult for the computer to guess than main characters.  Thinking about an obscure character in an attempt to \\"stump the app\\" made the app more fun.  ;)<br /><br />My hobby is reading, so I was able to stump the app in less than 10 tries.  The computer will guess a character, and if it's wrong, it will ask if you want to keep playing.  When you stump the app, it asks you to type in the character's name.  I entered the character's app, and then attempted to have the computer guess the character again.  The character name, but not picture came up the next time I played the character.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the list of the permissions for the app, so I've knocked one star from the rating.  The list seems a bit intrusive to me, but that is probably why the computer is able to correctly guess the character I'm thinking about so quickly most of the time.  The permissions in the app appear to use your history to narrow down the possibilities.  Hum.  Is \\"Big Brother\\" watching?  Maybe.  But the app is sold by Amazon Digital Services, so they probably know all of this information already, anyway.  Amazon's \\"Recommend for You\\" feature is fairly accurate, isn't it?  : \r\\" watching?  Maybe.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Amazon has a seven day return policy for ebook purchases. Go to Manage My Kindle. When your list of recently purchased books pops up, select the book you wish to return and choose 'action' which is located to the right of the title. A drop-down menu will appear and you can select return for refund. This was the biggest waste of ten bucks. I just want to read a book that has a satisfying conclusion, not a never-ending sequel.
1400079144|2.0|Brown is going down familiar roads once again.  While I like the Langdon character, we don't cover any interesting ground in this novel.  In Angels & Demons, the character is energetic, the history involved is compelling, and the plot is truly mysterious.  In this story, I didn't care. I found myself apathetic to the plot.  Some of the history is interesting, but not to the same level as his previous work.

My 1 star review is a review not of the film (It's incredible.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I don't know why but this series has me completely captivated in spite of the violence and how women are treated, although it is true to the times.  The characters are so compelling and the story stays true to itself, never compromising just because you love a character does mean he/she is going to live very long.  My favorite is Bran.  I love the mysticism included in this series.

I finished this in less than 15 hours. I did not need to refresh my memory at any point; she does a good job of retelling without actually regurgitating the last book. I've missed Gideon and Eva so much and was hoping my longing for a good ending would be quenched. Alas it was not. I'm sated for the moment only! I'm a little perplexed as to why the series keeps dragging out and why I'm hearing that they want to stretch it to FIVE BOOKS. That's fine...if the whole story could be as thrilling as book one and two. Book three was just that a three star read.<br /><br />I felt that after half way she was being too detailed with non important things and she really rushed over the commitment section. I was so disappointed in just that. It's also starting to pile on too much drama, really it's getting ridiculous. I am really rooting for you Sylvia. You can deliver another stellar book, but please let that be it. They are so close to a happy ending. Don't mess that up for your fans, please!<br /><br />After thinking on this overnight I believe Sylvia intended a three part series because you can tell where mundane things get wordy and descriptive and important things get short..I think it's working up to a great ending but just how long we have to wait is the question.<br /><br />Sylvia don't get discouraged. You can redeem this ending, I know it. Best of luck & I wait anxiously till the next book.
B00AEFZ8OY|4.0|Funny funny stuff! If you have a great sense of humor you may just enjoy this! Try it you might like it!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Every time I start reading I leave my world and enter the world of the Game of Thrones.  It is very hard to put down once I start.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|This movie is about a post apocalyptic zombie that befriends a young attractive female and the relationship that follows.  The movie moves at a snails pace and aside from a few short scenes, nothing exciting happens.  My fiance and I turned it off after the first 20 minutes and when I finally went back and finished it later that night, I found it didn't get any better.  The lead zombie talks to the lead actress throughout the movie in a garbled half zombie half human voice that becomes incredibly annoying after the first 20 minutes.  Subtle attempts at humor are found throughout the movie, but I found the humor to be recycled by satirical zombie movies that came before. If you're really bored, I still wouldn't watch it.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Who does not love Forrest Gump!!!  One of the best movies of all time and really shows a lot of historical events that occurred in history.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Angry Birds or Bad Piggies - what's not to like? Fun creative funny and entertaining. A great way to use up free time!
B00364K6YW|5.0|My wife and I enjoy this version more than the more recent version because it's true to the book. It's much longer and the people aren't as attractive, but maybe that's on purpose too. :) I'd recommend it to anyone that liked the book.
B006OB3K56|3.0|Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan are both very good in this movie. In a fashion point of view, how the movie is made feels stylishly complicated,current and intense.
B006S053K8|5.0|In a genre which is stocked with terrible, unrealistic, stupid movies, this one really stands out to me.  The actors are natural and believable, there is good balance between comedy and drama, it is well written and edited.  I definitely recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love puzzles this one keeps things interesting and makes one think sometimes I have to turn it on around to see the pattern.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Our son read this in school and wanted to watch the movie.  We've watched this now twice in the first week. Good movie.
0316056898|5.0|Tina Fey is a comedic superhero. She's funny, she's human, she's like your funny best friend from college. This book gives such great insight into her world and her career, it makes you cheer for her and want her to really succeed in everything she does.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I loved the first 15 minutes or so of this movie, a beautiful love story told in a touching way.  Then it turned into a typical &#34;good guys vs. bad guys&#34; movie and it lost me.  Hollywood, it's ok to make a movie that is just sweet and kind!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and entertaining. A good way to while away time in a long line or waiting at the doctors office. Love the sound effects!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was hands down the best book i have ever read. It was well-written and full of imagery. The beginning instantly hooked me, and the ending brought be to tears. I was never a fan of alternate history but this book changed my opinion. Perfect combination of love, history, fact and fiction. Bravo Stephen King.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|....and so is this combo box!  An amazing treasure of 'favorite things' for any fan of The Sound of Music.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Talk about all out war which is a fitting end to this great book series. Just wish they had finished it differently. Seems like they rushed the end. Glad that someone was able to draw it to some sort of conclusion since I have read this series over and over again when a new book would come out.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book, together with the first one of the trilogy ( The Fall of Giants), is one of the best I've read in a long time. I am waiting with great expectations for the third one.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I think this is my favorite film by Scorcese. Incredible performances by the whole cast. Enjoyable from top to bottom.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I like the way it has to be build, hope this becomes more popular and put more and different models on the market, as a lego buyer and builder, money well spent
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this one!! Having it from Drew's pov was so refreshing. This one is going in my top 5 of 2013. Can't wait for the next one! Would love to give it an extra star or two.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I enjoy playing this app prior to falling asleep in the evening. it also helps the dogs relax at bedtime.
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|Samsara is a follow up movie to Baraka (also highly recommend) that caputures video from over 140 different countries and is free from dialogue. Just beautiful scenes and images set to music. It's amazing and awe inspiring and looks amazing in HD.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I had preordered and wanted this book as soon as it came out. I wish I could give a 3.5. It is not a bad book. It just seemed to be heavy on sex and weak on plot.  This book also left a cliff hanger, but I am not as eager for book number four to come out.
147674355X|5.0|Fantastic! A seriously great book filled with surprises! It's a must read!!! Colleen Hoover's writing is incredible. You won't be able to put the book down once you start.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Well-written, gets your attention from the first page. Thought I had it figured out in the first two chapters, but wasn't ready for the ending! Excellent read!
193700788X|5.0|I have loved this series for many years. I have always and will continue to highly recommend this series to anyone. This was the perfect ending to the life and characters that surround Sookie Stackhouse. I will miss all the people in these books but luckily we have True Blood. This is a series that I will re-read over and over again. I don't want to give any spoilers away so I will only say that I could not have come up with a better ending. My only wish is that there was a little more interaction with Bill. Special thank you to Charlaine Harris... Thank you for creating these dynamic characters.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game keeps me entertained for hours with all the battles and expanding base is easy to loose track of time lol
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I used the free version of this app on my Kindle Fire HD for a few days first. The developer is very generous in allowing so many features on the free version. The app is excellent. I bought the pro version to support this developer, and show him I appreciate his time and effort to give us such a great app at such a reasonable price. Worth every penny!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing!!!!!<br /><br />I liked it when they got into the games.<br />I recommend this book to all people.<br />I chose this rating because the book was amazing.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|FallenTree brought this game to a new level with the addition of jewel searches and hidden levels.  The original Quell was the first app I ever purchased and I loved it.  The love continued with Quell Reflect.  Fallen Tree then one-upped themselves, combining the traditional Quell game play with new searches (jewels, levels).  The game itself is beautiful and the music is soothing.  If you're a fan of puzzle solving, you will be a fan of this game!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I love it. I really love it.<br /><br />The quality of sound is perfect.<br />The Volume sometimes is too loud so I need to decrease the volume.<br />I haven't charged it yet since I receive it and it is still working very well for 1 month.<br /><br />I like as it is on magnet, so when you need you can easily remove it.<br /><br />It is completely worth to the last penny that I paid for it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Was not was I expected. No story and really what a ending.  The There was none The book did not have any ending.  And really Eva and Brett  and how is Corrigan pregant for 4 months and does not know it.  The story seems like it was written in a hurry and grabbing at straws.  Not buying the next one.<br />Disappointing !!!!!!!  This was not expected as a trilogy u would assume this is the last boom. Don't buy it
0425263924|1.0|I woke up this morning like many of you eagerly awaiting the latest installment of Eva and Gideon on my Kindle.  I was planning to start reading this evening and started looking at the reviews as I always do prior to opening my new present.  Immediately I was disappointed as to what I was seeing and decided I no longer had any desire to read another sequel to what was originally supposed to be a trilogy.<br /><br />I am deeply disappointed in Ms. Day for doing this to her fans and no intention of ever purchasing one of her books in future.  She ultimately did not end up getting this $10 and I stand firmly behind my decision.  I know I will put this money to some good use and possibly  purchase two or three for the price of one.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I love history and especially of the WWII era, it was a good movie, the characters in the movie and the reality of flying in those planes were well portrayed. great movie.
B0000549B0|5.0|Watching Jimmy Stewart as Harvey is an annual event each Spring for our family. Such a brilliant, fun, and classic film.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Excellent, I wasn't able to put it down. As always Nalini Singh has written a great story. I was wondering in previous books if she could write another psy/channeling without story going stale. She sure did. I will read it again soon. Loved it. Can't wait for next one.
B00CEJ2ATO|5.0|I will not sit here and tell you a super long review about how much ive followed this band and comparisons. What i will tell you is Megadeth has always been my favorite band and i was buying the cd anyway no matter what to support these artist. This album is very SOLID, not Speedy, not Thrashy, and by all means not Slow. He has experimented with his music before and hell do it again. Its one of those you put in and it has to grow on you, if you like the band, their music, their style, and most improtantly their musical talent, You Will Buy This Album!! If not then join all the other negative and hateful reviews just because you excpected Killing, Peace Sells, or Rust. I wont lie cause i expected that too, but those days are over and he can still play that material like nothing...
B009R659L8|4.0|An interesting plot twist that was completely unsuspected!  One of Mary Higgins Clark's best novels to date! Worth the read!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me.  I was impressed right away with Joyce's craft of writing.  Her imagery and beautiful descriptions were superb.  Then, I got captured by the story.  This developed into a real page turner.  I finished it within a few days.  I look forward to reading future books by Rachel Joyce.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I downloaded this app while I was waiting at the airport and it was fun for a little while and it helped kill a bit of time.  The levels were pretty easy and it didn't take long to figure out how to connect the dots.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Please see title, pretty much sums it up. This minimum word nonsense is do annoying I'd like to kick the asa that decided to require it. Sheesh!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Spending so much on lenses for your camera is tough for anyone. Having these protective caps available to put on those lenses just makes sense. Eliminates scratches and dust. Worth the money anytime, everytime.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm obviously in the minority in that I really enjoyed this book!  I didn't pick up the series until I a few days ago & have finished all three in three days!  Its an easy read & a step out of reality for most. (Including me).  Sylvia Day you are not a sellout!  Keep the storylines going!  I hope book number 4 doesn't take to long to come out.  My inner gossip needs to know where Megumi is?  will Cary find happiness?  will Brett go away for good?  will Eva & Gideon live happily ever after........& Corinne-I just hate her!!!<br />HURRY UP!!!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I came across this and figured I would watch it and I got sucked in and marathoned both seasons in a few days.  The seasons are short (only 10 episodes) but they pack a lot of story into that short amount of time.  I did find myself making a lot of comparisons to Battlestar Galactica - ragtag group of surivivors fighting back against a superior force - but Falling Skies is a travelling band so that makes it a bit more interesting.  All of the fighting isn't in a static location.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick show to fill some summer hours then I would recommend this.
B005OAQE4M|5.0|Comprehensive of much of Lincoln's life.  Learned much about Lincoln I didn't know.  Interesting, entertaining, detailed about those things that are important.
B003V9OCS8|4.0|story worth telling and watching.  did not find the romance distracting; it's a movie, not a biographic documentary.  anyway, more bromance than romance.
0439023491|5.0|I'm a rookie.  I am not really rating an Amazon product, but the quality of a book.  I thought that the book was excellent, well written, and exciting.  I look forward to the movie because of it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like using the Pinterest app on my Kindle.  It's easy to use and the images come up the same way they do on the website.  My only complaint is that I can only see pins from people I follow - unless there is an option to see everything and I just haven't found it.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Go Arnold! Another kick-ass while laughing movie! This acting adventure keeps you thrilled and smiling! Arnold may be old, but he ain't dead yet!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|not a bad way to spend a lazy day.  love the capturing quests.  great graphics as well!  five stars indeed.
0743572750|5.0|Love this series! Could not put it down!! Was hooked on the first book the second book left me chomping at the bits for the 3rd book.
B00BIPCY14|4.0|I recently got hooked on the newest season and wanted to see where it all began.  The procedural aspect can be a bit frustrating at times because I really want to know what's going on with the characters not the cases.  The guest stars are great and there are moments of humor that really break things up.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I'm hooked!! This was so much fun - waiting for the next levels to come out. My son loved it too!!
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I have had an issue with app not showing the notebook setttings... I can't change the page color or fonts. I like the app and will keep using it but would like to have the ability to change these settings. Otherwise, it's a wonderful app and I like being able to sort the different notebooks.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This was one unlikely reunion if ever there was one, but to The Beach Boys' credit they didn't just embark upon a tour to cash in on the need for nostalgia like so many other old bands. Instead the reunited group justified their further existence by recording an album that's far superior to any other album they'd released since the late '60s/early'70s and hereby made one of the most gratifying comebacks of any band in music history. Not only was \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" a creative success, the album also did extremely well commercially, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Album Chart and securing The Beach Boys their first Top Ten album since 1965. Not bad for a group of old pros in their 70s.<br /><br />Even though \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" isn't without its weaknessess (\\"Spring Vacation\\", \\"Beaches In Mind\\"), overall The Beach Boys' 29th album is an accomplished achievement containing some truly fine and affecting songs that should bring a tear to the eyes of any longtime fan of the band. These songs are \\"Think About The Days\\", \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\", \\"Strange World\\", \\"From There To Back Again\\", \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\", and \\"Summer's Gone\\". And these are just the highlights on the album. If they never record another album together, I'm glad that their final album is one of such high quality. For me personally, the final four tracks (\\"Strange World\\", \\"From There To Back Again\\", \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\", \\"Summer's Gone\\") are the strongest compositions Brian Wilson has written since 1988's \\"Love And Mercy\\".

0670026557|5.0|Good, practical advice for a better life and a better world. If everyone were \\"otherish givers\\" the world would be a better place. I wonder, though, would everyone be successful or is life graded on a giant bell-curve?
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Demick is a great story-teller. Clear, compassionate, unblinking look at the human spirit under oppression. This should be required reading in American high schools.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|I have been a Megadeth fan since the beginning and love a very large percentage of their catalog, but this is actually the worst thing I have ever heard ! Has Black Sabbath heard Megadeth version of \\"Children of the grave\\" yet? It is called \\"Kingmaker\\" on this disc.<br />Just when Megadeth had the opportunity to really make a super heavy Metal CD and show they are still strong.. They turn around and make a disc worse than \\"Risk\\". This is an  extremely disappointing CD.. I am still amazed at just how bad this CD is.. Pure garbage !
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|The only good thing about AGDTDH was Yuliya Snigir. Bruce Willis played an idiot. Jai Courtney, who was killed in Spartacus, should have taken a lesson and died early in the film. Poorly written with plot holes the size of Jupiter, the movie plodded along from one idiotic action scene to another that failed to serve the missing storyline. At the end, I waited for what was going to come next. A total waste of time.<br /><br />However, Yuliya, if you are reading this, I am prepared to grant you permanent asylum. Please contact me at once for details.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The premise for this book is awesome.  I have a friend who tried the 5-2 method of healthy living and found it easy. It just makes so much sense to eat what you want most of the time and take a couple of days off to cool your jets.  After trying this for a few weeks, I am in the process of getting test results from my annual check up and all my stats are amazing - I am 70 and the doctor says my vitals look like those of a very active 40 year old.
B000I9U75G|5.0|Gotta love the good old days... :)  Excellent quality!  Could not be any more pleased with the quality of the movie.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This game looks exactly like the old arcade game, but my 4 & 6 year olds love it.  Not the easiest control, but just as hard of a game now as it was when I was a kid.
1400052181|5.0|Very interesting. Rebecca is a great writer. She made is simple enough for us non medical people to understand what happened to the cells.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|this game is a MUST HAVE!!!!! its totally worth the money and stays fun. I recommend this game to every one!!! :) graphics and music is AWSOME!!!! go gnomey!!!
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I had heard that this was a Bluesman that spread himself thin on his debut album by playing all sorts of genres. Well, if you can do it, you might as well do it. This guy moves from blues to R&B like it's nothing, and the music on both ends are fantastic! I was pleasantly surprised by the music on this album. I highly recommend!
B00BEOYPCK|5.0|This is one of the best records I have heard, it is constantly being played on our record player! I would definitly recommend!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it - it created a deeper understanding of both Eva and Gideon, with another two books to go, I feel we will need this to move forward.<br /><br />The way they interact and wotk together is what I would like in any relationship I had.  Yeah they is still lots and more going on around them, but it works
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I read to the end. Would not recommend it to anyone. My daughter felt the same way.
B00CAJDUX8|3.0|I listen to all sorts of music and I find much of this cd as throw away fun pop.  I got the clean version of this cd, but they still add words that I consider bad words (i.e. S***) on it. Buyer beware.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|best MC game in the series<br />I really liked the gameplay in the campaign but, it could have been better. the multiplayer was awesome because it was just all out fun!!!!!
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|Three days of the Condor is a movie that I saw with my father a long time ago.  Upon finding it on Blu ray, I knew I had to have it.  If you are a fan of spy thrillers or like Robert Redford, this movie is for you.  Don't pass this one up!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill Climb Racing is a great game that will have you hooked before you know it.  It is a very addicting and will have you playing for hours.  You will find yourself trying to balance a combination of speed and technique.  I am so glad this became available on the Kindle Fire.  Myself and my two kids are playing this game to see how far we can go on each level.<br />This is a must download Game!
B00A12VJZM|3.0|You can't go wrong with 50 of the Stones classic hits. To me when you are looking at a collection like this, it is more about how it flows/ plays. I thought 40 Licks was put together nicely so that it was easy to listen to from beginning to end. This collection I can't say the same about.  It seems disjointed, which is easy to do when you are lifting tracks from a 50 year career. I was also disappointed at the omissions on this release. If you don't have these songs already, you just can't go wrong. If you are looking for a better collection ( minus 10 songs though) I recommend 40 Licks.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was like tons of readers looking for the literary orgasm that is the Crossfire trilogy, but luckily I found out beforehand that there will be a  book four and five but I'm kind of pi$$ed  there has to be!  We all know that Gideon and Eva are young and trying to find themselves  but I feel like there is only so much drama and dramatic animalistic orgasm two people can have. Lol. I remember young new love  and how much time is spent making love but this literally all this book posses. There's no real plot which sucked because I waited so long to read it. I was disappointed.
B00821PCJS|4.0|good show a little dark but interesting and a good escape from reality<br />would recommend fairly highly will she how the characters progress as to whether I will stick with it
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Load but gets technical error after pressing PLAY. Works OK on Galaxy S3 phone. It does take lots of questions to come up with correct answer.
B000VZO2SU|5.0|This album doesn't stop from the first track to the last you are caught in the Godfather's Jungle Groove.  A must for any music fan!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So many twists & turns. Wonder what Carl is going to do next...  Can't wait for the new season to start!!!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I was very grateful to have this app when the lights went out one night.. I just turned my Kindle Fire on and hit the app and I was able to find the candles
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Like everyone else, I was dying to get my hands on the 3rd book.  I was waiting for my HEA with Gideon & Eva, for months.  And then a few months ago I saw Ms. Day's update that she was planning on a 4th book (now into a 5th).  My reaction - ecstatic.  Not only are we hopefully going to get a TV Series on this (My hope is Showtime), but we get more Gideon.  Now, she could have rushed the end - she could have packed the last 20 pages with nothing but a dash to a HEA.  Which would have prompted everyone to complain about the 'rushed ending'.  A rating for a book should be based on the book itself, not being upset that the author is extending the series.  If you disliked the book fine, but if you are upset over the business side of things - that just seems to be a bit childish thing to do. Now on to the book.<br /><br />I fell in love with these two throughout the first and second book.  Book 3 was not a let down for me at all.  The sexual chemistry between these two was off the charts; hotter than ever before.  They seem a bit more emotionally connected, both having to endure being apart and so you get to see a bit of a more sensitive side to Gideon - but the alpha possessive caveman in him lives on.<br /><br />We also get to see a bit more into Gideon's past - we have assumptions based on what Eva discovered; but Gideon does open up a bit.  Along with some added drama with Nathan, even gone - he is still causing trouble for Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />The span of the book is just a few weeks - so we can't honestly expect a HEA to occur after all the drama in book 2.  I applaud Ms. Day for deciding to not rush the ending.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva show some maturity as well - working through their issues and actually talking to one another, honestly (unlike every other fictional character).  The way the story is put together; slow - follows the progression of their relationship forming again.  A lot of things occurred in book 2, so there are issues to work through and they take their time to work through them.<br /><br />I adored this book and loved seeing a slightly different side to Gideon and Eva.  I expect installment 4 to be the one packed with drama and angst and then 5 to be our full HEA story.  Be your own judge on the book.hey take their time to work through them.<br /><br />I adored this book and loved seeing a slightly different side to Gideon and Eva.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|I sam Tegan and Sara open up for The Black Keys and I really like their music. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that their music was as good on the album as it was live.  I have gone through stretches where I listen to this album two and three times in a row. Good stuff!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I absolutely love Merlin! It came promptly and I can't be happier with this purchase! Merlin is such a great show and I just love it!
1432794426|5.0|I have both books written by Karen and I love them. I got much more info about MJ than I expected to get and I am thrilled over that. If she write another book about MJ I would buy it for sure. I bought one from Amazone and one from the author herself. MJ fan you must buy it. It's worth your money.
B003TOR4EE|5.0|The complete series was a artfully written and well directed show.  Season three shows Betty getting more savvy about the ways of Mode magazine and how to get ahead in her job.  Love this show!!!!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I can't get enough of it. I was pleasantly surprised.  I could have bought her first album for next to nothing but I past on the opportunity. Amazon was offering Paradise for next to nothing and I jumped on it this time, and I am glad I did. Now I have to buy Born to Die...Dang it!!!
B001P9KR94|5.0|I resisted watching this movie for a long time despite its Academy Award Winning pedigree. When I finally did capitulate I discovered a very fine film, valuable for more than just its beautiful cinemaphotagraphy of India. From the stifling heat and grinding poverty to the neon lit opulence of modern day (Bombay); after watching this film I almost felt like I had taken a tour of the country.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, I found the female star to be a darkly beautiful gem worthy of pining for; the lead actors charismatic enough to draw the audiences's alliegiance at every age of the protagonist.<br /><br />The movie is hard to watch sometimes because of the criminal underground's exploitation of children. However, real life isn't always pretty and this topic is worth visiting.<br /><br />_'Slumdog Millionaire'_ is not the type of film I would normally pursue.  But this is one HECK of a film. I found this truly worthy of its Academy Award accreditation. Purchase this film and you will not be sorry.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you like the series then you will love this book...I think it is the best so far. The bond between Gideon and Eva is solidified by trust and emotional growth, but also this book is hotter and more 'primal' than the others.<br /><br />Sylvia does great job at creating interesting characters, vividly describing the scenes, capturing the frenetic energy of NYC, and building anticipation in all things!!! ;)<br /><br />This is a satisfying read, you feel like G & E are in a good place at the end even though there is definitely foreshadowing as a prelude to book 4. There is not a major cliffhanger that leaves you speechless and in disbelief, which is good because my heart hates that very much.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent read.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This light is very bright and convent I also like the different colors.  Very good product to have handy when needed.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|I really enjoyed their most recent work. I think it is more solid than their last effort Spirit Chaser, which was a very good album. DCD never disappoints!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading all of Kate Morton's books, she really takes us on an incredible journey through generations.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not much to complain about since it was free, it just gets tedious at some points, I also hate waiting to play.
B00BLRXDTQ|3.0|So, the Mad Max Trilogy, are easily some of the my favorite movies ever!<br /><br />This boxset is unfortunately quite lackluster.  The Road Warrior has already been released, back in 2007 and is basically identical to the new release, with the only difference, being a slight minimal increase in bitrate.  in Mad Max is basically a reissue of the blue ray release from a few months ago, with new packaging.  It is nice to finally have Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome on Blu Ray, but it has zero special features. A making of movie, or at least some production/press photos included would have been nice.  Nothing.....  If you don't already own the movies on blu ray then yes, pick this collection up.  If you do already have the first two movies, save yourself 20 dollars and just buy Thunderdome by itself for 13 dollars to complete your collection.  You would think Warner would have stepped up, and release a collection, that reflects the legendary vision of George Miller.<br /><br />All I can hope is that when Fury Road comes out, they will finally release an ultimate collection, full of bonuses for the most dedicated fans!  These movies deserve more!
B005G26NJE|5.0|I had heard much about Gary Clark Jr before purchasing his debut release. Some were disappointed at the R&B that rubs shoulders with his bluesier stuff.  To be honest, it works for me.  This guy is a real artist that can slide from genre to genre without a hitch. He is the real deal! This EP gives you a taste of what you will get on the full length album. Great stuff!
B00003XAVA|5.0|Another great cd featuring David  & Graham's vocal harmonies! Great cd! Another favorite in my collection of their music.Thanks alot!
B00BFBBN3G|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it.  I plan to read the book, and would like to see the movie again.  I will share this movie with my family and friends.  I am sure they will enjoy it, too!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed the story and learning about a part of history of which I had been unaware.  Worth the read.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|For those who have trouble sleeping, get this app. I highly recommend it. When I have a hard or stressful day, I just use this app when I want to fall asleep and fall into a relaxing sleep. It has way more sounds then the free version and it's way better. Get this app!!!!
B0036S4CTS|2.0|I really wasn't expecting a whole lot when I picked up \\"One Day\\" at a thrift shop. The only thing I knew is that the author David Nicholls wrote a few episodes of the great \\"Rescue Me\\", and I figured I would get the book for a mere fifty cents. The price is about right, because I wouldn't pay too much more for it.<br /><br />The story is about a young couple, Dexter and Emma, who meet at a party after their college graduation. The book offers an update for every year afterwards, for twenty years, and offers an interesting glimpse at how the characters grow up. The first half of the book is very entertaining, and very well written. However, as the last half of the book approached, the quality started to decline heavily.<br /><br />Once the half-way point is reached, the characters start to get tiresome and boring. Their hijinks start to become less funny and interesting and more boorish and annoying. I understand that is kind of the point, since they are starting to hit middle-age, and people sometimes do wacky stuff. But it's not very interesting, and I found myself quite bored towards the end. The ending is also super anti-climatic, and I felt a bit deceived at the end. It felt like a total cop out. Like the author didn't really know how to end the story, so he just cut it short. Then again, most of his experience is with television writing, so that may be the reason.<br /><br />Would I recommend a purchase from Amazon. No, I would not. If you can find a copy at a thrift store, yard sale, or free...it may be worth a read if British romantic comedies are your thing. Otherwise, I don't recommend purchasing it from here.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter and found out the hard way that she upgraded levels by buying points and in doing this decreasing my bank account.  I think it is so wrong to have a game for young people do this.  Of course I know about child pass words but wanted my children to be responsible and not have to block them.  I went over not buying anything from the Amazon Store, only download free apps. But did not realize during the games they ask your child to upgrade levels and they do it because they think it is part of the game, not realizing it is actual money they are really paying out.  Now because of apps like this one I have now pass word protected the kindle from doing this.  If you do download this app, make sure you have the password protection on.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I had enjoyed the first two installments of the Clifton Chronicles and was looking forward to the concluding book.  What a waste.  Recycled plot lines from his prior books (this series and others) and a very unsatisfying ending that left the door open for yet another installment.  If indeed there is a fourth book the only way I will read it is if I check it out from the library.  It will not be pre-ordered on my Kindle like this one was.
145210655X|5.0|I love this book.  It is very cute and any Star Wars fan would enjoy it. I would also suggest &#34;Vader's Little Princess.&#34;
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I finally got around to trying Evernote and I'm glad I did. It convenient and super easy to use. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 from me is the need to purchase additional storage space. There's only so much you can save in a month, but there's no indication when my month started or ends. The additional cost is not much but there is an additional charge for more space. So I have to buy more space.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia is simply the BEST romance writer!!!! (A CROSSFIRE NOVEL) captures your innermost,(conscious or subconscious) yearnings. I personally can't wait for the conclusion of Gideon and Eva. THIS SERIES IS A MUST READ!!!!!!!
B009HNDTPO|5.0|Always watch Criminal Minds it's the best. One didn't record had to catch up for end of the season. Recommended
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I bought this DVD for someone as a gift and they loved the remake better than the original.  I would definitely recommend it.
0689835604|4.0|This was my niece's favorite book growing up.  My nephew used it after her and seemed to enjoy it as well.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I agree with Psyllee. At first, I read his warning and I didn't believe him/her and I downloaded it. So I played it like 3 times and tried going on the internet but it wouldn't work so I turned of my kindle, turned it on, deleted it and deleted it from my cloud, went on the internet and it worked. Doesn't ask for permissions but I think it carries a virus so I'm just warning u not to get it .
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Great from a great young artist that I look forward to buying many more albums if they are anything like this one. As a huge Bob Dylan fan I immediately made the connection although Bugg is a little more poppy you can see the similarities a feet album from start to finish. My favorite track I hadn't heard before my purchase was Trouble Town and I could see it being the next single.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|I Loved it-so scary.  Jump out of your seat scary!  If your like vampires and zombies, then you will like this.
0345525558|5.0|Compassion inducing story.  Enjoyed learning about flowers in a new way and I have always been passionate about flowers so I felt the deep connection on several levels.  Loved learning about the soul healing properties of flowers.  So many just don't connect to the earth anymore.  This was a challenging story to read with much reward given in the end.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Funny, funny, funny, hilarious, non stop laughter, James Caan along witjh Will Farrell make a great duo and not leave out Bob Newhart
B009MYARIK|1.0|It was boring - I thought it would never end.  I thought it would never end period.  You.ve got be kidding I didn't like it.
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|It's the king, enough said. Elvis at his finest, seeing the man backstage, just being a regular guy, showing him as a person, not just a legend.
B008ASGP3U|3.0|Nicely done. Good read.  Kept the plot and the action moving forward.  When the plot or the action faltered the characters kept my interest.  Didn't over do the descriptions of the countryside as so many British seem to want to do.  Nice and twisty plotting.  Superbly exploits the mechanics of a police procedural.  Had to mark him down for not giving the reader enough information to come to the conclusion Rebus did earlier in the book.<br /><br />Rebus is a fine character, however he does not act like someone who is as old and physically self-abusive (cigarettes and alcohol) as he is.  He should be in more physical pain and he should notice it.  He should not have the stamina he exhibits.  Still, a very interesting character for someone in his late 30's.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and exciting!!!! It's so AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! I loved the Japanease theme it was very cool!this game is SPECTACULAR!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Well rounded hidden objects game, good graphics, and story. you are a detective investing the disappearance of a young mother and thing quickly turn to the macabre. All in all good game
B000W9399S|5.0|One of my favorite authors, alongside Douglas Adams. The story is very entertaining, with characters who are a lot of fun.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|wish it would have had the F word toned down a bit but for the most part very funny... not for  a younger audience with the language and sexual context...
B003LSTK8G|5.0|So often, people who write about financial matters make a major effort to show off how intelligent and knowledgeable they are about money. Other times, writers oversimplify the subject to the point of condescension. Michael Lewis writes for people like me; curious, somewhat educated, and not in the mood to hear crusty and esoteric Wall Street cliches from crusty and obscure Wall Street caricatures. Thank you, Michael Lewis, for keeping me awake.
1878424319|5.0|Excellent book. I buy it often for friends in both English and Spanish. What else can I say, but yay!
B004FQX59I|5.0|While criticized by some, Stone did an excellent job connecting the dots in explaining this always contentious subject. This is about as close as we are going to get to the truth of the matter until the government declassifies sealed documents in 2029.
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|watched 40 minutes of it then turned it off .to confuseing for me. I thought it would be a lot better than what it was.<br /><br />bob w
B00B10HAO2|3.0|It was slow at times and overacted at others.  Not my favorite film.  Watched it on my tablet though on a cross country flight, so did make the time go faster.
B0012GMW7A|1.0|Not what I thought it would be, there was one song on this album ( Alleluia) and a frined told me that he was the author of the song so I googled and found this album thinking that I would like it.  I did not like it, any of it.  I was disappointed very much.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|If you're a fan of challenging games which involve finger to screen movement then this is your game!<br /><br />Your goal is to move a piece of candy around the screen collecting 3 stars before getting it into the little monsters mouth.  The levels start out easy by simply cutting a rope at the right time it will get all the starts and drop into his mouth.  However it soon becomes more challenging because the game adds bubbles to float your candy, spiders which will move down the rope and eat it, the stars are timed and disappear and much much more.<br /><br />The game only gets better as you play.  I also enjoy that I can play the game for 10 minutes, turn it off to do something and then come back later to play more.  It's a great game and I highly recommend it!
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|not my type of movie. thought it would be better than what it was.<br /> to each its own.<br /><br />bob w
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is sooooo addicting that you cant put it down. it has very colorful graphics that really add to the fun of playing the game. this game changes regularly and goes to different places like tokyo and Miami. it has weekly challenges and once you complete them you get a prize of something like coins. there are many different characters and hoverboards to save up for. overall this is a GREAT game. :)
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I've had this book for about four days now (some bookstores in NZ released it a tad too early) and so far of what i've read (first five chapters) Very very BORING! I am trying my hardest to keep going but it's so hard when you're not feelin it. I should have just jumped in line and waited another few months for it to become avaliable at my local library, instead of paying $19.95 at the bookstore. (And people moan cos they had to pay like $10 for it!?) Anyway, all they've done is jump eachothers bones and that's about it! And if they're not doing that, that's all Eva is thinking about. How much is too much five chapters in? I even skipped the sex scenes cos' they we're getting a little (YAWN) old. Eva.... She irritates the hell out of me! she has done so since Reflected in You. She's needy, immature, selfish, GRRRRR I could go on forever about her! She just really makes me want to slap her and then some! I seriously think Gideon is WAAAAAAAAAAYYYY..... TOO GOOD for her. Her & Brett deserve eachother! The only reason I even contemplated buying this book, after waiting what felt like 10 years & 50 pushed-back-dates later, is beacause I like Gideon as a person, and I wanted to know more about what happened to him growing up, and how his relationship is going with his sister. I hope they do form some sort of relationship beacuse Gideon needs at least one stable person in his life, and it sure aint Eva. I really hope that I'm wrong, and that the book will get better (when I feel a little more encouraged to go back to it, but for now it's at the bottom of my 'to read' list), but judging by the reviews on here so far..... Yeah nah. She should've just stuck to a trilogy and left it at that. But seriously. Eva, GRRRRR!!! that chick is just as bad as Corrine and Magdaline. Actually she's worse than Magdaline, wouldn't suprise me if her feelings for Gideon are even more genuine that Eva's. But I do think that Gideon does deserve more.. Way more than Eva. She needs to grow the hell up, and think about someone else for a change, instead of her needs and wants... Wish me luck with the rest of the book LOL!
B008OM0EDO|3.0|I started watching it and got about 1/3 of the way in.  I wasn't hooked and I thought of better things to do so I just gave up.  :-)
B00BB67UNW|4.0|it was exciting and enjoyable to watch. wasn't boreing, and I could understand the story  all the way through. I really don't 5 star anything except fror ice cream.<br /><br />bob w.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The year long wait ended in disappointment, I thought this was a trilogy. These two have more issues together than 1/2 the books I've read combined (that's a lot of books).I can't understand why this couldn't be finished up, does it have anything to do with selling more books at $10 a pop?<br /><br />That being said the story kinda dragged on and on, thank god for all the sex otherwise I may have gone mad! I wanted to love this book but it was just to hard and I can't imagine what Eva and Gideon will go through to finally be married in the public eye.<br /><br />To much for me, I returned it and won't read the next one at that price!
B005S9ELVC|4.0|again, action packed.held my interest,easy to follow.the cast was excellent,and it kept me in suspense through the whole movie.<br /><br />bob w

B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved all the Sookie books.  They are definitely rereadable, too.  Charlaine Harris is great!  After Sookie, check out Harper and Lily.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I was so disappointed to learn that they cancelled this show. It is fabulous--excellent plot, characters and actors. Love, love, love the Broadway of it all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really interesting twists and turns....loved it.  Parts were a little repetitive but it was a really interesting and fun read.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have to say that out of all the games I have played this is one of my favorites. It's game style is a lot like Diablo 3. I recommend this to anyone.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Ram mount makes a great highly dependable mount that can be used with multiple holders. I have not had any problems and enjoy the versatility.

0786958731|5.0|Bought this for my son. He is very hard to please when it comes to gifts. But he gave this one two thumbs up. Thanks!!!
B00BBW16HW|3.0|Was disappointed with the ending and finding out the differences from the real story. Other than that it was somewhat entertaining and thought provoking.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Action-packed with an intriguing storyline, this series does not dissappoint. We watched The Shield, marathon style, an entire rainy weekend.<br /><br />Did I mention it wasn't raining?
B008AYA7WE|4.0|I got this looking for a good Tetris like app for my tablet free and it's alright. It is not the revamped style that iTunes just released but its still the basic game
B002QNTNL6|5.0|This movie is very very good. Really shows how a daughter will go out of her way to be with her dad. Then showing how the dad sees his child for who they are and trying to become a good father again
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've been looking for this game for so long happy they put on amazon store I have this game on every device that I have
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Works on my Kindle: I found that it is easier than going to the website; easy to set up and use.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Read 1/3 of the book ....and I wish I can return it. Gosh, repeating sex scene and why do I come to hate the main characters? I'm not asking for a fairy tales but this story dont make sense anymore! I don't feel like finishing it.<br /><br />And no longer a Trilogy but 2 more books to come???? Am not paying a penny more for this story :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great way to get the mind and thumb working and have competition and racing with other users on the game
B0049J2BSM|5.0|THese movie is incredible pixar is a simply the best cartoon company of all time i can't believe how good this movie is hopefully they dont screw up on this new one
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|The book is as readable as any of the other Sookie Stackhouse books. A bit slow to start and everything happens towards the last third of the book. Normally I would give these books a 4 star review purely because I find the books enjoyable and a simple escape Into someone else's world. I give the final book in the series because I was disappointed with the final outcome in her relationships. I wouldn't be a huge fan of one of the characters in the book and they have a happy outcome.<br />However, I did not write the book, all I can do is go along with the story. The series over all was a pleasure to read as are most of Charllaines  book series.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I found the interwoven narratives informative and emotionally engaging.  I felt that there could have been more unwinding of the two stories at the end.  It was a little unsatisfying finally, because I found myself wanting to know just a little more.  But well written and interesting.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm so conflicted here,I LOVED Eva in this one! She was smart confident and so much more kick-ass than we've seen her before. But on the other hand there was SO much that was left hanging! All I can say is THANK GOD this isn't the last book of the series or there would be a TON of pissed off readers. All in all: I LOVED this book, and I cannot wait for the next to see what happens to my most favorite couple!
B00CW665VI|5.0|It's the kind of book I really,really like!It's funny,it's sensitive,it's very erotic...it's like watching the story happening in front of your eyes!You have all these images while reading,you find yourself laughing in several pages,you get angry with the hero in others...<br />did I mention that you read the hero's{man's}point of view???Oh yeah.....!!!!You definitely should read this one ladies!!!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I like this album alot it's fun and sassy  sound is great  wish it were longer  would like Rod to make another. Big Fan.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|great new edition from the shirley temple version...the little princess was graceful and elegant for someone her age.  wonderful movie

1616550414|5.0|I like the concept art and the retelling of all of my favorite games. Very cool and worth a buy.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, and the characters. Did not want the story to end. You will have a wonderful feeling when you finish this one. Need I say anything more,  Just read it!!!!!!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|This is my second favorite film version of Pride and Prejudice.  My first is the one with Colin Firth.  I am an avid fan and have read most of the spin off novels and have purchased all film versions.  The characters displayed in this film are more in line with my vision of Darcy and Elizabeth (not so much by facial features as by action and dialog).
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I was a little behind in finding this but a solid review led me the way.<br />Well thought drama with a sci-fi twist. I like it least when it moves into the &#34;police procedural&#34; mold but otherwise it is very intriguing well acted and basically fun and original sci-fi offering.
B0064MGU98|5.0|For someone who has just come into knowledge of this TV Series, it's great to have the quick catch-up option for the earlier seasons.  Good acting from all cast and guest stars.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|must watch series! i was sad when it reach the finale. cant wait for next season to begin, its going to have major pwnage.
B00499NHLC|5.0|After hearing about this show from a number of friends I finally sat down to watch.  I was not disappointed!  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman bring style, fun, and quick exchanges to this show.  I fell in love with it from episode 1.
B004EF65QA|5.0|But it picks up with the love interest picking up.  Now where does it go?  The inevitable is obvious, but I would love to see more.  The depressing part is where the common man has to live, the conditions they live under, and the terrible health conditions.  Still, I enjoyed the story.  Now comes the romance and business success ...or does it?
B009EEFTMC|4.0|a clever twist on matching. the 3 dimensions adds a nice difference. it would be nice if it kept track of something beyond just the highest score.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|must watch series! i was sad when it reach the finale. cant wait for next season to begin, its going to have major pwnage.
193700788X|1.0|If you absolutely must know what happens check Wikipedia or ask someone who already spent her $ carelessly.<br />Big disappointment.
B008Y73940|4.0|It was a good movie to fill in the time. It wasn't overly done, and had an good story line
B004ELSDZK|4.0|this is different than a lot of games out there, there are some twists on the idea of matching (there are both 3 and 2 matches to do) but instead of the time forced approach of most match games, this one takes thinking and planning. You will get stuck on some of the more complicated puzzles but that's the point.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I played this twice. It guessed the first one but I stumped it with the second. Of course, it asked me to enter the info about my fictional character so it could verify it. That took away the mystery. I took this as a form of data collecting for other attempts. Still, it was fun to watch how the program went through its guessing.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|great mix buy it!<br />Ten years after is a band that will go down in history<br />got to see alvin lee only once in the 7s<br />i will never forget the outstanding guitar work!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I like this game a lot. It is one of my favorites.  I play it all the time.  I recomment it to anyone who likes pop it games.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I use this with my Nexus 7 tablet and it works just as expected. As a result I no longer have to lug my laptop on vacations since I know I can connect to it and through the laptop to my corporate network if I have to access a file that is not available via emaill.
B008Y7DV70|5.0|If you like scifi movies, this is the type of movie that will suit you! The story is a little slow for some, but I thought it was fine.
B007N85POS|4.0|This game was challenging, combining luck with skill, and I found it to be a real time waster, in that once I would get started, I wouldn't have sense enough to put it down and get back to work.  Enjoyed it.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Great stuff, what else can I say. What happened to this quality of music? This truly brings back the best of the 60s.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|but that doesn't mean it's not well done. at higher levels it gets pretty hard and can be frustrating but generally it's a good time waster.
B0049OSQ18|4.0|The King is Dead is credible but not as enduring or original as The Crane Wife or The Hazards of Love.<br />I'm afraid this one is just a bit reminiscent of The Decemberists earlier works and not as refreshing as a new album.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin and Rebus, retired or not, never let you down. Suspense and the feeling for the gloomy autumnal landscape, a clear yes!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Very good, we all liked it. Definitely buy around Easter time along with HOP. Out of 2 the girls liked HOP best but this was a close second.
B009KEN87O|3.0|Not much more to it than that. just the classic shoot'em before they hit you stuff from the early days of video games.
1250004217|1.0|I read this book twice to make absolutely sure I wasn't wrong the first time, but no, it really is weak. First of all, don't compare it to Sophie's Choice. Sophie's Choice was a masterpiece. Because this is also a book about a female protagonist during WW2 doesn't make it the same. The one good thing I can say about it is that it did drive me to learn more about the experiences of Jews in occupied France, the subject matter was compelling. But the writing, plot and character development are just weak and feel incidental...like she wanted to write a whole book about Vel d'Hiv but somehow needed to introduce modern characters, which ended up being one dimensional caricatures. Also, I read The Virgin Blue by Tracey Chevalier many times, and while it has issues of its own, you would be better off reading that, as Sarah's Key is EXACTLY THE SAME BOOK.

B00AO686MY|5.0|This is a very underrated movie by most people. All though it is perhaps more on the adult side in some subject matters, for a cartoon, it is extremely entertaining and a great demonstration of how Zemeckis is a great comedy director outside of the Back to the Future series.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I caught the final episode of this show by accident. Then I read about it later on some website. I had to purchase the season. I loved Travis Fimmel and his character Ragnar!! Can't wait for Season 2!!!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud. This became so annoying to me that I now use an entirely differant music player on my phone.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is very fun but I would like to be able for u to be your favorite pony and decorate yourself and get more daily gifts like a present from princess celestia and some presents would be ponys or places and jewels or even coins I would really like it if they would update it and make it even more fun but I give this game 5 * :)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's easy, fast, precise, and I love using it. It finds things I just think about and I learn all the time.
0345529057|5.0|However good the books may be I am somewhat annoyed today! I was SO looking forward to reading that I opened the box and sat down with the first book. I opened it only to find that the print is so microscopically small that I had to come back to Amazon to buy a lighted magnifier! These book should come with either a warning to sight impaired people or they should be sold WITH a page magnifier! After I get mine I will come back and review the books!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers. My friend told me about it and now that's like the only game I play. It's addicting!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|some people might look at the game icon (with the elevator) and thin this is just another dumb clone of the popular 100floors. not so. this is a real room escape game. you have a whole room to explore(compared to the one scene). you also have a few puzzles to solve while collecting items and clues to eventually find the key to open the elevator door. this game has the perfect amount of challenge I like. NOT too easy but also NOT too challenging as to making it impossible tp play without finding a walkthrough. the game is short but hey it's free and more levels are promised to come. hope it doesn't take too long.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting MONTHS for book 3 of 3 to be published, I feel betrayed as most others have posted.  The only way I can see to let the author and publishing company know how displeased you are as a consumer is to return the book, get a refund and not purchase additional books.  We are the consumers.  Our hard earned money drives this business.  If you are unhappy return the book and get your refund.<br /><br />To get your refund go to your account.  Click on \\"manage your kindle.\\"  Select the book you want to return by clicking to the + to the left of the book title.  When the cover pops up, there will be an option to return in blue writing below and to the right.<br /><br />I am not okay with waiting months for a trilogy, then to have been baited and switched end the end.  Shame on you Ms. Day.  Shame on you Penguin Publishing.  You have just lost one loyal customer.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|great app. very easy to use and fast. Easy and quick transfer from page to page. Faster in fact than on my laptop.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Since I grew up in this era, I can relate to everything he wrote about. From the pre-thrash/tape trading era to the drug filled 90's.<br /><br />This is a good history book about one of the best music eras by one of the men responsible for creating this movement.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I enjoyed this Reacher book better than the last few. As a change, the possible love interest didn't materialize. The end came a bit abruptly. The &#34;plot against mankind&#34; that always seems to put Reacher to the test wasn't as deadly as most, if not all prior books. So why did I like it? Maybe because it wasn't quite the same old same old.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|With the exception of them over using the phrase 'This is my design', the show is well thought out and written. The actors are believable in their rolls. The episodes are quick and intense and still have the ability to bring you deeper into the story line without giving anything up.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Excellent album for Vampire Weekend fans, has a great mix of upbeat and slow songs, and fits with the same style we've come to expect.
B000KJTOMQ|5.0|This book was a terrific reading experience.  It takes a while to get into it (by that I mean the beginning is much about drinking champagne and gallivanting about Oxford- a bit of fun), but the process is entirely worth the effort.  By the time one finishes, it all makes sense.  There are also so many things to discuss- I read it for a book club; by the end I found myself underlining nearly every line.  The cast of characters compels one to continue reading, as each shares his or her particular quirks and enhances some sense of how people are both worthy and flawed.  I'm glad I read it; the themes are tremendous.  Waugh may have written this, in part, because of his own experience with a family much like the one in Brideshead.  He later commented that he wasn't sure he even liked this book- for the way he wrote it, etc.  But the style is so much indicative of the particular upper crust in that period.  If he was dismayed or disgusted by it, it must have been for the same reason we find British society both compelling and humorous.  This book isn't necessarily satirical- and I don't think it's trying to be.  Part of what makes it such an enjoyable read is how close it comes to satire without being it.  For, I believe, Waugh was capturing a vein of society that truly behaved this way.  Anyone who's spent time in England can probably attest to some of these characters' truthfulness.  Though I'm not historian, I believe this book honest- and that is part of what makes it fascinating.  There are a lot of &#34;characters&#34; in this world and this book gives you a look into their particular oddities, dynamics, and struggles.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and u get to play games to get money to get another game I play this game all the time
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|LIFE OF PI is quite simply a visual feast of spectacle.  From the Indian locations of Pondicherry in the past, to the sequences taking place at sea, a quite wonderful evocation of an uninhabited island where the plants are predatory, to the final sequence taking place in sunlit suburbia in Canada, the film is full of memorable images.  The moments involving the animals - especially Richard Parker the tiger - are equally memorable; if they have been created using CGI, they certainly did not seem so.  Director Ang Lee has a wonderful way of suggesting the animal's predatory nature, yet at the same time its straightforwardness (unlike the human characters).  At the same time, I have to admit that the plot of LIFE OF PI is slight, to say the least: one can understand the central character's desire to discover himself and his relationship to God, but the progress of moving towards self-awareness is sometimes a slow one.  The film drags on occasions; one wishes that more character-conflict had been introduced, especially involving G&eacute;rard Depardieu, who has a memorable cameo as an obstreperous ship's cook.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The Cable works a treat and I am very happy with it, would recommend it to anyone,  thank you so much.
1931382794|4.0|Hunter Allen with Andrew Coggan created this great book.<br />The book is divided in 3 parts explaning:<br />1) Theory of Powermeters<br />2) Different powermeters in the market and the use of each technology<br />3) Trainning for increase Funtional Power
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|First, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor and this is one of his finest acting performances.  However, with that being said, the movie is a plotless pointless meander into the realm of American restlessness and apathy circa 1950.  I am no puritan, but I grow weary and tired of gratuitous hollywood sex scenes and sexual innuendos that pretend to be avant-garde and original---which, unless your still pre-pubscient---is no longer shocking, but boring and unoriginal.<br /><br />Now for those who think I am being unfair in my review, please know that I love kirky, off the beaten path orginal hollywood movies.  The 1977 movie &#34;3 Women&#34; is a surreal downright bizarre movie, yet, for some reason it works and keeps you tranfixed on its dreamlike quality.  &#34;The Master&#34; however, has no such redeeming quality and resembles more of the director's take on American narcissism run amok, albiet with a postmodern twist.  By postmodern, I mean, the eschewing of any over-arching meta-narratives---which, &#34;The Master&#34; typifies with its lack of plot, point, or denouement.  Sorry, but, this kind of genre has been done to death already.  Nothing more to say, but, &#34;been there done that already&#34;---Come on Hollywood, give me something great, besides regurgitated warmed-over pop-philosophy.  I want my $4.99 back!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This review has been really hard for me to start. I am so conflicted about how I feel about this book. Ok, maybe that's not true. I think what is more true is that I don't want to have my feelings about this book taint how I feel about the series on the whole, if that makes sense.<br /><br />First of all: There has been a ton of hoopla about people being upset by the Crossfire \\"trilogy\\" suddenly becoming a 5-book series. Me? I don't really care. However, I do think that decision affected this book and probably lowered it's plot quality. I will get into that in a minute. Back to the whole 3-book vs. 5-book thing. I see why people were upset. People pre-ordered this book MONTHS ago (how long has the wait been for this book??? ) thinking it would be the end of the story for Gideon and Eva. They would get their HEA and all would be beautiful. Only to find out in many cases after they had the book that they would have to buy two more books (at a cost of $10 each) to get what they were expecting in that book. Like I said, if the books are well written and entertaining, that doesn't bother me, but I can totally see why people are pissed about it.<br /><br />On to the book itself.<br /><br />There was something missing. I can't totally put my finger on it. There were some pretty major things that happened that I felt didn't get the attention they deserved. Instead we got sex Lots and lots of sex. Don't get me wrong, I am all for sexy time. Especially with my man Gideon. But in this book, it seemed gratuitous. It felt like major plot lines were glossed over in favor of more sex. The story was missing and it seemed to reduce the relationship between Eva and Gideon to a purely sexual one. I think that did a disservice to their characters. They are more than that.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, I was majorly disappointed in Eva this go round. Honestly, it seemed like all she did was fight against Gideon and then want to screw him. She was  like a cat in heat and all she could think about what her next lay. Where was the person? She was all sex! And her decision making skills...what the hell? I wanted to shake her and tell her to wake the hell up.<br /><br />Then there were the secondary characters. Megumi seemed to come up ALL the time...but I am not sure why? What was the deal? Does she factor into a future book somehow? I never really understood why Eva was always talking about her and why there was a big deal made about what was going on with her. And Eva's parents, why did that need to happen?  There seemed to be a lot of \\"filler\\" by discussing secondary characters instead of talking about Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />There were also things that I was thoroughly confused by. On one of the major plot happenings (the one I feel was glossed over) I was never really sure who they told what to. Did Carey know? Did Eva's mother know? Who did they announce it to? I never really understood that.<br /><br />Ok, so there you have it. I am still a fan of Gideon. Less so Eva now. I was NOT happy with her in this book. Would I recommend this book? Not really. However, I would recommend the series, and this book is integral to the series, so...in a roundabout way I guess I think you need to read it if you are a crossfire series fan. Does that make sense?<br /><br />Me? I am still a fan and I will read the next book (which I am sure won't be out for a year). I really, really, really hope that it redeems the series and makes me feel better about it.ld think about what her next lay. Where was the person? She was all sex!

B004I654WQ|5.0|Great I liked it, why must I write that I liked this! I ordered it, I liked it very much for my boys
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I watched the movie without the baggage of expectations; unaware it was based upon a crime novel series.  I absolutely loved the scenery and the character of the bayou the movie portrayed.  In the comfort of your air conditioned home viewing area you can almost feel the oppressive humidity of the swamp coat your skin.  The main character is played in quintessential Tommy Lee Jones style.  No surprises there.  The rest of the characters are well cast.  The plot, obviously chopped for the movie, has some strong and some weak connections that others have mentioned in their reviews.  Although the movie brings everything together in the end, it could have been better executed.  Plot holes aside it was still worth watching for the regional color, music score, and the characters.  I'd love to see a director's cut.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Definitely not the best of the books and I had high hopes for this one. Rather disappointed with this one.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|We've always been a fan of the great Arnold S., this latest movie wasn't his best you could really see how old he's gotten. There was lots of action gun fights speeding cars , etc. What really made the movie was the comedic outburst from one of its characters, it really helped the movie along.the best fight seen came at the end and showed us all that Arnold can still kick butt!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is a great album with some wonderful songs.  I watch Nashville weekly and love being able to listen to the music from the show during the day.  If you're a fan of Nashville, then it is a must have album.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Connelly does a great job of working Harry Bosch into the Lincoln Lawyer series, and it pays off in ways to shift the perspective of the story from the lawyers view to that of the investigator. Michael Connelly remains one of my favorite authors. Now I can hardly wait to start &#34;The Drop&#34;.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This show explores the implications of medical technology on our lives with a sexy star and lots of action and intrigue. It almost seems to pull you into that world it is so believable.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Originally I didn't care to see this movie. But what a mistake that would have been. Amazing story line and beautiful cgi of wildlife, I was truly captivated by the entire movie experience. Its story of the boy Pi  grabs hold of you from the start, and with the twist at the very end will endear it to your heart.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was so excited to read this book, mostly because I was under the assumption it was the final book. I am so disappointed that there are still two more books to follow. I would never have started this series if I knew it didn't end with this book. I really enjoyed the first two books, but this one seemed lacking. Gideon called Eva 'Angel' way more than I remember him doing, and I am over Cary being undecided between Trey and Trista (Trey is obviously the better choice). Also, I felt like Eva was way more insecure about her body, especially her butt, in this one. Yes, I understand she is insecure, but she seemed a lot more preoccupied about what she was eating and exercising this time around. And even after getting married, Eva still doubts Gideon's faithfulness and love. I feel like I've been tricked into buying all these books.
B003PAXOPU|5.0|I expected to get a used copy of 300 limited edition and the ended up getting a brand new factory sealed copy awesome.....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book and all the surprises it held. I agree with others when they are saying 4 or 5 books will be to much. It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to wait 6 months to a year per book.
B000OLV97I|4.0|I originally purchased this on dvd, it was lost so repurchased it thru Amazon.  Read the book, and of course nothings as good as the book. But it is good enough, and I really enjoy storys where good triumphs over evil. I'm also a fan of Jeremy Irons he is an incredible actor, and was the best actor in this film.

B000PDYVVG|1.0|This is supposed to be a model for how to live your life? I found it shallow, narcissistic and its glorification of infidelity made me faintly queasy. The whole thing seems like an exercise in self-promotion. So let's see, how can I pull in as many disillusioned women into my readership? Well, sex, absolutely. And food--good one! But that all sounds too self-indulgent, so in between, let us search for meaning in as New-Agey a way as possible. And stick it in between food and sex in the title. Yeah, that'll sell, oh yes it will...and while I'm at it I'll dump my husband, make him a primary character, and then cut him out of the profits. Right on!

Ms. Day you missed it this time... But you are still an amazing writer and i will continue to read your books....

B000ICXQUQ|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie and this weekend we shared it with our children aged 6, 9 and 11.  They loved it too.  It captured all of us and had us routing for the hero (Kevin Costner) and wanting the field of dreams to help heal everyone.<br /><br />Fantastic, feel-good movie for the whole family.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I never cared for The World Needs A Hero, Cryptic Writings or Risk. It's been apparent for some time that Megadeth is always up for experimentation especially through most of the 90's, and even on their last album Th1rt3en. To anyone that's disappointed in the direction on this album, I say oh well. Not every album they've done in the past is a heavy mother, but even the mediocre ones have their moments. I look at Super Collider as a super diverse album that may not be perfect, but it measures up to their most recent albums, and is a hell of a lot better than the three that I mentioned in the beginning. If you want extreme thrash metal, get the latest Testament or Destruction. But if you want Megadeth, get this cd.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I found this book to be fascinating. It won't in and of itself provide a detailed plan or motivation for you to change your habits, but I think it helps gain an understanding, a framework that makes it feel as if the issue of habits is a tangible thing that have reasons for being and why they are able to be changed. The stories in book are also just downright interesting, so even from a pure enjoyment perspective, it's an easy and entertaining read. So while this book may not fully spur you to action, I think it's a great place to start.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has a great variety of sounds, melodic, nature, etc. that can be used singly or in combination. it includes a timer and is simple to use.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The characters in this story are real, they are your friends and neighbors.  The plot moves along briskly, and for me was quite suspenseful.  A beautiful story, beautifully written!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I waited soooooooooo long for this book and find out there is another book. I am very disappointed. My book club preordered the book and instead of discussing the story we were upset. I wish I hadn't started the series, this was dragged out.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Simply put, this game is great. The multiplayer is fun, fast paced, and overall good. The campaign is good, and is the next step from the Modern Combat 3 campaign. The controls for me are smooth, but of course took awhile to get used to. But you can customize the controls to make the game easier to, of course, control. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS games. 5 of 5 stars.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|always a pleasure to read Nicholas Sparks such a wonderful story, I always look for his new books<br />in inspiration
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|could not stop watching wanted to know what happened. this is hard to find in a lot of new shows
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Entwined with You the 3rd installment of the Crossfire series answered a lot of question for me. I understand that Eva and Gideon were making up for lost time with all the make up sex. There can be too much. I felt that more could be explained and with out sex every couple of pages. Once again that is just me my opinion. I really do not see why there is going to be two more books in the series. If there wasn't a sex scene every couple of pages, there might to be only one more book instead of two. Don't get me wrong, sex works, but there can be so much a reader can handle.
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|Didnt expect this movie to look good or be entertaining.<br />This movie was funny...a bit gritty with the resolutions sometimes but acceptable.

0425263924|1.0|After getting so caught-up and swept away by the characters and emotions in the first two books in this &#34;trilogy,&#34; I am now left frustrated and disappointed.  The fact that the publishing dated was delayed and pushed back numerous times  was bad enough, but then despite my excitement to finally be able to get closure and enjoy the happily-ever-after of this love story -- it left me hanging yet again with the promise of TWO more books to finish the &#34;Trilogy?!&#34;  This was supposed to bring closure and tie up all the loose ends--leave us warm and fuzzy and ready to grab the next book with new characters for us to fall in love with and connect to.  That did not happen.  The Entwined With You story line was weak and not in the same emotional intensity.  It created more loose ends and confusion.  I even questioned it it was Ms. Day writing it.  It seemed to lack her usual characteristics and the emotional connection with the characters I usually feel with her writing.<br /><br />I feel lied to and deceived by a writer that I enjoyed.  I loved escaping and drowning the world out in the few stollen moments to myself and I cherish that time.  Reading is my escape and stress reliever.  Despite the fact that I had enjoyed and highly recommended the first two books, after reading this one, I no longer can recommend any of them because I don't think I want to put a friend through the same frustration I now feel.  I am very disappointed!  My journey with Eva and Gideon ends here.  I think my emotional attachment and energy will be better spent by writing this series off.  Waiting for Ms. Day to finish the next two books in this now &#34;series&#34; --if they are anything like book three--it is not worth the anticipation excitement, my time, money or frustration.  I am very disappointed in Ms. Day for taking advantage of her loyal readers as well as the publishing company for allowing it.<br /><br />I have enjoyed Sylvia Days books until this point, however I am sadly taking Sylvia Day off my favorites list.

B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|The jumping from all the different time eras was a little confusing. In the future era where Tom hanks and Halle Berry speak some form of broken English is hard to understand. I love the choice of cast, each of them very talented. Its too bad the script gave then littler to work with. I rented this movie but would never buy it our watch it again.

Just when I thought I had it stumped it whooped me and got the answer right! I have even tried the most obscure things I can think of and it still kicks my rear!!<br /><br />I'm totally addicted.<br /><br />The best part of the game is that it's customizable. You can customize the names and pictures of your animals, friends, family, favorite characters, cartoons, etc.<br /><br />If you miss the opportunity to get it while it's free, I highly recommend that you purchase it. It'll be worth every cent and you'll get hours of enjoyment from this game!!
B0018OASZE|5.0|This album was clean and sounds good. I like the album itself and wanted it on vinyl for my new record player!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is awesome and I think everyone should play this game cuz this game is awesome and it rules
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I've been anxiously waiting for the release of this book but so horrified reading all the crappy reviews that I approached reading it with trepidation.<br /><br />I started reading it waiting for something really bad to happen. are they going to something really stupid? cheat? Make stupid irrevocable decisions? I kept reading with bathed breathe until the last page. and guess what?!!! there was NOTHING bad. In fact, it was quite GOOD and the sex was super HOT. Gideon and Eva were so sweet with each other in this book. m so happy that their relationship is getting stronger.<br /><br />So it didn't end at book 3, so what? personally, I'm quite thrilled that 2 more books are coming out. More Gideon and Eva! Yay!!!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I didnt return this because it is exactly as shown and very nice. It came with a small cut on the back side in the leather. Im not using it for anything special so decided to keep it. I would recommend, as I believe this was a fluke thing that happens rarely.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Tom Baker is who I think of when I think of Doctor Who.  However, Christopher Eccleston, and Billie Piper are awesome in their roles.  She is by far my favorite companion, and he probably does the Doctor role better than anyone.  Even better than Tom Baker (but he's got 40 years of TV acting evolution to go on).
B004UHL9EK|5.0|An extremely versatile set of clocks, alarms & timers.  And it's easy to keep them separated so you can quickly set an alarm without accidentally setting a timer instead.  Also easy to set which days for the alarm to go off.  The timer is handy for reminding when to feed the meter.  Of the several I've tried - this one was the keeper.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|This is a beautiful and epic blending of magnificent music, with great acting and rich and ambition film making.  It's the best film of an opera I have ever seen.
0425263924|2.0|What a rip off!  Like others wrote, this was supposed to be the last book in a series of three.  This whole book seems like filler with a few lame teasers so you will read the next books that you will have to wait how many months for?<br /><br />I hate to be so cynical but it seems the author is milking this cash cow just for the money. She should be ashamed but I suspect she is laughing all the way to the bank. I am over Ms Day and her books. Even the writing seems to have gotten worse.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|If your kid plays Lego batman (the newest one) he will love this. It's all the movie parts in the game put in a actual movie. If you get this and don't have the game yet it will be a treat to go get the game as well. We're gonna go buy it for sure.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game delivers a very good mahjong game with what seems like much larger game board and more rows of tiles than the others I've tried for my smart phone.
B000FZET5W|5.0|What is there to say, its 1954, its Sonny and Monk playing together with other musical giants like Art Blakey, need I say more? This is without a doubt a \\"must have\\" for anybody that considers themselves a jazz fan. Period. My only complaint is that I wish that either I would have been old enough to enjoy this recording session in person or it (along with the recording) had gone on for another hour or two. Yes it's a must have...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game, as you can tell from the title, is the BEST GAME EVER!even though it doesn't have as many things from pc, ITS STILL AWESOME!!!!- Explosive Guineapig 101

1558908846|4.0|This movie was every bit as fun as the first time I saw it. I enjoyed the ride. Worth the money.
030745455X|5.0|This book does not at all disappoint for those who read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In some ways, I found it better. This is one of those books that is not only well written with enough twists to keep you guessing, but it's one that you cannot put down--even at 3am. I found myself getting excited to go home at the end of the day just so i could figure out what would happen next. Stieg Larsson did not disappoint.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all 12 (13?) of these wonderful books.  Just love Sookie's take on life (and death).  (Spoiler alert) I really wanted Vampire Bill to be her one and only, but it wasn't meant to be -- and I can't wait for the &#34;post mortem&#34; in the late fall.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Like other reviewers have said, Super Collider is a mixed bag. Some songs are eh (\\"Built for War\\", I am looking at you), but songs like \\"Kingmaker\\", \\"Burn\\", \\"Off the Edge\\" and \\"Cold Sweat\\" just reassure you that after 30+ years, Dave and company still have it going on. Can't wait for album 15.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|While not le Carre at his greatest, he still produces a readable intrigue with the same eliptical storytelling he is famous for.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|the series is losing steam. this one just kind of coasted along, easy to figure out where the story is going.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was looking forward to this book so fiercely and wound up fiercely disappointed instead. A trilogy means three, yet there's two more to come. This book could have used more story and less sex and filler subplots. There was like at least two to three sex scenes in each chapter. It was like story.....sex...sex...sex...story, and some of the story wasn't even about Eva and Gideon. I TRULY will not buy the next two books in this series. I agree with the other people who posted that the author and publisher should be ashamed, bilking the readers more than necessary. The ending was horrible and disappointing, especially since it leaves you hanging with issues that aren't all tangled with Eva and Gideon. As a matter of fact I actually think this book should have ended as far as Eva and Gideon are concerned. Yes some things are left open and unanswered but not so much that I need another book to finish THEIR story. The book could actually have completed the things left open if it didn't include secondary characters story subplots that were like fillers along with a little less sex and I love you.<br /><br />It would be a good book if it was written as book one of a quintet not a third book of a trilogy turned quintet.<br /><br />If you feel that finishing this book as the end of this 'trilogy' would rush the book, then wasn't getting married in the two weeks rushed. I mean in any other book getting married is the HEA. Also, why would anyone need to keep checking an authors we page to see if there are any changes. And I didn't write my review based on the fact that it went from a 'trilogy' to a five books, I wrote it because it had too many fillers. It's supposed to be about Eva's and Gideon's flaws, demons and love for each other.<br /><br />She should continue this as a BOOK and not a TV SERIES. Let the tv series cover the secondary characters subplots<br /><br />EwY was an enough of a disappointment that I've decided to return it and get a refund., and did.
0679805273|5.0|This is such a cute and fun book. My daughter loves it... I bought it so her teachers could sign it yearly as a reminder.

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|We really enjoyed this Album...um CD, had not heard Boz for years but he still has a fabulous Voice!! nice  arrangements
B00AKKS278|5.0|I am do amazed with this book, actually much more than a book, that I could not stop telling to all my friends about it. Actually, I have send as a gift one Kindle version to one of my good friends and also I am posting all great thoughts to my Facebook page...
B0036UW09U|5.0|I saw this in 1976 when it came out.. loved it then.. The HD streaming was perfect and made it look better than it did then.. Cried at the end as usual.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The first two books were awesome to read. You get to know the main characters better with each turn of the page so getting hooked on the story of Gideon & Eva was easy to do. The author did a fantastic job creating the characters and telling their story. It was time to close their story and I was actually looking forward to it, but it never happened in this third book! There was no closure! I am certainly not going to pay another $9.99 to see what happens either. I'll just have to end it myself with this book. I'm giving this book only two stars - one for Gideon & one for Eva! Hope they have a long & happy life together . . . . . they deserve it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really a must read.  Now exploring Green's other works!  It really explores teens dealing with a terminal illness in a new light.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|hello,<br />  nathan fillion and stana katic are a wonderful pair.  they make the show move every minute they are on the screen.  from the first season to this second season, each has changed.  but, the family relationships in the castle household is the best on tv.  everyone would hope that their families related to each other like the castle household.  the mystery cases have enough twists and turns that is is not just a &#34;cop&#34; show.  the rest of the cast is also outstanding in their supporting roles.  the first season was great, now this second season just makes the castle series that much better.  we can see why they are popular at the comicon shows all over.  great show and super delivery by amazon.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Magical, funny, sweet and unique! I loved this and had waited a while to watch it so had high expectations and it still exceeded them!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|What you have to do with this thing is ram it all the way into the charge port or it won't work. Like seriously, push HARD. The Iphone/Android ports work interchangeably even though they have arrows designating each one. Works on my Amazon Kindle too.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|As my title suggests, the soundtrack for this film is stunning. On top of that is a captivating performance by a young Jack Nicholson that is complimented well by the devilishly seductive Faye Dunaway. It can tend a bit towards the slow side for individuals unfamiliar with film as art (and not solely entertainment). Definitely a must see for those in love with the Film Noir genre.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Kept me interested till the end.  This series was fun and entertaining. Really enjoyed it.  Wish the series would keep on going.  On to TRUE BLOOD next week...
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Not a typical Romantic comedy by any means. Very well written and good acting makes for an enjoyable movie with memorable characters.
B000063V8S|5.0|Picture quality is better than you'll get on netflix, audio is good too, and you get all the bonus stuff too.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|His adventures were amazing and unexpected.  The way it was all tied in to world history was enthralling.Couldn't put it down!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Coming from a man of science, this book makes a compelling story. It is a very comforting read for anyone who has lost a loved one. I wanted all my children to read it.
B000067QMD|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that they indeed had come in a 6 pack.  So I was one of the customers that did order too many.  I have twins, so they will get their use.  Also I was pleased to find that these new sealing disks compared to the older models from a couple years ago have a second rim that accommodate the new natural line.  At first when you put the cap on they seem loose, but when you close the bottle the pressure of the bottle against the cap forms a nice solid seal.  Soo glad they fit the natural bottles.
B000063V8U|5.0|Picture quality is better than you'll get on netflix, audio is good too, and you get all the bonus stuff too.
B000Q67876|5.0|Had this on VHS.  Got it on DVD when DVD came out.  Now I have it on blu-ray.<br /><br />This is a well-acted movie.  It is highly dramatic and starkly graphic, conveying a sense of injustice and ocaasional despair.  It has a fitting ending though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, I like it when I can't figure out the ending half way thru the book. Give this one a read!
B000FC13MM|5.0|Throughout my teenage years I'd go and scour the Young Adult section at my local library, looking for anything new, or at least anything that seemed interesting. I'm pretty sure I pulled Sabriel off the bookshelf primarily for its size - it's pretty thick, and at that point, fat books = the best books.<br /><br />I was immediately sucked into the world Nix had created - a world divided by a Wall. On one side was Ancelstierre, a modern society, a reality identical to my own; the other side, the Old Kingdom, was rife with magic. Sabriel, the young protagonist, faces perils and dark adventures, but she learns, grows and changes as she meets these challenges, and eventually finds that she has the strength to accept her fate and defeat evil. The story is told along a journey, reminiscent in some ways of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, though Nix has a considerably more modern (and less protracted) narrative voice. It's a wonderful, un-put-downable, dynamic fantasy, and I'd recommend it to anyone craving a well-crafted and persuasive high fantasy in the tradition of heroic romance.<br /><br />(review originally posted at: [...]
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Well acted and interesting study on the different attitude of and reactions of humans forced to accommodate to a life very different from their past life.  My husband and I enjoyed the film very much.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I will start by saying that I loved the first 2 books in this series, and have been anxiously awaiting this addition. I pre-ordered it over 7 months ago, so I was excited to start reading; but I had to finish another story before starting this one. Imagine my utter shock and surprise to see the reviews coming in for this, especially that this is not the 3rd in a trilogy. WHY! So after seeing all these reviews, I decided to take a consumer stand and return the unread book for a 9.99 refund, as I was not planning on reading it after reading these reviews. I gave the 2 stars, which represents \\"I don't like it\\" to reflect what I don't like: the fact of this whole thing of waiting for serials (which I don't mind waiting a few months for authors to give us a good f/u story), but waiting so long that you could practically give birth, and then paying 3 times the amount of a typical e book to then find out that a trilogy is stretching out for 2 more books, well, I DON'T LIKE IT, hence the 2 stars. I am so sad and disappointed. It's like going back to summer camp to only find out that your best friends from the past 2 years aren't going to be there. I sure will miss Gideon and Eva.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is dark and sometimes unpredictable. The main characters are likeable despite the situation. The villains turned out not to be who you thought.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|While there are many twists and turns during Season 3, some of which were quite maddening, the series only continues to improve.I look forward to season 4.
0060531053|5.0|I have read over a dozen home brewing and more technical brewing books. This is my top recommendation for anyone at any stage in the hobby. It isn't as technical as some other texts, but is full of creative suggestions. Papazian presents home brewing in an unintimidating, very open-minded fashion that encourages experimentation and new ideas. Papazian is a nuclear engineer by trade, but writes a text that is very accessible and recommends clever simplifications to take the stress out of the technical details of brewing beer. His zeal, creativity, and affinity for home brew is infectious..
B0093FNZT6|5.0|This book is well written & hard to put down once you start reading it.<br /><br />I am only part way through it but already have been affected emotionally by it.<br />Both the author & I have a sibling who we have not physically met.  I say 'not physically&#34;, because he had a vision of his sister which corresponds with a photo he is sent afterwards, he had never met her up until then.  My mother had 3 pregnancies and one of them miscarried which means that I have also lost a brother or sister whom I never met.  Until I read this book plus another which covers properly grieving all sorts of losses & the -ve consequences of just burying grief instead of processing it I never grieved my loss.  Reading Dr Eben's story reminded me of this & so I let the tears flow as well talking to my Father in Heaven (God).  Every time we do this we become more internally resilient & able to move on, prosper & even 'heal' others!<br /><br />This book is more than just a story it could change your life and your future.  If you are skeptical about my claim spend a little bit of money and read it.  The worst thing that could happen is that you use up a little time, the best thing that could happen is you could make a connection with Heaven & experience the love of God in the here & now!
0143034901|1.0|I guess the reason that I joined a book club when I retired was to broaden my exposure to great books. There were things i liked about Zafon's book. I know the writing was well done. There were parts of the book I could only read in the day light. Scary doesn't describe it. Creepy? Maybe. But I could actually smell smoke when the policeman arrived.<br /><br />This is the first book that I have ever read that contained not a single character with who I could identify. I didn't care about any of them. Thus I didn't care about unwinding the intricate at times well written plot.<br /><br />I finished  it so that I could discuss it with the book club. Many of them really liked the book. I appreciate how different it was from anything that I had written.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What else can you say, if you like the series - might as well complete the set.  I have always like Hobbit ever since the old animated movie...
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I was waiting and counting down the days for the last book in this trilogy to be released.  I could not understand why 2/3 of the book was centered around sex, but since it was in Ms Day's captivating writing style, I continued reading just to be disappointed!  I have never returned a book before, and this was my first.  I should have recognized a stalling tactic when I read it. All of these looonggg marathon sex sessions going on and on.  Just so that there can now be 5 books.  And what for? What a waste!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book started my fascination (a couple of years back) with John Scalzi as a writer and story-teller--not all writers are good story-tellers and not all good story-tellers are good writers; Scalzi is both; he will cause you to cry, laugh, pause in thought. Most all of his books are 'good', but I think this was his best, but try some of his other books if you do not like sci-fi-military--he does not just write about war--Agent to the Stars; The Android's Dream; The Last Colony (read 'Old Man's War' before this one); etc.
0812983459|4.0|I am not positive that Harold Fry and his son had asperger's syndrome. But as the story moved along, I saw clues to how these men felt about the world around them and how they could relate to it. Harold's journey gave him the opportunity to examine his life and at least wish that he had made other choices. His journey also gave him the chance to watch total stranger's behavior. He was wonderful about not judging others. And he learned something from each person that he met. This new knowledge gave him the chance to become a different man after the pilgrimage.<br /><br />Mrs. Fry had a journey of her own. Harold's absence allowed her to reach back and touch the poignant memories of their life together, There were painful memories, but also incredibly sweet things that she had forgotten. His pilgrimage allowed her to be a different woman.<br /><br />What am I learning from my journey?
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I haven't used it too much yet, but the tests I have done on it seem pretty good.  My only concern so far is the the sharpness of it.  I read another's posting on this and I might see if there is a way to adjust the focus a bit to see if it will get sharper.  Other than that, it seems to do what I needed it for - making quick work of zillions of slides.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I know know, only 2 or 3 songs are good. The rest are sh.... I expected more for this artist.

0307730697|5.0|I loved getting to know this man, even if just a little. As much as I respect his rugged ability to overcome the obstacles to become a SEAL, even more so I respect his fight to overcome the demons of addiction.<br />For anyone who struggles with addiction---read this book. For anyone who knows someone who is fighting addiction, get this book and give it to them to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the whole thing about this game I think every month they change places because when I got it it was May and in Tokyo and now it's June and in Miami!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Drama, romance and comedy...the makings of a fine production.  Bradley Cooper shines in this role and does Jennifer Lewis.  Always love Deniro in anything he does.
0307476073|3.0|I am not a fan of books like this, read for my book club. Several of them loved this book, me not so much. Since it was autobiographical I got upset with the author several times, cannot believe she made the choices she did. On my own I would not buy.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian has a way of drawing in the reader in the first chapter.  She did it again!  I couldn't put this book down .. Love the surprise ending!!,
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Bought this for my grandson's 10th birthday.  He absolutely loves it.  It is his favorite birthday present.  I felt the pieces were rather small so I would not recommend it for younger children.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The third installment of Sylvia Day's \\"Crossfire\\" series picks up right where the second ended. Eva and Gideon are faced with restarting their relationship in secrecy - hiding from the watchful eyes of family, the authorities, the press, and ex-lovers conspiring against them - while internally dealing with the consequences of what Gideon had done.<br /><br />Now, Gideon and Eva now have to rely on each other more than ever. In this though, they are shutting out others around them, making Eva almost solely dependent on Gideon.<br /><br />The build-up and anticipation of Entwined with You is well done, as usual, but this story mimics the skeletal structure of the previous two books; you kind of already know what's in store.<br /><br />This time around though, Gideon has opened himself up to Eva and is continuously putting himself out there. He still has his secrets, though these mainly involve Eva's \\"safety.\\" Despite her protests, he refuses to include her in on the circus that surrounds them, opting to make some major decisions and stalk Eva without her knowledge.<br /><br />About ¾ of the way through, one too many over-dramatic plot points and reveals come into play. Instead of having a couple of plates spinning delicately and perilously at the same time, everything is tossed at you at once over the course of a few chapters. And not all of it, seemingly, has much to do with one another.<br /><br />Did Sylvia Day just throw every plot point she could think of for effect? I'm not sure, but I honestly had no idea what I was supposed to be focusing on. Which character, which story, which detail was important? And sadly, Sylvia didn't make that clear to the reader.<br /><br />For example, Eva gets up from her table at a charity function and in a matter of seconds encounters three separate people serving three separate storylines, trying to start trouble with her. Come. On.<br /><br />I completely agree with some of the other reviewers that Entwined with You was a very poor attempt at stretching out this series for more money. Cary's story is tiresome. I don't care about Megumi, so stop trying to make me interested in her. Corrine's plotline took such a drastic turn from how she was presented in the previous two books and reminded me a bit too much of FSOG.<br /><br />Also, about halfway through, I thought for sure Eva's dad was going to be framed for the murder. I would have traded Cary, Megumi, the boss, and Corrine in for THAT story.<br /><br />After having all of this put out there for the reader - none of which is resolved -  everyone just goes home and goes to bed. Seriously. I understand there is a fourth installment, but I am a bit disappointed Entwined with You did little to move the story forward.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Bale is excellent in this movie. There are a few TSTL moments in it, but it's one of the better post-apocalyptic movies I've seen, overall.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Whenever I have five minutes spare I know I can enjoy myself on this game, it is great fun to play and a little bit addictive at times.

B008JJM88Q|5.0|We are having fun with this app! I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and hasn't asked for any personal information at all.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|You do get sort of a creepy vibe from the Joanna subplot, since much of the early interaction she had with Anthony was cut from the movie, so it seems a lot more stalkerish than the stage show/story were. The movie is also missing a bit of music that was on the stage, which often happens. It did with CATS as well. But overall, it's a very powerful and enjoyable film adaptation.
0425263924|3.0|I can take it that this is no longer a trilogy, I was very disappointed in this book; after her first two book being 5 stars this one was truly did not live up to the standards. All I can say is WTH, seriously we have more questions than answers, I feel like the author is unnecessarily drawing the book out, after the first couple of chapters she could have delved into the heart of the story and answers all the questions making this a true trilogy. We had to wait sooooo long for this book only to have to wait for another one. I must say  for the phenomenal writer that Ms. Day is this is her first book I have read that I am truly disappointed in; I hope the next one will be the final book and put Eva and Gideon's story back at 5 stars. I also hope we don't have to wait forever for the next installment.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I first saw History of the Eagles on Showtime back in February, and subsequently had watched it numerous times and cannot get enough of it.  I have always been an Eagles fan, having grown up in their era, and I listen to their CD's over and over.  I was thrilled to find out that they were during a History of the Eagles Tour and am going to see them in Philadelphia on July 16th and hopefully, they will also have bookings in South Florida where I live so my friends and I can enjoy them here too!

B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Very nice entartainment for a group, competitive and challenging. Mix of emotins, from relief to frustration in finding or not the right work, that can seem so obvious after someone else say it.
B001QVFDA4|4.0|Great show. One of my favorites. It's a mixture of action and comedy. Gerard Butler is top notch in this. I truly enjoy all of Guy Richie's films.
B007LNJ4YW|4.0|This is a good album - no stand out tracks.<br /><br />The sort of album I'll listen to for a few months - then forget about for a couple of years as it sits on the shelf.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am very pleased with his product! I was prefect and for the price yo sold it for, was a great deal!<br />Thank you for advertising it on Amazon. Cheree  ;-)
B008JJM88Q|5.0|After an hour and a half, my co workers and myself combined were only able to stump it once with a video game character. Picked up everything from Nathan Explosion, to a few not so famous authors, to Maze from the video game series Fable (which I thought for sure would stump it). Pretty awesome
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This application works well on the kindle.  It delivers a smooth interface for reading blogs and interfaces well with other internet sites.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Really you don't need a review to know how awesome this show is.<br /><br />I am out of superlatives to describe its awesomeness.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|IF YOU LOVED THE FIFTY SHADES SERIES, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK AND SYLVIA DAY'S WRITING. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE
B001GJOL22|3.0|I bought this as a gift, and don't know if the recipient liked it or not.  I assume he did as it was on his wish list.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I had put off watching this for a long time because of the lame title, but it turns out this is a great show. It's more LA Law meets Ally Macbeal meets Law and Order, which ain't bad. I really really like it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|If you thought fifty shades was bad, this is worse.<br /><br />The previous two books was great, so was the 'ending'. Spent months looking forward to the end if this book. Publishing date was pushed back so I thought 'Nevermind good things are worth waiting for.<br /><br />This book was a total disappointment. It totally feels like the author was trying to milk out her fame from the crossfire series and get more money out of faithful readers.<br /><br />Very disappointing book. Not worth paying for even if its offered at 0.99$ what more if its not.<br /><br />One sentence to sum it all up: Time wasting, disappointing and boring, shameful addition to what could have been a fantastic trilogy.<br /><br />P/S: never bothered to write a review but just felt I had to.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have always admired Nicola Tesla and I resd everything I can about him. This book gave me new incite.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Traditional Mahjong with many choices of tower shapes.  I rated this game 5 stars because Mahjong is my favorite game in any format.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|This is a awesome CD. Every song on the CD is great! I would buy any CD they come out with.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A quick read, but one very much worth the time - worth five times the time, in fact. A fantastic whirlwind fantasy I very much loved.
B009OCR1X4|4.0|I saw the movie first and wanted the soundtrack becasue I liked the movie so much.It is now part of my play list on my Ipod and like the classical aspects butit has notes notlike Bach or other &#34;clasical&#34; composers. Now that the dvd has been released I appreciate the sound track more and thedvd has a greater meaning then when I saw itin the movies.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Graphics are great for a phone game, its kinda like a super modified much better graphical Pac-Man, only you eat other planets.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After much debate about reading this book...I finally decided to read it. I'm glad I did, I have enjoyed reading this very well written book. The plot held my attention all the way through, full of surprises, action, suspense, and emotions. All in all...a great book...I can't wait to read the next book!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Somehow throughout my adolescence I managed to ignore my my friends' advice and never read any Orson Scott Card books. I find myself now in my late 20's and at a point in my life that I am catching up on quite a few books that I have somehow managed to not read. This was one of them.<br /><br />I finished it in a day and a half.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card tells a magnificent tale of youth, rivalry, and growing up in a futuristic society that does battle with an alien planet. Those of you who aren't into sci-fi, hold your horses. While this is set in the future and does contain sci-fi elements, that is not what makes it a great story. What it is truly about is the human condition and what makes us human. As I turned the pages as quickly as I could, I found myself thinking that while this story could clearly be enjoyed by children, adults will enjoy it for an entirely different reason. Card somehow manages to explore the complex workings of the human mind in a way that is simplistic and fun to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with isolation in his or her life, is considering (or is in) the military, is a philosophy student, or is just looking for an exciting, adventurous story to enjoy.<br /><br />This book deserves everyone of the 5 stars that I awarded it. If you haven't had the opportunity to jump into the Enderverse, now is your chance!
B00464AVXW|5.0|Great Crime/Thriller movie with a secret killer & end plot that you will not believe. Morgan Freeman at his best playing with a loud mouthed boisterous partner Brad Pitt. 127 minutes of great acting from both. The TV version was only 90 minutes (commercials). A great buy! Must see!-m
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|What can I say that others haven't? It's Aloha, its Elvis. It's Freakin'  Fantastic! Get this for the Alternate concert on cd 2. It sounds great. Elvis forgets some lyrics, mainly in Burning Love,  But he remembers most of them. It's a good show. This is one of Elvis's last great  concerts on record. Get this with the Legacy Live At Madison Square Garden. Thank you Elvis fans around the whole world. Thank You very much. Adios.
B00821OX98|5.0|It seems like it has become so hard for anyone to create a good sic-fy show. The main problem I think being the overly critical fan boys out there. I mean come on as much as I love it most of the Star Trek shows had major flaws. Great job to TNT for persisting with this great new show and not being afraid of creating this wild fantasy for us all to join in to.
B00CVSMLXS|5.0|If you're considering purchasing this show, I would deduce that you are already the right person for this show.  An excellent underlying plot overall for the season, and engaging sub-plots along the way are far overshadowed by the incredible performance of Johnny Lee Miller.  \\"Elementary\\" is akin to a crime-drama version of \\"House\\" only the main character seems so much more like a real person.  Seriously, DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW!
B007N85POS|3.0|Have most of the AB games, of them this is the one I liked the least. It works well on the tablet.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Many of the same actors as Calendar Girls.  Delightful characters fill the story.  You could fel the pulse of India in th background.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Still getting used to what happens in space, but so far we like the game. Wish the birds and pigs were larger so I could see them better. But so far, so good.
B008KYL2UK|5.0|My grandson thinks I'm the greatest!  He and his brothers love Legos and of course anything Hobbitt!  A great buy!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is bloody brilliant. Every episode delivers in one episode what the major networks deliver in 3 (ABC's Scandal excluded). It answers questions and does so without making it a campy sci fi cheese fest. Instead its a fast paced thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Orphan Black delivers heart by exploring the relationships our girls have with each other and those outside of Clone Club as well as it affects to the girls as individuals and what that means to each. This gives the show weight and keeps it from getting lost in the science. Then there is just enough well timed comedy that it cleanses the pallet and keeps you from feeling bogged down in doom and gloom. All of those traits come from smart writing and flawless acting by every single member of the cast. Every bit of praise Tatiana has gotten is just. This young actor is delivering a focus to detail in her performances and the characters that she brings to life that reminds me of why people like Meryl Streep are so great. You forget that you're watching Meryl Streep or Tatiana Maslany and only see the characters that they play. I can't wait for season 2 and have so much faith in this team that a sophomore slump isn't even a worry.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I mainly use it to share photos with out of state family and with my children locally.  I now use Flicker and share less and less on the way too intrusive FB.  I will eventually quit it all together.  Actually a 2 1/2 star for me.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I loved the Tolkien books so much I read them 3 times in my teens and I loved the animated film. However, I enjoyed this film as a new perspective on a much loved story.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|this book was excellent, i also saw the movie.  i will be ordering another Bronte novel.  Thank amazon  for their books and my kindle whick i love.
B008M721MS|5.0|No words to describe just trust me and get this app right now stop reading this and get it !!! Go on go
B0072NWKEC|4.0|I liked Mr. Kerr's book and found it very interesting, especially dealing with the History in Germany during WW II.  I liked the plot and the pace of the book.  My only problem were the German names, hard to pronounce, but other than that it was a good read, great on the historical aspect, and enjoyable change.  Cliff Mitts
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great details on the surroundings and characters. It makes you feel like you were really in the arena. It will keep you on the edge of your seat!!!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble always takes you to the romantic side and this is a wonderful example of that.  Get your love on.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This movie has meat with no raw scenes... Loved it, glad we bought it! Highly recommended!!! A movie with real acting!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I am reading all of Mr. Child's books having enjoyed every one of them.  My problem is that I find it hard to put them down to eat, sleep, shop, those necessary life requirements.  Most likely I will re read them in the future because near the end, I speed read them suggesting that I probably missed something.  Cliff Mitts
0525952926|5.0|The book was intriguing and met my expectations set forth in the first book.  I can hardly wait until the 3rd comes out!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a delightful film, so entertaining that you do not even notice that it is sub-titled. It is based on a true story and that makes it compelling.  It ought to be depressing, but is funny and fun and uplifting.  The acting is wonderful.  The film won awards in France and should have won some here.  This is a film I can watch over and over.
B0034G4OYK|4.0|Decent story.  Good animation.  3D looks good.  Listening to Adam Sandler do Dracula for 90 minutes is a bit rough but at the end of the day, my kids LOVE it.  Everything else is just blah, blah, blah!
B005PK553C|5.0|I was recommended this show by a friend & LOVED it! It is riveting & disturbing at the same time! althoigh there were many different story lines; it was wonderful how these were tied in together by the season finale.
0307477479|3.0|This book was from a required selection for my class! It's not what I expected it to be. If i were majring in Pyschology, this book would be the ideal book to study by.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was BY FAR the best book in the series so far!  I LOVED the how the relationship between Gideon and Eva grew and matured. I LOVED the development of many of the secondary characters in this book and how they added to the story. I felt there was just enough drama to keep me interested, but nit so much that it felt forced or over the top!!! I don't know how Sylvia Day could make me fall even more in love with Gideon, but she did!!!!<br /><br />I would also like to say that I LOVED the ending!  I was glad that I left off in the place it did instead of leaving us some dramatic cliffhanger that we might have to wait too long for.<br /><br />And I don't understand why there are all these low ratings because there are going to be 2 more books!!!  WHAT???  Why are people complaining about this???  Give me more Gideon any way I can get him!!!!!
0316227706|5.0|Amazing, funny photos of dogs swimming underwater.  Great gift for the person who loves dogs.  My little nieces loved it!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Appropriate title as the book moves along and Harry becomes a 'stand alone' figure in the drama and so after solving the ??? he makes it right
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|Wonderful music to have in the background, and the piano pieces are very moving. Very happy with my purchase, and the movie is just as good
B00942G4UA|4.0|I found it extremely informative some of it changed my ideas about what I would want to eat and where to buy certain foods. This country's businesses are getting so big in so many areas and competition suffers and then so do we in terms of price and choice.<br />This is a major one because we all eat the same food.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What?????  I thought this this book was going to conclude the trilogy.  What happened.  I'm very disappointed that I now have to buy another book....although I love the characters......it seems like more of a financial decision than an editorial decision.  Too bad.
B00BD62X14|4.0|Classic Carla Bruni, still prefer her first album but am enjoying this a lot as well.  It's simple melodies and her charming voice make for very pleasant listening.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app it is so fun!!!!  It really gives me something to do in my free time it rocks.
B00138KKMQ|5.0|So good I wish we could find it on vinyl too! Just what I expected all of the hits and a few not my favorites but all the best are on here!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this and felt Suzanne Collins did an exceptional job of painting a society that is sort of like ours but with a much bloodier edge.  She took on the &#34;reality show&#34; concept with vigor.  I kept wondering, however, how a modern society could stand for such brutality - but of course look at the Nazi regime, Stalin and others accused of genocide, etc. - and that provides your answer.  I thought the writing was strong and vivid and it was a definite page turner...overall good read.  This should offer kids something to consider - how anyone can come through a terrible situation by keeping calm, being brave, thinking clearly, etc.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is my new favorite Disney movie. I love it so much. My husband and I are in our 20s, & we absolutely loved this movie!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is awsome because it is free and it was never for the Amazon but it is now. The game it is fun for all ages. I wasted my money on hill racer because there was not this game at the time do NOT BUY HILL RACER it is nothing like this game.
B009KHCT94|3.0|It was ok, worth a watch if you are bored. Not all that exciting or awesome. Much longer than it should have been.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It is Angry Birds What can I say? Always good to see that the creative geniuses at Angry Birds haven't gotten bored.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|Love the movie but there is a color on this that appears yellow.  Not certain if the disc is defective or not.  Movie in theatre did not seem yellowed when saw it there.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I LOVE the book this is my favorite book of all time RJ Palacio is WONDERful I HOPE THERE IS A second book
B008Y73940|5.0|I loved the movie and its plot. I saw it on the first page of recommended movies for me but never dared to click it, thinking that it might not be worth it. However, the movie was so good that I felt sorry for not watching it earlier. I am sure most people would like this movie.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I had hunted for the DVD for several months.  I wanted it for a special little girl.  Amazon must have gotten tired of my inquiries because there appeared an Amazon e-mail with the Little Mermaid available to ship, no shipping charge, and I received it within seven days.  I love the movie and my little friend did as well.  Thank you Amazon for making &#34;In The Vault&#34; things available when they are needed.  Love Amazon!!
B0069GRIHW|5.0|My favorite Doors album. Sounds modern even today as the Doors moved on to progressive rock and blues and largely left behind the hippy organ sound of their early  works.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I grew up on Hitchcock films and remember seeing him on the Tonight Show and the TV series with his introductions and follow up comments. I never knew a lot about his struggles.
B0054SMID0|3.0|This was an interesting ride, but I'd need to watch it again, since there's no nagging recollection of the film.  That persistent tug of interesting scenes, plot or character development, would indicate a better film than three stars, and an encouragement to purchase.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This is an update from when it froze. Sometimes, it won't work at all - some kind of a connection issue but, most of the time, it works fine. I am glad I gave it another chance. It has an amazing collection of knowledge and ways to narrow down the who or what. I don't know how it determines at times, so soon in the process, that it needs to ask, for example, does your character have an iconic mustache or is your character related to aviation but, at that point, I know he's got it, usually.  I have stumped him numerous times but the majority of the time, he knows.  The graphics are great, colorful and when he is frustrated, I love his expression. My only issue is my own limitations - thinking of another character to stump him.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is good but it needs new stuff and more free stuff and board but a part from that it's a good game [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is free and really addicting and It auto updates to the new version! I downloaded Tokyo but today it updated to Miami!!
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I had fun with the game, want to get the full game. I will spend my money. I love it, it was hard some places but not all. Get it if u want to cares for animals.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Her books are always catchy.  Will definitely read more of Kay's books.  All her books are rated high by me
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited so long for this book and now I just feel robbed! I don't think I can read anymore, I could've spent my money on something better
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I enjoyed this very much. It reminds me of some of the other business parables I've read, such as Tom Demarco's 'The Deadline'.<br /><br />Setting it in an IT department of a manufacturer, where people are under constant Death Marches and the real possibility of the company failing or all of IT outsourced worked very well, especially since the IT improvement revelations the main character, Bill, has are all concepts drawn from manufacturing, such as Kanban and the effects of bottlenecks in the production line.<br /><br />All in all, a good read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't put it down and I can't wait to read more and I don't usually read books. I didn't think I had the time but I have found time.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love the movie and the music.  I used to leave the movie on just to hear the music so I finally just bought the music.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Trilogy means 3 books.  This book was advertised as the conclusion.  Come to find out the story has been extended to 5.  You won't be getting any more money from me Sylvia Day.
B000NV55RY|5.0|I never knew he was so funny an actor. This spoof was quite well done. The cast was fun and the whole thing was just primo cheese.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A book that everyone should read. Learning how to love others brings so much happiness into both the giver and the receivers life.
0307388840|5.0|I gave this to a high school graduate who wants to be a director and has already won awards for his short films.  I gave him Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, both directed by Joe Wright, so he can view them from a director's perspective.  He will get a lot out of the director's comments bonus.  Joe Wright has an artists' eye.  He misses no opportunity to include beauty, ugliness and sound where it applies and enhances the story. Because of language and an intimate scene, this is not a movie for a young person.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OH MY GOD this game is freiken amazing you can look at all the other 8000 reviews none will say it was bad in any way
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Overall I think this is their best work to date.  A must for any fan or country music lover.  Buy it
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I gave it a 2 star because the story was ok. Not too much was revealed as anticipated. I waited several months for this book to come out, get all the way to the end....and nothing! Come to find out, there's 2 more installments to this story! Not to mention the cost of each book. The story seemed to focus too much on the constant \\"boinkfest\\" instead of a quality story. HUGE letdown! This is too much like a daily soap opera on tv. You can read one of the books, miss one, come back and nothing has changed. I'm done with this saga and author.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|As a fan of the TV show I bought one of these for myself.  My neice was singing along while she was in the car with me, so I sent her volume 1 and 2 as a gift.  She loves them!
B008673ZAQ|1.0|This trilogy is totally amazing.Sylvia Day  is a very inspiring writer.she can make you laugh and cry all in the same page.this couple goes through  he'll and back yet still seem to keep it together.A must read.Now onto the next book for the grand finale.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|It was actually pretty fun. but after I quit the app the music WOULD NOT STOP!!!! I even went into the app and shut off all of the sounds and still played. I turned off my kindle and STILL it played!!! The only way I got the stupid music to stop was by deleting the app. This app isn't very good. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|I enjoyed the first film as a view into the Israeli Army ,and the complexity of being a gay indiviual there  at that time,not to mention the problems it posed for the main characters. In the end it was Bittersweet as Yossi finally realized the sadness he had reaped while keeing his relationship a secret,and never truly professing the Love that he felt for Jagger. In this sequel we find that although he has spent 10 years of his life,fulfilling his professional goals,his emotional life has been put on hold with a seeming endless series of experiences that lacked intimacy or meaning. All this very well presented ,developed , written, and directed by Fox. Yes it's believeable. The best part is that just as we might have hoped for him , this time around he's learned a valuable lesson,and the ride we take with he ,and his new teacher is well worth it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I bought several to give as gifts.  One to a high school graduate who wants to be a director and has already won awards for his short films.  I gave him Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, both directed by Joe Wright, so he can view them from a director's perspective.  He will get a lot out of the director's comments bonus.  Joe Wright has an artists' eye.  His misses no opportunity to include beauty and sound, the chirping of birds, the flicker of a candle, etc.  The music is also beautiful and plays an important role in this movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have watched in a VERY long time. I sort of expected it to just be an okay film to tie up a few hours at best on a long plane ride but was extremely surprised by what a great job they did with it, especially since the plot was only loosely based off of a video game!<br /><br />I'll keep this review short since I am sure many others will elaborate in great detail the specifics of the different aspects of the movie, but overall, as a 23 year old who is beyond the normal audience for this film, I really enjoyed it and would honestly recommend it for anyone I know, you won't regret it! I rented this from Amazon (streamed in perfect HD by the way :) ), but will certainly be picking up a copy to own shortly - definitely worth watching at least once! I plan on watching it many more times!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I forgot McClane Sr had a son. Nice that they followed up on that story. Jai Courtney is good as Jack McClane Jr. Usual hilarious plot with non-stop unbelievable action movie crap. Just what you want when you want to watch a Die Hard movie. All set in Russia (Moscow and Chernobyl) with cartoony characters and hoaky Russian accents. Lots of laughs. And the inevitable family reunion at the end is sweet.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|My friend had Night Sky and showed it to me.  It is fascinating.  Just hold your phone up and you get an exact picture of the night sky where you are at.  Shows the constellations and all the Zodiac groups.  If you have trouble spotting them, get the Night Sky, you will marvel at the ease of finding all the groups.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm not going to go into a huge detailed review anymore than the previous customers have because they've done it far better than I could on this one. All I'm going to say is that if you have the collection already on DVD and now have a large 1080p LCD, then I recommend picking this up to get the best possible image you can to view Star Wars in all it's glory on your big tv. Otherwise, I don't suppose there is much else added in this that the DVD collection doesn't already contain.<br />  Besides that, the actual product is real nice. The case is designed to be almost like a book that you flip through the pages containing each disc accompanied with some artwork for that episode. The box is well constructed and durable. Think tough cardboard.<br />  Recommended!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love love this game it will let you get addictive and forget that you are doing something important that's how good it is.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Like many of you,I waited anxiously for the arrival of ETW. I was really surprised at all the negative reviews, so I was a little worried. NO NEED...when you write a review, it should be a review of the book, not about the author. Sylvia Day announced a while back that it would take longer to really tell Gideon & Eva's story. Hence the extension to five books total. So, if you're rating the story based on that, I can see why you'd be upset. BUT...if you're rating the book...be honest! I loved seeing the two of them behind closed doors, just being together while still trying to maintain everything the world sees. I enjoyed their interactions with other characters and those story lines. I think readers will be happy with the direction of their journey. Looking forward to books 4 & 5.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My 8 year old likes all the different vehicles and you can modify them to make them better.  You get coins for doing well in races that let you make modifications to your vehicle.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|A fitting ending to a great series. you should have always known she would pick this one! Fun reading all around.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|Amazing and intense movie based on real events! I absolutely love this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in history in general or about Five Points.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I wanted to explore further into David Lynch's films after having seen Blue Velvet and Lost Highway. The Elephant Man is probably one of the most straight forward films in Lynch's body of work. There are a few short, trippy sequences in this movie, which more closely resemble the stranger side of Lynch, but overall, it's an easy to follow film that depicts a very unique life story. The Elephant Man is an interesting dramatized character story of a severely deformed man who transcends the abusive life of the freak show circuit and gains dignity and acceptance. I won't go into lengthy detail about the plot, but having worked with children with severe disabilities, I enjoyed this film and the way it casts a hopeful light for people who have been historically marginalized/abused. As usual, Anthony Hopkins is excellent and plays a doctor who truly was ahead of his time in acknowledging the humanity in someone who had never been treated as a human. Highly recommended!
076115678X|4.0|I learned a lot about how to care for my hair. I learned how to 'no poo' wash my hair and how to style. I loved the fact that she gives you a DVD. I try to inspire my sisters to go natural now. Good buy, quick read and great information!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Overall pretty fun simulation game. Would be better if you could suspend goals. But offers a lot of goals and pretty easy to play without having to pay money to pay.
1401322786|4.0|So far I have found Nothing from Mitch Albom that I don't Love. As for the seller, I am very pleased with the condition of the book and on how quickly I received it. I would recommend this book and the seller to anyone.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this game. a guy told me to get it and I was like ok... and I got it and now its all I can talk about!! love it get if u don't ur missing out!
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|In all honesty prior to the introduction of the HBO series I had never even heard of George Martin or his ongoing A Song of Ice and Fire saga. However in light of the continuous praise and adoration which the television series has garnered I decided to throw myself into this fantasy world and see what it's all about. This past June I picked up the novel \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and chose to read it in its entirety before actually watching the show and I'm glad I did for two reasons: first because it always helps to read the book upon which a television show or film is adapted from (as it gives you a better understanding and appreciation for the visual media) and second because it sparked a passion and love for a written series that I haven't experienced since I picked up Tolkein's works in the early 2000s. It's mid-August now and I'm nearly 200 pages into Martin's third book \\"A Storm of Swords\\".<br /><br />Enough about that though let's talk about the actual show.<br /><br />Although HBO is well known for producing some incredibly popular and award winning programs I feel confident in stating that they've never been responsible for something quite like \\"Game of Thrones\\". This show easily rises above others like The Sopranos, True Blood, Entourage, and Boardwalk Empire and is only matched in its scope and ambition by the unfortunately short-lived Rome.<br /><br />In only ten episodes every single actor and actress manages to generate a performance the likes of which isn't found in most Academy Award-tailored films. Big names like Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings, Silent Hill, Goldeneye), Lena Headey (300), and Mark Addy (The Full Monty) certainly live up to their reputations as minor celebrities but the most noteworthy and truly skilled/sincere performances come from the virtually unknown and rather young cast. One standout is certainly Emilia Clarke who beautifully portrays the evolution of her character Daenerys Targaryen from a timid, frightened girl to easily the most powerful and strong female character of the entire series. Another would be Kit Harington (Jon Snow) who plays the outcast bastard son of Sean Bean's character as he tries to find his place in the world within the Night's Watch but must come face to face with the realities of his choices while attempting to wrestle with his loyalty to the Watch versus his loyalty to his father, brothers, and sisters which he vowed to leave behind.<br /><br />As previously mentioned the scope of the show is larger than most since it has to provide for events and story arcs taking place across a massive continent from the viewpoints of several different characters. Thankfully the writers for the show managed to effectively capture Martin's skill in seamlessly transitioning between all of these within the 50 odd minute time constraints per episode - resulting in a viewing experience that is easy to watch and keep track of. To account for the distinctive changes in location Northern Ireland and Malta proved to be very indispensable for scenes covering the cold North, the fertile south, the exotic Essos, and thriving capital city of King's Landing.<br /><br />In terms of the actual story-line of the series the best way to think of it is taking the political intrigue and merciless back-stabbing of Showtime's \\"The Tudors\\" and \\"The Borgias\\" and setting that inside a fictional fantasy world like the Britannia of Arthurian legends or Tolkein's Middle Earth (minus things like elves, dwarves, orcs, etc). Martin, however, enjoys putting a unique spin on his work that really gives both the novels and the show a kick - mainly the realistic notion that the world is an unjust place filled with selfish, two-faced, and amoral individuals who will go to great lengths to take power or hold on to it...the icing on the cake being that these people usually end up winning while the noble and honor-bound suffer and die as pawns in their schemes. Once the show really gets waist deep in these sinister plots its hard to keep away from it as the drive to know what happens next can easily overcome you.<br /><br />As a Blu-Ray/Home Video release I found myself more pleased with these extras than most. In fact, I hardly ever check out behind-the-scenes clips or featurettes but I was definitely drawn into watching all of these. For the most part the \\"Making Of\\" and other such features are just like any other but what stands out as being the most interesting and worthwhile is the impressively extensive \\"Complete Guide to Westeros\\". Included in this sizable feature are Westerosi legends, histories, geographic information, and other bits of knowledge on the relevant Great Houses all narrated by actors and actresses from the show (namely Michelle Fairley, Issac Hempstead-Wright, and Mark Addy among others). This proves to be an invaluable resource for both those that have never picked up the books or those that have yet to read all five novels in the saga. Just as in the show, Martin chooses to only mention the history of his world through relevant dialogue or events inside the books. Unlike Tolkein there are no ten page tangents about cultures, wars, or folklore and personally I don't like that very much since the result of it is bits and pieces of information scattered throughout different chapters of different books and thus the inability to fully understand or appreciate references made to the past within the show. This Guide however compiles all the background knowledge you'll need in relation to the first season's characters and events.<br /><br />As a final thought I'll just remind any readers that which numerous others have already mentioned: this is a show for adults. It might be fantasy but its \\"dark fantasy\\" - filled with murder, war, foul/sexually explicit language, and nudity/sex....there's ALOT of sex in this season (so much so that it borders on unnecessary in my opinion).<br /><br />Finally, for those out there that are hardcore purists take comfort in the fact that this season plays it pretty close to the source material. Very few liberties are taken with the events and characters as first described in the novel - the most significant of changes being the exclusion of non-critical scenes and dialogue or the addition of scenes to account for inner-monologues and thoughts. Martin himself was incredibly happy with the end product and even goes so far as to say in one of the features that this show is his world come to life.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game on the boat on the plane at work durning downtime, at home evenings and weekends. DIAMONDS
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I loved the movie, so, I decided to read the book.  I was extremely disappointed!  It was SO different from the movie and was NOT what I expected.  I feel that it was a complete waste of my time and my money.  O, well...
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This movie has a simple plot, nothing crazy. I thought it was cute and would be great for teens. The characters are lovable and the music is enjoyable. I would recommend anyone who likes a love story to watch this.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I read a bunch of reviews on this product before I bought it and I can't believe that I didn't come across other reviewers with this same complaint. When you put the Kindle into the Marware's plastic base, it doesn't snap or lock in. It just kind of fits in sort of tight but there's no lip or locking mechanism to really hold it. But I assumed since they've sold thousands of these it must hold the Kindle tight enough to keep it from falling out. Wrong. I was reading in bed and my Kindle fell out on my chest. Fortunately I found this out on a soft bed and not on a hard floor.<br /><br />This thing is also really thick. This doesn't bother me as much as the bigger problem stated above though.<br /><br />Finally, the hand strap on the back would suit me better if it was mounted diagonally or if it was somehow adjustable. Being straight up and down just wasn't comfortable or useful to me.<br /><br />I returned the Marware and ordered the less expensive Fintie and from what I've seen it is a simpler and better design for about half the price.<br /><br />I would look for something better and not buy this Marware product.
B001GMH8SI|4.0|is ok movie to be thru... i recomend to watch it but not to have it is not to see twice
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I really want people to be aware of the dangers in downloading this app. Check the permissions. They are many and invasive. There is no wonder so many people claim it stops working. It is probably some type of spyware or adware. None the less, it will more than likely load junk detrimental to your device. Amazon has a habit of including these apps as the faotd.I always check the permissions from apps, especially the faotd apps. I recommend everyone to do the same.
1401940676|5.0|It's awesome first awareness of death that makes sense I love it and love the way she has written it
B0018QQQK8|4.0|What kind of ending is that? There should have been another chapter to this book. Not a seemingly superficial epilogue!
B0017VG69U|5.0|Original Star Trek is a brilliant show and implanted vision into our possible future. Season Two is Trek at the peak of its stride, bold, funny, and usually intelligent.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I like high tech themes that DON'T go into the area of science fiction.  This novel was easy to follow and a quick read.  I did not think about it after finishing, however.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is so awesome if you ever wanted to own your own jurassic park I recommend this game 5000% it is so awesome did I mention it was awesome
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Fun game unless u don't like violence. Best game I've played from Amazon.<br />Need to get if don't have as soon as possible!!
B0026S98TS|4.0|This album rocks but not like original heaven and hell album. Not bad though for a bunch of old guys.
B009B4ZEKM|1.0|Christina Aguilera  is a wonderful  singer with awesome range. I have the sound track as well as the DVD of Burlesque. If you haven't seen it, it is well worth seeing AND Christina is the BEST in it! Her vocals are show stopping!<br />But this music on this was awful new style (kinda like J Lo's new stuff with all the synthesizers) that covers up any good vocals....So I listened once, disappointed, then wrapped it up and got a return label and sent it back!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great movie, excellent suspense, great action - Tom Cruise does a really good job in this movie. If you like action and suspense you will love this movie
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much it was very entertaining and fun to watch. will be watching it again and again
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Great preformance of Mark Whalberg.  Excellent plot that will keep you guessing all movie long.  Once you start watching, you won't leave it until it's over.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|Minimalistic Player.  Only automatically stops.  There are no start controls.  Arm must be manually positioned and lowered to vinyl.  Sound reproduction is adequate at best.  Of course, what do you want for the money?
0307474259|5.0|This is one of the bests books I have read in a long time. If you like data and research information to prove the point this book is for you. Excellent explanation of &#34;Why we get fat&#34; and reasons with research base literature.
B003XU02QG|3.0|Fassbender is a cool and tight actor.  The film was making a huge effort to attract young boys with the over wrought blood spurts and flying body parts.  The story has a solid moral base and thus has a message.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|just ok. It was ok but knocked up was wayyyyyyyyy better! But still well worth it to download and watch!!!!!!
B0083Z614S|3.0|I had read this book as a child, and remembered it being a wonderful book. It was about 2/3 of the way through, at which time I found it conflicted with my world view. As a Christian, I am not to participate in any way with the occult or spiritual world. I did finish reading it but wouldn't recommend it for children.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love my kindle access, use it frequently and on several electronic devices. Have gotten others to use Kindle also. Thank you
B007QDNKQA|5.0|If your an action move fan then this is a movie for you.  Good acting and script, fast paced and fun
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this, not the way this season ended but I am waiting on pins and needles for Season 4 to start.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am disappointed that Ms. Day put aside her original plan to make this series a trilogy if she wasn't going to give us a great plot and an exciting story in Entwined with You.  As written in this poor excuse for a book, the increasingly dysfunctional characters have become ridiculous, boring and mundane.  And, we all know Ms. Day can write a great sex scene, but dozens of them gratuitously strung together do not end up as a great read. Sorry, but I think I'm done with Gideon and Eva.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok this is good and all put now the ipod has the update PLEASE PUT UPDATE TO KINDLE FIRE I REALLY WANT TO HAVE THE NEW UPDATE!:0
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like everyone else here I have been looking forward to the last book in this trilogy, it's horrible that Sylvia is going to milk this story for more money.  There is no way I will spend $50.00 on these books, too bad, it was a good story but there is no need to drag it into five books.
B00CRW2066|3.0|I write this with sadness, because The National is a favorite band who has produced 3 of my all-time favorite albums. But this one sounds like self-parody. Nothing new, no development - which are forgivable flaws - but also no depth - which is not. Years ago when they first sang a woman's name, letting us know we were listening to an conversation, it was thrillingly intimate. Now, with names woven frequently into the verses, it sounds like a gimmick. Their performance on Colbert promoting this album was revealing in that the song they chose was terrible and they didn't seem to know it. And yet, I have kept \\"Trouble\\" in my playlist for a few weeks now and keep trying. Hey, it's The National: I really want to like it. I just haven't figured out how.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Can not wait for a sequel.  Very easy to get emotionally invested in all the characters.  I want to know how the future played out.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|First of all, this book was designated as a trilogy.  Last time I checked, trilogy meant three.  The problem with this is that not all of us knew that the author changed her mind shortly before Entwined With You was released.  Not everyone follows Sylvia Day of Facebook, Twitter, etc. to have heard that news.  I do follow the author on Facebook and the first I heard that this series was now changed from a trilogy to five books, was in the customer reviews on Amazon.  The readers have a right to know what they are purchasing.  Not everyone wants to read and get involved in a series.  This may be due to time, money, etc. but regardless, not everybody is up for that.  We should be informed and thus make our decisions for purchase accordingly.  next thing you know this is going to be like a Beth Kery series with 15 or so books that never end.  At least she charges less, at $1.99.  Sylvia Day charges a hefty $9.99 per Ebook.  I knew this was three books and I was okay with that.  But, I am not okay with it now being stretched to five and being $50.00 in the whole to get a resolution we were told we would get two books ago.  I do believe this has to do with Lionsgate and this turning into a t.v. series.  Coincidentally,this change happened shortly after. Hmmm...If that is the case, then I firmly believe Sylvia Day sacrificed her writing, this series, Eva & Gideon's story and her LOYAL fans for the sake of something she feels is more at this time.<br /><br />Secondly, this has now turned into QUANTITY versus QUALITY.  We are getting the quantity but not the same quality as the first two books.  I would rather have one good book versus five mediocre books.<br /><br />I purchased this book and gave it a try.  At first I told myself I was not going to.  Well, unfortunately I did.  I had to stop.  From what I read, there is unnecessary drama and character focus to fill the pages.  Fillers, fillers, fillers!  And Eva...what happened to her?  I did not like her in this, nor didI feel she was worthy of Gideon.  Wow!  I feel like there was a little character destruction.  As I stated, I stopped and asked for a refund! A refund!  I have never done that!<br /><br />Honestly, I respect others opinions but I do not know how anyone gave this above a three.  I feel that the people who did, did it out of loyalty to the author and series versus honestly reviewing the content of the book.  Sure, we could give Gideon a 5 star rating for himself.  We could give the sex a 5 star.  But, that is not what this is about.  It is about everything, from price to adding more books and being mislead to the story to the characters to the resolution to the...<br /><br />This series will end for me with the completion of the first two books and a partial, unsatisfied read of the third.  You have disappointed me Sylvia Day, a loyal fan of the series until now.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Not sure how I missed this show when it originally aired, but I absolutely love it!  One of the best police shows I've seen.
B000GT6KEU|5.0|Good casting and a great score.  Have watched several times and will watch again.  Not for the young (contains a number of very adult themes) still a terrific overall adaptation of a great musical.
B008MM9630|5.0|A really addicting game! I cannot get enough of this game with all the options, especially all of the animals!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A very good description of a woman with a personality disorder and the devastation she wreaks on others lives. Great for Book Club discussions. There will be varying opinions on the characters.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I'm not familiar with Grissom's work, but I found this book engaging with strong characters and enough action to keep the reading exciting. As yet another story about the deep South and slavery it does a good job of telling it in a new and different way.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|What do you do with thousands of ancient 35 mm slides collecting dust in the cupboard?  Years ago I bought an expensive, well-made Nikon slide scanner but it was hopelessly inefficient.  I quickly gave up.  This little DB-Tech scanner on the other hand has been a revelation.  It takes photos of the slides that you can review on a small LCD screen and with a push of the button stores the rsulting image on an SD memory chip that you must supply.  One can process ten slides or more a minute.  In a couple of evenings I have gone through over 1,000 slides, discarding about 75% of them.  The resulting digital images are perfectly acceptable for home use.  The only drawback with the product is that the small switches used to operate it are relatively flimsy and I am relatively heavy-handed.  I managed to break the on-off button with three pushes on the first one that I bought (One star deducted for that.) .  I returned it and am awaiting the credit from Amazon.  In the meantime I bought another one because it is so dazzlingly efficient and easy to use.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I saw it at the theatre when it came out but I wanted to see it again and share it with my friends at home.<br />The quality on my TV was very good and we all enjoyed it at home.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I thought Kiss of Snow was her best book, but I think this book eclipsed that one and all my expectations! I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't finished the book or even started. I was left with only one thought when I read the last word.......\\"WOW!\\" If you like Nalini' s books AT ALL then you don't want to miss out on this one.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Recently Amazon restock this for $35 and I only managed to grab one. The movie itself is great, but I bought this mainly for the broken cowl( since I already own a copy of it). The broken cowl is well made and very detail. Every Batman fan needs to own one of these.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I enjoy these types of puzzle games that start out slow to let you get the hang of the game and then increase in difficulty. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great game to pass the time.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I enjoyed it. This was my first time seeing it, I expected a bit more jungle actionand scenery, but the movie and story was great so<br />overall it is a good movie. The TV quality was great very good colours.
1426308469|5.0|This is a good second book about dinosaurs for little kids after Dinosaur A-Z. We bought both books at the same time and can see that our great granddaughter will grow into this book very soon. It contains helpful pronunciation assistance and size comparisons as well as interesting information about each dinosaur including what it eats and when it existed. The book is arranged by size allowing children to easily find the dinosaur they want to share with others. It's very rewarding to learn about dinosaurs along with our great granddaughter and discuss what we are learning. A very good choice!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The app was free which is even better but the quality of the light was great and easy to use.
B009GO8APS|5.0|Awesome, a must have movie in your collection, great action, evenly paced. Special effects were believeable , actors pulled it off.  Real sweet movie I recommend this to any one. The 3d just pops out at you.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Me and my sister have both got this game, but hers seems to get higher scores quicker. Mine would be 10...20...30, but hers would be 100...200...300 other than that, amazing game :D x
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|At first look, it's a very good deal for the price, everithing is okay but the screws ... there are 9 screws that are attached to the frame with a poor quality aluminium nut, since you need to play around finding the balance .. you have the risk of damaging one nut easily. I've lost the one that keeps the plate in place in the Second Day of trying to get the DSLR balanced  .... So think about another option!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Using Win 7 and Galaxy Note 2 and so far, it works great.  Easy to setup and use. Connect over 3G and the speed is not bad at all.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Well written and understandable exposé of the wheat business and the medical consequences of eating today's genetically engineered wheat. Read it for yourself.
0739358049|5.0|I enjoyed this book on tape very much, I needed to read it for school, but I ened up loving it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Just as good as the first one. I hate so many characters but I love around half of them too even some considered evil which is a nice balance in a book and the way it should be
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It's now like looking for a \\"Made in the USA\\" tag - I will now be looking at books to see who published it. I will not buy another Penguin Publishing book OR another book from Day. She chose her publisher, she chose her fate.<br /><br />Thankfully I did not buy this book. I downloaded the sample and was stunned at how many times you can say I love you to one person - and I was FULLY aware this was a romance novel. I was BORED in the sample!!! After reading all of the reviews on how Eva is thinking about someone other than Gideon and other random focuses. When you say you are doing a trilogy, do a trilogy. I get that your publisher set the price to rip us eReaders off but again, you chose this publisher. Go buy a oublic relations expert because you just died with your Its a trilogy but just kidding its not over for 2 more books. Write a novella or another story, charge me what other writers that are just as good as you, don't cliff hang your LOYAL followers who have been waiting MONTHS for rubbish,  and I will think about giving you another chance Sylvia.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this book for MONTHS. It is as if Christmas has been canceled. RIP Gideon. You were too good for Eva anyway.<br /><br />#\\"Finished with you\\"
B009CUWG06|5.0|Being a Ken follett fan for a long time I am thrilled to have this book, and look forward to the other two parts of the triligy.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|It is his style of writing that I find unique, as well as his storylines and plots that have many twists and turns so that you can't always predict what is coming.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wonderful app for reading anywhere you go!<br />Functions great on Android phone.<br />Books load quickly , easy to navigate the app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never have I been so addicted to a TV show until Downton Abbey! I love every episode! Thank you for providing such an amazing series!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG, this was a long awaited sequel and it was well worth the wait.  After all the drama in Reflected in You my angst was at an all time high.  I spent the majority of the book on pins and needles so afraid that Eva and Gideon were heading for some very, very dark times.  I like the way this installment played out and I am once again anxiously waiting for the next installment.  Following Eva and Gideon's journey is a treasure to immerse myself into.  These two have me feeling so many emotions.  Crossfire, I just love me some Gideon!!!!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This book came highly recommended.  I found it slow, boring, and long. Some parts were interesting, but they were watered down by the parts that were hard to get through. Not my favorite.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Twists, and turns, heroes and villains.  Harry Bosch is none of the above.  Just a man, who happens to be a cop, who lives, breathes, loves, hates.  But, above all, is human.<br />But, Connelly makes you stay up until 3AM to see what Harry Bosch does, never cheat's you, never makes any fantastic 007 escapades to escape or capture (or kill) the bad guy.<br />Be it the first Harry Bosch or the tenth one you've read, you never are disappointed.  (And, you get some free jazz history thrown in for good measure!)
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This movie kept you guessing till the end.  Great storyline and performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.<br />My wife and I both loved it!
B003QSJVV2|5.0|Have to see this every year or so! Nicolas Cage need we say more! I should just buy it!<br />Thanks Amazon
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I hadn't seen the movie yet when I picked this book up.  I have to say that I enjoyed the book much more when I finally saw the movie! It is quirky, heartbreaking and funny.  May have to read it again!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A delightful movie. I don't usually like owen wilson in most movies, but he was great in this one. He said his lines with the precise inflection and tempo that Woody would have used. Brilliant. This movie will grow on you.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Ordered this movie for my monthly movie party. Mama does not disappoint. Full of unsuspecting frights, awesome special effects, and great acting, this is now a fave movie of mine!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|could be a little better if the tiles where larger as older people have eye strain problems but on the kindle I guess its ok
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found the beginning of this book rather hard to get into, but about a quarter of the way through it hooked me and I coulnd't put it down.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|This album is very solid, and I greatly enjoyed it. The riffs are heavy, the solos are exciting, and the lyrics are much more to heart than political. I give a lot of credit to Dave Mustaine for trying some things different, this Megadeth album is a more diverse offering than previous albums. For instance the banjo intro on \\"The Blackest Crow\\" and the bluesy guitar on \\"Don't turn Your Back...\\"<br /><br />Personally I was hoping this album would have been a bigger step forward. Every \\"new era\\" Megadeth album has seemed to take a step forward in bringing the band to a new level. Thirteen and Super Collider both stand still on the path, as they repeat what the band has already done and continue to do the same thing. By no means should you not consider this album though! Any Megadeth fan will like this album, just don't go in thinking your getting Peace Sells or Risk 2.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love having this to play while traveling or doing something else cause i have on my home computer would recommend to others
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|grandson likes playing this and my granddaughters are good at it to but little out of my type of gaming
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Much more then expected. American Gods..Money, instant gratification, technology. Old God's forgotten, wanting to be remembered. Very thought provoking. Loved every minute  and loved the mythology.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This album is as fantastic as it is intriguing. The entire album is eerie, exciting, and beautiful. The sound of this album is nearly impossible to explain, but encompasses everything Josh Homme and QOTSA have ever done. But, it feels new and refreshed with vitality from another dimension. Truly this album is a masterpiece of new age rock music, so get this album and found out for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
0679805273|5.0|My daughter just graduated from college Suma Cum Laude - This book is relevant to students of all levels of education. It can be inscribed with thoughtful & congratulatory wishes, dated , and thus kept as a keepsake from the student's &#34;Special Day&#34;.

B001UGB1X8|4.0|Believable story, enjoyable for movie night in front of the computer. Pass the popcorn. Another good choice for instant Video and Prime
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great book by this author.  Love this series, and was so thrilled that it will not end with 3 books.  Gideon and Eva's story deserves more time to play out.  Cannot wait for book #4, just hope that we don't have to wait another year like with this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|You get tired of it nobody is playing this anymore it's gone from up to down people are playing IORN MAN 3 which is better than this Old GAME

B000NWLO6O|5.0|Found it to be a very exciting book. It was suspenseful and reflected the time of the &#34;cold war&#34; quite well.
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|New to me very good music anyone who likes seether and breaking Benjamin will like this so if you are debating just buy it
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I have read so much of James Altucher lately that this book is like the cherry on top of the shake.<br /><br />I suppose that I am biased but that is what a good author does: they persuade you.<br /><br />They persuade you to agree with their views.  Or at least to consider them.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to have \\"chose myself\\" about two years ago.  Since then I have never looked back.  I am grateful for what I have learned on my journey.<br /><br />I find myself nodding in agreement through this entire book, but I also gained a few key insights.<br /><br />James has a few core concepts and some of them overlap quite nicely.  For example, the idea that the middle class is dying combines nicely with his dislike of college.  So far I have not used my Bachelor's degree from college but because I chose myself I have banked six figures twice over (as a side project no less, not from a day job!).<br /><br />This guy is an idea machine and he outlines a very practical method for turning yourself into one if you so desire.  I know it works because I essentially follow a variation of his daily practice myself, and have been doing so for at least two years now.<br /><br />I hate to be such a fan boy of this dude but he is just so darn smart, prophetic, and helpful.  Oh and in addition he happens to be a really nice guy as well.<br /><br />But don't get his book because he is nice.  Get it because you cannot afford to miss out on these ideas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absoutly love it and its already updated on my ipod but when will we get the update for kindle?
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Very entertaining, addictive. It was a little slow at first, I thought it was my connection with the internet. Worthy, yes!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I've read the first book which corresponds to season 1 and this is an amazing visualization of this fantesy world. Very entertaining.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|These DVDs are well worth it.  Good family show, which you cant say about a lot of shows these days! I am now the owner of all 5 seasons and will miss watching it on TV every Friday night with my kids.  Sorry to see it end.  Enjoy from the beginning.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The introduction to the book is totally unique - the author describes in detail how he created the character for the book/series.  A very interesting addition to a good read.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Well, what can I say about this apart from the fact I am really disappointed.<br />I don't see the point in the book to be honest. There doesn't seem to be a story line running through the book. In the first book it was the story of them getting together and dealing with jealousy. The second book was all about Nathan. The third feels more like the first book in a series than the third. It's setting up a number of different story lines to keep the story going and if this was the first book in the series then I could understand it but not for the third.<br />I won't be investing in the next 2 books. Sorry.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|My girls and I would watch this show every Friday night and couldn't wait for it to come on the next week.  Great family show, my nine year old loves it, she actually started watching again from season 1. We will miss it, but can always watch now on DVD
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I love every movie by this director. Great actors, story, and cinematography. Kept me on the edge of my seat!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|LOVE AVENGERS, THIS MOVIE ROCK, SEEN IT @THE MOVIES AND WATCHING AT HOME... OVER AND OVER... YES I RECOMMEND. HULK SMASHED BUTT IN THIS ONE!!!
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|My family and I are fans of Merlin and have watched from the first season.  I am glad that I will now be the owner of all five seasons.<br /><br />Enjoy with your kids
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My kid loves Lego ninjago and all the products are excellent and work ...they spend lot of time playing and enjoying the toys.
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|THE INNKEEPERS<br /><br />I am a big fan of ghost movies mainly because I think they really exist and I have reason for thinking that. That all is another story for another time but as of right now I am talking about \\"The Innkeepers\\", which was a really good film by \\"The House of the Devil\\" director Ti West. Now I did like that film and West's style so I was pretty sure I would like this one. Thankfully I was not disappointed and this was another good flick by West.<br /><br />Claire and Luke are clerks at an Inn that is going out of business. We join them during the last week of the establishment's open doors. Luke has a site and an interest in the paranormal and it just so happens that that is place of work is indeed haunted. So he and Claire decide to do some investigating before the place closes. A woman once killed herself there so things seem to go bump in the night.<br /><br />An excellent reviewer named Woopak said in his review that this film is a \\"slow burn\\" and he could not be more right. This film slowly builds and in that sense feels like an old school movie haunt flick. I have to say that Ti West really did a good job here with that, the characters are interesting and a little odd. His direction and writing style are refreshing in the world of jump scares that seem to hit screen after screen. Now not everything works out but that will come later.<br /><br />The performances here are great and kinda played a little on the quirky side, especially the two clerks played by Sara Paxton and Pat Healy. Both are excellent here with Sara in particular playing Claire a little off or something, love it. I love quirky women so I was all about her here. Kelly McGillis is great as well here as an actress/psychic who I am glad got a good amount of screen time.<br /><br />Now I mentioned earlier that this is not a perfect movie and the reason being is that the ending to me felt a little underwhelming for lack of a better word. That wasn't the word I was looking for but it will work. Now I won't ruin it for you because you may disagree with me which I hope you do. But I did like the little \\"subtle\\" thing during the last shot, so much so that I didn't really notice it at first. A few people who watched it with me [two] noticed it but I missed it the first time. I am sure most know about it by now but there is something there.<br /><br />This was a really well done movie and had that old school fell to it. I really enjoyed the commentaries on this disc and the special features. I do recommend this film but know that it is not your typical horror film. But if you stick with the film there are some genuine creepy/scary moments.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I won't bother describing this movie or why it's probably my favorite Disney movie - Many other reviews will gladly tell you, and I'd think you'd be buying this Diamond Edition because you've already seen it. This review focuses exclusively on the Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />The discs come in a very nice-looking case. It was much smaller than what I expected, but there's nothing wrong with that (I'd say it's for the best, there's not much room around the house anyway). It comes with a cardboard sleeve, with excellent shiny artwork. The art on the plastic case itself it's the same as the sleeve. Just as pictured.<br /><br />The disc boots to some (skippable) previews, and a menu appears, allowing you to choose between French, English or Spanish (Latin American spanish, not European). I checked the spanish option, and it automatically set the movie to play with the dub, the special features are subtitled (the bloopers are dubbed) and all of the menues are in spanish. I'd assume it's the same with French. English should be pretty self-explainatory.<br /><br />I decided to check the movie, and it looks phenomenal in HD. Every detail is visible - from the twinkling stars when Mufasa teaches Simba his lesson to practically every leaf, branch and grass blade through the movie. The colors are excellent, too. The audio was also quite great. (I can't really comment, since I don't have a surround system and have to rely on the TVs built-in speakers for the moment, but it sounded pretty good anyway.)<br /><br />The special features include &#34;Pride of the Lion King&#34; and &#34;The Lion King: A Memoir&#34;. Both detail the making of the film, but &#34;Pride&#34; also includes details on adapting the film to a Broadway musical. Other features are animated bloopers, an interactive gallery detailing Character sketches and model sheets, backgrounds and story, deleted scenes that include Scar trying to make Nala his queen (which was later adapted into the Broadway musical) and a song about Mufasa, and the &#34;Morning Report&#34; deleted song.<br /><br />There's also the &#34;Disney Double Screen&#34; (or something along those lines), which requires another device (such as an iPad, I guess). Unfortunately I don't own anything like that, so I couldn't check it out. There's also the Disney Vault, which as far as I know requires BD-Live (My player has it, but no internet - shame on me!)<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this Blu-Ray is a sucess, and I am proud to say The Lion King is the very first Blu-Ray movie I have owned. I'll check out other Disney Blu-Rays to add to the collection.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Bought this for a great price. No complaints, and please do not pay attention to the negative reviews. Happy with purchase.
145210655X|5.0|Lovely, interesting. The relation of a Darth Vader and Luke as should have been if they where together. Not only for Star Wars fans but specially made for us.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS, ASSUMES YOU HAVE SEEN SEASONS 1-6, IS A LITTLE LONG, AND DISSES CSI!<br /><br />Well, we recently watched S7 over the course of 3 nights.....we don't know about most viewers but Dexter is one of only a few shows that we simply cannot watch 'old school' (ie. 1 episode per week!?  Just can't do it!!).  After what was easily the worst season last season, despite the excellent cliffhanger and the regrettably brief period Mos Def was a part of the show, we had fears that Dexter may be sputtering to its close in season 8.  Thankfully, S7 is probably our favourite since the first 2 and may be a contender for best season to date.  Many reviewers seem to have been disappointed with S5 (some specifically negative of Julia Stiles; not quite sure what the problem was there, she was great).  What WAS an issue in S5 & 6 was the writing that tended to treat the fans like cretins (something we refer to as CSI writing; when something is needlessly explained multiple times in case you were too dim to get it the first time!).  This is fine for mediocre shows like CSI, NCIS, and the rest (and if you think those shows are well written then a level of contempt is probably justified), but this is not good for a supposedly intelligent show like Dexter (eg. a character refers to Rudy and then another character says the ice truck killer or Dexter's internal monologue says 'my brother'.  We are fans of the show.....we KNOW Rudy is the ice truck killer and is Dexter's brother......please stop treating us like morons.....there are plenty of shows that do that already.  S7 is almost completely devoid of this and we are forever grateful.<br /><br />We always knew that if this show lasted a number of seasons that eventually the story line would turn to the prospect of Dexter being in a situation that he will kill (or contemplate killing) an innocent, either by mistake or to protect himself (and by doing this you risk alienating the core reason for why this show is so special....you're rooting for the serial killer!  But how can you continue to do so if he kills the innocent!?).  This prospect isn't new to the show as it happened with Doakes in the first 2 seasons but with S7 it went to a place that will make it impossible for the show to have a happy ending.....and if the writers are true to the Deb character.....it's an act that she would never forgive herself for.  As much as we want to see the last season.....we also don't!<br /><br />The significant pro's for S7 were the introduction of the Stevenson and Strahovski characters (not bad considering Ray's acting is generally a little stiff and we're not big fans) but with even more focus on the 2 main characters of Dexter & Deb it is no surprise that this was a much improved season.  As good as Michael is as Dexter, Jennifer is absolutely astonishing; and their performances and chemistry are the shows greatest strength....and is there an actress in TV today that can do 'emotion' better than Jennifer!?<br /><br />Possible story developments for the last season?  Quinn getting set up for the murder of Maria (assuming Maria IS dead) since he's a dodgy cop anyway and did have it out for Dexter at one point; Sonya comes back? (unlikely, but we always thought the Irish nanny was too good to be true and was going to be a problem for Dexter); the best season yet for Angel Batista?  Hasn't had a lot to do over the last couple of seasons, was looking like getting written out for season 8 but now has almost been given the greatest reason to be a focal point of the last season.....delay retirement to hunt for Maria's killer (assuming Maria IS dead....sorry for CSI-ing that!); Strahovski's gotta be a big part of it you'd think.<br /><br />Dexter is truly a wonderful show with a great cast of almost universally likeable characters and isn't that what brings you back for more!?......Boardwalk Empire is likely a better show (technically) but who do you care about or root for!?  Here's to a final season that will leave fans satisfied although those expecting a happy finale are gonna be outta luck we think.<br /><br />Can't wait for 8.....and please don't CSI the writing......and thanks to everyone involved with bringing the show to the screen and for the fans big enough in number to allow it to run for as long as it has.....it is very much appreciated.<br /><br />Happy viewing!<br /><br />PS : shame it was shot on digital and more Vince, please!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I rarely right reviews.......but felt like I had to with this book.  Sylvia Day miscalculated by dragging this book out AND then, not finishing it!  I'm over this author and this series!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Here you have the continuation of Eva and Gideon's love story or a least it should be, the problems is that this book is full of erotic scenes and not enough story to move it along, which makes me wonder how are there going to be 2 more books.<br /><br />I feel this book actually changed my feelings about some of the characters, they now seem very immature and childish except for Gideon who is amazing in the book.  The story part didn't really get going until 60% of the book and then it was quick and not a very smooth transition.  I will not be buying the next books I will just wait until they come out in the library.<br /><br />This book could have been the end to a wonderful trilogy instead it has turned me off the story.  Ms. Day is a wonderful writer and that is the only reason I gave the book a 4 and my first negative review ever.  Ms. Day promises in her website the next book will be out quick and will be much better, let's hope that is true.<br /><br />I am glad that this summer I have Damaged 2 and This Man Confessed to look forward too.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Chris Kyle was a great American.  His descriptions of the battles for Fallujjah and elsewhere in Iraq are riveting.  He will be truly missed.
B00992CF6W|1.0|everything was fine till I went on today I still had all my items but all my buildings were gone and there were new cave dark things that weren't there before...REALLY MAD
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Couldn't finish it.  Totally sophomoric attempt at literature.  Stupid premise.  Grey seemed to appear at will with no sense of time and distance explained.  The gimmick of emails was maddening after awhile.  Pulp!!
B008K9SG9K|3.0|Most songs are good considering I only knew one of them in the first place when I bought the cd
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I love action movies.  There is one scene in this movie that is just awesome: Bruce Willis just walking out of a car that gets hit and *is still moving*!  But the lack of effort by the RED team - not one is breathing hard, no hair is messed up, no smudges of dirt on the face or the WHITE CLOTHING - tells me that no one took this movie particularly seriously.  It just did not do the action justice.  I doubt I'll see the sequel.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|This show is easily the best one on TV lately. The writing, directing and performances are great, Tatiana Maslany (the lead actress) portrays each clone perfectly. Sometimes I even think it's a different person! The rest of the cast is also great.<br />The plot is full of clever twists and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and eager to watch the next! I'd recommend this show to anyone that appreciates good drama, action, science fiction and clones :D .  The only bad thing is having to wait until next year to watch the second season... :/
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I've always wanted to read this.  Although it's very wordy, I'm enjoying it.  I have it on my cell phone Kindle app.
0425252868|4.0|Even in war, compassion will sometimes win.  Gave us very interesting details of the German hero and those he saved after that 10 minutes of compassion.  Enjoyed this book very much.
0307474259|5.0|This book was easy to read and filled with information debunking the accepted \\"science\\" on weight loss.  Most of the book covers the research and what it means verses what was said about it.  Points out many things that I noticed/experienced that contradicted mainstream teachings on weight loss.<br /><br />The appendix (short because it is so simple) covers a new \\"diet\\" plan that I have been on for over three months and with it have lost ~25 lbs and improved my health in other ways as well.<br /><br />I whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone looking to understand the subject and to really make a difference in their life.<br /><br />2013/06/07 - Wanted to add an update.  Just got results from my doctor. Besides losing weight, my cholesterol has improved as well as my blood pressure.  Maybe the diet this book promotes isn't for everyone but it has improved my life and health greatly - reduced weight, lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, no more heartburn, no more headaches... I hope everyone who tries this has as good or better results than I have.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys know how to put great music together! I thoroughly enjoy listening to everything on the CD - I also have the first CD and would recommend both. I love how they put contemporary and classical pieces together! Brilliant!
1401201911|5.0|Short and sweet, this is simply the best Superman story I have read, and I've read most of them. How does a socialist society based on \\"every man being equal\\" handle the concept of one man being super? That is just the first of many, many layers of meaning behind the story. It's deep, it's rich, and it's great from the writing to the art.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The parts shown during the movie trailer is the best parts. It seemed really long and we got bored watching it.
B00AEFXQ9S|1.0|Has a good meaning, but is drawn out and boring to the point I fell asleep twice.  I have attempted to watch it 2 with no avail!  I always fall asleep :(
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I started reading this series after finishing fifty shades of grey. I found I love this series a hundred times for than fifty. I love the dynamic of the characters and they're are some pretty steamy love scenes. I didn't discover this series until both the first and second books were out so I got to read them back to back. Now after waiting six plus months for this book it's bittersweet. I read this book in one day because I couldn't get enough of it but now I'm done and will have to wait who knows how long for the next one! This book cost more than the usual e-books I buy but it was completely worth it. Read it, fall in love with it, and re-read it!
B002LLE3Q8|5.0|I always thought COTCK sounded a bit murky on CD but that was alright as the album is so atmospheric the murkiness just added to the atmosphere. I found out they couldn't find the master mixdown tape when they pressed the CD so they used a second generation tape. Then they found the original master tape and remixed the album from scratch. This CD sounds great! How much do I love COTCK? I actually painted the song lyrics to the title track: http://thetooners-rocknrollrehab.blogspot.com/2009/03/neal-warner-portfolio.html.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I could not put this book down! Not a dull moment to  be had. So happy with the story, and the secrets that came out. And Kaleb is freaking hot. Whoo! Going to reread right now.
159463176X|3.0|I have read the first two books of Khaled Hosseini and loved both of them so I was looking forward to reading this book.  But when I finished it I felt a little bit of let-down.  It just didn't quite get there.  First it was hard to follow all of the different characters and time periods.  Some of the chapters go way, way off from the main storyline.  That's what I felt drawn to was the story of Pari and Abdullah.  I enjoyed reading it but it left me a little \\"wanting more\\" at the end.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|You and/or your children will fall in love with the Little Prince, and you'll be shown a new perspective on things. A joy to read, and lots to discuss and learn from.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is FANTASTIC - great for quick look-up - able to bookmark passages in as many versions as you like - They also offer wonderful daily devotions sent straight to your e-mail!
B004P1JEXE|5.0|As part of the saga &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34;, the fourth book &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; is another fast moving, well written and thoroughly time-consuming read.  Like every book in this saga, it completely takes you over and insists on your full attention.  If you are looking for a read that takes you on a long journey of human strengths, weaknesses, love, passion, hatred, revenge, compassion (in fact any of the human experiences), then make time to read this book as part of the complete set of &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34;.  You won't regret it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I began reading this book thinking I would not be too interested in it. I'm not a fan of fantasy really, or at least I wasn't! This book is so wonderfully written, it had me glued after chapter one.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a well done movie that illustrates how important a father is in their children's life and what a difference their love and support mean!
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|I really like this case. It doesn't add any bulk to the phone. Looks really good. Not cheap looking like some... Good job!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was supposed to be a Trilogy. I am asking for my money back . I was suppose to get the last book of 3 as advertised . Shame on you mrs. Day, you should let us know in advanced that there were going to be 5 books I feel betrayed. I pre-order the book weeks ago. I am so sad , sorry Mrs. Day.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|based on reviews and the myth of a trilogy.........i will save my money and re read the other TRILOGY i read a while ago.
0786869143|5.0|I actually read this book because everyone always comments on how \\"lucky\\" I am.  After reading the book I realized that I naturally have been doing EVERYTHING that \\"lucky\\" people do.  It's so cool.  I think the author is really on to something.  Read it!
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I got this app a while ago, and I decided to make this review because this horrible app is on the free app of the day! First of all, this app is VERY dangerous! It's a spy app, it can get into your device!! This gave me a virus, and it took a month to fix! Second of all, this app doesn't work. I was trying to guess Tobuscus, and it said &quot;is your character female?&quot; AT LEAST TWO TIMES!!!! And when the time was to show me the answer, it showed up with iJustine. No. You are incorrect. I tried about 6 times when it finally came up with Tobuscus.<br />PLEASE don't buy this app, it's for your own good. I enjoy the computer version better. Do not get this app, it's a total waste of money, it's not safe, and it's stupid. Thank you for reading.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|great dvd - already have purchased season 2 as well!! Only con is not enough episodes, season two has more episodes.
B004U9J9GS|4.0|A great read! I especially liked the parts on how to be a better chef at home. I will definitely think twice about what I order at a restaurant now.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It's hard to find good books that don't rely on sex and violence to capture their audiences. i enjoyed this book purely for the  joy of the read.  It was simple but the characters had depth.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not sure what to write about this movie.  Was okay, not sure that I will watch again.  Think it was over rated in advertisements
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Great drama in a clean wholesome manner!<br />The movies were not as good as the series and was the only disappointment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game and especially the graphics. It took me a while to get used to the 3d effect. Although similar to the first Temple Run, Temple Run 2 is actually quite a bit better.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Producer did a great job in portraying the nightmare that these people went through.  Bless their hearts that they were so strong and were able to come through this and tell about it.
B00CL6GAD2|1.0|Story line sucked, and veryyy boring, don't recommend this movie, money wasted! Looks good on the cover but don't be fooled!
B005USZYDU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Light and fresh. You never know what Grisham will come up with next. Great for vacation.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|enjoyed movie very much.  Huge Barbra Streisand fan.  Extremely funny parts throughout the movie.  will end up watching a few more times
B00992CF6W|3.0|When will the kindle minecraft update be here?it came on Apple devices by I have not seen it on my kindle yet. Please update the kindle fire minecraft app or I will delete the app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game! Taking care of your horse and competing is fun. I just wish there weren't so many pop up ads! :(
159463176X|1.0|The first 50 pages were filled with wonderful writing,heartbreaking characters that filled me with emotions that this was going to be a great read.  Then the story began to unravel,became disjointed and lacked the emotional promise of the first 50 pages. Very disappointing and unfulfilling.
0425263924|3.0|I knew nothing about the upcoming 2 books being added to this 3 book series until this afternoon thanks to the Romance Forum Posters.<br /><br /> My book was pre-ordered, and it was in my mailbox today:)<br /><br /> I have really enjoyed the journey with the H and h, and now I fear with the extensions into 2 more books that the intensity could be lost, and what had promised to be a fabulous read for us has now become a storyline with a lot of \\"FILLERS\\" to keep the word count high enough for more books to be added to this series.<br /><br />I do not feel that this book has added anything pertinent to the storyline.<br /><br />Time will tell with the upcoming books hopefully being as wonderful as the first 2 books were.<br /><br /> I will continue to read this series because I am so invested in this couple that not reading the upcoming stories is truly not an option for me. I hope that the upcoming 2 books will stay as wonderful and as intense as the first *2* books were.
B000KIPT30|4.0|Behringer HA400 is a good quality, low cost option as a headphone amplifier. I use it in combination with my Macbook Pro and Apogee Duet for recording sessions in small settings where noise is a problem for the neighbors.The only drawback this unit has is keeping it stationary when multiple headphones are plugged in. Other than that I would definitely recommend the HA400 because of the sound quality, sturdy construction and price.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book is the best Clancy book I've read in years. Intertwined plot that you keep wondering how it will work itself out·
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun to play but you do need to invest in the family pack to really enjoy. Not a<br />bad investment for the hours of fun you can have!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love Charlaine Harris and all her characters - especially Sookie.  This one is the last Sookie Stackhouse novel and it just isn't up to Harris's usual standards. - it took the easy way out.  Nevertheless, buy it and read it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Good Greek mythology because of  it's fun and cool Greek and Roman mythology that is why I like this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A very addicting and fun game. Trying to get all the unlockable. I like the different cities every month. Keep up the good work
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book the writing always keeps me into it as do the characters. I do wish they had sex less and more dialog so that more content could have been added but I am in love with the series so it didn't really matter to me.<br /><br />In this book Eva and Gideon have grown a lot and they are acting a lot more mature which I love. Eva took off her running shoes and uses her mouth now (in more ways then one) which I like because they are communicating a lot better.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great movie. Should have won more awards singing was some of the best I have heard in a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun, exciting, thrilling, awesome. The layout is great, the scenery changes so it doesnt get old. The way that the coins work seem reasonable, and the way that you can unlock characters and buy characters gives it a boost. When you have to \\"surf\\" to reach a higher multiplier gives it a purpose, to get more plays out of it. Its a really good game to play.
B005HED08I|5.0|This remastered version is clean and crisp with great color and sound. I recommend this product as a wonderful addition to your collection.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Again Nicholas Sparks out did  himself.  This was book that I recommend to each woman, it makes you stop and think would be able to do this too.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Great movie. :D very good story. some comedy was needed to keep it going. :D definitely glad i bought it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What an amazing book.  I couldn't put it down. After slogging through 50 Shades of Crap, Life of Pi is a breath of fresh air  It called up so many emotions in me.  I cried, I got angry, I got sad.  Not since &#34;The Power of One&#34; have I sobbed like this while reading a book.  It's beautifully written!
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Saw the move when it first came out and liked-went to the movies to see the thats out not. Its good also
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun cool and entertaining it provides me with something to do and I'd really fun fun it is an addicting game
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />I've waited up until this point to read Les Miserables. I alwasy shied away from it in highschool and college. Then after I graduated college, I kept putting it off as I was daunted by the sheer size of the book.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited until I was older to read Les Miserables (I'm 32). I'm also glad that I waited until I had the time to really read the book. To digest it, to think about it, to compare it to present day. I don't think I would have been able to completely digest the story reading it in a rush for a class or being busy stressed out with college classes. I'm also glad I read it on my Kindle. I have a pretty hefty vocabulary but even some of the vocabulary in this book was difficult for me. I was nice being able to have the instant dictionary on the Kindle when I needed to check a word. If I would have read it as a regular paperback, i would have blown past the words I didn't know, guessing what they meant by how they were used in the sentence structure.<br /><br />This is indeed a masterpiece. One of those books that will stay with me forever. The letter from Victor Hugo to a publisher in Italy is amazing as well. There was so much to correlate between 19th century France and the US of today.<br /><br />Nothing I can say about the book can do it justice. It's just amazing in every single way. The way Victor Hugo writes is so eloquent and vaulted. It's poetry in novel form.<br /><br />I's amazing...
B008PUF3VS|5.0|My daughter recommended this book to me, she had seen the movie. It's very moving - I just loved it and would highly recommend it.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|When I was a little girl, my mother took me to Brussels. Before then, I had only known factory made American chocolate and while a Hershey bar is good in a pinch, for halloween, or to reminisce, it's really not...chocolate. In Brussels, I was introduced to chocolate. Real chocolate. The kind that is broken down and made by hand from scratch and love - and, not just love of serving people but love of chocolate. Every morsel of chocolate I devoured was a sensation; life changing. And, I was hooked.<br /><br />I caught myself wanting to spend more time in the kitchen with Vianne, wanting to learn her secrets to chocolate. Many people don't realize how beautiful and emotional chocolate is until they have experienced fine chocolates; chocolates that have been made by hand, not a machine. This book does a great job at describing the complete satiety that comes from good, hand made chocolate. The comfort, the fulfillment, the happiness, and gratification that comes from chocolate. It's all there, in this book...ready to be devoured!<br /><br />The characters are well developed and the storyline is well done. I don't find that the chapters jump around too much - although I did have to catch myself a couple times when I realized I was reading as the priest.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The descriptions of chocolates will make your mouth water and will make you set out on an excursion to find fine chocolates...or maybe that was just me?
B006R1T40I|2.0|Disappointing CD.  Half the songs would work well for background funeral home music.  No vibrancy, no quick beat, nothing to make you want to go pedal to the metal or get up and dance.  Save your money and buy her earlier releases.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I do not know how to play it, and there are no instructions that I can find.  Would not buy
B0051GY0LS|5.0|Very good and keeps you bounded to the end , it is a must read for all .go out and buy the book .
B0019IB0II|4.0|Very interesting!  A great book for anyone who is taking care of a person, or has close family or friends that have suffered a stroke.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It's just another run-of-the-mill awkward comedy that attempts to use crude, awkward, or shocking humor to get a laugh.  As the movie progresses, the situations become even more odd and awkward.  There really isn't a great conclusion to the movie, either.  No happy, feel-good ending.<br /><br />Parents may appreciate this movie more, having gone through some of these circumstances.  And there were some funny parts.  But all-in-all, I wouldn't bother to watch this one again.
0307476073|5.0|So obviously a true story.  No one could dream up all of the adventure she experienced.  I felt like I was on the trail with her the entire time.  She did a grat job in conveying both pain and blatant hunger to the reader.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Talk was not quite what I'd expected, a review of the book, but an even greater lesson that so much more can be accomplished with and for the homeless.
B0041OOEJY|4.0|i love the movie and its comedy but seriously???? why is it called the karate kid???? i mean their in china learning kung fu but whatever i think it still an amazing movie!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome!!! Everybody must get this app if you don't you are missing out on a great game it is so cool.
0811879542|5.0|I can't wait for my granddaughter to move to town in 3 weeks so I can read it to her!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Crazy fun once you get the hang of it. Would like a reset button to reset the game faster after a crash, but otherwise lots of fun.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|If you love horses, you will love this movie! It's a favorite of mine and will remain one. Enjoyed enough to watch over many times.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Loved this book, first one I've read by Jared Diamond.  Great anthopological perspective.  I loved the linguistic perspective he added to his history.  There was one chapter at the end where he was slightly too technical, but overall easy to understand for laypeople and a great perspective on what makes our current world what it is today.  My only disappointment is that there wasn't enough background information on the Fertile Crescent area.
B003L77FYS|4.0|The story continues. If you liked the previous seasons, you will like this one also. I am already watching season 4.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love SD. I love this series. This series is better than Fifty Shades of Gray. This is a better love story, better characters, better writing. I loved these books so much that I have read it more than 8-times over. I could not get enough of Gideon and Ava. Is this book good? YES! Is this book great? NO!<br /><br />I waited with baited breathe for what I thought was \\"supposed to be the final book in the trilogy\\" but I expected more.  I thought this was it for Gideon and Ava and I really wanted babies ECT.  I hope to see Ava's Mom and Dad reunite. I hope to see Cary happy. I hope a happy ending for all of the fantastic characters I have come to love...!It felt Ms. Day was running out of stuff to write, it felt forced in some places and too much over the top drama.<br />It was only towards the last few chapters that the book really got interesting. I am very disappointed that this is NOT the final book in the series but happy at the same time that we will see more of Gideon and Ava. I also hope the next book has more depth to it and it will bring a great ending to this amazing couple.<br /><br />I hope it will not be too long before the next book. Nevertheless, this is great series, Sylvia day is a great author, and I look forward to the final book (I hope)..? (sigh)
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I find it fun but not as good as temple run.  I do not like all the social networking they try to get you to do.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so addicting and it is super fun and makes time go fast a little faster than normal . I would recommend this game to one of your friends or siblings. That have a kindle ios or smartphone.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really like the last book of this series. It did tie up a few loose ends, but leaves room for more if Charlaine changes her mind about writing more.  I was disappointed in the ending of the book because I felt that it ended rather abruptly and it should have followed Sookies new relationship through just a little bit further.  Otherwise, it was a good read and up to par with the rest of the novels.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Since I installed this app on my Android phone. I have been able to read my books every where I go. I has never crashed on me or caused me any problems at all. I love it.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Not what i expected. some funny parts, but for being a &#34;sort of sequel&#34; to a fantastic laugh out loud movie, it was all but.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Very good game. Highly recommend this game to anyone who's got children and young adults. I intend to see the movie this is based on and taking my daughter to see it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This is a well-made film. It imposes some of our modern sensibilities on a very different age, but otherwise very good.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Have read all of Grisham's legal thrillers and this one did not disappoint either except one disappointment in writing.  It appears that writers are picking the bad habit heard in public, TV and movies.  Grisham does it early here.  A question is asked, &#34;Do you mind if.....&#34;. And the response is, Yes,.....&#34;instead of, &#34;No I don't mind.&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game to start but does get frustrating as you weave in and out of trains and other objects. Give it time and you will be climbing up the high score ranks. The neat thing is the game location changes giving you a feeling of a brand new game.  There are daily challenges and missions to increase your score as well as plenty of things to \\"purchase\\" in the store. You do not use real money but money that you earn from the game. Its fun to buy different characters as well as different game boosts. Totally worth playing and overcoming the learning curve.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|so lovely, exactly as I remember the fantastic movie, loved loved it, I play it constantly, it is haunting and sad sometimes
1475143389|5.0|I have worked out quite a bit and read a lot on the subject,  While many books of this kind are based on anecdotes and conjecture, this book relies more on science.  The author admits when there are varying opinions about different things but adequately explains why his advice is what it is.<br /><br />Like many others I emailed the author a question and got a very specific answer.  In fact, he asked additional questions so he could answer more completely.  Very happy with the purchase and nice to financially support someone who appreciates it.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|This is a great movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat!<br /><br />Good picture quality.  Just ordered another Daniel Craig movie!!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This has everything! Action, drama, comedy! I love it! Great job. I am hooked. I want to add that Allison is super hot! She is another reason I am hooked.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|It is a good action and adventure movie. It shows the risks and the dangers Bourne was willing to take in search of his identity. All his gifts and abilities, and all his money, could not make up for his need to know WHO HE IS.<br /><br />The application of the movie to our life is remarkable. It reminds me how empty and meaningless my life used to be before I found my identity in Christ. That's when I truly found myself. Until then, in spite of all my accomplishments, I had no idea where I came from (spiritually speaking) and where I was going. Just existing is not enough. We all need to know who we are, where we come from, and where we are going. What is the purpose of our life? Purpose gives meaning. The higher the purpose, the more meaningful our life is. Money, power, and people cannot fill the void in human life - the void of knowing who we are.<br /><br />Bourne was willing to go to extreme, not only to find who he really was, but also to free himself from the slavery of those who were using him as a killing machine, and to choose his own destiny and purpose in life.<br /><br />His companion, Marie, brings out the beautiful human side of Bourne. In order to protect her, he sends her away and gives her all his money. At the end of the movie, he looks for her and finds her running a successful business in a beautiful, paradise like resort area, by the sea. Their happy reunion is expressed with a beautiful embrace.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I know this has and ending, and only 5 seasons, which makes me mad because Sci-fi keeps coming out with decent shows then pulling the plug on them, following the footsteps of the BBC (cancelled Whites & Spy etc..) The show has a decent pilot that makes you interested, then it just gets better. It's a basic formula, new issue every week with underlying carried back stories. I won't go in detail since you can read whats the gist of it, but it's about a quirky genius-town where the protagonist (Jack Carter) is a sheriff and tries to hold everything together. In a town full if geniuses, Jack plays a related character to the viewer and goes through crazy situations each episode.<br /><br />I love all types of shows, and while the acting may not be there with this show, there's just something addicting about and can't stop watching each show after the next. Definitely worth a watch.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I read this on the recommendation of my wife.  Her son, my step-son, plans to take 4 months off from his job to do this trail!!<br />The book reads very well, demonstrating the dangers of being ill-prepared, along with a story of determination and a soul cleansing!<br />My &#34;son&#34; has become an experienced minimalist long trail hiker.  He hikes/camps in all types of weather and seasons, including surviving a serious major snowstorm in Yosemite while hiking a deep &#34;back country area!<br />This book is a &#34;must read for anyone seriously thinking of doing the &#34;PCT&#34;.  (Along with the other trail books mentioned in this one)<br />I gave it it's highest marks for the authors efforts and style were very enjoyable!!  My personal rating is &#34;A Great Read&#34;
B009TO99TG|5.0|My mother recently got obsessed with Coldplay, and she only had one CD. So, for Mother's Day, I got here these. She was delighted. It's a very good price, and the CDs are amazing :)
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show may be a bit gruesome for certain viewers, but it is smart and well done from the script and performances, to the direction and style. Very rare for me to want to pay for a Network show that I missed an episode of during its regular season.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|If you are one of the people who like Megadeth only for their first decade, you'll be disappointed.<br />This album is pretty much a hard rock album under the name of Megadeth.<br />As a fan who liked Megadeth no matter what they went through, I enjoyed this album. Sure it's not Rust in Peace v2 or Countdown 2 Extinction but it's is a record that's worth listening to. It has great solos done by both Brodrick and Mustaine accompanied by Ellefson's bass which could've got a bit more attention in the mixing. Drover's drums are just there - solid but not what Nick or Gar did on the kit. Pretty solid beat with a lot of double bass which can be killer if you use headphones. Dave's vocals are not as snarly as it used to be - they polished his vocals into a more cleaner tone. He still delivers and can get you the vibe you want.<br />This album is heavier than almost every record except Youthanasia and part of CTE. Almost every song (except Forget to Remember if I'm correct) is done in D tuning with a lot of power chords which produce a big beefy sound that's good for headbanging - Listen to the main riff of Burn! - after a small intro by Brodrick, Mustaine's vocals explode with a heavy beat that keeps you banging through the song.<br />===<br />Now to go through the songs:<br />Kingmaker is a good song with fast riffs and a more Mustainey vocals.<br />Supercollider which was bashed by critics is actually a good hard rock song - Forget that it's Megadeth for a second and you'll play it for a long time.<br />Burn! is one of my favorite tracks on this record. Killer riffs with great vocals.<br />Built for War & Off the Edge are good songs even though I didn't pay much attention to them.<br />Dance in the Rain is perhaps a good throwback to CTE. It starts slightly heavy and then gets a faster rhythm and finally finishes in a thrashy vibe that you get from songs like Set The World Afire. The ending of the song is one of the huge pros of the record.<br />Beginning of Sorrow has akiller bassline in the beginning. Moves on to some tapping solos by Dave and finishes off pretty strong.<br />Blackest Crow... The beginning will make you laugh. A Banjo on a Megadeth song? It's just for a bit so it's OK. Mustaine uses his VMNT as a slide guitar which has an amazing feeling in your ears! Just listen to the song's ending and judge for yourself.<br />Don't turn your back is the song that you feel like you're being preached to. Over all it has good riffs and the vocals are solid.<br />Cold Sweat is one of the best songs in this album. Originally by Thin Lizzy, Dave gave this song a more thrashy vibe and you have a great cover.<br />Booklet has some interesting reads in it - a lot of Vic inside!<br />Overall, if you like Megadeth, you SHOULD give this a listen. I can't say this is Risk 2.0 because Risk had it's moments. I can't say it's another Cryptic Writings because that album was just great. Listen to The Disintegrators from that record!! All I can say is this album is Supercollider - an album that if it was published by an indie band, it would've shot them to success. The only reason it's being bashed is because of us Deth fans and our high expectations.<br />I can only say thank you Dave for just being here and making music.<br />Well that was a bit long but worth it.<br />Slashing - Thrashing to Megadeth \m/
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This DVD is great family entertainment. It is enjoyable for adults as well as children. Product came as expected and we are very pleased.

B005FLX1HS|4.0|I love this album, I loaded it up immediately and I haven't stopped playing it. I am not really a fan of &#34;Breakin' a sweat&#34; or &#34;right on time&#34;, which is why I docked a star.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|you need peanuts for almost everything and even though safarying for animals is a great idea i would like to NOT have to pay for everything on it!  it costs money to do everything, including breeding. and there is almost nothing about it that has to do with dinosaurs!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is very addicting to many people. I spend most of my internet time on it, though tumblr is better. 'Nuff said.
B009RX8MQ0|3.0|I found Season 1 very captivating and riveting.  Season 2 does not even rate.  After watching brilliant shows like Game of Thrones, Suits, Justified and The Big C, it needs to step up to the plate.  Bring back the mystery and intrigue which is so lacking in this series.  I'm struggling to even watch the last few episodes.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it's fun at first, but keeps crashing!! I haven't even played since April!! And it's June!! Get it, but watch out.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I love this movie! It's not just one holiday spirit, it's all 5!! With such different and funny personalities, this makes a great movie for anyone. This movie is truly awesome.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I am an Austen fan.  This movie is 'cute' and funny.<br />.<br />( I was told this review needs nine more words.)  Here are at least that much.  This movie is good, but not good enough to gush on behalf of Amazon ! !
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game. Lots of things to collect. Facebook does a great job of sending out links for free gifts.lots of fun for the family and teams
B008JJM88Q|4.0|My Mom introduced me to this after playing with my nephews. It was cool for a little while and very impressive (though my Mom guessed my first attempt before Akinator did - probably because my Dad used the same character). Anyway, the light version was not very good, but I am glad to see this version as the App of the Day. My wife doesn't like it because she can stump the genie to easily. This will entertain you for a little while, longer for kids.<br /><br />For those of you concerned about the permissions, if it bothers you that much, just use the Web site instead. It is funny that they would have an app to pay for in mobile market stores when you can do it all for free on the Web site. This is what I had been using since I see no reason to pay for it.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It's pretty good but I don't think it is worth the money and is not super entertaining but still okay
B00ABO609A|2.0|This is a film that spans 10 years, but goes nowhere and very slowly at that. There are no dynamics, no drama, no one to care about. I was disappointed.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The writers of Castle really deserve a pat on their collective backs. Season five has focused on different characters in separate episodes letting the relationship between Becket and Castle simmer quietly in the background. As a result, the viewer has learned more about the supporting characters giving the plot more depth and enhancing the characters themselves. Then an episode will air that focuses once again on Becket and Castle's relationship. The entire season built nicely to the last episode. The viewer is left wondering not only about Becket's choice but also the affect her choice will have on the other characters. Basically, where will the show go from here? Nice cliffhanger...<br /><br />My only quibble is Castle himself. Becket's character has grown in complexity, and the writers, costume and make-up folks have consistently raised the level of her allure intellectually as well as physically. In fact, Castle keeps getting reminded by characters passing through the episodes that he doesn't know what he has in Becket. Castle's character is mellowing, which is fine, but his physically appearance is getting sloppy. He needs to hit the gym before Becket finds some of those one episode only characters more attractive than Castle with the viewers applauding her defection.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Great film that explores so many facets of human relationships juxtaposed with the struggles of mental illness! Splendid performances by Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence'
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|Beautifully acted and directed.  Never predictable.  Yossi's pain and redemption are depicted with deep feeling and a very light touch.  You gotta see this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't wait to see season 3!  This allows a continuity and no worries if I miss a single episode.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app was easy  to install and use, with great graphics. Also has video clips that played well. I would say it is better and easier than going to the web site on a pc.
0812973992|4.0|Thought this was very well written.  Interesting and very Dickensian in the way McCann had all these different stories he wove together and overlapped from different POVs.<br />Would recommend.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I am Still working on it. But always fun reading about thinkers and doers. Our world owes Tesla quite a lot.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Fun little game to play while killing time or doing something else, like watching something on TV that doesn't need your full attention.<br /><br />I really enjoy that I'm not timed [I play on the Adventure level], since I'm usually doing something else, or I might get interrupted.  There is a more competitive level where you can be timed, if you want.<br /><br />I believe the game is standard for these jewel type games, but if you are not familiar with them, this is it:  You are given a grid of tiles with different pictures on each tile.  The object is to switch two tiles that are next to each other to make rows or columns of three or more like-images.  When you do, the like-images will disappear, all the tiles above will shift into their place and new tiles will be added from above.  There are three counters on the left showing three different symbols and you have to make matches of those symbols until the counters are full.  Tiles also have symbols that aren't of the three that you are trying to get.  You can match them and get &#34;money&#34;.<br /><br />There are also impediments that make it a little more difficult as you progress through the game.  First you start with colors on the tiles that mean you have to clear that square multiple times.  This usually isn't that hard unless you get one in a weird position.  Then there are chains to break by matching the tile pictures that are a little more difficult because you can't move that tile until the chain is broken.  Also, the grid changes; it isn't always square, so some of the areas are harder to get then others.<br /><br />None of this is really hard, though, because, as you progress, you are given some extra tools to help eliminate tiles, like a thunder bolt that will knock out a bunch of tiles at once.  It &#34;costs&#34; to use these tools, but you &#34;earn&#34; money easily throughout the game and rarely need to use the tools.<br /><br />The game also lets you know where a switch can be made if you taketoo long to figure it out [this may only be in adventure mode].  And sometimes when you make a match and the tiles are shifting, the game also takes out some tiles that aren't related to the switch.  I believe it does this to make sure you always have future switches.<br /><br />In between playing the matching-tile games, you can help some people rebuild their village, but that really isn't challenging.  Cute, but not necessary.  Oh, and to &#34;open&#34; another area of the village to rebuild, you have to do a tile grid that IS timed, but if you don't get it done in time, you can just click on the box that says &#34;give me more time&#34; and then it's easy.<br /><br />All-in-all, an easy, but fun and addicting little game.  The graphics are really cute, too.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I really am enjoying watching the Columbo series. the only problem I am having right now is that some of the DVDs skip.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great story line, you get hook into it the first time. The interaction between the main characters is marvelous. Can' t wait to watch the next season.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What a great story, and still I want to know more.<br />Its good thats it doesnt have the happily ever after.. but I am still curious what will happen next.
B004RKXN44|5.0|This couple was long awaited and worth the wait. If love this series, you will be very pleased with the book. Hawke is a wonderful leader and alpha hero and Sienna holds her own and comes into her own in this book. There is a lot of tenderness and sense of looking in on  the very private emotional interaction of a couple that make this book so special. Because, it is a book later in the series, the dedicated readers get the joy of seeing all our favorite characters. I wouldn't rate this book as high if it was a stand alone but even if you have not read the series is is very good and would make your want to become a fan of the series.<br /><br /> If you like these themes, you should like this  book. Beware spoilers!<br /><br /> alpha-male, cat-shifter, children, close-family, elemental-powers, future, gifted-power, kick-ass-heroine, loved-forever,<br />mating, older-male, pnr, psychic,  shifters, soldier, tortured-hero, tortured-heroine, warrior, resistant-hero
0399162097|5.0|(This was an advance readers copy from the Amazon Vine program.)<br /><br />What a wonderful book. Do yourself a favor and read it now. Do yourself another favor and DO NOT look at any reviews or synopses of the book. Just read it. I don't know when I've read a book that was so filled with humanity and feeling. And if you've never read Karen Joy Fowler, this is a great place to start.

B00080ZG10|5.0|The movie let you know that wealth does not a happy human make.  Interestingly the broad scope of finances afforded to this extraordinary boring man.  Leo did an awesome job trying to bring personality to such a plain man.  In places in his life where he did not have to demonstrate \\"hoe like' clique, he fell right in same traps of those chased for their wealth.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book. Loved both! Wish I would have read it first though!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Complete sellout by the author.  Very disappointing.  Characters not true to originally developed parameters.  Complete waste of time and money.<br /><br />Shame on you, Sylvia! Your fans have waited for over a year for the \\"story\\" to continue.  If you simply needed 10.00 I would have sent it to you.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I choose five stars for this book because it was a really great life lesson and sweet and super fun to read. It was also touching and heart warming. I liked that August never was mean to the people that were mean to him he just handled it really well I would recommend this book to someone that loves great books that are touching and a little sad but overall great.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It was ok.. No big surprises or deep meaningful plots but good filler movie. Acting didn't suck and grandma has it going on haha
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We wanted to see this before the sequel comes out this summer.  The rental process through Amazon was easy for our first time.  Great movie for the whole family that didn't disappoint!
1444710338|5.0|There was an immediate weight loss and I so appreciated the explanation by the author of the nutritional value of this diet, so there was no worry about malnutrition.  I am a diabetic and my need for insulin has decreased by one-half since following this plan.  I am amazed at the constant weight loss.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to fellow diabetics with enthusiasm and because of the evidence of my weight loss and reduction of medication, I have been found credible.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game was was fun for a while but after after playing it got a little too mainstream.it got a pretty boring after a while and I have gone back to temple run.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I've never been big on zombie flicks but my husband convinced me to give it a try and I'm glad I did. \\"Warm Bodies\\" was a pleasant surprise. The central premise of the story is about a young male zombie simply known as R (played by Nicholas Hoult of [[ASIN:B000ICZCZS About a Boy]]) who despite his natural instincts to chow down on humans, rescues attractive zombie hunter Julie (Teresa Palmer). Thus begins a sweet, albeit unconventional love story of sorts as Julie's mistrust of the undead R gradually gives way to friendship and affection.<br /><br />I loved how the story blended horror elements with a love story and comedic bits. The leads were great especially Hoult who delivers a credible performance as the slacker zombie kid with heart who tries to come to terms with his inexplicable, against zombie nature romantic attachment to human Julie. This sexual attraction and affection for a human plays an important role in the story with far-reaching consequences in a post-apocalyptic world where masses of humans have been devastated by the zombie virus. Aside from the leads, the supporting cast also delivers fun and engaging performances - Rob Corddry as R's mentor/best friend is a hoot to watch, Analeigh Tipton as Julie's best friend, and John Malkovich as Julie's father and commander of the human army dedicated to eradicating the zombies.<br /><br />There really aren't scary bits in this film but the suspense quotient is respectable especially in scenes where the skeletors or boneys (zombies that are so far gone that they look like demonic animated skeletons) are on the prowl for victims. The story's central focus though remains the love story between R and Julie and it makes for a fun, and yes, sweet, sappy watch.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|I ENJOYED IT VEY MUCH. I HAVE OTHER VERSIONS OF JAN EYRE AND I HAPPEN TO LIKE THIS OE WITHWILLIAM HURT ALSO. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and Johnny Depp.  I'm a big time Dark Shadows (original) watcher, so I just couldnt wait to see this version.  I even saw some of the old cast in the movie, including Jonathan Frid (Barnabus Collins) before he went on to glory.
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|MANSFIELD PARK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.  I WOULD RECOMMRND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES TO WATCH MOVIES OF THAT TIME PERIOD. IT HAS A GREAT CAST AND STORY.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|It's Twilight. We all know Kristen Stewart can't act, and Robert Pattinson isn't far behind (or some of us are in denial). But I am a fan of shirtless Taylor Lautner, and I absolutely loved the books so I feel obligated to watch these. That and I hate owning some movies of a series and not all. I enjoyed the actor's performance who portrayed Riley, so this one wasn't a total loss. So yeah, it's Twilight.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Mr. King's books usually grab me from the first three pages, if not the first three paragraphs. According to Kindle, I was almost 30% through the book before it grabbed me. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, and was greatly rewarded with an awesome portrayal of what might have been . . . time travel never seemed scarier.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Here is another great, time wasting game from Rovio. I like the gravitational aspects and the enhanced character abilities. Good graphics!
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|I was expecting  Region 4 Dvds, as I live in New Zealand, but at least 2 of the people I bought for, can play DVDs from all regions. I have made the same mistake before, when buying from Amazon. Com. I feel there should be a &#34;box&#34; on order form, where we can indicate which number we need. It is an excellent movie, and I am pleased with it overall. I could not buy it in N.Z.<br />Mrs. B. McLean
B002AR5O6G|3.0|I got half way through the 30 days and stopped. Not because it was too tough, but because it just wasn't the workout I was looking for. I recently lost 45 lbs, and reached a stall in weight loss. I was looking for a workout that would tone and flatten my stomach, what I got was a leg-heavy routine, full of squats and lunges. I have to admit, I did feel the burn from this workout, it was tougher than my hour long routine at the gym in 25 minutes; however not in my abs. Not only that, but I lost no weight, and my stomach actually looked fuller to me. So I decided that I would try a different routine that has more cardio, but I will be keeping this video in the lineup for my strength training days.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Very on target as to what is happening in present day.  So scary.  If you have doubts as to what is behind current events, read this.  Very revealing but real.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|It has catchy songs, some meaningful inspirational songs. All very well written. Demi's voice is OUTSTANDING. Very good album. I'd recommend this to anyone. I'm very much impressed.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Absolutely the Best Film of 2012..hands down. I have seen a lot of them. Daniel Craig ,'M', and Javier Bardem really hold your total interest. PKW
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this as a free app for my kindle fire.i thought i would give it a try.that was about ten days ago...i cant put it down. Its far superior to that jungle run thing.much much more fun.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|We had not seen the previous version of this movie so we came into it without knowing what the story was.  We loved this movie.  It actually kept me and my 13 year old daughter riveted the whole time.  We highly recommend this movie.
193700788X|5.0|I'm firmly convinced that most of the negative comments about this book and the series come from people who love the Eric character and wanted Sookie to be with him at the end of the series. I'm sorry they are disappointed, but it's little reason to slam the author and accuse her of everything horrible they can think of just because they are upset.<br /><br />People like me who've read every book always knew Sookie would end up with her best friend, Sam. The best relationships are always between men and women who were friends before they got married. People who marry in the heat of the moment based on passion and sex often end up divorced when the fun is over and they find they have little in common with their partner. Sookie and Eric had nothing in common except a fierce physical relationship.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed the series and think each book has been a special experience. I don't feel cheated in the least and look forward to the upcoming follow up book about Sookie that is supposed to update fans on what happens with these beloved characters after \\"Dead Ever After\\".<br /><br />If you have decided to stop reading the series now, that's your choice, but take a moment to appreciate that not all of us are unhappy with the books and Sookie's choice at the end. I really hope to find out that she and Sam will be very happy together. Always.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This album is getting quite a bit of flak because it's not \\"Rust in Peace 2\\".  It's like the flak Metallica got when they didn't make \\"Master of Puppets 2\\". Of all the recent Megadeth albums, this one is by far the most solid and consistent. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Megadeth's catalog from \\"Killing is My Business\\" to \\"Risk\\"... I appreciate that Dave Mustaine is really adept at channeling rage and angst.. but there's only so many \\"Peace Sells\\" he can make before people start calling him a \\"one-trick-pony.\\"<br /><br />When you buy a Megadeth album, you get great musicianship, even in the drug-fog years. It's a given that Mustaine and Co. are perfectionists and not known for putting out duds. (Even \\"Risk\\", while experimental in places, was definitely Megadeth).<br /><br />If you read all the reviews, you'll notice that there is a theme with the negative reviews. I think most of them stem from one or two camps. The first camp is the group that hates Mustaine's political and religious views. Ignoring the fact that a great many of the \\"evil\\" musicians are cut from the same cloth as Dave, they can't get past the \\"Christian\\" label. That's not a good reason to hate an album. (I love King Diamond, but I couldn't care less that he's a Satanist...)<br /><br />The other camp is the more traditional group that yearns for the \\"Peace Sells..\\" era of Megadeth. I think this is just as heavy as that era, but some people are blocking their ability to enjoy this album solely based on nostalgia.<br /><br />If you're looking for \\"Peace Sells 2\\" or \\"Rust in Peace 2\\", skip this album and enjoy the first iterations of those fine recordings. But if you love Megadeth as a band, not an album, this is a perfect addition to your collection. Like all matters of taste, there is no argument... but if you get past the labels and the prejudice... you'll find a solid metal album.<br /><br />As a longtime fan of Megadeth, I can say this is a great album worthy of a listen and purchase. Don't let the haters fool you. (And this album, as a bonus, is mixed much better than \\"Death Magnetic\\")....
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Brings back the very original style when he first burst on the scene with &#34;The Firm&#34;. Quite literally could not stop reading and am already casting the movie in my mind.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This was one of the best movies made. There are not a lot of movies I can watch over and over but this one will never get old.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|im very desapointed,we waited a whole year for this book,and is not even close to the first 2 books,the first 2 I gave a 5 star,this one im giving a 1,i recommended this book for so many people,and now im ashamed,first Sylvia Day's books a wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to expensive,i love the author,but im done with her books,absurd,way to much money,and second this third book is HORRIBLE,no history,no suspence,nohing,is like reading a 3 pagesbook,only sex,nothing more,im very upset right now,i was VERY exiceted waiting whole year for this book and I just cant believe how bad it is,im afraid to purchased the next book ,I have the books and paper back and on kindle,i ispent $60 already,im not buyng the next one before the reviews,WHAT A CRAP,THIS BOOK IS
B0002XMKYE|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now I have my own copy to savor.<br />If your a fan of war movies or George C Scott you will love this movie
B00AHHODH2|4.0|The story was very interesting - even though you couldn't really take many of the characters or occurrences seriously.  It wasn't meant to be serious.  In any case, the story moved a little slow at first, but every chapter ended in a way that made you want to keep reading.  The twist is not completely shocking, but it's a twist.  There are more shocking twists that happen throughout the novel than the one at the end.<br /><br />I must say, however, that what made this seem more like a soap opera is the fact that there were too many coincidences that took place all over the world and were all centered in the small town of Gordonston.  Like the new Star Wars series, it reduced the massive size of the world down to almost nothing.  It seemed inevitable that all of these things happened.  It was enjoyable, and although someone else compared it to Desperate Housewives, this one I could actually finish.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This season shows political and legal drama combined with family drama and highlights Alicia finding her way to stand on her own. Prepare to cheer her on.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This movie has so many funny to the bone classic moments in which my family  still laughs our sides off about. John Caddy is hysterical. A must for families who have younger children who parents who are now in their 30-40's when the movie came out.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Yes!  What a book with all sorts of intrigue, plenty of good old rumpy pumpy and a knotted stomach as you get to the end of this book.,  The author must have inside knowledge of the deceit and double cross world of the underbelly of what goes on in the backrooms of MI5 and 6.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Not for children, but one hell of a 5 hour movie worth watching. woooo hoooo!!!!! Oh so graphic but the cast is legendary.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe the poor quality of the story line from a series that I considered a must buy. I'm disappointed in the author. Eva and Gideon's story took a major nose dive into BORING. I never return books but this one I will. Sad that the author decided to drag out this story for money. I'm also so tired of hearing the self promotion on Facebook. I'm unliking her page also.
B001NERPHS|5.0|Some music seeped into your brain when you were - well, younger.  I didn't know until I received this, just how pivotal this music was to my future tastes, expectations and commitments to American music that matters.  There are now some of the original tracks being released on Dylan's own releases.  One day, the Band's cuts will be hauled up from the basement.  But this release still stands the test of time.  An old friend who re-enters your life as if he never went away.
B001NBEWN6|4.0|All relationships involve balancing needs, context, and personal characteristics.  Relationships get even more complicated by societal pressures and taboos. Set in India, this well written tale of love and relationships provides insights on the human condition, a place (India), and a family.  The flash back scenes slowly reveal the secrets that undergird the narrative.  A hard-to-put-down tale.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you're thinking about buying this game don't even think twice. Persona 4 Golden is probably the best title for the PS Vita, this game is the reason I decided not to sell my PS VITA. I'm not going to spoil anything but I've only got 12 hours of gameplay and I'm hooked already, great graphics, great story line, awesome gameplay.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This tale of separation and reunion traces the lives of characters surrounding an extremely poor father's decision to sell a young child.  The characters are entirely believable, and Hosseini's is as usual clear, sympathetic, and gripping.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's brand new kitchen and she loves the set! It's durable, good quality, and she enjoys cooking and serving me meals with this set.  It does have a slight odd odor, but nothing too distracting.  Would definitely recommend.
B002361MLA|4.0|I have started reading this book and I find it very interesting.  If you seem to dwell on your early life and don't<br />enjoy your life as it is now you need to get this book.  It's really a powerful eye opening book.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|I don't care to talk about it. Why not make the ratings something more user friendly? Like, say, give me the option to leave notes but don't force me.<br /><br />Last time I'll rate anything for Amazon, it's too much effort when I want to just leave stars.
B000PC0S5K|4.0|I have not read this book at this time.  I bought it because a friend recommended it to me.  She also<br />recommended the book The Power of  Now.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Here's what I wrote for my Season 1 review.  Apply it to this season as well.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant.  The story?  Well, it has intrigue, greed, lust, sex--all the elements of great storytelling.  The characters?  The Borgias were absolutely &#34;out there.&#34;  Not much else to say.  The thing that impresses me most is that this is based, albeit Hollywood-style--on real people and events, unlike that other blockbuster on the other channel.  I like both, but seeing actual historical characters and events tips the scale for me.  Jeremy Irons has never been better, and that's saying a lot since I've seen nearly everything he's acted in.  Watch the whole series, if only for him.  If you want to check for accuracy, get out a history book.  Here's the thing:  History is written by the winners, so can we ever know for sure?  What we can know is that this is a wonderful series with characters you'll love.  And hate.<br />Warning:  There's some full frontal nudity and lots of violence.  Well, I don't think even the most sanitized history books ever portrayed them as saints.  And some Catholics may be offended at this raw look at one of their popes.  I'm Catholic, and I've always known that popes have human frailties; some, like this one, had a lot of human frailties.  Sorry, but it's true.<br />Bonus:  The actor playing Cesare is not only a fine actor but gorgeous as well.<br /><br />This review goes for all the seasons.  I'm simply going to cut and paste.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story continues with suspense, romance, heat and mystery. You won't be able  to put this  book down. Read it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The book was very good but something about it just doesn't give the same feeling as the first few books.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The game was a bit difficult but was really fun once you got the hang of it.  Loved the graphics and would have liked the game to be longer with more puzzles.
0061950726|5.0|This book is amazing in telling the story of  the orphan trains that were used last century. Young children and babies shipped off across the country in the hopes someone would  adopt them. This story tells of a modern day orphaned teenager helping a elderly lady who was one of thousands of children who were on the orphan train.  Finding a home and friendship is told in a lovely way that you can belong.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I like the story of Gideon and Eva and the book is written well but I was expecting some form of closure given that the author promised it would be a trilogy.  I would have accepted it if she introduced new story lines with the other characters and expanded on them in other books - but the Gideon/Eva storyline should have been concluded as promised.  Given how much this book cost, compared to a lot of good books that are cheaper, the least the author could do was deliver on a promise that this was a trilogy.
1476715904|5.0|Oh my goodness this book. So last year I asked Autumn what books she recommended for me to get on my kindle. (New kindle owner at the time) She said I have to buy Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover. So I did. And on my kindle they sat for a year. Seriously what is wrong with me? I should have started it right away.<br /><br />Slammed was pretty amazing.  I think I worried the poetry stuff would bother me, that it would take away from the story. I don't know where I get these ideas in my head. I like poetry so who knows. But anyway, it didn't in case you are wondering. It was a really nice touch and very much a part of the story.<br /><br />Will Cooper. Can I just say he's going to officially be my book boyfriend for a while now? He's amazing. I love him so hard.. that doesn't sound right, but you get what I'm saying. Lol. I don't want to spoil, but a ton of people have already read this before me. So let's just say, the big secret? I was scared, after having read Hopeless, I was thinking horrid things. No not at all. I have fantasies about this kind of thing. If you have ever had that kind of crush growing up... you know what I'm talking about. *fans self* I did, there was this particular one.<br /><br />I'm not spoiling though, so you want to hear about that, you'll have to ask. Lol<br />Layken, I adored her. I really wanted to smack her a few times though. She learns though and grows up a lot. There are some life changing events that take place, and my heart bled for her. It was not a good idea to read this at the office, but thank goodness for the box of tissues on my desk.<br /><br />Layken's friend Eddie. LOVE her! Much needed comic relief.<br />It's not all sad though, the chemistry between Will and Layken had me smiling and swooning constantly. If you haven't tried reading anything by Colleen Hoover yet, what are you waiting for? I loved this one, and wish I hadn't waited so darn long.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love the show but amazon's streaming quality is in the toilet. If I wanted to watch it on my pc it skipped and jerked and was a terrible experience. I only give five stars for the show, 0 stars for amazon's streaming quality.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I really like this gamepad, the only thing I would change if I had the &#34;power&#34; would be to change the thumb joystick to a D-pad (but that is just my personal preference).  There is a little learning curve as with any controller.  I have been using this for a couple of months with no problems.
B00821OX98|5.0|Plausible plot twists that keep things moving! Did not expect to like. Thought I could never see Noah Wiley in anything other than his ER role. But found this series to be surprisingly well written and acted.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Catherine McPhee is phenomenal and Debra Messing is outstanding! I thought this was gonna be a sorta GLEE copycat, or a musical movie turned tv show type program, but it's as good as the first and nothing like the second. Catherine McPhee steals the show, the way that &#34;has been, can't remember his name&#34; from American Idol stole the crown from Ms. McPhee in her seasons show finale. I hope it's coming back for season 2!!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I did everything from jose altuve of the Houston Astros to Leeloo from The Fifth Element to Slimer to Ralph Wiggum and tom petty even Bradley Nowell of sublime. he got all of them on the first try. this is a very cool app and it actually does what it says. very impressive!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Got interested because of the upcoming film. Not the best book i've read, not the worst either. Can recommend to friends of scifi.
1574214276|5.0|I have several zentangle books.  This one is one of my favorites.  It has great step by step easy to follow instructions with beautiful examples of expanded versions of the same patterns.  It is simple yet inspiring.
0425263924|5.0|First thing I have to say: This is not the end of the series. Everyone is freaking out because the story is going to continue, apparently for 2 more books making this a series, not a trilogy. This book was 356 pages long and I felt that every page, every event, that occurred between Gideon and Eva and the supporting characters was necessary and natural to the plot and their stories. If Ms. Day had ended the series in this book, I would have been extremely annoyed. I would have felt short-changed. In REFLECTED IN YOU, Gideon and Eva's relationship took a major hit. Both of the people have severe trust issues. I'm sorry that everyone is unhappy that their lives can't be wrapped up in a convenient three book package...but come on; this is an amazing story and there is obviously a lot going on here. I'm glad Ms. Day didn't cut the story off just because she'd originally committed to a three book deal. And readers should have expected something like this. An author does not push the release date back as much as Ms. Day did without a very good reason. I wouldn't be surprised if she did some serious re-writes during that time. However, it's still the same characters who are growing into a committed relationship and working through their problems together. I commend Ms. Day for her portrayal of Gideon and Eva's relationships with each other and other people. They are the most real people in the romances I've read. I still believe they will get the HEA they deserve, but they have too many loose ends in their lives right now for that to happen. Cary, Eva's mom, Gideon's WHOLE family...I mean, who really thought that could all be resolved in one book? I give this book five stars because it was totally worth the wait. And I can't wait to see more of Gideon and Eva.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like these types of games from G5, so I definitely liked this one. I just wish it was cheaper, but overall good game.
B009NY43NY|2.0|WARNING: SPOILER REVIEW! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! I'm an avid fan of these books and the show. Granted, they started off in a similar fashion but they are their own entities. Given the world Sookie lives in, I honestly couldn't see an ending that would make me happy. Harris couldn't make the vampires disappear and I think fans would have rioted if she killed Sookie or Sookie \\"woke up from a horrible nightmare to a perfectly happy life\\" an in an insane asylum. That being said, I felt this ending was a true cop out. Eric made all the vampires go away? Riiiiight, because declarations like that ALWAYS kept Eric and HIS brood away! I personally was never on the Sam and Sookie band wagon either so this book did little for me. I'll just re-read the others and make up my own ending, pretending that this never happened...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really did like this book, I felt it was a great continuation of Gideon and Eva's story.  I felt the price ($9.99) was too much for the story, but I will look forward to the next installment.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Love story and will make you think about life and your place in it . I plan on a second watch just to catch more of the message .
B00CATSONE|3.0|I had high hopes for this book and an insight into Tesla.  What I got was a huge dissertation on genius, curiosity, and imagination.  The author then tried to proclaim Tesla's imagination.  This would have been fine if he has spent his time writing about Tesla's imagination.  The truth is, however, that the author spent more time discussing the feud between Edison and his backers and Tesla.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Boring....boring....boring!  That pretty much sums it up!  No action at all!  Deleted from my Kindle after 15 minutes of play!
B000RP4LEO|5.0|This was an inspired artistic interpretation - I was particularly blown away by the 2nd movement - Grimaud is always true to the piece yet unique

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Acting and writing is superb.  I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in England before and during World War I.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My grand boys love this game. Ages 4 and 7<br />It challenges Them although the oldest one  is<br />very competitive and hates to loose
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's a good game to play. And it helps you to pass the time. It allow you to play with your friends also.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have always been a fan of Peter Falk and the Columbo series. I loved the set.<br />The price was amazing.
