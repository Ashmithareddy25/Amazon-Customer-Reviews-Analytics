B000AADYRQ|4.0|This feels like a blend of Transatlanticism and Give Up (Postal Service) to me.  While you might think that the combination could possibly HURT an album, it actually does.  <br />Trying to combine the rock of Transatlanticism with the mellow vibe of Give Up just ends up confusing the listener.  Yes, the lyrics are still solid as ever - but the songs seem to want to get moving, but never seem to go anywhere.   <br />There are a few bright spots on the album, where the band doesn't feel bogged down and tired - I Will Follow You into the Dark, Crooked Teeth, and the excellent Soul Meets Body are all great songs.   <br />The album is still decent, but does not grab you and make you WANT to listen to it the way the previous album did.  All in all, I would recommend this to DCFC fans and recommend Transatanticism to music fans that may have not heard the band yet.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|I have been a huge fan of 30stm for a while now, at least the last 4 years. I was really getting excited for the new album because a 3 year hiatus for song-writing is gold. However, I was very disappointed by this album. Side-stepping the fact that this band is fronted by Jared Leto; I am surpised that so many of the older fans are being swayed by such a lackluster album.  <br />The first album was crazy and out there and big fun in a time when music started to decay in the alt-rock scene. It seems that the second time around the temptation of becoming a trend has overtaken them. This album sadly has Jared trying to sing like that loser from the Used which would explain why they are on tour together... What's next? Chevelle?  <br />But anyway the album does have some interesting parts, but they are few and far between. The album on the whole is very... boring. It's light and borderline emo. What is even more shocking is that this was produced by Josh Abraham. Does this mean that he is also getting greedy for more pop spotlights?  <br />The only reason I didnt give this album 1 star is because there are a couple of cool songs on here, but sadly I spent much of the time yawning before I found them. I mean seriously what was with \\"Attack\\"?! <br />This band was progressive, alternative and spacey, interesting and beautiful. This band now... well I think if they keep down this path they might have to change there name to the Used 2. <br /> <br />Highlight tracks for me: Battle of One, The Fantasy, Hunter. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed out on this when it first came out, mainly because it was never shown on TV here in Australia, but also because I had just finished working my way through 7 seasons of Buffy (which I loved) and was starting to watch Angel and not really getting into it. I was aware that Joss Whedon had another show out, but my lacklustre response to Angel (I do hear it gets better as the series progresses) put me off investing more time in another extended series. <br /> <br />I knew next to nothing about Firefly except something about spaceships, but I had copies of the series from my friend lying around at my place for months and months before I saw the trailer for serenity fairly recently. It was intriguing enough for me to check out the series, and I'm so glad I did. All the fun, exciting, humorous aspects I enjoyed in Buffy exist in Firefly (in spades), even if the dynamics of the characters in many ways mirrors Buffy. However, the characters are unique in their own ways and the realisation of their universe is wonderfully done, even if the concept is not necessarily unique in sci-fi.  <br /> <br />After watching about 3/4 of the series, I'm seriously frustrated by the fact that I know there aren't going to be any more episodes produced for television. Sure, the movie will tide me over, but I just doubt that there'll get the same degree of characterisation in a 2 hour movie as there is in a 14-part series. But hey, anything is better than nothing right? <br /> <br />If you like shows that really make you care about the characters at the same time as just giving you a really entertaining hour or so, do check this out. Hopefully you'll get suckered in and start telling all your friends about it like I have. Maybe we might even get a new series! (well, probably not but it would be nice wouldn't it?). <br /> <br />So, yeah, buy it. It's just a pity that Fox will get a cut of the DVD profits when they royally ****** it over.
B000244FDW|4.0|With yet another impending adaptation of the what is probably the most delightful classic in literature, I thought it would be fun to review this made-for-TV \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" from 1980.<br /><br />Jane Austen junkie I that I am, I am embarressed to say I had never seen this old BBC version until just recently. As you can probably tell from the DVD cover and description, this version is not nearly as sumptuous as the recent A&E adaptation, nor as glossy as the old Hollywood version, but it is fun, because the story is fun, and I would say worth buying for people who can't get enough of Austen's tale.<br /><br />As everyone knows \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" follows the romantic adventures of lively Elizabeth Bennet and her four sisters. In a time when being an old maid was a social and economic disaster with few modern day comparisons, Elizabeth Bennet is determined to marry where her heart takes her, but will her own prejudices lead her astray? We've all seen it a thousand times before, but for me it never gets old.<br /><br />The cast here is adequate if nothing too spectacular. Elizabeth Garvie makes a decent Lizzy, but doesn't quite have the sparkle Jennifer Ehle had in the 90's version. The weak point here is really David Rintoul as Darcy; his performance is unintentionally hilarious. When Lizzy says, \\"I cannot forget his warmth\\", we wonder what she's talking about. Certainly we never see anything but a person who appears to be from another planet, one where everyone speaks and stands so stiffly you could use them as furniture (I realize perfect posture is keeping with the period, but he goes a bit too far). The rest of the cast is okay. Sabina Franklyn as Jane at least manages to come off as genuinely kind and gentle, and Natalie Ogle as silly Lydia and Priscilla Morgan as Mrs. Bennet are both incredibly irritating, but then they're supposed to be.<br /><br />One thing I have never seen any version of \\"P&P\\" get right is the physical characteristics of Mr. Wickham. In the novel, he is supposed to be very very good-looking, and indeed that is why he is perhaps believed over Darcy, who is more subtly handsome. Not even A&E did that right, but the 2005 version looks like it will be the first to correct this mistake. In this old series we have a Wickham who seems to be 95% head.<br /><br />But this story has always been about the fun plot and the witty dialogue, and it's all intact here, thanks to the great Fay Weldon, who adapted it. I would say that although this \\"P&P\\" is the weakest, visually, it's still worth buying for Austen fans or those who love period films and shows.<br /><br />But if for some reason you have never seen a \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" please don't start here, get the A&E adaptation.  And of course, read the book first.<br /><br />GRADE: BMr. Wickham.

B000646MNE|5.0|Better late than never I thought after I saw all seasons. I never saw any of the episodes when the series was on HBO. I watched one on TBS one day and decided I just have to buy the entire set as I liked it so much. The series is fabulous and I am sad that it took me so long to finally watch/own it. In my eyes it is the best series ever (I was an Ally McBeal fan before). The actors/actresses are great. The stories range from funny to hilarious and I needed to catch up with sleep as I watched it till very late every night until the last season was done.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|My little Sony still camera set on video, captured a few precious moments of the 2nd show.  It is amazing to watch.  I KNOW the professionaly shot DVD of all the shows will be the best music video I have and will ever own.  I hope they do another one if there are MSQ shows.  We waited 37 years....and have been rewarded!  Thank you Jack, Ginger and Eric.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|This cd is one of the best Megadeth had created. it is the most thashy album they have and it sounds so much better now they remastered it. it is not true Dave Mustaine recorded new vocals he only did for one album MD.45 it would have cost him a lot more money to record new vocals besides if you listen to it very careful the vocals are remixed and remastered as the whole album is they remaster it separately and then they put it all together and mix it but that doesnt mean the vocals are new!!!! dont believe the other reviews just follow your instint and but the cd cuz its worth your money as everything Megadeth does!!!!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|In this adaptation, a former clergyman uproots his family from their bucolic Southern existence and transplants them to the Northern industrial town of Milton. His daughter, Margaret, is a proud Southerner whose scorn for tradesmen initially causes conflict and insult as she acquaints herself and interacts with the hardworking Northerners, both the working class as well as the masters who own the mills. In particular, she finds John Thornton, a mill owner and her father's new pupil, to be the most offensive after witnessing his brutal treatment of an employee.  <br /> <br />Thornton, however, finds himself drawn to Margaret's strong will and decidedly firm opinions. He seeks to overcome her contempt of him through reason and words but her longing for the South makes it impossible for him to verbalize his thoughts in a way that will appease her. When she begins to sympathize with the mill workers, conflict between the two of them creates a schism that seems almost impossible to bridge.  <br /> <br />The television adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South bears no reference to the Civil War that took place in the United States. Rather, the setting of the story takes place in England and the title refers to the contrasting outlooks that were brought about due to the Industrial Revolution. And while Margaret and Thornton are constantly at odds with each other over the plight of the workers, their war is limited to verbal sparring. The conflict between Thornton and the workers, on the other hand, touches upon the developing power of the union workers and does border on the violent though it never escalates into a full-fledged war.  <br /> <br />Because Thornton is truly at the heart of this adaptation, it is reasonable to say that Richard Armitage's portrayal was essential to the success of the miniseries. It is fortunate that he gave such a powerful performance that displayed his character's role as a respected business owner and a man beset by love for a womanwho clearly disdains him.  <br /> <br />Also of note is Daniela Denby-Ashe's performance as Margaret whose Southern sensibilities are the catalyst for change regarding the workers as well as Thornton. Strong support comes from Sinead Cusack, whose portrayal of Thornton's proud and protective mother gives heart to a character who initially seems to have none and Brendan Coyle, who gives a powerful and sometimes painfully humorous performance as Nicholas Higgins, the third character who is key to putting Thornton in touch with his own humanity.  <br /> <br />The BBC did a fantastic job with this adaptation despite the liberties it took with the book. I greatly anticipate its availability in the United States come November.
B000002GWJ|5.0|I'm not the type who gives 5 stars to any above-average album that tickles my fancy. It's just I usually only review albums that are special to me. Hence, I am reviewing this. It's great. He hit something here, it was a sort of pro album if you get me. As great as they were, the albums before this sounded a bit like a new guy trying very hard to get that sound he had in his head on to tape, whereas on Blue Valentine he sounds like a natural. Sounds just like he's been doing this for decades and he just got a few musicians and popped into a studio and nailed a classic Waits album. The same goes for Heartattack And Vine. He was really getting into this style.  <br /> <br />      The vibe is top-class. Late-night metropolitan sleazebags, junkies, hookers, winos. It's all there. You can hear the neon-lit signs in that vibraphone-type of instrument in Red Shoes By The Drugstore. There is great maudlin romance and sentimentality in cuts like Kentucky Avenue and the title track, and, in my opinion, Christmas Card From Minneapolis is quite possibly a contender for the greatest song ever written. So much colour, power, passion, character. Great stuff. And of course, to give it that natural feel there are some great blues numbers that just flow and, although they don't strike you as being amazing, they are just as important as the other tunes. Listen to '28$' or 'Whistlin' Past The Graveyard' a few times, soon you won't be able to imagine the record without them. Oh, I almost forgot, his cover of 'Somewhere' is quite excellent, too.
B00001U0DP|4.0|This movie is just great. The movie is a funny philosophical one that deals with the question of \\"Beautiful life\\". Benigni wanted to make a statement that life is beautiful only as long as people see it is beautiful. He emphasis this by using a dramatic story of a jew who was sent to one of those Nazis WWII camps with his family. Despite the horrible situation, he just make fun of it and provided the most interesting and funny days for his young son. <br /> <br />Then why i am giving him 4-stars... just because of the final seen (The american tank) ... it is not out of the scope of the movie, but i just didn't like it.. <br />
B000002C1W|5.0|Review: Gets better every time I listen to it. At first glance it was ok, but Gilmour knows what he's doing as has known for the many years this band has been at it. Gilmour is the best member in this group. Waters was great, he had his time, but then he went on to take over the band for his own. The Wall is classic, but The Final Cut is my least favorite Floyd album I own out of almost all of them. After Waters left the music came back and rocked like Gilmour and the boys wanted it, like back in the old days, but with a new twist. It's nice and dark and adapts well in the 80s for a classic band such as Pink Floyd. Their lyrics were always good and out there, but their music is what drives me the most with Pink Floyd. Momentary has that.  <br /> <br />Best Moment: Pretty much every song on the album, it is hard to choose a favorite, but I might suggest \\"The Dogs of War\\", the beautiful \\"On the Turning Away\\" and well every song is pretty much equal to me. The vocals are great, unlike the crazy vocals of Waters on The Wall, which are perfect for that type of album, but Pink Floyd was more moving with calmer vocals. <br /> <br />Weakest Moment: HA! None. <br /> <br />Unique/Bizarre Moment: The cover art is awesome! One of the coolest covers I've ever seen. Why is the critic's review so low? Don't even bother to judge it by the stars and judge it by your ears. <br /> <br />
B00001QEG5|4.0|O.K before I begin this review, let me just say that I am a big Twisted Sister fan..makes sense since I bought this album and will take the time to review it.....so a little biased towards TS I might be...and since I have received no formal training as a music critic and could really care less about the technical aspects of the music or how proficient the bass player is in playing his instrument( I'll leave that for the true MUSIC GEEKS out there) I do care about one thing....DOES IT ROCK???...does it make me wanna stay in my car to hear the next song????...does it take me back to a time when acid wash jeans were the style and DEE SNIDER was the baddest frontman in rock????   A BIG YES TO ALL OF THE ABOVE!!!!!.....if you want music to save the world, listen to U2...if you want bad poetry put to a boring beat, listen to Coldplay...if you wanna hear some white guy pretend to be black and pick on his mom on every fckin song,listen to Eminem....but if you wanna be honest with yourself and admit that almost all of todays music sucks you will come to the same conclusion that I came to as well.....the best record i bought in 2005 was made in 1987.....LOVE IS FOR SUCKERS....now go save the world Bono!!!!
B000002U9W|5.0|Review: Pink Floyd didn't care to much for it. It is quite weird and different. I like it though. Atom Heart Mother has no songs featured on their big greatest hits set, because critics thought it was too odd of an album for such a mainstream world. This album is a great delight of music genious. I recommend it if you want to hear some strange yet beautiful work from Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Best Moment: \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" the song! <br /> <br />Weak Moment: Guy eating food in \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\". <br /> <br />Unique/Bizarre Moment: The Cow! Also, \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" I'm still not in love with the song, it has it's moments with Richard Wright though. The eating noises are weird.
B00006EXL5|5.0|'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love' is an amazing CD. The songs are very dark, most definitely darker than those found on the 'Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge' album, but they have an amazing, high-speed energy to them. Almost every song on this album has great rhythm, killer guitar solos, unstoppable drum beats, and crashing vocals. There is something about this album that just leaves you in a happy mood. Although the album is darker than the mainstream album 'Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge', it will definitely leave you awestruck.

B00064ADR0|4.0|This was not the only three-sided album released by anyone, ever, as the previous reviewer wrote. Here's another: Rahsaan Roland Kirk released \\"The Case of the Three Sided Dream in Audio Color\\" and it was three sides of music on vinyl with a blank fourth side . . . until the very end, when he suddenly appears and laughs at the listener for getting this far on a blank record. Not his best, but hilarious. As for the Winters, they lived in my town of Port Washington when I was growing up and we revered and feared and loved them. our rockers. they showed up in front of the music store on main street during a street festival once upon a time, when david pitt and barbara merjan's band was playing. They took over the instruments and launched into, I believe, johnny be goode. We had a mini riot and stomped a car to death. Ahh, to be 13 again.

B000002JPA|5.0|i don't like to write about older cd's. i think that they are a part of our past time and, of course, a part of an epoca that will no return. <br />for example, 'ROCK & ROLL OVER' of KISS was my first long play when i was 8... but when i listen to it now, i don't listen to music, i listen to memories related to that years. <br /> <br />i've been reading a lot of reviews that speaks of albums that were GREAT when they were released, but the reviewers thinks that they are crap because they doesn't likes now in 2005... that's a great error. if it were the criterion, then black sabbath is not heavy, pink floyd sounds bad, the rolling stones are repetitive and clumsy, and a lot more... <br /> <br />well, but i'm not writing about others or anothers. i'm writing about what is, to my understand, the best album of DT... until today, with the recent release of their last album OCTAVARIUM. <br />what makes it so good? a lot of things, of 1992 related years, and still, 2005 year. <br /> <br />first, i've found this CD to its release in 1992, and i was impressed in every way. EVERY. the music, the lyrics, the musicians, the production... everythings was PERFECT. at that years i was listening to a lot of things that includes POSION and PANTERA... and it was different!. nothing of which i used to listen was similar to it! in that years everyone was worried about how they look or how they earn, but not if their music was good... some albums of that year are 'dirt', 'adrenalize', 'dehumanizer', 'back to the light', 'dog eat dog', 'march or die', 'fear of the dark'... of course, i like a lot of that albums, but no one is like IMAGES AND WORDS. you can listen to it now and its so powerfull, so hipnotic, son wonderful... it's hard to my spanish find the correct word in english... but i hope that all of you understand the meaning of this. <br /> <br />the best track are 'metropolis'... its SO GOOD, that they made a complete disc with the second part!. 'learning to live' is another incredible song... and both are near 10 min!. and the other six songs are excellent too. 'another day', 'surrounded' and 'wait for sleep' are the slow ones (and the last one only played in piano and vocals), and 'pull me under', 'take the time' and 'under a glass moon' are the power ones... without forgetting the first two. <br /> <br />taking this album to THIS YEAR, 2005, still is an EXCELLENT album and doesn't need any changes. the sound, the production, the musicians, all of the album is so great... so great... so dream theater.   <br /> <br />summarizing. the best cd that i've been listening to in years.
0671015206|5.0|Not only does this book explain many hunches I've had for decades (like who's full of baloney versus not) but it is also a great tool for recruiting sales people. After reading this I\\"ve discovered that the most likely successful sales people (for my company) are a) those that come from low income, distressed, or limited financial means rather than b) children of spoiled high income/high consumption families.  <br /> <br />I just fired someone that fell into the latter category when this book reaffirmeed she was never going to be successful. <br />
B00003L2I0|5.0|I've been a Gilbert O'Sullivan fan since I heard for the first time the haunting melody of \\"Alone, Naturally\\" back in 1971. He had a succession of hits after that but he seemed to fade after a few hits. Some of the songs here never made it on radio airplay (that I know about) here in the US. For example, \\"You are you\\" is such a catchy tune. The lyrics are dated but hey, the music is excellent. \\"What's in a Kiss\\" is another one. Great song - similar to \\"You are you\\" but never made it on airplay in the US. O'Sullivan presents a knack for writing songs with a universal appeal but retains his Irish charm in his singing style.  <br /> <br />Since I was spoiled with the great music of the 70's (greatest decade for music),  O'Sullivan is one of the few that stands out for me. Buy this CD and enjoy it for what it is. A fresh and unique singer songwriter that is guaranteed to please even the most discriminating ear!

B000AADYRQ|5.0|I think the fact that Death Cab went mainstream pretty much downgraded them in my mind. I'm not really a fan of what everyone else is a fan of, usually. As great at Transatlanticism was, it lost its appeal as it gained some with the rest. But this album returned Death Cab to what they truly were and are: a great musical talent. <br /> <br />However, I got this album on faith that the other Death Cab albums I own would come through in their own way.  This album is truly amazing and one of my favorite Death Cab releases ever.  I do own all the rest and I put them on a pedestal compared to most of the rest of my collection, but this one is quite as good if not better than all of them. <br /> <br />It's worth whatever you want to pay for it. Just have it.
B000002I4W|5.0|In 1959, jazz was having its foundation shaken.  An upstart musician, composer and theorist who recorded a couple uneven LPs in Los Angeles had moved to New York and shook the ideas upon which jazz was built-- ideas like chord changes being the framework for improvisation, ideas about how rhythm should sound, ideas about when playing in key is not good.  Blowing on a white plastic alto saxophone, Ornette Coleman polarized the jazz world-- musicians, critics, fans, in a manner reminiscent to Charlie Parker's arrival on the scene.  To this day, he continues to do so, particularly in the face of discussions of what is \\"pure\\" jazz, and yet the influence of Ornette Coleman is felt far and wide in the music-- certainly many contemporary jazz legends picked up pointers from him, even if they were inclined to deny it-- recordings by Sonny Rollins (\\"Our Man in Jazz\\"), John Coltrane (just about anything), Charles Mingus (\\"Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus\\"), and Miles Davis (\\"ESP\\", \\"On the Corner\\") in the time after Coleman's arrival all bore his unmistakable influence, and artists as diverse as Pat Metheny, Jason Moran, Branford Marsalis and John Zorn all claim him as an influence or have paid homage to him.  And in many ways, it all started with this album, titled \\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\".  Truer words were rarely spoken. <br /> <br />Coleman's music, codefied abstractly as \\"harmolodics\\"-- a system that gets more and more difficult to understand every time Coleman discusses it-- is based on one large essential difference to most music at the time-- conceptually, the soloist determines the direction of the piece.  The form relies on head-improv-head structures so common in bebop, but there are no chord changes-- if the soloist decides he wants to change keys, change tempos, wail off key, whatever, he does it.  There are some rules to it, clearly, or it would sound like a disorganized mess, but rather than the structure being in place, that is improvised as well.  Inmany ways, I've often suspected this is the reason pianos are so rarely heard in Coleman's music-- they are a chord-oriented instrument, and without changes, they'd have a much more difficult time (Coleman must have found a way to get it through to pianists though as his most recent recordings feature piano).  The music is often described as difficult, but this is a bit naive-- the music is different, and certainly anyone unfamiliar with jazz will find it difficult, but the reality is, it's highly accessible, it swings, it's firmly rooted in the blues, and it even has traces of the \\"Spanish Tinge\\".  What makes it seem \\"difficult\\" is the lack of piano (a touchstone of jazz) and the more open structure.  But even casual listening will reveal memorable themes and great playing, certainly enough for good music.  Critics dismiss his theories as having been developed simply to get around his own lack of understanding of transposition-- this may be the case, but it doesn't matter.  His music is what it is, and sometimes innovation comes about because of misunderstanding. <br /> <br />On \\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\", Coleman assembled a group of musicians sympathetic to his playing who would be associated with him for the remainder of their careers-- trumpeter Don Cherry, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins.  The band runs through six pieces composed by the leader, and in many ways this is the album Coleman's reputation is built on.  All six pieces are superb-- be they mournful ballads (the superb \\"Lonely Woman\\", featuring an alto 'cry' from Coleman during the theme that could not happen playing conventionally in key), gentle, keening ballads (\\"Peace\\") or explosive pyrotechnics (\\"Focus on Sanity\\").  Throughout the playing is top notch, with Coleman soloing superbly on many pieces-- digging in and putting forth a human expression on his sax rarely heard in music (his fluid and ecstatic solo on \\"Eventually\\", passion and grace on \\"Peace\\").  For his part, Cherry offers counterpoint to his leader nicely-- his technical limitations are more than compensated for by inventiveness, lack of cliche, and cleverness in his soloing (\\"Chronology\\"), as well as the ability to pour his heart into his horn and match Coleman's grace, dignity and beauty (\\"Peace\\").  Haden and Higgins provide a sympathetic rhythm section who move with the horns and provide a tight swing-- check their playing on \\"Focus on Sanity\\" after Haden's brief, abstracted solo and underneath Coleman or on \\"Congeniality\\" and \\"Chronology\\", clearly the two of them are rooted deep in swing traditions but still find their way to sustain Coleman's viewpoint. <br /> <br />In reality, \\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\" is one of those classic and essential albums of the genre.  It should be in everyone's collection, even if you don't think it'll be your thing, it's worth checking out.  Highly recommended.
0345363132|5.0|I am probably one of the few people who has read this book and knew nothing about Richard III.  I guess this is a good thing because I was able to read and enjoy this book without any preconceived notions on Richard's guilt or inocence.<br /><br />With that being said, I have to say that this is the BEST historical fiction that I have read thus far.  I learned that much time, research and effort went into the making of this first novel by SKP and it really shows.  For me, never has a historical story been so informative yet so entertaining.  As one reviewer wrote, you do not have to love historical fiction in order to enjoy this book.<br /><br />SKP did a great job in her description of those times that even when I was reading about the many battles fought I was never bored (that is a plus, considering I hate anything to do with war).  She made all her characters, even minor ones, come to life by giving them a voice.  While reading this story you either come away hating or loving a character. By the end of this book I could not contain my sadness at how it all ends.  I can't remember any other book that has made me cry or feel depressed because of the ending.  The love story between Anne Neville and Richard York was not only awe inspiring but heartbreaking.  It is this and all betrayal, envy, loyalty, deceit, honesty and all other range of human emotions that make this book unforgettable.<br /><br />What is truly remarkable about this book is that it helped me realize that the wars that we fight today are the same wars fought so long ago.  We would like to delude ourselves into thinking that we are fighting for freedom and peace but the grim reality is that we are mainly fighting for power and because of greed.  It seems that we are doomed to repeat past mistakes.<br /><br />Thanks SKP for bringing this wonderful story to life - it is one that I will not soon forget.  Mitzi
B000002I55|5.0|By 1960, Ornette Coleman had already stirred an enormous controversy in the jazz world-- his first three albums on Atlantic (two early recordings on Contemporary failed to garner much attention) and tenure at Manhattan's Five Spot club had polarized musicians, critics, and listeners.  And yet, over forty years later, it's clear that Coleman was onto something, and his influence can be felt throughout music afterwards, whether acknowledged by the musician or not, whether accepted and adopted or rejected.  After 1960, Coleman rejected most of the expectations for a musician-- playing clubs, touring, album after album, mellowing with age, regurgitation of old songs, etc.  Indeed, throughout the years he has continued to stir the pot, if a bit more gently than he did when he first reached New York.  But nothing he has done has created such an enormous polarizing effect as this record, \\"Free Jazz\\". <br /> <br />Conceptually, the idea is a retread on the collective improvisations of the swing era-- the piece features several motifs, separated by lengthy improvisations, during which other members of the band were encouraged to offer counterpoint, melodic invention, echo, whatever.  To increase the possibility of interaction, his then working quartet (Coleman on alto, Don Cherry on trumpet, Charlie Haden on bass and Ed Blackwell on drums) were augmented by a second quartet of Eric Dolphy (performing on bass clarinet), Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Scott LaFaro (soon to replace Haden in Coleman's working band) on bass, and Coleman's former drummer Billy Higgins. <br /> <br />So now you know the concept, the question is how does it work?  It depends, largely on your point of view.  Certainly the music is engaging, intriguing, and fills your ears with quite a bit to listen to.  The responsiveness of the playing works better at some times than it does during others-- Dolphy and Cherry both seem to do the best responding to other soloists and inspire the best responses to their soloing.  Certainly everyone's playing is filled with an ecstatic spirit that maintains the excitement of the piece.  And I personally find the recording far superior to all works of collective \\"free\\" improvisation that it inspired (Coltrane's \\"Ascension\\", Ayler's \\"New York Ear & Eye Control\\", etc.). <br /> <br />There's also a bunch of points made by other reviewers that should be reiterated.  This isn't chaos, the music is organzied, but again just not in the way anything previous to it was.  Also, and perhaps more importantly, this is not for everyone.  It's not \\"difficult\\" per se, anymore than any of the other free jazz stuff is (although it is moreso than most of Coleman's other works), but it IS a 40 minute sustained performance, and certainly that alone is unusual to hear.  It's also in an idiom outside of conventional listening-- if you're not familiar with Coleman, pick up \\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\" and see what you make of that before this one, it's more likely to inspire a positive reaction, and if you're not familiar with jazz, this is probably not the place to start (I know folks who did pick this up first).  Finally and most importantly, don't think too much about what this is supposed to be and what it's not supposed to be, enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br />Personally, I find it one of the most consistently interesting and rewarding records Coleman did during his tenure with Atlantic, and the concepts on here informed his music for years to come (Prime Time in particular is very much an electric version of this record).  This CD adds the bonus of the rehearsal for the piece-- it's significantly briefer (under twenty minutes), but no less interesting.  For the adventerous and the fan of avant-garde jazz, this is an essential recording.  Highly recommended.
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is a total mind trip from start to finish. All the performances are top-notch especially the one from Guy Pearce. The best thing about this DVD is the chronological version of the movie on disc 2. For those who haven't seen it yet, I recommend you watch the original movie on disc 1 then watch the chronological version.
0790731509|5.0|This 1967 movie holds up well after all these years. Although George Kennedy won a much deserved Oscar for his role as Dragline, Paul Newman should have gotten one as well for he is as good in this film as any he has made. The critics I believe have underestimated his acting ability, probably in part because of his good looks. No one with eyes that blue can act too. Newman is cast here as the noncomformist Lucas Jackson who gets sent to prison for destroying parking meters while on a drinking rampage. Newman's egg-swallowing scene has become a classic, and the phrase \\"what we're got here here is a failure to communicate\\" has become part of our language. Newman really does a fine acting job here, even when he sings \\"I don't care if it rains or freezes/As long as I've got my plastic Jesus,\\" having just learned of the death of his mother.<br /><br />My one complaint about the film is no fault of Newman's. The religious overtones get a little heavy-handed. For example, there is one frame where Luke is lying wearing only his shorts with his arms stretched out and one foot over the other in a classic crucifixion pose. Then there is the scene where he runs into a deserted church complete with a wooden cross on top of it and laments his fate in a loud voice.<br /><br />This film is still very entertaining and much worth your viewing time.

B0002S947K|4.0|I discovered Ray LaMontagne while watching an episode of Later With Jools Holland. I was reading and had no intension of paying any attention to him at all. And then I heard his voice. What a voice, its so soulful, so attention grabbing. I loved his performance and within a few days got his cd. I highly recommend it. Its the perfect cd to have playing in the background while reading, studying, sitting around doing nothing, or whatever you might be doing. Though if you are reading or studying you might be distracted by his wonderful songwriting abilities and get nothing accomplished. I hope that he he's here to stay for a long time
B000069CWE|5.0|I admit it: I used to hate this album with a passion.  I thought that nothing could<br />compare to the original Hybrid Theory album.  I was wrong, for Reanimation is<br />superior in every way to HT.  I'll going to take you through each individual song,<br />with the guest artists (some from the rap world, some from the rock world):<br />1. Opening: Actually, a very good track with violin music leading into...<br />2. Pts. Of Athrty: Remix of Points of Authority, featuring Jay Gordon, of Orgy.  An<br />average track<br />3. Enth E Nd: Remix of In the End, feat. Motion Man and Kutmasta Kurt.  I think it's<br />nothing like the original... that said, it's probably better than the original.  It<br />has much more original lyrics; the only thing I don't get is why Motion Man threw in<br />the Nerf reference...<br />4. Chali: A phone message between Mike and Chali 2na, leading into...<br />5. Frgt/10: Remix of Forgotten, featuring Alchemist and Chali 2na.  One of my<br />favorite tracks, especially because of Chali 2na's rap part at the very end.<br />6. P5hng Me A*wy: Remix of Pushing Me Away, featuring Stephen Richards, of Taproot.<br />This, my friends, is the best track on the album.  I don't know exactly why I like<br />it so much; I just do.<br />7. Plc.4 Mie Haed: Remix of A Place for My Head, featuring Amp Live and Zion of Zion<br />I.  Not a bad remix, just average.<br />8. X-ecutioner Style: Original song, featuring the X-ecutioners and Black Thought,<br />of rap group The Roots.  The only truly original song on here, and a good song.<br />9. H! Vltg3: One of two Hybrid Theory EP remixes, this one of High Voltage.  The<br />song features Evidence, DJ Babu, and Pharaohe Monch.  It's my second-favorite song<br />on the album.<br />10. Riff Raff: Filler track to intro...<br />11. Wth>You: Remix of With You, featuring Aceyalone with a special mix by Linkin<br />Park's Chairman Hahn.  A pretty good song, especially Aceyalone's rap part.<br />12. Ntr/mssion: Another sketch, intro-ing...<br />13. Ppr:kut: Remix of Papercut, featuring DJ Cheapshot, Jubacca, Rasco, and Planet<br />Asia. My tie with H! Vltg3 for second-best song.<br />14. Rnw@y: Remix of Runaway, featuring Backyard Bangers and Phoenix Orion.  Another<br />quite average track.<br />15. My{Dsmbr: The second of two Hybrid Theory EP remixes, this one of My December.<br />This one is just Chester singing, and is a VERY good song.<br />16. Stef:  Yet another filler sketch; intros...<br />17. By_Myslf: Remix of By Myself, featuring Josh Abraham and Stephen Carpenter.<br />Wow... another average track.<br />18. Kyur4 Th Ich: Remix by Chairman Hahn of his own track, Cure for the Itch....<br />DISCLAMER: THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GREAT<br />19. 1stp Klosr:  Remix of One Step Closer; features The Humble Brothers and Jonathan Davis (lead singer of Korn).  One of the most amazing LP tracks in existence, especially Davis' part.<br />20. Krwling: Remix of Crawling, featuring Aaron Lewis (of Staind).  The intro is taken directly from track 1, and it just rocks!!!<br /><br />I just woke up, so there's no way I can end this interestingly.  So here's what I'll say: if you're even remotely a fan of Linkin Park, techno, or damn good music in general, you can't afford to miss out on Reanimation.Asia. My tie with H!

0345475674|4.0|Robert Harris' Pompeii delivers even before Vesuvius lets loose.  The story of the Aquarius Attilius has a double does of forboding, one of which the character is aware (that something suspicious is going on with a missing Aquarius and questions about the water supply, a nice Chinatown the movie touch lending a degree of noir charm to the book) and one of which the reader is very clearing aware and the author makes clear at the beginning of each chapter (the imminent explosion of the volcano).  When said event does happen, all hell breaks loose and all stray bits of plot come together very nicely.  Pliny makes an inevitable, yet very effective, appearance.  If there ever is to be a noir-historical-disaster novel genre, let this book set its standard.
B00005JN5X|3.0|If you thought the film \\"Brothers Grimm\\" looked like a cross between Army of Darkness and Sleepy Hollow (as I did), you'll be sadly mistaken.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend the film as one falling into the same league as AOD.  It belongs with Van Helsing as a sort of stilted horror-action film, though I thought Van Helsing was better. <br /> <br />So what went wrong?  Well, the story's premise has tons of potential, and is a fantastic idea.  The bringing of different fairy tales in as cameos around a spooky Music Man kind of movie is brilliant.   <br /> <br />But the script seemed a little dull.  This is the kind of film where every line has to sparkle, in the same way that The Mummy (Fraser) and Pirates of the Caribbean sparkled.  But it doesn't have enough comic relief to counter balance the darkness of the subject.  Add to that Gilliam's grim directing style, and the film gets totally bogged down.   <br /> <br />Then there's the directing.  Gilliam makes decisions to not punch up perfectly good punch lines, and also makes the decision to have Jacob be more of a side-kick than a foil for his brother.  These two choices, IMHO, are enough to further weigh down the movie's tone into the realm of just plain bad. <br /> <br />Overall, the movie is worth seeing, but only barely.  I enjoyed it, but I didn't like it.  It is absolutely worth Netflixing, quite worth renting, tolerably worth a matinee or 2nd run theater showing, but absolutely not worth full admission.

B00025ETIW|4.0|Before the release of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, My Chemical Romance was just another struggling band who probably wouldn't go anywhere--that all changed as soon as this album starting hitting the mainstream and recieved lots of airplay on MTV. Fans of hardcore emo/punk may like this, but it is doubtful. If you're more of a mainstream/modern punk fan, at least listen the audio samples. <br /> <br />The mood of the whole album is generally depressing, angsty, and as one would call it.. \\"emo\\". Some of the lyrics include talk of slitting wrists, suicide, and such. Although this is a very bland formula, My Chemical Romance seems to make it work. Generally, I won't like bands such as Taking Back Sunday or The Used, but My Chemical Romance seems to have something different - maybe it's Gerard Way's haunting voice - that makes them above average in the whole 'mainstream emo' field. <br /> <br />Were there flaws in this album? Of course there were, no album is perfect. (Hence why I never give an album a 5-star rating.) Some of the lyrics are clichd and not very creative -- for example, Give 'Em Hell, Kid: \\"If you were here / I'd never have a fear / So go on, live your life / But I miss you more than words can ever say\\", and just that sort of thing. <br /> <br />So, here's my individual track rating. <br /> <br />1. Helena: 9/10. A great song. In fact, an awesome song. In fact, one of the greatest songs on the album. With a creative melody, energetic tempo, and a just plain fun and rebellious mood. The only thing I don't like about the song is how overplayed it is. Yes, MTV seems to kill every quality song by airing the video about 1,000 times before it's \\"retired.\\" <br /> <br />2. Give 'Em Hell, Kid: 9/10. Although not my absolute favorite, it is one of my more favored tracks. The quick piano introduction leads up to the haunting, thrill-ride tone of Gerard's voice as he chants: \\"Took a train out of New Orleans / and they shot me full of ephedrine / This is how we like to do it in the murder scene / Can we settle up the score?\\" The haunting, absolutely amazing verse blends into the... less than favorable chorus, with the clichd lyric and modern feel. The first and second verses are what make this song so good. <br /> <br />3. To The End: 8/10. A high quality song, although there's nothing too memorable. Very similar to Give 'Em Hell, Kid. I absolutely love the lyrics on this one though. <br /> <br />4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison: 10/10. All right! Here comes what many consider to be one of the strongest tracks on the whole album. The whole song is rebellious, juvenile, and... for lack of a better word, undefined. One would think from the chorus alone that this has to do with homosexuality, but it seems like a lot more to me. The hook is brilliant, the chorus is brilliant... the track is brilliant. I love it. <br /> <br />5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise): 3/10. Poppy, overplayed, uninspirational, has almost a \\"juvenile\\" feel to it. The only real weak spot on the album. If you're going to buy this album because you heard this song, don't waste your time. Compared to the brilliance of the rest of this album, I was almost tempted to delete this one from my library. <br /> <br />6. The Ghost of You: 10/10. Another one of my favorites. I know I've used this word a lot, but I'll say this: It's the most 'haunting' (sorry!) track on the album. Try listening to this during a pitch-black midnight. It's awesome, so creepy, so amazing... Yet so philosophical. I love it. <br /> <br />7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You: 10/10. I think this one might just be my favorite. As \\"The Ghost of You\\" fades out, you start to hear the piano for this one. I love the chorus, the hook, the witty lyrics... I love it all. I wish this would be a single, but it's doubtful. <br /> <br />8. Interlude: 6/10. All right, it's not much of a song, just a small... well... interlude? But it keeps with the mood of the previous two tracks. Although, once it ends... be prepared to get up and dance. I'm serious. <br /> <br />9. Thank You For The Venom: 10/10. The last 'memorable', 'amazing' track on this album. So effing awesome. The guitar solo, the energy, the lyrics... Nothing you can't love about this one. <br /> <br />10. Hang 'Em High: 7/10. Love the Western-style intro, and... that's about all there is to love. Everything else is just average, although not bad. <br /> <br />11. It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A Death Wish: 3/10. Ugh. I can't stand this. It's full of screaming and the blatant \\"I HATE YOU!\\" screaming that you would expect from a garage emo band. <br /> <br />12. Cemetery Drive: 9/10. I'd LOVE to see this one as a single, I think it would do well. Yes, it's about suicide and has a graveyard-like theme to it, but it's amazing (although not as amazing on The Ghost of You or Thank You For The Venom). The only really \\"sad\\" song on the album. (Everything else is either juvenile, raging, or just philosophical.) <br /> <br />13. I Never Told You What I Do For A Living: 2/10. Worse than track #11, it's not memorable (in fact it's quite easy to forget it exists), and the only real 'filler'. <br /> <br />All in all, a nice strong album. Yes, it has its weak points, but no album is perfect.
B000AADYYO|5.0|IMO, This has replaced \\"Blackwater Park\\" as Opeth's best effort. Not only is the song-writing spot on, but the production is superb. The addition of the full-time keyboardist, a move which has marked a permanent downturn for many hard rock bands in the past, seems to be truly inspired and the end result is welcome. I'm certainly looking forward to the tour in support of this record...and to everyone who got a hold of the leaked version -- you had BETTER support the band and buy a copy!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|The new album takes on new direction, but continues to rock and stray from the same force fed main-stream rock. It's full of frEsh traCks witH familiar undErtones. These guys stilL rOck aNd provide an album full of something completely different. Songs that get you moving and songs to bare your soul. 5 Stars, another great album. <br /> <br />Attack, The Fantasy, Battle of one, and The story rank at the top of my list. Catch them live, and become a fan for life. The energy of this band on stage and off continues to fuel the desire for more.
B000084T18|2.0|Hey guys. Howard Tuttleman here. I don't know a whole lot about this hip-hop/rap thing, but I here this guy I know named Joe saying words from it a lot. They are always some kind of threat or put-down. I'm not always sure what to say about this rapping-music, but I guess I can appreciate it because basically ANYBODY could play it, no matter how bad of a singer you are. Heck, 50-Cent was a criminal and even HE made a record. The idea I get of rap is that you think about how you feel and just sort of talk-it-out and try to make it rhyme. At first I really liked this concept because you could pretty-much SAY whatever you want, and if you can't sing-out those high notes, or if your voice cracks a lot, you have nothing to worry about. You just talk-it-out. Most people I know are pretty-good at talking. So I thought \\"Wow! This is music for the common-man.\\" But then I started to hear what they were REALLY using this medium for. Talking about yourself to try to level yourself up, and dishing out threats of violence or death to the other rappers who are trying to level-up. A viscious-circle.  <br /> <br />Now that would be just fine if they were just talking-around for a joke, but these guys actually shoot at each-other sometimes, and a few have even died about it. This in-turn makes them more famous, but doesn't that seem like a big-price to pay for fame and fortune?  <br /> <br />Now my best solution would be that they should stop trying to yell bad things at each-other, get to know each-other a little better, and maybe sort out their problems over dinner or coffee or something. They should leave the guns at home, too. Then, once they get to know each other they could bring their better attitudes to their songs.  <br /> <br />I mean, they're all in the same business togeter and doing well for themselves. Why not throw out compliments instead of insults? Encouragment instead of threats? This would make the music a lot more accessible to the general-public who can't relate to killing their colleagues. It would also create a sort of web-of-trust between artists.  <br /> <br />I would really like to hear some rapping on the radio along the lines of \\"Hey there, good job on your last single. It had a good beat, keep up the good work, guy,\\" directed at another rapper. It would make the other rapper more comfortable, so he might even make HIS next rap something like \\"Hey, thanks man! I like your style too. We should hang-out more. How's tha family?\\" Or just a general compliment like \\"Hey, Nike's huh? I like Nike too. Where'd you get those ones? Hope you got a good deal, man\\". They could make it all rhyme of course, in their own special ways.  <br /> <br />And as far as rappers telling everyone that they are the best-ever, and how everyone else is terrible, they could show a little modesty once in a while. For example, why not be more like \\"Hey, I'm pretty confident about my music, but their is always room for improvment. I always strive to be the best, but don't get me wrong, these other guys are really good and you should check them out too\\". Or maybe something like \\"Hey, did you hear this other guy's album? It's so good that it inspired me to do better. You guys should really hear it\\". You know how happy that would make the other guy? This could solve a lot of the violence problems between rappers, and could possibly prevent deaths. Just a few simple steps in commom-curtiousy.  <br /> <br />Now I'm not suggesting that ALL of these guy get along or whatever. I mean, some people just don't get along with each-other. However, instead of talking about how you hate them, you could be a little less hostile about it. Maybe something like \\"Hey, to be honest I didn't really dig your new record. But it might not have been your fault. Your band might have been playing the wrong chords or something. You should come over some time and maybe I could give you a few pointers and take you out to dinner\\". If he handled it like that, the other guy could verywell be like \\"Thanks for the offer. I'm not really a big fan of yours, but you seem like a good guy. What's your screen-name? We should talk more\\". Do you see what this could do for the music-industry!?  <br /> <br />Now these are just a few ideas I've had, and you can throw in yours if you'd like. Like I said, I'm pretty new to this genre of music and maybe there is still something I'm not understanding. It's just that I've heard some of these threats and put-downs and thought how crazy that would be if say, the guy from Metallica sang about how much he hated the guy from U2, and started a blood-feud. Or if like, Tom Petty shot the guy from Weezer to death. That just wouldn't make ANY sense to rock-fans, but somehow this has become the norm in Rap-Music.  <br /> <br />I even heard that some of the rockers even DO make songs for each-other. Apparently David Bowie made a song called \\"A Song For Bob Dylan\\". AND IT'S NICE. He doesn't make fun of him or threaten to kill him. Imagine that. Let me know what you guys think. Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
B000062YAZ|5.0|those two \\"kid's reviews\\" and everyone who disses Slayer seriously needs to reconsider their place and life and also ask themselves \\"do I really know what the hell I am talking about?\\" if they answer themselves with a resounding \\"NO!\\" then perhaps they are not lost causes after all. If they answer \\"Yes,\\" well that is another story altogether. You see, these kids that review stuff like this are really just scared little tykes who have heard Slayer once or twice and the intensity just scared them off. They might never admit it, instead they would say that Slayer bases themselves off of Satanism to make them look tough so to speak and other completely ignorant statements like that. They might also say to a person like me that I am only kidding myself and that Slayer really is bad. Of course that could not be farther from the truth, if anyone is kidding themselves it is these kids with their sad little unknowing reviews. We adults know that Slayer is one of the greatest bands this world has ever been privvy to. Oh and Himo that was hilarious, saying that this album was made for idiots, then you say it was made over 6000 years ago...lol well obviously YOU'RE the idiot but you know, it's obvious so I don't need to say anymore except that you need to lay off the Limp Bizkit for awhile, no no, don't argue, you know what I say is right and that is that. You're an idiot, you need to use your brain, that is all. And to Bob, Eater of Poo, Judas Priest and Megadeath stink compared to Slayer, you're the one that's blind so how about you shut up? Thank you.
0385510438|5.0|I have read nearly every one of John Grishams books, and they have all been very good. He is one of the few writers now-days that really know how to write, how to develop characters, and how to move the plot along when it is required. This book does that, and then some. In typical Grisham fashion, the main character ends up in Mississippi ... this time the guy is a newspaper man, not a lawyer ... dont worry ... there are enough lawyers in the story ... we don't need another one. I do not want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say, I read the book in one day (and part of the night ... was up til 2:00 AM reading it) it is that good. The cliche \\"I could not put it down\\" is true in this instance. Get it, read it, you will be glad you did.
B00005JNTX|5.0|SIN CITY could be one of the best movies I've seen in 2005. Adapted from Frank Miller's comic books, we are invited into the world of Sin City. We follow three storylines. My favorite was the one starring Mickey Rourke as Marv. He was brilliant in this movie and handed in one of his best performances. Lots of big names in this movie including Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Harnett, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jessica Alba, Jamie King, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, and Brittany Murphy. The performances were all excellent. I also love the comic book feel of the movie, the direction and the overall darkness of it all.
B0009UC810|2.0|I love this movie. I couldn't wait to get it on DVD. But , i get it home and i can't watch it because of a defective disc. Same as the other reviewer, as they leave the Country Bunker it starts to skip around and freezes up in the Steam room scene and never recovers. i tried skipping ahead, didn't work. i will try and take it back today and get my money back or a different disc.    What a pain.   Also a  commentary track would have been nice.    update 9/2/05 I went back and traded in for another disc it seems to play fine, so i can at least watch the movie. I would like to add with the other reviewer: How about some extras on a 25th anniversary release!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab's \\"Plans\\" just flows.  When they released the single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" on the internet, I was hooked.  But when I received my album yesterday, I quickly realized that \\"Soul Meets Body,\\" as good as it is, is actually one of my least favorite songs on the album.    There is not one song on the album worth skipping over.  Even though at first I thought I wouldn't like the song \\"Different Names For the Same Thing\\" but then about 2 1/2 minutes into the song, the song totally switches directions and turns into a head-bopping feel great song.  The song before it, \\"Summer Skin\\" might be my favorite.  But I really can't decide, every song is so good.    P.S.  This album is best heard with a good set of head-phones.  With the volume higher than normal so you can hear how deep these songs actually are.  A good car system(not the wretched \\"I can't hear anything but boom boom bass) will do too, with the windows up of course.
B00005IC2H|4.0|This is the soul of new music.  Forget the last review by \\"music connoissieur\\" (hopefully you can buy his copy on Amazon).  200 CDs - BFD - I've got literally 5000 CDs and this one rises to the top of the stack.  Start here before proceeding to Mogwai or Godspeed You Black Emperor (I've got everything by both of them and Sigur Ros leads the pack).  There is much more interesting instrumentation and production happening here.  I especially enjoy the vocals - (unless the artist is Bob Dylan or Dylan Thomas, I just as soon hear a native language or false language that doesn't subtract from the emotional impact of the music). <br /> <br />When I head to the ocean to catch the sun and walk in the waves I grab 2 CDs to let my mind float freely away - this one and MBV's Loveless - Try 'Em Both!.  It hits that Robert Wyatt chakra where it is a bit abstract but still warm and emotional.  In years to come you will melt your Coldplay CDs but you will preserve this one.
B000AADYYO|5.0|A lot of albums came out this year. I maybe anticipated a few them a bit too much, and was disappointed as a result. Hence, I kept the hype for this album to a minimum. I've found this to be a sound approach, since it prevents catastrophic let-downs and allows for pleasant surprises. I'd have to put Ghost Reveries in the \\"pleasant surprises\\" category.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Opeth since I discovered them, but even with  all the appreciation I have for their sensitive and equally brutal variety of melodic death metal, I wasn't sure what to expect in this new album. The lack of Steve Wilson's presence as well as the decision to sign with Roadrunner (a label known for putting out a lot of mediocre nu metal and \\"hardcore\\" music) both had me a little worried. I worried in vain - Opeth are obviously in charge here.<br /><br />The balance between the songs at first brings to mind Blackwater Park, a fantastic album in its own right, but there's more to this album than Blackwater Park Part Two. Steve Wilson may not be in the producer's chair anymore, but his influence is plain to see: interspersed between the blastbeats and melodramatic classical passages are bits of psychadelia-tinged prog rock ala Porcupine Tree.<br /><br />Another obvious addition to the music here is the full time keyboardist (who I believe toured with them for Deliverence and Damnation as well.) While there aren't many big keyboard features, it has had a drastic effect on their overall sound. Throughout the entire album you can hear keyboards in the mix, blending perfectly with the texture of the guitars. The way the keyboards often work on this album also brings to mind Dream Theater, and in fact that influence pervails throughout much of this album (but if Dream Theater's technical acrobatics are a turnoff for you, don't worry - Opeth retain a tastefulness Dream Theater has not demonstrated since the Awake days.)<br /><br />On the opposite end of the spectrum, there's a good deal of restrained minimalism on this album as well. Chunky half-step thrash riffs pop up from time to time (but always topped with a signature Mikael riff to remind us he still eats hack nu metal guitarists for breakfast.) Coincidentally, they bring to mind Sepultura, the band that almost singlehandedly kept Roadrunner alive during the metal drought of the 90's.<br /><br />There's also quite a few serene and ambient moments on Ghost Reveries, particularely in the last few songs. Overall this has to be the single most schizophrenic Opeth album thus far; it contains many uncharacteristically positive sections of more rock-based guitar playing, as well as a handful of Opeth's most brutal blastbeats. It has moments even more peaceful and soothing than anything on Damnation, but is distinctly Opeth in its overall sound, and of course in the complex song structures.<br /><br />If I can type this much about it when I have only listened to it twice, imagine what I'll have to say after I've gotten a chance to really digest it. That will take a long time, as do most Opeth albums, but even upon first listen this is still an extremely agreeable listen. If you are an Opeth fan already, buy this NOW as you will not be disappointed. If you aren't familiar with them already but are interested in immaginative alternative metal of the heavier variety, this is almost as good a place to start as Blackwater Park was for me. And if you don't like Opeth OR alt metal, well... you're probably not reading this anyways, right?restrained minimalism on this album as well.

B000002UZ4|5.0|This CD is a good introduction to the Pet Shop Boys, but here are a couple things to keep in mind.  Since 1991 they have released eighteen(18!) more songs that have made the top 20 in the UK.  Also, CD technology has come a long way since 1991. <br /> <br />To get the big picture, pick up \\"PopArt\\", which includes all of the songs on this CD (except \\"was it worth it\\"), plus the 18 hits that came after this album was compiled, all in glorious remastered form. <br /> <br />After you do this, you will probably want to pick up some of the individual albums that these songs came from.  I would recommend the remastered versions that came out in 2001, which all include an extra disc of b-sides, rarities, 12\\" mixes, etc.  These are available on the Amazon UK site (www.amazon.co.uk)
B0000A36J5|5.0|The extended version of this movie is a must for those who have read the book.  The added scenes restore the parts of the story that were glaringly absent from the theatrical release.  They also make the story a little easier to follow for those who are not familiar with full story.      The statue of Golumn is nicely done.
B0000033P0|4.0|In the early 1970's, English progressive rock collided violently with the American trend towards 'Roots Music'.  American critics generally despised what they called 'Art Rock', and wouldn't cut it any slack.    \\"Tarkus\\" was seen as a low point.  Really, what the album could have benefited from was better art direction.  Someone came up with a terrible concept of a sci-fi battle between bioengineered monsters.  I still cringe when I look at this album's cover--only the cover for Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung\\" rivals its atrociousness....    Musically, \\"Tarkus\\" comes up a little short of ELP's first album, and it's not as good as \\"Trilogy\\", either.  But throughout all these albums, the playing and the production are first rate.    ELP were a band with a sense of fun.  The \\"Tarkus\\" suite is a little overdone in spots, but side two opens with \\"Jeremy Bender\\", with its kinky English bad boy reference to 'fisting'.    Side two is not bad at all, as \\"Jeremy Bender\\" and \\"Bitches Crystal\\" are strongly reminiscent of Keith Emerson's previous band, the Nice.   \\"A Time and A Place\\", as I'm sure is mentioned elsewhere in these reviews, quotes a bit from a Thelonius Monk tune.      It's too bad that ELP didn't pull out the stops and do a full version of a Monk composition or two-- maybe the critics would have been less brutal.  The musical reference to Monk--which of course went right by me when I first bought the album at seventeen-- is proof that this band could in fact, cut it, and were actually rather cool.      ***ATTENTION PROG ROCKERS**** \\"Tarkus\\" was included in the book \\"The 50 Worst Rock Records of All Time\\"!   I don't agree with that assessment,  I actually like the music.  But the cover art truly IS awful, one of the 50 worst covers of all time, definitely....and covers, like it or not, contribute to my perceptions of an album.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Death Cab for Cutie set a high bar for themselves with their second proper album, We Have the Facts And We're Voting Yes.  Yet they met (and possibly exceeded) this standard with The Photo Album and 2003's critically acclaimed Transatlantisicm.  While Plans may not be at this level, it's a solid (and at certain moments excellent) and logical musical progression for Death Cab.  Long-time or hardcore lovers of the band may be a bit let down by the album, or perhaps baffled by the quarter-length, dumbed-down version of Stability.  But all in all, it's an album well worth purchase.  Highlights include Marching Bands of Manhattan, I Will Follow You Into the Dark, and Brothers on a Hotel Bed.  Those new to Death Cab: I recommend starting with Transatlanticism or The Photo Album; both are brilliant and easily accessible.
B00061QK02|5.0|Wow. What a great supporting cast to the already hilarious Will Ferrel, my favorite actor. He plays the role of a news anchor with his Channel 4 News Team. Vince Vaughn plays an opposing anchorman who hates him. Ron Burgundy's (Ferrel) crew consists of possibly the man who plays the funniest role in the film. \\"Brick\\" says the most stupidest things at the weirdest times in a dull eery manner and it is just incredibly funny. When \\"Veronica Chapman\\" comes to the news team, Ron and her fall in love and start a instant relationship. But when Ron throws a burrito out of his car window, everything changes, just like he states in the movie at that very part. Veronica takes his place as the main anchor that night and starts being more appreciated all over San Diego at that point on. Her and Ron break up and his life turns upside down. Until a sudden emrgency comes up and he's once again needed by his former boss. This movie is as funny as it gets. Not so much the center point. But more of the timing of the senseless punchlines and meaningless jokes. Definitely worth buying.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|As a long time fan of Death Cab, I was worried about the jump to the big label.  Having \\"We Have the Facts and are Voting Yes\\" as my favorite Death Cab album, I was skeptical that they could ever top such a masterpiece.  Though \\"Plans\\" is a different kind of album, it is the only place Death Cab could go.  With the setting they created with Transatlanticism, they fulfilled the story with Plans.  Plans is journey through (In my opinion) Gibbard's most intimate and honest lyrics and thoughts yet.  The songs may be slower, the production may be better, but it always has and always will be Ben Gibbard's voice that creates the cornerstone for Death Cab For Cutie.  His voice is angelical at times and disturbingly haunting at others.  Overall, \\"Plans\\" is a wonderful album from an amazing band. <br /> <br />Favorite songs include:  Soul Meets Body (I know it's cliche, but it's a good song ok?), Someday You Will Be Loved, and Brothers on a Hotel Bed.
B000AADYYO|5.0|What can I say? 2005 has been a great year for metal releases and just music in general. Judas Priest releases a very strong return to form with \\"Angel of Retribution\\", the excellent self-titled reunion album from Candlemass emerges, and Nevermore puts out the absolutely stellar \\"This Godless Endeavor\\". In addition, you have great releases from Porcupine Tree and Avenged Sevenfold (I was quite pleasantly surprised by \\"City of Evil\\"). However, I have been waiting with great anticipation to see if Opeth would up the ante. <br /> <br />Not only did Opeth up the ante, they toyed with it for a little while and then pummeled it beyond recognition. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" reflects the constant evolution of metal's preeminent band today. Yes, they are more progressive (I would argue much more so than even Dream Theater is now, whom I also like) now but yet manage to increase their menacing heaviness and foreboding sense of atmospherics. There are passages on this album that give me the same kind of chills as \\"Demon of the Fall\\".  <br /> <br />I won't go through each song individually. You just have to hear it for yourself and decide. However, in this case, believe the hype. The rest of the metal bands the world over can cry uncle now because it really isn't fair anymore. Opeth are the undisputed kings of their craft.  <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The 2nd best CD ever. First being the Colour and Shape. also foo fighters.
0316168815|5.0|LOVED this book!  Alice Sebold is an amazing writer and has a serious career in front of her.  Well done!!
B00005JNTX|5.0|This flick blew me away. A friend of mine collected the comic books and I never checked them out.  But every week, we had to go to the comic store to get the latest issue.  The movie is totally awesome with the affects and the big name actors in it. Sorry, but right now, all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|So, I ended up with a promo copy a little early, but it has stood the test of time. I've been listening to this album pretty much daily for a week now, and it still holds up. It is a softer album than Transatlanticism, but I feel it is a stronger album. A little over-produced at moments, but it still is great. Haven't found a track worth skipping yet. I particularly enjoy the track programming on this disc. It takes you from place to place emotionally. It seems to be track groupings of two-three tracks with a similiar feel to them, but it all transitions nicely and is a great album to sit back and listen to after a long day of work.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this box set based on a friend's recommendation.<br /><br />WOW!  Buy this!  Watch it!  Love it!<br /><br />This is quite possibly the best Science Fiction show to be released in the last ten years.  The characters are real, the interaction is incredible.  The storyline is believable.  The use of the western feel on these frontier planets is sheer Genius.  It's too bad FOX cancelled this show before it had a chance to grow any further, but watch for the movie!  Serenity comes out September 2005!
B00097DX3U|4.0|\\"Out of Exile\\" is the second album by the new age rock band Audioslave. Audioslave is a combination of two popular rock bands form the 1990s, Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine. Three members of Audioslave are former Rage members. Tom Morello plays the guitar, Tim Commerford plays bass and Brad Wilk is on the drums. Chris Cornell, from Soundgarden, replaces Zack de la Rocha as the lead vocalist. <br /> <br />Audioslave's first album, self titled Audioslave, was a big hit with Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden fans. The second album, \\"Out of Exile\\" is doing better than the first. With twelve tracks and a variety of music types it appeals to many diiferent people. Songs like Your Time Has Come, Out of Exile, ans Man or Animal, have a heavier sound; like from Rage Against the Machine. Be Yourself, Doesn't Remind Me and Dandelion have a calmer, Soundgarden sound. Be Yourself and Doesn't Remind Me are my two favorite songs from the album. The Worm has a classic rock sound. The remaining tracks, Drown Me Slowly, Heavens Dead, #1 Zero, and The Curse have a new different sound. The new sound is the band coming together and finding its own style. <br /> <br />The self titles \\"Audioslave\\" opened with 162,000 album sales. The second album \\"Out of Exile\\" opened with 263,000 album sales. Audioslave has done the impossible by keeping fans from Rage Against the Machine, Soundgarden and acquiring new ones. Out of a 5 star rating system, I give this album 4-1/2 stars.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Vincent Gallo's The Brown Bunny is a masterpiece.  Its heartbreaking and totaly original.  One of the best films of the year.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Seriously, If you skipped out on this movie to see the Fruity Fantastic Four, You had better buy the DVD to make up for it. In fact, Get a HD Projector, and the latest in surround sound, because this film deserves nothing less. <br /> <br />Though it didn't follow Frank Miller's Batman: Year One to the T, It was very close, and the minor changes made...Fugetaboutet, They were great. I'm Hoping Nolan brings in Guy Pearce as Joker for Part II.  <br /> <br />Side Note: If you like the movie (which if you've seen it you like it) then check out the game on X-Box. One of the best movie adaptation games out there.
B00004U2GH|5.0|This record might say \\"YES!\\"<br /><br />One of the most unique recordings I know of. Recorded in 1969 (or 8) for a TV broadcast, riding on the success of his FOLSOM PRISON release a year earlier (also PISSAH) Johnny Cash assures his crowd at SAN QUINTEN that he's gonna do what he wants to do, and what they want to do. Sorry SAN, tonight these boys are gonna feel free (The best comes later when Johnny flips the bird right into the eye of the TV camera, the picture is in the CD booklet.)<br /><br />This opened the door for me on Johnny Cash. In my opinion Cash has a lot of hits and misses throughout his career. He's a country western singer, not really my type of stuff. Johnny CAsh though, at times, is EVERYONES type, and is no doubt responsible for some pretty F'in great songs. The best of which are on this disc. His band The TENNESEE THREE, really cooks up these numbers and they are all a little louder and a little faster than the original studio cuts. Some intense guitar twang makes these rockabilly classics like no others.<br /><br />The first twelve tracks are what make up the real album. These are all excellent. The two takes of San Quinten are very necessary because the crowd gets way more rowdy the second time around. BIG RIVER and WANTED MAN take the most rockin' award and STILL MISS SOMEONE is a surprising favorite of mine. Like I say though, they are all very good.<br /><br />The last tracks are bonus batter and are not entirely necessary, a lot of gospel type stuff, but what the hell. If you like 'em you'll be glad that they're there.<br /><br />I almost wish I was an inmate in 1969, man. That must have been a son of a show.<br /><br />DONT MISS THIS CD
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer, who has a degree in religious studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has in The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) written a concise and clear book. <br /> <br />The book is organized into eighteen easy-to-read chapters that cover everything from Muhammad the Prophet to the Crusades to jihad.  As the author himself says in the introduction, this book is neither an introduction to Islam or to be considered an historical piece.  It is meant to inform the reader on certain aspects of Islam and the Crusades that the author thinks have been left out of public discourse.    <br /> <br />As said before, the book is clear and concise.  The chapters themselves are organized into sections of text that have bold headings.  The bold heading tells the reader what exactly that section is about.  Most of these bold headings consist of what the author calls a PC myth.  Also, interspersed throughout the book are dialogue boxes that have interesting tidbits and information.  For example, there are boxes with the heading \\"A Book You're Not Supposed to Read\\" which consists of, you guessed it, books the author thinks you should read.  Other interesting dialogue boxes spaced through the book display the sayings of Muhammad and Jesus side by side so the reader can compare them to each other.  In the back of the book a notes section gives the sources the author used. <br /> <br />In the end, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is an enlightening book that readers should pick up.  The author's use of original sources (i.e. Qur'an, Islamic teachings and writings) and logic makes for a convincing case that almost everything you have heard needs to be reexamined. <br />
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I would say that I am not a huge Hugh Grant fan historically, but this move might start to change my mind.  The man was excellent in this adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel.<br /><br />Grant was hilarious as the grumpy single guy who lives alone.  His delivery was perfect.  I couldn't imagine anyone else after seen him in the role.<br /><br />Fans of the book should know that the movie deviates a great deal from the base material, but it is entertaining and well scripted none the less.<br /><br />The actor that plays Marcus was excellent as well and I hope he is still in the acting profession.<br /><br />Excellent movie.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|This is an outstanding CD.  I love every song on here except one.  Every time I listen to it, I find that I have a new favorite song.  It's being officially released in the US in October, so it'll probably be less expensive then.  I know music is subjective, but this is one CD that I can comfortably recommend to everyone.  Great music, lyrics, and he has an interesting voice.
6300181278|4.0|Dracula, 1931 film  It starts with a coach in front of a painted background. They make it to the inn by sunset. One man wants to go to Burgo Pass at midnight, the driver doesn't want to travel on Walpurgisnacht. The villagers are afraid of the legend of Dracula and his wives. Renfield the foreigner is not afraid, he disregards the warnings of the local villagers. Inside the castle Dracula awakes, and so do his wives. Renfield meets the coach and his destiny. Dracula bids him welcome (no servants to clean the rooms?), and wants to lease Carfax Abbey in England. A ship has been chartered. [There is a sense of dread and doom in these scenes.] The 'Vesta' sails for England, a terrible storm attacks the ship, yet it arrives safely. All the crew is dead, the one survivor has gone mad.  Dracula  walks the streets. A young girl is found dead. Dracula meets Dr. Seward at the opera, along with his daughter Mina, Jonathan Harker, and Lucy Western. They will be neighbors. Lucy left her window open at night, a bat hovers outside, then Dracula is inside. Renfield wants spiders. &#34;Have it your own way&#34; says the guard. Professor Van Helsing analyzes the blood scientifically. [Note the trick lighting on Dracula's eyes.] Mina has a troubling dream, she has two marks on her throat. Van Helsing notes an anomaly in Dracula's appearance in a mirror. Mina is sucked in by Dracula's personality. We learn about attacks on children by a Lady in White. Van Helsing tries to save Mina by placing wolfsbane by her at night. There is a test of wills between Dracula and Van Helsing; Dracula fails. Mina is now like a changed girl, she seems so alive! Now she likes the night and fog. Is it too late to save her? She is repelled by a cross. Dracula takes Mina away, will she become his bride? There  is a happy ending to this horror film (which has few comic relief scenes).  The concept of a vampyre goes back centuries in recorded history (5,000 years ago in the Epic of Gilgamesh). It represents something of human origin that becomes a human predator. [The aristocracy?] The historic Dracula was a 15th century Warlord (or Count) of Transylvania (beyond the forest) in Wallachia whose foreign policy was to prevent incursions from the Turks after the fall of Constantinople. A good history book will tell you of his domestic policies. Dracula was a contemporary of Richard III or Henry VII of England. The historic Dracula is a Rumanian national hero who helped to keep the country free from foreign domination. He was sent as a young boy to live among the Turks as a hostage and a student of their culture. (This probably tells you more than what you want to know.)  In 1897 Bram Stoker wrote the fantasy novel that made him famous. A mysterious and powerful nobleman from the Continent comes to England to exploit its resources. Was this a symbol for Imperial Germany? Its success said it met the emotional needs of the readers of that day. Around 1929 it was adapted into a Broadway play. Then in 1931 it was made into this classic horror film. I read that this film became much more popular when it was re-released around 1935 because of the rising threat of Hitler. Whatever the power of Dracula, he can be defeated once people learn what is to be done and unite to destroy this monster.  Could Dracula also be a symbol for the Depression which was destroying the well-being of families? One lesson is that those who adopt the life-style of vampires must also be eliminated, another symbol of an unending task. Horror films seem like a way for people to handle the threats and fears that they can't understand. That can explain the recurring success of &#34;slasher&#34; films for teenagers, or those urban legends. You'll need this film to better understand the 1979 parody starring George Hamilton.  I read that when Bela Lugosi made this film he learned the script syllable by syllable; you can often hear the pauses. This just underlines his vague strangeness. His biography shows he leda varied and interesting life, both in his native Hungary and after he fled from the counter-revolution. There was a Spanish language version made concurrently. It runs for 104 minutes, the usual time for an &#34;A&#34; picture. I suspect that this film also was originally as long, but was cut down to 75 minutes for use as a &#34;B&#34; picture afterwards (both part of a double feature).
0399152717|3.0|My first review included some pot shots at another review which has since been revised, proving once again that I shouldn't rush to judgement. Now, on to the review...    Kurt Austin is the leader of a semi-secret branch of an oceanic version of NASA (NUMA). When he's asked to track down a sunken cargo ship, he and his faithful sidekick discover monster waves and whirlpools big enough to fly a helicopter into.    The bad guys are typical of Dirk/Kurt novels, they are rich and powerful and they want to be richer and more powerful. To do so they plan to reverse the Earth's magnetic field using theories from a Hungarian scientist, who disappeared at the end of WWII. At least this time there is some complexity in that the bad guys turn on each other at various stages in the book.    The key to stopping the doomsday event lies in the granddaughter of the late scientist. Luckily for Kurt, she turns out to be a pretty scientist (surprise!).     Overall, its a fun ride, not too different from a James Bond movie. I do have some gripes, though. Cussler's interpretation of a super computer borders on childish. A talking hologram that flirts with the characters belongs in a bad Buck Rogers comic book, not in the headquarters of a government research building. Even Paul seems embarrassed enough to avoid using the hologram interface, too bad he didn't turn down the volume as well. Later, an 'extinct' species suddenly makes an appearance in a way that is closer to fantasy than fiction. If you crave adventure and don't care too much about realism, you'll probably enjoy the story.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently saw all of these episodes and I had never before seen any of Joss Whedon's other TV series.  This show is a very interesting reimagination of the science fiction genre, mixing sci-fi, western and even military ideas in one.  The most important thing in this show, to me, is characterization.  The characters on this show are very, very good.  In addition to this, the show is funny, touching, gripping and probably the most fun I have had watching a TV show in a very long time.  This is very highly recommended.
0743243315|4.0|I didn't expect much from this book at the beginning and yet became engaged by the mundane characters.  The characters come to life and some who start off as fairly despicable become endearing towards the end.  The book has color and verve and though the hard lives of the characters might be depressing, the overall novel is quite uplifting.  Highly recommended!  There's a film waitng to be made in this book.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These are not the \\"Original\\" versions of the film and that doesn't really bother me too much.  I'd like to have a copy of the originals on DVD just to have them but it's not really that big a deal.  We can't really argue with what Lucas does because if he says that this is the way he originally intended the films then they are.  He made them, not us.  So, with that being said, these movies look GREAT on DVD.  They are so clear and crisp that you will be surprised.  I was expecting something good, but this was beyond my expectations.  They look great and the packaging is great, too.  The set is very much worth it.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Yes, and this morning, when this album just came out, I bought it right away. I listened to it since 9:00 am to 12:30 am, and never get bored! Well, i have to admit that this album is more than what I've expected before. It's SUPER!! I am a big fan of Metallica, but I've never been this eager for a new album of Metallica. And yes, now I'm proud to be another big fan of Opeth. <br /> <br />I was in a death metal band, and was the singer, so I know exactly how hard it is to sing, scream, and play guitar at the same time. There are only 3 singers I really really admire: James Hetfield of Metallica, Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom, and of course, Mikael kerfeldt of Opeth. <br /> <br />OK, enough for the lecture, I guess. If you want to listen to some real metal, go ahead and buy this CD. It's worth every single penny (even if you have to pay $10 for the shipping, hehe). I love OPETH!!

This is a good read for those who want to make better use of AS2.0 and stop coding themselves into a corner by coding to concrete classes instead of interfaces. Moocks take on design patterns left alot to be desired but I have to admit that he opened the door for me to learn more about patterns and how it can make life easier developing in Flash.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I understand that these guys get some bad press for their appearance and the fact that they're considered \\"derivative.\\" I just want to say, as a fan who grew up during the eighties and who has a big spot in his heart for most of Franz's influences, that this band is definitely worth your time. They're good; being derivative is beside the point--at least to me. If Franz reminds you of bands you cherish, that's not a bad thing. If you haven't heard the CD, it is one of the few, of recent release, which is even. I think nearly every song is strong, and my only lament is that there are not more minutes of music on it.<br /><br />The best way to describing this CD is that it's a jolly bit of fun. It'll put you in a good mood after a long commute, which, in our time, gives it value independently. I was not surprised to read that Franz's favorite saying in regards to writing songs is, \\"where's the fun in that?\\" I've come around to their way of thinking. Profound music and lyrics it is not, but, compared to all the other pap produced today, Franz Ferdinand is a peppy shot of painkiller in the arm, which is the type of medicine most of us will gladly accept.

B00008LDPU|5.0|This little gem is a must for any Matrix fan.  It gives you a little bit more depth about the Matrix, but also has amazingly detailed animation.  It's fun to watch, and with the option to watch every episode or each individually you can rest assured you'll only see the ones you want to again and again. <br /> <br />It's also fun to see aspects of the Matrix outside of the usual cast.  As well ever wonder who that kid is in Matrix Reloaded that pesters Neo?  It's explained in the Animatrix `The Kid'. <br /> <br />It's worth a purchase, put it right next to your other Matrix collection and enjoy the expansion on the story.  As well enjoy it for its amazing animation, direction, and story telling. <br /> <br />-Dan
0060751967|5.0|OK, this book was laugh out loud funny. It also dealt with questions of redemption and forgiveness (but not in a preachy way) but most important of all, author Ms. Sparks finally has the courage to have a female character who is, dare I say it, average size. Yes, finally a central female character who is not drop dead gorgeous and tall and skinny. Folks, she actually eats. For a good time, pick this book up and enjoy.
B00097A5I6|2.0|The past 2 Oasis albums have sounded like a different band to the one that has brought us so much musical glory (probably b/c it is almost a different band. The band of flowing guitar rock with proud solo's has turned into a hippy group from the 1960's! <br /> <br />Despite the hype about this ablum I have failed to find a single track that would rival the songs written by the Oasis of old  <br /> <br />All the songs to me sound a little disorientated - whereas before Noel was the writer of the band other band members have started writing with not much success in my opinion. The fading charm of this once great band lies in the hope that Noel has one more great album somewhere inside his head just waiting to come out, and even the best tracks on this album are written by Noel.  <br /> <br /> <br />The Top 3 Albums in my opinion are: <br /> <br />1. Morning Glory <br />2. Be Here Now (Every track written by Noel) <br />3. Masterplan <br /> <br />If anything Oasis's last 2 album, Don't Believe the Truth in particular prove that no great music act is forever brilliant & that Liam is nothing more than a singer!  <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|5.0|One word PERFECT. This cd is sweet man go buy it every track is great
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I find it remarkable both that this show exists and the fact that I enjoy it so much.  I was never really a big fan of The Wizard of Oz, and what could possibly fill a three hour show about the land of Oz before Dorothy showed up?  It turns out that there is surprisingly a lot to tell about Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, Glinda the Good, and Nessarose, the Wicked Witch of the East. <br />The songs from this hit play deserve a lot of praise; they are able to both convey the inner emotions  (The Wizard and I) of the singers as well forward the plot (Dancing Through Life).  Nearly every song on this album is catchy in its own way, but they're all catchy because they are good (not because they are annoying). <br />The one change I would make has to do with casting.  While Idina Menzel is amazing as Elphaba, I wish that it were Ana Gasteyer on the CD.  Gasteyer plays Elpahba in Chicago, where I saw the play (and live), and she has an absolutely amazing voice.  As I said though, Menzel is by no means bad, I just preferred Gasteyer's performance. <br />Anyone who see the play (and most people should) will want this album.  While it won't make complete sense to people who haven't seen the play, that doesn't mean I am discouraging listening to it, but it works best as a companion piece to the play.
006072448X|3.0|Good prose style, crisp dialogue, nice pacing, but... <br />1.  Kevin is de trop.  No one is that unidimensional.  Author tries to soften the cardboard characterization by a few scenes in which Kevin is nice, but they don't fly.  As a result, he is a cariacature. <br />2.  Book is 1/3 too long, could have been edited down in length without losing anything and would be improved by some judicious pruning. <br />3.  Overwritten; author is in love with her own voice at the expense of characterization. <br />4.  Vapid liberalism (snotty asides about Republicans, gun control, etc. pervade this book) are gratuitous and subtract much from the work. <br />I would buy the author's next book in the hope that her style will have matured as a result of having written this good, but flawed, novel.
B000000H42|5.0|This CD is in-figgen-credible!! King Diamond has the most kick A$$ vocals that i've ever heard. You have to heard it to believe it. The guitar-work has the 80's style (well no duh.. it was orignally released in 1987). The combo of the power chords and single note rhythms mix w/ the drums beutifully. This is one of my favorite CDs (my other fav. would have to be \\"9\\" by: Mercyful Fate). If your into the 80's style of metal, or if you just like music, you will love this CD.
B0000057C5|5.0|Most people became Rammstein fans or checked into Rammstein after hearing the song \\"Du Hast\\" on the radio. That might be this German group's biggest hit single, but there are several other very good songs on here, and the album as a whole is also very good. And honestly, who cares what \\"du hast\\" means? Let it mean whatever you want it to mean! Or just ignore the lyrics, and listen to that song because it's catchy and has good music.<br /><br />Rammstein have always been a solid and underrated/overlooked band, because most Americans can't get past the language barrier. I'll admit, I couldn't either, at first, but then I started listening to it just for the music and I started to really like \\"Sehnsucht.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sehnsucht\\" is the sound of industrial metal done right. Rammstein aren't heavy on the synthesizers; they riff more than some industrial bands (i.e. Nine Inch Nails) would ever dream of. But, unlike some (other) metal bands, Rammstein actually have rhythm. The riffs aren't dominating or super heavy; they make a \\"chugga chugga\\" sound, which often makes the rhythms worthy of a toe-tapping. And sprinkle on some keyboards and bells, and the result is an album which is truly worthy of the label \\"dance metal.\\"<br /><br />The title track tosses in some beeping, buzzing synths in between the heavy chugging guitar riffs and thumping drums. There's a good, mechanical vibe flowing throughout this song, and this song also has a catchy refrain.<br /><br />\\"Engel\\" falls into a top-tapping groove, when the guitars and synths kick in, but this song is a personal favorite because it uses some pretty female vocals well.<br /><br />The beginning and end of \\"Tier\\" sounds partially acoustic, and the middle has more fast, rhythmic chugging guitars.<br /><br />\\"Bestrafe Mich\\" has riffs which are so chunky, they sound like slow buzzsaw riffs. A synth solo is included near the end, also.<br /><br />\\"Du Hast\\" has the usual guitars and drum noise, but thanks to the twinkling synthesizers (at the beginning and near the end), this song might be the catchiest on the album.<br /><br />\\"Buck Dich\\" features pounding, booming riffs which are great for banging your head to.<br /><br />\\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" begins with high pitched vocals and even some violin plucking, and then the crunchy riffs kick in.<br /><br />\\"Klavier\\" begins with some real singing and light, piano keys, but the big power chords and raised vocals make an appearance for the brooding choruses.<br /><br />\\"Alter Mann\\" has more repetitive chugga-chugga guitar work, but the drums in the background make an almost aquatic sound.<br /><br />\\"Eifersucht\\" features another very catchy rhythm, with grooving guitars. Most of the singing is deep and snarly, but there are some backing vocals which sound almost like laughter.<br /><br />\\"Kuss Mich\\" is, musically, like any other track on here, but this song has some animated and almost funny sound effects.<br /><br />The hidden track, \\"Stripped,\\" is sung in English, so it's surprising. Plus, the vocals are slow (almost spoken words), so this song is also quite creepy.<br /><br />So, it would be wise of you to get past the language barrier (or just listen to this C.D. for the music), because I've looked up the lyrics online and they're not that great. Other than that, though, this C.D. is solid from front to black. All metal collections need some industrial metal, and Rammstein do this genre very well, so all metalheads (and all fans of dance metal and bands like KMFDM) should definitely check this album out!beginning and near the end), this song might be the catchiest on the album. <br />\\"Buck Dich\\" features pounding, booming riffs which are great for banging your head to.  <br />\\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" begins with high pitched vocals and even some violin plucking, and then the crunchy riffs kick in. <br />\\"Klavier\\" begins with some real singing and light, piano keys, but the big power chords and raised vocals make an appearance for the brooding choruses. <br />\\"Alter Mann\\" has more repetitive chugga-chugga guitar work, but the drums in the background make an almost aquatic sound. <br />\\"Eifersucht\\" features another very catchy rhythm, with grooving guitars.

0393317552|3.0|Given how much I'd heard about this book, I was surprised at how little it had to offer.  Yes, he does tie together some important ideas about how civilizations develop, but the author is clear from the start that the purpose of the book is to argue that poverty is not the fault of the impoverished, and wealth isn't a reflection on the merits of the wealthy.  This is a point that he returns to so often that it becomes tiresome.  Any explanation of historical development that actually looks at the qualities of the players involved rather than at their good or bad fortune is dismissed offhandedly.  This is a political commitment that requires him to overplay factors in human development like geography.  The book is worth reading, but largely to show how academic presuppositions can get in the way of good research.
B00000255F|5.0|This is the best pure rock album ever created.  Why?  Because of the marriage of music AND lyrics.  FOR CERTAIN, you CANNOT separate Bruce's music from his politics - it's all there.  His lyrics speak the truth.  Example - the closing of the factories starting in the late 1960s (which most big businesses have moved overseas) leaving poor desperate blue-collar people out of work.  In, 'it's a \\"death-trap, a suicide wrap,\\"' you think he's singing about how great and wonderful America has become in the late 20th century?  By 1975, when he recorded BORN TO RUN the American dream was gone, over, finished.  This was just another country losing its power and leaving its working poor in the dust.  BORN TO RUN the title itself - is he saying that America is such a great and wonderful country that people are HAPPY???!!!  He's saying that things have gotten so bad, you just want to get on your bike and go somewhere, anywhere, even though you can't because it's unaffordable.  Every song on every album from BORN TO RUN onward tells of a desolate sad hopeless America where its people have been wronged and left alone to figure out how to live without jobs, security, stability.  BORN IN THE USA starts - \\"Born down in a dead man's town!!!\\"  If you are a fan of Springsteen and NOT a liberal, you're kidding yourself.  You must be listening to the music and ignoring the lyrics.  Living in a dream world has become a true red-white-blue American trait, it seems.  It's your job as an American to dissent, revolt, rally against the powers that be.  Springsteen has been that voice for millions for 30 years now, starting with this amazing album, whether they know it or not.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Well, it is not worth your time if you lose interest in movies that dont have non stop action or interrogations. This one, you have to pay attention to. It seems boring throughout the movie unless you pay attention and get into the movie.<br /><br />It makes you wonder who that fat white guy is and how it will end with the lady at the airport cafe. When you see the ending it will all make perfect sense, but then again, it wont.<br /><br />Then everything turns twisted and you ask yourself, wait what happened to *** and I thought they were *****, Im not spoiling it! It has an amazing ending on how you will tell yourself, \\"wow..ok now I get it\\".<br /><br />Well worth renting..But I don't think its a movie youll be enjoying frequentley unless you like psychological thrillers.<br /><br />Also, in the special documentary, Christian Bals said, \\"I just didn't eat.\\"
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I was VERY apprehensive of this lp after news that they made a complete switch from their previous sound, in actuality I was very &quot;fearful&quot; of what the outcome would be and be completely disapointed. That is until I listened to it. After two spins it started to grow on me and now I have to absolutely say that this is a solid, well balanced and, above all, a very good album. What makes this &quot;very different&quot; lp very good is that it sounds genuine, honest; and in the end, that's what matters the most... that and the fact that all tracks are solid.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic has always been one of my hidden favorit films, meaning, a film that i love very much, but being a 22 year old male, would never amit to my friends. Its because i studied the ship extensively as a child, and the film managed to capture historical fact and romance and blend them into a realistic story. Its always been one of those films id love to see a directors cut or extened version of, and because of that i outright refused to purchase the standard version dvd, because for such a huge epic film, with such a great director, there were no extra features what so ever. Im finally happy cameron and paramount got there act together and is putting out a 3 disc set. It should have been a 4 disc set like rumored, but, 3 discs is still 2 discs full of extra features (granted they dont cut the film in half like they had to do for the VHS version) <br /> <br />Im also glad we will have the branching option of the deleted scenes and making of included with the film. Its always nice to see deleted or extended scenes, but to see them were in the film they were cut from is always better, because one gets a better understanding of why it was cut,  be it for pacing, redundancy, or shere length. If it were up to me, all films put out on dvd would be required to have this feature, because like me, alot of film students can learn greatly from it <br /> <br />overall, this, and revenge of the sith are the two films i will do almost anything to have by the end of the year.
B0009P42S2|4.0|this was one of the most beautiful animated movies i have watched. everything from the entwining machinery to the fast paced action sequences left me in awe. the storyline was a bit dry during the first half of the movie with the exception of a chase scene involving a steam powered automobile and a train. you could just tell that the creators of this movie were so deeply involved with the way the movie looked that they somewhat sidestepped the editting process. same thing happened with the first final fantasy movie. overall though, this was still a gorgeous picture worth a look by any fan of anime.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Eric Clapton at his best?  Definately in recent years.  That, however, does not begin to summarize this breath-taking album.  It is a masterpiece, delivering what it promises: A seminal album, based largely in Clapton's own personal experiences with family life.  The album is definately among Clapton's best work in recent years.  It delivers a soulful array of fast-paced pop-rock, slow balladry, jazz, classic R&B, reggae, and Clapton's own homegrown blues as each song brilliantly showcases and proudly displays Clapton's legendary blues-guitar style. <br /> <br />The album features instrumental work from such luminaries as rock legends Steve Winwood and Robert Randolph as well as John Mayer, one of today's hottest stars, and Stephen Marley, the second son of reggae legend Bob Marley. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with \\"So Tired,\\" an energized, joyful, and powerful tune about the joys of an up-and-coming family even in the face of stress, followed by the lovely, bittersweet love song, the reggae-styled \\"Say What You Will\\".  Up next is Clapton's optimistic, rocking cover Stevie Wonder's and Syreeta Wright's \\"I'm Going Left,\\" and his mournful, soul-styled cover of the legendary R&B group, The Spinners \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\".  A similar type of mood is shown on the reggae-blues melding \\"Revolution,\\" with its hard-hitting and delightfully snide lyrics, not to mention the intoxicating sound of the music. <br /> <br />Again, however, Clapton takes a more optimistic approach on love in his bright, ballad-like cover of his friend, the late George Harrison's \\"Love Comes to Everyone,\\" after which comes an astonishing return to Clapton's hardcore blues roots on the dark love song \\"Lost and Found,\\" where we see the raw emotion and power that first made Clapton so famous.  He takes similar steps on the Jazz and blues numbers \\"Piece of My Heart,\\" and the amazing, touching, vivid, and heartfelt \\"One Day\\". <br /> <br />The quick, upbeat style makes a powerful favorite of the soft, yet stingingly beautiful \\"One Track Mind\\".  My personal favorite, however, is Clapton's emotional and deeply profound Jazz-blues styled ballad, \\"Run Home to Me,\\" one of the most beautiful songs Clapton has ever produced. <br /> <br />The album finally closes with the lovely, melancholy, yet still joyful, folk-styled title track \\"Back Home\\". <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Back Home,\\" is among Clapton's most heartfelt albums ever produced, based in pure, raw, personal emotion and the experiences that only Clapton himself has known; the touch which truly gives the album its heart.  This shows Clapton being himself, plain and simple.  And it's some of his most beautiful work ever produced.  It really is good to see Eric Clapton \\"Back Home\\".
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Possibly one of the greatest Alternative albums I've heard. <br /> <br />It isn't mainstream and is better then much of the mainstream crap.
0553266306|5.0|When you read a book and you just can't put it down. When everything you  read could be real, that's an excellent thriller.<br /><br />The way FF describe what is doing the killer and how is using and killing people in his path is unique. The plot to kill DeGaulle and its timing will thrill you all the way till the end of the book. But most important of all is that at the end of it you'll have two questions:<br /><br />1) It was true this conspiracy to kill DeGaulle?<br /><br />2) Who really was the killer?
0790731894|5.0|Despite the plot has been taken into screen so many times, this well handled and better written script around a group of terrorist fanatics who demand the liberation of an important leader , threatening an airplane with 400 passengers on board, is filled of histamine along the plot because it has several dramatic nerves to resolve.<br /><br />Excellent effort of Kurt Russell, Halle Berry and Sauchet as the leader terrorist.
B0009UC810|1.0|What is wrong with Universal?  Are they so cheap that they can't offer a second disc?  Imagine the 4 disc. LOR boxed set being put on 2 flippers!!   SORRY, flippers are a pain!  They are harder to take care of and are almost always of poorer quality.  HEY UNIVERSAL - IF WE ARE DUMB ENOUGH TO BUY A PENNY FOR A DOLLAR, AT LEAST GIVE US THE PENNY!!!!!!   5 star movie, Zero star DVD.  As far as the movie, this one has replay value like no other!  Crazy car chases, awesome music and Dan and John at the top of their game.

B0009I7O7U|4.0|When I first heard \\"Used to Love U\\", I liked the song, but it wasn't enough to make me run out and buy the CD.  Then \\"Ordinary People\\" came out.  That was it!  That one song compelled me to buy the CD.  I wasn't disappointed.  I love the production work on most of the songs and the fact he plays the piano.  My favorites in addition to the Ordinary People and Used to Love U are Number One, Stay with You, She Don't Have To Know and Let's Get Lifted Again.  He mixes the hip-hop beats, old classics sound in his music.  He includes songs that are about infidelity and but also about relationships and staying together.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of Alright and I Can Change are my least favorites.  I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg and he's featured on I Can Change. But the song just doesn't flow right to me. The CD is good and I'll be looking for his second CD.
0778320448|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I haven't read in so long because I have been knitting like a psycho both for profit and for charity.  I got the book yesterday at 3pm and it was finished by 11pm (and I have 3 kids and a husband to juggle around reading and knitting :))! <br />     The plot is simple and yes, at times, predictable but it was still a nice way to spend the evening (instead in front of the TV).  The book is very heartwarming and at times I laughed out loud, I also shed a few tears (joy, sorrow, empathy, sympathy). <br />     The pattern is nice, I wish it had been within the book, where it was introduced in context in the chapter, not at the front, but that is just me.   <br />     Being a complete knitting psycho, I also bought the companion book, Knit Along with Debbie Macomber for this book and the 11 patterns are FABULOUS.  If you get one book AND you knit, you HAVE to get the other book.  The 11 patterns are all very different, different skill levels, 2 by Ann Norling and one by Carole Prior (I have some other knitting leaflets by her as well).   <br />     ****Don't read the Knit Along before you read the book, it will be a bit of a spoiler as it gives away who has what baby and which blankets were made for whom in it.  There is a Sailboat Blanket that is simply adorable in the Knit Along, I have never seen another pattern like it, can't wait to make it up (but won't make the white cables, I'll figure a way to make the whole thing in \\"one piece\\", I hate piecing!). <br />     Great books, can't wait to get A Good Yarn, although it has received mixed reviews.  Again, if you knit or are contemplating it, buy the knit along as well, you will have a more richer and rewarding experience! <br />     Also, I plan on knitting up one of each of the 3 squares in the back of the Knit Along for the charity Warm Up America! project this week (before I start any new projects), I hope everyone else that gets these books does the same, especially in light of therecent Hurricane that has ravaged the south, I know they will need warm blankets and comfort.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab for Cutie might be one of the best bands on earth. Gibbard's voice is breathtaking and soothing. His voice actually makes you smile. The best songs on this cd are by far \\"Summer Skin\\" and \\"I will follow you into the Dark.\\" Such powerful songs!!!! \\"I will Follow you into the dark\\" is Gibbard's way to face death since he is petrified to lose anyone around him especially his girlfriend. \\"Summer Skin\\" is a great song for the summer especially if you are a beach bum. There's something about spending your summer at the beach and the end of it that affects you. Gibbards lyrics put it all into perspective. Sometimes the summer can make us do things that we regret and things that might break your heart. Shedding of your summer skin is a very depressing and beautiful because you lose all that summer fun in that skin when it starts peeling because obviously its fall and summer is over, which is a very depressing thing. It's beautiful because you sort of become fresh, reborn when that skin is shed. Summer skin parallels the old saying that spring means rebirth. What a great song. Other favorites are Manhattan; soul meets body, and Different Names for the Same things. Although Plans sounds similar to Transatlaticism, you have to love Plans because the aforementioned album is awesome. As is Plans. Plans has some songs that could be included in The Postal Service's play list. The great thing about cutie is that they are taking risks and they are playing to their public. With the success of The Postal Service, why wouldn't they sample a little of that sound? It's very smart of them. Being on a brand new label has not changed their sound one bit. I know a lot of Indie Rockers think Cutie is selling out. Dudes!!! Let the boys make some money. Stop being so protective and let other people listen to them. Jeeze!!! Finally,  Gibbards voice is the glue that holds the band and the songs together. If someone with a lower voice or a different sound were doing any of Cuties songs,they wouldn't have gotten this far. I foresee great \\"Plans\\" ahead for the band of the year.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Loved the darkness of this version.  Beats the comic book crap of the others.  Bring on the bats, the fear, the secret society of killers.  Batman is one of us, he is a vampire.
B000002KDZ|5.0|A classic CD from the early 70's, this group has a sound from <br />yesterday which is still hot and pumping today.  Their classic <br />and signature song \\"Suavecito\\" delivers a typical summertime <br />groove which lets you sit back and reminisce about days gone by. <br />The hard rocking and salsa swinging tune \\"Cafe\\" is off-the-hook. <br />This is a CD that everyone both young and old can enjoy and <br />appreciate.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|Many people have written reviews complaining about this, that, and the other thing (about how they did or did not buy the previous seasons). My response, what's the big deal?  <br /> <br />For everyone's clarification: This box set is meant for all those people who either waited (for what?) or consumers who are looking for that particular gift for the holiday season (someone who likes Friends, but never took the time to buy them on DVD) I own the previous 9 seasons, and if you're complaining about the lack of bonus features now, then where have you been? And even if for this box set did have an extra one hour featurette, that would not warrent purchasing it if you already own the series. As it stands though, there is nothing extra with this set, either than the box, which by the way, can be shipped to you for the price of shipping (and the proof of purchase tabs) if you already own the nine other seasons (and if you purchase the 10th)  <br /> <br />As for the product, as I have watched every episode of Friends on DVD prior to the finale season more than once, I can say with assurance that buying this is not a waste. There are very few extra features, and the video quality sometime suffers in earlier seasons (as was the limit), but the sound is spectacular throughout. The quality of the show, depending on who you ask, varies. Some prefer the former of the series, while others marvel at the latter. I myself prefer the middle seasons, but anyone who's reading this has watched the series enough to make there own judgement.

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta... even the name is solipsistic. It has meaning to the band members and no one else. To others, it is only a suggestion, and that is exactly what this album is as well; it is a suggestion of a story, a collage of emotional music, cryptic lyrics, and grotesque imagery that eventually builds to form a pseudo-coherent picture of a man in pain and a life ended. \\"De-loused...\\" is one of those albums that you either get or you don't; it's like \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\\", or Sonic Youth's \\"Daydream Nation\\". However, you only have to dig this album; you don't really have to understand it in a traditional sense to enjoy it.  <br />The story, as such, is one of a man who attempts suicide and ends up in a coma, travels through his own consciousness and, eventually, wakes up and rejects the physical world in favor of death. That is the official story; as far as the story the album communicates, one can only guess what Cedric Bixler means when he wails \\"Now I'm lost...\\" on the song \\"Inertiatic ESP\\". The songs themselves are brimming with dark and sick imagery- ecto-mimed bison, boxcar cadavers, pink-eyed fountains, hooks picking scabs. They are meant to communicate anything that the listener can decipher from them; whatever you feel that they mean, that is what they mean. Emotional context is the only lyrical guide. <br />Musically, the Mars Volta is a difficult listen; they are very difficult to decipher and deconstruct on the first listen. Many also find the Mars Volta difficult to share with other people for this reason. They are heavily layered and drowned in tightly-produced waves of sound. However, they are also one of the most rewarding bands to get into.  <br />This album packs together all of the disparate talents and wild styles of the band members into a cohesive whole. Each of the musicians have their moments to shine. Free-jazz improv pieces and blistering solos provide ample space for guitarist Rodriguez; softer songs allow emotional depth for vocalist Bixler; a bizarre bass break for guest bassist Flea comes off as incredibly funky and fun. Almost every song becomes a fevered workout for drummer Jon Theodore and keyboardist Jeremy Ward as they weave their sound into every inch of the album; they are truly two of the greatest backing players I've heard. I also really dug the dueling guitar breakdown in Cicatriz with guest guitarist John Frusciante.  <br />The differing styles offer great appeal as well. The blistering riffs, lightning-fast drumming, and chiming flow of the keyboards will please fans of rock and metal; jazzy guitar breaks, downplayed beats, and bass-keyboard segments will jive with funk and jazz fans; strange thrashing distended grooves between songs will catch the interest of electronica and techno listeners. Each song offers something new. <br />A new genre is born with this release, and it contains only one band- The Mars Volta. A novel release that comes across as an album for no one ends up having something to offer everyone, if it is only given the chance to shine.
B0009UC810|1.0|Ok, something's totally crappy about the copy I got so I'm posting this as a warning to anyone else who's thinking of buying this title or already has but hasn't watched it yet. Side A MAY NOT play on your DVD player, so if you've got 2 or more then try it out on each one if any of them won't play it at all. I've tried mine in two: one for the TV which wouldn't play it at all, other than the requisite opinions disclaimer and then I'd get a blue screen saying to check the disc, and the other player which is on my computer, on which I couldn't get it to work at first but then finally somehow managed to.  <br /> <br />It played just fine for awhile and I thought that maybe the problem was solved, but then at an hour and half in it started messing up again. The problem starts where the guys race away from Bob's Country Buffet and the other band, The Good Ole Boys, go racing after them and then hit the cop car and flip over. Then it carries over into the steamroom scene with Steve Lawrence and freezes there. Then it'll start playing the movie all over again from the opening showing the Universal logo and whenever I use the chapters menu to find the bad spot it of course just starts up again! <br /> <br />Now I dunno if this is a problem with just my two players but I also don't believe it to just be coincidence, either, and has to be a manufacturer's defect. I've never seen this film before and really wanted to, but to have this happen is just totally unacceptable. I won't be able to get a refund for this since it's opened so I might have to either take a replacement or store credit. Universal has really got to be much, much more careful in the future and triple check discs before they're shipped out to avoid anymore of this kinda crap.
B00005R2IS|5.0|For those NaySayers that give this movie anything less than 4 stars, are you off your rocker?  This movie was put together for $100,000, by ametuer actors and directors.  It grossed $100 million worldwide in the last 30 years.  It did this with few special effects, no computer graphics, no high paid superstar actors... It did it with a compelling plot, convincing acting, great character development, we can identify with the characters and their motivations, awesome vehicles, car chases (some of the best ever on the big screen) and stunts and it scores and A for creativity, especially the ending!  Just thinking about it there are at least a few of the most amazing car chases ever, only to be outdone by RW.  Aside from its sequel, The Road Warrior (which I would give 6 stars if possible), it's difficult to think of better post apocolypic or car chase movies that also have good acting and a real plot and character development.  Can you even think of a cooler car than Max's V8?  The other yellow and blue police cars are also so sweet.   <br />As for this one and RW, they were copied countless times which is impressive to say the least.  For the movies weaknesses: RW avoided \\"dating\\" itself by disguising the cars and clothing so it couldn't be pinned on any specific date whereas Mad Max falls into the trap of appearing to take place in the 70's due to the clothing and autos and bikes.  Some have complained about the dubbing.  I have both versions, which are on this DVD, and actually prefer the American version over the Australian version.  Either is fine though, honestly.  Some say the movie is slow.  In rebuttal, the slowness occurs in the middle and is character development, showing the bond between Max and his wife before she is murdered, to further explain why he goes after the biker gang to extract revenge and also to help the viewer like Jessie as a charater.  If you took that out the viewer wouldn't be able to identify with the young mom, his love for her, and herbrutal murder wouldn't be as powerful.  I think the film wouldn't be as solid if you took that part out.  Others have complained that the 'post apocolypic' world isn't nearly barren enough.  To rebut that, it's very realistic and hints at the gradual downfall of man. We're witnesses the progression.  Maybe some bombs have fallen somewhere else, maybe not.  It's never explained but it's clear that there is alot  of chaos.  The fact that the viewer has to \\"think\\" for a moment, rather than being spoonfed exactly what happened, it an asset to this movie.  The movie leaves it open to your imagination to tie it with the current world.  Maybe it's nukes elsewhere, maybe oil shocks have tightened the grip of oil and has ruined the economy, maybe it's a global war not directly affecting this region and most able bodied men have enlisted, maybe it's biological weapons elsewhere... we just don't know, nor is it important to the storyline.  Things are just really bad and society has decayed and that's all that's important. Civilization is in the process of decay.  There are few cops left (presumably they've been killed or quit and not replaced, or left to fight a war and Max stayed because of his family), the highways are dangerous and overrun with gangs most people stay off the roads, the police station is in ruins and a state of disarray inside, etc.  As for the viewer that said this movie was pointless, I don't understand his comment... This movie has as much \\"point\\" as any other movie.  It's entertaining and thought provoking. And, unlike so many others, it's got a good plot, good acting, and phenominal stunts and car chases.  An all time great made 30 years ago.
B000000W5H|4.0|Like most Stones fans know, this album shows the Glimmer Twins starting to establish their post-Miller image.  Leaving behind the 'Exile'-genre for more the urban NY sound with some added Jamaican groove, the typical Richards swagger, and Taylor artistry, this album has a slightly dated '74 sound:  With the period blaxploitation and other influences, Jagger's basically trying to sound Black (i.e., 'Ain't Too Proud', 'Luxury', 'If You Really', and others..).    Other than it sounding dated, the only real problem with this list is the song order..!  'Fingerprint' would have opened the album in a nice, high-energy style (like 'Rocks Off' on Exile), much better than the weaker 'If You Can't Rock Me', which would have instead made a nicer Side Two opener. Opening the album with this lukewarm rocker sets a weak tone throughout the rest of the album.       Likewise, both 'Next Goodbye' and 'Time' would have closed out the album, giving it a more polished and memorable feel (like 'Shattered' on Some Girls, 'Moonlight Mile' on Sticky Fingers or 'All About You' on Emotional Rescue, the list goes on..).  Again, still an outstanding album, but try this list order and see if you agree (* tunes can be moved around per individual taste)..:    Side One  1)  Fingerprint File  2)  Ain't Too Proud to Beg  3)  *Luxury  4)  If you Really Want to Be My Friend  5)  It's Only Rock and Roll (ending Side One on an upbeat note..)    Side Two  6)  If You Can't Rock Me (a weak opener-type song)  7)  *Dance Little Sister (brings the much-needed umph back)  8)  Short and Curlies (Why is this even on the album..?)  9)  Till the Next Goodbye  10) Time Waits For No One (Mick Taylor rules on this song!)    Still a must for Stones fans and fellow rockers!

Everyone go buy the album and if your one of those people who just came to read the reviews.. BUY IT! You wont regret it.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Just an amazing album by an amazing band. Par has added an element to the band that is very interesting. I love the lyrics, and there's definitely some kind of story to this album, I would like to know more about it. The musicianship is bewildering and the vocals by Mikael are ferociously monstrous, with everything you would expect from an Opeth album. To know that 2 years ago I couldn't stand this band and death metal vocals, but now I own 6 of their albums, and Opeth are one of my top 5 favorite bands. Awesome job by the men from Sweden.
B000063DFQ|5.0|\\"Piece Of Mind\\" released in 1983 captures Iron Maiden at the height of their powers.  Although it is underrated, (thanks to being sandwiched inbetween \\"The Number Of The Beast\\" and \\"Powerslave\\") \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is arguably Maiden's finest of fine efforts.  The group really made strides on this album, now being used to Bruce Dickinson's vocals and recruiting new drummner Nicko McBrain who is outstanding on this CD.  Of course this album is remembered for \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Flight of Icarus\\" there are many gems on here such as the opener \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" or \\"Revelations\\" written entirely by Bruce.  I found \\"Piece Of Mind\\" to be more melodic and accessible than Maiden's earlier stuff which incorporated some elements of punk but with a group as talented as this, thats not a bad thing at all. <br /> <br />The Enhanced version of this CD is outstanding.  Not only is the sound production better but you get access to the entire Maiden catalogue with song samples from each CD, a background of this particular CD, videos of \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", and much more. <br /> <br />Finally, this CD was ranked #7 by Metal-Rules.com for the best heavy metal albums of all-time.  \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"The Number Of The Beast\\" were also in the Top 10. <br /> <br />Up The Irons! <br />
B00005JODA|5.0|Great romantic thrill ride that is made even more special by the performances of Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes, who both give this adaptation of the John Le Carre book a real sense of beauty, dignity and grace with their on target performances. Weisz is perfection as Tessa Qualye, a civil rights activist who is murdered for trying to bring awareness of their illegal practices on the poor natives of an African village. Weisz gives her character a self-righteous drive that is made poignant by her determination and sheer will and she also makes her character human, not a stereotype, which makes her performance the more real. Ralph Finnes plays her grieving husband Justin, who takes up her cause and begins to lean of how wonderful his wife really was and what he missed during the time she was alive. His haunted performance is in my opinion his best ever and is the driving point of this haunting odyssey of justice, lost and self sacrifice. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes both deserve Oscar nominations for their superb performances and Fernando Meirelles deserves one as well for his superb direction that puts you smack in the middle of the story that is unfolding right in front of you.     Hands down, the best film of the year so far.
0380733358|4.0|I normally don't get as enthralled with spy novels as I did with Ken Follet's \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" The story started somewhat slow but then it turned into a page-turner of the highest degree. Although the plot dragged somewhat, it made up for dullness by the suspense and the seemingly unstoppable spy extraordinaire named Faber. The storyline followed the actions of Faber and his adventures in Europe during WWII. I found myself rooting for the villain in one chapter and, in the very next chapter, I would want the hero to come out alive. The author does a superb job of making you feel as if you are in England before the Allied invasion. The fast paced action and the unending suspense makes this a must read for any spy novel enthusiasts.

B0009UC810|1.0|Universal apparently just doesn't give a damn about quality anymore. I saw this and \\"had to get it\\" - despite owning the Collector's Edition released some years ago. But like the recent \\"Jaws 30th Anniversary Edition\\", Universal has put together a few new bits, and they aren't even that good. True, this is the first time the theatrical cut is available - but then the extended cut issued back wasn't bad by itself. The exact same documentary included on the first disc is here - nothing new about it. On side B you get a puff piece from all involved - really, it's nothing more than your typical EPK material. A segment on the recent version of the BB (with NONE of the ORIGINAL members from the film) performing live, featuring the talentless \\"James\\" Belushi - it's just a pathetic ad for the House of Blues, nothing more, and a shoddy one at that. The interviews reveal nothing new or insightful. You've seen it all before - they're lame retreads trying to come off as fresh. Yeah, I get it - if it's a beloved film, and its anniversary is upon us, just throw out a slipshod mash of anything and fans will snap it up. It is an OUTRAGE not to have a commentary track. For f___ sake, Aykroyd and Landis show up and record their thoughts for a few minutes of new interview, yet CAN'T be bothered to SIT DOWN TOGETHER and do a commentary?!?!?!? Either someone at Universal needs to be FIRED for not fronting the cash or Landis and Aykroyd need to be hosed down with scalding hot water for not making more of a contribution; besides it isn't as though either of them is doing ANYTHING worthwhile these days. There's NOTHING new from any of the original band, NOTHING new AT ALL. If you've never bought this film (or a purist for the theatrical cut), then go ahead - it will be worth it. But if you're a lifelong fan, this amounts to NOTHING but a SLAP in the FACE. Universal has totally FAILED - AGAIN, and heads should ROLL for this lackluster release!
0156027321|5.0|Interesting to see below that \\"High school student\\" hated this book so.  Perhaps it has to do with adolescent \\"reverse psychology\\": a book required for school can't be enjoyable -- by definition.<br /><br />Be that as it may, my daughter, a high school senior, writing her first essay for AP World Lit. and Comp., chose to write about Life of Pi, which she read on her own, not as required reading.  Although not written as a book review, I feel it belongs here.  In her words:<br /><br />While trapped on a lifeboat occupied by an adult male Bengal tiger, Pi Patel writes: \\"My greatest wish--other than salvation--was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One I could read again and again, with new eyes and a fresh understanding each time.\\" This book, for me, is Life of Pi by Yann Martel. The same book also happens to be where I got the quote. It's hard to write about what it means to me, because whenever I look for a starting point by thumbing through the book I get distracted and have to reread all my favorite parts...again.<br /><br />Life of Pi taught me to believe the unbelievable. Sure, it's just a story, to be read for entertainment. Piscine Molitor Patel, Pi for short, tells us how he survived on an ocean journey in a lifeboat from his home in India to Mexico. But that's not even my favorite part. Pi has a striking sense of individualism, and despite his family's bewilderment, becomes a devout Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. Why not be all three? According to Bapu Gandhi, \\"all religions are true.\\" Pi adds that \\"if there's only one nation in the sky; shouldn't all passports be valid for it?\\" After his ocean escapade, he goes on to double major in zoology and religious studies. Rather encouraging for me, considering that I still respond with \\"I haven't decided yet\\" to adults and admissions officers.<br /><br />Pi's tale of survival is sensational at times and completely fantastical at others, yet I was with him every step of the way. It was the winter break during my junior year of high school, and I was exactly where I should have been: in bed with a great story. Life of Pi washed away the indifference, at least temporarily, that I think plagues everyone midway through their junior year. Pi needed to live so badly, even when it seemed he had nothing to live for. So many people would have jumped ship, but it never crossed his mind. Not that I thought much about jumping ship, but Pi's story made me realize the true meaning of willpower, and how important it is to enjoy your life.<br /><br />Life of Pi provided me with a more hopeful, restored outlook on life. Did I love it? Yes. Did it change me for the better? Probably. Is it the only book with the capability to do so? Of course not. People read literature because each book means something different, teaches something new. Books entertain and take you to new worlds. Literature leaves written legacies of time, people, places, and ideas. Life of Pi did all of these things for me, and thus illustrates why I read.<br /><br />\\"I left town and on my way back, at a point where the land was high and I could see the sea to my left and down the road a long ways, I suddenly felt I was in heaven. The spot was no different from when I had passed it not long before, but my way of seeing it had changed.\\"<br /><br />Exactly.winter break during my junior year of high school, and I was exactly where I should have been: in bed with a great story.

B000002E5J|5.0|It is hard to believe that Shakira was only eighteen years old, when she released the brilliant, underrated \\"Pies Descalzos.\\"  (Translation: Barefeet)  We hear the wailing, expressive purring and beautiful instrumentals we have come to recognize as hallmarks of Shakira's versatility and innovation as a performer.<br /><br />\\"Pies Descalzos\\" presents her range as both a rockera and a balladeer.  The album kicks off on a high note, with the wistful and infectious \\"Estoy Aqui.\\"  This is probably one of her most popular early hits.  It has a combination of heartwrenching lyrics (longing for the lover who isn't coming back) and a totally wonderful, high energy rhythm section.  I believe this song was also featured on Shakira's \\"MTV Unplugged\\" album. \\"Antologia,\\" the next track, is beautiful, stirring and very sensual.  As far as ballads go, it reaches new levels with its smooth, slow guitar strums and Shakira's soaring voice.<br /><br />Overall, the range of sounds, rhythms and flavors is diverse and compelling here. Shakira even dabbles in reggae \\"lite\\" with \\"Poco de Amor.\\"  Though, it might not be for all tastes, it is definitely fun and reflects her youthful exhuberance and boundless energy.  The subject matter featured in the album is not restricted to the topic of love, alone.  In fact, the last track, \\"Se Quiere...Se Mata\\" takes on the subject of abortion.<br /><br />This is a great album, and, even though this doesn't even begin to cap off the potential to come, in the career of this remarkable singer, you get a real sense of her genius, her natural poetry and the great joy and passion Shakira has for her music.
0141439831|3.0|The book's introduction states that the literary types have an ongoing argument whether this book concerns social satire or whether it is merely a means to commercial remuneration.  Clearly it is both, but the style is clearly that of a serial.  In some part it is a contribution to the argument of who will have the better life journey, Rebecca (capable, and unencumbered by scruples), or Amelia (a simpleton [as stated by the author in the next-to-last chapter], and hobbled by a highly developed moral structure).  One does get a good view of life in England around the year 1815, but you would not miss out on much if you gave it a pass. <br />

B00079FUI6|4.0|Before I begin, I'd like to clarify that this is a review of the TV show 'Desperate Housewives', and not the DVD. This is simply because, at this point in time, the DVD has not been released.<br /><br />I am a self-confessed TV junkie, and every September I eagerly await the premiers of both highly-hyped new shows and tried-and-true old favourites. During the summer of 2004, all of the TV critics were abuzz about ABC's new offering: 'Desperate Housewives'. And, for once, almost all of this buzz was justified. After watching the pilot, I was amazed that a show as irreverent and original as this had actually been picked up by a mainstream network. The opening was dark but snappy (how often does a TV show begin with a suicide?), the cinematography perfectly captured the manicured perfection of the finely-appointed houses of Wisteria Lane, and the dialogue was funny without being obnoxious (unlike, say, any sitcom on NBC) and clever without being smug (unlike, say, 'Dawson's Creek'). The performances were also uniformly excellent, and although Teri Hatcher soon emerged as the de facto star of the show due to her prior 'Lois & Clark' fame, I though all of the other leads were fabulous as well (especially 'Melrose Place's Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, suburbia's answer to Nurse Ratched). I thought, surely this will be one of the best shows of the season. However, I felt that although the performances remained strong and the dialogue remained clever throughout the season, the show did begin to suffer towards the middle of the season. I do not want to give away any major plot points, but I got the impression that the unifying mystery (i.e. the 'who' and 'why' behind Mary Alice's suicide in the pilot) could have been told it 10 episodes, but ABC stretched it out over 22. In any serialized drama, there is a very delicate balance with respect to how much is 'revealed' in each episode. You must reveal enough to keep viewers interested, but not so much that they feel they don't need to tune in again. By mid-season, the flow of hints had slowed to a trickle; virtually nothing was being revealed in each episode, and without the benefit of the unifying mystery, the show degenerated into a series of interconnected vignettes that, while interesting, existed in a sort of vaccum. Fortunately, though, the series did pick up again near the end of the season, and did end on a high note.<br /><br />I do strongly recommend picking up this DVD set because, despite my minor qualms, 'Desperate Housewives' was still one of the most original and inventive series of the season. Let's just hope that the next season of 'Desperate Housewives' manages to pick up the pace while still retaining the excellent performances and wonderful dialogue.don't need to tune in again. By mid-season, the flow of hints had slowed to a trickle; virtually nothing was being revealed in each episode, and without the benefit of the unifying mystery, the show degenerated into a series of interconnected vignettes that, while interesting, existed in a sort of vaccum. Fortunately, though, the series did pick up again near the end of the season, and did end on a high note.  <br /> <br />I do strongly recommend picking up this DVD set because, despite my minor qualms, 'Desperate Housewives' was still one of the most original and inventive series of the season.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I liked this movie a lot (although vol.2 is even better) but I haven't purchased it.  Why?  There is a big special edition in the works with vol. 1 and 2 combined, commentary by Tarantino, deleted scenes, etc. <br /> <br />If you can't wait, this is a decent price, but I suggest holding out for the definitive version.
0446608955|5.0|Every April, Landon Carter remembers when he was seventeen years old in 1958. He falled in love with Jamie, a daughter of the town's Baptist minister, who changed his life forever. Jamie was shy and sensitive. At first, Landon did not like her but, there was events that made him love her. She made him know the depths of the human hearts and the joy and pain of living. <br />    Nicolas Sparks makes the story seem real, even as he makes his characters seem real. The plot is interesting and good however, sometimes he uses slangs especially the North American's that most people cannot understand. Part of the allure is that we want to believe that love can be pure and that good wins out in the end. This is the remarkable love story that will touch the hearts of readers everywhere.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I liked this movie a lot (even better than vol. 1) but I haven't purchased it. Why?

B00005V0X5|4.0|I am impressed. The production on this version is 100 times better than the originals- now you can REALLY bang your head properly. This has always been one of my favorite albums and even though the original \\"lesser quality\\" production seemed to just \\"fit\\" the album well, I am glad this version is available. This is one you can really blast your stereo with. My only problem is with \\"These Boots\\". I realize that Megadeth had no choice due to legal issues, but I would prefer the original Nancy Sinatra version over \\"Dave's original version\\" if it would have kept those damn beeps off the song. Dave's original version was awesome, and I am glad he added it back to the new reissue but I would almost rather do without than hear those beeps. Another plus: the liner notes are great, I won't have the other reissues for a couple weeks but I hope they all come with the same bonus.
B00008G8M3|5.0|ID4 is an awesome movie, taking cues from War of the Worlds, V, 70's disaster movies, Star Wars, etc...   but there is a really great 2 dvd set fox had out for a while.  It's worth looking for.  (Oh, some of these ID4 dvds are coming with free movie tickets to \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" but that come out a while ago and the ticket is meaningless.)
B000AADYRQ|5.0|this album is just amazing. i didn't think it could live up to transatlantacism but it has. it may be even better. not one song i don't like. <br /> <br />best songs: marching bands of manhatten, i will follow you into the dark, crooked teeth, soul meets body
B00000JLWW|1.0|There is an awesome set coming out soon, I think 4 DVDs of material.  Deleted scenes, making-ofs, documentaries, etc.  Avoid this vanilla version.
B000002AGN|5.0|Great Jazz disc, the artists were obviously way ahead of their time, and it is a classic that will be around forever.  A must have for any Jazz or music lover!!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|A slightly better than average movie, kind of a darker version of \\"What Lies Beneath\\" (Zemekis).  Halle Berry is fine, but this is far from her best work.  (At least it's better than Catwoman.  What was she thinking on that one?) <br /> <br />Some people really liked this, and it does have a few good moments, but as far as ghost stories go, I've seen better.   <br /> <br />Oh, if you're on this page to buy the movie, go get the 2 dvd version.  It really makes me sick the way Hollywood studios rush out a bare bones DVD, wait for fans to buy it, then release a special edition 8 months later.  I've now started waiting on every DVD.  If it's not a mindblowing SE on first release, chances are one will come pretty soon.  (For example: I, Robot; Man on Fire; The Day After Tomorrow; X-Men [later released as 1.5] and X2: X-men United [a 2.5 is rumored]; Panic Room; etc...)
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth has been leaving me breathless for years, so I was extremely excited about the new album. I was especially excited to hear what the influence would be from there last outing, Damnation. All of my pre-concieved notions were all thrown out the window and I was more blown away than I ever could have dreamed. <br />\\"Ghost Reveries\\" is by far the best album of the year, it's not even close...this album is the most brilliant thing I've heard since A Perfect Circle's , \\"Thirteenth Step\\". The lyrics are amazing, the vocals are beautiful, and the overall presentation sets this band apart from every other group on the planet. <br />They come in heavy and really will do alot to please the fans of the monster growl of Mikael. But for those of you that appreciate the versatility and extension of the bands melodic side, prepare to be captivated. The final track, \\"Isolation Years\\", may be the most beautiful, peaceful piece of music that I ever heard. <br />You will still get the same extensive song length that you are used to when it comes to Opeth. Most songs clock in at around 10 minutes, the entire 8 song collection ends up about 67 minutes. Any fan of Opeth will be extremely satisfied with this observation. <br />The year of 2005 has seen many dissapointments and letdowns. Many bands have been dropped off and left behind with nothing new to add to music. Opeth does it there own way, as always, and as usual, continues to blur the line between music and art. They further the progression of music with every note. <br />Please do yourself a favor and pick this up, you will cherish it forever.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a dream is based upon the equally great book by Hubert Selby Jr. who deserves to be noticed, as well as for Last Exit to Brooklyn, also a great movie adaptation.This film made a great impact on me when i went to see it in it's unfortunate limited release, as it still does today.I have recommended this film to everyone that i've ever cared enough about and only 1 person let me down when she fell asleep and i broke up with her immediately because of it.Everything about this film is perfection in my opinion.Yes the subject matter is depressing but so is the 6 o'clock news.The always great Ellen Burnstyn works her heart out to put in one of the greatest performances of all-time.After the Oscars gave the award for best actress that year to Julia Roberts i immediately stopped watching them, what used to be such a tradition to look forward to every year.Instead i woke up to the realities of that institution and have found more meaningful expression within independent award shows.Darren Aronofsky does a great job in translating Selby's vision to screen, after having directed the also very good Pi.Jennifer Connely also puts in a note-worthy performance, better than her award winning performance in A Beautiful Mind.One musn't forget the music as the soundtrack matches the film well.Watch the extras and the making-of doc.Watch what Ms.Burnstyn goes through for one scene, as well as a treat for Fangoria fans.Can't say enough about this film.Watch the unrated version only to get the complete vision.
B00000DGRX|5.0|the songs that they play on the radio are so good, that you know the rest of the album is going to be awesome.  You get the album home only to find that while the singles are still great the rest of the album consists of uninspired fillers that pretty much $uck.<br /><br />Well I promise you that is NOT the case with Machine Head.. Yeah you know Highway Star, Space Truckin' and possibly Lazy.  And yeah, you can air guitar Smoke on the Water in your sleep.. But what if I told you that the songs that you haven't heard are just as good IF NOT BETTER then the ones that you are familiar with?  Well it's true...<br /><br />My favorite song is Never Before, probably because if you close your eyes, you can picture yourself in a hole in the wall bar in New Orleans listening to a blues band (especially the beginning).  NO it's not live, but its sounds like something you'ld hear live. Maybe I'm a Leo is also great with Paice laying down some great fills, and Blackmore being Blackmore..<br /><br />As for the remixes.. hey why not.. You're really not paying much more for them, it makes you feel more like you're at the recording studio, and you get When A Blind Man Cries (which is definately a departure form the rest of the album since it is soooo mellow and laid back).. So it's worth the $4 more...<br /><br />This really is great stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002I25|5.0|Like most, i became familiar with the doors through the song 'light my fire' on the radio and was immediately intrigued.My first album was one of the greatest hits albums when i was a kid and they immediately became one of my favs, still to this day.This their first album is perfect, from beginning to end.Nuff said.
B000005RU2|5.0|Having gotten tired of getting up and flipping the album over, I finally broke down and bought this CD a few years back.  Since it was pretty much just an 'upgrade' to a CD I really didn't pay much attention to it.<br /><br />So you can imagine my surprise when I got home and found that they had included 3 extra songs, inlcuding Black Knight which has always been one of my favorites.<br /><br />This album is what live concerts are all about.  No head sets, no lip synched tracks so the performer can concentrate on their dance moves, just pure Rock and Roll. One fault I have with live albums are that so many of them are just a recording of the band ripping through their songs.  No improvisations, no changes.. just the album version played live.  This is definately not the case with this album.  Almost every song has some sort of jam on it whether it be Blackmore on guitar, Paice on drums, or Lord on keyboards..<br /><br />\\"Child in Time\\" is absolutely incredible.  I have seen DP in concert a couple of times and unfortunately Gillian never sounded as good singing that song as he did on this album. Another great song is Strange Kind of Woman, and then you have the classics: Highway Star, Smoke on The Water, Lazy and Space Truckin'<br /><br />Martin Birch, who went on to produce a few of Iron Maiden's earlier classics, helped record and produce this album as well.<br /><br />This is a classic, capturing Deep Purple at their best.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Although this isn't my favorite album from them it is still a great album from one of the best,most important bands of all-time.No ballads or filler,just important, meaningful, ground-breaking rock,with, most importantly, heart.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|first of all this album is different from the first and thats a relief that they dont try to \\"stick with what works\\"  Attack felt like the rebirth of those unearthly daydreamers i have been so keen to leaving in my cd player for weeks. i would have liked to have had the other members contribute more to the songs like i heard in the first album.(jared leto pretty much sings by himself the whole album).  i didnt feel that connection in this release like the first album. Don't get me wrong, this album rocks. just in a different way. i almost know that this album will be the one to get them recognized because it connects with the mainstream more than the first. But i didnt get taken to a different universe like i wanted. then again they were channeling thier creativity in a different direction.  youll either like the new direction in this album or be somewhat disappointed.  either way i cant wait till they come out with something again because i do think they are a breath of fresh air when they want to be. i wanted the final song \\"hunted\\" to last longer because that brought back the kind of feel i had missed.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Can't help but think of the question, \\"is it better to be broken-hearted,than to never have been loved?\\" This was a great movie about being able to erase someone from your memory. Michel Gondry(of music video fame) directs Charlie Kaufman's(writer of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation in which he also directed)brilliant script.Everyone should be able to relate to this film as i'm sure that we've all been hurt by someone and would like to be able to forget.The movie also poses the question,\\"would you only want to erase the bad memories?\\"My answer is, wouldn't the good hurt just as bad? This movie is one of a kind and should not be forgotten.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought the Wicked album becuase we were going to see the play and I wanted to be familiar with the songs beforehand. The album was excellent and the play was spectacular!
B00000JNO2|4.0|First, I'd like to say: I do recommend this album. If that's all you need, great. If not, read on:<br /><br />I found this album hidden beneath a load Christmas sing-along LPs at the local thrift store; originally, I was getting it because the cover looked great (I decorate with album covers) and it was only $5. I had just gotten my new turntable needle in after a long wait, and was excited to use it. I liked Skynyrd well enough, but still don't count myself a 'true fan'. I just really like collecting records.<br /><br />I put it on at home and went to make myself hot chocolate, and I could hear it start up. I was floored. This may not be one of the best-reviewed albums, but I absolutely love it to pieces. (I'm afraid I might wear it to pieces- it's been playing non-stop!) It's definitely an album you can just put on and not worry about deep meanings or hidden messages, and it's happy to be playing in the background, half-forgotten (except when you have to change it over). LP or CD, I do recommend this one. It's my 'sitting-down-reading-a-book-and-drinking-hot-chocolate' album.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|I'm sorry....i don't understand.  Am i supposed to understand?  Because i really don't. <br /> <br />Jared is definately doing this band for the money and not for the music, you can tell with this album. <br /> <br />I thought he was heavily influence by pink floyd?  You could tell on the last album....this one he seems to be influenced by the Vans   Warped Tour. <br /> <br />The people who review this cd and clamour about how amazing it is, probably havent heard the first album, and if they have they are just really stuobborn \\"die-hard fans\\" who are too obsessed with the band to realize that yes bands do put out a bad cd now and then.  I don't understand how true fans of the old cd can love this cd so much.  This album is a disgrace to everything that was 30 seconds to mars.  This album is completely unoriginal.  Their previous effort was a nice mix of alternative rock and ambient industrial.  It was a beautiful masterpiece. <br /> <br />I'm sure every emo/screamo fan out there will be soon picking up this cd, and their shirt. <br /> <br />Why?  Why such a big change?  The guitar riffs that are reminiscent to everything being played on mtv and radio, the slightly altered singing and the used-like wailing of a scream, do not remind me of the jared leto i heard on their debut.  It just doesn't say 30 seconds to mars to me.  It says just another band out there that sounds like everyone else. <br /> <br />They didn't used to sound like everyone else....
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I love this new 30STM CD. It is full of great new melodies and outstanding vocals by Jared Leto. I think with this new CD they went deeper into their souls for such solid meaningful lyrics. I hope that with this new release they get the recognition that they deserve. They are an amazing band and the whole world needs to hear them.
B0006L16N8|4.0|When I first purchased X&Y, I was thrilled, since you know, it's Coldplay, and it's been a few years since their last album.  At first, I wasn't all impressed with it, but as many know, it takes a short while until the songs really have any effect. . .at least for me.<br /><br />So it goes, the more I listened, the more I enjoyed, and the more I admired the lyrics.  Unlike the first two albums, whereas I admired most of the songs, there were usually only 2-3 songs that really stuck to me.  I think overall, this is Colplay's finest album.  My top 2 would have to be Speed of Sound and A Message.  But I'm still debating, because I really like Square One and Talk, too.<br /><br />This album has certainly satisfied this fan of Coldplay, and it only makes me more anxious to wait for their next live concert, which isn't too far away.  Definitely worth your ears listening to.
B00008LDPU|4.0|When Walt Disney came up with the idea for Fantasia, he imagined a film that would keep returning after a few years and show off latest animation techniques and styles. The Animatrix takes 7 directors of anime and contribute a story surrounding the mythology of the Matrix. However it's decidedly uneven as some are great while others are rather bland or just plainly suck. <br /> <br />Final Flight of the Osiris: Takes place before Matrix Reloaded where the ship Osiris discovers the drilling machine on it's way to Zion. It's visually awesome with realistic skin tones and the tunnel scenes look like the film. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Second Renaissance Part I and II: Provides the backstory of the films of how the machines came about and enslaved mankind. It's probably the best of the shorts and is required viewing if your fan of the films. 10/10 <br /> <br />Kid's Story: Tells the story of how Kid(that shrimp who kept following Neo around and \\"saved\\" Zion in film 3) awakened in the real world. Visually it reminds me of old animation with the blurriness and the lack of sharp edges. It's meh. 6/10 <br /> <br />Program: Probably the most anime looking and it doesn't take you long before it reminds you of Ninja Scroll(which makes sense, the director worked on that).  It's slightly better than the last one but not by much. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />World Record: A runner knows of the real world while trying to break the world record only suffering from the Matrix's rules which doesn't end well. Storywise it sucks and visually it's ugly. Definately the worst here. 3/10 <br /> <br />Beyond: A girl searching for her cat stumbles upon a haunted house, only it's actually a glitch in the Matrix which allows the kids to bend gravity rules only to have it taken from them. Another favorite of mine as its quite colorful and it's a really charming story. This was actually the longest production time for the shorts. 9/10 <br /> <br />A Detective Story: A detective is on the trail of Trinity, ahacker being hunted by Agents. Visually it's great as it as the film noir feel only it might be slow to some but it's a favorite too. 8/10 <br /> <br />Matriculated: A captured robot is conditioned to feel what a human would. Visually it's quite stunning but plot-wise it makes barely any sense and it's rather boring(and conveniently it's the longest). Feels weird for the sake of being weird. Second worst. 4/10 <br /> <br />This could've been really great if some of the shorts weren't throwaways. But with the Second Renaissance, Osiris, Beyond and Detective Story, it's still an experiment that works. Sort of.
B000AADYYO|5.0|The masters of prog/death/jazz/blues/experimental/avant garde/ EVERYTHING metal are back, with \\"Ghost Reveries\\". A 66 minute musical triumph. Seriously, this album is absolutely freaking amazing. Compared with awesome music, amazing lyrics, and really cool album art, this is one of the best cd packages, and after all the waiting... I took a drive out to coconuts with my friend, ran to the shelf, and there it was. I have never been SO excited for a cd in my life. <br /> <br />Into the car we went, and in went Ghost Reveries. First came \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", a staggering 10 minute Opeth song showing you that their power isn't gone yet, and won't be for a LONG time. First, a lonely riff played three times, and then your hit with a god like riff and Mikael's guttural growls (some of the best in metal today). <br /> <br />\\"Baying of the Hounds\\" is next, and it's another great song, with awesome lyrics (kind of evil actually) and a great opening riff, as well as a triumphant and appocalyptic sounding ending. Doesn't get better than that. <br /> <br />\\"Beneath the Mire\\" has a really cool intro, which I can only compare to a \\"metallic dance beat\\" (yes i'm serious). Then we get a quick little chord progression that sounds VERY triumphant, and a heavy, brooding doom riff soon after. This song breaks down nicely also, and features some wild and new stuff by Mikael. <br /> <br />\\"Atonement\\", and \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" are next. Atonement is the song many are talking about here, and is also one of my favorites. It's a very middle eastern sounding song, with a great melody. Harlequin Forest is one of the highlights as well, an amazing 11 minute song with some great vocals, great parts, and a Deliverance esque ending. <br /> <br />\\"Hours of Wealth\\" is a bluesy type song, with a nice piano laden verse and Mikael's hopeless vocals over top. This song is perfect for sitting in a bar by yourself. \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" is one of the evilest things i've ever heard done by Opeth (probably the evilest), just listen to those whispers at the end... eh. However, this is a fantastic metal song. To finish up this awesome album, there's \\"Isolation Years\\", a nice three minute song that'll leave you saying \\"damn, that was one of the best lsitening experiences in my life\\".  <br /> <br />I'm telling every opeth fan and metal fan out there now, Ghost Reveries is ALBUM OF THE YEAR! If not, metal album of the year. It's also a breath of fresh air, as they try some new things never heard before. GO BUY IT NOW! thanks for reading.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|You'll end up haveing to buy it a few different ways to get your use out of it.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|As a long-time fan I was pleased by this adaptation, sure there were parts that upset me, but all-in-all I thought it was pretty good.  I hope that true fans of the series will get behind the release of the DVD so that hopefully a franchise can be started.  Hopefully the producers may ask fans for some input next time.  Overall, a relatively bloodless action film suitable for families who liked National Treasure, Raiders, etc.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Pity poor Chris Martin, life has obviously been rough.  Blessed with being the lead singer in one of the world's biggest bands, married to an attractive Hollywood starlet, and celebrating the joys of fatherhood with his daughter just aren't enough to make Chris cheer up.  Fans expecting a cheerier Coldplay for this, their third album, have instead found them to be morose as ever.   <br /> <br />Coldplay virtually had the title of \\"World's Biggest Band\\" handed to them on the proverbial silver platter after U2 tried a little too hard to be That Band on 2004's \\"Atomic Bomb.\\"  Blessed with a knack for writing quality tunes, a lead singer that practically dripped sincerity, and a multi-platinum best-selling album that  made them international superstars, Coldplay were poised to snatch the title away from the Irish foursome with their latest, \\"X & Y.\\"  Though, much like the $50 steak dinner that finds the steak to be a bit overcooked and the potato a bit too dry, \\"X & Y\\" is not so much bombastic as it is tedious and boring.   <br /> <br />Oh, things start off well, to be sure.  \\"Square One\\" highlights all that is good with the band-atmospheric production that ebbs and flows, and a booming chorus certain to wake up any who might have been lulled to sleep by the sneakily understated intro.  When you hear this song, you could be excused for thinking that Coldplay had, in fact, actually pulled it off.  Unfortunately, \\"Square One\\" is the beginning of a trend that plays itself out throughout the album-the odd-numbered tracks seem to show an album that is interesting, well crafted and adventuresome.  The even-numbered tracks, however, show the side of Coldplay that borders on the insipid-self-indulgent and predictable ballads meant to make you cry.  <br /> <br />Case in point:  \\"Square One\\" follow-up \\"What If.\\"   Here, one of the album's glaring weaknesses-dire lyrical content-makes its presence known.  \\"What if you should decide, that you don't want me there in your life\\" singsChris, in full self-doubt and self-pity mode.  The music never really goes anywhere, either, which frequently makes for a lethal combination. <br /> <br />Things pick back up again with the New Order-flavored `White Shadows\\" and, later, the outstanding \\"Talk\\", a song built off of a guitar riff mimicking  Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love.\\"  I can't say with absolute certainty, but I credit underappreciated guitarist Johnny Buckland for that slice of artistic genius.  \\"Talk\\" is clearly the highlight of the album.   <br /> <br />The rest of the album ventures between listenable (\\"The Hardest Part\\"), recycled (\\"Speed of Sound\\" - see \\"Clocks\\"), merely average (\\"Swallowed By the Sea\\") and downright awful (\\"Fix You\\").  Musically, the band shows flashes of brilliance-witness the pounding rhythm in \\"White Shadows\\", or the grandiose chorus of \\"Square One\\"-but far too often relies on the standard Coldplay-lite fare we've all come to know.  Johnny Buckland is the real deal on guitar, and has become quite prolific at painting soundscapes underneath Martin's frequently dry vocals.  Unfortunately, the album is too heavily weighed down by poor lyrics and lackluster songwriting. <br /> <br />So what, exactly, is the final verdict?  Clearly, they played it safe here.  Save for a few shining moments, this is the album I feared they would make.  Before this album came out, Coldplay were obviously at a crossroads...the same crossroads that Thom Yorke and Co. found themselves after 1997's OK Computer.  Rather than take the obvious step towards pop superstardom, Radiohead instead released the schizophrenic-and anti-pop-\\"Kid A\\".  Critically adored yet not radio friendly, Radiohead won the respect of music fans yet forever removed any chances of claiming `World's Biggest Band\\" status.  Coldplay, however, decided to go for it outright, and release the safest, most radio-friendly album they possibly could.  The success of the very-average \\"Speed of Sound\\" seems to vindicate their decision, at least as far as the pop charts go.  But they missed out on an opportunity to make a truly great album.  Top of the charts?  Sure.  Timeless classic?  Not even close. <br />
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I am a huge 30stm fan, and thier first album is one of my favorite of all time. Like others have said, this album is much different than thier first. But atleast they've got the balls to be original. Firstly, this isn't a sell out move to broaden thier fan base, this is the type of music they want to play. Thier third CD maybe Emo or Rap, but you have to respect them for being able to say that they want to make thier style of music, no matter people say. Now back to actual album:the band wisely picked thier track listing to prepare fans for what they're about to hear. \\"Attack\\", the first track, is a mix between thier old \\"Space Rock\\" style, and thier newer style. Showing people that they're still 30stm, but they're a bit different now. The second track \\"The Kill\\", is the extreme side of thier new style. So you see the middle ground on track one, and the far right of thier new style in track two. Then, track five, \\"Saviour\\", is very much like thier older style, but you can still feel that they have moved on to something different. Either way, whether you love or hate ABL, you still have to respect 30stm's creativity, and the fact the they could do something different, when many bands would just get stuck in the same exact style, singing the same exact songs, for album after album.
B00002N9ER|4.0|These are the best...still breakable with normal wear and tear, but not too expensive to replace.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I couldnt beleive how touching this movie was. I didnt get to see it on HBO but when I watched them straight through, I just was taken aback at the end. It was interesting to watch World War II from that perspective.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is my first review on this site, I felt obliged to review this album because I can't believe it could be just 4.5 stars, so heres one more 5! <br /> <br />I was a pretty young kid when I started listening to Radiohead, and I think I can safely say this cd defines my growing up. I listened to it so often through the years whenever I was feeling not quite myself and OK Computer brought things back to base. I have a ridiculous amount of music, my Dad owns a music shop so I've pretty much got cds overflowing out of cupboards. Basically, OK Computer is the most listened to cd in my collection and it is the one I value the most. As for the music technically, it's just ridiculously creative and caters for so many emotions. It soars and it cruises and it makes you think outside of the box, the sound is unlike anything else in this era.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Don't expect Ercic Clapton \\"guitar god\\" on this one. Pick up \\"From The Cradle\\", \\"Journeyman\\" etc. if you're looking for that Eric....The Eric on \\"Back Home\\" returns to the classic \\"laid back\\" feel displayed on \\"461 Ocean Blvd.\\", \\"Slowhand\\" etc. This is a catharthic experience for Clapton, and his \\"soul cleansing\\" comes through in an honest and <br />soulful way. Listen to \\"Say What You Will\\" and \\"Run Home To Me\\", and you'll hear it first hand. There are also some excellent covers of \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\" (G.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album is so beautiful. Its ambient and ethereal sound melts into your mind without disturbing a thing. What else is there to say? Breathtaking, from start to finish. Go get it, take it home, spend some time getting to know it, and enjoy!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was originally written by Jane Austen in 1797, but it was not published until 16 years later. Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.<br /><br />The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.<br /><br />This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well.  Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read.  This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I woulddefinitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book.
B00005JKC3|4.0|HULK : <br />He's big, he's green, he blows stuff up, he has big muscles, and he breaks stuff. <br /> <br />This is what the uninitiated think when they think Hulk. Or they think Hulk Hogan, but let's not get into that now. <br /> <br />HULK : <br />The destructive other side of the coin known as Bruce Banner.  <br />Hulk is also what most people call a BAD movie. I guess I'm the exception because I loved it.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Ang Lee did and excellent job of making this film. The power and overall force that IS the Hulk was shown on the screen acceptionally. The style and imagery was great.  <br />Watching The Hulk leap over the desert in such large bounds left my jaw dropped the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the reteling of The Hulk's origin in this movie aswell. And the \\"comic book\\" style of showing \\"windows\\" with different scenes at once was great and made it really feel like the comic had come to life. I tip my hat to Ang Lee for making such a great experience. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a movie about a big guy who stomps stuff and yells and stuff, go watch Dragon Ball Z, okay. Because the actual STORY in this movie will no doubt bore you and you thirst for mindless crap. <br /> <br />If you are a comic book fan, it could go either way. If you're looking for a true to the books retelling of The Hulk's story, you'll be a little dissapointed. If you're open to something original in a comic book movie, this might be the movie for you. <br /> <br />It's very sci-fi, action, and emotional at parts. <br /> <br />+I recommend you watch it once to get your own opinion on it. While you do that, I'm gonna watch it again.
B000002GVO|5.0|I don't want to rehash too much of what already has been said. The Eagles at this time were Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner, (the underrated) Don Felder and Joe Walsh.    The Eagles (Frey and Henley) wanted to move from their country sound to a more rock sound for their 1974 \\"On the Border\\" album, for which they recruited Felder to play slide guitar for the track \\"Good Day In Hell.\\" Felder so impressed the Eagles that he was recruited into the band.  Joe Walsh, the already successful solo artist, repleaced Bernie Leadon in 1974.  Timothy B. Schmit rounded out the final incarnation of the band by replacing Meisner in 1977.    People mistakenly credit Joe Walsh for the title cut, Hotel California.  Don Felder actually wrote and arranged the music to the song.  Henley and Frey wrote the lyrics.  Walsh wrote his own solo (the second one), while Felder wrote his solo and the two collaborated on the dual guitar solo. The riffs during the song are actually shared between Felder and Walsh (Felder played a double-neck Gibson SG, while Walsh played on a Fender Strat). Hotel California, as another reviewer put it, was The Eagles finest hour.  It is the epitome of musicianship and (in my opinion) is the greatest song of all time.    Almost every track is a song of note.  Hotel California won a grammy for Record of the Year. New Kid In Town won a 1978 Grammy Award for Best Voice Arrangement.  The music for Life in the Fast Lane, a classic known for its awesome guitar riff, was written by Joe Walsh (lyrics by Henley and Frey). Pretty Maids All In A Row is a beautiful ballad, also written by Walsh.  Wasted Time and The Last Resort (an epic) are beautiful ballads that epitomize the the lyrical skills of Henley and Frey.  The other two tracks, Victim of Love and Try and Love Again, are not on par with the other tracks.  You can't fault the Eagles for every song not being a classic, which the others are.    I could repeat the praises of other reviewers over and over. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest albums of all time by any group or musician.  This was great real music, during the last great era of real music.  It's a shame that real musicians are the exception and not the norm today.  If you want to hear what great music is supposed to sound like, buy this album.    On a side note, I actually went and saw the Eagles in concert earlier this month. While the new lead guitarist, Stuart Smith, is technically sound,  the departure of Felder has left a void in the band.  While not in the spotlight like Walsh, Felder was the more talented guitarist.  His fluid and multi-layered play was due to his perfect timing, lightning fingers and awesome use of bends and vibrato.  He is definitely missed, no more so than on Hotel California, which is just not the same without him.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Will the real Ryan Adams please stand up. This might just be the album alot of people have been waiting for. Past efforts of his have been fairly different and rather spotty, but \\"Cold Roses\\" is no doubt alt-country, and is very consistent. In fact, I don't know how obvious it is, but I detect a huge Grateful Dead influence on this album, on everything from the song titles, to the artwork, and of course the music. Actually when I saw him recently I think he admitted that. I also think the Cardinals are a great band, and I hope they can tolerate him for awhile. Not every track here is a winner, but this is well worth it for \\"Magnolia Mountain\\", \\"Sweet Illusions\\", \\"When Will You Come Back Home?\\", \\"Cold Roses\\", and the great \\"Let It Ride\\". It's all good though. With this album, a cup of coffee, and a cool fall morning, it's clear that \\"Life Is Beautiful\\".
B00092ZL80|5.0|This is one concert that all music fans should own!!!Whether you are a fan of Earth wind and fire and Chicago or not....this is what music is about..it is about having a great time,feeling the music deep down in your heart....and that is what these 2 groups accomplished.Sound Quality is outstanding,picture quality is superb and the performance from both groups...absolutely impeccable!Buy this dvd.....guaranteed to enjoy it.....also,the fact that these two bands are on the stage at the same time to play each others songs,and do it flawlessly,blows my mind....not one false note,all the horn players were absolutely on,the drum duel was amazing,and the vocals were nothing short of perfect.Definitely my favorite dvd from my collection of concert dvds........and i have a ton of them!!!!!!!!!!!ENJOY...
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I guess I'm a little biased. Death Cab for Cutie has been my favorite band since We Have the Facts came out, and Ben Gibbard is quite probably what I'd call my dream man, and I'm a sucker for anything Ben and his bands do. I was one of those \\"noncomformist\\" high school girls who only liked music no one else had ever heard of, and my love for any music turned sour once the word \\"mainsteam\\" was associated with it. But because Death Cab is so profoundly genius and because their music still makes me want to crawl inside my speakers and live inside their transcendent melodies, I really don't care how \\"mainstream\\" they get...mostly because this album is still THEM. Maybe it's not lo-fi like the first two albums, maybe the production quality is a bit better, but this is still Death Cab for Cutie at their finest and I would recommend it, as well as their entire back catalog and their documentary DVD, to absolutely anyone who's ever had feelings. <br />Marching Bands for Manhattan is an incredible song, and hands-down in my top favorite 15 DCFC songs ever. The lyrics remind me of exactly what I'm going through at this point in my life [\\"Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole/Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound/But while you debate half-empty or half-full/It slowly rises/Your love is gonna drown.\\"] It's a great opener, evoking enough emotion to make you want to listen further. Soul Meets Body is wonderful and catchy, and I find myself singing the \\"badabadababa's\\" alll the time, though I never get tired of hearing it in Ben's voice inside my head. Summer Skin is beautiful. I Will Follow you Into the Dark is like nothing Death Cab's ever done before--just Ben and a guitar and some of the most gorgeously written lyrics. Your Heart is an Empty Room and Someday You Will be Loved are both very good songs. And Stable Song, if you liked the Stability EP (and I love it), is of course nothing near the lengeth and depth of the original, but still showcases that perfect lyric, \\"The gift of memory's an awful curse/ with age it just gets much worse/ I won't mind...\\" and is, in my opinion, the best way possible to begin this new mountain in their career and to end this album. <br />Will Death Cab get huge? That remains to be seen. And as a religiously loyal fan, I sincerely hope so. They deserve it. They work too hard not to be heard--and we all deserve to hear them.  <br />Get this album. Get all the albums. I don't think it's possible to be disappointed.
0140187650|4.0|I approached the book with a mistaken notion that the book was a formal analysis of evil using Eichman as touching point to focus on analytic issues.     I was surprised to find out the book is really a history of the destruction of European Jewry using Eichman as a counterpoint to discuss the entire German policy towards Jews, its relevance in a context of international war tribunals -- both moral and legalistic. Arendt weaves an interesting historical-geographical narrative of the holocaust, continually bringing Eichman into the Nazi policies -- what he could have know and not known, what he could have done and not done -- and his reaction to the twists and turns of Nazi logic and mass murder.     The end result is an analysis of a man who, while not standing for everyman, certainly points out how the mind of a person could engage and justify conduct in some of the world's worst crimes.     Eichman is no cut-out posterchild for evil. Arendt being brutally honest, shows Eichman as a person with human emotions who is clearly making conscious moral decisions on a daily basis: the problem of course is his role in making decisions based upon process -- at times Eichman focuses on how it is important to be faithful to the right process of shipping the jews, seeking to place his role as that of the shipper, since he never did any direct butchering himself.     At other times Eichman portrays himself as an admirer and potential saviour of the Jews -- he was an ardent exponent of the transshipment of Jews to Madagascar as new colonisers, he also believed that his actual role allowed him to \\"save some Jews\\", thus mitigating an even worse outcome. Such are the utilitarian and Kantian arguments that Eichman used, and in which he actually believed.     But there is also the side of the man who was distressed when he learned that trains may be leaving empty from transhipment points in Europe, when they could be carrying Jews and Gypsies. Eichman had to be faithful to doing hisjob well. That meant full trains. The Eichman that chastised his superiors when, at the end of the war, they wanted to save their own skins and mitigated Hitler's orders to kill even more Jews. To Eichman, these men were traitors to the ideal because they disobeyed orders.     Arendt only once uses the phrase \\"banality of evil\\" -- the Eichman that emerges is one of the person next door, decent in civil life, incapable of harming an animal directly without remorse, yet at the same time allows him/herself to participate in appalling crimes against the conscience of Man. Someone who clearly is capable of advanced moral reasoning yet allows themselves distance from the killing, by careful twists and turns of logic. In fact it is clear to Arendt that Eichmann is in some ways a problem for modern man and present certain legal questions that are relevant to the perpetrators of crimes against humanity in places like the Sudanand the former republic of Yugoslavia.    The Eichman that emerges is pitiful in the extreme. He is clearly not a monster in a rouges gallery. This is the most shocking thing that Arendt raises -- his seeming \\"normalness\\". Arendt even writes in such a way that we seem to feel a sympathy for this man (surely there was some mitigating circumstance --- one needed to be a beastly rouge to commit these murders -- Eichman is not that!). Sadly that is the very point that Arendt is making -- one need not be born into evil, nor ascribe to it ends (as certain Nazi's most certainly did), one merely had to allow oneself through a series of bad decisions, ambition, casuistry, and weak personality to be a functionnaire for the greatest killing machine in history.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Long Live Rock And Roll ends a trilogy of spectacular Rainbow albums.  Rainbow along with Thin Lizzy and a few others, are probably the most underrated \\"classic\\" rock bands of the 70s who had to sit by while schmucks like Led Zeppelin and Kiss hogged the limelight(and still do for that matter).  Listening to this, it all becomes much clearer where alot of today's metal sound came from...European metal that is, I doubt Korn have ever heard of Rainbow.  In my opinion, Rainbow is the best music Dio and Blackmore have ever done, and it's such a pity they only did three albums together(not including the live one).  Unfortunately Blackmore fell into the mindset that he needed that commercial success.  I guess he wasn't content with the fact that he had made three fabulous rock albums.  So, Dio's out, some other schmucks come in, and Rainbow goes AOR.  Ironically enough, Blackmore has come full circle in recent years.  Now he seems to care not about hit singles and has gone back to a medieval sound in a big way.  Too bad he wasn't thinking along these lines right before Down To Earth.  So, if you like Dio(and what normal God-fearing red-blooded american doesn't?), Richie Blackmore, classic rock or European power metal, I can't see why you wouldn't own this.
B000002LK1|5.0|This CD marked a pinacle time for Depeche Mode... labeling them as a genre all to themselves.  I love the sound and their conviction of smooth electronica mixed with guitar riffs and loads of melody.  David's vocal style is the icing on this cake.
B00005ATQM|5.0|I am not here to give an intensive review of this great masterpeice by Metallica. But this album is considered by many critics as Metallica's equvalent to Darkside of the Moon in terms of the best album they ever made. Although personally my top 5 favorite songs of Metallica are not in this album. But as a whole it is a very good one. It contains Metallica's best songwriting.  Getting the DVD audio version of this album for me is a must. The disc comes in two sound formats.The 5.1 aspect allows you to hear the album in multi channel format therefore giving the feeling that the band is performing around you. This format can be played with any dvd player. Although not a necessity this format is best with a 5.1 speaker system. If you have a dvd audio player you do not need a 5.1 speaker system because this allows you to listen to the music in high fidelity quality sound at 24/96 meaning a 24-bit sample size taken at a rate of 96,000 samples per second.This will blow you away.The real advantage of the DVD-Audio version of this album specification over the CD version is in the significantly increased quality of the PCM audio format or \\"Pulse-Coded-Modulation\\".With a Sample Size of 24 bits and a Sample Rate of 192KHz (24/192),this  DVD-Audio album is capable of audio signal with a frequency range of 0 to 96KHz with a dynamic range of 144dB.<br /> Listening to the dvd audio version will give the listener a different audio enjoyment and  perspective of the album.  Getting this album in dvd audio is must, not just for Metallica Fans, but for all lovers of heavy metal music.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I really like this cd.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, it does take some time to get used to but it's worth it because there are some brilliant songs on it.  I'd have to say my favourite is Speed of Sound.  To me I find it haunting sort of.  I love Talk and then Twisted Logic.  That song has a really great, powerful chorus.  I think this is better than A Rush Of Blood To The Head, but I guess that's up for debate.  This cd has been worth the wait.  It also doesn't hurt that Chris is quite easy on the eyes.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith's filmmaking debut, \\"Clerks\\" is an interesting film filled with interesting characters and situations. While it does have some un-needed moments (mostly involving sex), the film is funny, especially the moments with Jay and Silent Bob. The cast does a fine job, and Smith's direction shows the sign of a unique filmmaker. Definitley worth a look or two. Snootch to the Noonch!<br /><br />Movie Grade: A-
0783240287|4.0|I believe this is the strongest theatrical piece ever created by Rice and Webber working together or separately, so they started in strong fashion right out of the box. This film version of the play milked every bit of potential charm from the script and music, and did so with a fairly small budget. There are times when the camera and player blocking are not doing enough. The performances are thoroughly entertaining throughout and very tongue-in-cheek, and Don Osmond does a first class musical theater interpretation of Joseph, both vocally and in what the audience gets to watch. Here's the sad part of this production -- the audio mix is awful. You notice this at the very top of the show as the kids are entering the auditorium. The ambient sound of all this is way down near the noise level of the DVD, and it's difficult to figure why, because at the moment no other audio is happening. Later on, you discover that solo voices are mixed at a much higher level than the choral parts, even when there is no solo accompanying the chorus. The chorus should ALWAYS be mixed hotter than the solo. Many voices are always louder than one. The instrumental backing is also frequently mixed far in the background. The producers of this DVD should remix this track full of very poor choices and re-release with the new mix. The poor mix soils an otherwise polished production.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ghost Reveries clearly confirms that Opeth are still in the game and slightly ahead of their time. Pushing the envelope once again, breaking barriers, and stereotypes of what metal is. What I love about Akerfeldt is that he evidently doesn't care what you think metal is. His goal is clearly stated. He wants to write good music. Mission accomplished Mikael.<br />This album shows shadows of passed Opeth as well as new dark paths which is a damn good sign. What I'll never be able to understand is how some fans want bands to release a certain album over and over again. If the band doesn't, the fans then claim \\"I don't like it because it doesn't sound like a previous album or style\\". I'd rather hear something new and experimental from a band. It shows that there's no stagnation which only leads to a listeners boredome. However I suppose a lot of people like that safe place of listening to the same thing over and over from a band. Experimentation allows growth for the artist. Exception: the now mainstream Metallica. I saw them running out of gas with the release of the \\"Black\\" album and the invocation of a plastic producer. Opeth experiment just nicely. Never straying too far from there roots but dip into new realms for that growth I'm referancing.<br />I'm not going to disect Ghost Reveries. A Review is just an opinion from one individual. To criticize it for better or worse doesn't make sense for a band like Opeth. Any fan knows there music isn't easily digestable upon first listen. It's too intricate and lengthy. So the number of stars I gave it speak for how I feel about the album and the band. Let's put it this way shall we-as I type this, my newly aquired Ghost Reveries is on it's 3rd spin. Each time I love it more and more.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|The plot was more twisted and looping than a bowl of spaghetti - and not in a good way. I swear that Pen&eacute;lope Cruz could not make up her mind on what accent to try and fake.  Am I ghetto French?  Perhaps I'll try an African/English hint.  Ooh - lets go for .....<br /><br />Dirk - well, he resembled the Dirk we know from the novels in one way - the name.  That's it.<br /><br />Al - Could they have picked a worse person to play him?  Instead of being a wise-cracking rock-solid individual, he's a blithering idiot that looks like a surfer-bar reject. Look at the CD cover - see the dimwit on the right? What do you think?<br /><br />Sandecker was passable, but 50 lbs too light and a little too swishy.<br /><br />The entire film is an exercise in miscsasting.  Sore, if you've never read the books, you'll think this is an OK move.  Weak plot, poorly executed, badly acted, but passable. The opening scene was well done with believable SFX.  Unfortunately the rest on the movie did not even come close.  I found myself using the >> control many, many times to get past the weakest moments, so at least I was able to enjoy this as a 40 minute movie.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|When Andy Dufresne, a young and successful banker, discovers his wife in bed with another man his life takes a dramatic turn for the worse. When the lovers' bodies are discovered, shot repeatedly with bullets from a gun linked to Andy, he becomes wrongly imprisoned. Sent to a maximum security prison run by a corrupt and over-zealous religious warden he struggles to hang on to hope of returning to the outside world and reclaiming a sense of normality. After a period of isolation he finally approaches one of the other inmates, a convict called Red who is the only person in Shawshank Prison guilty of their crime. What begins as a business partnership between two characters, who would be unlikely to cross paths in the real world, quickly turns into a lifelong friendship. Together they manage to fight impossible odds to survive and prove that both hope and the possibility for redemption never die. <br />  <br />I have heard many people rave about `The Shawshank Redemption' over the years but have only just gotten around to watching it myself, and the praise heaped upon this film scarcely do it justice. This is not just the story of a man wrongly imprisoned, or the astonishing reality of life behind bars, but an emotional drama which reels you in from the onset. The movie is quite lengthy however I found myself unable to press the stop button as the level of interest was maintained steadily throughout, and I kept wanting to \\"watch a bit more\\". It has been a long time since I have actually cried while watching a film or sat on the edge of my seat literally in suspense, but `The Shawshank Redemption' managed to make me do both. <br />  <br />The characters are what make this movie brilliant and the casting of Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy was spot on. They managed to convince me that I was watching real life and actual circumstances rather than just a realistic portrayal of the prison world. Their reactions and behaviour were original but suited the film, and really highlighted how easy it can be to become a victim but that you do not have to accept that role forever.  <br />  <br />I felt inspired by the ideas raised and loved how my mind was encouraged to consider certain beliefs and rules in society. This movie challenges some of the toughest issues facing us in the modern age, even though the film was set over a period from the 1940's - 1980's. Frank Darabont has produced an excellent movie which does not disappoint in any way. I would recommend `The Shawshank Redemption' to anyone over the age of about 15 as a brilliant and enlightening drama.  <br />
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Yes, A Beautiful Lie displays a different 30STM than that of their self-titled release.  It's still some really good music though.  The title track is great.  Look for Leto to show Kurt Cobain a little respect with the opening line to The Fantasy (also the opening line of Teen Spirit).  The two bonus tracks are a little more like the 2002 30STM and deserve repeat listening.    The biggest problem with the CD is the format of the disc.  It seems that Virgin Records has this little thing called \\"Copy Protection.\\"  If its job is to completely prevent anyone from illegally copying the music, then it does its job . . . and more.  For those of you with iTunes and and iPod, start searching the sharing networks for these tracks since you can't play the CD in iTunes (which means you can't load it onto your iPod).  It's a shame to see a company alienate such a huge audience (the iPod Generation) and it works against a band still trying to find its break and against an industry trying to refind its footing.  Yes, there are ways around the \\"Copy Protection,\\" but you shouldn't have to ask permission or fight to play music you paid for on your player of choice.
B000063DFN|5.0|In 1984 Iron Maiden released their 5th studio album. This is simply the one of best metal albums ever put out.    This is easily one of the best Maiden album and it's their 2nd most popular album (next to NOTB). Along with that album this is my favorite IM album. The songwriting was slightly better in 'Number' and 'Piece', but this the instrumentalists never sounded better on any other album. Those 2 are both excellent, in fact everything by Maiden is great (go ahead and laugh, but I also like the Blaze albums). This album has some of the most amazing dual-guitar work I've ever heard, excellent drums, basslines, vocals and production. Everything here is perfect, there is no one weak track on the album. If I have any complaints, they would be that metal goes only downhill from this point, the other one is that this album doesn't get the popularity it deserves.    The Lineup:  Bruce Dickinson - Vocals  Steve Harris - Bass  Dave Murray - Guitars  Adrian Smith - Guitars  Nicko McBrain - Drums    Now to the songs...    Aces High: One of the most complex songs to play, no seriously, fast riffs, great solo, soaring vocals and excellent drum beats. This is one of the strongest album openers ever and the heaviest song on the album. MUST LISTEN.    2 Minutes to Midnight: This is the song that hooked me to Maiden, and it's the biggest hit off the album. It's not as complex as Aces High, but still one of the most amazing songs ever. MUST LISTEN.    Losfer Words: This is probably the best Maiden's instrumental. While it's not that long, still complex instrumental work and great solo too. Steve's basslines also really shine here. MUST LISTEN.    Flash of the Blade: Wow what a great intro! Excellent dual guitar attack and vocals are in top notch. MUST LISTEN.    The Duellists: Mostly an instrumental track, great riffs, also the vocal parts are great and great solo. Oh and one more thing I should point out is that people need to stop bitchin about that the riffs are recycled from Losfer Words, this sounds nothing like it and it's not even the same riffs, people... MUST LISTEN.    Back in the Village: Very underrated. This has some of the best riffs here and it's quite heavy. Adrian & Dave really deliver here. MUST LISTEN.    Powerslave: Another highlight. Has great egyptian feel and also a fan favorite. The 1:30 mins solo is bad@$$, worth alone the price of the album. MUST LISTEN.    Rime of the Ancient Mariner: You haven't lived till you heard this song. It's an 13:30 mins epic. No single moment here is boring and the interlude is great also. The best solo from the album. This is THE best Maiden song, tied with Hallowed Be Thy Name and one of the best of all time. MUST LISTEN.    As you see all tracks are MUST LISTEN. Why? They all rule, period.    There you have it. The most amazing and underrated album ever. Any metal (I'm not talking of that nu-metal garbage) collection without this isn't complete. Anyway, if you want a good introduction for THE GREATEST metal band of all time, start here.    UP THE IRONS!!!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I have to admit, being a die-hard fan of 30 Seconds To Mars' debut album, that I didn't immediately respond in the most positive way to the new material.  However, I eventually stopped comparing A Beautiful Lie to the S/T, and do you know what I discovered?  That I was holding one of the best rock CDs of the year.  While the sound of 30 Seconds To Mars has changed and become more mainstream, they haven't forgotten how to do it better than everyone else.   <br /> <br />From the blistering opening track 'Attack' through the haunting melodies of 'Was It A Dream?' and 'The Story' you're left captivated by the thousands of colors that the band has painted.  And just when you think the album is over, the extremely high-octane 'Battle of One' kicks into your stereo to rock you one last time.  Every single song on the record is so completely saturated with pure emotion, that you almost feel like you've found yourself standing in Jared's shoes in some sort of alternate reality.  This, my friends, is an example of a great lyricist and a spectacular performer. <br /> <br />While this CD may not be as experimental and atmospheric as their S/T debut, it is definately much more intense.  If you can get beyond the fact that their singer (Jared Leto) is also a famous actor, there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't add this CD to your collection.  It is easily one of the top 3 rock albums of 2005.
0312995423|1.0|This is potentially the worst book I have ever read. No matter how you look at it, it is hard to imagine how such pile of nonsense was put together.     At times the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and situations make you smile in wonder. (The book's only entertaining value).     One of the novel's action scenes is located in the cramped, deadly steep, badly kept staircase of Seville's Giralda. Needless to say, the best well-known fact about the Giralda is that it does not have an staircase (the moorish king that ordered its construction decided instead on ramps, allegedly so that he could ride his horse to the top). All in all, this is possibly one of the best researched and credible passages in the book.  At least he seems to know something about stairs, which is not the case for most other subjects he touches.    You can imagine the rest.
B0000A118M|5.0|Coltrane's greatest work and without-a-doubt one of the most influential jazz records ever made.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|My 16 year old daughter, 9 year old son, husband and I all LOVE the CD.  The music is catchy and we can't wait to see the play when it comes to our town.  I absolutely recommend this CD to anyone who loves Broadway musicals.
0316666343|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my daughter.  It isn't the typical book choice for me but I was extremely impressed.  I couldn't put the book down and have recommended it to many of my friends.  Interesting point from heaven and I liked that the murder wasn't the prime focus.
6305047529|4.0|When I saw this in 1947 or '48 I thought it was more hilarious than anything I'd ever seen before. I thought the same of Up in Arms, Knock on Wood, The Court Jester, and all Kaye vehicles. I must have been more innocent in those far-off days, and, sadly, it is now not quite as good as I then thought it; in fact, memory had enhanced the classic scenes and the dream sequences had got even better over time, so that when I saw them again they were faintly disappointing. Still, anyone viewing the film for the first time should find it hugely enjoyable; and it is famous enough for the Walter Mitty Syndrome to have entered the language. The Thurber story is a greater work of art, and it is unsurprising that he disliked the way his wistful and ironic little invention had become distorted. The most memorable parts of the film were those wonderful, heroic fantasies: \\"I'm taking her through: my arm is broken, but it's nothing\\"; \\"Ach, Himmel, it is Valter der Mitty: I'm done for\\"; Walter \\"Slim\\" Mitty (the Mitty Kid) \\"I wouldn't do that if I were you\\"; \\"Coreopsis has set in\\"; \\"Swallow 'em up, ole Mississippi --- mah regiment leaves at dawn\\";  but none of them quite matched up to the way I remembered them. Too bad --- it's still a classic, and I won't be garnering too many votes in agreement. Kaye was still some sort of genius, though.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this series because of the reviews and I was only sorry to see it end. Never watched the show when it aired but my husband and I consumed it on DVD. It ended all too quickly. The setting was engrossing, the music entrancing and the characters felt like family in only a couple of episodes. Can't wait for the \\"movie\\". Joss, I hope you read this.
B0001Z52S4|5.0|Time travel movies are usually hard to make sense of because the story writer often doesn't grasp the ramifications of their own twists of past events.  The \\"Back To The Future\\" trilogy plays with the concept, with strong characters, humor and juxtaposition.  \\"12 Monkeys\\" and the \\"Terminator\\" trilogy deal with end-of-the-world issues and the players who effect those events.  \\"Timecop\\" showcases Jean Clod very well, and takes us passionately into his feelings, as we see world events changed.  Other \\"lesser\\" attempts at the time-travel concept have been made into pretty good movies.<br /><br />The Butterfly Effect takes the allegedly simpler task of one small life and the small circle of friends who he may or may not have impacted.  Yet, the implications of one small change -- one butterfly-wing-sized change -- are shown to radically change the lives of that small circle of friends.  This movie masterfully chose to not try to make this story about world events or end-times events.  This choice actually intensifies the power-punch of the story, or should I say, \\"stories.\\"<br /><br />Some may see in this movie a statement that we are only a product of our circumstances.  My title for this review refers to The Three Stooges (ugh, sorry ladies) episodes in which two professors make a bet that those three guys cannot be made into gentlemen by their environment being altered.  (I'll let you guess whether they were changed.)  Nevertheless, this movie does not claim this.<br /><br />I find the statement of this movie to be two-fold.<br /><br />First, it is saying that if you knew what has gone on in someone's life, perhaps you would be more compassionate toward them.<br /><br />Second, if you had to choose between you being blessed and your friends/family being in ruin, or you being a handi-capped, gimped, overlooked has-been while your friends/family are blessed, which would you choose??  Gotta confess, this put me in tears.<br /><br />I won't spoil it by saying more about the plot.<br /><br />My only complaint of the movie was that the first few minutes of acting seemed wooden, as if the shrink and mother were reading their lines.  Not only did they get better, but the acting, casting and camera-work in this movie are top-drawer.  The script must have been challenging, and I'd love to give it 6 stars!  The writer even handled the challenge of; how do you play out (for the viewer) so many different life scenarios, without the movie being 5-6 hours long?  I'll let you see how they did it.  And it worked!<br /><br />As for the difference between the ending in the director's cut v. standard VHS, I think the director's cut is a sign of lack of bravery.  The viewer wants a solution, not a cop-out.  The video ending is stunning, emotive, and leaves me wanting Butterfly II!
0375713751|1.0|A well meaning friend gave me this book for Christmas.  She had never read the book but thought that is would be empowering to me and that Kate would become a great example.  She couldn't have been more wrong. If you love your work, your children and your husband this book will just depress you.  I understand what Kate is going through, I also have two children, I work, go to law school and my husband works as well.  I do all of this without the benefit of a nanny (unlike Kate) and without being so self absorbed that my husband is forced to leave me just to get my attention. This book seems to say \\"ladies, you can't handle it.  You can't have it all. Don't even try.\\"  The book will be loved by women like the smug stay at home moms that Kate encounters at her daughter's school.  As for those of us who love to work and who manage to make time for our kids (or who are still trying to figure out how to do it) this book is better left on the shelf.  Don't waste your precious time ladies, this book isn't worth it.      Read \\"Waiting for Birdy: A Year of Frantic Tedium, Neurotic Angst, and the Wild Magic of Growing a Family\\" by Catherine Newman, instead.
0375758992|5.0|One reviewer here gave this book one star because he thought the protagonist and her family racist. He is mostly right. None of that need detract from the fact that this is a superb book with a transparency and sense of place rarely seen. <br /> <br />you may not always agree with what you read in it but that does not make it any less worth reading. Speaking as a mixed race man who has lived in many places in Africa, I found this to be honest and well-observed. The fact that the author does not attempt to re-write her family history to appear politically correct speaks for her honesty. <br /> <br />Go read this magnificent book.
B00005JN5X|3.0|The Brothers Grimm promised to be a well of Gilliam inspired anarchy and creativity for fans of the film director. While it doesn't quie fulfill on that promise, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" is still entertaining Gilliam even if it doesn't compare to \\"Brazil\\" or \\"The Fisher King\\" (or even \\"Time Bandits\\"). There's enough of Gilliam's inspired lunacy in the film to make it worthwhile. I, for one, hope it's a financial hit just so Gilliam can get financing for his next feature film.<br /><br />The plot postulates that the Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) are con artists using folklore and superstition to make a living from ignorant peasants. When the Grimms are caught by the authorities they're given a choice; help the authorities unmask similar con artists who are kidnapping girls from a village or be executed. Needless to say, they decide to cooperate. What the Grimms find, though, is hardly a con men trying to bilk pheasants for their money.<br /><br />While the Ehren Kruger (\\"The Ring\\",\\"The Ring 2\\", Skeleton Key\\") script doesn't take the opportunity to develop the characters or the situations to their full potential and the film's editing feels choppy during the first hour of the film, there's still much to be appreciated and enjoyed in Gilliam's film. The film felt like it could also have been trimmed in the middle where the pacing lags a bit.<br /><br />As usual the production design is top notch and the feel of the countryside authentic right down to the crippled solider asking for money in the town square. The cinematography by Dario Marianelli compliments Gilliam's work even though this was a marriage of convenience. Although hardly perfect, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" is still a solid adventure for Gilliam's fans. Whatever flaws prevent the film from being perfect can easily be overlooked.<br /><br />Damon demonstrates a surprisingly nice comic touch as Will Grimm. Ledger plays Jacob as a shy academic type which doesn't always quite work (there were times I thought that Jacob might have nervous tics and some sort of neurological issues). Nevertheless, the two demonstrate nice onscreen chemistry. The rest of the cast from the Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce (in another of his performances as a military buearucrat reimiscent of the character he played in \\"Baron Munchausen\\" --which is ironic given his first Gilliam collaboration in \\"Brazil\\")to Peter Stormare in a gloriously over-the-top performance as Calvadi pull off their roles admirably. Lena Headey portrays Angelika as a steely, determined young woman who has emotionally walled herself off from the town she lives in and has no real use for the Grimm brothers until she realizes that they might actually be something more than charlatans.<br /><br />While this might not be the blockbuster that many were hoping for, it's an enjoyable ride. I found that while I was a bit disappointed in the overall effort, it's clear that Gilliam (as usual) put his heart and soul into the effort.s I thought that Jacob might have nervous tics and some sort of neurological issues).

B00004XPPK|5.0|Gilda is one of those movies which really helped define the film noir cycle of the 1940's-1950's.  Rita Hayworth is powerful as the femme fatale who is ruthless; and then, yet, sympathetic.  Glen Ford is the protagonist, but not the hero.  Great (and dark) acting.  Its in glorious black and white.  The viewer gets so involved in the acting and the story, one forgets it is not in color very quickly.  Themes to watch for:  the male figure is strong in regard to just about everything except when it comes to interacting with Gilda.  The femme fatale is tempting.  Watch Gilda and begin to understand what film noir is all about.<br /><br />  -- noir fan.

B000002J1L|5.0|As this is a replacement to an old album,no one had to sell me onto this CD. Although I have been a Genesis fan for many years , I do have a soft spot for the Peter Gabriel era. This was some of the most creative music to come from the band, and some of the best story telling ( yet slightly bizzare ) to be told. Anyone with a fondness for the \\"newer\\" Genesis, ought to enlighten themselves and take a step back to some of the classics!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. <br /> <br />My favorites are The Kill, The Fantasy, Savior, From Yesterday, and Battle of One. Actually, I just love them all. <br /> <br />It's very different from their first release, but all 30STM fans should still enjoy it. <br /> <br />Go out and buy it!!! <br /> <br />
B00004U9MS|1.0|They can play their instruments - about as inventively as 14 year olds, picking up a guitar for the first time. They do write their own songs - in that tired old vein of British pop, everything's the same. The singing is a joke - why do the sheep take that whole falsetto bull**** so seriously? If you buy this - you're over 20 and slowly your braincells are crumbling, soon you'll spend every Sunday shopping with your partner, drink half a bottle of wine a night, you'll tut at children with any hint of life, you'll begin to get indignant about manners, you'll find Terry Wogan funny ... and then you'll die, having only ever listened to mid-tempo soft rock.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Usually I'm on the cusp of what's going on in music; the guy people come to find out what's good. One band with a lot of buzz I missed out on so far is Death Cab for Cutie. I've had heard of the band before, but never took the time to check them out. Without listening, I pegged them a pretentious band with an unfortunate name. But with the release of their major label debut, I figured I should take a listen. <br /> <br />What I found on their latest album, Plans, were lush melodies and soft chords that wouldn't be out of place on the Garden State Soundtrack. Except Plans, as a whole, is more polished and better put together than most of Zach Braff's mixtape. You can easily get lost in the music without knowing where you're time has gone. The lead song, Marching Bands of Manhattan, takes the signature crushing guitars of Coldplay and softens them up with great results. A drum cadence drives Summer Skin almost into a march. Different Names for the Same Place starts off with a bare bones piano track that turns into spacey song half way threw. <br /> <br />I Will Wait for You in the Dark is a stripped down love song with an acoustic guitar accompanying the singer. With lyrics like \\"If heaven and hell decide, That they both are satisfied, Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs, If there's no one beside you, When your soul embarks, Then I'll follow you into the dark,\\" This song will send every hopeless romantic to their guitar to try to learn this song so they can serenade a loved on with it. What Sarah Said is a sad song that deals with the unbearable task of sitting in a hospital knowing this is it, \\"And I'm thinking of what Sarah said, but love is watching someone die.\\" <br /> <br />The main strength of the album is the verdant lyrics such as: \\"Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole\\" (Marching Bands of Manhattan), \\"I've no words to share with anyone. The boundaries of language are quietly cursed\\" (Different Names for the Same Place), \\"Fall fades how it ageswhen you're away, Spring blooms and you find the love that's true\\" (Your Heart Is an Empty Room), and what college girl not get swept off her feet by a line like \\"You're so cute when you're slurring your speech\\" (Crooked Teeth).
0743490304|5.0|After the success of the Da Vinci code and Angels and Demons, it is obvious that Dan Brown has found his place in American literature. The Deception Pointe has new heroes and story line, yet the suspense is non stop, and undeniably smart. It is hard to put this political thriller down.
0060512806|5.0|The scope of this book is something to behold. There's so much going on, you could easily re-read several times just to get it all. <br /> <br />Stephenson has a real gift for bringing different periods alive. His introductory chapter on pre-WW2 Shanghai is already strangely surreal and engaging; a US Marine unit is trying to make its way through the chaos of a typical Friday afternoon, with thousands of coolies marching and chanting from bank to bank to demand silver for currency. Stephenson weaves in an explanation of why this is necessary -- with the economic circumstances at the time, the world was starting to fall apart, and the chaotic scene was entirely necessary. <br /> <br />From this, Stephenson goes straight off on another tangent, about how every creature alive today is, by birthright, a stupendous badass. Just by having survived to this point in evolutionary time. Of course this is just an elaborate introduction to the Waterhouses, the family of one of the main characters. The tie-in is, \\"Now, as far as stupendous badasses go, these are some of the nicest you'll ever meet.\\" <br /> <br />The introductory chapters embody Stephenson's style for me: thoughtful, absurd, whimsical, enchanting. There are thousands of similar threads and tangents to entertain the reader along the way. It's all a question of: Do you want to get straight to the end, or do you enjoy taking your time along the way? I would call them detours, but they always tie back into the story in interesting and sometimes crazy ways. <br /> <br />The story is driven by cryptanalysis, both in WW2 and the present day. There are several plotlines going at any one time. There is the work being done by allied analysts to decrypt German and Japanese communications during WW2. There are the crazy adventures of Detachment 2702, tasked with giving the Germans false impressions that their codes haven't been broken, but rather the allies have guessed their plans in more conventional ways. There's Goto Dengo and the burying of the Japanses gold in the Philippines. And finally, the present-day high-tech start-up Epiphyte Corp. trying to set up a data haven in Southeast Asia; this haven is to provide digital anonymity for its clients and their dealings. Stephenson ties this anonymity in with broader social causes -- if the Jews had had a data haven of their own to protect themselves from an over-reaching government, could they have protected themselves against the Holocaust? <br /> <br />And finally, the characters are compelling. There's a scene near the end, where 2 of the main characters get to meet an important Japansese businessman to discuss joint ventures, and their reasons for building the data haven. This scene gives, for me, the emotional punchline of the book in a truly satisfying way. All the storylines, all the implications come together at once; it seems like the whole sprawling structure of the book is revealed with a single stroke. Great stuff. <br /> <br />A very satisfying read. One of my very favorite books.
B000819PKC|4.0|Being a fan for years, I was looking forward to getting my paws on this album. I went through a lot to finally get to it. Let's just say my loyalty forces me to say that it was worth it, but my little man won't allow me to.  <br />I think that this is a very average album, in comparison to what they have done in the past. Maybe I am a commercial junky, but the two albums that stood out for me has to be Traveling Without Moving and Funk Odyssey.  <br />But there are one or two tracks that will get that booty shaking and will feed the acid jazz/funk hunger. <br />It is not bad, but it is not the best. Maybe Jay Kay should tap into that hat collection to see if he will find inspiration for mind blowing sound. Feel free to listen to their first single Feels Just Like It Should and Electric Mistress. <br />So keep it up Jay and co, I believe that this is just a technical glitch
B0002F6BRE|4.0|When this movie was first advertised it looked like a pretty bad movie.Then i rented it .After i watched i went straight to the store and purchased it.This movie was hilarious.It had a good story and outstanding characters.I can watch this movie over and over and still laugh.This movie is a must have if you love christmas.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album was release in 1967 and it blew everyone away.  It was amazing for its time.  It still stands today as one of the best album compilations ever.  It was 6 years ahead of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon(DSOTM) which is probably the best rock album of all time.  The person that said this was a rip off of DSOTM is very confused.  His review should be removed since he does not know what he is talking about.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I bought this movie and i thought it was awsome.This movie is very suspensfull and had you at the edge of your seat from almost the start.The twist is awsome you would never expect it.They had a good choice of characters and it toke them only 18 days to shoot it.

B000002UAU|5.0|Wow, some people need to get their history straight. I mean seriously. Some reveiwer said this was a rip off of Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon............... do I even need to explain anything?  <br /> <br />Unless The Beatles traveled into the future with Doc Brown, who is a fictional character, I don't see how they could have copied Dark Side of the Moon. Pink Floyd didn't even become a band until a couple years after this album was even released. <br /> <br />Reveiw: Classic album and everything has already been said about the album that theres really nothing else to say.  <br /> <br />Best Moment: \\"A Day In the Life\\". A 10+ song! <br /> <br />Weak Moment: \\"Within You Without You\\", theres a better song like this on Beatles Past Masters Vol. 2 called \\"Inner Light\\". <br /> <br />PS. I like Pink Floyd too. <br /> <br />
B0000D96NW|4.0|I've been a Machine Head fan since I heard \\"Old\\" on T.V. I thought is was incredible, and honestly, \\"Burn My Eyes,\\" as a thrash album is truly legendary and certainly set a high standard for Machine Head right from the start. 3 years later they released, in my opinion, the equally as powerful \\"The More Things Change.\\" After that the next 2 albums got progressively weaker, and after \\"Supercharger,\\" it seemed that Machine Head were done for. Just when it seemed that the final curtain had fallen for this mighty band, they released 2004's \\"Through the Ashes of Empires,\\" which is not a complete return to form, but has successfully redeemed Machine Head's career...<br /><br />Opener \\"Imperium\\" kicks ass. No doubt about it. The guitars are quiet and sullen at the beginning, and then kick in with a bone-crunching riffs with some inspiring harmonics layered over them. The drums are clear, crisp, tight and pounding. Robert Flyyn's voice is aggressive as ever and the song absolutely destroys your ears. The refrain is beautiful and angst-ridden, just incredible. 10/10.<br /><br />\\"Bite the Bullet\\" has a really cool, heavy riff and is a pretty good song, but not one of the most memorable on the album. The vocals sound really good and the chorus is the main highlight of this song. 8/10<br /><br />\\"Left Unfinished,\\" is a killer song that talks about a very unique and personal issue (for Robert Flynn). Flynn was adopted at birth and his real name is actually \\"Matthew Conroy,\\" but his new parents gave him the name of Robert Flynn. The song starts with little chimes that are reminiscent of a musical box, and then the guitars kick in with the crushing riffs, followed by Flynn's acidic and hateful vocals. The chorus is fantastic and really brings the song to a climax. In many ways, \\"Imperium\\" is to \\"T.T.A.O.E\\" as \\"Davidian\\" is to \\"Burn My Eyes; and \\"Left Unfinished\\" is \\"T.T.A.O.E's\\" \\"Old.\\" That would be how I would describe these two songs, so hopefully that helps. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Elegy\\" is yet another phenomenal song and my personal favourite from the album. The beginning riff makes you feel like you're being tortured or stretched in spirit and has a kind of grungy feel. The Chorus is extremely scathing and the haunting backing vocals sound creepy and disturbing. The main riff is not really jarring but makes you feel like you're being chased or cornered by something. It just has that effect on me. It's a song that appeals to my personal struggles from the past, which is probably another reason I enjoy it the most. You get those songs right? Anyway, it's heavy, haunting, disturbing and sad. Sheer brilliance. 10/10.<br /><br />\\"In the Presence of My Enemies,\\" is another song that's good but doesn't really stand out in my memory. I enjoy the guitar work and the intro is haunting and builds tension, but the song just doesn't really stick out in my mind. You'll remember the main riff as it's simple yet effective and some of the vocals too, but it's not really a really fantastic song. I'd give it 7/10 I suppose.<br /><br />\\"Days Turn Blue to Gray\\" is an ok song, but not one of my personal favourites. The bass is light and a bit too high and the riff is good but the production detracts from the power of it. The verse and chorus are satisfactory but it probably won't be a song you really enjoy if you're a Machine Head fan. The thing is that this song is not really the distinct Machine Head style we're used to, so maybe this is Machine Head experimenting. They seem to be better at their heavier and edgier songs, but that's just my personal opinion. The song is redeemed at the end as it gets alot heavier and starts getting extremely aggressive, but a little bit too late in my opinion. 7/10<br /><br />\\"Vim\\" is a heavy, gritty song through and through. It's another fantasic Machine Head song with machine gun drums and pummeling guitars. Not to mention some very notable and scorching lead work. This song demonstrates what Machine Head can do when they justwant to kick ass and destroy. That's what's so wonderful and makes \\"Vim,\\" a really killer song. 9/10.<br /><br />\\"All Falls Down\\" is my lead guitarist's favourite song and I can understand why. The opening lead riff with the delay is really cool and the lead work overall is very innovative. The riff then kicks in and totally crushes and burns, just what every metal fan wants. The lead then kicks in again and the vocals work together to create a mesmerising and hypnotic effect with the refrain then snapping you out of your \\"trance.\\" A very cleverly structured song with some intelligent experimental work. 9/10<br /><br />\\"Wipe the Tears\\" is the last heavy song on the album. It opens with some vocals that build up tension and anxiety, finally being released with more crunching guitars. The refrain or bridge sounds really awesome as Flynn sings \\"Opportunity\\" with an echo effect and brings the song into a valley or quiet zone that relieves the pressure and anxiety. The guitars and vocals then build up again and then the whole wonderful catastrophe begins again. A really wonderful heavy song. 8.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Descend the Shades of Night,\\" is my least favourite song of the album. It's mainly acoustic work and just isn't condusive to Machine Head's style. The song never really gets heavy either. It's not dreadful but in my opinion is decidely average. If you like it, that's cool; but I'm just not convinced really. 6/10 for this song.<br /><br />Overall I'd give the album a cool 87%, which means it's pretty damn powerful. But the first two albums would be in the 90% zones if not 100%. Machine Head are on the road to a speedy recovery and this album is promising. Let's hope that Machine Head continue their course and focus more on the stuff they're great at: heavy stuff and innovation. Not acoustic ballads and soft songs. That's my take on \\"Through the Ashes of Empires,\\" so I think it's a worthy addition to your collection. Go ahead and buy it. I wouldn't have gone through each song if this album wasn't noteworthy, so buy it. You won't ever regret it! Peace out!when they just want to kick ass and destroy.

0195067142|5.0|Excellent description of battle conditions.  Should be required reading in schools.  A distant relative of mine flew Marine fighter support for these battles.  His version of the ferocity of these battles coincides with Mr. Sledges.  Glad we didn't have to invade Japan.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Moody and brooding with a bold soundtrack. These same characteristics are brilliantly reflected in Christian Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne.  This version is dark, dark, dark as expected to be.      Instructed in the Eastern Martial Arts by a strict mentor, played by Liam Neeson, Bruce Wayne learns to conquer his fear of darkness with zen-like mastery and uses his talents to fight crime and corruption in Gotham City. Over time, Bruce learns that fighting crime entails more than just defeating bad guys and taking revenge.  There is a more sinster and familiar threat that is wreaking havoc on Gotham.      Katie Holmes was brilliant as Bruce Wayne's long time yet not quite fulfilled love interest.  Both share a passion for fighting injustice, but is there time to lay aside duty for a moment to be with each other?      Overall, a very good film with a very real human element.  The best Batman version to date.
B000063UR1|5.0|I could tell you what the movie is about but it would be my own interpretation. If you see it, it may mean something totally different to you. What I can say is that, the set was very well done. Part of it was done on an actual aircraft carrier. With a few modifications, it gives the movie a very realiztic sence of taking place on a ship. Exteriors of the space ships may look familiar because although they are new and built for this movie, B-movies have recycled them and used them. <br /> <br />Personally, I think the movie doesn't go far enough. I think there was room for a greater plot without effecting the idea of the movie. If you're not into mjovies with political statements, you may not like this movie. But I think this movie has so many levels. Politics is only one interpretation. another is, \\"what would you do if you had to make a choice between society and what you believed..\\" The movie may seem long but it depends if it's your kind of movie. <br /> <br />This movie should be in your library if you are the kind of person who likes to think for themselves.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|WOW! This is another artist I thought I would never get into. But surprisingly I bought this CD, and it turnes out that I love it!!! It was also very interesting about how Avril's style and voice in her music have changed and matured from her first album. Here's what I thought of her songs:  <br /> 1.Take Me Away 3/5 - I didn't particularly like this one but I guess that it had some good parts. In the chorus, I think her lyrics were good, they all fit together.  <br />  2. Together 5/5 - I can definately understand why some people may not care for this song. Thats the way I felt when I 1st listenend to it. I thought it would just be another annoying song. But then it got addictive, and then I started to like it.  <br />   3. Don't Tell Me 4/5 - I think I heard this song along time ago. It's a great song that Avril made, but my favorite part would probably be the chorus. The verses weren't as good.   <br />   4. He Wasn't 5/5 - Now here's a good one!!! I think Avril made her voice deeper and differen't in this song, but it pays off nicely. When I listenend to the chorus, it didn't really sound like something Avril would make up. It sounded more like a fast POP chorus, and Avril really doesn't fit in there.  <br />    5. How Does it Feel? 3/5 - Slow song...so what could I say? It's good but not a favorite. My favortie Part : The verses.  <br />     6. My Happy Ending 4/5 - Just about everyone that listens to the radio has heard this song, so you can make up your mind about this one. I used to really like it but now it's sorta old.  <br />      7. Nobody's Home 5/5 - This is a GREAT song! DEFINATELY one of the best songs on the album. I don't get the lyrical part much but thats OK, because even without the lyrics and just the music, this song would still rock!  <br />       8. Forgotten  2/5 - OK...definately not a favororite. I'm thinking it's kinda a mean/dark song that Avril threw together for this album.  <br />       9. Who Knows? 5/5 - The beginning just screams:GOOD SONG! It has one of those good tunes, that sticks in your head because you like it. The Chorus? Well...It's good. Not great like the rest of the song. Just good.  <br />       10. Fall To Pieces 4/5 - Just like song 9, the verses are the best part of the song. Unlike song 9, in this song, the chorus fits better with the verses and the tune.  <br />       11. Freak Out 5/5 -  I'm guessing she's saying that I can freak out and I'm not gonna care what people are going to think about me after that. That's what's good about this song. Even though it's about Avril \\"freaking out\\" it still goes for others, too. Aside from that, great song! <br />        12. Slipped Away 5/5 - Sad song....but really good! This song is showing a WHOLE new side of Avril. I haven't  heard her write songs like this before. The Chorus, is probably the best part.  <br />              <br /> <br />Do you agree with me?
B000002J1Y|5.0|Folks, you cannot go wrong with this one. If you remember listening to these guys growing up, then buy this on right now. <br /> <br />'Nuff said. <br />
0440237688|5.0|I read this book in reading class at school a couple years ago. I remember thinking \\"Oh great, they're making us read another stupid book.\\" But as I started reading The Giver, I realized it was a really interesting story. I liked it a lot so I give it 5 stars!
B000AAF276|5.0|Though I may not have been born when during Clapton's heyday, I am definatley a huge fan.  This album, being his first album of new material in 4 years is definatley worth picking up.  Clapton covers everything from R+B tunes, to Reggae, to Classic Clapton Blues.  Definatley one for fans of the 90's Clapton, though the rest of us can still appreciate it.  It is Clapton after all!! <br />I'll see you all on his 2006 World Tour!!
B00006690G|5.0|I love this album! Every frekin song is great. I used to listen to this cd all day long when it was popular. Recently, I have added it to my collection of wonderful cds. Someday I'll dig it out and rap along with it and remember the old days.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I could go on for days about how I dislike this album.  If you are looking for anything remotely creative, interesting or perhaps different, then this isn't your CD.  I think SOAD needs to spend less time whining about politics and more time focusing on making quality music.   <br /> <br />What is the real joke here?  SOAD talks about unfairness, crooked politicans and people just out for money and power.  That is pretty funny considering they released an album clocking in at 38 minutes and they are going to release part 2 sometime in November.  They could have just made one solid album filled with songs, instead they decided to split the album in 2 essentially doubling their profits.  What a bunch of hypocrits.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I love this cd. I was so happy when I heard this cd because it's so original. All the songs are great and have nice beats and awesome lyrics. I like to put this on in the car and dance with my friends. The New Workout Plan is deffinately my favorite song. The skits are pretty funny too. This was deffinately worth my money.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|My best way to get across the idea of this album is to compare DCFC to Edgar Allan Poe.  Of all their songs my favorites are \\"champagne from a paper cup\\" and \\"Song For Kelly Huckaby\\".  Awww, that pounding beat is so chilling and seems repulsive but you want more and more.  Now imagine if Edgar Allan Poe's readers had to read love sonnets that he wrote because he was on some big publishing label.  Wait.. no, Poe wouldn't write sonnets because they appealed to more people than dark and malicious stories even if people paid him more money because he was mad.  However, Ben Gibbard is not mad, and it is not the production that makes his music sound different than the old stuff, it's his choice.  This album IS DCFC, BUT it's not any of their \\"acquired taste\\" stuff.  The goal here is to appeal to people quickly.<br /><br />I'm certain Poe could've written nice love poems if he wanted, because he was a very skilled writer.  Likewise, Ben Gibbard pulled off this \\"flowery\\" album quite well.  (BTW I'd never rate DCFC or Poe anything less than 5 stars)  Plus, I'm thinking this flowery stuff might grow on me.  .  Next I'll be reading Shakespeare... ;-)
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I hope this band is not out of material or destined to fail because the 2 most prolific members are betrothed.  I saw them live in Chicago this summer and they were very good and quite energetic.  They did exactly what I had hoped they would; made me want more.  The record is unique in its instrumentation and subject matter and the performance holds true to the content.  Buy the record and get tickets early the next time they come through.  There is a reason this band was hyped by independent record store owners.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|If 30 Seconds to Mars' self tited first album was the attack, their second album is the aftermath. When they released their first album it was a wave of fury of epicness in their music. It hit you like a meteor. But with their second album &quot;a beautiful lie&quot; they take a different approach. They exchange speed and distortion for more slow, mellow, and soft songs. No two albums of a band should sound the same, and 30 Seconds to Mars' new album does not sound anything like their first but still retains the qualities that fans liked about their first album. They've kept the deep lyrics, the epicness of their songs and although their new album might not sound as different as their first album did from everything else out there, their new one solidifies a reputation as a solid band. Awsome band, great cd, try it out!
1573225517|4.0|In times like these, it's hard to take pity on a cheating boyfriend who already pities himself. But as you read High Fidelity, you sense a connection with Rob's pain almost immediately. High Fidelity opens on a sad note: Rob's girlfriend, Laura is leaving him for another man. In an act of desperation, Rob makes a list of his top five worst break-ups and then tries to make amends with all the girls he's hurt over the years. In the process, Rob learns important lessons about life and who he wants to be; he also begins to realize that to achieve his dreams and aspirations, he needs Laura in his life.  <br />Nick Hornby delivers a riveting, albeit appropriate tale of relationships in the confusion that is life.  <br /> <br />A major detail of this book is Rob's tendency to make lists of his favorite things. As a record store owner, Rob tends to have fairly picky preferences. These lists reveal more about Rob's character than any other aspect in the book. Often featured in these lists are Rob's favorite bands, songs, and albums. The amazing music mentioned in this book--the Lemonheads, Jesus and the Mary Chain--make it all the more appealing, and I found that it was one of my favorite parts of this book. <br /> <br />Although some of the things Rob does to Laura in the process of winning her back are not the most conventional, it's still easy to relate to his character and what he's going through. Despite some minor upsets, Rob is able to realize what's really important in life and go after it. The emotional impact this book had on me is great. Nick Hornby managed to take fairly stereotypical characters and turn them into people everyone relates to. Through them, he reveals a true tale of life, love, and a record store. <br />
0440180295|4.0|\\"The cattle are lowing/ The Baby awakes/ But the little Lord Jesus/ No crying He makes.\\"  This is how the Jewish Kurt Vonnegut starts his satire Slaughter House Five by asking if Jesus cried when lives were obliterated with fire?  Thus, he hides an intricate attack against war within the story using simple language that allows readers to flow through the novel.  Throughout the plot, Vonnegut explores the horrible effects of war, brings new light to the plight of soldiers, and readjusts the focus of the reader's world view. <br /> <br />Slaughter House Five focuses on the horrific effects of war by describing the destruction wreaked upon Dresden in its infamous firebombing by the Allies, its destruction symbolizing the loss of a peaceful and important cultural center in Germany during World War II.  With this being the focus of the satire, Vonnegut is able to weave in numerous additional ideas concerning loss and suffering with Dresden as the symbol embodying it all.  But, with the focus of the reader on the mental wanderings of protagonist Billy Pilgrim, another horror is brought to light.  The shock put upon a person who has to undergo such a terrible ordeal. <br /> <br />The problems thrust on Billy Pilgrim by the trauma of the Dresden firebombing are quickly evident as the reader follows his schizophrenic mental journey through war, an alien zoo, and his life as an optometrist after the war.  During the scenes of war, Billy detachedly views his horrifying experiences with frighteningly calm amusement; the scenes in the alien zoo portrays the protagonist's ideal life; and the scenes of his abnormal behavior in life after the war all lead the reader to see the effects of post-traumatic stress syndrome created by the war; thus, creating more reasons to have peace. <br /> <br />Billy Pilgrim's wanderings through memory caused by the trauma of war bring a fresh new perspective of war and its consequences into focus like a new pair of lenses from an optometrist.  In many respects Vonnegut's use of humor to make a statement against war is very much like that of Larry Gelbart creator of M*A*S*H.  With elegant and simple language keeping readers focused on the issue, Slaughter House Five certainly makes a persuasive argument against war. <br />
B000002MY3|3.0|Alanis Morisette is right on.  She has a good voice and writes great songs.  But \\"You Ought to Know\\" was one of the most annoying, overplayed songs in recent history that really gave me a headache.  It prejudiced me from liking any of her following work.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|I have been listening to this special edition CD non-stop since it arrived from Amazon yesterday!  This is the quintessential Streisand classic.  Released in late 1980, the CD is written and produced by Barry Gibb and the result is nothing less than magical.  From the opening chords of the title track (a duet with Barry) to the closing powerhouse vocals and orchestrations on \\"Make It Like A Memory,\\" it is easy to see why this is Streisand's best selling album to date.<br /><br />A new listen reaffirms that these songs are true pop classics.  Well written, nicely structured, with the most amazing vocals.  As Barry says in the DVD interview, writing for Barbra is like writing for an instrument rather than another voice.  Her range is astounding.<br /><br />The classic singles are here (\\"Woman In Love,\\" \\"What Kind of Fool\\") but \\"Run Wild\\" is, in my opinion, the best track on the CD.  This song is classic Barry, a well written pop tune made all the more amazing by Barbra's performance.<br /><br />Barry's production is top notch.  Structurally, none of Streisand's other albums (none) come close.  (An aside:  Techincally this is not a \\"Bee Gees\\" production.  While Barry wrote some of the tracks with Robin and Maurice, it is Barry alone who produced and Barry alone who provided stellar background vocals.)<br /><br />Barbra and Barry make the ultimate team.  Their work here makes the ultimate CD.  I look forward to \\"Guilty Pleasure.\\"
B00000AFWW|1.0|This was Hole's last album, and we can hear why.  Courtney Love had cleaned up, but not for long.  Had they not been so lazy and taken a 4-5 year break after Live Through This maybe it would've been better received.  Instead of the angry screaches of the past or the melodious pop songs, this is restrained and sounds like they are trying to be far more mainstream.  It didn't happen, not by a longshot.    The songs in general are lite and airy, but the lyrics are bad.  I got the sense that they put this together without their hearts really in it.  And let's face it, it's all about the front cover where we are seeing Courtney's buff, toned, cut, beautiful body just before she went through extensive plastic surgery to pull her face taut.  This was Courtney's last effort to show the world that she had talent, but other people wrote these songs for her.  The truth is she has little to none aside from the ability to play a few chords, make a whole lot of noise, and be a bad girl.  There are all those rumors that Kurt wrote Live Through This, and I tend to believe them because that was WAY better than this lukewarm, white bread project.  I'm glad the other members of Hole bailed not long after this to move on, they needed to.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I purchased this DVD collection as a gift.  It was so easy to find and purchase with Amazon's \\"One Click\\" method.  I received the set within a couple of days.  It is the best way to shop!! <br />I love Amazon.com
B00002E224|5.0|I'm your average non-macho, atypical male! Romance has been a part of  my life since I first realized in 6th grade you can get a giddy feeling  in your tummy by looking at a cute female. That 6th grade romance was  on and off again until 8th grade and then I took the plunge for six  years with the same woman. Did we marry? No, but I've loved romance  ever since.    Both 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset' are two of my five favorite  movies of all time. I actually saw them in reverse order, as I'd never  heard of either of them and at the rental store, they only had the  latter. After seeing Before Sunset, I had to see Before Sunrise. Lo and  behold, they didn't even have Before Sunrise, so I went to Amazon and  proceeded to purchase them both. Since owning them, I've watched them  four times since!    Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy couldn't have been better cast by anyone  else. She and Hawke's youth (they were both 23 when filmed) and  innocence were perfect. The ability to take 90 or so minutes and  complete a whirlwind romance was a tremendous feat for Linklater. The  entire premise of the chance meeting on a train speeding towards  Vienna; the quick glances, the ability to watch like a voyeur the  evolution to the first words, lunch in the dining car; the persuasion  of Delpy to get off the train and spend 16hrs. walking through Vienna  with Hawke were spellbinding.    The chemistry of not only the characters, but what had to have been a  new professional friendship with Hawke and Delpy was very classy. The  companionship  seemed as real as any two characters I've ever seen in  my 51 years. Possibly Tracy and Hepburn comes to mind as the dialog,  the quips, and the laughter were all very genuine and non-contrived as  were many of the classic Hepbrun/Tracy pictures of old.    After watching it the first time, purchasing both DVD's and then  watching the sequel, I immediately took the following two evenings and  watched again. The second time, the true brilliance of the performances  became very apparent. I paid particular attention to the non-verbal  'acting' and it was so true to realism, I genuinely felt I was immersed  as a mouse in the corner watching the evolution of an actual love  story. If I would have read that Hawke and Delpy had become real life  lovers, I would have applauded their new found love and completely  understood. If I were playing opposite Ms. Delpy, I would surely have  fallen in love with her charm, wit, quiet sexiness, and the delicate  balance between a strong woman, yet one that desperately longed for a  man in her life.    Pay particular attention to the very subtle actions of their glances,  touches and how their acting really wasn't acting, but how their  scenarios would have played out in real life. The scene in the record  store was perfect as the two of them squeezed into a listening booth  and were listening to a jazz recording. It was a very awkward moment,  but the tension between them just dripped with reality! Should they  touch? Should they look at each other? I kept saying under my breath,  \\"kiss her you fool\\"!.    Another amazing part of this movie is the lack of nudity, raw sex and  just a few seconds of 'adult' language. The way Linklater closed the  film was so appropriate to their parting at the end. Taking slow shots  of the areas they had strolled through the night before and showing the  emptiness of it was very sad and made you even more aware of what  they'd developed in just a few short hours. Seeing the empty champagne  bottle and glasses in the grass at the park was so metaphorical it  brought tears to my eyes. The question, \\"Would they ever see each other  again?\\" was on my mind as was, \\"Would they give addresses, phone  numbers or would this be a fluke\\"?    I could write paragraphs about how this film played on my senses, but  if you and/or your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, or someone you  want a better relationship with see this, things will change for the  two of you. If they don't, it's time to move on to a different  relationship.    Make plans to at least rent this movie and its sequel, Before Sunset.  See them with your significant other. It can't help but bring you  closer, possibly patch up some differences, or realize it's time to  look deeper into your relationship. These movies  can show  that it's  ok to be vulnerable and open with the right person. These movies show  where a new friendship can quickly evolve into a romance with the right  person. Taking such a path can lead to a lifetime of mature and  enduring love, yet  even in absence, the heart does indeed grow fonder!    PS  A little over a week ago (March 9, 2007) I was fortunate enough to have had my own 'Before Sunrise'. On an overnight flight, a beautiful French woman (from Montreal) sat next to me and we conversed the entire flight! We spoke as new friends and I learned many different things about her that were exciting! Her history, her travels around the world, her education and current career as a small businesswoman.........this was really what it must have been like to the characters of 'Before Sunrise'. The smile on her face.......the soft French accent, wow! To top it off, spending another 2 hours with her and having breakfast were pure joy! We exchanged e-mails and phone numbers...........oh if only Montreal were closer................
014017821X|4.0|I am really happy to see other reviewers reveling in Ms. Carter's use of language, as I think her ability to turn a phrase is by far the strongest aspects of these stories. While my original reaction on rereading these stories after their laying fallow on my shelves for many years is that they are very much in the Gothic tradition of Edgar Alan Poe's stories, but I think that may be just a bit too strong. While, to my less than scholarly familiarity with Gothic short stories, I think Carter is able to conjure up the same dark sense of Poe's stories, I think Carter is just a bit less original than Poe. Carter, I am certain makes no apologies about the fact that she is giving us reworkings of old stories. Old wine in new bottles, as it were.<br /><br />The new bottle includes just a bit more tittilation than we get from the originals, and certainly much more lush and inventive language.<br /><br />As an old hand at reviewing cookbooks, I am especially fond of her many uses of culinary allusions, as when she speaks of her heroine's being peeled like an artichoke, down to the heart.<br /><br />The first reason I did not give this book five stars is because these are reworkings of old stories, and, as talented as her writing is, she is not Shakespeare. The second reason is that some of her endings are just a bit contrived. In the first, title story, our heroine escapes from her punishment for opening her Pandora's box by a pure 'deux ex machina', a rescue from out of the blue, with little preparation to make it more plausible.<br /><br />Still, this is darn good reading, and I am happy to know of Ms. Carter's work.
B0002858YS|1.0|Good God, does anyone know how these trolls got popular?  I try not to write negative reviews too often since I know music is subjective and all, but in the Killers' case I'll make an exception.  I think these guys have to be as good a candidate as any for 2005's award for the annoying pop/rock band that inexplicably achieves massive popularity with its debut album (maybe we can call it the Maroon 5 award).  Seriously, these guys are so unoriginal and forgettable they make Interpol sound like the Clash circa London Calling by comparison.  What's especially irritating about the Killers is that they specialize in the kind of sleek, overproduced songs that you know are incredibly stupid but get stuck in your head anyway, so I wind up with these ghastly tunes bouncing around my brain for days until I finally end up playing some Meshuggah and blasting them out.  Is there a stupider lyric in history than \\"Somebody told me that you had a boyrfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year.\\"  WHAT?  Is that supposed to be clever?  God, I don't even know anymore.  Anyway, I've had the misfortune of hearing this album in its entirety, and I can safely say that it's one of the 21st century's greatest atrocities thus far.  Beneficiaries of the herd mentality at its worst, the Killers thoroughly deserve the opprobrium of all music fans.
B000068IEU|1.0|OK - now that I have &#34;disturbing&#34; in the title, you might think that obligated me to affirm that there is something substantial enough in this movie to warrant some kind of off-handed praise. But, no. Why this movie is in the horror category at all is beyond me. It was really just a long, drawn-out, and sad look at the rape and kidnapping of two girls. Not my idea of a good premise for a movie. And yes, I did read the reviews here - and some fans who argue that it symbolizes some kind of middle American nightmare of loss of innocence in the 1970s or whatever - those kinds of films aren't lost on me. This one was just completely un-scary, non-interesting, and devoid of any kind of film viewing pleasure at all.<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...
B00019PDKC|5.0|In this album, Anathema combine all the best elements that characterize the band. No doubt, is the Anathema's album more melancholic and beautiful. I recommend it for all people. Word of a fan that know Anathema since old phase.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Once again, Opeth has done it.  The music is complex, conjuring dark, gloomy atmospheres.  The acoustic sections are priceless.  Mikael is a genius and I do not use that word lightly.  Mikael has the ability to growl, but has a real, honest to God melodic voice; not the stereotypical alarm-clock vocals.  Martin Lopez's drumming is still amazes me.  It's very tight and dominant.  Thank God he's no longer in Amon Amarth...  It's nice to see Per Wiberg in the band now.  He definately adds a new demension to Opeth's sound.<br />I was frightened that Opeth, now on a major label, would lose its musical integrity.  I hope Roadrunner/Universal realize they have a gem here and to concentrate on the music; not the &quot;almighty&quot; dollar.   <br />Opeth is a leader, not a follower.  Support metal and buy all their albums.  &quot;Morningrise&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot; rule!<br />Regards!
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is easily Pink Floyds most underrated album, as it was released between the much more popular Wish You Were Here and the overrated 1979 release, The Wall. Like all other Pink Floyd releases, Waters' lyrics are extraordinary. On this album, he borrows a concept from the late George Orwell (another genius in his own right) and his book Animal Farm, which deals with social class and politics. People are divided into three seperate groups: the greedy politicians are the Pigs, the motivated, yet lost businessmen are the Dogs, and the followers, or commonfolk, of the two are the Sheep. Quite the metaphor, eh? <br /> <br />Animals also showcases David Gilmours guitar playing at its technical peak. Yes, I know, his playing was never based around technical skill, but more of a finesse style of playing. Dogs contains 4 wonderful guitar solos, in which every note of Gilmours is perfect (heck, every single note he has ever played on the guitar has been perfect). <br /> <br />Animals is the most progressive of all Pink Floyd albums, and that is the only possible reason why it is not loved by a broader audience, like Pink Floyds other albums. It is also their darkest album; the lyrics and vocals being so haunting. <br /> <br />The three main songs on Animals are \\"Dogs\\", \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\", and \\"Sheep\\". The lyrics in Dogs are superb, among Waters' best, and among the best of any rock song. The lines - \\"And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake. A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile\\" - paint an image so vividly that you can see a close up of some businessman like in those cheesy 70's films. Four stunning guitar solos, and a long progressive break just add to this songs brilliance. Among Pink Floyds best. Next is \\"Pigs (Three Difference Ones)\\", truly Pink Floyds darkest song. It features some cunning vocals and lyrics from Waters, a long interlude featuring some Oinking (I can't figure out what instrumentthis is...maybe keyboards or guitar?), a nice bass performance (from Gilmour, I believe..wow he can do it all.) and one of Gilmours most technical solos to top it off. Sheep is another progressive suite, featuring a very nice keyboard intro via Wright, and nice riffing throughout from Gilmour.  <br /> <br />Overall it is a very good album from one of the most prolific artists of the 60's, 70's, and 80's. It takes a bit more listening to than other Floyd albums, but once you grasp onto its effect, the result is pure bliss.
B00001PE4D|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen along with one of the best soundtracks to go with it. Sara and Ryan are quite a pair on the screen, the chemistry between the two really set off the emotions the film was trying to enduce, and the music just added the feeling to it, especially with The Verve's song \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" at the end of the film. A must buy no matter what type of movies you like.
B000AADYYO|5.0|From 4:00-4:16 in \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" there's a sound that, with headphones on, sounds like your skull is cracking open in the back. It's very cool! <br />
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is very original, I learned a lot about this culture (I had never really heard much about it before). The story is touching, and very sad at times, but it is definitely uplifting. Keisha Castle-Hughes, who plays Paikea the main character, is such a great actress. I was very impressed by her, even though she is so young! I would recommend this movie to everyone I know.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Madden's _Shakespeare in Love_ was written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.  Stoppard wrote (and directed the film version of) _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_.  While that film appeals to a more intellectual or philosophical audiences (as it's based on a re-imagining of _Hamlet_, told from the perspective of two minor characters), this film plays the same \\"trick,\\" but appeals more to the romance evoked by its subject matter of _Romeo and Juliet_.      It would definitely help to be familiar with both Romeo and Juliet and Shakespeare's subsequent play, Twelfth Night, as the plot of _Shakespeare in Love_ weaves in and out of the characters and themes of those two plays.  It's less of an intersection with those plays and more of a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" of the writing of those two plays.  It cleverly takes Romeo and Juliet's focus on a love restricted by circumstance and puts it into the context of the Bard's own life.      The film does make one wonder about the historical veracity of the events depicted, yet the DVD extras don't seem to delve into that kind of investigation; perhaps our general lack of knowledge of the Bard's life is the real reason for these unanswered questions, but it would be nice to receive some sense of the \\"reality\\" of the events depicted in the film, without having to engage in a scholarly enterprise.  Regardless of \\"truth,\\" however, the film is wonderfully creative and intelligent.    Both in the theater and on DVD I felt this film lacked something, and one's love for Shakespeare does help during the times that the plot meanders about, but it doesn't affect it enough to make me drop it to four stars.  On the whole, this film is remarkably creative, intelligent, and romantic!
0028643151|1.0|This guy must be a democrat-since god knows when they've been screaming about global warming, WMD attacks and AIDS /Ebola epidemic.  <br />So far none of the above happened. If we're smart(and there is no liberals in the White House) it probably won't happen in the future. However, I have to debunk this guy's theories about the end of days. <br /> <br />1) Global warming-possible in theory. Doesn't mean it will happen. They've been screaming about it hysterically for the last 20 years\\" It will happen in a few years! Be warned!\\" Nothing so far.    <br />2) Plagues-once again-anything can happen but doesn't mean that it will. Mr Moran seems to think that AIDS is the biggest crisis the world is facing. Sorry to disappoint but AIDS have started with gays, drug users and prostitutes and its still there. You don't want to get AIDS- don't have unprotected sex and don't use drugs.  Then, there is Ebola, Lassa Fever and various other horrible diseases. The solution to not getting infected with one of these nasty bugs is simple-DON'T GO TO AFRICA. Those illnesses(and many others) originated there and fortunately, they haven't been exported.  Nothing there for any civilized person to do anyway. <br />3) Ice Age-refer to answer number 1 <br />4) Weapons of mass distruction-well, author's solution, I'm sure, would be -DON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS! Sarcasm aside, the only way to prevent some nut committing suicide with atomic bomb in his backpack is not to let him in the country in the first place. Of course,all we can do is to pray it won't happen. <br />5) Volcanic eruptions-they happen all the time and there is not much anyone can do about it. Best thing to do-don't live next to a volcano! Perhaps, poor saps living next to Mount Rainier should move-it really is a disaster waiting to happen. <br />6) Asteroid hitting Earth-a truly scary proposition but ...there is hope. According to media there is no way we can deflect or destroy an asteroid coming toward Earth. I, for one, find it hard to believe. Just like I find hard to believe that Star Wars doesn't exist. Lefties think just because there was no headline in the newspaper saying\\"Death Ray weapon built!\\" its not there. Personally, if I was the military I'd keep my mouth shut about it and shoot everyone who can't. I believe we have weapons and technology that public doesn't know about. Hopefully, that will solve an asteroid problem.  <br />The end conclusion-the only reasonable threat is from Asteroid. You can safely skip the rest of the book <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|I haven't listened to every album ever made (in case you were wondering), but of the many that I have heard, The White Album is the most eclectic.  There are other albums that have lots of variety (such as the works of Beck), but never has an album had such good songs in the context of variety.  In other words, The White Album doesn't go for variety just for variety's sake--they're great songs.  And for that reason, it has stood up marvelously against time.  To this day, the album sells well with college students, because they know that sometimes ya gotta have some Beatles to have a great collection of music. <br />What I also like is that for an album that came out in the middle of the \\"McCartney Era\\"(late '66 to the breakup in '70). John Lennon comes off quite well, better than on any album post-Rubber Soul.  In fact, of all the Beatles' albums, The White Album most democratically showpieces the talents of the two monsters of rock, John and Paul.  John's Julia is beyond beautiful; his Happiness is a Warm Gun is one of Paul's favorite songs; Glass Onion is brilliant, especially with the violin ending; Good Night, sung by Ringo to end the album, is one of Lennon's richest compositions. <br />Paul comes up with melodic masterpieces, such as Martha My Dear, which sounds like a classical minuet, the warm acoustical numbers I Will and Mother Nature's Son, and the metallic Helter Skelter, which McCartney wrote after reading about The Who having recently made the loudest, most raucous song ever--he wanted to top them.  Paul's bass is stellar, particularly on George's While My Guitar Gently Weeps.   <br />And speaking of great playing, The White Album is when George really came into his own as a lead guitarist.  George's chordal lead playing was always good, such as on things like Can't Buy Me Love, but as a note-by-note guitarist, he always lacked a certain feel and fluidity that other guitarists of the era were catching.  That all changed, and I believe that this was duelargely to his burgeoning friendship with Eric Clapton, who \\"wept\\" along on While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  From The White Album on, George Harrison was a different guitarist, and developed a unique style.  As a big fan of blues guitarists like Elmore Smith, I can say the Harrison became one of the best slide players ever--and that's saying a lot. <br />I don't know if The White Album is a great starting point to learn about The Beatles, maybe because it IS so vast, but it represents The Beatles as rock artists with varied interests more than does any other record.
B000002O1P|5.0|I'm a true blue Yankee but I love the sentiment of this work: the dichtomy of longing for your roots but being weary of them too.  These two themes are explored nicely in both \\"Rebels\\" and the title track.  Petty does a good job of expressing his love for his roots without giving us typical good ol' boy bombast or treacle.  In fact he is so effective that one could argue that his themes are universal and that the fact that he mentions the south at all is simply coincidental. <br /> <br />The title work is a great acheivement from Bentmont Tench's mornful piano to TP's heartful delivery of some great lyrics.  I must say that the imagery of the dream about his mother coming to him is very touching.  All of the song's are great here and contain some fine riffs, words and twists (like Tench's off key piano--recorded while he was unable to hear the mix through his head phones and just tinkered away as a joke--but later included because it's discordant result seemed to fit).  Two overlooked gems are also here (both in my Top Ten fave Petty tunes) \\"Dogs on the Run\\" and \\"The Best of Everything\\".  The former stands tall in the great tradition of metaphoric stories over a great rock chord progression and the latter a very sentimental look back with a fantastic opening line: \\"She probably works in a resturant, that's what her mama did\\".  How many of us have not pondered the lives of someone we lost track of?
B0009MAO46|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theatre in '95, I turned to my wife (yes, I'm still married to her!) and said, \\"Can I watch this movie every day for the rest of my life?\\" <br />The reason Toy Story works so well is that whereas lots of movies feature toys coming to life, usually it involves the tired theme of a Fairy Godmother tapping the toy on the noggin to make it animate.  With Toy Story, the toys only spring into action when people aren't around.  <br />The characters are great.  Tom Hanks (Woody) usually gets the accolades, but I believe Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear, or Light Beer, or Light Snack) steals the show.  Toy Story is one of those movies in which EVERYTHING works, and one which is equally enjoyable to kids and adults.
0743454537|5.0|In this thought provoking page-turner, family, friends, death, sickness, health, ethics, maturity, and love are all explored in great detail.  For some readers, that may seem like an overwhelming cornucopia of topics, but don't let it scare you off.  Jodi  Picoult does a fantastic job of balancing all of these elements.  In fact, the book is so spellbinding I already have six friends lined up to borrow it.  <br /> <br />I never dreamed I would be rivited by a story about a 13-year-old who is balacing life between a beloved leukemia-ridden sister and her own medically worn body and soul.  She fluctuates between desperatly wanting to keep her family together and wanting to make decisions about her own body. I found myself equally torn  as the story unfolds through the Picoult's clever use of six different story tellers. <br /> <br />Don't  be fooled:  this book isn't all about medical terminology and courtroom drama.  There are bits of comedy woven throughout that make it seem so realistic you will swear you're experiencing their lives right along with them.  Be prepared for the ultimate plot twist and keep a box of tissues nearby.

B0002XDODU|5.0|I've been a Rammstein's fan for a long time, and I have to say that they have never ever dissapointed with a new release, and as a matter of fact, they even seem to be getting better and better as they become older and older.  <br /> <br />\\"Reise, Reise\\" is probably the best album yet produced by these geniuses. It is filled with inspiration, clever thinking and significance. Every song is an amazing experience, showing that RAMMSTEIN has just become more and more stylish with time, refining in their taste for content in their albums.  <br /> <br />Highlights of the album, for me, include definetely \\"Dalai Lama\\", with its beautiful lyrics, very interesting song structure, and marvelous building up of the feel of the song. Another high point in Reise, Reise is \\"Keine Lust\\", dramatically well put in terms of the message, ends up in an emotional climax of coldness. \\"Moskau\\" is an amazing track as well. But the definite surprise with this album, for me, were the ballads. Us, Rammstein's fans, know that this band writes awesomes ballads, but the ones in Reise, Reise (Amour and Ohne Dich), are, in my opinion, the best ballads yet written by the band. <br /> <br />That's it. Amazing, glorious music from this clever German band. Perfect example of non convergent music that has achieved to master its own style.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|SAHARA is one of those films to view when escapism is the goal of the evening.  Made along the same lines as the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' genre, mixing adventure with comedy, a smattering of love interest, a dollop of social comment, and some pretty fine scenery that creates a stage for likeable actors such as  Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo, and Lambert Wilson, SAHARA succeeds in pulling off an interesting caper film.<br /><br />Not having read the apparently sacrosanct novel by Clive Cussler upon which the film is based, this 2 hour plus film seemed to putt along without any great shakes, without much in the way of character development, without any hint of screen chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey, but with the surprise pleasure of watching Steve Zahn steal the scenes with his comic talent. It is that kind of film - not to be taken seriously or valued higher than its intent.  It is just entertainment - and there is nothing wrong with that!  Grady Harp, August 05

0375760067|4.0|Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written.
0375751513|3.0|All art is quite useless.  Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century.  Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake:  he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty.  The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.<br /><br />This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality.  At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it.  Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young.  Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.<br /><br />Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach.  It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain.  Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art.  Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity:  \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\"  \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"<br /><br />I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy:  the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces.t insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy:  the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|As many people did, I found out about The Mars Volta on 2003 with the release of De-Loused in the comatorium and the whole story about Julio Venegas and Jeremy Michael Ward, I was glad to see the guys from At The Drive In truly going through an evolution with this new project, then I got all ATDI's albums, the 3 De facto's albums and TMV's Tremulant EP. <br /> <br />So when Frances the Mute came out I already knew a lot about The Mars Volta(unlike when i got the last album), I wasn't sure if they would come up with the same experimental extasis as in De-Loused, I thought they would come out with something more comercial, but when I got Frances the Mute, I was left blown away with the album, not only did they didn't came out more comercial(except for the widow) but they came out even more experimental.  <br /> <br />When I got the album i listened it everyday at least once a day for about 4 months, i just couldn't get enough of it, everytime I listened at it I discovered new stuff,that had only happened to me with one album in my life (de-Loused) and I thought it wouldn't happen again, but this album gave me a new reason to listen to music, a new point of view in life, a whole new life. Thanx TMV you made music interesting again!!.
B0009UC810|1.0|What a let down!  The promise of \\"never before seen footage\\" turns out to be the same \\"never before seen footage\\" from the last DVD.  The bonus materials on this disc are a joke (and not in a funny \\"ha ha\\" way).  The special \\"Introduction to the film by Dan Aykroyd\\" is 23 seconds long. The \\"Day on the Blues Brothers Tour\\" is nothing more than a lame performance by the current Blues Brothers at the House of Blues.  But the real insult is the featurette called \\"Remembering John: An ultimate portrait of John Belushi.\\"  It clocks in at 9 minutes long (including credits).  Ultimate??  This is John Belushi, not Garrett Morris!  <br /> <br />You might be reading this wondering, \\"So what was this guy expecting?\\"  Well, how about an audio commentary? Perhaps some outtakes?  Bloopers? Maybe concert footage of the REAL Blues Brothers on tour with Steve Martin?  Why not include Blues Brothers performance footage from SNL?  How about revisiting the locations made famous in the movie (the abandoned mall is still standing and still abandoned)?  Instead, they chose to include John performing as the Killer Bee on SNL.  Instead of a track listing booklet inside the case, they'd rather you have an ad for other \\"great\\" DVD titles available from Universal.  Instead of never before seen footage, you get the same documentary, the same production notes/pictures, and the same interviews that were included in the previous release.  <br /> <br />It's obvious that this was thrown together with little thought or effort.  The Chicago Sun Times did a better tribute piece to the anniversary of the Blues Brothers than Aykroyd did for his own film. <br /> <br />Oh well...only five more years until the 30th Anniversary Edition comes out.
078322737X|5.0|I originally watched this movie in high school.  Despite having been told about most of the best scenes in advance by my friends, it was still a lot of fun.  Of course, a lot of other people thought so too, as it spawned a nostalgia craze for the 50s and early 60s resulting in many (too many?) seasons of \\"Happy Days,\\" among others.<br /><br />A few years ago, I saw the movie again on TV.  I realized that, even though I was much more mature (at least physically), this movie still seemed very very good.<br /><br />I recently got the DVD and watched it properly and I have to say that, after careful scrutiny, this really is one of the finest films ever made.  I won't retell a story that's much better told by the movie, but: it has a lot of laughs, but it's not entirely a comedy (especially the ending); it has plenty of music, but it's not a musical; it has plenty of action, but no blood and gore; it seems incredibly realistic, but there is never a dull moment; there are multiple storylines and an ensemble cast, but it never gets confusing.<br /><br />Every aspect of this movie is impressive, but I'm particularly struck by the genius of George Lucas and associates when it comes to casting.  Every actor in this movie seems perfect for the role they play.  If you look hard you'll see quite a few familiar faces getting their start (including Suzanne Somers very briefly as the girl in the Thunderbird).  Many, particularly Harrison Ford & Richard Dreyfuss, went on to long, successful careers.  Although they were all great in this film, I thought that Candy Clark was a standout.<br /><br />If you get this collector's edition of the DVD you'll also be able to see an in-depth \\"extra\\" on the story behind the making of the film - very interesting.  It's inspiring to see that somebody as currently renowned as Lucas had to be incredibly patient and persistent (and put up with a lot of incredible Hollywood idiots) in his early days before his idea was finally realized.  His success in making this movie under such tough circumstances makes the end product even more impressive.  It's also very impressive to me that George Lucas went from writing/directing/creating a movie like \\"THX 1138\\" to this and then to \\"Star Wars\\" - all three very good and VERY different films.  I don't know of anyone else who has accomplished anything quite like that.<br /><br />Although I'm now quickly approaching middle age, I wasn't really old enough to be a part of the era depicted in the movie, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me.  The music isn't my music - I'm more of a post-British Invasion fan.  But the fact that a movie can make you relate deeply to characters from a realistic time and place you've never been says something significant.

B0006L16N8|1.0|Its mind boggling that Coldplay sells records, to me.  For a moment I'd like to compare the effect X&Y has on my mind as compared to the average 26 year old girl.      26 year old girl mind:  Coldplay comes on the radio.  The soft and pleasant piano sound fills her ipod headphones.  She loves Coldplay and like a retard imagines the cute singer howling his horribly overdone songs into his microphone.    Steve when a Coldplay single comes on the radio:      First thought:  Holy crap do I really have to listen to this damn song again.    Second thought: How is it that anyone thinks X&Y by Coldplay is anything special?    Third thought: Has anyone ever heard U2, Radiohead or Dave Mathews and knowingly bought a Coldplay record?    Fourth thought: I think Coldplay makes me very angry because X&Y totally sucks donkey balls.    Fifth thought: God that 26 year old is hot.  I think I'll bear this painfully simplistic Coldplay album and hit on her.
B00000AOUD|4.0|I really like Tull, but (evidently unlike many), I didn't see God while listening to this.  JT has made some really great albums and a few mediocre ones; this one's good, but not great.  It does have its moments/movements tho.  But, in its entirety, just a little bit too pretentious and drawn-out for my taste.  The good parts are very good, however.  If you find an \\"excerpt\\" of this album on a Tull collection, you've probably got 90% of the best material.  In fact, this is an album that was made to be excerpted.<br /><br />I'd suggest \\"Stand Up,\\" \\"Benefit,\\" \\"Minstrel in the Gallery,\\" \\"Aqualung\\" or one of the many Tull collections for anyone other than a hard core fan - in which case you'd have this anyway.
B000B5XOYI|3.0|It's certainly easy to slam WB, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher for their roles in the uneven film legacy being re-released here. With this summer's awesome \\"Batman Begins\\" providing a superior standard of measurement, these films seem to have gotten worse almost overnight. Most Bat-fans would probably rank these in descending order of release, with 1989's \\"Batman\\" the best of the bunch. The general opinion of \\"Batman and Robin\\" seems to get lower every year, yet there are many fans of the character that rank the macabre (and just plain weird) \\"Batman Returns\\" behind Schumacher's \\"Batman Forever.\\" In truth, all of the films have striking visual sequences, which are often betrayed by narrative missteps and botched characterizations. Even \\"Batman and Robin\\" (stripped of its gay subtext, awful dialogue and total disregard for the history and dignity of the Batman universe) features a well-developed portrayal of the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Alfred that strikes several proper notes. If you have held off on buying the no-frills DVDs that have been available for years, then this set is worth the money. In my case, I have the well-worn VHS copies ready for retirement - tracking issues are already apparent in all four tapes. For several years my very young children have enjoyed the neon colors and goofy set-pieces that dominate the Schumacher films, and I am looking forward to Tim Burton's commentary on the first two movies. I have my doubts as to how revealing those commentaries will be, but I am very interested in finding out. I also hope that there is proper attention given to the artistic design of the first two films, especially the work of the late, brilliant Anton Furst in \\"Batman.\\" A re-mastered digital soundtrack will also be a reminder of the evocative music, by both Danny Elfman and Elliott Goldenthal, that remains as perhaps the most accomplished aspect of the series.
B00003CXA6|4.0|You know what makes good film?  The thousands and thousands of actual Civil War re-enactors that participated in the filming of this epic.  These guys live, eat and breathe the Civil War and came from all over the country to assist in the making of this film and they are to be commended.  As for the paid actors, Berringer does a very good job, as does Daniels and Lang, in making this a believable and entertaining piece of film making.  Filmed on location in beautiful Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the film is mostly accurate with respect to the structure and positioning of the many men who were involved in the 3-days of carnage in 1863.  I know the townspeople in Gettysburg were very proud of the production as many had a hand in its making.   <br /> <br />There are no winners in this one...true of most factual historical accounts, but there were many brave, scared men who did what they had to do with what they had available to them. <br /> <br />Outstanding are Chamberlain's 20th Maine holding Little Round Top against insurmountable odds on day 2, and Pickett's Charge on the 3rd day of the battle resulting in the complete destruction of his division.  Both sequences are extremely riveting and moving. <br /> <br />Forget the 'politically correct' views of the characters as there is a lot of revisionist history in this one (consider the producer!), but it is a very good watch.  Definately NOT A CHICK FILM.  The film musical score is excellent. <br /> <br />So get past the bad beards and wigs and enjoy a soon to be classic film.  And if you can, go to Gettysburg yourself and try to get a feel for the events and appreciate what happened on that hallowed ground, July 1-3, 1863.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I miss FireFly!<br /><br />Star Trek was good but it always seemed to present such a one-sided view of the future.  The main characters didn't have flaws, they had blemishes.  They always rose above their blemishes to do the right things at the end of an hour.  Good and bad were pretty much black and white.<br /><br />Now FireFly showed a much more realistic possibility of the future.  The characters were more real, flaws and all.  There were so many indications of storylines to come that I was waiting each week for the new, the entertaining, and the sometimes silly.  What had happened to River and where was she heading?  The relationship between the Captain and the Companion?  The Shepherd that wasn't always a shepherd?  What did Wash do during the 'War'?  Bubbly Kaylee and the insecure Doctor?  They were an eclectic and an amazing group of people gathered for cross purposes, but became part of the family.<br /><br />My favorite moments was seeing the whole cast gathered around the mess table enjoying a great laugh.  But while the possibilities of potential stories was endless, the patience of a network to allow a new, and intricately creative, show find it's legs lasted only 11 shows.  It was a shame!  Fox gives something like Arrested Development two whole seasons to find an audience, but can't give FireFly 22 episodes.<br /><br />This DVD is great!  Being able to watch them in the order envisioned by their creative team was a blessing.  The extras add a little, but the real beauty is being able to watch each episode and the three never aired episodes.  It was well worth the price!  Share this with your friends who may have missed the short life of the series.<br /><br />Don't forget fan support convinced a lot of people to support a feature film of FireFly.  It's called \\"Serenity\\" ([...]) and it's being released on September 30, 2005.  Who knows maybe some network exec will see it and say \\"Why don't we turn that movie into a series?\\"
0802130208|5.0|There is something appealing about a misanthrope, and Ignatius in COD was that in spades. It is funny and a catharsis to read from a point of view of someone able to so completely abandon concern for the opinions of their fellow man. There were several old 19th century British novels that used a similar device, but none (that I've read) with so much success.<br /><br />I personally didn't find it side-splittingly funny, and the protagonist is naturally not someone you easily relate to, but as the story unfolds you can't help but realize how well written the book is, and how consistent it is, and just how brilliant it is. Knowing about the author's tragic story can almost overshadow the read at times, as it is impossible not to wonder how auto-biographical it was- but be that as it may, it has such a variety of well-developed characters and such good and unexpected plot devices, that the passive energy of the story overwhelms the sad undertone. Small wonder it makes it to so many English teacher's summer reading lists.
B0007TKNII|5.0|.....Andrew Lloyd Webber and Charles Hart for their gift to us of Beauty, Love and Tormenting Sadness, and to Joel Schumacher, his cast and crew for this inspired and everlasting movie.  It is the most perfectly and beautifully produced musical in the history of film.  Nothing the naysayers write or say can change that.    Nay-nayers of the 'first-Broadway-performance' persuasion must realize we cannot revisit the past or obtain visual recordings of the original performances.  That would be so unncessary anyway, since this movie's cast consists of the most beautifully able performers of THIS time, and their legacy to us and future generations is the tremendous heart they have put into this towering achievement.    This is NOT supposed to be a vehicle for grand opera performers or great ballet dancers. SHAME ON THOSE WHO TEAR IT DOWN.
0375703861|4.0|First off, I've read this book 2X and have enjoyed it both times, however, on  the 2nd time through, I couldn't shake the fact that the only white family in the book are overly-intellectual, bigoted, sappy, smarmy love-themselvers. And thoroughly unrealistic. The novel ,which up to the introduction of the Chalfens was rich and realistic and very, very funny, took a downward turn that it barely recovered from due to the ridiculousness of the Chalfen-clan. I am obviously recommending this book, and Zadie Smith IS an extraordinary writer, but I feel that in order to demonstrate one of the book's main purposes of alienation and the search/struggle for a personal and national identity, she unnecessarily, perhaps inadvertantly, streamlined middle-class whites into a forged stereotype. Which is a shame, as the rest of the novel is quite textured and even at times intimate.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Uninspired musical production (\\"I'm So Stupid,\\" \\"Mother and Father\\"). Laughable lyrical content (\\"American Life,\\" \\"Die Another Day\\"). The baroque use of electronica and voice synthesizing do little to showcase Madonna's commentary on the American Dream (or American life, as the title suggests). Overall, this album is a missed opportunity. We know, as listeners, that a middle-aged woman as shrewd and business-oriented as Madonna would have better things to say.
068987474X|4.0|I have found Greg's book to be very helpful.  I am still not dating but at least now I know what to look out for in the kind of man I want and want to spend the rest of my life with. <br /> <br />I don't agree with everything Greg wrote but it's just a book, not a 'How to manual' to deal with men. Good to know that men are really simple creatures. So, now that I know the secrets, where are the men? <br /> <br />Thank you,  <br />Julie
B000006045|4.0|Whether you are listening to the entrancing \\"Angel\\" build to a blaring crescendo, or the Middle-Eastern influenced \\"Inertia Creeps\\" reach a sensual climax, listeners are not likely to be disappointed by Massive Attack's album Mezzanine.  The other tracks, such as \\"Dissolved Girl\\" and \\"Exchange, Part 2,\\" prove just as seductive and moody--blending unique vocals with perfect delivery.  It is an album ideal both for spontaneous, romantic settings and introspective, lonely nights.  The only misstep in the album, however, is the awkward lyrics in songs like \\"Risingson,\\" (the rhyming scheme in this particular song is terrible) which would have failed had it not been for the ingenious musical production.
B00005JN5X|2.0|When I went to see \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" last weekend I was expecting a great film because Terry Gilliam,(The Monty Python Series) directed the movie. I was very very wrong. Indeed The Brothers Grimm had cool special effects and it was fairly funny, but that was not the problem. This movie did not have a good story, it had poor acting, and very dumb humor.<br /><br />The major problem I had with this movie was it was like a puzzle, Gilliam took bits and peices out of other movies, storys, and fairy tales that didnt fit but he still put those scenes in there anyway. Which in the end, the final product looked horrible.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|With the band moving onward and upward, the second release from 30 Seconds To Mars \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is showing an apprpriate change in their music.  With a phenomonal fan-base known as the ECHELON created from the first albulm, this one is sure to create new fans and retain those that have been along for the ride from the begining.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|Have you ever stopped to admire a landfill? Sure, most people think landfills are nothing but large piles of assorted garbage, but they're all just aesthetic simpletons, unequipped with the intellectual capacity to appreciate the brilliant post-postmodern complexities offered by the chaotic amalgamation of the discarded and forgotten by-products of a hyper-capitalist lifestyle. When one looks beyond the mere surface of the landfill, one discovers an entirely new and exciting paradigm of artistic expression, laden with unseen intricacies and rife with social commentary. The landfill, long thought to be simply a heap of offensive waste, is actually an avant-garde means of artistic expression. Everyone else just doesn't \\"get it.\\" <br /> <br />If you, dear reader, are at this very moment nodding in agreement with the above paragraph, the joke is on you. In much the same fashion you've just convinced yourself to appreciate landfills, I assume you could convince yourself to enjoy The Mars Volta. Like landfills, Mars Volta songs are bloated, elephantine entities (the longest, \\"Cassandra Geminni,\\" clocks in at 32 minutes) comprised of an astonishingly diverse array of fundaments mashed together with no readily apparent structure or organizational schema holding everything together. Also, much like landfills, Mars Volta songs stink. <br /> <br />Certainly, the members of The Mars Volta are not bereft of ideas; however, principal songwriters Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala (ex-At the Drive-In) are far too busy picking their afros and practicing their disaffected poses for press photos to be bothered arranging said ideas into compositions containing any semblance of cohesion. Case in point: opening suite \\"Cygnus ... Vismund Cygnus\\" veers from dense rock song to disinterested guitar wankery to a staggeringly bloated (Trans-Siberian) orchestral segment before finally collapsing under its own weight and repeating some cut-and-paste dub rhythm ad infinitum over the course of its 13-odd minutes. It's eclectic, yes, but also immensely boring. Give me \\"Naked City\\" any day. <br /> <br />Herein lies my largest complaint with the Mars Volta: they mistake length for depth. The group is simply far too caught up in impressing themselves by writing a 32-minute song that they tragically overextend and subsequently massacre what would be relatively interesting ideas. All said, \\"Frances the Mute\\" is a tiring 77-minute marathon of a listen, and my inability to share the band members' smug infatuation with their own supposed virtuosity and lyrical prowess makes the album almost comical in its decadence. Hipsters everywhere will trip over themselves trying to prove they \\"get\\" The Mars Volta, but they'll simply be ogling a landfill.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Ok, maybe you've seen too many Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson movies by now, but this has to be one of the funniest of them all. It beats Starsky and Hutch! The parody of the fashion industry in general, picking on all of the cliches and stereotypes on models, together with a tremendous comic versatility by Ben Stiller is brilliant. The slow-witted model Derek Zoolander finds himself brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia but then... And I won't spoil it for you. The cast includes Ben's dad, Jerry Stiller, which you'll probably recognize from the \\"King of Queens\\" show, Ben's wife, who plays the Time magazine reporter, Owen Wilson as the rookie model and the inevitable and oh-so-funny Will Ferrel in a very funny portrayal of a fashion designer. And Milla Jovovich as Katinka Ingabogovinanana (it's hillarious to hear Will Ferrel introduce her to Ben Stiller). And then you have all sorts of celebrities that you'd find in fashion shows and the like. If you want some laughs at the expense of the fashion industry (which, in itself, is comical) then get this movie!
0861714911|5.0|Thank you to Bhikku Bodhi for his tremendous effort.  If you are a serious practitioner, especially a lone practitioner as I am, this book is invaluable for making available the undiluted teachings of the Buddha himself.  Most of the books in my Buddhist library have been helpful to some extent or other but most are explanations of the teachings, i.e. the Buddha's words once-removed.  I rank very highly What the Buddha Taught, by Walpola Rahula.  This book is much more extensive.  It is also more accessible than The Middle Length Discourses (trans. Bhiddhu Nanamoli and Bhiddhu Bodhi) because it is organized into general topics, such as \\"The Human Condition\\" and \\"Mastering the Mind.\\" Highly recommended as a life reference.
B000003TA4|5.0|Don't ask me! Nirvana is one of the greatest bands that ever set foot on what we Earthlings call a \\"Stage\\". Kurt Cobain was so frickin' awesome, even though he hated his stardom.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|Transatlantic was the hot chic that all the guys stare at. Plans is the girl you talk to at the party for a while and go \\"wow... she is friggin' cool\\". Although i think Transatlantic had a more solid opening track, this record offers its first great song on track two, but thats me. I've taken this record with me on the public bus and had a few listens and admit at first i was like \\"eh.. its good but not great\\". The record is slower than Transatlantic. So the mood is an adjustment. Then after a few listens... i found myself having more affection for certain tracks. I can't say i like it more than Transatlantic but i think DCFC fans may like this more. I'm a fairly new fan and i suggest people with shorter attention spans try Transatlantic. For those who can appreciate the more moody and subtle styles of this band, you'll want to check this out. There are a couple up tempo songs but not enough to call it a rock record. But I'm glad my attention span is getting longer...  i almost missed out.
B00000IQW3|4.0|This is a great family space adventure about a young man who has nothing to look forward to in his future, except going to City College and living in a trailer park forever. Alex Rogan's only joy is his girlfriend Maggie and the 'Starfighter' arcade game at the trailer park general store. After he breaks the record on the game, a mysterious visitor from the stars shows up at the trailer park to bring Alex to Starfighter Command. Alex soon leanrs that everything that was depicted in the game was real. There is a Starfighter contingent and the enemy portrayed in the game is real. When a sneak attack destroys part of the the base and all the current Starfighters, Alex reluctantly decides to help. He and his navigator are the only things standing in the way of a full on invasion of Starfighter Command and the planet they protect. This was the first film to use CG instead of models for all the spaceship sequences. It looks great, especially in the DVD remastering. This is one of the films that is a classic and will always remain one.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Well, to paraphrase the review of Plans from Jane, DCFC has been making the same album over and over again. Well, frankly, I see it as a good thing. They've kept their standards high with their distinctive genre-bending style and their quality vocals. The lyrics manage to be emotionally powerful without coming across as sappy or overdone.  Yes, Plans is similiar to DCFC's other albums, but it has its own character that makes it possibly the best one yet.
B0000844I8|4.0|The movie that helped launch the popular long running television show 'Stargate SG-1,' the film version stars Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neill and James Spader as the dorky but brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. The Egyptian mythology is brought to the forefront of the story when a mysterious large ring is found on a dig in Egypt in 1928. The US Air Force, trying to discover what the device is, enlists the help of Jackson, a foremost expert on Egyptian mythology. Once he discovers how to turn the Stargate on, a strike team is dispatched to the other side of the gate to make a threat assessment. From there the film takes off with action, drama, and mild comedic moments. Jaye Davidson ('The Crying Game') does a great job as the false god Ra.
B000001DWG|5.0|I purchased this album on a whim while shopping at my local CD store and i can honestly say without hyperbole, it was the best $10.74 i will ever spend in my life. Andy Wood was a man who had a gift to share with the world, but forces beyond our control always seem to take the great ones when theres still music left to write. Secondly, get over these \\"grunge\\" comparisons, Love Bone sounds nothing like any of the bands of the time, not to put down the early 90's at all, which i believe was the musical high point in american rock n' roll. Support all bands from Seattle but please, enough with the \\"grunge\\" comparisons, grunge isn't even a real musical genre, its merely a blanket term for all the bands coming out of Seattle, even though none of them sound nothing alike
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is the best film of 2005 (with the exception maybe of 'Star Wars Episode III'). Rodriguez, Miller, and Tarantino do a fantastic job of bringing a visual masterpiece to film. The movie behaves as though you're watching the graphic novel (which I think was the point). Bruce Willis leads an all-star cast as a cop with a bum ticker and ready to retire. Mickey Rourke does the best job in the film as the vicious animal Marv, who is out to avenge the death of a hooker he barely knows. The film is split into four main stories. The first is the story of a man (Josh Hartnett) who courts young women, then kills them.  The second is Hartigan's story (Willis), where he is after a kidnapper and murder of young girls. Then we have Marv's story, which deals with a creepy and sadistic Elijah Wood. The final story is 'A Dame to Kill For,' where Dwight (Clive Owen) must try to stop a creep (Benicio Del Toro) from hurting the local group of hookers with his gang. This one is the third best story. The Marv story is the best, then Hartigan's then Dwight's, then the Man's story (which is the shortest). They pretty much all interact with each other as well, even though they are each stand alone stories. There is lots and lots and lots of violence, and plenty of nudity (especially on the part of Carla Gugino, \\"Spy Kids\\"). Definitely get this one!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|When I think about pure entertainment I'm not necessarily thinking about a traditional comedy.  Rather, I think about a feeling I get when I'm sitting there and watching outrageous actions on the screen and I'm constantly giggling.  Such is the delight of Kung Fu Hustle, a brainchild of Stephen Chow from Hong Kong who wrote, directed and stars in this rather outrageous spoof of martial arts movie.  He's also captured the spirit of American cartoon characters, the ones that get hit on the head with a hammer and come up smiling, or whose legs turn into a roadrunner in order to flee disaster.  This is the stuff that this 2004 film is made of - a rare piece of clever entertainment.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of poor but hardworking people who live in Pigsty Alley.  However there just happen to be three accomplished martial artists in their midst.  One is a tailor.  One is a hen-pecked husband.  And one is a matronly woman in a shapeless housedress and curlers who always has a cigarette dangling from her mouth.  Into this neighborhood comes our star, Stephen Chow and his chubby sidekick.  They pretend they belong to the Axe Gang so that they can shakedown the people for a little money.  They're stopped cold in their tracks though.  And soon there is more than only the three unlikely martial artists of Pig Sty Alley they have to contend with.  There's the real Axe gang itself.<br /><br />The action never stops and the story plays out with outrageous martial arts scenes enhanced by the use of modern technology, concealed wires, and special effects.<br /><br />On the negative side, the film did drag a bit though, especially near the end when the jokes had already worn thin.  But I think just a few more feet on the cutting room floor would be all it needs.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a rare treat.  I definitely recommend it.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|If you've seen the musical stage production, then you already know the story. If you haven't, then the film is basically the same thing, scene for scene. The only thing that the film does better than the stage production is the advantage of different sets and locations, whereas the stage is limited to...well...the stage. The music is good, though I think the Phantom casting was a little iffy. Gerard Buter (\\"Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life\\") plays the Phantom and it seems in some areas that he's straining to get to the right notes in the songs. It's especially noticeable in 'Music of the Night,' which is basically the biggest solo song for the Phantom. Emmy Rossum does a great job as Christine and doesn't miss a beat in the music. All the songs are good and the sets, costumes and story is solid. The extra features on the DVD are nice and make this edition a well-rounded representation of the film.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars continues to amaze me.  This band is not just a band that got signed because of a famous lead singer.  This band has talent.  Jared Leto seemed capable of writing some pretty rocking, decent songs on 30 Seconds debut album, and on this CD he definitely follows through.  Tracks such as \\"From Yesterday,\\" \\"Attack,\\" and \\"The Kill\\" are excellent rock songs.  Jared has the perfect \\"frontman\\" voice for this band.  The slower, less \\"rocking\\" songs on this album are excellent as well.  I am way more impressed with this CD than I thought I would be.  I needed an injection of something rocking and something worth listening to.  This album is what I was looking for.  The band's musicianship, as well as Jared's song writing have definitely matured over the last couple of years, and they sound phenomenal.  They sound tighter and more comfortable with their sound.  Like they aren't just trying to be popular because of their frontman, but like they're trying to be popular because they actually deserve it.  And they do.  30 Seconds to Mars is a unique sound in rock music today.  I would say that along with Coheed and Cambria, 30 Seconds to Mars is the best \\"new\\" rock band out there since the turning of the millennium.  This is a great CD.
0345409671|2.0|This is a bad follow up to the previous novel 'The of the Body Thief.'  'Devil' has Lestat basically seeing ghosts and follows the Devil through Heaven and Hell in order to decide if he's going to be the right hand of the Devil in Hell.  This book is incredibly slow and deals way too much with religion and things that don't really pertain to anything. The cutaway chapters with David Talbot and Armand are actually the best parts of the book. If you liked the other Vampire books, then I recommend skipping this one, though stuff does happen that will affect the next book, so you may want to mutter through it anyway.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I am a massive rap fan, but I am not easily pleased when it comes to albums. Unfortunately, many rap albums are beset with the plague known as 'filler', meaning tracks that are lacklustre. A 5 star rap album for me is a rare thing - there are probably around ten rap albums to which I would personally give this top rating. This rating means that the album is FLAWLESS.    Doggystyle is an album to which I unhesitatingly give this accolade.    Although there are several short skits on this album, they could not be described as filler because they do not attempt to add to the album musically - they are simply interludes.  To say each song is a masterpiece is not an overstatement - in terms of G-funk rap, you cannot fault them. The track which I least like on the album is 'Doggy Dogg World', but that is because I used to have it on a hip-hop compilation tape I made and I have heard it too much. But I know that it is an excellent track.    This album is unrelentingly hard, and this is perhaps one criticism people would level at it. I personally love it. However, people could, and do, call the subject matter of the album (drugs, gang activity, violence, sex etc.) irresponsible and offensive, glorifying of negativity etc. However, to judge this album using moral criteria is ridiculous. Snoop couldn't have cared less about that sort of thing when he made the album - he was simply speaking his mind and reflecting, to a large extent, on the conditions of his upbringing in Long Beach. To judge Snoop Dogg and gangsta rap negatively because of their immorality is like judging the width of a football field using a screwdriver. It just doesn't work. It is simple, straight forward music which doesn't care about ordinary boundaries and which openly sets out to shock and surprise you. Just appreciate the music.     To quote 2pac, Snoop 'was given this world, he didn't make it', so when he talks about issues such as gang violence, perhaps people who are quick to crucify him should perhaps first reflect on why this is a part of his upbringing as ordinary to him for open discussion as parental problems etc. are for the middle class.     It is funny to look at the lowest rated reviews of this album, because most are just false. For example, I hear that this is rap for mainstream pop fans. I own over 2 hundred rap albums, and most of them you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere near the charts. Yet I love this album. Hmmm.  Also, apparently only white middle class youth can appreciate this album. How can someone even say that? It is evidently not true. Snoop has wide respect wherever you go.  Snoop Dogg is not the paragon of morality. He is disrespectful towards women through his use of the b word. This is one criticism that has to be taken on the chin. But it does not take away from the musical quality of his music, and that is a simple truth. Just the moral quality. Snoop's upbringing, as is the case with many young men growing up in inner city, poor areas, with no father figure to speak of and only local gang-members etc. to look up to has engendered an extraordinary level of sexism in him. It is something of a practical inevitability because of the social and economic inequality in society that he would be so.  Nonetheless, I am reviewing this album for its musical quality, and this is undeniable. My Doggystyle album is 12 years old, and it has withstood the test of time miraculously well.  A truly great album.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Usually, a great band that you love, has one cd that seems to be superior to all others. Which seems to be a rare thing in music the last few years. What is even more rare is that the smashing pumpkins did that.....twice, back to back. Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are two of the greatest rock album's not only of the 90's but of my generation. Listening to this album to me, is pure bliss. Billy Corgan is not only a great singer/ lyricist but a grea guitar player too ( along with James of course.) I can only hope that The Smashing Pumpkins do reunite like Billy has planned. Maybe they can save the music scene a bit. The Smashing Pumpkins are one of a kind, with the music to prove it.<br /><br />Cherub Rock - 4.5/5 Famous for Jimmy's drum intro. Not all that is good here though. The guitar playing is tight and the perfect start to one of the best rock album's.<br /><br />Quiet - 6/5 Don't let the title fool you, this song is anything but quiet. One of the best on here, great intro riff. Followed by some great take no prisoners drumming.<br /><br />Today - 5/5 One of the most well known song's on here. For good reason too. The simple melodic guitar intro is great. \\"Today is the greatest day i've ever known......\\"<br /><br />Hummer - 5/5 Definetly one of the more \\"epic\\" type songs here. Clocking in at nearly 7 minutes. Billy Corgan has some beautiful singing here.<br /><br />Rocket - 4/5 Has some of the best guitar playing on here. Song really starts to kick in about a minute into the song.<br /><br />Disarm - 10/5 Wow, one of the best. The acoustic guitar and keyboards give it such emotional atmosphere. Some of the most touching lyrics Billy Corgan has ever written. In my opinion of course.<br /><br />Soma - 4.5/5 Following up an incredible song like \\"Disarm\\" is no easy task but Soma is able to hold its own. It begins slow but slowly picks up, great piano too.<br /><br />Geek u.s.a - 4.5/5 Begins with some funky drumming then the distorted guitars show up and becomes a great rock song.<br /><br />Mayonaise - 6/5 Starts out with some depressed guitar work. Between the guitar work and Billy's vocals this song is tough to beat.<br /><br />Spaceboy - 15/5 Picking a favorite song on an album as good as this one, is no easy task. Spaceboy though, could definetly be that song. One of the most heartfelt smashing pumpkins song ever. The acoustic guitar is incredible and the chorus is just haunting. \\"Spaceboy, I missed you!\\"<br /><br />Silverf*ck - 4/5 Drum's and bass really shine here. More tight musicianship here.<br /><br />Sweet Sweet - 3.5/5 a short dramatic song that begins with some impressive electric guitar.<br /><br />Luna - 5/5 Perfect closing song. The lyric's are quite good and reflective. What I always loved, is how heartfelt the lyric's feel when Billy Corgan sings them.<br /><br />So, to end this. Should you buy this? In my opinion, yes. It is an album where every insturment shines and no filler. Everything fits. Enjoyg then the distorted guitars show up and becomes a great rock song. <br /> <br /> <br />Mayonaise - 6/5 Starts out with some depressed guitar work.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|If you've never heard of 30 Seconds To Mars know this,you will now! They have surpassed themselves in creating music that touches people in so many different ways,lyrically,musically and emotionally. <br />The new CD *A Beautiful Lie* is different from their debut CD in that it was created from the heart,soul and minds of another place and time in the bands' life. Many of the songs are easy to relate to and you can interpret the lyrics as you see fit,but they still reach out and touch you in some way,shape or form. <br />Jared's voice has grown stronger and more melodic,so much so that it grabs your attention immediately! Matt,Tomo and Shannon also have honed their talents,showing tremendous strength and passion in their playing.  <br />30 Seconds To Mars continues to amaze me with their energetic and magnetic abilities on this CD.
0061015725|3.0|I think Michael Crichton got a lot of things right in \\"Prey\\". A good set up, an action timeline that pushes forward, characters that fit the story, interesting science, good research, and (though we can't say for sure) it likely had a great outline. But the plot is simply too thin to support a full length novel. The efforts at foreshadowing reveal too many points too soon, yet without them the reader would lose interest.  <br /> <br />As a result, the strange occurances are no mystery to the savvy reader, and at times your subconscience tries to shout to the man character -- \\"Wake up will you! Anyone could see what's going on\\". Think of a crowded theater showing a B-movie horror flick with an eager audience shouting out advice to the hapless characters,  and  you'll gain an glimpse of your inner dialog while reading \\"Prey\\".  <br /> <br />Re-edit this book as a long short story or novella and you've got a tight thriller that delivers well. The parts are there, but developed far more slowly than the short story this work cries out to be. <br /> <br /> As as full length novel, it falls somewhat short of the mark left by Crichton's best work. It's not a bad read, but it's not truly satisfying. Who knows...maybe this novel was the one originally meant to be a film treatment (instead of Timeline).
B00008YJH5|4.0|That's both good and bad. If I had to choose one word to describe \\"Surfer Rosa,\\" it would be 'baffling.' The majority of these songs are pop songs as tightly constructed as those of the Beatles, though with lyrics Paul McCartney would never dream of writing (\\"He bought me a soda and tried to molest me in the parking lot\\" comes to mind), and wailing noise more in common with the work of Lennon's wife. <br /> <br />That said, this is an occasionally superb record, with \\"Bone Machine,\\" \\"Gigantic,\\" and \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" all anticipating every guitar-based act to hit it big in the next decade. If you can stomach the album's disturbing hit-and-miss 2nd half, buy this right away.
B0000A1RJI|1.0|Most likely the worst soundtrack since \\"Don't go in the Woods\\", this CD is not even worth of being called an actual score, for it is but a sampler. The credited composer, Klaus Badelt, is one of the many sour apples on that termite-ridden branch known as Hans Zimmer's \\"Media Ventures\\" - yet even by the nonstandards set by that output, the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" pseudoscore is downright wretched. Consisting almost totally of extracts from previous Media Venture soundtracks, patched up with generic electronic noise that appears to have been \\"composed\\" by a Casio synthesizer set to emit a random note every 15 milliseconds, this plodding, dull, flat evokes all the feeling and excitement of attending Hrantr's concert while having a cold (Note for the simplistic illiterates, i.e. 99% of the ones that ranked this CD at five stars - this is a reference to Lem; learn to read, drop your comic books and try picking him up instead). <br /> <br />Since in the past some of the xerocopiers from Media Ventures did manage to compose a few worthy themes, they all have been included in this sampler. Hence, on this CD that allegedly contains a \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" score, you will find everything from \\"The Rock's\\" Hummel's Theme to Badelt's own cues from \\"The Pledge\\". And while, as I said, some of the themes are fine on their own, they make a terrible mish-mash when combined - one that might possibly appeal only to the dullards who only associate the word \\"score\\" with \\"the points I got in Half Life II\\", and who define a soundtrack as one of those repulsive \\"inspired by the movie\\" nu-metal/rap garbage collections released on CD in, sadly, higher quantities than real music. <br /> <br />Some might wonder, \\"What is the matter? 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a thoroughly bad film, aimed at dull children of low attention span and an even lower intellect - surely such a mediocre movie deserves a mediocre score!\\". One needs to know only the basics of score history, however, to noticehow often bad films spawned magnificent scores - and this could have been no exception. In fact, it *should* have been no exception, as Alan Silvestri himself was supposed to score \\"Pirates...\\" - and, unfortunately, was replaced by the Badelt automaton. <br /> <br />In fact, the previous Hollywood foray into high sea piracy, Renny Harlin's \\"Cuthroat Island\\", was a bad film in itself, yet it gave the world John Debney's score, which not only outranked even the enchanted pirate classics of Korngold, but which quite possibly is the best score of the last decade. And since any random second of Debney's \\"Cuthroat Island\\" is worth more than everything the Media Vulture Badelts will ever produce, stop giving thought to purchasing this sampler of their messy \\"music\\" and instead get Debney's treasure chest - recently reissued in a complete 2 CD version - immediately.
B000000W6F|5.0|'Gish' kind of gets overlooked because of the insanely huge album that would follow it, but this is every bit as good as 'Siamese Dream.' It's mainly heavy rock, although in more of a psychedelic vein than anything else the Pumpkins have out. \\"I am One,\\" \\"Siva,\\" and \\"Tristessa\\" are delicious Pumpkins heavy-rock, though they're more jam-oriented than later outings. \\"Rhinoceros\\" is a lethargically paced ballad that explodes into insane guitar soloing at the end. \\"Window Paine\\" splits the difference between the two, beginning as the slowest song on 'Gish' and ending with 30 seconds of feedback noise. \\"Suffer\\" makes the Gothic heart of the Pumpkins just a bit clearer, with haunting guitars and a mysterious flute solo. \\"Crush\\" and \\"Daydream\\" are the album's two acoustic numbers, though done very differently. Despite the endless shrieking lead breaks, this is a very laid-back set, more candles-and-incense than anything. This is nowhere near the wall of sound that burst onto MTV two years later with \\"Cherub Rock.\\" If you're OK with that, buy this right off.
B00005JODA|5.0|Intelligent and moving political thriller that should be held right up there with \\"All The Presidents Men\\" and \\"The Killing Fields \\" as one of the best political thrillers ever made. Fernando Meirelles tops his last directional effort with a thriller that is moving, scary and down right forthright in it's views of big companies gone wrong and the horrors that they are willing to inflect on others for the sake of profit. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give career best performances in this film and that's a huge compliment considering the fact that they are good in almost everything they do, even in bad movies. Weisz is strong willed and obsessive and Fiennes is determine and endearing and both of them compliment each other with their destine to be award winning chemistry and acting chops. The director compliments both of them with a view of Africa that is rarely seen in film and a sense of reality that is only found in real life.       Rachel Weisz, Ralph Fiennes and Fernando Meirelles all should be honored at award season for their amazing efforts in this film because as of right now, this is with out a doubt the film to beat come Oscar time.
B00008YJH5|5.0|'Surfer Rosa' matched up the Pixies, on their first long player, with Steve Albini (later to produce Nirvana's 'In Utero') and he brought a sound that was as precise as a razor whilst somehow permitting completely uninhibitted performances. This album is, for my money, the Pixies' finest hour. At the time, this sound was basically unheard of, apart from the more delerious musings of Sonic Youth. But listening to Surfer Rosa is like watching someone load up a pistol and then fire it through you. It's an album you can feel, not just hear. The cranking, defiant 'Bone Machine' kicks off the album, probably one of the most confident opening tracks of any band on their debut album. Black Francis screams out 'You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me!' and you know you're in for something different. All of the songs are great to explore over many times. The art school atmosphere of this record makes the lyrics fascinating cryptic exercises that you can listen over many times and find new angles. My favourite tracks are Cactus (very scaled down and hauntingly sexy), Break my body (which sounds like a jet taking off and is over in less than two minutes) and River Euphrates which features the most intense screaming to ever grace a recording. It took me many listens to work my way into this album and I'm still learning about it with each play. David Lovering's drums are beautifully recorded - every beat sounds like a body blow and this solid, gutsy foundation allows Kim Deal, Joey Santiago and Black Francis a lot of freedom to have fun with their playing knowing that they can land any solo they fly with onto Lovering's almost shockingly solid backbeat. 'Where is my Mind?' is the crowning achievement of the album known to many, but make no mistake, this speaks best as an entire album, and it came to be one of the most influential on the nineties (still two years away when this was made). Often imitated, but never bettered...
0786852550|5.0|This is fantasy the way it should be written, on two planes: one is the story and the other is the adult-engaging sarcasm and humor. This book is a great pleasure to read out loud to your (older) elementary school child, or to read to yourself just for the sheer fun and escapism.<br /><br />There has been, no surprise, a spate of wizarding fantasy, but this book finds a new approach, a new world, and has virtually nothing whatsoever to do with the Harry Potter-inspired approach to wizards.  In this world, England is divided into Wizards (who run the government and have demons who do their bidding) and commoners (muggles), but the commoners are quite aware of (and perhaps a bit resentful of) the magicians. The magicians themselves spend quite a bit of time scheming to increase their power, and the demons spend most of their time angry about their enslavement in service to the magicians petty needs.<br /><br />In the middle of this comes a young, highly talented, perhaps ambitious apprentice with a conscience who uncovers a dastardly plot.  Things do not proceed in a predictable way, and the book is full of unexpected twists and not a few insights into how people with power actually do behave.<br /><br />This first book in the trilogy has a bit of violence, and younger children will miss some of the humor (maybe most of it) but they will be engaged by the characters and they will be enthralled by the story.  I'd be cautious with children under 9, but if they've read HP, they'll be fine here.<br /><br />We are very much looking forward to reading book 2 and can't wait for the release of book 3.
B000002MP2|5.0|In my opinion, this album although released ten years ago, is still brilliant and could very comfortably sit in the rock charts today. So the album must have been not only great then, but is still current today. <br />Most tracks are fast and lively, like amercian idiot, their most recent similar release. The lyrics are genius, electric guitar riffs exceptional and pace of the songs will have you emotionally drained. <br />All tracks deserve to be played loud, so turn it up. <br />My favourites are \\"Having a blast\\", Basket Case\\", \\"she\\", Sassafras roots\\", When I come Around\\" and  \\"Coming clean\\". <br />The songs are all classic Green Day and anyone who bought \\"Amercian Idiot\\" will definately like this album, I promise. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|When I look at what happened between 50 and the Game I wonder how much better this album could have been. 50 claimed to have helped Game on 6 of his tracks and can be heard on 3 including Hate it Or Love it my favorite from the Documentary. All the songs that 50 says he helped out on are some of my favorites and would have made this one near 5 mic status. Out of 21 tracks on this album I find a VERY solid 8 tracks worth listening to and that's without Piggy Bank Disco Inferno and Candy Shop. And God Gave me Style is one of my favorites to just sit back and relax to. I took that song and burned it on a mix CD and was playing it in front of a friend who really hates 50. He liked that song so much that he went out and bought the album. If he had kept the Game songs on this album I think over half these posts wouldn't be here.
B000000OA6|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  Great music often comes from the extremes - either from the depths of sorrow or the heights of joy.  Even though Freddie Mercury knew he in-fact was dying when this album was being recorded, I have to say that the he and his band mates collected enough joy in the spirit of their love for being together, recording together, and playing together to out weigh the depressing situation that they must have been in.<br />The best part of the album, for me, comes in the final song...&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; during an interlude where Freddie sings &quot;My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies...fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die...&quot;  So true!  This is a fantastic album, I highly recommend it.
B000AADYYO|5.0|The new masterpiece \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is just a continuation of the absolute brilliance of Opeth.  Fans will agree-----Opeth NEVER disappoints.  I have all cd's including the dvd and am so impressed with the talent of these guys.  Opeth is truly underrated in some aspects due to some people not fully grasping the songs(length).  How many bands can write and play a 10-minute plus song and make it sound good------only OPETH and Dream Theater in my opinion.  Which is why I brag on them so much.  Do not hesitate for a second----buy this and ALL Opeth cd's or your cd collection will be truly lacking!!!!!!!
B0006L16N8|3.0|Personally, I was a teeny-weeny bit dissapointed in this album. Maybe I may have expected too much really, but it didnt sound like much of an improvement on \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\"....But having said that, I DID love \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" so I didnt chuck my X&Y CD out altogether. As a matter of fact, I loved most of their lyrics; they really make you do some deep thinking. The beginning track \\"Square one\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" are my personal favourites. Overall its a not-too-bad album...I would definitely recommend it ESPECIALLY if you don't already have the previous one...
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|this CD is amazing!  <br />I love the fact that all the members are in on this one! they all have so much to contribute and in this album they get to make it all their own not just jared! <br />BUY this album it is so beautiful!
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Once I heard \\"From Yesterday\\" I was hooked. Is every song \\"great\\"?...no, but anytime I can listen to a CD over and over again without it getting old, I know I spent my money well. Compared to the first album, some fans might shy away, because it has a little more corporate feel to it, but if you can make money and still contain a fanbase (new or old), then you have succeeded, and I'm still a fan after listening.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|SCARFACE is Brian DePalma's and Al Pacino's operatic masterful retelling of Howard Hughes', Howard Hawks' and Paul Muni's definitive 1932 gangster film of the same name. First panned upon its 1983 release, like it's predecessor and namesake SCARFACE has become a part of the American cultural consciousness far beyond itself.<br /><br />Pacino plays Marielito Tony Montana, a small-time stickup artist in Castro's Cuba who becomes a major drug kingpin in 1980s Miami. Pacino's Montana is reminiscent both of Muni's character and of his own portrayal of Michael Corleone. In Montana, Pacino shows us the twisted inner workings of the criminal personality he presented so convincingly as THE GODFATHER.<br /><br />Pacino gives us an intentionally over-the-top performance, using a theatrically \\"theek\\" Cuban accent and unremitting obscenities (estimated as one every thirty eight seconds on average) as the foundation stones for Tony Montana. Much of Pacino's characterization depends on black comedy (Tony's beloved bright yellow Cadillac with the tiger stripe interior is ridiculous to the point of screaming laughter, as is his bloodthirsty earnest buffoonery---after killing two men in cold blood he casually offers his third intended victim a job: \\"Okay! You call me tomorrow!\\") Pacino's humor hits its high point when he mutters miserably, \\"I don't trust Mob guys,\\" while lighting a Corona in unconscious flattery of Vito Corleone. Scarface is very intentionally the id of the more calculating Don Michael.<br /><br />DePalma, through scriptwriter Oliver Stone, manages to penetrate to the heart of darkness of the cocaine subculture. Surrounded by metric tons of cocaine, warehouses full of money, and all the trash it can buy, Montana values only three people in the world, his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and his friends Angel and Manolo (Steven Bauer), one of whom he kills himself and two of whom die through his indirect machinations.<br /><br />When Angel dies in a gruesome chainsaw scene as brilliantly conceived and executed as Janet Leigh's shower scene in PSYCHO, a classic of directorial misdirection, Tony's humanity all but dies, and he rampages through Miami's drug underworld, butchering his rival, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), stealing Lopez's vicious, sexy llello-emaciated wife, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), and burying himself alive in a lust of grotesque materialism. For just a moment the world is his.<br /><br />Pacino captures Montana's colorful rise and his robotic downfall perfectly, showing us that Tony Montana is a spiritually dead character.  Although he fights to protect Gina and idolizes her throughout the film, his lifestyle of excess eventually claims her, as unable to grasp the thought of love as opposed to sheer possession, Tony kills Manolo when he discovers them together. (The two had secretly married and planned to surprise Tony).<br /><br />DePalma also uses the tropical motifs of Miami in a subtle way to mark Tony Montana's rise and fall. Starting out as a wisecracking second-story man addicted to Hawaiian shirts and jeans he later graduates to neon technopop polyester leisure suits in pastel colors and then finally to dark black pinstripes. The further he descends into evil the more conservative and less bright he appears.<br /><br />Pacino's Montana ends his depraved existence with his face buried in a mound of cocaine, and firing a grenade rifle at men come to kill him for botching an assassination---ironically, Tony is to die for not killing the children of an important politician. In the end, this flicker of compassion can't redeem him.<br /><br />The Special Edition second disc has some fascinating material comparing and contrasting the two SCARFACEs, and exploring much of the underpinning of this gangster classic. One of the more interesting segments is a hip-hop exploration of the film, which has become a kind of bible for 'gangsta' rappers. To see Tony Montana lauded as \\"a man of principle,\\" \\"loyal to his friends\\" and a man who \\"has it all\\" is an incredible expose of the mindset of the rap contributors to the segment, since Tony Montana is none of the above, except in the most meaningless of ways.<br /><br />Although SCARFACE has its uneven moments and Tony's rise is far more fascinating than his inevitable fall, this movie is far better than its initial weak press reviews indicated. SCARFACE is a true classic and time-capsule piece of the Miami drug scene. Once again, Al Pacino is being, not acting onscreen, and the results are nothing short of amazing.xpose of the mindset of the rap contributors to the segment, since Tony Montana is none of the above, except in the most meaningless of ways.

B000A7S4B0|4.0|This album is not the departure that some listeners are alluding to. Granted, it's not as produced or noisy as their other records, but 'Howl' is pure BRMC. More than anything, this album echos previous material like \\"And I'm Aching\\" and \\"Shade of Blue\\" from \\"Take Them On,\\" as well as \\"Too Real\\" from \\"BRMC\\", and the outstanding B-Sides \\"At My Door\\" and \\"Down Here.\\"  Their musical ingenuity and craftmanship really shine through, and being a long-time BRMC fan, the style of this album didn't surprise me much at all. It will take several more spins to really get the gist of its depth, but in the beginning this record excels as a very fresh rock alternative.
B0009UC810|1.0|1 star for a 10 star movie?! You bet.      I love this film more than you know, but I have really, really had it with this PC BS. I paid $40 not long ago for a copy of the out-of-print extended cut edition only to find that it was actually CUT and poorly edited (I mean it, you can still see John's lips mouth the 'word') to eliminate the F word in the line, \\"Well thank you pal, the day I get outta prison my own brother picks me up in a f***ing police car\\". Yes, I know it's crass and disrespectful - but tell me that is not one of the funniest lines in this movie!      When I saw the 25th Anniversary edition with the so-called 'Theatrical Cut', I was overjoyed. I would have paid twice the retail price for the actual movie with aforementioned line intact. Imagine my shock and crushed hopes only to find that, yet again, this line had been edited.  It is disgusting beyond the filthy word itself to edit this from the THEATRICAL version. Yes, that's right - you were lied to with false advertising - it is NOT the original 'theatrical version'. In the theater, in the 80's, it was different.    UPDATE 8/31/05 - Get this Amazon people - I went to check for the errors that other posters had mentioned like the Bob's Country Bunker scene and found, to my relief, that the scene played fine on my player. BUT!! I decided to watch the rest of the movie and found that I too had errors! I have compiled a list of the errors I have found so far. Check these on your player if you decide to buy this inexcusably poor quality release.    Side A ERROR LIST:  At 1:42:49 the movie skips to 1:43:30 and does indeed eliminate the 41 seconds of footage in between.  At 1:44:05 it skips to 1:44:15 then to 1:44:17 and finally starts up again at 1:46:13.    At this point this almost feels like some sort of cruel hoax on the people who hold this movie dear. Unbelievable. Universal is evil.
1567184855|5.0|A life is transient--we're born, we live, we die--but the soul goes on, born into a new body, gathering experiences lifetime after lifetime. These accumulated life experiences influence the current, active lifetime on a subconscious level,and some traumatic experiences leave troubling footprints on one's current life. Dr.Newton (Ph.D.)shows through case histories of patients who have been \\"regressed\\" (scientific and verifiable), that a contemporary stumbling block can resolved by identifying the trauma that created it. For example, a mystifying pain in this lifetime can be a \\"soul memory\\" of an injury in a past life; or a current pathological fear of water is from a \\"soul memory\\" of drowning in a past life. Then there are the souls who are so deeply connected that they have share many lifetimes as siblings, and close friends, and spouses. What was most fascinating to me was the \\"memory\\" of what happens between lives, when we return to our \\"soul groups,\\" review our lives, see what lessons we have learned and which ones we have to try again. In short, life is school for the soul. Is there matriculation? Yes, in a sense there is in that we learn and move on. Are there trips to the principals office? Oh yes. Souls who do terrible things in a lifetime go through what we might call \\"deep reprogramming.\\" But the best part of all is that we come from and return to a system of self- and mutual respect and love.There is randomness to life, yes, but we are neither puppets nor chips lost on a raging river. Some people experience recognition while reading this book. One woman said, \\"I knew that! I knew that!\\" and felt empowered to take control of her life and stop drifting. It's a life-changing book.
0060594888|5.0|As a self-help seeker, I was hooked at age ten when my father gave me my first book called the \\"Power of Positive Thinking\\" by Norman Vincent Peale\\" and I discovered it worked. Since then I have read an extensive collection of empowerment books, some that have been better than others. This book is great! Jack Canfield and Janet Switzer have taken the Success Principles and added just enough simplicity and inspiration that you feel as if they are with you every step of the way as you work toward the life you've always dreamed of. Every time I implement something from their book my life takes another path toward my cherished dreams. Jack's principle of Ask, Ask, Ask until you find someone who will say yes and his success story of how he and his co-author Mark Victor Hanson went to Book Expo to sell Chicken Soup for the Soul inspired me to do the same with success. As a result, I went from an everyday women to achieving a dream of being a national author of a lighthearted and humorous wellness book called Diary of A Modern Day Goddess. ([...]) If it happened to me it can happen to you by applying the success principles.
B0002BO0HG|5.0|\\"I didn't know what had been missing from my life 'til i heard Antony & The Johnsons\\". Both this album and 'I am a bird now' are beautiful and tragic records. This is a very moving album without ever getting depressing. I can hear alot of Bryan Ferry (circa Avalon) and Marc Almond in it. It's easy to picture it being sung by Antony under a bright white spotlight, center stage, in a smokey underground bar in Berlin in the 30's. Roses being thrown, tears being cried, all to rapturous applause...
B000AADYYO|5.0|What a breath of fresh air.  The metal scene right now, while better than it has been in years, still lacks something.  Most bands are total ripoffs of the Gothenburg heavy metal scene.  Outside that, there are few acts doing something unique.  I have never hesitated to say that Opeth is that band.  Every album is new, yet still classic Opeth.  Ghost Reveries pushes the envelope one step further.  It is easily their best since Blackwater Park.  The songwriting has been kicked up since Deliverance/Damnation.  The songs are notably more progressive and the mellow parts and mellow tunes are a bit more interesting than much of the work on Damnation.  This is an essential album for any metal fan.
B0008ISM40|3.0|Solid NIN album.  Nowhere near the greatness of Pretty Hate Machine, but still good music.  I think Trent's return to the \\"scene\\" is well produced.  The sound is top notch and the vocals seem almost to be stronger than usual for Trent.  However, the emotion of the album does seem to be a bit on the \\"mainstream\\" side almost as if he was trying to hard to write a full album worth of songs.  A worthwhile purchase nonetheless.
B000ANVQ0K|2.0|I cant believe these days making all hard work and extended version and double disk and three desk an so on and so on, how come is not DTS?/?? This is year 2000's, not 90s, damn 5.1, is dated audio. These days surround sound system is getting cheap and cheaper, most people these days have the system in their home  ...This movie is soo big with great sound effect, u have to have the DTS to blast and real enjoy the movie, or movies in this kind of gender, for this important matter I am not going to buy this crap DVD!
0316168815|4.0|The Lovely Bones weaves a beautiful story from a sad concept.  Told from the point of view of a dead teenage girl who now resides in heaven, we meet many characters who have affected her (and she has affected) throughout life and death.   <br /> <br />It's worthwhile to spend some time on this novel.  Although I didn't see it as a page-turner, I did not struggle to finish it.  The whole story was completely satisfying.  Alice Sebold does not disappoint, and who hasn't wondered what heaven is like?  The Lovely Bones paints an interesting theory.
B00007BHOE|5.0|i've had this dvd for over a year now and it still kicks my a$$!!!  like everyone else says, it definately feels like you are there.  invite some friends over to your house and crank this sucker up and you'll really feel like youre at a concert.  Must have for any slipknot fan
B00007BK2N|4.0|As a fan of New Order and Joy Division this was on the top of my list. Fast-paced, witty, and shot in documentary like style, 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like GO, ALL GONE PETE TONG, GROOVE, etc. Winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and Steve Coogan is terrific. The soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high. Not to be missed by fans (not ultimate fans) and general movie goers alike.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is without a doubt the best collection I have heard all year. Sufjan Stevens blends elements of Steve Reich, Slap Happy and Simon and Garfunkel into a colorful tapestry of personal events and isolated recollections. There is an overwhelming sense of vunerability, self actualization and hindsight throughout this simple under-produced masterpiece which has a reminiscence of a High School Orchestra rehersal. Take note that every song is good on this record which is extremely rare in American music in this day and age. Completely unadulterated by the restraints of the commercial musical industrial complex. Sufjan Stevens expounds his personality in every tune which makes the listener feel that he personally knows him by the end of this collection. \\"Chicago\\", I feel is the strongest track as I keep playing it over and over again and everyone that I have \\"turned-on\\" to \\"ILLINOISE\\" has loved it. Sorry friends I refuse to \\"burn\\" you a copy! You will have to buy your own copy to support this great artist. I can't wait to hear more.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|just Bought the 25th Anniversary Edition of Guilty today and just finished Listening to it and watching it and it feels like brand new music to me(even if it is 25 years old). If you have the regular Guilty CD and you think you dont need the new Dual Disc, TRUST ME, YOU DO! First  Off, Listening to the Songs on the DVD player is so much better, the Sound is Awesome, almost like Barbra and Barry are in your living room. Secondly, the DVD side is PACKED with Goodies, such as Barbra and Barry in an Interview talking about when they first did this Record and the upcoming 'guilty pleasures\\" cd's. Also featured are two Duets of Barbra and Barry performing from her \\"Once Voice\\" concert back in 1986. Her one voice video is NOT scheduled for release in that 5 Pack DVD of her First 5 tv specials, so , so far, this is your only chance to get these two cuts(guilty/what kind of fool) on DVD. There is also a photo gallery  of the Guilty photography sessions back in 1980 and many of these photos are being seen for the first time. I am SO EXCITED about the upcoming \\"GUILTY PLEASURES\\" CD, that this Special Edition of Guilty s the perfect companion for the new release! Barbra, you keep getting better and Better!  I Love You!
B00006IX0R|1.0|90s alternative rock at its worst (aside from Smashing Pumpkins, that is). That Irish-accented woman singer in this group is annoying as hell. There's one song where she goes \\"ah ah ah ah\\" for about 45 seconds. What is that? Imitation Yoko Ono? How can anybody call this good? The band is OK, but once she starts her carterwalling, forget it. \\"Crapberries\\" is more like it.
B0009RCPX4|5.0|This was one of my favorites when I was young and I can't wait to see it again ! Plus it has that cool song in it \\"Who you gonna call ? Ghostbusters !
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I love this new album. It sounds different from their self-titled album but, most of the tracks are really good. Their sound is original and fresh and the lyrics are really deep. However, the album is 'Copy Protected'. Since I am an I Pod user, I can't transfer the songs. That sucks...
0895260131|5.0|This book will upset those who have bought into the sanitized view of Islam as just another faith that is roughly equivalent to Judaism and Christianity or any other \\"faith community\\".  Islam does not view itself that way and neither should we.  Here we get a concise telling of the origins of Islam, what Muhammad actually did in spreading his faith.<br /><br />The explanation the book gives of the vast difference in the way Islam views believers and unbelievers (this includes Jews and Christians as well as polytheists and atheists) and it is quite important for all non-Muslims to understand this clearly.  The Islamic view of rightness involves only what is good for the promotion of Islam.  There is no sense of equality or fair play or pluralism in Islamic society.  It is quite all right to lie to non-Muslims if it promotes Islam.  This is why Islamic leaders say such apparently pluralistic things in English, but in Arabic they share their true and hostile views quite openly.  The Islamist view is that where they are the majority, there should be no other religion.  While they do not force conversions per se, they make life so hard on non-Muslims that over time many do convert.  Where Muslims are the minority they view the majority as holding unjust power.  After all, the whole world is Allah's and anyone should submit to that view, or so Muslims believe.<br /><br />Remember that when you read anything from CAIR.  You need to carefully translate what they are saying with the idea that they do not accept pluralism or even the American Constitution as desirable.  Their goal is to make America and every other country a Muslim state.<br /><br />The second part of this book shares information about the Crusades.  Again, this is valuable because about the only thing anyone is taught about the Crusades these days is that they were acts of Christian aggression.  In truth, they were a response to Islamic hostility in conquering European lands.  Remember, that Islam has tried to conquer Europe many times since the seventh century.  They held most of Spain for seven hundred years and were at the gates of Vienna in the seventeenth century.  Certainly, atrocities, by our standards, were committed.  However, Islamic aggression towards Europe was not brought about because of actions the Christian nations took (except for not submitting to Islam).<br /><br />Part Three of the book talks about the continuing Jihad on the part of the Islamicists and how it is connected to the strict version of Islam supported by Saudi Arabia and Iran's Islamic Revolution.  There is a reason they still talk about the Crusades.  They have never abandoned their goal of Talibanizing the world (to use a modern term for it).  And now they have billions upon billions of dollars of Oil Money to fund their ambitions.<br /><br />The book has lots of side notes.  Some are on books that you might want to read on the various topics discussed in the book.  They are all delightfully non-PC.  There are also bulleted nuggets of information on Islam and some boxes comparing the teachings of Jesus and Muhammad.  The author has provided ample endnotes and a useful index.<br /><br />To get a lot from this book you do not need to agree with what the author is saying.  You simply have to read it and wrestle with his points rather than simply dismissing them or even accepting them uncritically.<br /><br />Just read it!s tried to conquer Europe many times since the seventh century.

B0009KA7BS|5.0|First things first: It's the Devil's son that is coming back in this movie, not the Devil himself, Mr. Vampire.  <br /> <br />Second: I'm not going to waste time repeating what the movie was about, thats what the back cover is for <br /> <br />Third: Comic book movies, although not tying very often to the original story line of the books, have been rising in popularity, and I have personally been impressed. Of course that monstrosity Hulk followed by th BIG LETDOWN Punisher almost completely murdered my interest in comic movies forever, until Neo came back from the dead to vanquish demons. I'll be the first to admit, KEANU REEVES IS THE SAME PERSONALITY IN EVERY!!! MOVIE HE'S IN. That aside, he finally matched his personality to the perfect typewritten character (John Constantine). It suit's him well, now all we need is for Mr. Smith to come back in the sequel and this will be my all time favorite series. <br /> <br />Fourth: The only thing I regreted about this film is the inexcusable BOY MEETS WORLD, he's livable in the opening scene but after that he just gets in the way. <br />
B00005JODA|2.0|I haven't read the novel, but based on ads and the gushing critic reviews peppering the landscape, I had high hopes for this movie.  Sadly, they weren't met.  The acting is great; Fiennes is one of my favorite actors, and he's in rare form here.  Rachel Weisz is also outstanding.  The look of the film is killer, as to be expected from the director/cinematographer duo that brought us the dazzling \\"City of God\\" a few years ago.  But the film as a whole just doesn't hold together for me, largely due to a nagging sense of deja vu.  Follow me here (SPOILERS):  a man's wife is murdered; the powers that be tell him what happened; he doesn't believe their version, and spends the rest of the film looking for the real truth behind the death of his wife; the trail ultimately leads to an evil pharmaceutical company, protecting its interests and untold future billions to be reaped from a miracle drug that everyone will want; truth is outed in a public forum, revealing the greedy scumbags for what they are.  Now, did I just describe the plot of \\"The Constant Gardener\\"?  Nope, I was talking about Harrison Ford's movie version of \\"The Fugitive\\".  That this is being touted as one of the year's best films says a lot about the lack of quality filmmaking and the shortness of the American attention span, I guess...
B000AADYYO|5.0|Is it possible for Opeth not to rock? Apparently it isn't. Ghost Reveries serves yet another amazing and glorious helping of all that Opeth is, only maybe in larger portions. The heavy stuff is heavier, the quiet, pretty stuff is better and often more experimental, and the progressive elements of this album are even more polished and amazing than ever before. This is a band that just simply NEVER disappoints. The more prominent role of keyboards is a very nice and tasteful addition to this album, as well. All things considered, Ghost Reveries is fantastic.
0156027321|5.0|I could not put this book down..... it explores the mind in ways that one can only see by reading and re reading the book. A highly imoprobably sitiuation (a boy and a tiger surviving on lifeboat) is made not only plausable, but it also seems to be the only possible explanation. Yann ends the story in such a beautiful way that would cause the reader to wonder, 'what in my life is real, and what is perceived?'  <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I have anxiously been awaiting the release of Death Cab's new album for a good while now, and I have to say that it was definitely worth the wait, and then some.  I had read that some thought this album was only half good, and I don't agree with that at all.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and this is mine.  Death Cab has quickly become one of my very favorite bands, and I am glad that I was able to get into them before they were so widely known/recognized.  \\"Plans\\" makes me love them and their brilliance even more, on so many different levels.  Benjamin Gibbard is one of the most prolific, intelligent singer/songwriters I have come across in years, and he continues to amaze on this wonderful, fantastic album.  Perhaps the band hasn't grown by leaps and bounds just yet, but give them time; it's always important to evolve as an artist, and I will be there in support as a loyal fan, every step of the way.  Gradual changes are always better than drastic ones, and I just know this band is going to go far....I have every faith on Ben and the boys.  \\"Plans\\" is absolutely one of the best albums I have heard this year, hands down.
B000002MUN|5.0|There are those who would have you believe Tom Petty's best work is far behind him.  Yet greatness is often misunderstood in it's own time.  Such is the case with Wildflowers.  This is without a doubt his most 'spiritual' album.   It explores the depths of <br />the human experience.  However, to understand this you must <br />listen to this album several times.   This album is without peer in his collection.
1400032717|5.0|The perspective provided in this book is very insightful.  The lead character was so human and so purposeful.  This will gain understanding on so many levels.  The annotation was terriffic.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Let me first start out by saying please disregard everything written by that reviewer before me. Obviously (s)he has no idea what a good movie, good acting or good directing is all about. Either that or they must've seen another movie.<br /><br />John Carpenter is one of the best known directors in the annals of horror movie history and did a phenomenal job of making one of the most suspenseful and influential horror films in the genre's history. If there was a horror movie hall of fame. Carpenter would be inducted first ballot along with the character Michael Myers. Halloween is not just for horror fans, it's a well acted suspenseful roller coaster that is made even more effective by the incredible score (done by Carpenter himself)<br /><br />If you haven't seen Halloween I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who loves a good, gripping suspenseful movie. One other thing to the reviwer before me (ever heard of Jamie Lee Curtis??)
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|One of the best Video Game to Movie titles i ahve seen i a while. And the women are hot!
0312995423|1.0|The author shows such ignorance in math, computing, the NSA, geography and history that makes you think about how unreliable are his books. Didn't he learn that an author must document himself? <br />His description of Spain is ridiculous, an insult to anybody's intelligence, and of course to the Spaniards. Not only he has never been to Spain, he has never read anything about Spain or Europe. He confuses Spain in the 1990s with Mexico in the 1860s. <br />I wonder if he cannot afford some Cable TV (Discovery Channel will do) and learn a little more about the World, Europe and Spain. <br />I'm not asking him to read, too tough for him. <br />
B000A3DFZE|5.0|What can be said about this man.  He came from a 16 yr old Mom and without a father.  He was an excellent student of the arts. A rather quiet kid, he got his first guitar at the age of 12 and the story begins.  He was around the greatest of the greats in his early years.  John Mayall found him and the rest is written in the annals of time.  The first supergroup Cream, and then a string of supergroups, Blind Faith, Derek and The Dominoes, the list goes on and on.  and now, at 61, he emerges as the true rock and roll crusader.  He has made the trip there and back.  He overcame heroin addiction, he owns a treatment center in the Carribean.  What else can be said about this man who came to my home town, Dallas Texas, to entertain the people in the Cotton Bowl with his down home, just a bunch of friends, attitude.  He loved my great friend Stevie Ray Vaughan. Eric is a friend to his people, his fans, those of us who were there when Cream rolled into town a few times, there when Derek was around, and many Eric Clapton and his band shows...Yes, what more can be said..about a thousand pages...over and over and over...Eric is The One and Only real Rock and Roller, the Classic Rocker..Clapton was then and is today God to those who love his music...
B00003CXCQ|1.0|The film will not run.  1: Title 'Show White'appears on screen but cannot be accessed in any way.  2: Then there is 'clip' that do open but is useless.  3:  Does not open either.  At the right side is an icon that does nothing but indicate that it is Dolby sound. <br /> <br />The film just does not operate!
B0000029GA|5.0|19 year old Nasir Jones after 2 successful cameo appearances(MC Serch's Back To The Grill and Main Source's Live At The BBQ)drops his debut gem in 1993.  Illmatic is best described by the title of my review.  I'm not going to elaborate because I will only be describing the same feelings conveyed by the other 500 plus reviewers. This was Nas' and hip hop's answer to the Chronic era made famous by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.  Nas' lyrics have always been politically fueled and streetwise with neck snapping beats.  However, Illmatic was able to recruit hip hop's A-list of producers including DJ Premier, Large Professor, Q-Tip and Pete Rock.  His first single \\"Halftime\\" was a carryover song from the Zebrahead movie soundtrack and his first(technically)released single from the album was \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" using an interpolation of Michael Jackson's Human Nature with one of my most favorite hip hop verses of all time(hence my nickname)...\\"Nas is like the half eccentric Asian/Half man half amazing\\".  A jewel that hip hop fans, young and old will enjoy.
B00007LTIL|5.0|Aside from the european tour album or the ideosyncratic terrapin station this is THE essential Grateful Dead classic. As the dead releases are more or less compilations and recompilations this is the one that shares its material with those compilations. Ok want to have a comprehensive collection buy  Dicks Picks all 150 cds! (Don't know. Am I exagerating????) But if you only want to fork out for one cd then this is it! Latest edition with even more bangs for your bucks.

B000AADYYO|5.0|If you're tired of monotonous metal music, then better buy this now! All albums of Opeth sounds good! <br /> <br />Opeth is not Melodic Metal or whaterver \\"Melodic\\". They are Progressive Death Metal! Melodic metal bands tend to be so boring that all of them sounds the same.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Jared Leto just lets his voice rip in this one!!! Just as great as the first album, which was so unique for its spacey kind of chords in the backgrounds but totally dominated with some of the greatest guitar strings!!!! An instant classic, with awesome lyrics, guitars  and finally letting lead singer Jared Leto truely shine.
B00005JODA|5.0|Slow tension building thriller that is charge even more with the great performances of Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes, who both bring an essence of realism to their roles and a sense of chemistry that is really not found in movies like this anymore. Rachel Weisz brings a ferry fury that is ripe in it's convictions and Ralph Fiennes brings a cool, collective zeal that is a slow building timer ready to emotionally exploded at any minute.  Both performances compliment the fine directing of Fernando Meirelles, who gives this tale a sense of brilliance in its storytelling and a sense of the way the world really works. It's a heartfelt story of lost and redemption and it's hauntingly poetic in it's horrifying look at the horrors of a world that is willing to cast a blind eye at the problems of big business and corrupt governments that are willing to do anything in order to make a fast buck. Even going as far than to destroy human life to achieve their goals.  <br /> <br />This is a brilliant film and I can't wait to see it again.  <br />
0767817710|5.0|Sam Raimi's \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" is basically a stereotypical western with stereotypical characters in a stereotypical plot but filmed by master Sam Raimi who uses these stereotypes to create a film so pure in the genre that it surprises. Each scene is painstakingly crafted to achieve the purpose intended, Raimi wastes no scene. A stable of fine actors is used most notably the legendery Gene Hackman, but the real talent in the film is the always interesting point of view Raimi places the camera to achieve the desired effect. This film is stylish and constantly takes chances with the believability of the characters, but it all works and Raimi delivers plenty of humor, action and thrills and enough violence to make Sam Peckinpah blush. Hard core western film buffs may scoff at Raimi's camera work, but for the rest it should be highly entertaining.
0895260131|5.0|This is an absolutely first class book and should be essential reading for anyone who has aspirations for political leadership. Systematically the author debunks the liberal arguement that Islam is a tolerant religion that can coexist easily with others and that jihad against unbelievers (the West) is the aspiration of a very few. It tells how main stream Islam is intolerant to unbelievers unless they take a subservient position and pay tribute, treats women appallingly and that the Islamisation of the World is central to its belief and that almost any action is justified in achieving this objective. It also places the Crusades into their historical context. They were not wars of imperial expansion but a belated attempt to wrest back part of the Western world which had been overrun by arabs and maintain the holy places for Western pilgrimage. The First Crusade was initiated by a call for help from the Byzantine Emperor and promoted by the Pope. It was not a land grab by landless noblemen. <br /> <br />The book is rivetting and details the dangers the West is in and the price of its failure to believe in itself and its manifest achievements which dwarf anything Islam has been able to achieve in the arts, sciences and the betterment of humankind. <br /> <br />Buy it and read it from cover to cover.
0064430227|5.0|This book is so special for children and for adults! Harold creates his own magical world with only a simple crayon. It promotes the wonder of imagination in children, and is truly a classic book. Every child should own this book (and that goes for adult sized children too!)
B0009XT8YW|5.0|How awsome is this that this late in the game Barbra will and is back on top. Reeling from the success of Meet The Fockers and her new Album \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" \\"in stores September 20,2005\\" Barbra I predict will once again make music history.  Of course this is the first installment of the Streisand / Gibb colaboration - and what a pop, perfected, masterpiece it is.  Barbra's voice glides with this material and the new elements and musical styles that Gibb brought to the forefront in this record are sealed in gold and platinum.    If you love Guilty - you will adore Guilty Pleasures - the only problem Barbra and Barry will have is the irony of this album's title  - for fans and critics will be delighted to admit that they are Guilty again.
B00070QXL8|2.0|As described above, The Edge of Reason does not live up to its prequel.  The whole movie revolves around Bridget Jone's jealousy and lack of confidence--common themes that falter relationships as we know.  What this film lacks from the first one is Bridget's directedness as well as her courage to go after the man of her dreams.  Where is the heroine who chases after Darcy in her panty?  If you're a Colin Firth fan, you'll get to see a lot of him in this one.  But I find him not as adorable as before just because he doesn't do anything to get Bridget back into his arms.  I mean, if his love was never wavered despite of her clumsiness and inability to reason as a normal human being, as shown in the first one, why would he agree to break up with her without uttering a word.  Humor wise, well there are some humorous scenes, but most of them are involved Daniel Cleaver, as Hugh Grant remains to be the funniest role in both movies (though still a fat liar.)  I was disappointed after watching it, though I didn't regret spending money on the DVD just because of the bonus piece of which Bridget Jones interviewed Colin Firth.  She kept on and on about his wet-shirt look in Pride and Prejudice.  It was outrageously funny, and I thought that should've been included in the film rather than the skydiving scene, which was a total repeat of the firestation scene in the first movie.  If you love the first movie and you are the kind who will die if you don't ever find out the possibility of \\"happily ever after\\" between Mark and Bridget, do watch this movie to fulfill your curiosity.  But if you think the story had ended perfectly with Darcy's line \\"Oh yes they f*cking do\\" in replying to Bridget's remark about how nice boys don't have wickedly awesome kissing skills, perhaps this movie will disappoint.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Just an aside to this reviewers praise of Mariah Carey - yes this album is pure pop magic for Carey and I am happy for her fans that she is back.  Who knew she would out last Whitney.  I guess Mariah did.  However, Barbra Streisand is certified as the number #1 selling female US artist of all time.  Mariah broke records with her singles - not album sales. Album sales records - That's Streisand.  Carey is still a force to be reconed with though - so you go Mariah.
B00005JNTX|1.0|First, 2 words on the SPFX and the way it's filmed: SO WHAT? Would you eat a plate of crap & onions at a fancy restaurant just because they pretty it up? No, and so too should you not assign artistic merit to this kind of crap just because of how it's filmed. I will only be addressing the (lack of) quality in the story, which tops John Waters' A Dirty Shame for stupidest movie of the year award. Don't think I'm offended at all by the violence; I grew up on a daily diet of slasher films and action movies, thrilling over beheadings and such. But unless you're 12 years old, there's nothing much to interest anyone of average intelligence or maturity. And the nudity isn't even satisfying. Frank Miller in interviews looks like one of those scary gunshop owners who are obsessed with conspiracy theories and Nam, and I suppose this film reflects what results from giving someone like that the funds to write and direct a movie. I'm utterly embarrassed for the actors in it, some of whom are ordinarily good if given decent dialog and characters--not here obviously! And the virtual reality/video game action scenes are an insult to one's intelligence. Having someone get hit by a car a few times, get up and brush it off only works for superheroes. And stepping off a ledge and landing on one's feet also requires superhuman ability, as in Underworld where it is filmed much better and looks way cooler. The only thing I liked was how they reworded \\"filmed and edited by\\" as \\"shot and cut by\\" in the opening credits, reflecting the violent nature of the film. But it went all downhill from there.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|Great DVD for any fan of The Eagles/Joe Walsh.  A few critical points need to be touched on.....First-Joe, you wrote better songs before rehab.  Nobody cares if you're taking it 'One Day At A Time'.  Second-Glen, you're no substitute for Randy Meisner on \\"Take It To The Limit\\".  Let it go. <br />Last-Give the poor sap on guitar who is shuffled off to the dark side of the stage some acknowledgment. The guy holds his own against Frey and Walsh and more than carries his weight.   <br />Aside from the above stated, it's a great concert that I'd rank up there beside \\"The Last Waltz\\".  Great sound and visual quality.  Good camera work.  Great selection of songs (except for the newer crap).  Still would've been nice to hear songs like \\"Ol'55\\", \\"Doolin Dalton\\" \\"Out Of Control\\" etc....
0446677450|5.0|If you need a self-help book with the foundations to SPEND less I recommend this one.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This last studio effort by Maiden is surely a standout. The guitar lines sound a bit heavier and the production is well crafted. As for the lyrics, they went back to the glorious times, when Maiden wrote about interesting epic episodes, just like on \\"Powerslave\\". Steve Harris and the other boys show us here how they can start things over after those disappointing albuns from the 90's. The following list shows how I assessed each track on the album, through grades that range from 0 to 10: <br /> <br />1) Wildest Dreams: 8 <br />2) Rainmaker: 10 <br />3) No more lies: 9 <br />4) Montsegur: 8 <br />5) Dance of death: 10 <br />6) Gates of tomorrow: 9 <br />7) New Frontier: 8 <br />8) Paschendale: 10 <br />9) Face in the sand: 8 <br />10) Age of innocence: 7 <br />11) Journeyman: 9

B00000JG41|5.0|This is an amazing album! if you love good music then you must listen to this.  Although I am a big fan of Mike Patton, and i love clean music, i am not just speaking in such greatness of this album because i think he and his musical comrades are geniuses.  the other Mr. Bungle albums were great, but too sporadic in composition i felt and i barely listen to them anymore as they don't grab me really such as this does. this album, after having it for like 3 years now, just still sounds better and better after every listen.  the songs are too amazing to describe with words, and every song is completely different than the next, unlike the other albums which all have a same crazy vibe going on throughout them, though of course i appreciate them a lot. \\"California\\" is a miracle in music!

B00008973Q|5.0|The film is stunning -- a reenvisioning of King Lear, but set in the Japanese feudal period.  It may be Kurosawa's most impressive film -- combining the bloody realism of Seven Samurai's war scenes with his keen insight into the establishing of mood through gesture with an incredible eye for color that is displayed in, say, Dreams.<br /><br />The DVD transfer, on both the Fox Lorber and Masterworks edition, is at best passable -- a mere hint of the stunning beauty of the film (I find my VHS copy to be an improvement on both of these).  But there is good news!!! A criterion release is on the way in November!!  With a film like this, where the look is so amazing in the original, it is not worth it to go with a cheap transfer.  Wait for the real thing, or the closest you can get without owning a theater and renting the 35mm print.

B0007TKNII|5.0|This has to be my most favourite film ever!!!!  I have all the versions of this wonderful story, and had the tremendous pleasure of seeing the play twice in Melbourne (Australia). <br />This is so close to the stage play, and has the added extras and nuances that can only be captured on film. <br />I was disappointed that Michael Crawford wasn't the phantom till I laid eyes on Gerard Butler's character, and I was lost...he is so sexy!!!!!  even after the exposure of his deformity he was still gorgeous.....his character made the insipid Raoul even more uninteresting. <br />Emmy Rossum was just perfect,  and her performance was - I think - so much better that the short film clips I've seen of Sarah Brightman,  whose voice is superb, but presented a very blank and expressionless Christine.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta is so refreshing and a delight to watch and listen to. <br />I watch or listen to this dvd every day, I just can't get enough of it,  and really cannot understand how anyone wouldn't love it as much as I do.    5 stars seems a very inadequate rating...... <br />

6305842442|5.0|I have this Limited Edition Collector's Set heh but to be honest I haven't watched it yet,I've over 1000 dvds includin the boxset so I aint got much to watch'em :p
B000002JSP|5.0|I still enjoy it. Yes, I don't listen to it as much as their other albums, but I put it in the cd player more then Coda. In Through the Out Door is a different turn for Zeppelin and most fans don't like it. Well, whoopie. I still like it, because it's still good music, even though it's not classic Zeppelin. Anyways, it sounds different, I can't really compare the sound to anything else, it has it's own Zeppeliny twist to it and yes it has synthesizers. I still respect the band for trying something different, people are always so down on change, I say if they wan't to change let them. Diversity is great quality in a band, look at Floyd, they change their sound all over the place and it's darn awesome. In Through the Out Door is my least favorite of the 8 studio albums, but I still enjoy it.<br /><br />My favorite songs are All My Love(gets some radio play which is cool), Fool In the Rain, I'm Gonna Crawl and Carouselambra.<br /><br />To be honest, the album is strange for someone as great a Led Zeppelin, it's silly at times, quite moving with I'm Gonna Crawl, it's fun and it's just really interesting listening to it knowing who it is and man were they gutsy, but hey, think what you want. I wasn't big on it at first and I rarely listen to it now, but theres just something about it that makes me enjoy it a bunch. I just have great respect for Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />The album cover is pretty cool too. I even have the old vinyl of it from a friend that was getting rid of albums that is. One more thing, Hot Dog is a very silly, fun square dancing kinda song that makes me smile and dance everytime I listen to it, quite goofy for Zeppelin.
B000069AT7|5.0|heh we grew Up watchin this Great Movie E.T ,I own this Ultimate Editionand 'tis one of my Favorite movies ever, you won't regret it too :)
B00005JODA|5.0|Better than the book adaptation of the John Le Carre novel has a great director like Fernando Meirelles at the helm and two amazing actors like Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes at the wheel to steer this movie into Oscar heaven with two brilliant performance that will not be match for sometime to come. Ralph Fiennes is just great as a grieving man out to find out the circumstances of his wife's murder and the reasons behind it. His performance is a texture of desperation and self-discovery and he begins to show faith in not only his wife's memory but in the world itself in his way to find justice. While Fiennes gives a great performance, it's truly Rachel Weisz who shines the most with he complex, powerful and tricky performance. We only get to know her from flashbacks and dialog from people who have met her character and from Justin himself. Some of those flashbacks are deceiving but all of them make up a total character who is structured enough towards the end to get a real picture of who she was. It's a tightrope of a performance and Rachel Weisz not only serves it up with class and strong will but with grace as well. She literally gives the performance of the year and it would be a crime towards real cinema if she were not recognizes for her efforts come Oscar time.  <br /> <br />Fernando Meirelles gives his all in this film in terms of technical brilliance and he gets great support from Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes who with his effort give this year's first great film. <br />
B00009TB5G|5.0|You gotta ADD This 4 Disc set Extended Edition to yer Collection,It rocks :P
0312335164|4.0|In this novel Dan Brown weaves a tremendously thrilling story around code-breaking, the National Security Agency, and internet technology. Cryptography is the emphasis of the novel, and Brown does a great job in detailing its history, implications and various forms without going overboard. The whole novel is standard Dan Brown for those who have already read one of his other novels. The duration of the story is just 24 hours and includes Seville, Spain as its exotic European locale. Brown also uses a Georgetown University Professor of Languages for his Robert Langdon/Indian Jones character. <br /> <br />Like Brown's other novels I could not put this one down. While the mystery in this novel was somewhat lacking, the suspense certainly wasn't. It is a very quick read - much more so than DA VINCI CODE or ANGELS & DEMONS. I enjoyed this novel. As far the others who say that the plot is too implausible, IMO it is the most credible novel he has written. However, this book is FICTION. In most fiction - including Dan Brown's other novels - one has to suspend some disbelief. <br />
6305662371|5.0|This's what I did,I bought THE EXORCIST The Version you've never Seen and I added it in this Limited Edition Collector's Set ,,'tis one of my  Favorite Scary Movies:P <br />
B000000W5H|4.0|having revelled in the music of sticky fingers, let it bleed and exile, being a careful buyer of cds, for a long time i avoided buying the \\"other\\" stones albums which mick taylor had played on, mainly because of the not so favorable reviews. a few months back i succumbed to my temptation and bought goats head soup. the album is not consistent as a whole and atbest shines in parts. my control lasted for another 3 months before i bought its only rock n roll.    pleasantly surprised. apart from two weak tracks the rest of the songs are classic stones and can compare with most other stones classics. if you cant rock me, aint too proud and its only rock n roll are concert staples so it is not necessary for me to expand on them. time waits for no one is a classic with an exceptional solo by taylor. but is it his greatest achievement? i think not - that i think is reserved for his solo on sway in sticky fingers. but still the fret work here is exceptional. the not so heavy tone of the guitar seems to suggest that he might have taken to playing a stratocaster. also the playing style is so remniscent of dicky betts solo on \\"blue sky\\". not surprising since both the guitarists incline towards the melodic.     in the second set of songs, luxury is a sweet offbeat number with some trademark richards riffing. 'if you really want to be my friend' is jagger's excuse to sound like rod stewart and fingerprint file is funky and interesting. the two not so good tracks in the album imo are dance little sister and short and curlies, where jagger annoyingly keeps repeating the same verses - but again both tracks boast of some interesting guitar work courtesy taylor (as does most of the tracks on the album).    mick taylor's presence/contribution is acutely felt here on this album - much more than let it bleed or exile. though his fret work is amazing in itself one cant but escape the feeling that his heart wasnt fully in it. (maybe i'm being over critical here - as i always am when it comes to mick taylor, because my expectations of him are so high)!    one cant help but note that the album has an almost sad and wistful ring to it - check the track titles - almost 70% of the tracks seem negatively inclined! maybe at some level it was  the artistic moment of truth for the band after the series of great albums they came up with, one after another and they keenly felt the pressure to live up to the high expectations.    but it is a great album - very underrated. GET IT!
B0001907DA|5.0|Perfect Collection,Who doesn't own this Collection? heh I have Police Academy on LASERDISC And I have this DVD Boxset too,You gotta add'em to your Collection :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never watched this on TV but a friend of mine suggested it to me and I thought it was great. I cannot believe that it was cancelled after only 1 season.  I am going to go see the movie (Serenity) as soon as it opens.
B00008YLV2|5.0|I own this 3 disc set Edition,'tis a great WAR Movie and I enjoyed 'tis DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 as well :)
B00005JLEU|5.0|I can't understand how people can be giving this a review of one star. So many are justifying it by saying that they are a fan of anime but it's not Miyazaki's best work...Hello?! This is the largest grossing and most successful film in Japanese box office history?!!! That surely will give you some indication that this film was appreciated by a LOT of people. There are also reviews stating that this film is too scary and emotionally scarring for younger viewers... I can't think of a single moment where i felt mildly frightened. Granted, the scene where she first enters the spirit world could be 'scary' for some younger viewers but no more so than something along the lines of E.T.. and yes, there is a bit of blood in the film (dragon blood i might add) - well anyone who's watched Japanese animation will know that this is not so uncommon and truly not something to get overly worked up about. I would reccommend this film for any viewer of any age. At the end of the day..it's your call - nobody's forcing you or your children to watch it but bear in mind it was recently voted #3 in the top 100 cartoons of all time. Surely part of you wants to check this out? I just cant help but notice this film recieves almost solely 5 or 1 star ratings..and those giving it one star give the impression of being unimaginative, uncreative and unwilling to bother with a film that requires some thought to fully appreciate it for what it is. The artwork is immense. Enough said
B00003CXAA|5.0|I OWN This DVD Collection ,And I just wonder will The Director's CUT EDITION BE Released ON DVD too? I Shouldn't have The Old LASERDISC BOXSET :(
B00005O438|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for years.  I remember watching it all the time when I was little.  I would buy this movie a million times over.
B000089RVX|5.0|As a fan of Linkin Park (which you could probably tell if you have read any of my LP reviews), I am constantly looking for a band that could even possibly rival LP for my favorite band... and I haven't found one yet.  However, this band is already in the #2 spot and gaining fast.  When I first heard this band, it was on the \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack, and they were awesome. So, I got this CD and popped it into the CD player in my car.  I was immediately impressed with lead singer Amy Lee's ethereal voice on \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Bring Me to Life\\" and her powerful vocals on \\"Everybody's Fool\\".  When I got to my girlfriend's house, we started to listen to it again, this time at the track \\"Haunted\\".<br /><br />By the time it was over, I had tears welling up in my eyes, and by the time the next track, \\"Tourniquet\\" had ended, so did Michelle... Anyways, with the combination of Lee's heartwrenching voice and the jamming guitars of a Gimli (LOTR) lookalike, this is a band no one can afford to miss, and this album is bound to establish a fan base rivaling that of Eminem and Linkin Park (maybe).  I know that I won't be discarding this CD easily. A definite 100/100.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|Or, may I should say, no where near what it sould've been. This movie is horrible in terms of following the book. Even with Clive Cussler himself supposedly getting cast and script approval; something that Hollywood of course was not willing to follow up on. <br /> <br />First and foremost, they left out almost everything that made the book so exciting, and either pointlessly changed it or added something else just to make the film more action.  <br /> <br />The book was not a shot 'em up action story like this was. While the book had reasons and explanations for everything, This movie fails to explain several key points and leaves the audience guessing at what's going on at certain points. <br /> <br />Another problem was the characters that were altered by Hollywood writers. It is just sad. They've made Al Giordino into a moron; that's the truth. Just watch the movie to see what I mean. He doesn't even seem to take his job seriously. <br /> <br />Rudy Gunn is barely in it at all, and when we do see him, he's made up like a nerd and is a total joke. Not the officer and valuble asset to NUMA we saw in the books. <br /> <br />Dirk Pitt has been turned into a treasure hunter; basically a man hired by NUMA to handle thier dirty work for them. He only seems interested in the rewards this job brings him. (i.e, loads of cash. This seems to go hand in hand with how the intro's subplot was altered). He also is not an ex Air Force Major, but an ex Navy Commander, like he was in Raise the Titanic. <br /> <br />Sandecker was mostly correct, just way too arogant sometimes. <br /> <br />Dr, Eva Rojas...well, just watch the film. I'm not sure how to describe her in this. <br /> <br />I am so disapointed with Hollywood over this. I'm going to go as far as to say that Hollywood has stabbed us Cussler fans in the back, as well as the doctor himself.  <br /> <br />You owe us a good Dirk Pitt movie, Hollywood. Take notes from all the negative feedback Sahara got, and get it right nexttime. We don't want yet another \\"Raise the Titanic.\\"
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King's It is a great scary movie and not only that,but every since i have seen it i don not like clowns whatsoever!!!!!! It has a great cast which includes the late beloved John Ritter!!!!!!! The story takes place in a town called Derry and these kids which are called the losers are entered in this supernatural world and brings them to a clown by the name of Pennywise which takes children down to the storm drains!!!!!!! This movie does freak me out and it takes me a least a few weeks just to get over it!!!!!!! If you love Stephen King and you have read the book then go see this movie!!!!!
B000244EMO|5.0|This is easily one of Arnold's best, if not his best. I've loved this movie since I saw it a very long time ago. I've owned it for a while too, but my goodness..this movie kicks ass in every way! <br /> <br />The characters may not be the best developed, but that's not really the point of this. So much gunfire, action, death..explosions..there's so much to say about this movie. My favorite character is probably Jesse Ventura's who says \\"I ain't got time to bleed\\" and carries a handheld Gatling gun which shreds everyone to pieces. Yes, it's unrealistic (Gatling guns weigh way too much to be handheld), but quite fun to watch him tear apart his weak opponents.  <br /> <br />I think the best scene is when the commandos raid the small village. There is so many explosions, gunfire, and killing that it puts a lot of movies to shame these days. I always love this part. Another scene is when Mac (a character) sees the Predator which is stalking them for the first time and freaks out..you'll understand what I mean if you haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br />The thing about this movie is you are set up to think these commandos are badass and can't be stopped when they start getting destroyed by something that's stalking them...it's a good way to set up a movie; introduce badass, introduce a bigger badass. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of action movies, buy this. If you wanna see heavily armed commandos shoot a lot of things, buy this. If you're looking for a classic movie, buy this.  <br /> <br />Predator has everything...action...gunfire...explosions..badasses..a very well developed villan...and much more. I suggest if you don't have this movie, to BUY IT NOW! AT LEAST SEE IT ONCE ;) <br /> <br />If you've seen this movie and like it, I suggest you buy Aliens versus Predator 2 for the PC. Great game, and you can play as a Predator, Alien, or heavily armed Marine.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not only does Radiohead make some of the best emotional music. They are the best at this kind of music. If you listen to this cd and not feel anything then you must be dead. The best songs on this album are all of them. My favorites are paranoid android, exit music, karma police, no suprises, and lucky. Those of you who don't like radiohead. I can understand because I think only people who can reach deep inside themselves and actually connect with music will enjoy this. This type of music isn't for everyone. But for those who it is for it is pure pleasure to enjoy.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|I bought the CD after having heard \\"You're Beautiful\\" for two days straight, with no idea of who the hell James Blunt was. Now I know... he's a great singer/songwriter! This CD is nothing like the music I normally listen to (hard rock) but I just couldn't ignore the fact that the guy has a beautiful voice that leaves you hypnotized. My favourite tracks besides from the song that made me buy the album are Goodbye My Lover and Out Of My Mind, songs that simply took my breath away and, without sounding too girly here, almost made me cry! If you like You're Beautiful, you'll LOVE this album.

B0009UC810|2.0|First off let me say that I am a huge fan of the Blues Brothers movie.  I saw if for the first time the very weekend it came out and to this day, whenever its on TV, which is very often, I will flick it on and watch at least a little bit.  It's a film that is just as funny today as it was back then.  This is pure movie magic from the great music, to the multitudes of guest stars, to one of the greatest, certainly most destructive car chases in movie history.<br /><br />The problem isn't the film, but its the release.  It is nice to have the theatrical version to go along with the extended cut but the fact is this \\"anniversary edition\\" isn't much more than the special edition that just came out a few years ago.  The added featurettes such as the Belushi tribute and the lame House of Blues performance are NOT worth the $22.00 price tag or even the discounted price that Amazon is selling it for.  Certainly not if you own the previous collector's edition.  On top of that, having a double-sided disc is the ultimate in going cheap.  That's the kind of stuff you expect when you buy those bargain basement DVDs, not something from a big Studio like Universal.  What a shame that they couldn't put a bit more thought and cash into a truly legendary film.
B0009PRNVK|4.0|This concert is ok, but the thing that makes it really good is the fact thatthe band plays so many songs that you might never hear a live version of otherwise (unless you're lucky enough to have Eddie's Archive). This show is great because, not only does it contain 6 out of the 8 songs from Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, but it also has gems such as The Prisoner, Wasted Years and Die With Your Boots On!

0694518018|2.0|The abridged book on tape version (ISBN 0-694-51801-8) mostly covers market conditions in the early 1970s. (It's apparently an abridgement done in 1986 of a book Graham wrote in the early 1970s before his death in 1976). Yes, there is some historic interest here, but not enough of Benjamin Graham's timeless advice on investing. I recommend finding another version of Graham's work, unless you're an economic historian researching the early 1970s. <br /> <br />By the way, Graham's comments on the tape totally failed to foresee the big energy crisis and runaway inflation of the mid 1970s (as did 90%+ of investors then, including most other experts).

B000002LK1|5.0|Alan Wilder!!! need I say more? the guy is a genius, and he is best remembered here, especially on the track \\"enjoy the silence\\", it was once considered a ballad, but he did remake the song into an upbeat one, and it did in fact did become the bands greatest hit of all time. Why is it so perfect? Dave's voice alone, Dave sangs perfectly in this record, and as usual Martin Gore's song writing is superb, but what I like about Alan is that he polishes martin's songs, and his arrangements are extraordinary....     and towards the music of violator, its sounds dark, and it has an eerie atmosphere, though it was a mainstream record bec. it sold millions, but the music was never mainstream. all I can say is thank you Alan, this record is perfect all killer no filler.     and since Alan left, depeche mode was never the same.

0679721037|5.0|This is a great book. John Hersey follows six survivors of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima, using their experiences as a microcosm for the whole event. Rarely does he stray into scientific or historical background; neither is his approach political. He writes in spare, matter-of-fact language, so he cannot be accused of sentimentality or manipulation. He simply shows us what happened. By giving us an account of the lives of ordinary Japanese ruined by the atomic bomb, Hersey takes away our ability to see them simply as \\"the enemy.\\" I think this book makes a compelling case that, even in war, some options should be off the table. And it does so without ever sounding like an editorial, or indeed, making us aware of the writer at all. \\"Hiroshima\\" is an achievement on both an ethical and literary level.
0060825219|5.0|This is the first book iv read by paulo Coelho and i'm fascinated. Most people conform to the rigid rules of society which really do annoy us but we keep following them because we think they're the only way we can survive in today's world. Coelho writes about leaving those rules to some extent behind us and focusing more on how short life is...how even the smallest thing we do can bring us joy and we should enjoy those small things while we still can. To be passionate, loving and live for every moment in life. A powerful novel which makes you really think. Think about what life really is and whether you are really happy the way you are.
0765309408|5.0|Other reviewers have mention Heinlein and Haldeman, and that's pretty astonishing company for a first novel, don't you think? And it's so. Interesting characters, interesting plot. Doesn't get bogged down in technobabble, but what's there is plausible. Interesting character (too bad other characters aren't as well-drawn) and tightly edited (a considerable problem in today's bloated multi-volume \\"epics\\"). Well-done Mr. Scalzi.
0515127485|4.0|Archangel is the 2nd Harris book that I've read and I must say that it takes a certain flare for a book to really captivate me to the point of not being able to put it down, and Archangel succeeded, as did Fatherland.<br /><br />Anyway The Former Soviet Union is a crumbling shell of its former self. With rampant unemployment and inadequete wages for those who are employed. With former KGB in the underworld and secretaries who moonlight as hookers, all is not well in the former \\"Super Power.\\"<br /><br />Professor of History, Dr. \\"Fluke\\" Kelso stumbles onto the story of a lifetime, the preported existence of a Stalin Notebook, a journal of personnal writings from one of the most celebrated sociopaths the world has ever known. A work wrapped in an oilskin binding that could revolutionize the New Russia, and the world. But in the course of his journey Fluke will find out that Stalin left behind a bit more than his personnal thoughts.<br /><br />I'm telling you that this novel is one of the best that I've read in awhile, full of suspense, and history, which warms the heart of this History major, and an almost inside glimpse of what it means to live in Russia in this day and age.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon~ Pink Floyd is a very experimenta album that has definite touches of synth, rock, avantgarde and one can feel that they have listened to acts such as Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dreams to mention a few. The loops used are amazing and the use of the VCS3 is quite astounding and this is a very important album of many levels. They have also managed to write some nifty lyrics and their muisicianship is quite stupendous. Some of their experimental tracks sound a bit like Stockhausen and one can sense that Einsturzende Neubaten have taken clues from this album with its experimental and very different sound. I love the cover of the album and I love their vocals and their amazing lyrics. This is one important album and one of the first albums to tryly use electronic instruments and effects.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|I can't write a review on a product never received and credit never applied...Too Bad, Amazon just doesn't understand good business relations.
B0000508U6|1.0|I like Chris Martin's vocals, which is probably the most impressive part of the album.  but the rest sucks... All of the songs are the same, lame and uninteresting.  Yellow is a cute song, and shivers is pretty good but thats all.  It's cute but I don't think that these guys deserve to be the biggest band in the world.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Wonderful film and, what seem to be, excelent extras. Problem is, how many times can one pay for the same film ? Studios have reached my limit, if they haven't reached yours, good for you and be ready for the 10 year anniversary edition in 2010 !
B0000074BS|4.0|Keen for a cool return to the 1980's. The music is wavy Synth-pop, as opposed to the more clinical metallic sound of their 80's counterparts. Talk Talk plays with long and slow rythms but can accelerate to strong peaks when the painful yet poignantly poetic lyrics by Mark Hollis deserve it. I do not like the heroin-messed Chameleon Day that goes nowhere, but the transition to Time It's Time (definitely the BEST Talk Talk song) is superb. The children's choir in Hapiness Is Easy is just another proof of how the Group can integrate different types of music and yet come up with coherent songs that merge perfectly into a homogenous album. Living In Another World is a straight SOS from Hollis in which his voice is at last stretched and supported by the best arrangement of the album.

Track five has that part that starts at the 10 min. mark and goes until the end, 1min and 40sec later!! On Deliverance they did the same kind of thing, except it went on for 3MINUTES!!!!! <br />Of course they have long songs! Because they don't know when to stop. I would love an Opeth cd that had a bunch of short heavy songs instead of long heavy songs. The only songs that they ever do short is the mellow stuff and the mellow stuff on this cd isn't the best, it's not at the same level as Damnation. <br />Overall the cd is good. The first track is pretty awesome, one of my favorite songs by them, but it kind of looses steam from there. <br />BUT, even the worst Opeth cd is better than 95% of the music out there.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|I have to agree with most of what's already been said regarding the omission of a DTS soundtrack.<br /><br />During the fact subtitles at the end of the movie, it mentioned that it would have compromised the quality by including DTS and this set was supposed to complement the original 2000 release to make it a 5 disc collection. This being the case, why include the original theatrical version at all, when the space could have been used for optimal sound? The extras are excellent though, with pop up facts and a very interesting featurette on Oliver Reed.
B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy, named after nuclear bomb testings, was a very influential underground band that lasted from '87-'89. Jesse Michaels, Tim \\"Lint\\" Armstrong, Matt \\"McCall\\" Freeman, and Dave Mello were the line up. What made Op Ivy different from other bands was they combined punk and ska for the first time to make a different genre. They started getting a lot of attention which eventually led to their break up.  <br /> <br />\\"Bombshell\\" is a short, get up and dance type song. It has a cool bass line. \\"Gonna Find You\\" really speaks to me. The lyrics are powerful, here's just a couple lines: <br /> <br />Saw a civilization where grabbing onto wealth <br />Was the only guarantee of freedom peace and health <br />Dollar sign value system upheld as the truth <br />And if you cant find a place its gonna find you <br /> <br />Saw the paranoid response to all of the examples <br />Of the ones that dont fit in this way of living geting trampled <br />Success is obedience to a structured way of life <br />You cant ignore the structure because were all within its sight <br /> <br />\\"Smiling\\" is about peer pressure to hook up with chicks, \\"Hoboken\\" is about a failing relationship, \\"Artificial Life,\\" is about music that doesn't mean anything, and \\"Yelling in My Ear\\" is a big eff you to control freaks. These are just an example of the songs on the record, it's all really good. I haven't heard a CD in a long time that doesn't have any bad songs on it. I can listen to it without having to push the skip button. It's definitely worth the money, the lyrics are great, the music's great, it's the whole package.
B000002LCB|2.0|I bought this because I loved the movie and alot of Knopfler's guitar work in it.  What I didn't failed to remember is that 90% of the movie contained strange fantasy keyboard sounds accompanying the scenes...and so that's what 90% of this soundtrack is.  It fits with the movie, but for my tastes, not as music to listen to independently.  I guess it's not bad, I just bought it for Knofler's guitar work and there simply isn't alot of it.
B000002GYG|5.0|This is Tom Waits best album. I personally like his later work better myself on a whole, but this early offering from 1975, remains to be my above all favorite. The reason I think, is because it's the real Tom Waits. What I mean by this, is that, as a poet/writer, sometimes I think that the guy takes a lot of different angles and themes to make up his songs. On Nighthawks, you get Tom Waits being Tom Waits. Playing live for a small and intimate crowd. The material on this album really hits it home for me. Not overly complex, jazzy, beatnick type stuff. Low volume.<br /><br />I own this on an old double LP, but format isn't very important. I always listen to this one around 3am when I'm the only one awake. Low decible volume does justice here. I love the raspy talk up sessions he puts on between songs. \\"I've had some scary patty melts at Norms... some prevocative veal cutlets at the Copper Penny, where what you get is a salsbury steak, in the shake and bake, with a lovely sauce made of velveeta and half&half, then smothered in Campbells tomato soup...\\"<br /><br />Kicked off with the Emotional Weather Report, where he claims that \\"things are tough all over...\\" the theme always surrounds the people that I've always known and loved. The Nighthawks. The Last call, last game of 8-ball crowd. A perfect album. Mellow stuff, not a second is wasted on my ears.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I think this is one of Borgart's best performance. Gritty and great.
B000002P74|5.0|If you don't own any Skynyrd yet, get Pronounced, their first album. If you already have Pronounced and are looking to take the second step, than you're in the right place.<br /><br />SECOND HELPING, oh yes. They don't skimp the second time around. When your first album is nothing less than a masterpeice, it's difficult to create a worthy no. 2, no doubt, but these guys (playing by their own rules) pulled it off without a hitch. Heres the breakdown.<br /><br />SWEET HOME ALABAMA: Since the greatest album opener ever was I Ain't the One, they needed something new. How about their biggest single ever? Sure. As over played as this song is, it never gets old. Opening with the same \\"Ah, one two three four\\" as I ain't the one, you know you ain't drifting to far from home. Big wheel keep on turning, man.<br /><br />I NEED YOU: Epic rock ballad, nuff said.<br /><br />DONT ASK ME NO QUESTIONS: Words that you'd like to say to everyone at some point or another. Good bluesy skynyrd.<br /><br />WORKIN' FOR MCA: Yeah, when I first went out and got this CD I remember looking at the back and thinking \\"They wrote a song about their record label?\\" It almost turned me off to buying the thing at all. I'm glad I did though, the song still rocks, and the lyrics are more personal than you think. It's not just some lame commercialization.<br /><br />CURTIS LOEW: The reason 2 ain't 1 is probably cuz' there ain't no face melter like free bird, instead a wicked acoustic slow burner like this. A whole new undertone but a great song for sittin on the ole back porch.<br /><br />SWAMP MUSIC: This starts the one two three finale PUNCH of the album. ROCK.<br /><br />NEEDLE AND THE SPOON: My favorite song on this record. ROCK ROCK<br /><br />CALL ME THE BREEZE: No wait, this is my favorite. ROCK X 3! I LOVE THOSE GEORGIA PEACHES!<br /><br />Don't think twice about Second Helping.<br /><br />OH! By the way, the bonus tracks on this one DONT SUCK! Especially WAS I RIGHT OR WRONG which is so good it sends shivers down my back. I almost forgot that those are included now.  What are you waiting for?G which is so good it sends shivers down my back. I almost forgot that those are included now.  What are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth's continued evolution and innovation is truly a breath of fresh air in a music industry saturated with formulaic trend-seekers. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" proves that Opeth has not forgotten any of their previous albums, and has successfully added a new layer to their already-refined sound.  <br /> <br />\\"Ghost of Peridition\\" opens the album, and immediately establishes that this will not be another \\"Damnation\\". No... you'll find shades of Blackwater Park and Morningrise here. Dual guitars and death vocals dominating most of the song with brief transitions to soft interludes - you know it well and you love it. The lyrics here have more of a progressive feel to them than most Opeth songs. I heard a definite, but subtle, Tool influence while listening to this track (e.g.: around the 2 minute mark), providing a welcome addition. <br /> <br />\\"Baying of the Hounds\\", the second track, is my personal favorite on the album. New member, keyboardist Per Wiberg, is on display here. Fortunately, he meshes fairly well with the rest of the band members - complimenting them rather than overlapping. The song structure reminds me somewhat of \\"Godhead's Lament\\", and is one of the heavier songs on the album. The transitions here are truly remarkable - how anyone can criticize them is beyond me. I feel that Opeth has virtually perfected the art. The descriptive opening lyrics are absolutely vicious and dark - Opeth certainly hasn't lost its trademark doom and gloom. The dual guitar work also has to be mentioned - dare I say that Iron Maiden would be humbled by it? I think so. Akerfeldt breaks the late soft interlude with \\"And I embrace bereavement... I would devote myself to anyone, I would accept any flaws...\\" in his deathly growl, as the guitars rapidly crescendo into a climax. Awesome.  <br /> <br />\\"Beneath the Mire\\" is a rare misfire, and an erratic song at best. The opening takes the emphasis off the guitars and doesn't sound on-par with the rest of the album. Things finally pick uparound the 2:00 mark, but settle back down about a minute later. Overall, this sounds like a 10+ minute song that was crammed into an 8 minute one, and seems very scattered as a result. Putting things in perspective though, \\"Beneath the Mire\\" still sounds better than most metal songs you typically hear on the radio.  <br /> <br />\\"Atonement\\" shifts us back to \\"Damnation\\". Akerfeldt uses a more confident \\"soft voice\\", reminds us of Pink Floyd in some parts, and puts his vocal range to the test. He occasionally shares the spotlight with Wiberg, or a very meandering electric guitar. There's a very consistent undercurrent for the entirety of the song, highlighted by a pulsating guitar rhythm, light piano, and soft drumming that's comparable to Filter (of all bands). It's all very trance'ish, psychedelic, and is probably the closest thing to a \\"happy\\" song from Opeth that we'll ever get. After the 1-2-3 punch that starts the album with growls and guitars ablaze, this is a nice breath of fresh air.  <br /> <br />\\"Reverie / Harlequin Forest\\" follows the same pattern as the first two tracks. Starts off with a few minutes of fire, slows down, builds up, gets loud again - Opeth fans know this drill by now. The most noteworthy thing about the track is the effective and gradual build-up that dominates most of it. Although I'm no expert on the technical aspects of music, the drumming in this one seems worth a mention. My single complaint is that so much time is spent building up, and then the song simply ends without the explosion of sound that we're accustomed to. Maybe it's better that way though, since it leads right into the next track... <br /> <br />\\"Hours of Wealth\\", which for the first half bears much of the psychedelic feel found in \\"Atonement\\" and songs like \\"Windowpane\\" off of Damnation. Some very cool keyboarding wanders in, at least untill the second half of the song kicks in and shifts gears. In this, Akerfeldt (sounding incredibly morose) sings about days passingby and being left in the darkness. Soft and introspective guitars compliment him and end the track. A very good song, but you almost feel like listening to it brings you down. <br /> <br />\\"The Grand Conjuration\\" is the first single off the album, and rightfully so. Fantasy-themed (for lack of a better term) lyrics reemerge. It sounds pretty straightforward compared to the other heavy tracks, but it's also undeniably heavy and dark. The brutal assault that begins at around the 4:15 mark is a definite high point - possibly the heaviest one minute sequence of Opeth to date.  <br /> <br />\\"Isolation Years\\" finishes Ghost Reveries, making the final tally of hard-to-soft tracks a five-to-three split. A woman spends her years in isolation, as evidenced by a letter that leaks the details - all sung by Akerfeldt. Who better to guide us through such a somber path? His voice is beautifully dreary, and his talent cannot be denied. It's hard to believe this is the same person that exhibited such a deathly roar in the track preceding this one.  <br /> <br />That concludes my breakdown of all the tracks found on \\"Ghost Reveries\\". As you have probably already guessed by now, I think it's a fantastic album that any and every Opeth fan should own. They are one of the few bands that manages to progress and evolve, without a decrease in quality or abandoning of their roots. Ghost Reveries will likely satisfy fans of Damnation, Blackwater Park, and everything that came before it. \\"Reveries\\" is akin to Tool's \\"Lateralus\\", in both smooth transition and continued evolution. I've had a little while to digest the album, and I can't give it anything less than five stars. Perhaps with the move to the Roadrunner record label, Opeth will finally get the recognition they deserve.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is just a fantastic cd if your into progressive rock.Alot of long jams and spacey tunes which will remine you of pink floyd,but not a exact copy.Buy it.
B000AADYYO|3.0|This is a mediocre cd compared to Opeth's other cds.  Compared to the new music coming out these days it is definitely 5 stars.  Opeth fans are reading Opeth reviews so I'll say 3 stars.
0553573403|4.0|I was unable to relaxed until I finished this book.  I start staring at it evrytime I had to put it down to do something else.  The book's characters and story pulls you right in the action.  Just forcing you to wish you were in the thick of things experiencing the same things they were feeling.  You sympathize and you hate the characters.  A great book does that.  It gets you involved by allowing you to put, hmm...dream, of being 1 of the characters.  The action, the flow of the story makes you want to read more until you finally get to the next page.  And then.........you wanna read more.  I can't wait to read the next books for this series.  Get 1 for yourself.  It's will definitely be worth your while.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is one of the saddest albums I have ever heard, yet also one of the most beautiful.  I absolutely recommend it as it deals with Beck's despair by putting it out on display for us to see.  Truly heart-wrenching and devestating.
6302212529|5.0|If you are a fanatic of Disney's films, you have to have this masterpiece as part of your collection definitively. The Little Mermaid is simply enchanting. The songs, the characters and Ariel's beauty are going to captive you. <br />If you don't want to miss the BEST of Disney's animated movies, you must have The Gracious Little Mermaid.
6304836619|5.0|Two great stars of the 20th Century combine in this classic whodunnit which might more correctly be termed a who-exactly-done-what-to-whom-and-when? Stage and screen legend, Laurence Olivier, and Michael Caine perform an intricate pas de deu which at all times engrosses while being witty as well as devilishly clever. Highly recommended viewing.
1857989384|5.0|I read the book for the first time in High School and I have continued to read it at least once a year ever since. I am not normally much of a science fiction fan but this book really makes you think. What if it were true?! Once you get into it, I'd be willing to bet you cannot put it down!
0312995423|5.0|Digital Fortress was an excellent book, probably the best I've read all year. This was the first of Dan Browns books I had read, and I was amazed... His writing style was just unmatched. He must have researched the NSA and it's workings for years. Once you start, you can't stop, there is always some new twist you never would have expected. I highly recommend this book, especially to the more technologically aware people.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|SOAD is definitly an acquired taste, the first few times I heard their first album I didn't like it, too frantic and random but my friend was really into them so I ended up hearing it a lot. Pretty soon it started to really grow on me and now I love it, it's so refreshingly different. <br /> <br />While I'd agree with others that it would have been nice if Serj was more prominent as in the previous albums this is never the less a great album. If you liked their others chances are you'll like this too. If you're new to the band, give one of the singles a few listens.
B00005B36H|4.0|I'd heard a few of the songs on the radio and thought I'd give the CD a try.  Good, strong music; I'll probably buy more of their work later on.
6305127646|3.0|Noyce is an extremely good director. He usually likes to dare the viewer with hard and challenging scripts(Henry and June, for instance) but somehow he failed in this case with this misfired character of the main character. The storyboard and the actor direction became the Saint in almost a cartoon network.<br /><br />So, if the true purpose was simply to delight the young audience, the goal was made. But for the mature viewer, this film was a crossroad between the Avengers and 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. Thre was chemistry sexual among Elizabeth Shue and Val Kilmer, but the whole structure of the plot does not resist a further analysis, the script possesses an extreme weakness, fragility and predictability.<br /><br />It's hard to believe Noyce had directed one of the most relevant films in the decade as Patriot Games was, compared with this easily forgettable film that may work out for a boring pop corned rainy weekend.
0345440900|5.0|I cannot praise this book enough. I had no help and was doing it all wrong for 3 months, setting myself up for failure.  I was letting my child sleep in a swing all day and with a feeding at night. If I had not read this book right at the 3 month mark, I would have been in for a world of hurt. My son did not know how to put himself to sleep, something I didn't even know should be done. The EASY system that she describes is the best way to raise your child without using harsh, \\"cry-it-out\\" tactics. I love her and her book, and will be forever grateful.
B000002UB3|5.0|This work remains by far among the loftiest of the whole collection of the Liverpool' s boys (and perhaps the best of all them). If you analyze carefully, this album finds Beatles in a colossal leap, an undeniable musical progress.<br />Starting by the lyrics, the conciseness of the themes, its various motives, the full sense of inspiration and happy mood of all the ensemble.<br />Here comes the sun is a gentle summer breeze, stylized and filled of inspiration all the way.<br />What can it be said from Oh darling?. A true tour de force, with a vibrating guitar and ravishing approach to the \\"white blues\\", a surpassed test thinking about the genial voice of the bad white guy of the blues; his majesty: Eric Burdon.<br />Something is one the finest and sublime ballads written anytime.<br />Come together is an amazing track. The originality and innovative freshness, the blended cross between the different instruments and the assertive vocal support makes of this theme one of the best of the group.<br />Because, is to my mind, one the most complete and mature songs of the Beatles. Its formal construction, is much more complicated than Yesterday; perhaps it' s not so easy going song as this last one, but its strong autumnal character is a farewell hymn for the future. All the world knew about the intense problems lived by all of them, at least that was my reading when I listened this historic record in the early seventies.<br />In last instance, the whole work has not aged a bit. It contains that genius touch, so typical of the great albums: that invisible difference that makes the difference.<br />LONG LONG LIFE, ABBEY ROAD!<br /><br />Pd. It is not a mere casualty this is the best seller album in Amazon (Check the ranking sale)
B000AADYYO|5.0|This is the album Opeth fans have been waiting for.  Once again, the ambitious Swedes are pushing against the frail edges of extreme metal, creating a sound that is both beautiful and violent.  Deliverance and Damnation were both excellent albums, but I believe Ghost Reveries is the ultimate realization that transpired from their previous stellar effort.<br /><br />The record kicks off with a few seconds of tranquil strings, then launches into a brutalizing vocal assault.  Akerfeldt demonstrates why many believe he has the best voice in metal... the clean vox are more impressive than ever, while the death vox rip from his larnyx with unbelievable perfection.<br /><br />The songs progress from here, each displaying stunning musicianship and technicality.  While there is nothing truly new to be had, Opeth takes their tried and true formula and elevates it to the next level.  This is easily one of this year's best music offerings, period.<br /><br />Standout tracks are \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\", \\"Atonemnt\\", \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" and \\"The Grand Conjuration\\".
B00064WSN2|5.0|1970's \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" has been noted to be the second part to their debut by many fans. But, if the debut was so great which I and millions of others do, then wouldn't that be a good thing?  <br />     To me the album has everything, slow and beautiful songs(the Peace themes, Cadence and Cascade) the harder ones(In the Wake of Poseidon, Pictures of a City) and the darkest piece of music I have ever heard EVER (The Devil's Triangle). <br />     There is one thing though. The song \\"Cat Food\\" to me seems to off-balance the whole album. I personally would have released \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" as the single, because, god forbid, if \\"Cat Food\\" was the first Crimson song I would have heard, I would have avoided the band. That song is not what Crimson is all about, but the rest of the album far surpasses it. <br />This is an extremely rewarding album to listen to.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is totally different than any kind of film I have  ever seen before. It truly is a cross between Monty Python and Tommy Boy. Many people hate it when a passion. I can understand that. It's not that kind of humor that many people like. My parents do not get it at all. However, all my friends think it is the one of the best comedies ever made. This is much like Easy Rider. I think it is one of the most pointless movies ever made, but I also did not live through the 60's so the whole point of the movie was lost on me. For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better). I would say if your over 30, it's very unlikely that you will like ND, but give it a try, you might like it. If you don't like it don't bad mouth it, it just wasn't ment for you.
B00030590I|4.0|Though Hero is less than two hours long, it feels like a sweeping epic.  Maybe that's because of the brilliant cinematography, the engaging set pieces, the surprisingly emotional performances, and twisty storytelling that propels the film.  Jet Li, who it is great to see in a film of this type without a hip-hop soundtrack or a team-up with DMX, plays Nameless: a mysterious warrior claiming to have defeated three warriors who had intended to assassinate the reigning King of Qin.  As the story unfolds, twists are abound, as Nameless recalls the events, and the King gives his own interpretation.  The fight scenes are exceptionally done, even though there are plenty who will find them redundant, overdone, and possibly even drawn out or boring.  Hero isn't a film for pure action junkies who love American Jet Li flicks like Kiss of the Dragon or Romeo Must Die, but it would do them well to see this and keep an open mind.  Beautifully executed, Hero is a smash.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Most of the reviews by movie critics horribly misrepresent this movie. Forget the violence or the octopus talk. There's one reason to see this movie. See it for the shocking solution to the question of why this man was locked up for 15 years. This is the kind of \\"twist ending\\" that M.Night Shaymalan wishes he could think of. If you really want to enjoy the ending just go watch the movie knowing as little about it as possible and prepare for your jaw to drop to the floor.
B00008PX8P|5.0|From beginning to end...every song...a utter gem. LZ was at the top of their game for these performances. No Talk -- Just Music! A comparison with \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is dramatic in the extreme. TSRTS is uninspired and tiresome...this compilation brings tears to the eyes of anyone with R&R in their blood.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|This is too much like \\"The Matrix\\". For the first half hour, it was making me mad. All the same effects and even in same locations. Although some of the good/evil approaches were actually thought provoking, it wasn't really new. Not bad for a filler, but not a main event.
0895260131|5.0|Excellent account of what Islam really is and what we are in for. <br />Should be mandatory reading, starting in High School.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Star Trek First Contact is by far the best Star Trek movie.  Since the movie is featuring the Borg, it can't go wrong.  The excellent storyline, wonderful acting, and the special effects are what set this movie apart. <br /> <br />    The story includes some time-travel and explains the origin of warp drive.  I will not go into further details as I might ruin it for someone. <br /> <br />    The acting (for the most part) is great.  Patrick Stewart delivers a stunning performance along with the other main characters, except the doctor.  She still remains as one of the worst actors out there, but does a slightly better job than in the show. Another great performance was by the borg queen.  She acted the part perfectly as the leader of the borg.  <br /> <br />    The special effects are quite capable of making you believe that the Enterprise and the borg are real.  The space battles are stunning and fun to watch.   <br /> <br />   First Contact is the best Star Trek movie out there.  Everything about it is great (especially the creepy borg), so if you haven't seen it; be sure to soon.
B00008URYM|5.0|I'm not gonna talk about this song,if you're a huge fan of madonna's just like me,then just buy this single. <br /> <br />As far as I know,AMERICAN LIFE(single) is released 4 versions(more?),the other 3 are: <br />REMIXES CD:included 5 remixes+1 remix of DIE ANOTHER DAY,but no Radio Edit <br />PART 1:Radio Edit+2 remixes(Missy Elliott+Peter Rauhofer's American Anthem Part1) <br />PART 2(Blue):Radio Edit+2 remixes(Oakenfold Downtempo remix+Felix Da Housecat's Devin Dazzle Club mix) <br />And you can find the 4 reimxes in PART 1 & PART 2 also available on the REMIXES CD. <br /> <br />So the best way to own complete AMERICAN LIFE collection is get the REMIXES CD 'n this one,then you would get all the remixes and also the radio edit(though it's just little different from the album version),and plus a exclusive Remix of DIE ANOTHER DAY which you can't find on any other CDs. <br /> <br />Don't waste money on the other two 3-trk-singles,thought there are just 2 tracks on this single, it's worth.
0895260131|4.0|This book reveals the agenda of Islam to subjugate the entire world.  The point is that there is no radical Islam.  All true believers intend to enslave all who are not followers.  The picture painted is very dark and leaves one with the feeling that we must defeat all Moslems except those who sunscribe to a reformed Islamic faith.  I really liked the book and felt that I have a better understanding of why someone would blow themsleves up along with many innocent people.  I now see the need to fight our war on terrorism to the end.
0385338082|5.0|I stayed up all night reading Can You Keep a Secret. So did my sister. I've recommended it to countless friends.  It's a great bit of chic lit with a few twists.  Kudos to Sophie Kinsella on a well-written, fun story perfect for a weekend at the beach or a rainy day.  Enjoy!
B000AADYYO|5.0|I've been a fan of Opeth since I bought their Blackwater Park album.  It's one of my favorites, but not one of their best pieces.  Ever since then, I've bought some of their older CDs and I've fallen in love with their music.  The songs are beautiful and I truly think they are all a work of art. <br /> <br />I was shocked with Deliverance(their heaviest) and then shocked once more with the release of Damnation(their softest).  Damnation was hard to get use to, but I realized that not many respectable Death Metal bands could bridge the gap like that and make it exceptional.  For those of you who are new, Damnation was an experiment, if you will.  Any other album you pick up is full of harsh vocals, punishing guitar riffs, and long songs(10+ minutes, is an average)    <br /> <br />Anyways, Ghost Reveries just shocked me again.  I like how they've added clean vocals to the heavy music, it truly adds depth.  You'll have to listen to this to understand how great of a CD this is.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone who loves Opeth or loves Death Metal in general. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060090367|5.0|A nice introduction to the quirky, eccentric yet lovable, warm Walsh Family.

And thats where it gets interesting as Claire is no longer who she is before.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|In the midst of a rising number of superhero/comicbook films, \\"Batman Begins\\" stands as a mark against which all others should be measured from here on. Until I saw this film this summer, I said as much about both Spider-Man movies. Sam Rami's take on Peter Parker focuses on his character as much, if not more, than on his powers and daring deeds. Yet both S-1 and S-2 nearly fell into the same trap created by the earlier Superman and Batman films in that we got more about the villians than the main characters. <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is a great movie, period. You can enjoy it if you've never seen another Batman film, or another superhero film for that matter, or even if you've never read a single issue of the comic. It may start a bit slow, showing Bruce Wayne's evolution into the Batman, but every second of screen time devoted to it is necessary to the story and allows even those well versed in the character to see and understand this tortured man's evolution into the avenging Dark Knight. And it is the most faithful redition yet of the character as he has been presented by Bob Kane, Dennis O'Neil and Neil Adams, and Frank Miller. <br /> <br />Drawing inspiration from all of the above, the screenplay by Chris Nolan and David Goyer is tight and emotion-packed as well as filled with marvelous action pieces. Their Batman is indeed a \\"creature of the night...black...terrible....\\" Several moments during the Batman's first appearance will make you jump as if you're watching a tense thriller or horror film. And Christian Bale's performance nails the character from every angle. There a subtlties in his portrayal--body language, expression--that in some scenes project far more than any amount of dialoue could. He carries off Bruce's numerous emotional states, as well as his facade as the \\"millionaire playboy\\" in a way that no previous actor ever has. The highest compliment I can give him is to say his presentation of the dual character Bruce Wayne/Batman ranks on par with Christopher Reeve's rendition of Clark Kent/Superman in \\"Superman, the Movie.\\" <br /> <br />As for the supporting cast, I never thought anyone could replace Michael Gough as Alfred from the Burton films, but I shouldn't have worried. Though Michael Caine looks nothing like the comic's portrayal of the faithful Wayne butler, he brings off the part with the perfection I've come to expect in Caine's performances. <br /> <br />The big surprise to me was Gary Oldman. I've known for years that the man was an absolute chameleon of an actor, but his casting as the young Jim Gordan also raised some doubts. Until I saw the film. His Gordon is perfect. He looks, acts and sounds like Jim Gordan should. No one has ever played this character better, and it's my sincere hope that the next film(s) explore the relationship between him and Batman. <br /> <br />As for the villians and the lead actress, here is where my only quibble with the film appears, and it's certainly not enough to eliminate a star from my rating. Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes are all marvelous in their respective parts; however, \\"Batman Begins\\" continues the tradition of the \\"two-villian+love-interest\\" motif that now plague the superhero film genre. While not nearly as much time is devoted to their storylines or the relationship between childhood friends Bruce and Rachel Dawes, the fact that they are present gave me an, \\"Ugh, here we go again\\" moment. Without giving anything away, the next film needs to devote its plot to Batman versus a single nemisis just as the original Burton film did. And this time leave the girl out of it. Bruce may have plenty of arm-candy as Gotham's most eligible bachelor, but as in the comics, they should be only that. He shouldn't be close to, and certainly shouldn't wind up in bed with, ANY of them. Fortunately in this film the closest we get to any kind of sex between Rachel and Bruce is a somewhat chliched film-ending kiss, something that made me voice a very relieved \\"whew!\\" <br /> <br />This is by far the best Batman film ever made. It may even be the best superhero film ever made. I'll need to see it a few more time before I decide, but now that it's coming out on DVD, I'll be able to do just that!
0440241413|5.0|I bought this book together with `Shopaholic Takes Manhanttan` at the Narita Airport to kill time on the flight. And BOY.. was i very impressed with Ms Kinsella`s debut novel. I believe there`s a little shopaholic in every girl`s heart and i caught myself laughing out loud with Becky`s misadventures in the novel. Although I am definitely not something so extreme like Becky, i could relate to her totally like worrying about a beautiful scarf in the midst of a conference! Ha! At somepoint, Becky could be really stupid & naive in the novel but in the end its her big-heartedness that charms the readers. A job well-done Ms Kinsella! <br />
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, this album has a \\"new\\" indie sound, like a producer's formula. Maybe the band just got really comfortable with their style and sound in the studio (as I think they are), or some other reason... It has a lot of great, solid ideas and a brave, independent feel at moments. Soul Meets Body, Sarah Said, Stable Song, The Names for the Same Thing, Follow You into the Dark... they sound incredible. <br /> <br />This album is sooo good anyway, you WILL enjoy it. But it's not the visceral DCFC a lot of fans adore. This album will get the mainstream crowd. <br />
B000002AGM|4.0|I had heard the album several times before, and I enjoyed it very much.  It helped me build an appreciation for jazz.  I was convinced with Miles' style of music.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys jazz; whether it be Miles Davis or anyone else.  It's great!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I wouldn't even give it a star.  This is unromantic, is gross.  What a dissapointment.  I thought this was a love story but it wasn't at all, this was only about sex & lies.  The only good thing was the acting, that's all.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I own this album, have listened through it completely several times, and honestly, I can't see what the big deal is.  Green Day was a decent band that lived out its heyday during the early 90's punk revival.  Now they are trying to repackage their tired 3 chord tricks in the form of a \\"concept album,\\" with drawn out epic versions of basic Green Day pop diddies, and a few 'sensetive' tracks to grab the attention of the easily swayed MTV crowd.  It's decent for what it is, but I certainly don't think it deserves the ridiculous amount of attention its been getting.  Try listening to a real concept album, like Yes' \\"Close to the Edge,\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"Animals,\\" and then listen to \\"American Idiot\\" and decide for yourself whether Green Day is really as 'ingenius' as they've been made out to be.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|Let me get my kvetching out of the way before I start gushing so much that I make Linda Richman look like a casual Streisand fan.  It's great to have the additonal photographs and a much improved repackaging after the dismal CD packaging that has been in circulation for years now.  As for the DVD extras, the Barbra/Barry interview is a little longer than what was featured on Entertainment Tonight on Aug. 30, 2005.  I would have liked for them to have gone more into a more in depth discussion about the making of Guilty. <br /> <br />Also, when the albums Dusty in Memphis and Pearl were reissued, the record companies opened up the vaults and included bonus tracks.  It would have been interesting to have had some of the discarded songs included here.  Im' guessing that Barbra and Sony are saving those for a package somewhere down the road.  I liked seeing the One Voice performances again.  It's great to see them again.  <br /> <br />Listening to the album again, one can't help but realize that Barry's production and songs served as vehicles to continuously take Barbra's voice soaring into the stratosphere.  The album was the pinnacle of Barbra's pop albums, a foray that did not start off very promisingly with What About Today? Yet, over a decade later, she had the biggest hit of her career when she teamed with Barry for this album.  It still holds up magnificently a quarter of a century later.  <br /> <br />The songs range from the breathtaking Love Inside, to the playful dance oriented tunes Promises and Never Give Up. There is the amazing Woman in Love. How did Barbra NOT win the Grammy for that one??? Jeez!  Guilty is a playful Carribean shuffle between her and Barry and their What Kind of Fool is nothing short of majestic.  Make It Like A Memory should be ranked alongside Eric Clapton's original Layla and MacArthur Park with it's great 3 minute instrumental coda, not to mention some of the bluesiest singing ever from our Barbra.  (That's also a weakness of the track - the coda still isn't as thrilling as Barbra's voice!!!)  Too bad she never closed out a concert with it.  It would have been incredibly dramatic, not to mention serve as a great exit music in lieu of Happy Days (soory for the heresy!)  Fortunately with the technology of today you can play the songs in any order you want and even edit them if that coda really bothers you!  <br /> <br />On the Linda Richman butter scale it's Land O'Lakes all the way!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I enjoyed the character diversity and development, but regret the show was cancelled before the end of the story arc was reached.  Hopefully, the upcoming feature movie will answer some large questions.  Highly recommend.
0316172324|4.0|I think it is a good book to awaken people to the fact that the human being is more of a multi-dimensional creature than we realized. More is going on subliminally than is occuring on the surface. Blink wets your appetite to pay more attention to yourself and others for these subliminal clues as to the Truth of a situation or individual.  I found it fascinating and delightful. It contributes to the delicious mystery of life.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod Stewart at his all time best. Fantastic back up solo musicians. One of the most poignant moments in the concert was when he announced the appearance of Amy Bell: a young lady he found \\"busking\\" on the streets of Glasgow. This was her first professional appearance, decending a grand staircase to the stage of The Old Albert stage to screaming fans to do a duet with the greatest rock and roller of all time! It brought tears to my eyes. I hope as a result we will be able to buy a DVD of Amy in the near future. Fabuluous. <br />Nick
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a perfect movie for all you masochists and sadists out there who can't get enough gore and depravity. The special effects are awesome, but i thought the movie stalled on the lame moral message. Come on, it's been over 2,000 years, get over it!
0140042520|2.0|I don't know, but I didn't get this book. I tried. I wanted to. But...I don't see what the big deal is. My suspicion is, as I hinted above in my jerky little title, people hail this book because they think it makes them somehow elite and cool to proclaim a kinship to it. I think that's the key to the \\"popularity\\" of a lot of art, a lot of music, a lot of literature extolled by subcultures within the masses. They are bolstered by an illusion of affinity for what they secretly do not embrace. In the case of this book, at times Kerouac's prose was lovely and at other times it rambled  until I had no idea what he was going on about. The concept of The Dharma Bums is exciting and if even a fraction of those who claim this novel awakened something spiritual inside them are being honest, then I respect its impact on them, but...I didn't connect with the Beat vocabulary, with the story here, or the fact that since it's probably as much invention as autobiography, it validly inspires aspirations of real life imitation. But then again (as I'm sure so many reading this will gleefully agree) what do I know?
B000AADYYO|5.0|<br /> Ignore the guy who gave the album two stars. He must not be a  <br />true Opeth fan, because he has reviews for rap albums. Opeth's <br />new album is probably in their top three best albums. No, Opeth <br />has not gone mainstream even though they are now on a mainstream <br />record label. Their old record label was a mainstream record company to, so why worry.  <br /> Now, onto the album the lyrics are probably their best. Mikael has more vocal work - both screaming & singing. You can definitely hear the help of Steven Wilson in the vocals. The new <br />keyboard adds a new and darker sound to it, as well as melodic. The last song Isolation Years has a musical sound to it. The new album is definitely not mainstream. Would you compare it with Limp Bizkit or Lincoln Park? Ghost Reverise is the best metal album of the YEAR!
0446364495|2.0|Remember, a review is not necessarily always a description of a book's plot, only a telling of the reviewer's impressions of it after reading. I'm going to skip jotting what this story was about and offer my opinion. Fair enough?<br /><br />Back when this was cruising the top spot on the Times best seller lists I used to hear a lot of jokes made about this book. Mostly these were told by men, men who probably never read this or any other \\"chick book\\" in their lives, so I didn't pay much attention to them. I never let anyone's bad opinion of a book stop me from reading what I want, but I didn't have a lot of interest in TBOMC or get around to it till long after the buzz about this novella (let's not call it a novel, it's not) had subsided. I'd seen the movie version, thought it was decent, and came to this book with a neutral outlook.<br /><br />Now here's my take:<br /><br />This isn't a terrible novel but I'm surprised it got enough word of mouth exposure to make it the record-breaker it was. I think it wasn't the writing that made it well-received, so much as how it touched on the fantasy of so many bored, trapped middle-aged women who would have loved to have had a dashing stranger come into their lives, fall in love with them overnight, and offer them the chance for \\"escape\\". I didn't find Mr. Waller a capable writer, I didn't regard the characters as convincingly cast, I didn't even care what became of any of them. This book was too brief to be boring but it wasn't exciting, either.<br /><br />You know, though, life's short and full of misery, so if this brightened anyone's life ten years ago or does so ten years from now, that's all that should matter about The Bridges of Madison County.
B000063WDH|2.0|Obviously these guys have invested heavily into the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L., Junior Kimbrough et al, via the Fat Possum catalog. Although it is mildly entertaining, why spend your filthy lucre on the imitation stuff when you can have the real deal? Search out the real innovators of this sound, they've been doing it a lot longer (and better) with more soul and authenticity than the boys from Akron.
B00065JTBA|5.0|What an incredible box set... In the beginning I was worried that it would just contain demos, outtakes and what nots of already known and famous songs. But this is not the case. Most of the songs are never heard, never published and many times I had to stop myself and ask - WHY NOT??? <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Garageland\\", \\"Miss 4th of July\\", \\"Open all night\\" or \\"Staring all over again\\" or \\"Last man Standing\\" (to name but a few of those fun, song-packed four CDs) are all more than album worthy. <br /> <br />The 5th disk is a DVD, which is very fun and interesting to watch- Jon and Co talk about the different songs and it definitely helps to round out this wonderful box set. <br /> <br />100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong - sooo true - and again, no fault w/ this set either.  <br /> <br />Bon Jovi have outdone themselves. THANK YOU GUYS!
0790729342|5.0|I watched this movie again last night before writing this review and all I can say is WOW!  I first saw it when I was too young, about 10, and have watched it about 50 times in the last 20 years.  I own it on VHS and DVD, and the quality of both is good.  I could write a book about how great this movie is and how much I love it.  If my house burned down and I could only grab one movie, this would be it.  It is done so well.    I'll discuss the overall merits of the movie. Everybody knows the plot, so I won't discuss that in detail other than to say the plot of the movie is amazing and creative.  It is a compelling social commentary on human nature in times of survival (in times of chaos, some people band together for good and some band together for bad).  We are presented with both, in shades of gray.  For instance, Max is our \\"hero\\" but he is looking out for himself first and foremost and is a reluctant hero in the end.  The introductory narration and concluding narration are creative, add some insight to the movie, and are outstandingly well done.  Next, the casting and acting were first rate and the dialogue is precise and compelling.  Much of what happens isn't explained with dialogue, but instead with shocking facial expressions which are more powerful than words (a few great examples: the Gyro captains facial expression watching a woman be raped, beaten, and killed; the Warrior Woman's expression when she sees people being tortured and burned; and the Feral kid's expression when he sees the two good guys pulled from the tanker and run over and then when the bad guy is shot by Max, and again his fear at being on the hood of a moving semi truck).  Now, if a great creative plot accompanied by first rate acting and casting isn't enough of a reason for 5 stars, add to the mix the following:  This movie boasts not one, but several of the best car chases ever to hit the big screen.  Better than Bullet, Ronan, The Bourne Supremacy, etc.; even as good as or better thanMad Max!  Not only are the car chases phenomenal and creative, but the vehicles are super cool.  Can you think of cooler vehicles than Max's V8, the orange Ford truck with the dart guns mounted on the back, Humugus' truck, and the several other creative muscle cars presented?  And, to go along with the amazing car chases and cars, the stunts are better than ANY MOVIE I'm aware of.  No computer graphics here.  These were true live stuntmen who broke many bones making this movie.  It's crazy good and the action is basically non-stop.  The video angles are great too and we're given the \\"benefit\\" of a view from above by the Gyro pilot.  And the characters are creative, memorable, touching in their own ways, and are developed VERY well in such a short time.  Wez, for instance, is one of the greatest movie villains of all time in his many berserk rages and ruthlessness.  And, add one of the all-time best movie musical scores written by Brian May.  It's really moving and compellingly done and fitting for the movie.  The costuming was very creative and first rate too.   But, with any movie it isn't perfect and after watching it many many times I've noticed a few imperfections.  But the imperfections are petty and don't detract from the movie in any way.  My only complaint is that the extras on the DVD are less than good.  It was done very cheaply.  But I won't hold that against the amazing movie because extras are just that, extras.  And, some of the voices were dubbed and it would be nice to have the original version as well as the dubbed version on the same disc, like what was done with Mad Max (where you are offered the Australian version and the dubbed version).  If you like this movie, I recommend the original Mad Max as a 5 star movie which prequels The Road Warrior.  I do not recommend \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" because it's a very disappointing sequel and I rate it at 2 stars (see that review for more information).
0393316041|5.0|Even though I have a Ph.D. in Physics, I don't know enough about theoretical Physics to have a good judgment on how great a scientist Richard Feynman was, but to judge this book it seems not important whether he got the Nobel price or was just a high school science teacher.  It is his love for solving problems and the humurous way he wrote about it that make this book so interesting.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Plans is another Death Cab album. I'm sure Death Cab fans will love it. Plans pretty much picks up where Transatlanticism left off; Death Cab continues to be a solid indie band, but nothing special.  <br /> <br />Plans is another album that you could pretty much just put into the cd player and forget you ever started. The first song drifts by; the second song, the single, \\"Where Soul Meets Body\\" is pretty uninspired; the album keeps going and it all sort of blends together. The highlights on this album are \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" and \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed.\\"  <br /> <br />Ben Gibbard continues to be the most inconsistant writter in all of indie rock. The man can't decide if he wants to be Shakespeare or just another Emo Stu. It just blows me away that a man can be so strong and deep on some tracks, heck even some verses, and be so weak on others.  <br /> <br />It's hard to tell if Death Cab is past it's prime or just getting started, but it's clear they're getting a bigger follwing and, to be perfectly honest, not changing is probably the safest way to go. If a band this good would take some chances, they could stumble upon a classic. Till then, all they can do is make Plans.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|If you are looking for a movie that can hold your interest for more than a few minutes, then look elsewhere.  This was the most boring movie my wife and I have ever watched.  Sahara is one gun battle/chase after another with a transparent plot and little to no character development to keep your interest.  This movie has been compared to National Treasure and Indiana Jones, but don't believe the hype!
B0002X314C|5.0|Words cannot describe how I feel when I listen to John Legend.  I feel like I know him. I have had the great fortune to see him twice in concert, once in L.A. and once in Seattle both concerts within a span of 6 days. I would have paid thousands, stood in line for months and given up sleep for years just to experience what I did. He speaks to my soul. Literally. He is an absolute gem. Meeting him was just the icing on the huge delicious cake that he provided me during his performance.  He is humble, appreciative, and probably not yet aware of what he does to his audience. I can say with great confidence that he will be a tremendous success, because I, along with hundreds of thousands of others will guarantee it!  My Gifts to all I know this Christmas season...The \\"Get Lifted\\" cd. Without a doubt, everyone should feel this good. I look forward to meeting him and talking with him again!  Now go buy the cd!!
B00005JODA|4.0|Fernando Meirelles (\\"City of God\\")has crafted a intelligent political thriller that isn't without its flaws. First a warning--almost every review here (mine included has some plot spoilers **but** most of these spoilers are points that are revealed fairly early. Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle a mild mannered diplomat driven to action when his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz in a free spirited, powerful performance)a political activist is brutally murdered in Kenya. Quayle goes on a quest to bring those responsible for her murder to justice even though it might endanger his life uncovering a conspiracy that is little more than a \\"marriage of convenience\\". As he strips away the polite, politically correct veneer that surrounds those around him he uncovers a darkness that consumes his friends and may, ultimately, consume him as well.<br /><br />This isn't a simple political thriller like \\"Conspiracy\\". Meirelles film is challenging as it is primarily told in flashback with some puzzling flash forwards towards the end that rob the ending of much of its power. The denouncement could have easily been placed at the end of the film without robbing it of its dramatic conclusion. That minor flaw aside and the fact that a good fifteen minutes needed to be cut from the film and the pacing tightened up a bit, \\"The Constant Gardener\\" will involve you as a filmgoer. You're drawn into Fiennes' marvelous portrayal of Justin although there's just as much mystery at the heart of this man as there is about his wife. Dispelling some of that mystery with a bit more character development would also have helped the film as well; the best political thrillers work when we're drawn into the world of those characters we care about. Whether that character development and background is important will determine if you like this film or not to some extent. Since this is, essentially, told from the point of view (with the exception of a couple of scenes) of one man his lack of knowledge is our lack of knowledge and his discover ours. While the mystery at the heart of this thriller isn't the main point (as it was about a film with a somewhat similar premise \\"The Fugitive\\"), that's a good thing as we, the audience, are clued in and figure out of much of what's going on before Justin does. That can be bad if the pacing lags and it does lag a bit in the middle of the film. The point of the film is as much about Justin discovering who his wife really is and who he is as much as it is about discovering the \\"mystery\\" at the heart of the plot. This isn't atypical of LeCarrie's work (nor is the unusual structure of the film which echoes much of the structure of the novel). It goes back to the old adage; we don't really know anything about anybody do we?<br /><br />Technically challenging and visually stunning, Meirelles film will be an acquired taste for those geared towards more tradtional politial thrillers like \\"The Interpretator\\" or even \\"Conspiracy\\". There's much to like about this film including the fact that Meirelles takes a number of risks with the material and the performerances themselves. If you enjoyed the recent film of \\"The Tailor of Panama\\", you'll enjoy \\"The Constant Gardener\\". If you're looking for a thriller along the lines of the very good film \\"Red Eye\\" you'll probably be disappointed by the film.<br /><br />Corporations are an extension of our culture and who we here beneath the polite, political veneer that we present. Motivation, whether a company or government is good or bad represents the culture that it serves but, more importantly, these same corporations can set the bar for the moral and ethical thing to do. Why do I bring all this up? Because \\"The Constant Gardener\\" like \\"The Parallax View\\" or \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" and like John LeCarrie's Smiley books (and the films adapted from them) represented the way that intelligent political thrillers used to be made. They held someone accountable and they also weren't afraid to play with the conventions of the genre. \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is well worth a look if you're in the mood for something for a challenging thriller.The Constant Gardener\\" is well worth a look if you're in the mood for something for a challenging thriller.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|When you awake it is so dark you can taste it.<br /><br />You swim up through the darkness, struggling fitfully out of sleep, strangling, lungs clotted with the choking darkness, close around you and pressing down on your chest. You struggle out of one nightmare to awake in another: you're not in your own bed. The darkness is total: the stink of death rancid in your nostrils. You're on a cold, wet tile floor, but beyond that you can't see anything, can't find your way in the ink-black dark that covers you. You panic: your breath is fast and ragged, you whimper and cry out.<br /><br />Now: most nightmares are the worst when the lights are out; when the lights come on, you're snug, cuddled beneath the blanket of Normalcy and the Everyday. In \\"Saw\\", the nightmare begins when the lights come on.<br /><br />By now, everyone knows the legendary set-up of the deliciously sick piece of celluloid that is \\"Saw\\": Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, playing a guy named \\"Lawrence\\" if ever there was one) awake chained to pipes across from each other in a filthy industrial utility room. In the middle of this abbatoir lies the corpse of a man, face down in his own blood, a .38 revolver clamped in his dead hand. Their true whereabouts? Unknown. How they came there? Unknown. The someone---or something---that delivered them to such a state?<br /><br />Unknown.<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" might pass itself off as a horror movie, but the fact is that this engine of death and destruction is a flick with more on its mind than splatter. This is a film about Crime and Punishment.<br /><br />In our enlightened age, we kill our killers with lethal injection. Think of that: those who kill children and bury them alive, hack the limbs off antique pensioners, those who scar and murder and rape and mutilate and defile---all of them are sent out of this vale of tears in a state of peaceful, drug-addled slumber. Some of you---myself included---would say this is a travesty: even the Death Penalty in our enfeebled land is hardly a true punishment tailored to the brutalities perpetrated by the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Well, then, rejoice in \\"Saw\\", for the killer---the man, or Creature, or being, or darksome thing that lurks behind the name and mask of the Jigsaw Killer---feels as we do: he is a believer in Justice. He is a believe in the ultimate Talmudic rite: let the Punishment fit the Crime.<br /><br />Dr. Gordon and Adam find their respective instructions, left on a tape muffled and distorted but wickedly clear: they have eight hours. Eight hours to kill the other man, to cut him down like a dog, to find the key, to escape the deathhouse, this charnel sewer. Eight hours: Fail, and for Adam, it is Death. For Dr. Gordon, it is death---and the death of Family as well (Mackenzie Vega and Monica Potter, both carrying their weight admirably).<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" is a brilliant little piece of terror, perfectly economical, remarkably efficient at terrorizing its audience. It is more so for being entirely unpredictable: I found \\"Saw\\" to be the cinematic equivalent of drinking Scotch on the porch, outside, on a summer night: lifting the tumbler to your lips, only to find your mouth millimeters away from a fat, bloated, dying Black Widow spider, contorted with her death throes, larger than a piece of ice, floating, seething, dying in your drink.<br /><br />I have never seen a film---outside \\"The Blair Witch Project\\"---so dependent on light and dark to evoke a mood. I have never seen a film so entirely capable and competent at conjuring up a mood of isolation, of wicked machination, of brutal death, solely by its use of light and dark. \\"Saw\\" immerses you in a charnel house sunk deep within the ground, well stocked with clues---indeed, whatever you think of this monster called the Jigsaw Killer, you must at least acknowledge his willingness to provide his victims with the means to their salvation.<br /><br />Watch \\"Saw\\" in the dark, all the lights off, preferably with a storm howling and pounding outside the window. For \\"Saw\\" is only slightly a serial killer movie: it tips its hat to \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", but its dark, wicked, brutal art is born from far more truly from the monster movie. \\"Saw\\" is about a monster: a creature that crawls, writhes, plots, engineers, from the shadows.<br /><br />Director James Wan has pulled off what, by my lights, is the perfect horror movie: compactly edited, brutally effective, happy to spill blood in the service of its message, consumingly efficient and economic. If there is a scarier device in cinema than a puppet rolled out on a tricycle to gibber in the dark, I have yet to see it. Wan and Director of Photography David Armstrong use dark and light to evoke claustrophobia, fear's aphrodisiac, and spike the mixture with psychedelic images of horror and death.<br /><br />The acting throughout is solid and compelling. Much has been said about Elwes's overracting---but as you watch \\"Saw\\", you realize this is a film about surfaces, and the darkness, and lies, and deception that lies beneath. Yes, Dr. Gordon is over the top---and he has a reason to be. Elwes and Whannel carry their roles like champs, right down to the point where those rusty hacksaws become one-way tickets to the bright land of Normalcy.

For \\"Saw\\" is only slightly a serial killer movie: it tips its hat to \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", but its dark, wicked, brutal art is born from far more truly from the monster movie. \\"Saw\\" is about a monster: a creature that crawls, writhes, plots, engineers, from the shadows.  <br /> <br />Director James Wan has pulled off what, by my lights, is the perfect horror movie: compactly edited, brutally effective, happy to spill blood in the service of its message, consumingly efficient and economic. If there is a scarier device in cinema than a puppet rolled out on a tricycle to gibber in the dark, I have yet to see it. Wan and Director of Photography David Armstrong use dark and light to evoke claustrophobia, fear's aphrodisiac, and spike the mixture with psychedelic images of horror and death.  <br /> <br />The acting throughout is solid and compelling. Much has been said about Elwes's overracting---but as you watch \\"Saw\\", you realize this is a film about surfaces, and the darkness, and lies, and deception that lies beneath. Yes, Dr. Gordon is over the top---and he has a reason to be. Elwes and Whannel carry their roles like champs, right down to the point where those rusty hacksaws become one-way tickets to the bright land of Normalcy.

B0009X766Y|5.0|I'm sure that many people thought that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were unlikely to be as successful a second time as they were in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID . <br /> <br />This film proves them wrong - all they need is a great script , fine supporting players who are allowed their own moments in the spotlight and a good director .   <br /> <br />This film is about gambling - gambling with your life over proving a point to someone who did the wrong thing by one of your friends . <br /> <br />The way the story unfolds is pure magic and is incredibly entertaining . <br /> <br />I never tire of this great film - it communicates strongly and leaves you on a high .  <br />Some of those films considered the greatest are not necessarily the ones with a high replay factor . This film will continue to enchant generations to come . <br />Watch it and see the best do what they do best .
B0007P3582|4.0|Man, i expected more because his first album was ALL HITS! but this one had many highlights as well, most notably \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\". Basically The Only Songs that are skippable are \\"This Is 50\\", \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\", \\"Gunz Come Out\\", \\"My Toy Soldier\\", and \\"I Dont Need em\\". THe rest are SOLID, this album is worth it, good job 50. GGGGUNIT!
1558216847|5.0|Having worked in Russia for many years I found this to be an outstanding book. The history and situations that many have had to encounter at the hands of the former Russian government is very well written in this book. The Long Walk is a book that is difficult to put down and is a very unique and strong story. Highly recommend this book.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|I had seen movie trailers for this at the theatres, but had thought nothing of it.  Now, I wish I had been able to see this one on the big screen because it was so great!  This movie has a little bit of everything: comedy, horror, drama, action, suspense, musical, and originiality.  Terrific tongue and cheek humor, and the soundtrack is awesome!  A real winner and I recommend it to everyone I know, even the ones that don't like scary movies.  5 stars!
B00005JNSK|5.0|I saw the previews and I honestly did not think I would like this film.  I have not been a big fan of most of Burton's films except for 'big fish'.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the film's willingness for Wonka to be creepy and weird, yet the way Depp plays him it is hilarious.  The film is a feast of colorful settings and imagination gone wild.  Other than Charlie, the other children are nasty and hateful and their unfortunate demises are satisfying and fun to watch.  However there is nothing violent in their respective comeuppances and the entire film is more than appropriate for the entire family.  There are no curses, no sexual overtures, nothing that would make a parent squirm while sitting next to their chidlren.  It also manages to bring more of a foundation to the story with background info on how Wonka found the Ooompa's and his fascination with chocolate.  If fact the films ends quite warmly with a focus on not only the family but the value of the family as well.  A very nice film and much more enjoyable than the original, but then I never like the original.  If you take the children, they will love it.  I took four and the entrie lot just loved it.  They can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This band made me rethink rock music .  The eye catching cover makes you wonder what the music could possibly be like . The album explodes into the first song and the band is in charge from then on .    The lyrics are way out there , but suit the music well .  It is an ambitious album which largely succeeds .  The band are quite different and they create worlds in which the songs exist .    I would ask that prospective listeners take a chance after listening to excerpts of the tunes - some are very heavy in tone , others are like lullabies . This is a record of opposites .   If you would like to broaden your taste , start here .
B00000255F|5.0|Bruce Springsteen Doesnt deserve this. And this album in particular. There is no other album as epic as this one. Every song is a masterpiece. You should not go through life without hearing the title song and \\"Thunder Road\\". One thing that bugs the heck out of me is its down to 4.5 stars due to all the ignorant people who review Bruce's political views. You people forgot this is a free country? You people reviewing his political views are just as ignorant sounding as those people you claim are \\"Anti-American\\". How is Bruce anti-american exactly? Just because he disagrees with Goerge Bush's actions doesnt make him a criminal or anything. It's ok, it's free country. Say anything you want about the president and the war on Iraq. Unfortuantly you ignorant people dont realize this. That's why people out there in other countries look at america as evil.<br /><br />As far as this album and the MUSIC. This album is just fantastic. I am dissapointed to see this album going from 5 stars - where it should be - to 4.5 stars. If you Bruce fans agree with me, show it by clicking on the Helpful button. So we finally can get the review back to 5 stars.
0790740443|4.0|Soldier was a film that I didn't particularly want to see but now it's one of my favorites.  Everytime I watch I get more out of it.  Kurt Russell is perfect for Todd.  He's a man who was chosen at birth to be a \\"Soldier\\".  Soliders are trained to only speak when spoken to by an officer first, to show no emotion, no mercy, and follow orders with very little room for thinking. <br /> <br />Then a newer, genetically engineered soldier is introduced and the group that Todd fought with is demoted to go-fers for the 'real' soldiers.  Todd, who was used to test the ability of the 'new' models was injured, rendered unconscious and put out with a garbage run. <br /> <br />It's at this point that the movie really takes off.  Todd is helped by settlers who are where they shouldn't be.  He has no training in how to react among 'normal' people.  There are families here. You can see that he's trying to figure out the parameters of this new existence and if he hadn't been a sargent and allowed some degree of thinking for himself I don't know if Todd could have coped with these changed circumstances.  There's a lot to think about in this film.  What makes us who we are? If we are trained to act one way and punished for any deviation can we change our patterns of behavior as an adult.  What are the possibilities that people can change.  Whe are the monsters? The killers or those who send them out?  <br /> <br />The film seems to be your same old/same old but there's a lot worth seeing and thinking about in Soldier.
B000002572|1.0|the only reason it gets 1 star is because amazon does not <br />give you the option of 0 star.

B0007WZWXQ|5.0|Ok.  Maybe not a REAL revolution in the world of metal but hey! We're talking about the fathers of Heavy Metal here.<br /><br />This album has everything from clasic old metal as Revolution or Wheels of fire. Some crazy 'in your face' speed metal in Demonizer and Hellrider. An instant classic ballad, Angel...<br /><br />I would say that Lochness had me troubled in the first place.  I listened to this and thought. What the...? I didn't understand why finish this powerful record with this. But with a few more listens I came to love that song a lot.<br /><br />It seems like they haven't lost anything of their magic. THe last record I really like of them was of course Painkiller. This is the next that should have been.
B0004Z33EG|3.0|No one is likely to give Mr Stallone a Best Actor Oscar .  However, one has to give him credit as a writer and as a person who knows what his audience wants from him in playing certain character types - after all, he's acting to be successful .    The film does make other valid points about returning war veterans, but its main focus is the action angle .    Sly plays off Brian Dennehy (the town policeman) very well and the tension begins to build up early in the piece as a result .    If you are looking for an action film that is not for the kids , then you could do worse than this .  Don't look any deeper into it than you should and you may find you enjoy it .  A film for the guys mainly - with more drama than bloodshed.     Update as of Jan 2010: I have bought the American Blu Ray edition and would like to advise that it is region free. If you are elsewhere in the world, this disc is worth picking up due to the picture quality and the worthwhile supplements on it - it is very good value. The version sold in Australia offers only the film and a different interview with Mr Stallone.
B0009S4IHY|1.0|Kung Fu Hustle is again a wonderful & just plain amazing film from writer/director Stephen Chow. However, this American release by Sony Pictures Classic is horrendous as they censored & edited some scenes heavily in order to make it look perhaps more slap-sticky /or family-friendly.<br /><br />It's an R. Yet the higher ups in the studios think that Americans can't handle a real uncensored release...so they censor and don't tell anyone.<br /><br />This IS censored & edited. Avoid if you don't agree with big studios censoring artists works. Buy if you are a sheep and don't care.<br /><br />Links:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]
B00005YXZH|5.0|As a Wilco fan before this album came out, I followed the drama of its release in various music publications and on the Web.  I had heard that this was a different album from the previous releases and the descriptions of it told me some of what they did but there was no way for me to know how it would really sound.  It supposedly was a \\"concept\\" album that wouldn't appeal to the masses.  At least that is what the corporate suits seemed to be saying.  What they meant was that they thought couldn't make money on it.  This made me even more intrigued because I didn't want a cookie cutter album that matched everything else on the charts (not like any of their other albums fit this description). <br /> <br />I bought Yankee Hotel Foxtrot the day it was released and I have never felt better about a music purchase that I knew so little about beyond the soap opera of making it.  I had maybe heard some live bootleg tracks from it, if that.  Straight out of the case, on first listen, I was a believer.  Most albums take a few listens from me to make a judgement on if I like it.  Not this one.  The sound is not inaccessible, even if it is different.  There is a great flow and the song order is great and, even though there is no real \\"radio single\\" on the album, it doesn't matter.  If I put this album on, I turn it up loud and listen to the layers and intricacies of the pieces that come together into the wonderful whole. <br /> <br />As for the suits, they were right to a point.  This is not an album that will be loved by the masses.  It isn't for everybody.  But really, what album is?  Some have bigger followings than others and some of the smaller followings are more fervent.  I encourage everyone to give this album a chance because if you do like it, you will probably love it.   <br /> <br />And if you already liked Wilco's earlier stuff, you will probably like this album.  But you might not because it is a change.  But it fits into the path of evolution of this band and oh,what a wonderful sound they have become.
B0009RJPC8|5.0|Back to Bedlam <br />James Blunt <br />There is no subtle way to say this: former British Army Captain turned melancholic muso James Blunt's debut album Back to Bedlam has not moved from my CD player since I first listened to his haunting lyrics a fortnight ago.  <br />Judging by the hugely positive global responce he has received from the music world, I have a sneaky feeling I'm not the only person hooked on Blunt. <br />The problem is, it's really hard to say why he is just so good. With a fairly high, somewhat raspy voice, he falls into the British acoustic rock category alongside Cold Play and David Gray. If I were to be cynical, I could say his lyrics err on the side of soppily sentimental, but somehow they are not. Instead, songs like \\"Tears and Rain\\" and \\"Goodbye, My Lover\\" catch a chord deep inside you, as if he has said all you wanted to say, but in a five minute song and not a 300 page tome. <br />It's hard to be critical of an album lovingly crafted, that delivers the right message in the perfect packaging, and which showcases sensitive poetry set to music. Even if this makes Blunt sound a bit naff, Back to Bedlam is definitely not. <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|This is in my opinion the strongest DT record. Not only because musicaly everything is in place as always. But because of the story. And because it has Rudess on board. Not that Moore wasn't good. Sherinian was nice too (maybe too into the fusion mood for me). But Rudess... what a genious.<br /><br />This album is very much driven by it's story. A story of love, hate, jealousy, greed and betrayal.<br /><br />If you like Prog Metal and Dream Theater, I would recommend this one as well as Images and Words for a start.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Rock and roll stars have done silly things over the years and it is not pretty to see them get what they deserve . <br />I will not explain what I mean by that - you have to see the film . Criterion are one of the best DVD studios and are a little more expensive as a result , but this is worth it .  <br /> <br />The Stones played at being demonic and nasty for years and at a concert shown in this documentary , their karma caught up with them .  <br />Mick Jagger likes acting , but his mask slips in this .   <br />The filmmakers sat on the fence a little otherwise the film would never have been released , so it is hard to tell where they stand , if that matters to you . <br /> <br />The film shows how the business of rock works - the high priced lawyers , the boredom of the studio , the travelling and organising .   <br /> <br />It's powerful and exciting - just like the best music . <br />It's also much better than the management - sanctioned airbrushed promos we get nowadays by modern 'rock stars' with their teams of stylists and handlers . <br /> <br />Take a look at the old days - shortly after this , it seems everyone had to start behaving themselves a bit better . <br />Rock on with this great package from Criterion .
B000B5XOSO|5.0|BATMAN RETURNS is the best piece of film work I've ever been witness to. It might be that it's only my personal taste but I don't care. I stand by my statements. When it was first released it got a lot of negative reviews, but just like Hitchcock's VERTIGO, it has garnered second opinions from many critics. This might in turn become Tim Burton's Vertigo. The writing is incredible for it's genre. The characters are so complex and so well played. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is the best to date. She has been quoted in saying that her part as Catwoman was the hardest roll she ever played. That she had to go through the script and meticulously outline what Selina Kyle's state of mind had to be. I have absolutely no idea how she missed a nomination for an Academy Award. Danny Devito does a beautifully gory interpretation of the penguin. Christopher Walken is awesome as the sort of the fun-house version of Donald Trump and I love to hate him. Michael Keaton's Batman isn't shown as much but Keaton still has him nailed. The chemistry created between each character is one thing that makes this movie so amazing. It's the tension between them that creates such realism in a surreal made-up world. Especially in my absolute favorite scene when Bruce and Selina find out who each other's opposite identity really is. It's not a coincidence that Rick James' \\"Super Freak\\" plays in the background. There are a lot of underlying themes in this movie that one can sit and think about. I think the writer was trying to say something about those times and about society. It's hard to put a finger on, but I know it's there. One complaint that most have of this movie is the lack of action. That's what I can warn about is the lack of action. This is like the Soup Opera of all comic book movies, and if all you want is action in your movies than you might as well go blow your head off cuz this world can't make much use of you. Anyway I could go on and on about the greatness of this movie, but I need to get back to MY life. So if you have a thoughtful head on your shoulders watch this movie and if all you like is your action go to K-mart and buy yourself a shinny new rifle.
B000AADYYO|4.0|I've always loved how Opeth are consistently reliable as a band, bringing out new albums regularly, and with regular quality.  Each new album is always better and different in some ways than its predecessor, which is what makes Opeth such a joy to watch grow and evolve as a band.  In my opinion, Ghost Reveries is one of their most complete albums to date.  I wouldn't say it is the best, because I like all their albums for different reasons, but on this album, I feel that they have achieved a great balance between the several different motifs and styles of music that they dabble in.   <br /> <br />There are eight songs on here, making up 67 minutes of music.  Five of these songs (Ghost of Perdition, Beneath the Mire, The Baying of the Hounds, The Grand Conjuration, Reverie/Harlequin Forest) are more or less what we've come to expect from Opeth, with long running times, a combination of clean and harsh vocals, some nice guitar solos, soft interludes, and unpredictable dynamics.  These are all great tracks, that each satisfy the listener in their own way, and among them are some of the best Opeth tracks ever recorded.  The remaining three tracks (Atonement, Hours of Wealth, Isolation Years) are softer, more ballad-like songs with only sung vocals and no heaviness to speak of. <br /> <br />1 - Ghost of Perdition [10:29] 9/10 - This stellar album-opener lets us know straight away that Opeth haven't changed their style much with this album.  They are still progressive metal enthusiasts in favor of death vocals that contrast with melodic singing.  This is quite a diverse track, with some Dream Theater-sounding parts, and a few passages which might surprise you.  It's one of the album's stronger songs, and shows that Opeth can make a 10 minute track seem a lot shorter when good songwriting is implemented. <br /> <br />2 - The Baying of the Hounds [10:41] 9.5/10 - After Ghost of Perdition, one might be expecting something softer to contrast with the heaviness and bombast ofthe opening track, but Opeth didn't do that this time.  The Baying of the Hounds is another epic, powerful work of progressive metal, with some great guitar soloing and crushing surges of guitar and vocals.  The band's new keyboardist also puts himself to good use on this album, with some cool effects.  I think that Opeth did just about everything right on this track, which is why I think that it might be the best that the album has to offer.   <br /> <br />3 - Beneath the Mire [7:57] 9/10 - Opeth continue with their three-song onslaught that introduces Ghost Reveries.  Beneath the Mire closes the trio with no less force than its predecessors.  This time, there is a middle-eastern sounding guitar riff thrown in for that infectious hook which many Opeth songs possess.  Laden with staccato drumming and what could be the album's best guitar solos, Beneath the Mire is a winner. <br /> <br />4 - Atonement [6:28] 6/10 - The triumphant, overpowering atmosphere set by the first three tracks is broken by Atonement.  In my opinion, this is the weak point of the album, as it does very little for me.  Admittedly, it's like no Opeth song you have heard before.  It has a distinct hippy vibe to it, which is not something that I enjoy in my Opeth songs.  It's obviously quite experimental, with some vocals that are slightly distorted, and come across as a tad annoying.  The song is not horrible, but I would call it mediocre at best, and it certainly breaks the flow of the album. <br /> <br />5 - Reverie/Harlequin Forest [11:39] 9/10 - After the little detour with Atonement, Opeth gets back on track with another big, heavy piece of music which acts as the centerpiece of the album.  This is the album's longest track, and a soaring, pulsing showcase for Opeth's songwriting talents.  There are some truly great melodies to be found, both in the lead guitar, and Mikael Akerfeldt's clean vocals.  Of course, there are also the trademark growls to alternate with the lush, heartfelt singing.It tends to drag a bit at the end with the instrumental section, but I didn't feel that it was overwrought or tedious.   <br /> <br />6 - Hours of Wealth [5:20] 8/10 - Here is another softer track, but this time it is done right, as Opeth abstained from the aimless experimentalism that plagued Atonement.  Hours of Wealth is similar in sound to the material found on Damnation, but it doesn't quite reach the same level of quality as the album's greatest moments, Windowpane and In My Time of Need.  Nevertheless, Hours of Wealth is a good song that starts out with some dreamy keyboard and is then joined by Mikael Akerfeldt's somber vocals, and eventually some delicate blues guitar.   <br /> <br />7 - The Grand Conjuration [10:21] 8/10 - To me, The Grand Conjuration is a very good song which suffers from too much repetition.  It has a cool solo, great, evil-sounding vocals, some heavy guitar riffage, and even some foreboding, well-executed softer passages.  However, the main guitar \\"theme\\" is used too much for its own good, and I feel like this track needed more variety.  Nevertheless, it is still very satisfying, but the repetition is what kept it from reaching the greatness of the other heavier tracks on this album. <br /> <br />8 - Isolation Years [3:51] 7.5/10 - The album's closer is a lonely, floating little song that offers no resolution, and leaves the album on a melancholy note.  It isn't a bad song, but it isn't a great one, either.  Like much of the material on Damnation, it lacks a certain conviction and direction that Opeth song's usually possess, but is nevertheless enjoyable. <br /> <br />As far as Opeth albums go, and how Ghost Reveries compares, this is how I would rank them all (best to worst--all are very close) <br /> <br />1) Morningrise <br />2) Still Life <br />3) Deliverance <br />4) Ghost Reveries <br />5) Blackwater Park <br />6) My Arms, Your Hearse <br />7) Damnation <br />8) Orchid <br /> <br />As you can see, I wuoldn't call Ghost ReveriesOpeth's best, but it's certainly up there, and I would almost consider it a tie with Deliverance.
B0002HS75Q|5.0|To say that \\"Spirited Away\\" is a Japanese anime that reminds you of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is very true but extremely simplistic. The literary reference is intended to emphasize the overwhelming creativity of creator Hayao Miyazaki (\\"Princess Mononoke,\\" \\"Kiki's Delivery Service,\\" \\"Castle in the Sky\\") and is not to suggest that this film is some sort of Japanese allegory of Lewis Carroll's surreal children's classic (not to say that you cannot find some intriguing parralels between the two). What I am and everybody else who makes this comparison is trying to convey to you is that the world to which 10-year-old Chirho (voiced by Rumi Hiiragi & Daveigh Chase) is as much a wonderland as what confronted Alice down the rabbit hole, even if it is just a bathhouse in this case.<br /><br />The story begins with a sullen Chirho moping about in the back of the family car as her parents take her to their new home in a new city. Then her father takes a fateful wrong turn and they discover what appears to be an abandoned theme park. But then her parents discover mountains of food, which they start greedily consuming. As Chirho explores the park things start to change and the spirits start to come out. Before she knows what has happened, her parents have been changed into pigs and Chirho finds herself in the land of the spirits. Her quest to rescue her parents and find her way home has begun.<br /><br />\\"Spirited Away\\" is not as rich of a visual feast as some classic examples of anime such as \\"Akira\\" and \\"Metropolis,\\" in part because Miyazaki disdains resorting to computer animation in favor of traditional animated cels. Even if there is not the overwhelming visual display of these other films there is still the attention to detail. But ultimately the reason why this is the biggest money making film in the history of Japan is because of the story, which has almost as much emotional impact on the audience as \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" (that is a mondo compliment from my perspective because \\"Grave\\" is the one anime that I decided to own and not just rent, although I did buy a copy of \\"Spirited Away\\" for my daughter, so I can borrow it when I want). Consequently, it is not surprising that this film took over the top spot in Japanese history from \\"Titanic,\\" because they both combine emotional stories with compelling visuals. I waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD (What? An anime film come to the Zenith City? Are you joking?), and it was every bit as good as I could have ever hoped.<br /><br />The Japanese title \\"Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi\\" literally translates as \\"The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro,\\" which will make only partial sense to you after you see the film. I was not surprised that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, but I was surprised, and gratified, that it won. I have been wondering what the current state of animated art would be in the world today if they had started giving this particular Oscar out a decade earlier and anime like \\"Akira,\\" \\"Metropolis,\\" and \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" were receiving wider attention if not flat out winning the award. \\"Spirited Away\\" is just the latest opportunity to open the door to the wonders of anime for an even wider audience.ve because \\"Grave\\" is the one anime that I decided to own and not just rent, although I did buy a copy of \\"Spirited Away\\" for my daughter, so I can borrow it when I want).

B0000AUHQT|3.0|What do you do when a classic piece of literature, a book that you've read and are very fond of, is brought to the screen in a horrendous rendition? Keep watching or stop, I guess, and for some reason I found it okay to keep watching. (This had nothing to do with the quality of the movie itself, which is pretty bad, but more with a personal sentimental feeling I have about the storyline and setting.) Robert Redford plays Jay Gatsby and he is terrible, totally wrong for the part. So is everyone else (though Sam Waterston as the narrator/participant Nick Carroway comes closest to being redeemable). The major problem is that Fitzgerald's starkly realistic novel is presented here as a fuzzy, soft-focus, mushy piece of fluff, with the trappings of West Egg (the parties, the silverware, fancy cars, etc.) taking top billing over the acting. It's overly long and pretentious. But the story of Jay Gatsby is just so moving and rich that even this disappointing movie can't destroy it completely. It could have and should have been so much better, though.

B00005JODA|3.0|3.5 /5 <br /> <br />The theatre was packed tonight, a Wednesday night, for what looked like a film that promised relief from the stream of duds and shallow movies as of late. <br /> <br />Ralf Fiennes plays Brit diplomat, Justin Quayle, on location in Kenya. His wife, 24 year-old Tessa (34 year-old Rachel Weisz) , tags along with handsome Dr. Arnold Bluhm as he visits the villages, dishing out medical aid. Tessa is a committed social activist, critical of conglomerates who hand out free medicine, etc., and pieces together her observations with the Dr. to come up with a conspiracy theory that she submits to a respected higher up in the British High Commission. Of course, big trouble later ensues. <br /> <br />Shot with many flash backs, the film is about Justin's one-man investigation of his wife's murder and the greedy players in the busines and political world who promise to profit enormously from the shady pharmaceutical industry's practices. <br /> <br />Some of camera work was disorienteering, as it is shot with a shaky hand-held camera. Some of the footage seems pointless. What's the point of having the scene with the bandits raiding the remote village? It's a bit disturbing to see the fleeing villagers being chased, shot or captured, while the huts burn to the ground. With a couple of scenes, you really get a sense of how little life is regarded over there as compared to the first world. <br /> <br />The main problem with this film is that it felt so unfocused. It's too long and drawn out. It's not a clear, succinct thriller. The sound in some of the room scenes is full of echoes. If you thought this was going to be anything like The English Patient, which also starred Ralf Fiennes, you will be surprised. The romance is played up but this is not a romance film. Fiennes, who is usually reserved in his roles, is surprisingly smiley with some boyish charm. Overall, the acting was quite solid.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|I have not yet read any of Clive Cussler's novels, but given how vehemently his fans are insisting that his books are so much better than this movie I will have to check them out because this movie is pretty good (and Cussler signed off on the script and the casting, which certainly undercuts complaints about the same).  Of course, any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie).  Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up.  Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here.<br /><br />\\"Sahara\\" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy.  It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask \\"how,\\" because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score).  Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes.  Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region.  However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson).  Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent.  Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way.<br /><br />These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (\\"Thoughtcrimes\\").  The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the \\"Panama,\\" which comes relatively early in the film.  I want to ask, \\"Whatever happened to saving the best for last?\\" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in \\"Raiders of the Lost Arc,\\" so why should that happen here?  Granted, \\"Sahara\\" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than \\"National Treasure,\\" probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality).<br /><br />Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film.  I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film.  For me the end result is that \\"Sahara\\" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety.  But if you want more, then look elsewhere.ctator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson).

B00003CXC7|5.0|Jimmy Stewart is a photojournalist confined to a wheelchair in his apartment with a broken leg. He spends most of his time gazing out the window at his neighbors, until one day he sees something that looks like a murder taking place. Grace Kelly plays his lover; she wants to marry him, but he thinks her pampered life makes her unsuitable for the rough life he leads. She, of course, leads the way in the dangerous murder probe they set out upon. It's to Hitchcock's credit that he had Kelly believe Stewart's story almost from the start, so we don't have to endure his trying to convince her it's true. (It also allows the picture to focus on its single point: she's no mamby-pamby and can do anything Stewart can.) The early going is rather slow - only the snappy dialogue saves it, though the suspense builds nicely near the end. Thelma Ritter is very good as Stewart's nurse - she has most of the wisecracking lines. The camera never leaves the apartment or the courtyard: Hitchcock loved the single setting idea during this time (see also ROPE AND LIFEBOAT). Definitely worth a watch.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I have never listened to this band before this album. I was actually just listening to launch on Yahoo and the video for Helena started playing. At first I didn't really know how to react, to think this was a stupid song or to fall in love with it. Well, turns out I LOVE IT!! I love the band so much I've got tickets to see them this September. Surprisingly enough, there is not one song on this cd that I don't enjoy. They all have a different toon and they all are so original. I respect anyone or any band that can write their own music and MCR is number 1 on my list. If you have never heard of them or just a curious listener searching for new music, i recommend MCR and this album. You'll either love it or you'll hate it, but if you love emo/punk and The Used, you'll definately love MCR. Not to mention, their frontman Gerard is pretty hot... and so what if he wears makeup...that's a plus!
0553573403|5.0|I actually got furious with people in this book, I have never done that before, I wanted to go in to the story and wreak some havoc of my own.  I also find it amazing when characters die and you don't see it coming.  AT ALL.  Upset me immensely but made me like the book all the more for it.  This is one of the best series out there, pick it up!  You won't regret it.
0679720200|2.0|Albert Camus has been the man behind the amazing popularity of this book.  Because of the disillusionment during the war, the characterization of Mersault is one of no emotions or sentiments.  While studying French, we had the chance to read and explore the language and its syntax, as well as the story and the theme of the \\"absurde\\".  Personally, the English version of this book does no justice to Albert Camus's impeccable style of description, or lack thereof.  The precision of French is lost in the translation to muddled English words.  The story comes off as one of plain repitition with no purpose, and the story becomes, at once, dull and unimaginative. <br /> <br />Frankly, I hated it.  Every single bit of it.  And I recommend that anyone with the knowledge of the French language ought to try it in French rather than English.
B00005LB50|3.0|Two years. Three albums. A four-disc retrospective. It wouldn't seem possible to get a more comprehensive treatment of a band's career than that promised by Buffalo Springfield's unimaginitively titled BOX SET. But in fact the producers of this gorgeously packaged, extensively annotated and beautifully remastered misfire have achieved the impossible by crafting an anthology at once bloated and incomplete.<br />  Far more legendary as the incubator of the careers of Stephen Stills, Neil Young and Richie Furay than for its own output - which included exactly one hit (\\"For What It's Worth\\") and a lot of highly influential but woefully underappreciated material besides - Buffalo Springfield could and should have had the mother of all box sets, one containing every note the band ever released as well as plenty of alternates, outtakes and demos. Instead, BOX SET gives us, in the course of its first three discs, all but FOUR of the group's released numbers (these being the original, nine-minute version of Stills' \\"Bluebird\\" as well as three tracks from the 1968 LAST TIME AROUND LP). Since none of the CDs runs much over an hour, this is absolutely inexcusable. Alternates and outtakes are fine; but when a band's entire catalogue could easily fit on two discs, to leave a handful of songs off a four-disc anthology is just...well, choose your favorite adjective.<br />  Padding things out instead is a wealth of previously unreleased material, including arguably too many solo demos by Young and transitional recordings which document the Springfield's disintegration into its various members' subsequent careers. Much of this is great stuff, though some of it is rather difficult to call Buffalo Springfield.<br />  The crowning irony, however, is disc four, whereon the first two Buffalo Springfield albums are presented in release order - even though every single one of these tracks with the sole exception (no pun intended) of \\"Mr. Soul\\" appears somewhere on the first three discs. This blatant bit of price-gouging, absurd enough in itself, is doubly awful in light of the tracks left missing from this \\"definitive\\" compilation.<br />  Given that fully half the material on BOX SET consists of rarities, and that all three Springfield albums are easily and cheaply available on CD, this box is clearly aimed at hardcore fans - which is to say, people who want to hear everything. That we don't is, alas, a tragic blight on a potentially (and largely) wonderful collection of music.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I have had this CD for almost 3 years and I havent written a review, well here I go. I kind of wanted to save this for when their new CD is out, and I actually already have it. The sounds on both the CDs vary. Whilst the songs here are catchy and beautiful on their second album their voices are improved and the music is amazing there too. I first fell in love with T.a.t.u. in summer 2002 when I heard thier single \\"All the things she said.\\" and fell in love with it and I would listen to the radio until it played it. Then the day it came out I went and bought it at Best Buy for $7. Not bad for a new and great CD that I listen to more than anything else in my collection. My favorite songs off the CD are: \\"All the things she said.\\", \\"Not gonna get us.\\", \\"30 Minutes.\\", \\"Show me Love.\\", \\"Stars.\\", and heck all of them are good. Also I happen to have listened to their new CD a few times already and the best songs are \\"All about us.\\" the first single, and \\"Loves me not.\\". T.a.t.u. is back and better than ever!!!!
B000002JS6|5.0|Yes \\"You shook Me All Night Long\\" was ruined by weddings and radio.Yes \\"Let Me Put My Love In To You\\" isn't one of their better songs, nor does it have good lyrics.But there is no denying the power of this album,the rest sure the hell makes up for it.This is definitely my second favorite album by them and their best with Brian.This album will never die and deserves it's eternity.
0743454537|5.0|The ending of this book had me in tears but I in no way thought it was a cop out, found it more like a punch in the gut.   I lent it out and had it returned to me by one friends while she was still in tears, saying that she needed to take a break and not read for a bit, it got to her that much.  I've read other books by Ms. Picoult and this is by far my favorite. Very good.

B0000560X3|5.0|I will no longer elaborate the merits and history of this great classic rock album. Without hesitation I can say that this is one of the greatest rock albums ever made. But Machine Head just got a lot better with the dvd audio format. The disc comes in two sound formats, the multi channel and high fidelity format. The full multi-channel surround sound of this album can be heard in high fidelity PCM creating a sound field with the ambience and fullness of a live performance. Imagine listening to this album as if Deep Purple is performing in front of you.This sound format is good witha 5.1 speaker system. The second sound format which is my favorite is capable of accurately represent an analog signal in digital form it has a Sample Size of 24 bits and a Sample Rate of 192KHz (24/192),The PCM stereo sound format of this album is capable of reproducing an audio signal with a frequency range of 0 to 96KHz with a dynamic range of 144dB. But in order to enjoy this format one should have a DVD AUDIO PLAYER. Machine Head is Deep Purple's greatest album it just got a lot better with this. This album is essential not just for Classic rock fans but for music lovers in general.
B00008BXJG|5.0|What can you say about AC/DC? One of the greatest bands of all-time.Angus is one of the best to pick-up the instrument,period. Bon Scott was one of the best frontmen to grace the microphone,period.Malcolm Young,Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd are one of the best rhythm sections,period.Phil Rudd is a breathe of fresh air as he holds time perfectly without having to resort to flash,as with this music he sure the hell could have.<br />This, the band's 8th album and unfortunately Bon Scott's last after drinking himself to death,is great in every sense of the word.It starts off with one of AC/DC's best songs,'Highway To Hell',a song that some christian fanatics accused them for being satan worshippers.If liking it makes me an unconscience satan worshipper than so be it.If listening to Michael Bolton makes me a christian than i'd rather worship the devil.<br />Next is 'Girl's Got Rhythm',another great track of pure rock 'n' roll sexuality.<br />'Walk All Over You' follows with a mixed tempo that kicks as hard.Angus' solo reads like he's trying to put out the fire that has caught his electric phallic.<br />'Touch Too Much' is next.It starts off slightly slower and a touch bluesier which is no where a bad thing.Great hooks fill the tune as usual and in no way hampers the album's mood.<br />Track #5-'Beating Around The Bush' starts off with an almost country rock sound from Angus and the gang.But once Bon starts singing you know that you're in the right place.Once again the boys pick it up when Angus starts to stroke and you can't seem to help banging or at least tapping along and the song ends in fury.<br />Track #6-'Shot Down in Flames' starts off with that familiar AC/DC sound that fans have come to love.Who isn't a fan now that i think of it.Who can deny the pure rock 'n' roll rhythm from this band,especially during this period.The song ends with AC/DC's trademark and Bon's sense of humor.<br />Track #7's 'Get it Hot' keeps the momentum going.If this is considered filler than so be it,it sure the hell complements the album.<br />Can't help but think of the movie 'Empire Records' every time I hear the next song,'If You Want Blood(You've Got it)' and that is not a bad thing,as watching Rory Cochrane and Anthony Lapaglia rocking out is my favorite scene of the movie.This,one of the band's best,resembles 'Shot Down in Flames' but purposely rocks out harder to erase any thought that this is a copycat.Bon's lyrics are like that of 'Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap' in that he'll bust some heads if need be.<br />The following track,'Love hungry Man' is a breather of sorts after kicking out so hard from the previous track and after about a minute the band get's it's second wind.In no way is this a bad thing as the entire album flows perfectly.No ballads or sappy songs.Just pure hard rock at arguably their best.<br />The final track 'Night Prowler' has a little bit of history as it was said to be believed that this was the inspiration for Richard Ramirez 'The Night Stalker' serial killer.So be it.It doesn't make me want to go out killing people as i'm sure that only lunatics take a song like this literally.This song is one of their bluesy numbers and again is not a bad thing as it ends the album almost perfectly.I always thought that they could have ended it the way they started it with 'If You Want Blood' but hey,I can't complain.The song ends with Bon saying 'Nanu Nanu' to add his sense of humor again to make sure that you don't take the lyrics about a stalker literally.Well at least it worked for the majority.<br />I suggest this album to any who have not experienced this band yet (is that possible?) over 'Back in Black' as that is the more well known of their stuff,and this should be recognized just as much.Definitely on my 100 Best Albums Of All-Time.complements the album.

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I was drawn to the 30 Seconds to Mars because of their unique sound. They had this sort of space age alternative rock sound. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was totally different from the other mainstream rock bands out there. 30 Seconds to Mars set the name for themselves as being an alternative rock band that does not care about commercial pleasure. All they wanted was to please the fans.  <br /> <br />With the release of \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" it seems that they have crossed the boundary from being a underground alternative rock into the more mainstream category. Their songs seem to fit this category more so than the first album. The first couple of songs sound great, but it seems that the beginning was just facade. Toward the middle of the album it starts to get bland, and then maybe it improves a little bit. Only the hidden tracks bring back the old 30 Seconds to Mars that we all know and love. The first hidden track \\"Battle of One\\" has harsh riffs that makes you want to bang your head. Its a fast paced song that is very pleasing. Don't get me wrong, there are more tracks on the album that I enjoy. My personal favorite track on the album (besides \\"Battle of One\\") is \\"The Kill.\\" The song has a great melodic part and is very rhythmically pleasing to the ear. The lyrics are very heartwrenching and emotional, and Jared (the singer) sings it very well. There is a short vocal part in the middle of song in which Jared does not even sing words. This part always seems to sway me into a more emotional state.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, the songs on this new album seems to be more gutwrenching. I wouldn't necessarily call it \\"emo\\" but it definately has some \\"emo\\" touches in it. Some of the songs can be overly emotional and in a sense, \\"hopelessly romantic.\\" Its not that I do not like lyrics with \\"emotional\\" topics, it is just that I am used to the 30 Seconds to Mars that sang about space, and not sing about cliche things.  <br /> <br />Overall, its a decent album, but not as good as the original. The more you listen to it, the more you enjoy it. It is still worth the buy!!
6305428050|5.0|It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.......... Extremely entertaining
0679882820|4.0|This is my absolute favorite book.  I try to make it a habit to read at least once a week.  It seems like everytime I read it, I realize something different about it that I just didn't understand the times before.  I still can't Moo, but I am working on it.  I suggest this to anyone who's curious about cows.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains for me has always been an inspiration,a band that I  always felt that i could relate to.Their music has gotten me through some really rough times and for that i will always be grateful.This album is one of my all-time favs, with some of their best songs.Dirt has to go on my most listened to albums list, right up there with some of the greats.Perfect from beginning to end.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|About the album, it's good, but not great.  Had I heard this a few years ago, I may not have had the patience to sit through it all.  Jarod's skills and focus have matured since their self-titled debut.  His work here is deep and full of emotion.  As he's said in his biography of making the record (on the band's website), it's more basic and raw.  In fact, your best review can be found in that biography, in his own words. <br /> <br />**************************************************************** <br />But I have to warn you that the anti-piracy software on this disc will not let you enjoy all this hard work in the same way you are use to.  Do you like to download to your computer to listen while you work?  The \\"Copy Control\\" software prevents Windows Media Player from doing this.  They do allow downloads through the disc's own program, but it limits WMP's other features.  Now listen to this, because many of you will want to know about the other problems with the software BEFORE YOU BUY THIS DISC.  You CAN NOT download this disc to your iPod or MP3 player!  Immortal, Virgin, and EMI have decided that the only way you can listen to the copyright YOU PAID FOR is through the disc alone.  It's happening people.  The crimes of the few are affecting the freedoms of the many!  I'm all for a company protecting itself, but this is TOO MUCH!  I bought my MP3 player to use!  I like 30S2M!  I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC I PAID FOR IN THE FORMAT I'VE ALSO PAID FOR!!!!!!!!!!!  DO YOU HEAR US IMMORTAL, VIRGIN, and EMI?  RE-RELEASE THIS RECORD WITHOUT THE \\"COPY CONTROL\\" SOFTWARE!!!!  AT LEAST LET US LISTEN TO WHAT WE'VE PAID YOU FOR WITH OUR iPODs!!!!!!!!!! <br />**************************************************************** <br /> <br />I've always supported the bands I like by continuing to buy CDs.  But if you guys are going to start pulling stuff like this, count me out!  I'll find another way.  I will never buy another disc with \\"Copy Control\\" technology!  Please let the record companies know you won't stand for this either.  Demand that another solution be found!  I'm returning this disc for a full refund!

0061015725|3.0|For school, students have to read a book from a summer reading list and I chose the book \\"PREY\\" by Michael Crichton.  This book is a story of love, deceit, mystery, and tragedy.  This book tells the story of how one man, with the help of a team of micro-robot specialists, try to take down a self-sustaining, self-reproducing cloud of nanoparticles in the middle of the Nevada desert.  Yeah, these nanoparticles may be small, but they are definitely a force to be reckoned with.  I thought that this book was interesting and exciting to read.  The first time I saw it, I was horrified to see that there were so many pages because I really don't like to read.  Another weakness that this book has is its many confusing words.  You have to have a good vocabulary to understand this book.  But while reading \\"PREY\\", I found that it was hard to stop reading because at the end of every chapter in this book, Michael Crichton draws the reader into reading more by providing a suspenseful conflict.  Here are some quotes about what I am talking about:  Over the headset, Bobby said, \\"Four knots and falling. Fast.  \\"Let's go everybody,\\" I said.  I was herding them towards the door.  Then Ricky came on. \\"No.\\"  \\"What?\\" \\"You can't leave now.\\" \\"Why not?\\"  \\"Because it's too late. They're here.\\"  Quotes like these make the readers want to read more.  Overall I enjoyed this book and I would recommend \\"PREY\\" to anyone who is interested in science fiction books.  But if you read this book, remember, that things aren't always as they appear to be.
B00005JN5X|4.0|just got back from seeing The Brothers Grimm and like all of terry gilliams movies i thought it was excellent.granted it is not one of his best it does deserve acclaim for being an entertaining film.the production design is just incredible as so are the special effects. i don't give it a perfect score because it isn't perfect.i'm not sure whether it was the theatre that i saw it in or not but alot of the film is dark and i thought could have been better lit, even if alot of the film takes place either in the dark or indoors by candle light.how happy i was to see jonathan pryce back, as he's good in everything that i've ever seen him in.damon and ledger do credible jobs,especially ledger, even if their english accents aren't the best.as with all of gilliams films it is extremely imaginative and well done.i am looking forward to the dvd release and hope that they'll be a making of doc.yet another gilliam film to add to my collection.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|\\"Friends\\" is my favorite TV show ever. And judging by its success, popularity and longetivity, the best show too. It is well-written and perfectly acted by a fantastic ensembel cast. This was the show that introduced us to Ms. Jennifer Aniston, the most beautiful woman in the world (IMHO). Sadly, now that she is available, I'm married. (Kidding!) <br />Dave Schwimmer cracks me up. They all do, in fact. Especially Lisa Kudrow, the classic dumb blonde. She says such stupid things that she is even wise sometimes, like Yogi Berra.  <br /> <br />The amazing thing about \\"Friends\\", and something you'll appreciate when you watch all 10 seasons, is that it NEVER lost steam. The quality was consistent from start to finish. That is a rare feat indeed! <br /> <br />
B0006213WG|3.0|First off, to address the reviewer below me, if you knew anything about Metallica, you'd know that Cliff Lee Burton (greatest metal bassist ever, may he R.I.P.), was CREMATED. Therefore, he isn't in a grave. And I don't see how he'd be specifically mad about \\"The Bitter End\\"; he'd be mad if Sum 41 tried to rip off something like \\"Anesthesia\\" or \\"Orion.\\" The only one that may be mad would be Kirk Hammett, whom Sum 41 copies a lot of his guitar style, particularly, his \\"battery\\" solo. <br /> <br />So onto the actual review, I used to be a big Sum 41 fan about 3-4 years ago. Since then, I've moved onto older rock (Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, AC/DC), metal (Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Slayer, Judas Priest, and to an extent, Dream Theater and Mastodon), and even REAL punk (The Clash, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, and arguably, Rancid). So having deviated from pop-punk, I decided to listen to this new \\"heavier\\" Sum 41. Now there are definite notable traces of \\"imitation\\": \\"We're all to blame\\" sounds strikingly similar to \\"Chop Suey\\" by System of a Down, and \\"The bitter End\\" has already been noted to be nearly an exact, shorter copy of Metallica's \\"Battery.\\" I find this to be both a good and a bad thing; they are obviously drawing influence from better bands (Metallica, System of a Down, Iron Maiden, etc.) and they prove to be technically proficient to be able to imitate their sound. But its not original; if we wanted to hear incredible Kirk Hammett shredding, we'd listen to old Metallica.  <br /> <br />So in short, this album is not bad, its Sum 41's third best. Their best album would have to be Does This Look Infected?, a darker and angstier sound with metal influence (e.g. \\"No Brains\\" and \\"Hooch\\"), ultimately bordering on the classification of grunge music. Their second best would have to be the horribly underrated Half Hour of Power. This is their third (The horribly overrated mainstream All Killer No Filler, despite its title, is the worst). <br /> <br />There are still notable songs of this CD: \\"We're all to Blame,\\" \\"No Reason,\\" \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" and \\"88.\\" \\"Some Say\\" is more or less a copy of \\"Handle This\\" from All Killer No Filler. <br /> <br />So, hats off to Sum41 for showing they are much more talented than their contemporaries, for showing they can shred guitar solos. But points off for lack of originality. <br />
B00005JN5X|5.0|Given how much movies have sucked in the last year or two, I've been pleasantly suprised this summer.  I've seen a couple movies in the last month that I can't wait to get on DVD, and The Brothers Grimm is one of them.   <br /> <br />The movie is sharp, witty, suspenseful, funny, well acted, and well scripted and a general good time.  It also is classic Terry Gilliam, and reminds me more  of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" then anything Gilliam has done in the last decade.  It also manages to completely avoid any similarity to his worst flick, Time Bandits, a movie so painful to watch that it makes my short list of worst movies ever.  You'll notice that the people who hated this movie all mentioned loving Time Bandits, so that tells you a little something about their taste.   <br /> <br />I also have to praise the acting in this movie, Heath Ledger and Matt Damon completely surpassed my expectations of them.  The last thing I saw Ledger in was \\"Knights Tale\\" which is fluffy teenage fair, so to see him in something where he is not just relying on good looks was a shocker, he actually can act.  And Matt Damon was so into his character that I was able to forget that it was Matt Damon in bad sideburns.  Kudos to both.  The supporting cast was also great, special props to MacKenzie Crook, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite supporting guys and Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce gave the kind of quality performances I've come to expect from them. <br /> <br />All in all, a great fun flick.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I haven't even heard this album and it is my favorite album ever.  I just looked at the outside and loved it.  If you spread mayo on it that doesn't make it a sandwhich get my drift?  I hope everyone takes a minute to listen to this album.  It has many songs which can be heard if you know what I mean.  Try using your ears get it?  I usually throw my cd's like a frisbe and whichever one goes the furthest is the best.  This one went the second furthest.  ACDC went the furthest but I don't like them, but I guess they must be by favorite get it?  I Hope this is a good band to have come over to your house.  I don't get to have them come over but if they did I would like them but are they good to have?  I am not from death cab for cutie, but that doesn't mean I can't like to listen to them if you know what I mean ok.  I hope this is helpful.  Don't worry about it if you can't remember all the words to all the songs.  There are alot of words to songs.  The dictionary has more.  I once looked up the word \\"sponge\\" in the dictionary then I remembered what it was so I didn't have to read the definition.  Death cab for cutie will make a great gift for the holidays.  Thanks for everything Ben Gibbard!!!!  I'll see you all in london if you know what I mean.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|I am a big fan of Shaun Penn- have been since \\"Fast Times\\", and here he gives the performance of his career as the titled \\"Dead Man\\". He is a death row inmate, at first shows no sign of remorse. He meets a Nun, played by Susan Sarandon, who I loved since \\"Bull Durham\\" (the BEST baseball film!) and she shows him that he has a conscience after all. <br />The film teaches a lot about the inhumanity of the Death Penalty and gives us two master performances. This is the best movie!
0895260131|1.0|Robert Spencer, who sits on the board of a group dedicated to propagandizing and converting Muslims into christians, has written a book for those people whose dream is to expand the war on terrorism into a war on all heathen muslims.   The book isn't really research into Islam, its black propoganda using isolated quotes from Islamic works.  The research is at the level of most books that try to demonize other religions and convert believers away from their religion. <br /> <br />The book's idea is that Islam is an evil system that cannot coexist with any other religion.  Spencer's argument fails because he doesn't recognize that all the things he is attacking Islam over can be found among many christian groups as well.  Dominionists assert that they as christians have the obligation to rule the world.  There are also many christian groups who on a routine basis demand that the bible's laws be made the laws of countries and who claim that America is a Christian country.  And many believe they have an obligation to spread christianity to every person in the world by whatever means necessary. <br /> <br />Robert Spencer's material on the crusades is just wrong.  The crusades started with massacres in european cities of Jews.  Moving on to the holy land, they massacred the entire population of Jerusalem in celebration of their victory.  Men, women and children were all killed.  The Jews of the city were singled out for massacre and burned alive in their holy places where they took refuge.  They also looted the mosque of Omar and distributed the contents among the kinghts.  They acted like savages.  After they took over, they turned out to be bigger oppressors of eastern christians than the muslims were.   <br /> <br />While most crusaders eventually took oaths that they would restore the lands they conquered to the Byzantine Empire, they ignored the oaths and founded their own kingdoms in their own names in the east.  Their new Kingdoms including Edessa, Jerusalem and Antioch.  All were ruled over by crusaders who turned christian and muslim alike into fedual serfs. <br /> <br />After the first crusade, they crusaders kept coming east.  By the fourth crusade, they were too cowardly to fight the muslims and started attacking eastern christians.  They burned and looted Constantinpole, desecrated its churches and then took the christian lands of greece as kingdoms for themselves.  The Crusaders brought ruin to greece.  Eventually, the crusaders starting launching crusades within western europe.  The Albigensian crusade in southern france involved the massacre of christians and the transfer of their lands/property to the crusaders.  It was a war for loot against christians. <br /> <br />That is the politically incorrect truth of the crusades which Robert Spencer doesn't tell in his book.

038542471X|5.0|All Grisham is great. He isn't the number one bestselling author for nothing, but this one is his best, IMHO. The movie with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones, two of my favorite actors, was good, but the book was 10 times better. Rarely is a movie better than the book, especially with Grisham. The writing is so rich and he fleshes out the characters and their motivations better than Hollywood could. <br />Reading this book, I could really relate to the boy (\\"The Client\\" of the title) and all he went through.  <br />It was a very suspenseful and rewarding read. So much so that I read the book in just 3 days!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Loved the musical, love the music!  Recommended even if you haven't seen the stage production.
B00004T9UF|3.0|This was the first hip-hop album i ever bought. I thought it was really great, and i listened to it all the time. My favorites was Criminal(18) and The Real Slim Shady(8). I just couldn't get enough of it! <br />   After a while, I started to listen to artists as Gang Starr. Jeru the Damaja, KRS-One, Nas, and many others. I think Eminem doesn't have a chance against the hip hop of the 90's. <br />   I don't listen to Eminem any more, and his newest albums is nothing but desperate tries of earning money.... <br /> <br />This album still get a 3 star, because it got me into hip-hop. I think the best tracks are Remember me(9) and Amityville(14). Don't think Eminem fans agree with me there... <br /> <br />Old school 4 ever
B00000C3G6|5.0|My first high school True Love turned me on to this album when it came out. I bought it as a cutout in 73 but I can't wait for the cd to get here as I wore out the grooves on the album by playing it 1000 times and I disconnected my turntable years ago. This album is right up there with any CSN or CSNY album. Page 43 still gives me goosebumps not to mention Southbound Train.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Clint gave us another masterpeice here. Kevin Bacon, Shaun Penn, Tim Robbin are an ensemble cast here. The movie, like the great book it was based on, is full of surprises, and is an emotionally charged. <br />Tim Robbin and Penn definitely 100% deserved their Oscars here. Then Clint gave us the \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", which did it again! <br />I'm happy to see great directors giving Kevin Bacon great roles. Bacon doesn't get the credit he deserves, but he will! <br />I won't tell you the ending- you have to see it for yourself.
B000268QB2|5.0|I have never heard of this group before, but I saw them on Saturday Night Live (I promise you I was only watching SNL cause I can't receive good reception on the Mad TV channel) SNL SUCKS with the new casts, they are worst than a elementary school play!! ....and I digress..I don't know why people always compare mainstream people to non. Can't new or nonmainstream people do their stuff without having it associate with others. By doing that, I think it takes a little credit from them when they truely have a style on their own. Keane is great. Must have if you like a more mellow type music without that harsh screeching guitar sound. Chaplin's voice is awesome.  Let's hope they continue their good music in future albums and more recognition.
B00004TWZF|5.0|What a great movie! It is long but it goes quick with great performances by all the cast, but the movie really was made that much better with Jean Reno in both a serious and comical role. If you have a good sound system then this is one of the best movies I have ever listened to. The music is very dramatic with heaps of bass. I must admit it is not your every day run of the mill type of movie and can be considered 'alternative' and yet it could very well be real 'true to life'. <br />I highly recommend this movie to be in everyone's DVD collection.
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer's debut album is an example for many others to follow.  I absolutely love this CD and listen to it over and over and over again.  My favorite songs are:  ALL OF THEM!  Buy this awesomely heavy CD, pop it into your CD player, and enjoy!  The skip track button is not needed.
6305078491|2.0|In this film you get:     An old geriatric vampire that needs help walking around.    People that leave their bodies and become dual exposure \\"ghosts\\" yet they can interact with their surroundings as if they were corporeal.    People acting in the movie as though it was a silent film, even though it's not.    The weirdest death scene ever, someone gets buried alive in flour!    Even though I'm a fan of old horror movies, I had a real tough time with this film.  I wanted to like it, but there were so many problems with overacting, the lack of dialogue, and there's not much in the way of a coherent story.  I wouldn't be the least bit suprised to find out that there are bits of the film missing from this print.  It is very atmospheric and creepy, though.    The copy of the movie used here is damaged, the subtitles (what little dialogue there is is in German) are very poorly done, with large black boxes around the letters.  There's also a large black border all the way around the screen, so even though the film is the correct aspect ratio for full screen viewing, it is \\"letterboxed\\" all the way 'round.  Oh, and the sound is so low that even with it turned up all the way I could barely hear it.  This movie looks like it was made in 1922, not 1932.      The bonus film that you get with the DVD is actually better than the main attraction, with an excellent story and wonderful animation.  It's a pity that they had to tack it on to the main feature, probably because an old movie called \\"Vampyr\\" will sell, whereas an unknown film would not.    If you must see it, don't buy it, rent it.
B000002IST|5.0|We Can't Dance(1991) is probably the best album of Genesis as a trio. It also marks the end of the Phil Collins era. You've got to admit that this is their best effort. The album starts out with the powerful NO SON OF MINE which topped the charts at number twelve. JESUS HE KNOWS ME is one of the more fun songs on the album that talks about television evangelists. DRIVING THE LAST SPIKE is the best song on the album and there hasn't been a Genesis epic this good since 1973. I CAN'T DANCE is the weakest song on the album which sounds like wanna-be ACDC. NEVER A TIME isn't bad but isn't anything to brag about. Now DREAMING WHILE YOU SLEEP is an excellent song that sounds a bit like I Can't Dance but isn't corny. TELL ME WHY is another great song that sounds a bit like the solo songs that Phil Collins does in the years to come. LIVING FOREVER has some prog-rock moments in it and some great guitar by Mike Rutherford. HOLD ON MY HEART is a ballad but not like the messes in the previous album. WAY OF THE WORLD is a swingin' song with great oriental-like keys from Tony Banks. SINCE I LOST YOU is the best Genesis ballad, along with Hold On My Heart. And then comes the grand finale, FADING LIGHTS. This song is appropriate since this is Genesis last good album. Elements of old-school Genesis are in here as well. I think that this album would have been better if it had songs like the edgy ON THE SHORLINE and HEARTS ON FIRE on it. On the Shorline is the best rock song of the 90s in my opinion. This is still a great album but sadly, after this, Genesis really turns bad.
B000002VRZ|4.0|I had purchased this CD only for the 2 songs I knew, \\"Green Grass and High Tides\\" and \\"There Goes Another Love Song.\\" To me, that would have been enough. To my delight, I discovered a whole body of top-notch, fabulous Southern rock that I'd never heard before. This CD is just consistently excellent all the way through, a much better buy than I'd hoped for.
B00005U122|5.0|First let me say that being an enormous pink floyd fan for thirty odd years I was blown away by this dvd compilation.  Roger Waters has continued to bring forth only the best and most sincere of the music of pink floyd.  Unlike Gilmour,Wright and Mason, Waters brings a much less commercial approach to his concerts and remains true to the origins of Pink Floyd and its cofounder Sid Barrett.  The technical aspects of this DVD are also outstanding, the sound has been mixed impeccably and youll notice the quality immediately on your surround sound system.  So if your a true fan steer away from the product gilmour is producing and give floyds founding member a try, you wont be disappointed.  Promise!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes 2001 debut- \\"Is This It?\\" is clearly the best CD the 21st century has been privied to listen to. The band manages to capture everything rock is about; though not only through thier music. Between their vintage clothing, kinky haired, sleepy eyed \\"dont give a @#!%\\" attitude, and thier genuine love of music- you can tell these prep school punks used thier time in the Dwight School to study up, not in the purely academic sense, but of cource concentrating on thier musical influences whom they maticulously imitated in both sound and attitude. The result of this carefully constructed journey into the world of 60's and 70's rock (namely Sir John Lennon and the village's own Television) shaped the band's persona. This all rubs off on this beatifully produced CD: Julian Casabalncas takes responsiblities as the lyricist/composer-in-charge, while fab rocks the drums, nikolai rips up the base in his own quiet but anarcaic way, nick valensi plays rythem guitar insync with none other than albrert hammond jr- both are more than capable of giving over fast paced licks that keep coming at you throughout every song. I dont know if the strokes or any other band for that matter can live up to the personality, flair and sound this debut record carries over, we'll have to wait and see. However, The Strokes third album is only months away from being released- I know I'm just going to have to wait with almost as much anticipation as everyone had for the debut LP!

B00006RJHG|5.0|This rare slasher proudly stands above the honorable mentions such as Friday the 13th, Maniac, Madman, and many other slashers. This lost gem stars young new stars such as Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin, and Keir Dullea <br />   It's about a crazed killer that climbs up the chimney of a sorority house and sneaks into the attic. He then sneakily kills a girl, hiding her in the attic. Most of the movie is about trying to find out what happened to her. Jess Bradford, a girl who lives in the sorority house, is getting menacing phone calls. We then realize where the calls are coming from.. In the house..... <br />     When a Stranger Calls obviously stole the plot from Black Christmas, but anyway, Black Christmas is an underatted and lost gem that should never be forgotten in the horror genre.. <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|...this album is such an amazing journey through stories of death and love and the mind...i had a promo copy and it hasn't left my CD player since...i IMMEDIATELY put it on my iPod and i've been letting all of my friends in on the action...they've all loved it...i've been hearing that some fans are nothing but disappointed by \\"Plans\\"...saying that it's \\"too mainstream\\"...but that couldn't be less true...this is still very true to Death Cab...i couldn't be more pleased...Ben is and always will be viewed as one of the greatest vocalist/songwriters of our time...his voice is just so comfortable...and along with Walla and the others, he's created yet another masterpiece...BUY THIS ALBUM...it's amazing...
B000244FDW|5.0|This depiction of Pride and Prejudice is the most accurate one I've seen.  The dialogue is taken straight out the book and the actors portray Austen's characters beautifully.
B000063147|5.0|This is my all time favorite album right now. It's probably the best A7X album too. I'll go through the tracks: <br /> <br />1. To End the Rapture: An intro, nothing special. 4/5 <br /> <br />2. Turn the Other Way: Great start to a great album. Starts off great. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Darkness Surrounding: One of my favorite tracks. A really nice heavy track that shows A7X's true potential. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. The Art of Subconscious Illusion: Another one of my favorite tracks. Weird lyrics but the guitars and drums make up for it. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. We Come Out at Night: The screaming sounds great with the beat on this track. Great beat. Great track. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Lips of Deceit: GREAT song! Starts off like it's going to be a slow track but then speeds up and sounds amazing. 5/5 <br /> <br />7. Warmness on the Soul: A good slow song but just doesn't suit my taste. 4/5 <br /> <br />8. An Epic of Time Wasted: AMAZING! My all time favorite song! Blows me away after 1 minute through. I highly recommend listening to this track! 10/5 <br /> <br />9. Breaking Their Hold: Nice song but only 1:11 long. Still great for what it is though. 4/5 <br /> <br />10. Forgotten Faces. A very catchy song that I like. One of my favorites. 5/5 <br /> <br />11. Thick and Thin: Another catchy song. The chorus is great. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. Streets: A very punk-ish song but still pretty good. 5/5 <br /> <br />13. Shattered by Broken Dreams: A great way to end the album. A bit slower but speeds up a bit in the middle and sounds great, even though it goes on for about 7 minutes. 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall: Buy this cd! It's an amazing cd and a great start for A7X. Hope this helps you in buying it!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I like all of the songs, voices with the music etc. but I wasn't exactly thrilled with the CD.  Other friends that listened to it thought it \\"awesome\\".
0765301598|4.0|A good finale to the \\"prequel\\". For Dune lovers I say go for it.
B0000027RL|5.0|Why? Well it should be obvious. From '89 to '91 hairmetal was really starting to suck, it was bad before then too, but at least it was tolerable. Talented hairbands like Twisted Sister and Motley Crue gave way to crap rip-offs like Warrant and Poison. And on top of that we had that lame pop from Paula Abdul, and dear lord, Color Me Badd. Needless to say, it was a dismal era in music. Then the whole grunge explosion happened in late '91 with the song 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' by Nirvana. Although the topics were often times depressing and had mediocre instrument players, the grunge bands were damn talented and sounded near flawless. Pearl Jam happened to be one of them. Maybe Nirvana started the grunge explosion, but Pearl Jam made it into a new wave of music. Songs like 'Alive', 'Porch', 'Evenflow', and especially 'Jeremy' will grab your attention and make you listen to TEN more than once. It may not be as good as other debuts such as Nirvanas 'Bleach' or Alice In Chains 'Facelift', but its still a five star. Eddie Veddar had a unique voice and combined with Stone Gossards and Mike McCready's riffs, it was bound to make history. Jeff Amments basslines are INSANE, he is the Geddy Lee of grunge. Unforunately Krusen was no Grohl, but he was still good and provided at least decent rythems for PJ. Right, my favorite songs are the three singles ('Jeremy', 'Evenflow', 'Alive'), 'Porch', and 'Black'. If you like grunge then you have this already, if you dont then get it now, or consider yourself a poser like Creed.
B0000CE742|5.0|This is one of the most awesome compilations of songs spanning Cher's decades-long career!  From the earliest to the most recent of her hits, this CD has it all.  Highly recommended for any Cher fan.  I just hope she keeps on recording so that one day a huge box set will become available.  Enjoy the CD!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I am often ridiculed for liking SOAD, mainly because I've somehow managed to root myself deep into \\"emo\\" territory, where the kids are more close-minded about music than people who only listen to rap and rap-affilates. True, SOAD is one of the few 'nu-metal' (if you can even call it that) bands I really enjoy, but the creativity of the whole band just blows my mind every time I hear it. 'Mesmerize' reminds me of Frank Zappa's 'Apostrophe' for some reason, and there are few errors on the record. My main complaint is that Serj does not get to really showcase his amazing singing ability because the guitarist (and co-producer!) really hogs the mic. Serj is what got me into this band; guitarist need to stick to guitar and not try to be the front-man. This is the worst case of vocal-envy I have heard in a long time. Other than that, the album is solid and really rather epic. Anti-war themes are getting to be old-hat, but 'Mesmerize' uses such in-depth ways of stating their postitions that I can't help but wonder sometimes if the album truly does concern war or if it's just a 'fun' album? I think maybe this is what SOAD was going for.
038572179X|5.0|This is an exceptionally well-reviewed novel, so I'm not sure what I can hope to add to the discussion.  In fact, you should probably not read this review any further than the second paragraph if you've not read the book, which makes the review pretty much useless.  That said, I kind of want to talk about the book a little, so here goes.    This is simply an outstanding work of an immesurable talent at the height of his game and powers.  The sense of time and place, the depth of the characters, and the power of the love story that gives much of the novel its backbone make it impossible to put down and difficult to forget.  What also struck me was the author's confidence.  I think many of us at times take a healthy dose of (at times unknowing) skepticism and cynicsm into novels -- particularly novels that make no bones about the fact that they fully intend to manipulate and at times to use unconventional devices.  Reading these kinds of novels often pits the reader against in the author in the early chapters, requiring the author to build a tower of credibility on which the novel's success ultimately depends.  But, for me at least, a writer's confidence in his or her abilities can sometimes shortcut this process, immediately break down the wall of skepticsm and pull you by force into a state of surrender where you can be swept up by the ride.  I thought of two very different authors while I read Atonement, who have done this -- Faulkner and Cormac McCarthy.  McEwan is of course thematically much different from them, but he shares (and more importantly communicates) that kind of confidence, which makes the reader's (or, at least, this reader's) experience that much more rewarding.     Like others of you, I too am a fan of the metafiction elements of this novel.  It's not an accident, I expect, that my two favorite reads this calendar year were this novel and Everything Is Illuminated -- two novels that are as much about writing and writers as they are about what theyare \\"about.\\"  But it comes with something of a cost in this novel; two costs really.  First, I thought it funny that one of the reviews reproduced in the beginning of the book describes McEwan as being \\"invisible\\" during the read.  I disagree entirely.  When a writer writes about a writer, it is virtually impossible for him not to give the reader at least the illusion that he is writing about himself.  And when McEwan critiques or discusses Briony's attempts at writing in the novel, he is plainly critiquing and discussing his own work.  This is an \\"inside baseball\\" aspect to Atonement that causes you while reading to be starkly reminded, \\"hey, I'm reading a novel.\\"  Second, in order to accomplish his novel-in-a-novel surprise, McEwan needs to keep certain details from you until the end.  The most important is to not let you know (again spoiler coming) that Robbie has died.  As a result, he cannot spend even a second having Briony grieve about Robbie (or her sister).  As a result, at the end of the book, Briony is just too reprehensible and ulikeable; while the book does not depend on her likeability (actually quite the opposite), at the end she is simply thoroughly detestable.  Indeed, you learn that many of the parts of the book that give her some likeability were simply things she manufactured about herself and didn't happen. It's always all about her -- right to the end, as a 77 year old, we find a woman luxuriating in her guilt to an absurdly self-absorbed level.    Finally, as great as the story and reading experience are, the take-away questions from this book are a little disappointing.  It essentially asks the question, is there such thing as atonement?  The bleak conclusion is that there is not.  There are acts, crimes, consequences, and guilt.  \\"Atonement,\\" is besides the point, and little more than a fancy word to describe the actor's ability or inclination to forgive herself.  A task that becomes, I guess this novel tells us, both a little more easy anda little more complicated if the actor happens to be a novelist.    So, that small disappointment aside, I loved this book.  It's my first novel by this author, and I can't wait to read the rest.
B0009W5JS2|4.0|I think this one was way better than the first , first of all the characters are alot more fleshed out than the first xxx. second the camera work and movie just look better than the first one, and ice cube is a better smarter xxx, hes ex navy seal so it makes sence he knows how to use all the gadgets and weapons,with vin diesel it didnt make any sence how an extreme sports guy would know how to use advanced weaponry. Lastly this is an actually good movie the first one was an annoying sports stunt after another until the movie finished.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|The title probably says it all.  This is definitely not my favorite, but there are still some great tracks.  This album won't change the minds of those who already dislike this band, or drive away those who do.  Since this is their first major label release, I suppose that's not such a bad thing.  I would suggest if you are new to DCFC to try another album as your introduction.  Any of the three previous will do.  So that said, I really enjoyed the album, but then again I have enjoyed DCFC for some time now.  Ben has a very sweet voice, which in my opinion works well with the subject matter he writes about.  It is never over emotional, but more like the voice in your head.  Calm and almost methodical in its working through life's ordeals.  The first four tracks are real stand outs for me.  The first and fourth being my favorite of the bunch.  Although I don't really feel strong about the melody in \\"What Sarah Said\\" the lyrics really hit me hard.  The Last two songs are great closers.  All in all, no changes to report.  I for one am glad.
0385337388|2.0|I bought this book because I had heard many mixed reviews about it from people in the medical profession.  I myself have found that there are a few nuggets of insightful commentary hidden amongst the sexist, racist, mindless, lewd and all together poorly written drivel which makes up most of the book.  This being said, the book can be pretty funny at times, and might be worth a read for a laugh or two if you can stand all the pointlessly captalized words.

B000A3DFZE|4.0|Like Van Morrison, many of us have a nostalgic connection to Eric Clapton dating back nearly forty years. We hope that each new record will catapault us back to the emotional sunshine of the 60's and 70's; a return to those days when the music was new and ground-breaking. It isn't to be because it can't be new anymore; but it can be refreshing. This the case with Back Home. Eric Clapton has gotten back to combining blues, reggae and R&B into catchy tunes that leave you satisfied. Perhaps not in a league with Journeyman, Back Home does enter that territory. Although Pilgrim was excellent musically  it was a very difficult record to listen to because of its themes and therefore had a limited repeat-listening lifespan. Reptile lacked punch. The return to his catchy pop sensibilities is quite welcome. We probably won't experience the \\"Oh Wow\\" of a 461 Ocean Boulevard again but this is a fine reminder of how it used to be. This is a fun record and recommended
1593072937|5.0|\\"The Hard Goodbye\\" (originally entitled simply \\"Sin City\\" when first published) tells us (a small part of) the story of Marv, a brute with a heart of gold, a head condition, a face that looks like Baghdad and a taste for stylish coats and witty remarks. We join him as he is about to have the night of his life with Goldie, a \\"goddess\\" who \\"smells like angel's ought to smell\\", and we are just as clueless as he is about how he got there... and who gets to kill her in her sleep. <br /> <br />That's only the first, though, of the many bits of a big and menacing puzzle that we will be piecing together as the story advances. And that's one of the most interesting features of this comic book (all seven volumes): it's not only it's illustrations nor the use it makes of the page-layout, but the very way this more or less simple story is narrated. <br /> <br />Frank Miller says it himself at the very end of this 208-page volume: \\"This one ran away with itself. I'd planned it as forty-eight pages, but I got carried away.\\" And it surely runs like hell: the dark and thrilling story seems to \\"run away with itself\\" just as Marv does at the beginning of the story, and you are almost sad that it has to end at all. Lucky for us, this is only the first of seven. Definitevly a great buy. Five stars. A must read.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Not much to say other than: buy this movie! You will not be disappointed.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot, while not the most \\"punk\\" of Green Day's albums, is probably their best. One misconception that most people seem to have  is that this is a political album mainly made against Bush. While there is a political edge in a few songs during the album, this is not a political album, but a \\"punk rock opera\\" telling the story of Jesus of Suburbia. Every song on this album is unique, bringing many new aspects to the pop/punk genre. \\"American Idiot,\\" \\"St. Jimmy,\\" and \\"She's a Rebel\\" are typical Green Day songs, while \\"Wake me up When September Ends,\\" and \\"Whatsername\\" tap into the side of Green Day similar to the song \\"Good Riddance.\\" The two nine minute songs \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" manage to stay interesting, despite their length. All the songs flow seamlessly into each other, often changing pace dramatically, as in the transition from \\"Are we the Waiting,\\" and \\"St. Jimmy.\\" Overall, this is Green Day's best work to date, despite being very overplayed on the radio and MTV. This album should interest long-time Green Day fans, and people just being introduced to them.

0380733358|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It was highly entertaining. The story focuses on Henry Faber, a German spy who knows the secret to the allies victory over the Nazis. It is he alone who will or will not win the war for the Nazis. The story starts off with Faber in London, where he kills the landlady for bothering him while he was working on his secret transmitter. Faber then has to flee from London for fear of being caught. He heads up north to Scotland to look for more military activity and to rendezvous with a U-boat.  He steals a small fishing boat but gets caught in a storm. Faber's boat is destroyed and he washes up on a small island inhabited by a family. The family consists of a wife, the crippled husband, and their three year old son. The positives were that it held you on the edge of your seat with suspense and thrills. The major drawback of the book is that it took a long time for the action to start happening. Half the book was basically explaining the different characters and setting up what would happen next. I like books that dive right into the action but this was an exception. I like how Mr. Follet went into detail about how a spy thought it was interesting to see how he noticed all of his surroundings and used them to his advantage.  The characters were dynamic and they made for a good story. In short this was a great book and I recommend it for all.
B00028HBKC|4.0|This being a religious movie made it good to watch, but the ending should have been a lot better. It just ended with Jesus getting out of the grave, for goodness sakes! I didn't want to give any sort of negative comments, but the ending was really disappointing and the direction of the movie should have gone on to show more of Jesus' life after His resurrection. They should have done more, like they did on the mini-series about Christ and his resurrection that came on NBC 3 years ago during easter. Nevertheless, I thought that it was good that they were showcasing a movie about Jesus Christ and His life because the world needs to be exposed to God and religious material like this. The only thing is that it was too violent and gory; all those beatings and wipings made me jump every time it happened in the movie. I even had to cover my sister's eyes because the beating scenes were so gruesome and graphic. But it shows the length that Christ went to just to save humanity and restore redemption to a fallen world, and how important He is and should be. From the scenes in the garden of Gethsemane to His trial before Pilate, His premonition that he would be betrayed by the same disciples who swore their loyalty to the crucifixion, the movie accurately reflected biblical scripture in the life that Jesus lived. Don't pay attention to those so-called \\"anti-semetic\\" stuff because mainstream just did that divert attention and keep people from going to see the movie. The movie is good in showing Christ, and if people can go watch filthy and violent films then they can go see this one too.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was one of the most enthralling books I have read.  The buggers, the first alien race, has been found.  Ender goes to a military school and leaves his family back on earth.  Ender shows his skills and he proves to the entire school that he is the best there has ever been and probably will ever be.  The people of earth all want to be the person who goes down in history for destroying the buggers and ending their threat to mankind.   <br /> This story also evolves Ender's family, which is strange for all its own reasons.  First there is his sister Valentine.  Valentine is one of the most caring persons on the planet and loves Ender more than anyone.  Then there is Peter.  Peter is the sort of person who needs violence and loves to torture anything.  Peter hates Ender and always tries to make him feel bad.  Ender's parents broke the law to have Ender.  On an overpopulated planet with barely enough food, the world has declared that no family may have a third child.  Third children will be killed and their parents fined.  Peter and Valentine were the first two children, and both were sent to military school, and both rejected.  Ender, on the other hand, was perfect.   <br /> This novel is great for those who love games of strategy and the future.  For those, this book will be the one book they will never set down.
B000002MUW|4.0|Some people have described this as Madonna's \\"comeback\\" album after the \\"disappointment\\" of the [[ASIN:B000UOGHKS Erotica]] album.  But, both albums sold about 2 million copies in the US, so they were just about equally successful.  But, this album did produce the biggest hit of Madonna's career, \\"Take a Bow\\" (#1 for seven weeks).  It also yielded the #3 hit \\"Secret\\".  The other two single from the album, \\"Bedtime Story\\" and \\"Human Nature\\", became the first two singles by Madonna to fail to make the Top 40 since her first single (\\"Everybody\\").  This is a good album overall, and Madonna's fans should enjoy it.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|For the longest time, a friend had been trying to get me to listen to NIN.  Sure, I had heard a couple of their songs; most notably \\"Closer\\" and \\"Hurt.\\" But, I didn't truly know what NIN was, nor did I know the style of music.  It wasn't until this year with the release of With Teeth that I came to realize the crazy, methodical and perfectionistic world that was NIN.      The same friend told me that I should check out The Downward Spiral because it was, in his opinion, not only NIN's masterpiece but also a masterpiece of music in general.  Better late than never to try it out, right?  Finding this Dualdisc presentation, digitally remastered and in 5.1, I am amazed.  Talking about the disc itself, the music is crisp and if you listen to it in a 5.1 surround sound player, the songs assault your senses in a sometimes dizzying manner as sounds swing around you.  It helps push the album even further toward the \\"music to listen to\\" mode I'm always looking for.    The songs are terrific, showing Trent's questioning of various standards.  \\"Heresy\\" is funny song in that the lyrics undermine themselves.  But it also questions people's faith today and does so in a great, interesting way.  But not only are the songs dark and full of passion, they invoke different genres of music, sometimes in the same song.  I immediately was shocked and in love with \\"Ruiner\\" when the blues guitar, muffled and electric, blares in with blues licks.  I was amazed and subdued with the only ray of real light on the album, \\"A Warm Place\\" with its peaceful moments before crunching back into full strength.  I was blown away in \\"Pig\\" when the drums came blasting in at the end in the chaotic way that seemed so out of synch with the music but perfectly fit.  And \\"Hurt\\" never sounded so good.  Having only heard it on the radio a couple times (and the Man in Black's version that was overplayed), I can honestly say I heard it for the first real time here.      I'm still a new fan to NIN, coming in late tothe game.  All I've heard is With Teeth and The Downward Spiral.  But, The Downward Spiral is a masterpiece of musical talent in my opinion.  What Trent does best is take chaos and make sense of it.  Like in \\"Pig\\" with the crazy drum work that doesn't seem to fit, he makes it work.  In songs where he samples various things (women's voices etc) and incorporates them with electronica and instruments, he makes sense of chaos.  And this album shows Trent as one of the most talented people in music today.
0060958324|3.0|The book is a good read for someone who doesn't want to start reading advanced philosophies such as the Hindu (Upnishads, Vedas) or Buddhist or any other right away. It touches ideas from many other philosophies, such as the Greek and Hindu, but none of these thoughts tie together very well. The author seems to be getting into touch with something but then it all becomes incoherent after a point, and fades away. <br />One of the advantages of reading this book is the knowledge that one would gain about the relationships of various philosophers such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle. <br />But if you are looking for a REAL philosophy, this book will not take you very far. The idea of quality transcending subject and object is a very generic idea present in other philosophies. The Gita presents this idea most beautifully, building it upon the Veda and Sankhya philosophies.

0060855924|5.0|If you haven't travelled Pratchett's Discworld yet, you're not alone. Mr. Twoflowers hasn't travelled it yet, and he lives there. Feel free to join him and his reluctant guide, Rincewind, as they sample Discworld's dives, tavern brawls, dragons, assassins, pirates, and a charming assortment of near-death experiences.<br /><br />Twoflowers has the tourist's implacable confidence that every demonic temple, every hero with a magic sword, every brigand, and every catastrophe of nature was placed and scheduled for his amusement - and will hold still for a picture. He's also quite convinced that, as a tourist, he's immune to any possible harm.<br /><br />That premise give Pratchett's comic genius plenty to work with. Even Death - the Reaper himself - is just a straight man in this world. (There's also The Luggage, but I'll let you discover that for yourself.)<br /><br />This is the first book in a long-lived series, and gets it off to a great start. I have to warn you, though, there's no such thing as one Pratchett book. Even one is enough to cause addiction.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B0007P3582|3.0|This album is NOT the best rap CD. 50 Cent's debut \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" beats this album by a light year. Either 50 Cent likes to piss off his fans on purpose, or he really lost his talent! The main reason why this album is good because of its beats. I really don't like this album anymore that much. I mean, what the hell is rapping about that is worth understanding? For one thing, he's rapping about a lot wortless junk, and second his rapping sucks on this album! It sucks even worse if you compare it to his solo debut album. The only songs that I'm feeling the real 50 Cent rapping are In My Hood, I'm Supposed To Die Tonight, Candy Shop, Outta Control, Ski Mask Way, Disco Inferno, My Toy Soldier, Position Of Power, and Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix). But Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix) doesn't count because he just reused his raps from the original song on The Documentary. So basically more than half of the songs here are the fakest junk ever. If you really love his first album, his rapping here, is NOTHING like the same. If you have never bought one of his albums, i recommend \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\". If I could, I'd rate that album 6 stars. That album is way better than this. Hoenstly there is barely any effort shown in most of these songs.
B000002LK1|5.0|accessability isn't generally the kindest of terms when describing or writing about music.  'violator' is easily depeche mode's most accessible album, full of several of the most memorable moments, and arguably their most memorable single.<br /><br />'enjoy the silence' took depeche mode from darkened basement bedrooms to your suburban house-mom's kitchen. suddenly all the kids that made fun of and laughed at the black-clad mode-aphiles touted depeche mode as their favorite 'new band.' orginally a ballad and juiced up by the sadly-departed alan wilder, 'enjoy the silence' will probably always be depeche mode's signature song.  it's significantly dancier than previous singles, employing an infectious baseline and deceptively simple guitar melody. more than that, it's easily martin's most perfect melody that 15 years on still sounds incredible.<br /><br />'violator,' while generally more optimistic sounding than 'black celebration' and 'music for the masses,' feels darker in both tone and complexity. the electronic bass lines of 'world in my eyes,' 'halo,' and 'the policy of truth' sound sucked out from behind the iron curtain had it still existed when the band released the album.  of course, it doesn't hurt to have flood at the helm.<br /><br />the pefect blend of old and new mode: embracing new, more dance-oriented electronica without sacrificing the tried-and-true, somber, depeche mode ethos.

0553573403|5.0|I took this book on vacation with me in case I had a few minutes to read here and there. I ended up reading it in two and a half days! I could not put it down. This is what epic fantsy is all about. I could go on and on about how great this is, but there are so many good reviews here another rant about the brilliance of this first book of the series is unnecessary. So I leave you with these few humble statements. This book is amazing. It is the high mark of epic fantasy. It really is the total package. If you have not yet immersed yourself in the world of George R. R. Martin, do so, and you will wonder why you have waited.
6305079811|4.0|When George Lucas was about to embark on his film career, he originally wanted to do the Flash Gordan series but was unable to get the rights.  Instead he gave us Star Wars, and somehow this movie got made.  While Star Wars went on to become a beloved classic, this became one of the all time B movie classics.  When we first got cable when I was a kid this was on all the time.  I roared with laughter then and still do. <br /> <br />This isn't quite a camp classic, as it's not so-bad-its-good.  It is silly.  Are you trying to tell me those hawkmen could fly with those plastic wings on?!  I bet Timothy Dalton has his shoulders hunched in shame when someone mentions this on his resume - stiff upper lipped Shakespearian actor who even got to be James Bond for 2 movies.  Queen did the music for it, which is a pre-techno experiment still on their greatest hits packages that sounds right on.  I loved that in the beginning when the guard approaches their space shuttle and has that weapon with the gold hand!  Can't afford a Tazer gun?  Squeeze him to death with your firm handshake!  The costumes and make up are gawdy, the special effects are lame, and the acting is pretty bad.  I try to look at their faces, to see who's on the edge of laughing.  It's hard to argue with that electic wedding march as being one of the most campy things ever caught on film. <br /> <br />But this is a lot of fun.  \\"You can't crush the human spirit\\", \\"I'm a New York City girl, it's a little too quiet here for me\\" and the like are some of the hilarious deep thoughts you will ponder.  It's not Citizen Kane, have fun with it.
B00000ILDE|5.0|When Ridley Scott released the monster of \\"Alien\\" back in 1979 a new legend was formed. For 7 years fans wanted to know what happened to Ellen Ripley, and finally, in 1986, the long awaited sequel of \\"Aliens\\" was released. And may I say that it does not disappoint in the slightest! Let me explain dudes...<br /><br />\\"Alien\\" was undoubtedly a Sci-Fi horror as members of the Nostromo were killed off one by one by a hideos black \\"xenomorph.\\" Ellen Ripley is the sole survivor of the incident and escapes by entering an evacuation module and going into hyper-sleep. \\"Aliens\\" picks up over two centuries later when Ripley is awakened after being discovered by another crew and is brought back to Earth. She is soon convinced to join a group of marines in exploring a colony on Aurora-51; a planet that has been besieged by the same monstrous creatures that hunted Ripley. She soon discovers many new things about the creatures and soon finds herself battling survival with the group of marines. A pretty cool storyline I think, and for an action sci-fi it's totally suitable. 9/10 for the storyline.<br /><br />In \\"Alien\\" we believed that these aliens were solitary creatures that hunted and killed in order to survive. \\"Aliens\\" reveals that the aliens are actually creatures that live and co-exist in rather large groups, and that there are various forms of Alien: these range from the common drone, to facehuggers and larvae and a Queen that is the central hub of the hive, much like that of bees. We also learn that the Aliens work to grow and protect the hive and are extremely hostile yet surprisingly intelligent creatures.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is 100% correct, but the concept of the \\"Dropship\\" seems to have been introduced by \\"Aliens.\\" I haven't seen dropships in earlier movies, so this seems to be one of the very innovative and new ideas that \\"Aliens\\" brought to the genre of Sci-Fi. The Marines also have weapons that are more practically orientated and are believably futuristic. Using laser guns would've made this movie lame, and James Cameron has chosen to maintain the gritty and dark atmosphere of \\"Alien\\" through these advanced projectile weapons. The Smartgun makes its first appearance in this film, along with the Pulse Rifle. Smartguns are able to track and \\"lock\\" onto targets and also have advanced target-friend recognition technology. The uniforms of the marines are also very futuristic and also have a practical feel. Aurora-51 is also an extremely dark planet with a naturally hostile atmosphere (Weyland-Yutani developed \\"Atmosphere Processors\\" to convert hazardous gas-chemicals to breathable air  in order for humans to exist on this planet).<br /><br />The Aliens are kept strongly to the original design and the Queen is a very impressive specimen. The Alien Hive seems to almost live and breathe and appear just as slimy and disgusting as the aliens themselves. Cameron shows his genius as a director by keeping action realistic (in most cases) and his creation of mood and atmosphere through landscapes, lighting, characters, weapons and storyline. You really have to see \\"Aliens\\" to truly understand how truly revolutionary and incredible it is.<br /><br />The movie is a refreshing Sci-Fi Action that is extremely innovative, dark and creative. Cameron has successfully expanded on the \\"Alien\\" franchise and has made a truly interesting and exciting movie. The conflict between Ripley and The Queen near the end is certainly a highlight. Nice to see to overzealous females trying to kick the crap out of each other. What kind of action is better, honestly? And to the guy who found this boring - either you get high on some s*** very often or you are far from a Sci-Fi fan. \\"Aliens\\" is a classic that joins the ranks of \\"Alien\\" as a classic Sci-Fi movie. And anybody who wants to dispute that may want to watch out for fans - we're everywhere, and you never know when we may latch onto your face and plant eggs in your body...<br /><br />\\"Aliens\\" gets a full 100% in my book. Today the storyline may not be highly original, but the creation of atmospheres, action, good acting, tension and creativity makes \\"Aliens\\" a true Sci-Fi Giant. So rent it or buy it, but it's essential watching for any good \\"Alien\\" fan and Sci-Fi fans alike. Now stop reading and go watch! BUY NOW! REGRET NEVER!>\\"Aliens\\" gets a full 100% in my book.

B00020X88O|4.0|I don't even want to guess how many words have been written about this movie.  This movie was two steps from the gutter and yet it was hyped to be the greatest, most moving, almost a religious experience.  But it achieved a success when other flop movies fail to break even, securing it's place in history as a camp classic.  Elizabeth Berkely plays a not too bright hitchhiker named Nomi who comes to Las Vegas with nothing but her dream of becoming a dancer / showgirl.  She shacks up with an earnest, well meaning seamstress named Molly (who was the one and only genuine character in this movie) who works at one of the big Vegas hotels in wardrobe for their entertainment department.  While she's sewing, Nomi goes from being a stripper to being a showgirl, and from there it all goes downhill.  It seems she only got the job thanks to the wants of the lead who is trying to get her in the sack at all times, and eventually Nomi secures her position by preforming for the entertainment director.  Really, did anyone think that a movie about a dimwitted drifter who comes to Vegas to be a dancer / stripper was going to be Ben Hur?  Did anyone think that she was going to live happily ever after even if she did achieve the fame she was seeking in that facet of entertainment?  The answer is no, and it was clearly no from the start.  The gal was a skank without direction when she got there (and her lips! *shudder*), and became a sort of cleaned up skank without direction when she left.  Exactly what makes this or any other movie camp?  There are many layers.  It was a combination of factors here.  It's the seriousness of all participants to make art when it turns out to be drivel.  The flash and glitz of sets reveals the obvious production costs that were lost.  But what really made this a camp sensation was Elizabeth Berkely in the lead role.  As she was on another campy show, Saved By The Bell, for so many years it was with a creepy interest that we all turned to her like that galon the soapbox who started in Behind The Green Door.  Having come from a G rated show for kids (as it was on the Saturday morning cartoon line up) and playing a sort of feminist icon for the junior hich school set, it was quite shocking that she wanted to depart so badly from that image that she would take the role the polar opposite of what she was most known for.  She's not a bad actress, but she played her character the same as she did on Saved By The Bell.  We just can't help but look for glimmers of the smart, wannabe sophisticate she was then, and see a scabbie riden, moneymaker shaking stripper in her place.  They should make a sequel of her joining the Peace Corp going to feed starving children in Asia.  Now that I would pay to see!
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|I'm not going to tell you not to buy this album as everyone has a different taste in music,  I'm simply going to tell you what to expect.   <br /> <br />I remember when I first heard their debut album... I was drawn into the band's completely original style.  They played metal without sounding metal.  They played space rock without diving into the realm of incomprehension.  They were different, which is more than every band coming out of the genre could say, and although they were extremely catchy, 30 Seconds To Mars still played intelligent music: original song arrangements, complex drum patterns, and certainly a unique vocalistic style from Jared Leto.  You felt both refreshed and relieved after listening to the album, knowing that someone playing rock was still trying to be an innovator. <br /> <br />So with high expectations, I popped their new album into my cd player Wednesday night.  Twenty minutes later I found myself listening to their old album again, in order to convince myself I wasn't insane for buying the new one.  Everything that made the first album so interesting and refreshing is missing from \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\"  Leto seems to have lost his taste for experimentation and in effect every song sounds bland and generic, lacking any sort of originality.  Such surprises as the acoustic leadin to the chorus of \\"Edge Of The Earth,\\" the syncopated percussion of \\"Echelon\\"'s intro, the deeply inbedded gasps and yelps of \\"The Mission\\" that made that song so fun to listen to and the sprawling outro of \\"Year Zero\\" that leaves you yearning for more even after two minutes of the same lyrics, are all gone.  All that's to be found are uninteresting drum rhythms, played out guitar patterns, and generic song structures.  As sad as it is for me to say this, 30 Seconds To Mars can now be clumped in with all the Nicklebacks and Puddle of Mudds.  \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is just simply not an engaging listen.   <br /> <br />So my advice to the reader: If you liked \\"30 Seconds To Mars\\" for it's unique sound and originality, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM (well ok, maybe I will say it.)  You will be disappointed I promise.  However, if your a fan of bands such as Seether and Nickleback, you might actually enjoy this album and I do not want to discourage you from buying it.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Band of Brothers Unfortunately Still Glorifies War - Having seen it through again I love the documentary style, but then I realized I was being deceived. It still glorifies war for those who survive. They want Winters to get an even bigger medal than he already got. Giving medals for killing people has got to be looked at. I don't deny the hell those men went through, and how terrible Hitler and the German army were, but in this picture the Germans are pictured unrealistically. The German officer is allowed to keep his sidearm, his gun? Come on. I have read the real story by a Jewish resistance fighter and they knew for a fact how the German officers bragged about the number of Jews they had killed with their hand guns. You cannot believe the atrocities committed by German officers and men. BofB gives the impression that German soldiers were just doing their duty like American soldiers. There is the surrender speech of a German officer to show his men are just like the American men, a band of brothers. So I don't get that this movie is realistic as to what the Germans were like under Hitler and Nazism. Also, we hear only about the old soldiers who made it in civilian life, but where is Guarnere, the guy who had his leg blown off? Where are the others who survived but are casualties of war in civilian life? Did I miss Guarnere's old age story? I hate to think what the effect of this movie is on young men who might want a war to fight in and survive in. Seems like the film is saying, we can't glorify the Viet Nam War but we can glorify the Second World War. All Quiet On The Western Front is still the best war movie, to my mind, because it shows the realism of the soldiers' minds and not just the action. The big question still is, what in the human psyche makes people go to war and kill each other? What happens to all the young soldiers that simply are not good killers, that are not mentally equipped to kill other human beings? They lost a lot of replacements in Easy Company, but did they ever say it in the film that most of these victims maybe were not cut out to kill other human beings? Did they say that  these easily dead in war might be the best sort of human beings? War is hell, but are there any war films yet that show the hell that is war? I hope teachers and parents and friends will help people see that Band of Brothers has its difficult issues, as well as its tough but good character points. Killing is still killing, no matter how you portray it. To be truly realistic in war you have to show men's minds. The educated men in this film were laughed at. Can you believe it? No talk from them whatsoever! Who wrote this film anyway? Who directed it, produced it, and what was the point?ompany, but did they ever say it in the film that most of these victims maybe were not cut out to kill other human beings?

0385510454|5.0|I'm ordinarily not a big fan of espionage thrillers, but that said, I<br /><br />enjoyed John Grisham's latest book: THE BROKER . . . like many<br /><br />of his books, a lawyer (Joel Backman) is the main character--but this<br /><br />one no longer practices the profession . . . in fact, he has spent the<br /><br />last six years in a federal prison and only gets out as the result<br /><br />of pardon by the President.<br /><br />Backman winds up in Italy where he finds himself in hiding from the<br /><br />Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis . . . he manages<br /><br />to escape them all by learning Italian and immersing himself into that<br /><br />country's culture, a task that I actually found myself relating to<br /><br />because of Grisham's fine writing . . . it was almost as if I could feel<br /><br />what the onetime lawyer was going through.<br /><br />The book kept my interest until the very end--always a good sign . . . also,<br /><br />I appreciated the fact that the author just didn't rely on what has worked<br /><br />for him in the past; i.e., he tried something different and, as a result,<br /><br />it didn't feel like I was reading the \\"same old Grisham\\" just recycled.
0316172324|5.0|I have long believed that we need to trust our \\"gut feelings\\" about situations and people. This is now described and spelled out in a book - BLINK.  A gut feeling has to do with instant recognition about something. It also has to do with your mind's ability to call up experiences on the spot as you confront a new experience or situation or person. BLINK affirms and ratifies those recognitions and judgments. The book details many interesting scenarios regarding this ability that we all possess and need to trust.  Lynne Coates, retired teacher

0895260131|5.0|Everything you wanted to know about Islam and the Crusades but won't learn in school! Well almost anyway.  Spencer once again makes clear the simple truth about a truly evil enterprise - Islam as it practiced as a cult of death, hate, and murder.  He also highlights that we should not be ashamed of Western civilization's past and if not for us, we may still be in the dark ages of humanity. He is one of the few people not willing to give Islam a free pass and to demand accountability for itself and it's role in everything from the Crusades to WWII and the holocaust to the 20+ major conflicts in the world today that involve muslims as major combatants and agitators.  Arm yourself with knowledge.  This book is a great companion to The Life and Religion of Mohammed by Fr. J.L. Menezes.

B000002UDG|5.0|Like John Lennon, Paul Mccartney was great both with and without The Beatles. On his own, he created one of the greatest rock albums of the 1970s' (\\"Band Of The Run\\") and had an endless run of hit singles. In 1990, the single disc best of collection \\"All The Best\\" was released. It contained 17 songs from McCartney's solo career (well, mostly with Wings). 15 years later, the more comprehensive Wingspan was released. How does \\"All The Best Hold Up\\"? Read on for the postivies and the negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-If you're a casual McCartney only interested in owning one of his albums, than this collection is a good choice. Almost all the hits msot radio fans are familliar with are here, including \\"Band On The Run\\", \\"Live And Let Die\\", \\"Say, Say, Say\\" (with Michael Jackson), \\"Ebony And Ivory\\" (with Stevie Wonder), \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\" and \\"My Love\\".<br /><br />-\\"C Moon\\" is a rare track only available as B - side.<br /><br />-The booklet contains lyrics and some great pictures.<br /><br />-The tracks sound great.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-Where's \\"Maybe I'mm Amazed\\"? That omission is inexcusable.<br /><br />-While we're on the subject of omissions, where's \\"Take It Away\\", \\"Spies Like Us\\", \\"Venus & Mars Rock Show\\", \\"Girls School\\", \\"Mull Of Kentyre\\" (spell check please), \\"Picasso's Last Words\\" and \\"Press\\", to name a few?<br /><br />-\\"Wingspan\\" is much more comprehensive than this collection.<br /><br />Despite these glaring negatives, this is still the best collection for the casual fan who doesn't want too spend too much money on the two cd \\"Wingspan\\".
B000000OU4|5.0|I own about 10 Pat Metheny albums, and I enjoy all of them alot. That said, this album has always stood out as my personal favorite. It includes some of Methenys best work as a guitarist, and as a composer. I really cannot fathom all the negative reviews this album is getting...  <br /> <br />This is a unique Metheny album, unlike most others. It contains rhythms that trace back to Pop and Rock. \\"To the End of the World\\" is the real standout track on this album, an epic 12 minute piece with varying themes and rhythms. It stands out among Methenys superior compisitions. \\"We Live Here\\" features a tribal element, proving the bands boundaries and limitations are endless and nonexistant. <br /> <br />The band, Lyle Mays - keyboards, Steve Rodby - bass, Paul Wertico - drums, and of course Pat Metheny on guitar, are all on top creative form on this album. Great album to own if you are looking so see what all the hype over Metheny is about, or if you have a hankering for some good Jazz/Fusion.
0312323859|4.0|I check out both \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\" from the local library at the same time, so I ended up reading both of them in one day, back-to-back.<br /><br />I thought that \\"Something Blue\\" was a better book than \\"Something Borrowed\\".<br /><br />\\"Something Blue\\" picks up right where \\"Something Borrowed\\" left off. In fact, there is a bit of an overlap, with Darcy discussing her point of view on the events in the last chapters of \\"Something Borrowed.\\" I loved Darcy's character, and felt that she wasn't treated very right in the first book, so it felt good to get validation for her character in this book.<br /><br />The problem is that you have to wait a long time for the validation.  The whole first half book was very long and Darcy pretty much acts the same way she is portrayed in \\"Something Borrowed.\\" She's manipulative, a user, narcissistic, shallow and, generally, a horrible person. Her obsession with Rachel and Dex gets very tiring (which is what the author is trying to show, I know, but still hard to digest.) It was almost as if the author was scared of just jumping in with a difference of opinion on the events of the past book because it would make her first characters (Rachel and Dex) look bad and she didn't want to do that. Which is too bad, because it made the characters of THIS book look horrible for whole first half of the book.<br /><br />Then, in the middle of the book, Darcy's character makes an abrupt about-face. Based on one lecture from an old high school friend (and a follow-up kick to her tummy from her unborn baby) Darcy wakes up to a \\"new and improved\\" version of Darcy, and the second half of the book has her being a completely different person. A person that is lovable and kind.  It was a very abrupt change, and that threw things off for me.  I'm not saying that we had to change her character from the first book (I realize continuity is important) but I do think that change should have been more gradual.<br /><br />The best part about the book is the relationship between Darcy and Ethan. Hands down, he is my favorite character from both books. I loved him in \\"Something Borrowed\\" and I'm glad that he was such a prominent part of this book.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this book was WAY better than the first one, and mostly that was due the characters. I could actually root for Darcy and Ethan in this one, whereas in the last one, I didn't want Rachel and Dex to work out. Darcy and Ethan were more sympathetic and I loved the ending. It was perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, I would really recommend this book.  I would recommend that a person to read \\"Something Borrowed\\" before reading this, because I think that you can't get the whole picture unless you read both of them.The best part about the book is the relationship between Darcy and Ethan.

B0009XT8YW|5.0|To think 25 years has past since this great album was orginally released doesn't seem possible.  The sound is incredible!  The DVD side is so much fun, as well!  The interview with Barbra and Barry is short but still full of timeless moments.  Plus for the first time on DVD one gets to dive into Barbra and Barry's once in a life time performances from the \\"One Voice\\" concert!  Then enjoy the preview of Guilty Pleasures with \\"Stranger in A Strange Land\\".  Guilty is a classic work that with this dualdisc is even better than before.  From where this fan sits, he plans on being Guilty Forever!
B000A3DFZE|2.0|this is not the usual ec album.  its all pop music except for one track.  there are no good guitar solos.  Its all really happy.  for the blues fan i would highly recomend that you do not listen to this album.  if your a pop fan then you will probaly like this because you like crappy music.   <br />this is a horrible cd and whoever told mr. clapton that it was good should be punched in the face.
B000002IR7|2.0|Despite the magic of the title tune, this album shows signs of having been rushed out as a cash-in. The choice of material is poor, and the interpretations are somewhat uncertain. If you must own 'Green Onions' (the tune), get it on a compilation, and spend your Booker T & the MGs budget on one of the later albums (which are utterly brilliant...).
B00082IJ08|5.0|While their debut album back in 2001 was considered a doubtless hit and deemed them The Most Successful Virtual Band, it is the second album by Gorillaz, tiled \\" Demon Days \\", that has made the world recognize them and given the band the popularity they deserve. Much darker than the previous, Demon Days is like Pink Floyd mixed with techno sounds, and rap music/ artists. The first 6 songs are, by themselves, all hits. From the Intro / Last Living Souls, to Kids With Guns, to O Green World, to finally Dirty Harry, and of course, Feel Good, Inc., which won the MTV 2005 Award for best breakthrough music video. Songs 7-10 are ok, but nothing special. Just filler. But song 11, DARE, is an enjoyable hit that recently got it's own music video. Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head, the 12th song, is a narraration by Dennis Hopper, is the dark story of the Happy Folk and a volcano killing them due to greed. The album finally draws to an end with Don't Get Lost In Heaven and Demon Days, narrarated by a choir. There you have it! Demon Days. The 2nd album by Gorillaz, which is not only a hit, but a masterpiece.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|In a time when alternative metal is dying, System of a Down are the brightest of the few breaths of fresh air in that genre. In fact, the band shouldn't even be classified as they have got their own style, which they triumphantly prove with Mesmerize. <br /> <br />SOAD are by far the most creative and melodic metal band today and they continue to furhter push their musical boundaries. They are muscular, witty, modern, deep, bombastic, intelligent, soulful and cathartic at the same time. Their balance between depth and headbanging reminds Tool's earlier records. And unlike Tool, they manage to pack it into 2-3 minute songs with absolutely no wasted time. The whole album lasts only 36 minutes, but it is just enough - you will get enough impressions and have a feeling of a whole piece of music. <br /> <br />Lyrically, SOAD continue to explore their anti-corporative-America and antiwar views, but alsotouch upon some eternal filosophical problems which is trademark SOAD. What makes the album unique even for this band is the use of vocal harmonies between Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian in almost every song. At times you wold think that Serj had better sung alone, but they are compensated by some terrific moments on tracks 1, 3, 9 and Malakian-sung closer Lost in Hollywood is just as venomous as Rage Against The Machine song while also being lyrical and harmonious. <br /> <br />The production is a step forward from the first two albums; it is so clear and sharp that you can hear every instrument which means you will dicsover more unnoticed details with each consecutive listen. <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side - Intro. This is a harmonious and sad intro to the SOAD's vision of modern world. Eastern-tinged and ehereally beautiful. <br />2. B.Y.O.B. This song kicks ass... A dope phrase, I know, but it's so powerful, explosive, operatic, melodic and entertaining at the same time. What's more, it also manages to melt numerous riffs, melodies and rhythms into one cohesive and expressive whole. <br />3. Revenga. A solid song which has perhaps the best bridge on the album. Daron's vocals are so emotive!... <br />4. Cigaro. This 2-minute masterpiece has got everything... The best funny song SOAD have written so far. <br />5. Radio/Video. An Armenian-tinged track which results in its cool melody. An explosive chorus and a cool solo towards the end make this another highlight. <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song. Great riffs, superb singing in Serj's style. This is a chaotic track in the vein of Jet Pilot. <br />7. Violent Pornography. Overall, a strong track, but not one of my favourites. <br />8. Question! This is the most operatic song on Mesmerize which means you'll be thrilled by quiet verse/emotive chorus/speedy climax of this song. THIS IS MUSIC. <br />9. Sad Statue. One of my favourites, features awesome polyphonic vocal interplay between Serj and Daron in the verses and a truly epic chorus. <br />10. Old School Hollywood. The use of keyboard effects reveals that SOAD are not Radiohead, but it works to create an empty and pretentious atmosphere - this song is about 'old school Hollywood baseball' ;))) <br />11. Lost In Hollywood. The calmest song on the album, which is melodic and turns almost gothic towards the end. The lyrics sum up the overall topic of the album well.   <br /> <br />Comparing Mesmerize to Toxicity, I should say that it's hard decide which is better as both are awfully strong. While Toxity seems slightly more sprawling and classical alternative metal, Mesmerize is more a whole piece of art and definitely a quintessential SOAD album. Buy this; I recommend this to EVERY person unless he hates hard music. It is and will probably remain this year's best. <br />

B00004XONN|5.0|About 2000 reviews for Radiohead's fourth album and a follow-up to 'OK Computer' - 'Kid A' prove that the band and this recording especially are controversial. And this is a good case, moreover, rightfully so. A truly unique album that is one of the band's best. <br /> <br />What makes 'Kid A' special is the fact that it was the first, and perhaps the most focused fusion of rock and electronica by Radiohead. The first three albums were real progressions from each other and by hte release of 'OK Computer' the band had created an almost perfect record in the genre of alternative guitar rock. They had to take a new direction, and they did it with samples, beats and weird song structures.  <br /> <br />The style alone is of course no big thing, but combined with the quality of the album it achieves a great result. Not as melodic and harder to get into than 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer', the music here is deep, touching and inventive. In fact, 'Kid A's soundscapes could be even more expressive than on 'OKC' if you really get into them. There are occasional guitar songs - Optimistic, In Limbo - but the album as a whole seems different from Radiohead's earlier work. <br /> <br />And yes - 'Kid A' is really a WHOLE, a true blow to your mind. The lyrics, the music and even the booklet art melt together, making this a fully realized piece of art, a terrifying picture of our modern world and what it does to thinking people.  <br /> <br />There are not many albums like this in history. I hope you enjoy it and it helps you discover something new in life.

He identifies six essential aptitudes needed for the future: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning. These can be used to organize, explain, and move forward with the data gathered in typical left-brain activites.  Since many people can be trained to do analytical data collection and analysis, it will be the people who can take that information to the next level by using creative problem solving and original designs who will succeed in the future.
B000002UR7|3.0|Radiohead's first album is generally considered immature and their worst, at least by fans of their later work. It also has the lowest sales rank on Amazon, so you could really start doubting about the quality of this recording. <br /> <br />And - strange to say this about Radiohead - it is a subpar offering by band's standards and an average album overall. At that time Radiohead were not unique - they played generic guitar Britpop with some U2 influences that were yet to be fully realized and integrated into their sound - nor did they have accomplished songwriting which results in the album's inconsistence.  <br /> <br />The lack melody and sometimes indulge in unexpressive instrumental sections (Stop Whispering, I Can't) that seem to be nothing but unnecessary noise. Tom's lyrics are not as sharp and original as expected; in fact, they are generic like the album's sonic palette. <br /> <br />What luckily saves Pablo Honey LP are its highlight songs: Creep, Radiohead's first hit that became a clichee for the band; Anyone Can Play Guitar, a grungey but uplifting gem and Blow Out - a haunting dynamic jam that established the tradition of strong album closers. Other songs worth mentioning include You, Thinking About you and Vegetable. <br /> <br />I would recommend this album for the fans of early-ninetees guitar rock and of course to the Radiohead fans looking to comlplete their collection. Others should first check 'The Bends', 'OK Computer' or 'Kid A'.

B000A3DFZE|4.0|On the over-produced Pilgrim, it seemed that Clapton had lost touch with what made him such a compelling musician. He must have felt this, and in the last seven years has delivered music that brings him back home, indeed. Reptile is a fantastic re-telling of his own back catalog. The Robert Johnson sets returned Eric to his roots and reminded him what great songwriting sounds like. Back Home is Eric Clapton at his best. There will be those who never will forgive EC for leaving Mayall's band, much less Cream, and haven't given any validity to his work since 461 Ocean Blvd. provided the template for the rest of EC's career. They will hate this CD, just as they hated Reptile, Pilgrim, Journeyman, etc.<br /><br />Back Home is full of warm lyrics set to upbeat melodies. Every once in a while, EC lets loose with a signature lick, riff or solo. So Tired is a funny take on family life; anyone who has kids will instantly relate. Musically, the songs are just as easy-going as a summer afternoon. You'll be humming along before you know it.<br /><br />My advice to those who will be disappointed that there is not a Crossroads XXV on the disc - grow up. EC has, and he shows maturity and an appreciation for the truly important things in life on Back Home.

Their voices are so crisp and clear, it is real nice. You get some singers that have such strong accents you can't even understand them.  <br /> <br />I do like Enya's version of May It Be from LOTR better then the one on this CD, but it is still very pretty.  <br /> <br />You Raise Me Up: first of all I love that song, but I like Josh Groban's version better. I guess it is the masculine voice and his absolutely wonderful gospel choir. <br /> <br />All in all this CD is a true piece of art. <br /> <br />The song \\"Send Me A Song\\" sung by Lisa Kelly, is one of my favorites, another is Walking in the Air, sung by Chloe Agnew.

0517221160|5.0|I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman.  I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again.  What a classic!  This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female.  The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March.  It is a story of hope and love.  This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters.  There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly.  Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters.  There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service.  Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners.  A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.<br />Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking.  I was a little hesitant to buy this online.  I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail.  It is nicely bound.  The cover is hardcover cloth.  The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\".  It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf.  I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!

You have absolutely no taste at all in music! You all who diss this band and album think you know what metal is; well, you really don't. If you don't like them, then don't post a review trying to tear them down! <br />Overall, this is a great album. The guitars and drums are fast and awesome. Randy Blythe's voice is made for metal. The lyrics to the songs are meaningful too. THIS IS PURE AMERICAN METAL!
B000AADYYO|2.0|I would have thought after the release Of Damnation they would have stayed in that mode of intense vocal feeling. Instead they went back to their old worn out Metal screaming vocal. Ghost Reveries is just plain horrible. Opeth had the feeling and melody with Damnation and that is where they should have stayed.
0893860220|5.0|This is a most beautiful, simple, delightful book. It's inspirational. It's the truth. Read it.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Like many others, i heard his songs on the radio, got the CD and expected most of the CD to be crap.  I honestly like every single song on the CD and have been hooked on it for months!  I would recomment this CD to anyone and everyone, it's to good not to give it a listen at least once.
1577314808|5.0|I have read this book 5 times now.  The second time I decided to highlight the important points, and I ended up highlighting the entire book almost :-)  I am so glad I found this book.  Life is now much more livable, I feel at one with the universe, and all is well.  This is one of those books where I feel lucky to have been born this late in history so Tolle could be born and I could read what he has to say.
B000AM4PBS|4.0|The limited edition Friends-The Series Finale DVD claimed to be the only place to get the broadcast version of the final episode.  Will it appear differently on this dvd?
1593072937|4.0|This graphic novel punched me in the face! It was relatively short. Shorter on the dialogue but I can sure see why they made a movie about it. The graphic style of the book really accomplishes an artistic minimalism that makes this graphic novel a stand out. Purchasers of this will gain a rip roaring yarn that grabs them by the throat and never lets go.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I Really Hate this album and this band, they remind me of the rap rock version of G-Unot, this album is incredibly awful, the lyrics are terrible, the drumming is terrible and everything else is terrible as well, I Blame Nerdvana for bringing this whine rock genre in and destroying music like this, and this band is the perfect example of that. <br /> <br />Chocolate Starfish & The Hot Dog Flavored Water is a stupid sloppy mess <br /> <br />Nu Metal is even worse than boy bands and hair bands (at least they can play instruments unlike nu metal b.s.) <br /> <br />Limp Bizkit and G-Unot sucks <br /> <br />F*ck Fred Durst & 50 Cent. <br />
0316172324|3.0|This book is a ten ton hornet's nest dropped smack dab in a city full of people allergic to hornets. The book starts out good. There's some bit about a statue. I never get a really good fix on what's happening in Blink. I recommend this book only for readers who have the time to delve into a really good story without needing excitement every page. All in all, except for a few missteps, this rip roaring yarn delivers the goods.
0679805273|5.0|I gave each one of my cousins this book for high school and college graduations. Both loved it and the story tells it like it is. Even their parents loved reading it. It was a perfect little extra gift from my two year old daughter to them.
B00005JNEI|3.0|The problem with this DVD is nutcase lefties will praise this as if it's a smoking gun whilst right wingnuts will scream treason. It's neither.  <br /> <br />Entertaining? Yes. But don't depend on Moore to give you an unbiased documentary.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|id hate to say it but i will, this is a \\"decent\\" album.  i am a really big clapton fan and it hurts to say that.  i guess if you are looking for another from the cradle or journey man, you wont find it in this album. this blues man has aged and so has this taste, this album shows he has matured. i went on release day to grab this album and i enjoyed listening to it, but i still love the classics and this cd will probably not get as much play in my cd player...if you love clapton and his ever changing ways then i say snatch this album up but if you are looking for his earlier days of classic rock or blues, you will only find traces...
B000A3DFZE|1.0|OK first of all, I am a HUGE clapton fan. I have most of the records, seen him a ton of times and was excited when this CD came in the mail. After listening half way thru I was very upset.  The music is GARBAGE. I mean how can you go from the Cream Reunion and Sessions for Robert J to this Smooth Jazz pile of rubble.  Not even guest shots from Winwood and Robert Randolph can help this thing out. Clapton scatting isn't my idea of a good idea. <br /> <br />I will say \\"Revolution\\" is a great song, if the whole record had more of that vibe it would have been a good addition. In my opinion this is worse than Pligrim. <br /> <br />Thanks to simon climie for screwing up clapton's career.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|\\"City of Evil\\" by Avenged Sevenfold is by far one of the most unique metal albums of the year. Depending on whether you're an old fan of the band or a new comer to them, you may find the vocals on the album a little uncomfortable at first, but once Shadows voice sinks in, you'll see what an achievement this cd is.  <br /> <br />The instrumentals on this album are absolutley incredible. The Drumming has gotten a lot more creative and fast paced, and the Rev tears it up each and every song, and in their genre, the guitarists have to be some of the most talented guys in around these days.  <br /> <br />The first half of this album feels like the more catchy and upbeat part of the album. With parts like the powerful feeling of \\"The Beast and the Harlot\\", the fast paced intro to \\"Burn it Down\\", and the insane solo to \\"Bat Country\\", you'll find yourself listening to these tracks constantly. \\"Seize the Day\\" is the very calm and very deep halfway point of the album, setting the tone perfectly for the second half, where the band just unleashes hell. \\"Sidewinder\\" has one of the most impressive acoustic outros of any song by a modern day band, and just makes you listen in awe as the guitarists play away. \\"Wicked\\" perfectly describes the song \\"The Wicked End\\" as it starts and ends with intensity, with such an amazing bridge, with a sort of Edward Scissorhands feel to it. The western-like intro to \\"Strength of the World\\" is really not something you hear from bands nowadays, and it's a shame. The next song, \\"Betrayed\\" is based on Dimebag Darrell and his death, and the lyrics put into the song are both heavy and  beautiful, as is the music played with them. \\"M.I.A\\" is a great closing song with great guitar, and is a perfect reason while this album needs to be heard from beginning to end. <br /> <br />This album isn't five stars for no reason at all. Although some songs may take time to warm up to, every track is truly great. their was a lot of negativity towards this album, due tothe lack of screaming. If you really listen to the album, you can't honestly say that screams belong in any of the songs. Every track is as it should be. Avenged Sevenfold has done what no other band in their genre would even consider to do, and they have created a masterpeice in the process. This band has been brimming with talent ever since their first album, and now they have mastered their craft. \\"City of Evil\\" is a must have album.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I ordered this product after checking out the same item at other stores and this was by FAR the lowest price anywhere!! <br />The quality was also great...I received it in perfect condition and in good time! <br />I would reccommend AMAZON to purchase items to anyone!! <br />
B000002J0P|5.0|Back in 1969, my friend Ed (always ahead of the curve when it comes to new music) pointed to the overhead speaker in the student cafeteria and said, \\"Track of the year.\\" The college radio station was playing Judy Blue Eyes. I stopped, gave a listen and skipped lunch so I would have money to buy the album on the way home (no plastic back then.)  I still have the record and I also have the CD. This record helped me through long hours studying for Dr. Peg's Organic Chem class.  I just put the headphones on and shut out the world, calmed by some of rock's finest voices, inspired guitar playing and that sweet, sweet harmony. So much rock music has come and gone since '69 - some of it good, some of it flat out dreck, but there are few if any records as musically involvng as CSN's first. This is a classic that belongs in every rock collection. Make sure to listen to the words - they are simple and simply amazing.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I've watched the Eagles for 30 years and this is just a wonderful take on their live performances. Joe Walsh rules the show with his wry faces, sense of humor and usual wonderfully tasteful guitar licks. His new song \\"One Day At A Time\\" is great! Long live the Eagles.<br /><br />David Beasley
B0002IVN9W|4.0|It's hard to explain how endearing this album is, or to understand how it has managed to stay in my CD player almost nonstop for so long.   The pieces don't add up to the whole.  It ought to come across and maudlin, overemotional, manipulative.  It's over the top like there never was a top.  Not an ounce of restraint is shown at any moment from track 1 to the end.  This should add up to disaster.  And yet...  <br /> <br />Endearing is the word for it.  Like the gangly youngster who knock over your lamp and then kicks the crap out of your coffee table in his panic to fix the lamp, you love him not just in spite of his lack of grace, but actually because of his lack of grace.  He's so ugly he's beautiful.  So is this music.  It's sweet, and loud, and outright bawls from time to time, and I just can't stop listening to it.    <br /> <br />Maybe we're finally getting tired of irony.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Eric Clapton is quite a guitarist. His new album is real solid. Great songs to sing along too. \\"I'm Going Left\\" is one of his songs that is a big sing along song. Before this album was released, \\"One Track Mind\\" and \\"Revolution\\" was released on Itunes as singles. If you like Eric Clapton, I would say to get this album.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I swear...\\"I will follow you into the dark\\" is going to be my wedding song...you cant beat the creative lyricism of Ben Gibbard and the way the words and music come together to make an awesome album.
B00005JODA|5.0|Fernando Meirelles Adaptation of the John Le Carre novel \\" The Constant Garner\\" is a taste of perfection with two great performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes who both breath life into this breathtaking thriller about a corrupt pharmaceutical company who are conducting illegal experimentation's on the people of a tribal village in Africa. Rachel Weisz plays Tessa Qualye, a human rights activist who stumbles upon this conspiracy and tries to champion the rights of the tribesmen but when she is killed, Her husband Justin comes out of his protective shell to find her killers and to figure out the extend of this conspiracy. Fernando Meirelles gives this nail bitter a realistic edged that puts you right in the middle of the action and gives you a kind of photographic beauty that makes the landscape of the African nation a sight to behold. The acting is a compliment to the direction with Rachel Weisz proving once again to be an uncanny actress with incredible range. She solidifies herself as one of the most powerful actors of her generation with a supercharge performance that deserves all the praise it has been getting. Ralph Fiennes proves as well to be one of the most talented actors around with a performance that is complex and thought provoking and it has several cracks beneath the surface once you really get into the movie. <br /> <br />This is one great film and with such a lackluster summer full of real crap, this is a real gem to behold <br />
0143034901|5.0|This book is one that should be read by all who love a story of intrigue, love, and honor.  The novel takes you back as if you were a character and are caught in the whirlwind of storytelling and the art of books.  You begin to empathize and measure your life and yourself against those of the characters...  A must read!  You will fall in love with Carlos Ruiz Zafon!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz but not even her effort could have saved this extreamly bad film. Keanu Reeves should be put in jail for his horrible performance and the director should never direct again for his lack of directional skills.    Avoiud like the pluge.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|This is the best piece of work you have ever put out...and I have been listening to your music good and bad since 1969! Tasty guitar chops and music with a groove.....
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review on anything, so I guess that tells you something about my feelings for this film. <br /> <br />No doubt, some of my love for this movie is due to the fact that this film introduced me to Kris Kristofferson.  Like MANY women who saw this film (though, at 13 years old, I'm not sure I had quite earned the title of \\"woman\\" yet when I first saw it), I fell in lust with Kris in this film.  I went on to become much more a fan of his songwriting than his acting, but I do feel this still rates as one of his best performances.  In fact, I would rate this and his performance in \\"Trouble In Mind\\" as my two favorites of his long acting career, and I've seen almost all of them.  I feel it is Kris' portrayal of John Norman Howard and this film's stronger development of the male lead (as opposed to the strong focus on the female lead in the previous 2 film versions) that make this film the most powerful of the three.  In the two earler film versions, I didn't feel that I knew the male character well enough to really care about him when he died.  In this film, I cried at the end every time for the first...o.k., I'm not sure how many times.  Grant it, I'm a sucker for a good romance, and this rates as a great one in my book.   <br /> <br />Yes, it would probably make the top ten in my favorite \\"chick flicks\\", but it has more depth & merit than that.  Kris & Barbra's performances are both flawless in my book and, contrary to the opinion of other reviewers, I think the music from both is powerful.  Anyone who knows Kris' own music knows this music is as far from his own as one could get.  But, I saw this movie before I knew Kris or his music, and I loved it all!  In fact, I think Kris makes a great Rock Star; though,knowing his songwriting now, I certainly prefer his own writing. <br /> <br />Streisand is certainly always a killer in the music/vocal department, and the story is no different here. The chemistry between her & Kris is redhot, and there's a tenderness & sensitivity to their relationship on screen that is palpable.   <br /> <br />For a fan of either of these two stars, or anyone just looking for a good romantic drama or some great music and powerful performances, this one is a must!!! Can't wait to finally have it on DVD! <br /> <br />Jana S.
B00003CXDD|4.0|Truly a grand adventure from two masters of film.  For it's time, the morphing effects were mesmerizing, and the wonderful cast helped make it all believable.  While it might be a bit scary at times for the little ones, this is a good family film.  How can you miss with Wizards and magic, an Evil Queen, a valiant hero or two and a love story to boot?
B00006SFBD|5.0|Deliverance is  the album that introduced Opeth to me. It occured then to me that I've lost many precious years and I wanted to make up for it by listening as much as I can.. <br /> <br />While I like the older material of Opeth as in My Arms or the Morningrise, the albums like Still Life and particularly Blackwater Park, Damnation and Deliverance really make a difference. I spent a lot of time thinking whether I liked Blackwater or Deliverance more, and it is really hard to make a choice. I have pre-ordered Ghost Reveries and still waiting, so I do not know what shall happen next in my Opeth favorites list. <br /> <br />Notwithstanding my indecisiveness for the best Opeth album, I believe Deliverance is the most progressive, developed and most accomplished album of Opeth in terms of song structure, production and sound. Especially the drums are much more creative and independent in this album when compared to Blackwater or any other Opeth album.  <br /> <br />I think this album includes the best of Lopez, not only performance wise, but also sound wise. In Blackwater Park, he was more like flowing with the band, not much of an extra contribution, except for occasional crazy double bass patterns, keeping the fills at a minimum and leaving almost everything creative to guitars and vocals. But in Deliverance, he leads the band and gets a huge part in the being creative department. The drums in Deliverance have really a story to tell. In the final part of the song \\"Deliverance\\", we witness an incredible rhythmic progression by Lopez. The added splashes and chinas onto the already repeated rhythm, added a lot of spice for those who can appreciate. Lopez is definitely one of the best drummers around. Add a bit of more power to his playing and a couple of signature fills and rhythms and he would be a trademark. His contribution is immense. <br /> <br />As for the songs, Wreath is like a big fist in your face and keeps hammering you for the remaining 10+ minutes even toughit also contains some really beautiful mellow parts, one of the best Opeth songs ever. However the second song, Deliverance is, in my point of view, the best Opeth song ever. You should listen to it so that I do not have to struggle to define it. Especially the final part of the song...I call it a masterpiece...A Fair Judgment is also one of my favorites. Great vocals and great vocal melodies...Master's Apprentice starts with a cool riff and builds its way from there-definitely one of the favorites of the album. By the Pain I See in Others is the one song that I couldn't get very much into... <br /> <br />I don't see a lot of bands around today, which possess all the key ingredients to make a perfect rock band; a loyal fan base, high instrument skills, original, creative and honest song writing, and a non-compromising philosophy. I think Opeth has them all...And I'd recommend them to everyone looking for a good rock band to listen to...  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004YW6I|5.0|Despite having a happy theme, this album still possesses an underlying sense of gloom and doom. Even among her more lovestruck songs like \\"This Mess We're In\\" and \\"This is Love,\\" Harvey sings with cynicism and control rather than with abandon and carefreeness. There are certain songs where love even takes the backseat--i.e. \\"Big Exit,\\" \\"Kamikaze,\\" \\"Horses in my Dreams\\"--focusing instead on self-actualization and disillusionment. In fact, as the title implies, these songs are stories of isolation and alienation within metropolitans and seashores that all seem the same. The final song \\"We Float\\" sums the entire themes of the album--\\"take life as it comes.\\"
B000002KKX|5.0|I'm listening to this album right now and have to, once again, give it up to Christopher Cross, Michael Omartian, and all of the other performers on this superior effort.  Somewhat controversial when released, this album has aged quite well.  I only \\"liked\\" this sound when it first came out and my appreciation of Cross's songwriting skills has deepened with time (and age).  I confess to having utterly overlooked the Beatlesque sophistication and simply marvelous songwriting of \\"Poor Shirley\\" at first.  I also have found new appreciation for the pop n'roll bliss of \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\" as well.  And of course listening to \\"Sailing\\" just simply reduces me to emotionally cleansing and relaxing tears of sonic bliss.  Simply marvelous.  Christopher Cross helped define the \\"adult contemporary\\" genre with this record.  He also set the bar very high.
0684135051|3.0|I'm a beginning knitter, but an experienced sewer/crafter, so the other reviews that said this book wasn't for beginners didn't scare me away.  In fact, I was encouraged to purchase the book when others said Elizabeth Zimmermann gave percentage stitches and non-specific instructions. I thrive on teachers who encourage students to make adjustments and alter patterns to fit. I had a poncho pattern that I thought would be easier to work in the round, rather than back and forth in two pieces, and I ordered this book, just so I might figure out how to do my poncho in the round.  There really isn't enough specific info in this book to help me, and the generic rant on the necessity of gauge and how to make stitches, I've already learned or read better in other books. Everyone says she refers back to this first book in her subsequent books, so I'm sure I won't be sorry I have this book in my library,  but it wasn't the right book for me right now.  I was impressed enough with the author's approach however, that I will probably order her Sweater Workshop and video when I get ready to knit a sweater in the round.
0375507256|5.0|It has been a while since I was driven to pick up a book, despite fatigue, despite more 'urgent' priorities.  This has been an absolute pleasure to read, and carries my highest recommendation.... it is sufficiently complex that it engages the intellect with narrative and structural magics, but it's characters and environs are always accessible.  I found, as have other reviewers, numerous homages to other written work and also film. Unmentioned elsewhere is the delightful echo of \\"Ridley Walker\\", by Russell Hoban, in the segment that straddles the 'Middle' of the narrative - set in a post-epochalypse (pun!) tribal landscape of the Hawiian islands.  This segment was the most evocative to me, and plays well to my sad understanding, reinforced by the 2004 Massey Lectures (Wright; \\"A Short History Of Progress\\") that we are just too hard-wired in our behaviour to escape from our own egocentric impulses.  Who will write *our* history in the future? This book, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" would be a great help to them.
0671027344|3.0|Note:  Mild spoilers below. <br /> <br />First and foremost, I would probably give this 3.5 stars if that were possible.   <br /> <br />As for the book...I thought it was pretty well done.  However, because this type of \\"coming of age\\" story is so relatable, I think reviews for it tend to be higher than they should be. <br /> <br />Charlie is a likeable protagonist and there are times when the story clicks very well, but on the whole I think Chbosky's tale lacks the realism that is so important in a novel like this one.  For instance, people like Sam and Patrick aren't the type to attend school dances.  Another example is the sequence where Charlie visits Bill's house.  It didn't feel right for Bill to praise Charlie as one of the smartest people he's ever met.  Charlie never struck me as being particularly bright;  quite perceptive and observant, perhaps, but not particularly smart.
0787117668|5.0|More than a decade ago, I checked out maybe two to three audiobook titles every week from my local library, daring myself to make it through the large metro library's full colllection. I made it through 300 or 400 great and no-so-great works. This title? Easily my favorite among all those audiobooks. I knew \\"Dunces\\" was high on many people's lists of favorite books. But folks, you'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining listen than hearing Arte Johnson -- sketch comic from the Laugh-In series of the 70s -- personify so many loony characters with such devastating accuracy and admirable restraint. I remember having to pull my car over several times to regain composure from laughing. That never happened since. Get the Arte Johnson abridged audiocassette version -- SO worth the trouble.

0194313425|4.0|Took a long to get here, since it was coming from Alaska, and I gave the wrong address initially, but it arrived. Was frustrated because I paid for expedited shipping but it was definitely not in a hurry to arrive. But it arrived eventually, in quite good condition - no markings or highlighting, cover straight and unbent, only one random sticker on the cover. Don't pay for faster shipping, a waste of money, but otherwise just fine. Would use this vendor again.
0679416781|1.0|I made it halfway through this book before giving up on it.  As an avid reader, I seldom put a book down.  I just couldn't find anything to compel me to finish this one.  At the mid-point, I still felt that the characters were being introduced - endlessly.  In a character study, I expect to know something about what is going on in the heads of the characters, but aside from brief flashbacks inserted randomly into the text, you are told nothing about what is in the characters minds.  Occasionally, they are said to look mournful, or pensive, etc, but however picturesque the descriptions are, they are no substitute for mental activity or plot.  If the author's intention was to paint an outside portrait of the survivors of a war, that was accomplished.  There is a strange other-worldly disconnected feel to the characters.  You can feel their isolation from world; but it makes for a one-note read.  There is a patina of unreality to their world that reads almost like a fairy tale - but one where nothing happens.  The characters seem to be stuck in an amber of PTSD.  Most of the book to the halfway point was just very nicely written descriptions of their day to day life.  How they bathed, what they ate, which room they slept in, etc.  Basically, this book was like watching a silent drama.  You could see what they were doing, and what they were remembering, but there was no significant action going on, and no way to get in their heads.  It was kind of like trying to do psychoanalysis on a picture.
B000AADYYO|5.0|there is probably nothing i could have added to all these reviews. my only suggestion is: buy this cd. this is a real thing. it is going to stimulate both your heart and your mind. does anything else matter?
0307120007|5.0|My daughter loved this book.  It was literally hours of fun when she was an infant (parent and baby together and baby by herself).  I like to give this book as an extra shower gift and have yet to be disappointed at the response by a new baby.  The senses are involved which makes the reading experience fun -- feel, smell. Different textures are introduced -- Daddy's scratchy face, the soft bunny.  The book closes with Paul and Judy waving goodbye and the book asking the baby if she can wave bye bye.  I can't tell you how CUTE it is when your baby starts enthusiastically screaming bye bye to the characters in her favorite book.
B00000DLVA|3.0|Compared to \\"Long Gone Before Daylight\\", which was the first album I heard, I was surprised to listen to \\"Gran Turismo\\"; with it`s minimal production, almost new-wave sound.. At first I also found the songs far behind the great songwriting on \\"Daylight\\". But several songs grow on you when you get to know them better.<br /><br />\\"Paralyzed\\" the opening tracks is a slow song with distorted guitars and good chorus.<br /><br />Next track is the Blondie-inspired single \\"Erase and Rewind\\", a good pop-tune, but not very memorable.<br /><br />\\"Explode\\" and \\"Starter\\" are songs in the same vein as \\"Paralysed\\"; both songs go on too long for my taste.<br /><br />\\"Higher\\" is a beautiful ballad, one of my favourires on the album.<br /><br />\\"Marvel Hill\\" I simply just don`t like.<br /><br />Next highlight is the great single \\"My Favorite Game\\" ; another \\"Blondie-type\\" song.<br /><br />\\"Junk Of The Hearts\\" is also a great track.<br /><br />Conclusion: An album not nearly as strong as \\"Long Gone Before Daylight\\", but songs like \\"Erase and Rewind\\", \\"Higher\\", \\"My Favorite Game\\", \\"Junk of the Hearts\\" and a few other good tracks, make this decent album.
B000002L99|5.0|\\"5150\\"(1986). Van Halen's seventh album,and their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals. <br /> <br />By the mid 1980's,Van Halen had left the 70's being one of the most influential and succesful rock bands around. The only problem was that VH lead singer David Lee Roth had become egotistical and hard to work with and decided to quit the band--meaning that Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen,and Michael Anthony were going to have to recruit a new lead singer for VH. As we all know,the singer they chose was Sammy Hagar,and the question you are already asking yourself is if Van Halen were still a good band when Sammy Hagar was their lead singer. Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />To answer my first question,Van Halen were still a good band when Sammy Hagar was their lead vocalist(I like DLR better than Hagar--although I do like Hagar)and this album gave a nice rebirth to Van Halen. Outdated as it is,it still is a really good album. It(this album)sounds like leftovers from Montrose,Sammy Hagar's solo material,and Van Halen's last album with David Lee Roth(1984)and it sounds really good. The album opens with GOOD ENOUGH,a fun and catchy rocker,and has several good moments. The ballads--WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE,DREAMS,and LOVE WALKS IN are all very nice and pretty and feauture some of Eddie Van Halen's best guitar solos,SUMMER NIGHTS is a fun party song,and the album ends with a very funny tracK(I know other Amazon reviewers hate this,but to me it sounds quite funny)entitled INSIDE--the lyrics,music,singing,and dialogue are all hillarious. And this is pretty much a great album from start to finish--Sammy Hagar tryed to get Van Halen get to new heights in their career,and he did a good job at that. The songwriting here sounds really good,and like I already said,I prefer David Lee Roth over Sammy Hagar,but when Sammy Hagar became the lead singer of Van Halen,VH became a whole new band. Alex Van Halen uses electronic 80's drums on this CD,and they sound really goodon here. Again,this album is outdated,but it still is really good. <br /> <br />Overall,one of the best CDS of the 80's,and a must have CD for any fan of Van Halen(or,Van Hagar).  I would venture to call this a hair metal record,and one of the best CDS of the 80's as well. Hopefully Van Halen and Sammy Hagar will make a new,decent studio album soon.
B00008A7QK|4.0|\\"Electric Warrior\\" was the first T Rex album as a 4-piece band. Originally Bolan called his duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the sound was mostly acoustic. With the 2 1970 singles \\"Ride a White Swan\\" and \\"Hot Love\\" Bolan and producer Tony Visconti had found a fatter sound, which proved be what was needed to give Bolan his big break-through.<br /><br />\\"Electric Warrior\\" was recorded over a period when the band was touring in America and the songs were recorded in various different studios in both England and the States. Nevertheless there is a very consistent sound on this album, which with the follow-up , \\"The Slider\\", turned out to be his artistic and commercial highlights.<br /><br />This is glam rock at its very best. The riff from \\"Get it On\\" has been copied by numerous bands since its release, and the song itself has become a classic.<br /><br />Even though the instrumentation and the song-structures are relatively simple, Tony Visconti's production, using various strings, gives Bolan's songs a full and big sound.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Mambo Sun\\", though probably one of the weaker tracks, features some of the charcteristics of the great album - Bolan unique guitar and the great vocals of Flo and Eddie ( from the Turtles and Frank Zappa )<br /><br />First highlight is \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", which has been given quite a big production - great song.<br /><br />The hit-single \\"Jeepster\\" is simply irressistibly catchy!<br /><br />\\"Monolith\\" is so full of atmosphere!<br /><br />The slow heavy blues \\"Lean Woman Blues\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album; good that it's followed by the great \\"Get in On\\"<br /><br />\\"Planet Queen\\" and \\"Girl\\" are like \\"Monolith a spacey ballads; both soulful and catchy.<br /><br />\\"The Motivator\\" is more or less a \\"Get it On\\" rip off; still a good track.<br /><br />\\"Life's a Gas\\" is a great slow rocker, The closing track \\"Rip Off\\"\\" is the wildest rocker on the album.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are all \\"work in progress\\" takes of \\"Warrior\\" songs. Most of these probably only of interest to Marc Bolan freaks/fanatics; though I must admit I quite like the undubbed version of \\"Mambo Sun\\".<br /><br />Fine informative notes in booklet from producer Tony Visconti!s are all \\"work in progress\\" takes of \\"Warrior\\" songs. Most of these probably only of interest to Marc Bolan freaks/fanatics; though I must admit I quite like the undubbed version of \\"Mambo Sun\\".  <br /> <br />Fine informative notes in booklet from producer Tony Visconti!  <br /> <br />
B000A7S4B0|3.0|This CD contains anit-piracy protection which will prevent you from listening to this CD on iTunes AND therefore on your iPod.  DO NOT buy this CD if you plan on listening to it on an iPod.  Now, as far as the music goes, the magazine reviews are pretty much right on.  It's largely acoustic, mellow, and soulful, and nothing like their previous 2 albums.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|LOVE this album.  Easy listening, great old favorites and a couple of new favorites.  Must have more Michael Buble.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|I've only made it through about 20 minutes so far, but my disappointment in the casting of Al Giordino will sour the rest of the movie.  The actor they cast as 'Al' couldn't be much further from the character in the novels.  He's a swarthy, swashbuckler who has an eye and a way with the ladies.  Steve Zahn does not fit the profile at all...........
B000AAF276|3.0|Eric Clapton has diverse music tastes as you will find on this CD. He does everything from Jazz, Rythm and blues, Soul, and ballads. The problem with the CD is the absence of blues guitar and the classic guitar runs we have all come to love. <br />This CD is very well put together the vocals and harmony are very strong. Eric has put alot of effort into this album. <br />The songs worth listening to are, \\"I'm so tired\\", \\"One track mind, Run home to me and \\"Back home\\". I would recommend this CD to Eric Clapton fans. I am hoping as I listen more and more this CD will grow on me.  <br />I would recommend the \\"dual disc\\" because of the interview and the performances on DVD. <br />
1582403589|5.0|I bought this book basically on the title alone. I was very happy with what I found inside. This is a story of a man that awakens from a coma to find the world overrun with the undead. The story is very reminiscent of Romero's films, very character driven with the zombies as part of the background and not a goofy gorefest. Great plot, great artwork. It's highly addictive (for myself and those I've loaned it to).
B000002MTU|5.0|Eric Clapton has always been a blues guitar player. This CD takes us back to his roots. This is the music that influenced him while he grew up.  There are many great songs on this Album. I will simply hit the highlights.  Blues before Sunrise sets the tone as you hear his gravely voice and his electric slide guitar.  You hear his cover of Hoochie Coochie man which is very strong.   Five long years slows the tempo to slow blues which is probably what Eric does best.  Next is Sinners Prayer, this is my personal favorite song on the CD. It not only has great guitar but the piano as well is awesome. The combination of the two make this song one of his finest ever..  There is also another version of \\"It hurts me too\\" This is very similar to the version on his Crossroads Box Set.  Driftin is an acoustic remake of his song from EC was here.  I actually like this version better.  Groaning the Blues closes the CD on a very strong note.  I have been reading reviews that claim that because Clapton is white, he hasnt paid his dues.  They claim that this is artificial blues and not the real thing.  May I ask why Clapton has appeared with BB King, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Freddie King and Muddy Waters while they were alive and this is simply the tip of the iceberg.  The great black blues singers past and present have accepted him for what he is, an outstanding blues guitar player. They know the real thing when they see it.

B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton over the years has been known for his electric guitar and his fast blues licks.   Eric Clapton grew up listening to Mississippi Delta blues players. I believe this CD allowed Eric to do the songs of his youth. It allowed him to let his hair down and play the music he grew up on.  Eric in this CD puts down his flat pick and changes to finger picking and a slide.  All of the songs an the CD are worth listening to. The highlights of the CD are,\\"Tears in Heaven, Nobody knows, when you're down and out\\", Running on Faith and \\"Walking Blues\\"  He pulls some old songs out of the hat such as Alberta, San Francisco Bay Blues.  What you see here is Eric as you would probably see him at home with his acoustic guitar. I never tire of this CD and would recommend it to anyone, not only Clapton fans. One of his finest ever.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Ben has once again out done himself.  This is easily the best album of the year and I can't wait until the live show in denver this October.  This guy is truly unique and amazing...
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab's 2003 release of \\"Transatlanticism\\" was monumental. The CD was unequivocally focused, vocally cool, lyrically beatiful, and musically sound. How the album manages to average anything less than 5 stars is beyond me. The wonder of Death Cab is nothing new. They have always been a good band. \\"The Photo Album\\" to \\"Transatlanticism\\" was a bridge between a good and an amazing album, respectively. \\"Plans\\" does not reivent the band's talent, though it, at the very least, reaffirms it. Compared to Transalanticism, Plans is less unified. It does not convey a singe, unified message. Another difference is the sound. Plans focuses on a deep, reverberant sound explored similarly by artists like Frou Frou/Imogen Heap. As it is for such musical style, you will need a good audio system to fully appreciate the depth (as stated in another review). Lyrically, Ben is just as competent as he has always been. If you liked any of Death Cab for Cutie's first 5 albums, you will like this one more. If you liked their 6th album (transatlanticism), then you will have already bought \\"Plans\\" since you realized what a masterpiece the band had created in their prior album.   sidenote: Some have been concerned about a dumbed-down mainstream album succeeding the band's major label signing. The label has in no way noticeably changed the Death Cab style. On the contrary, the seamless production of the album adds a depth that the pre-transatlanticism albums didn't have.  Indie rockers and OC groupies enjoy!
B000069HK2|5.0|Yes, McCracken and Co. scream into the microphone when they sing SOME of their songs, but for some odd reason it sounds perfect.  Every scream fits the mood or the melody the songs bring.  There are a few naysayers who dog this album but I don't see how that's possible.  I guess it all comes down to taste and if you don't have any, don't buy this album.  Every track is a highlight on this one as well as their newest, In Love and Death.  On this album, \\"Poetic Tragedy\\" is by far the standout song.  When McCracken screams \\"He feels like, I feel...\\" it's with conviction.  This man pours his heart, soul and lungs out into every one of their songs.  So if you want a hard rock album with a unique sound and an emotional core, buy this album.  However, as I said previously, if you lack taste, go buy a Killers album, these guys are not for you.
B00009RAJI|5.0|This is, I believe, the best Fleetwood Mac album ever record by the band. It begins with a nice quick paced tune, \\"Second Hand News\\" and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there.<br /><br />The album itself does not have a bad tune on it. In fact, of all the 'regular' albums from Fleetwood Mac (excluding Greatest Hits compilations), this album has more hits on it than any other. Hits like 'Dreams,' 'Never Going Back,' 'Don't Stop,' 'Go Your Own Way,' 'The Chain' and 'You Make Loving Fun.\\" All of these get enormous radio play. Moreover, 'Dreams' was a number one hit, and the Album itself held the number one slot for months on end, and has sold over 18 million copies in the U.S. and over 30 million worldwide, putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time.<br /><br />In fact, an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the CD describe how the album had such an impact on America's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell 'Rumor' there would inevitably be two 'U's' in the spelling. Now that is a very strong impact on culture.<br /><br />Every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album. One of my all time favorite songs from Fleetwood Mac is on this album, \\"Never Going Back\\" which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of Rock's premier guitarists, Lindsey Buckingham, and, in my opinion, the best Christine McVie song ever written, \\"Songbird.\\"<br /><br />Now, with this release, you can also get, on a second CD, the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album. This makes for great listening, to hear how the songs developed and were recorded. Moreover, early demos are included along with two 'Jam Sessions.\\" Now, more than ever, this is a must have CD for any lover of Rock music (or music in general for that matter).<br /><br />If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, then chances are you own this album, but if you are just getting introduced to the band, then you must buy this CD. I highly recommend it!must buy this CD. I highly recommend it!

B0009S4IHY|5.0|I am a devoted and long time fan of Hong Kong action movies and pleased to report that Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle is the best of the hundreds I have seen since the early 1970's. Chow's film is at once a loving tribute to and canny summary of the past 35 years of Chinese martial art cinema. KFH is also hysterically funny and the one kung fu DVD I'd gladly show to someone who was not a fan of the genre. The film is beautifully shot and cleverly scripted. It contains old school fight choreography along with marvelous wire-work stunts and up-to-the-minute CGI effects. The cast, mostly unknowns or lesser players in Chinese cinema, is a pure joy and includes several bona fide kung fu masters in key roles. There is really nothing in Chow's previous films that would hint he is capable of creating such a wonderful entertainment. If you didn't see this one in the theaters, stop reading and buy this DVD now. <br /> <br />Note 1: Despite the R rating, I'd be willing to show this gem to pre-teens. With the exception of the first few minutes, the violence is either wildly cartoonish or standard action film fare. <br /> <br />Note 2: As with almost all foreign language films, I recommend watching it in its original language with English subtitles even if an English language track is available. Dubbing is just too damned distracting and can ruin a good movie like this one. <br />
0805047905|5.0|This is a classic! My daughter and I can't stop using the stories concept with everything we see during our daily routines. It's very catchy! We loved it so much that we purchased \\"Polar Bear Polar Bear What do you Hear.\\" We love that too.
0345440900|3.0|Ms. Hogg, with charming British humor, reveals her methods for maintaining a peaceful environment at home for both baby and caregiver in Secrets of the Baby Whisperer.  She begins by categorizing a baby's personality into different types.  Each type, she says, should be treated differently.  She also introduces the SLOW concept to help interpret a baby's cries, and the EASY program to help get a baby on a schedule.  At the heart of her message is that a baby should be treated with respect.<br /><br />Some readers will find her information helpful.  Others may become frustrated in trying to follow her methods.  Not all babies may fit into one of Ms. Hogg's distinctive personality-type descriptions.  nor may every baby's cry fit into a recognizable cry as described in the book.  Potentially, the greatest source of frustration could be in attempting to get a baby to comply to the EASY program.<br /><br />My advise, as a mother, is to do what instinctively feels right.  I don't believe that her methods will work for everyone, but her message to treat a baby with respect certainly applies to all.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Great program.  Such variety and talent.  A joy to watch over and over or to just play as music while working.
0143034901|3.0|Many have equated The Shadow of the Wind to Umberto Eco and Victor Hugo.  I believe a more apt comparison is to Charles Dickens.  This novel is rich in gothic detail.  The mood is as expertly crafted as Bram Stoker's opening chapters of Dracula.  The language is often witty and beautiful.  There are many literary references.  The character Fermin is in many ways the highlight of the novel with his many outrageous and hilarious statements.  Aspects of this character often reminded me of Ignatius J. Reilly from John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces.<br /><br />This book is at its core a love story, and that is where my problems with it lie.  There is no major indication from the jacket, cover, or quotes that this will be a love story.  Some have criticized the age of the characters and the level of their emotions.  I have to agree with those criticisms.  The devastation and power of emotion we experience as teenagers in \\"love\\" is recognized as trivial as we mature.  Carlos Ruiz Zafon seems not to have reached this same understanding.  Also, despite much beautifully crafted imagery, the author occasionally repeats phrases on the same page.  Perhaps this is due to the translation, but I found this repetition amaturish and annoying.  One final criticism, the Mont Blanc pen in the novel is referred to as Meinsterstuck multiple times.  This should have been Meisterstuck (the German word for masterpiece).
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The album opens with 'Neighborhood 1' - A mid tempo track that excellerates into dynamic musical energy and singing, with moving thought-provoking lyrics, its a 5 minute or so song that goes by so quickly from enjoyment, you'd think it was 3 minutes, the whole album works this way - the frontman, 'Win', has one of the most original and sensitive voices ive heard in music for quite a while, its inhuman not to be moved by his singing.    Throughout the entire album various  instruments are used - These people knew what they were doing with their instruments too - Which also makes it hard to believe this is a debut album, as it also reaches a higher calibur of song writing and originality than almost any album released since 2000    The best track, 'Wake Up' is a song that you'll listen to a few times, and never understand how you didn't come up with it first - Its brilliance comes in its simplicity -  the melody seems like a melody we've always had in our heads, but has never been expressed to such an accurate extent, if you're anything like me, you'll have this song on repeat for an hour or so at a time.    Track 5 is another favorite - One of the softer songs off the album and most sad, it is very reminiscent of Jeff Buckleys 'Grace' as the amazon editorial stated, however I could very well like this song more than any song off Grace.    I heard much hype about this album, as most of you have heard by now - Like I was, you are probably in serious doubt as to just how excellent this album is, believe me, as much hype as youve heard about this album, its even better than all that - Ive owned this album for 3 days and have listened to it in its entirity about a dozen times, I plan on listening to it about 3 more times before the day is through.    As a huge Cure fan, I thought the Cure's self-titled 13th album was the best record of 2004 - Sorry to Robert Smith, but now that'll have to take 2nd place behind this album, and after only 3 days.    The fact this isn't currently one of the biggest albums in the world, shows just how polluted mainstream music is.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Hands down, this Judas Priest album has the same energy and strength of their \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" and \\"Painkiller\\" albums. What can I say, they truly are the \\"METAL GODS\\". With the return of Rob Halford, the Priest boys are back to claim their top spot in the metal world, then again, they always were the best. This album is also a relief for the fans because basically, the two studio albums and two live albums with Tim Owens were good but really not in the interest of true Judas Priest fans. Don't get me wrong, I love Tim Owen's and he truly did serve the \\"Metal Gods\\" well but this album I dare say, is by far the best one they ever did since \\"Painkiller\\". Tim Owens did well but the Priest fans wanted Rob back and they got their wish. It was cool of them to bring back the Angel from their \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" album. The album opens up with the same energy as the \\"Painkiller\\" album started. The song \\"Judas Rising\\" is just a test to see if your ready to bang your head again. After that, it's 1984 all over again. I salute the \\"Metal Gods\\" and may there music live forever.

0385486804|5.0|What drives some human beings to take extraordinary risks, push the envelope, explore the frontier? When they succeed, we celebrate them as heroes, pathfinders, pioneers. But when they fail, we mock them as reckless, naïve or maybe insane.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer has crafted a highly detailed and readable account of one such lone adventurer, Chris McCandless, who from an early age marched to a different drummer. McCandless's wanderlust and idealism drew him to reject the links to the civilized world of rules, protocols and inherited lore for raw, unfiltered first-person experience. He was attracted to the road, the desert, the trackless waste. At age 24, he hitched and hiked to a remote Alaskan field to test himself against nature. 112 days later, he had starved to death, leaving in his wake a devastated family and countless questions about his motives.<br /><br />Krakauer pieces together McCandless's story from his writings, family interviews as well as testimony from the many truckers, drifters and other marginal types who met McCandless in his last months. They recall his enormous charm, his stubbornness, his hatred of externally imposed rules. Then there's his idealized regard for the world of adventure found in books by Jack London and Thoreau - men who seldom lived the life they lauded in print. Krakauer resists the temptation to paint McCandless as an empty-headed idealist. McCandless, after all, managed to survive nearly four months in a land that would have conquered most of us inside of a week. The real story of Chris's character and his death is more complex, and a bit less comforting.<br /><br />Is there a longing wired into the brains of some people to disregard comfort in search of an ultimate life-test? Krakauer has a personal reason for writing the book. He sees in McCandless an echo of his own youthful itch to test himself alone against nearly impossible odds - to achieve something no one else has done. The urge seems to puzzle Krakauer, and McCandless's trek seems the perfect vehicle for the exploring the phenomenon.<br /><br />Interestingly, my teenage son hated the book; he found McCandless's lack of common sense and his rejection of good advice a serious obstacle. But I was fascinated by the book, finding it difficult to put down. McCandless reminded me very much of St. Francis of Assisi, another young man who rejected a life of comfort and privilege for a life of poverty and holy misery and who found his muse in the natural world. Francis too died relatively young, but for a millennium has inspired thousands of others to follow in his footsteps. I also can't help hearing echoes of Christ's temptations in the desert. Can the drive that leads one young man to a lonely death in the Alaskan wild lead another to scale peaks to spiritual heights, or to discover new lands? Is there, should there, be a bit of Chris McCandless in each of us?cCandless's trek seems the perfect vehicle for the exploring the phenomenon. <br /> <br />Interestingly, my teenage son hated the book; he found McCandless's lack of common sense and his rejection of good advice a serious obstacle.

0385338686|4.0|This book was delightful - fast-paced, interesting, laugh out loud funny, and romantic, too. Basically, Samantha Sweeting is a high-powered attorney who is up for promotion to partner at her firm. But, when she makes a careless error, she finds herself an outcast at her firm, with friends, and even with her mother. But, her life begins anew when she is mistaken for a housekeeper in another town, and her once frenetic life as a lawyer is forgotten, as she learns to complete simple domestic chores for her employers. The plot is completely ridiculous - I cannot even fathom a person as smart as Samantha agreeing to scrub toilets and like it, but the story makes for a nice read and contains some really funny scenes (mostly in the kitchen, where most of Samantha's mishaps occur). Lucky for Samantha, her employers also have a beefcake gardener on staff (Nathaniel), and he serves as her romantic interest and caretaker. The story was fun, although the last 3 or 4 chapters were rather offputting, because they were so hectic and ill-conceived. It seemed as though the author didn't have a nice way to end the story and everything was jumbled together hastily. Overall, it was worth reading and I'd recommend it!
B0001GF2DS|3.0|Fairly interesting script, done too slow.  Parts of the movie drag.  Nothing exceptional about it.  Overrated.  The best thing about the whole movie is the musical score.  By far.  It really underlines the action.  I think when people rate this movie as an all time great, what they are reacting to is the music.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood isn't all that good and Eli Wallach isn't ugly.  The bad guy was awfully bad though, so at least he wasn't misnamed.<br /><br />The movie is about the search for buried treasure.  Eli Wallach finds out what cemetery it is buried in, and Clint Eastwood finds out what grave it is located in.<br /><br />There is an unreal quiet throughout a lot of the movie.  You don't get the feeling that you are on earth.  You are out in some windswept dustbowl or desert.<br /><br />This movie is stylized, and that, plus the excellent musical score, are the reasons that it is vastly overrated.  Actually it's not that easy to sit through the whole film at one time, in excess of two and a half hours.  I couldn't do it.<br /><br />When someone calls this one of the greatest films of all time, he's falling for the stylization.  It's like The Emperor's New Clothes.  There's really not enough excitement here to make a really great action movie.<br /><br />Another thing people may be falling for is just how cool Clint Eastwood is.  Remember, guys, it's in the script.  He's not that great a shot in real life.  It's make believe, kids.  He's the Marlboro Man.  So what.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|Normally, I'd discredit a CD and knock off a couple stars for having the anti-piracy software that prevents me from having it on my iPod.  I mean, let's face it, the crowd that listens to BRMC is often going to crossover with the iPod-people. This was a very stupid move on the part of RCA, and they need to cut it the hell out.   <br /> <br />The album's available off iTunes in mp3 form - it's going to be pirated in one way or another...prosecute those responsible, and leave my CD alone. <br /> <br />But that's enough preaching.  This is a fantastic album - that's the reason I'm letting this keep all 5 stars.  I actually prefer this direction to their previous.   <br /> <br />The hooks, the melodies help to lay bare the sincerity of the lyrics and drive them home.  There really isn't a filler track on the entire CD - something \\"Take Them On...\\" had a couple of.  \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\", \\"Devil's Waitin'\\" and \\"Promise\\" are my personal favorites. <br /> <br />Can't recommend this enough.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|As cher has said, why do artists feel that its best to keep touring until they get to a point where people start saying \\"he/she is not as good as they used to be?\\". The best thing to do is to go out on peek form doing the best you can do. I really think cher done that with this farewell. Much energy, glittering costumes, still evidently a great power singing voice and still the trade mark witt.<br /><br />In my opinion if you like cher, then this is what you want to see. Cher does all different layouts for the show, dancers are really good, the crowd are buzzing and the backing band/singers are excellent.<br /><br />The extras are good too, 3 extra songs, a video, behind the scenes building up to the concert during a typical day out on the road. An excellent farewell, well thought through and done at the best possible time. Seeing the concert in the flesh is something i will never forget!
B000001FN3|5.0|In the words of Alan Parsons himself on the liner notes, \\"We never expected the Alan Parsons Project to become the name of an act.  The phrase was designed to describe the identity of the album you are now holding.\\"  Tales of Mystery and Imagination is the first and, in my opinion, still the best work of the Project.  Every song is inspired by a specific work of Edgar Alan Poe.  The first half consists of great rock songs with catchy licks, top-notch musicianship and very high production values.    The second half is dominated by the orchestral piece \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\".  I have no idea why the liner notes don't credit Claude Debussy on this piece.  Much of the orchestral parts in Parsons' Usher, including Prelude are adapted from parts of a 2-act opera of Debussy (also called the Fall of the House of Usher) which was unfinished at the time of his (Debussy's) death.  The manuscript was partially reconstituted separately by two composers in 1976 just before the Project put out this album.  For the Parsons score of Usher, Andrew Powell wrote new sections, as well as added sound effects and electronic instrumentation, which adds to the atmosphere, tension and overall power of the piece.    For those who are interested, Amazon lists, but does not have in stock, a CD with a version of the Debussy opera.  It is coupled with The Mask of the Red Death (listed by Amazon as \\"Fantastic Tale\\") by Andre Caplet which is a piece for harp and orchestra inspired by Poe's tale of the same name and which is an amazing, spooky piece that sends shivers up my spine every time I listen to it.    As with many reviewers I also own the original vinyl copy of Tales from its first release and listed to it steadily over the years until this CD came out.  However, perhaps I am in the minority in that I prefer this latter CD with the extra guitar solos, the Welles narration and overall cleaner sound.  In any event this is one of the best (progressive) rock albums ever released and would likely make it on my \\"Desert Island Disks\\" list.
B00000F1D3|4.0|\\"Believe\\" as everyone knows was a worldwide smash single, here in the uk i very much enjoyed seeing it at the no.1 spot for 7 weeks and found out yesterday on tv it was the 5th best selling song of the 90's in the uk. Believe is a good album, the following track \\"the power\\" takes cher almost in another direction with a feel of eastern music added to a slow thump of a beat which worked very well. <br /> <br />\\"Runaway\\" was probably the main song i would say could have been released which has a very groovy darkness about it with a very modern fast basey beat and suits chers vocals very well. <br /> <br />The following 2 songs \\"all or nothing\\" and \\"strong enough\\" are typical cher songs, just with pop beats instead of power rock music. Unfortunately after the 5th song things start taking a little bit of a dive - \\"dov'e l'amore\\" doesnt sit right on this album and sounds too latino, the Emilio Estefan Junior Remix of the song would have sounded better and that was released in the uk. \\"taking back my heart\\" is ok but not alot to it. <br /> <br />After this i think targeting a younger audience was taken to the extreme \\"taxi taxi\\" and \\"love is the groove\\" are very badly wrote, cher does her best but it only just manages a level for 10 year olds to enjoy. Finally we get a remix and not a re-recording of \\"we all sleep alone\\". A little disapointing that there were only 9 new tracks of which 5 were excellent and the others quite the opposite. I gave it 4 stars as the first few deserved 5 stars, usually if i buy an album with 5 tracks on it i really like then thats enough for me to be pretty happy!
0316172324|5.0|You ask yourself, \\"What could be so interesting about 'The Power of Thinking Without Thinking'?... What does that even mean?\\"  I didn't know how to approach this book, except with anticipating curiousity.  I actually bought this and avoided reading it until I could take in Gladwell's earlier success \\"The Tipping Point\\".  After loving that, I knew it was time to address the secret workings of split-second decision making and human perception.  The book sounds ambiguous, inaccessible, and odd... it is not.  It - like only a handful of books I have read over the years - truly reshapes your focus of the world.  I can't do justice to describe the capability of Gladwell's analysis... but from one average reader to the next, put this book at the top of your wishlist and get to it shortly.  (Then I'd move on to the Tipping Point)
B00005JKES|3.0|This is not the complete first season as I was led to believe.  It does not have the 2 hour pilot.  If it did I would have given 5 stars.
1591840562|4.0|This book was a quick and enjoyable refresher in a lot of what I felt like I knew before... which I say to mean, I didn't take life-altering proverbial knowledge with me when I was done... but it did renew my passion and focus my energies in the proper, productive direction.  It's a quick and straight-forward book, capable of tackling in a weekend.  The author is engaging, entertaining, informative and to the point.  I'd recommend checking it out.
0061015725|4.0|In the novel Prey, written by best selling author Michael Crichton, Crichton manages to create villains who are microscopic. At the same time he manages to keep the story intriguing. The story maintains its thrill throughout all the pages, from when Jack Foreman is suspecting his wife to be having an affair, to the final part when he is escaping a burning building of nanotechnology. Crichton does a great job of building the suspense up then bringing something else out of the bag. This leads one thing on to the next; keeping the story spontaneous. A great example is when Jack sees another man in the car with his wife. When the car crashed, the man is not seen in sight, but a van of Xymos is there. This leads Jack to think about his wife's work, and what she is up to there. Though Prey is a truly juicy story, it also has its flaws. In order to understand the concept in the story, Crichton was to give information on the nano-technology which was causing his wife to have an affair, and his ex-company to go down in ruins. The science in this novel about the technology and the cloning at times left the story dry and boring as if it were an academic class. But at times this story was a great read. A reader could gain much information about technology and the harms of it by reading this story. Though technology helps a great amount in life, it can also be more of a danger. In conclusion, the suspense in the story overrides its flaws causing it to be a great novel. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy science fiction, learning about technology, and those who do not get bored effortlessly.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is a cross section of modern and more tradition music.  From Enya's lifting Orinoco Flows to Isle of Innisfree, this is superbly done.  Often \\"Celtic\\" groups are often a kitchen sink of everything, often material that doesn't below.<br /><br />This is a beautifully done album.  I received it for my birthday and truly enjoy relaxing to these dreaming songs.<br /><br />I just do which they would learn that Clannad is a wonderful groups and they did more than Harry's Game!  I get that on nearly every album they are connected with, so please look for some of their more original songs.
B00008US8R|5.0|I loooooove Fallen. I loooooooooove Amy Lee. I looooooooove EVANESCENCE.This is thee best CD in my monsterous CD collection. This album comvers the basic from love to death. Some good songs are Bring Me To Life,Haunted, Tourniquet, Imaginary, Taking Over Me, Hello, My Last Breath and Whisper. My personal favourite is Tourniquet. The singing is amzing,the rock is there, the emotion is there everything is write there on this piece of circle plastic thing. cant wait for the new stuff(sometime in march)
0399152717|5.0|In my humble opinion, no one weaves an adventure tale better than Clive Cussler. I have been riding the wave of his stories since \\"Raise the Titanic\\" was first published. He extends that long tradition of storytelling in his latest thriller. I also like the idea that Cussler has more recently begun to include other writers on the by-line, in this case Paul Kemprecos. Perhaps Kemprecos' earlier books will reappear in print.  <br /> <br />     Dr. Cussler again returns with his tried and proven formula and even dabbles into the realm of fantasy: something he has done at least once before. Kurt Austin has become a force in his own right and will soon stand shoulder to shoulder with Dirk Pitt. <br />  <br />     I agree. Men AND women will enjoy \\"Polar Shift.\\"
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Wow is all can say.  This CD is just amazing.  The string arrangements on the songs are great, they add a whole new depth to the already great instrumentals.  It took me a little bit to get used the singers voice but it really grows on you.  All in all I would have to recommend this CD to everyone. Enjoy!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is defenitely Christina's best work, she co-wrote some songs and even produced it with Ron Fair. <br /> <br />This cd shows Christina's vocal range much more then her debut or Christmas album. <br /> <br />Christina co-wrote: Can't Hold Us Down, Walk Away, Fighter, Infatuation, Loving Me 4 Me, Underappreciated, Make Over, Cruz, Soar, Get Mine Get Yours, Dirrty, The Voice Within, I'm OK, Keep On Singing My Song. Thats pretty amazing for someone whos only in their early twenties (then). <br /> <br />This album has some dance songs, ballads, and great messages like in \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" and \\"Beautiful.\\" <br /> <br />Christina's vocal range is really shown in \\"Keep On Sinigng My Song,\\" where she gets to let loose and sing a lot as long as she could. <br /> <br />If you buy this album you won't regret it, ignore her clothing this album was amazing.
B000001DWG|5.0|What an incredible band, Mother Love Bone should have taken the musical world by storm with their unique blend of glam, punk and Andy Wood's amazing pechant for writing beautiful, epic rock ballads without the over pretentions or goofiness that was displayed by bands such as a Bon Jovi in the late 80's however in an all to common theme for artists in the 1990's, Wood died of a heroin overdose before the release of Apple the group's debut LP, sadly that was not be the only time that particular fate would strike another band in the form of frontman Brad Nowell who also overdosed on heroin while on the brink of rock superstardom before the release of their debut LP Sublime, which would also go on to be one of my favourite albums ever, but thats another review as once again i'm getting ahead of myself, on with the album. Simply amazing, never have i seen heard such emotion and lyrical prowess in some of the most amazing ballads ever in such classics as, \\"Man of golden words\\" \\"Gentle Groove\\", \\"Stargazer\\" \\"Bone China\\" and of course, my vote for the most underrated song ever \\"Chloe Dancer/Crown Of Thorns\\" a moving 8 minute ballad that summarizes everything Wood felt in his life, from his feeling on drug addiction, to the love of his life Xana, wrapped in some of the most powerful, inspirational songwriting ever heard by my ears, not to mention some rockin' out tunes such as \\"This is Shangri-La\\" and \\"Come Bite The Apple\\" a rare gem from a time when music was hitting its apex in the 1988-1997 period before the great crash in 1998 with the rise of boybands and incredibly lame rock acts that have ruined rock for years to come, but again, i digress, throw down the 15 dollars already because this is nothing like Pearl Jam, two different styles of music and song writing, both god like status in my humble opinion. SUPPORT ALL EARLY 90'S ROCK N' ROLL
B00004Y7SF|4.0|Soon after releasing her debut Christina Aguilera, Christina went back into the studios to record a christmas album, on this album her range is shown better. <br /> <br />After releasing the music video \\"What a Girl Wants,\\" from her debut her music video \\"The Christmas Song,\\" was released as a single and a music video also made in 1999. <br /> <br />Some people have been saying Christina shows off too much on this album, I don't think so.  <br /> <br />Instead of just  Christmas classics like \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\\" \\"Oh Holy Night,\\" and \\"Angels We Have Heard on High,\\" there were also some new songs on just this album included. Christina co-wrote \\"This Year,\\" an upbeat more dance christmas song. <br /> <br />The song \\"These Are The Special Times,\\" was put on this album, a beautiful balad written by Diane Warren who also wrote \\"I Turn To You,\\" and \\"Somebody's Somebodys,\\" on Chirsitna's debut. \\"These Are The Special Times,\\" is also on Celine Dion's christmas album. <br /> <br />I recommend this Christmas album to someone who loves pop.
B000002BHE|5.0|Fell in love with her songs and her voice after buying this album.  Great buy, great songs and great range of voice.
B0002O06N0|3.0|These guys do an ok job of aping the North Mississippi hill country blues with a rock twist. But make no mistake about it, these are rock musicians attempting to create a blues fusion sound. It sounds like they caught R.L. Burnside on Letterman or something back in '01 and said, \\"hey, let's do that!\\" Do yourself a favor and get some R.L., Junior Kimbrough or some Cedell Davis. After you hear the real deal, you'll throw rocks at the boys from Akron. It's a shame R.L. had to wait 30 some years for his due. They should give R.L. a cut of everything they sell, but they don't even give any of those guys their props in any of their liner notes.
B0002S94BG|5.0|We'll probably never know what truly happened to Jeff when they fished his body out of the river but one thing we do know is that his was a very rare talent and truly original with something new to say; something that we'll have to depend on his only album to get some inkling of but what an album!<br /><br />One of the best ever debut albums with so much power and passion in the delivery, \\"Grace\\" has influenced a whole lot of people, music lovers and music makers alike.  Jeff could count one Paul McCartney, Tom Verlaine and even Lou Reed among his fans.<br /><br />In any case, the Legacy Edition is truly a must buy as it has a very well remastered version of \\"Grace\\" plus a second disc of great tracks showing Jeff's versatility as well as a very lovingly made DVD to show us the great man, gone before we could really learn more.<br /><br />His story reminds me of another great musician Jim Croce and I suppose you could add Buddy Holly as well as talents that we can only wonder what if.<br /><br />\\"Grace\\" is one great experience and this Legacy Edition is definitely worth the extra bucks for the DVD and 2nd disc.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This is a movie that centers on 4 characters.  Jude Law meets Portman when she is struck by a car in a London Street.  Law accompanies her to the hospital and an immediate attraction leads to them going out with each other and living together. Portman tells Law that she was a stripper in the States but moved to London after a bad relationship. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Law becomes fascinated with Julia Roberts character, who is a lot older than Portman and a photographer.  When Portman arrives at Robert's studio to meet Law she can easily discern that Law is in love with Roberts.  In a poignent scene, Portman starts crying and Roberts photographs her.  That photograph will later be the centerpiece of Robert's exhibition. <br /> <br />Law goes to an Internet chatroom and meets Clive Owens on-line.  Law pretends to be Robert's character and Owens thinks he has met a real sexually charged woman on line.  The two agree to meet at the aquarium the next day.  When Owens goes to the aquarium Julia Roberts just happens to be there.  Owens is sure that she is the one he chatted with and starts up a conversation with her that eventually lead to the two getting married.   <br /> <br />At Robert's public exhibition of her photos Law approaches her and the two start a secret love affair for about a year.  The movie continues to get stranger as Owens comes home from a business trip to confess to Roberts that he had an infidelity with a prostitute but Roberts is there to tell him she is breaking up with him to be with Law. <br /> <br />The movie continues to get more strange and the rest of the film turns out to involve Owens getting psychological revenge on Law.  This is a movie that once you start you cannot leave until the end, even though some parts are hard to understand (the director seems to have time shifts that are not readily apparent until about 5 minutes into some scenes) and you expect Law and Owen to get violent with each other, which never happens. <br /> <br />Both Roberts and Portman are extremely gorgeous in this movie; Portman makes a very convincing stripper while Roberts gives that 40ish great looking woman appearance.
B000002AGN|5.0|Not THE best jazz album of all time but definitely one of the most influential in no small part due to its influence on the mainstream of listeners and creating a whole new fan base for a genre that was previously inaccessible to anyone but the most sophisticated of music lovers.<br /><br />\\"Take Five\\" for me was the tour the force of the album which made me want to get the cd but the other tracks are also good studies of varying time signatures as they pertain to jazz music.  What Dave Brubeck has achieved here is nothing less than a work of art that transcends genre and needs to be experienced by everyone.  Highly recommended and a must have in any cd collection.<br /><br />Updated 20 May 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately the mini-lp replica sleeve version (mlps) is a real treat for fans and collectors alike.  The mlps design is very good and ranks among the best that I've ever seen and the DSD remastered sound quality is very good although the bass is a little overwhelming in parts but not too much to spoil your overall listening enjoyment.<br /><br />Great mlps design, great sound quality and of course great jazz makes the mlps release of this great album and easy review.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B000A3DFZE|3.0|I am torn here.  In the review I posted for the last Mark Knopfler CD, I defended the lower prominence of lead guitar, based on the fact that this is 20-something years later than \\"Sultans of Swing\\", and an artist grows, as they should.<br /><br />I tried to apply this same standard to this Clapton album, but it just doesn't work for me.  Knopfler might have cut back on the guitar gymnastics, but the tone and subject matter of the songs remain that same Knopfler that made me buy all of those albums.  A happy Clapton is not Clapton.  I'm glad his life is going well, but this also might prove that art comes from suffering.<br /><br />I am not a casual fan.  I have every Clapton release (some on old vinyl), and tracked every vintage of his career. I can throw an old disc on that I have heard a thousand times, and experience it like new every time.  I'm afraid \\"Back Home\\" will soon be relegated to the back of my CD shelf next to the dusty Pilgrim and Reptile discs.  Thanks for the decades of great music Eric, but it looks like the days of buying every new album sight unseen has reached the end.<br /><br />I wanted to like this disc, I really did. 3 stars because this is technically a fine recording.  The two missing stars are for the missing desire for me to listen to this disc after the first couple of tries.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|\\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\\"<br /><br />From the moment these words filled up the screen to ecstatic audiences in May of 1977, a legend was born.  That's a pretty clich&eacute; way of putting it (since, chronologically, this happens to be the fourth chapter in the saga), but there is some serious truth behind the impact that this, the original STAR WARS, left upon many viewers.  It's hard to believe that this movie ever got made, too.  It was George Lucas's brainchild project since childhood, but when shooting this movie, he ran into production problem after problem after problem--many executives predicted that STAR WARS would die at the box office.  And now look at what place it has in the history of moviegoers.  If STAR WARS had not been the megahit that it was, there would be no sequels, no prequels, no fans going around reciting memorable quotes from the movie (\\"May the force be with you!\\"), and, well, all that it is.<br /><br />Looking upon STAR WARS, or should I say, EPISODE IV:  A NEW HOPE, it really is not hard to understand why this film became such a status of pop culture.  Sure, it doesn't have the flashy graphics of today's big, loud and noisy CGI films (although this reincarnation does; more on that later)--but what makes this movie such a classic is simply because, at heart, it is great FUN.  The storyline is epic and action-packed (those starship battles and the climactic Death Star Trench fight are always fresh every time), the atmosphere that Lucas created is imaginative and engaging, and, best of all, it has a cast of characters that have quickly become household names--eager, earnest young hero Luke Skywalker; dashing, courageous Captain Han Solo; tempestuous yet regal Princess Leia; furry Wookie Chewbacca; wise, saintly Obi-Wan Kenobi; ruthless helmeted villain, Darth Vader; and of course, those lovable robots (sorry, droids), C-3PO and R2-D2.<br /><br />It helps, too, that talented performers bring this eccentric cast to life.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine a better trio than Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher as the three human leads, Alec Guiness as the elderly Jedi Master, Anthony Daniels as the golden, worrisome robot, or even James Earl Jones' memorably stentorian voice as Vader (one of cinema's greatest vocal performances ever).  Say what you will about George Lucas' directing abilities, but these guys bring an infectious, lasting appeal to their roles that it makes those in the prequels pretty stiff by comparison.<br /><br />Equally memorable is John Williams' soundtrack, the title fanfare has been used in every STAR WARS movie to date, and of course, the motifs Williams creates for the characters fit them to a T.  One can only imagine the atmosphere of STAR WARS had it been scored by someone else....<br /><br />With all this, and more, it's no wonder that STAR WARS's impact is still going strong, and, at the risk of causing controversy, the original trilogy can easily hold its own against some of the more cinematically complex and impressive trilogies of our time such as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, THE GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE.<br /><br />However, George Lucas wasn't satisfied with his original version of STAR WARS (the miniscule budget he received could hardly be enough to develop some of the story's more ambitious scope), so in 1997, he and his company, LucasFilm Ltd., re-released the film as a \\"Special Edition\\".  This version consists of some added-in and/or altered scenes as well as some more enhanced visual effects.  Purists have opposed these additions, especially since Lucas has not decided to release the original print of STAR WARS on DVD.  While this is a valid argument, Lucas himself has stated that this revamp of A NEW HOPE is HIS vision.  But I don't want to get into the fan controversy about the Special Editions.  On this account, I will say that watching this more beefed-up version is a treat in and of itself; it's interesting (and fun) to pinpoint the differences between the original and the new incarnations.  Admittingly, some of the added-in stuff isn't really necessary (in particular, I COULD probably have done without the altered scene where Greedo shoots first at Han, although I'm not nearly as anal about it as others are), but they hardly affect the flow of the story and just add another level of enjoyment to the experience.<br /><br />For this DVD release of A NEW HOPE (which coincides with the DVD release of the original trilogy), the movie has been tinkered with yet again, this time to fix some of the more glaring flaws that were present in the Special Editions.  Although it's not completely perfect (I did notice some matte-boxing around some of the starships in some shots), this version is about as good as it can get.  Yes, I would like a chance to own the original on DVD as well, but this presentation is still excellent--the hard work that went into the visual and aural restoration is very commendable and is especially spectacular if you have a widescreen TV or state-of-the-art sound system.<br /><br />No matter which version it is presented in, though, STAR WARS is still, well, STAR WARS.nt the differences between the original and the new incarnations.

B0001GF2DS|5.0|This movie was way ahead of its time.  Its classic plot to its colorful characters, this movie is a timeless classic.  Like many other who have posted on this movie, I was young when I saw it and the most striking aspect of the film was its creative soundtrack. Regarding the characters, Eastwood might take the spotlight, but Tuco made the whole movie.  His devilish sense of humor and almost every characteristic makes you fall in love with his character.  This is a classic and everyone should watch it.
B0002XDODU|5.0|At first, I was scared to buy this album. Mutter was so perfect, that it seemed like it could only get worse from there. Not only did Mutter have awesome riffs, it had vocals that show that the singer (Till) has finally figured his voice out. <br /> <br />When I first listed to the CD, I was completely blown away. Reise, Reise was a great track to start the album off with. Mein Teil is a really creepy song, and reading the lyrics makes it even freakier. My personal favorites, though, are Morgenstern and Ohne Dich. Morgenstern has a very nice feel to it. With the choir, it really feels dark, and the guitar adds a lot to it. Ohne Dich really sounds like a nice love song, but still keeps to the Rammstein \\"tradition\\" of keeping it heavy, but not in an obigitory way. <br /> <br />If you are a Rammstein fan, and on the fence about this one, know this: you can't really compare this to any of their other albums. This is very different (with a lot of acoustic riffs and less keyboard). So if change isn't your thing, I would skip this one. But if you like when bands change, then you'll realize that this album is near-perfect.
B0000062GE|5.0|Is it metal, is it electronic? Who cares, it's great.. I've read a review where the editor stated that on DD, Stabbing Westward tried to 'bolster' their electronic influences at the expense of their 'metal links'...<br /><br />While some of these songs definately trend toward industrial, songs like 'When I'm Dead' and 'On Your Way Down' are metal, and 'Save Yourself' and \\"How can I hold on' sound like 'technical' (vs accoustical) versions of a metal song.<br /><br />Yeah there are a couple duds..'Drug store' is pretty poor, and the album starts to bog down with 'Desperate Now' and \\"goodbye', but that is only to lull you to sleep before SW once again explodes with 'When I'm Dead'..<br /><br />Lyrically this album is probably their best, especially in terms of variety.  You get it all.. A song for every mood, with the best being saved for last.<br /><br />'Waking up beside you' is an absolute gem. This is the type of song that groups like the Scorps and Def Leppard wished they were writing when they came out with those God Awful ballads in mid to late 80's.<br /><br />I took music compositon classes in high school and college, and my biggest regret has always been the fact that I could never express myself lyrically the way these guys can...<br /><br />So call it technical metal, or call it industrial, call it a poor man's NIN, but whatever you classify this as, you have to love it.
0671449028|5.0|I've just bought a bunch of Sandra Boynton books for my 13 mo old and he loves them.  He likes the rhythm, the pictures and always chuckles when I pick up the book to read.  The illustrations are great.  I just can't say enough about her books.  They are excellent.
0792833236|5.0|In 'Raging Bull' Scorcese does with ease what most film-makers would find exceedingly difficult, to make us take pity on, and to like, a seemingly unlikeable character.     De Niro's depiction of Jake LaMotta is mind blowing and is surely one that would rank in any top ten. De Niro's method acting reaches it's pinnacle here in a role that he absolutely lived and breathed for over a year. His dedication to the part, coupled to the fact that it was he who brought the story to Scorcese's attention, makes this fine cinematic achievement as much his as it is Scorcese's.    The award winning editing links this film together beautifully, nowhere is this more evident than in the fight scenes. The physical and often emotional battering that Jake takes in these fights are so fantastically and graphically rendered, that you find yourself thinking never has beauty seemed so hideous.    LaMotta's self abusing and self destructing nature turns a story of success and riches into one of despair, lonliness and failure. His quote from 'On the waterfront' in the last scene is fitting but is also indicative of where the stories of the two famous characters separate. LaMotta got the breaks that Terry Molloy didn't but he threw them away. He will not get a second chance and will not get the reprieve in dignity that Molloy did, as LaMotta is a man who has been knocked to the mat and is out for the count.
0399152717|5.0|Will there be any plot-twist that will stun you in the pages of this latest Cussler/Kemprecos tale featuring Kurt Austin?  Nope.  Did I enjoy it just as much anyway?  Yup.  The storyline follows the tried and true Cussler formula that was earlier virtually perfected long ago with the Dirk Pitt novels: begin the story long ago with an amazing event, and somehow manage to tie it together with events of today.  Sure 'nuff, this latest tale does exactly that, and since they followed everything tried and true, I just knew I was in for a fun ride.<br /><br />Now since I am NOT any kind of scientist or mathemetician, the explanations about the possibility of an actual shift in the magnetic poles of the planet certainly seemed plausible to me.  If of course you understand that kind of science, well you may find some kind of glaring error, but I happily did not.  Instead I found the science behind Polar Shift to be pretty convincing.<br /><br />Did a WWII era scientist actually discover a way to shift the Poles using electromagnetic energy (at least I think that is what they used...)?  He certainly seemed genuine to the military minds of Russia and Germany that they wanted him to develop a weapon for themselves.  A daring escape saves Lazlo Kovacs life and before long, he finds himself in America and hopefully all his theorums lost for good, too dangerous to be left in the hands of the governments of ANY country.  Unfortunately a few unsavory people come across these long lost theories and begin to run experiments which cause havoc on weather patterns and possible irreversible catastrophic damage to the earth.  They also mistakenly believe that they can reverse the damage once it begins, but nobody apparently knows this for certain.  The plans and the backstory as to why this corporation embarks on such a horrible plan are also quite interesting to the storyline.  Lets just say if you dislike the so-called *Elites* in the world, you actually may root for the bad guys -- at least for part of the novel.<br /><br />Anyway, the grand daughter of Lazlo Kovacs unknowingly is a pawn in the grand scheme of the featured bad guys in 'Polar Shift'.  Does she know the antidote to the Theorums developed by Kovacs?  If she does, she is completely unaware of them.  Inject an additional side story involving the possible cloning of extinct Wooly Mammoths and you've got a novel worthy of Clive Cussler.  I believe that Clive only comes up with the storylines for these books and that Paul Kemprecos actually writes the stories, and whether or not he actually does, the end results are almost always equal to most of the Dirk Pitt tales of the past 12 years or so...heck, Dirk actually makes an appearance in this book by the way.  In short, if you have enjoyed the previous NUMA novels featuring Kurt Austin, add this one to your collection and you won't be disappointed.- at least for part of the novel. <br /> <br />Anyway, the grand daughter of Lazlo Kovacs unknowingly is a pawn in the grand scheme of the featured bad guys in 'Polar Shift'.

B0000399WI|5.0|i first read the story by my favorite author(stephen king) the book is a little different but i think the movie is amazing
B00025ETIW|3.0|You know, many of you probably aren't old enough to realize this, but music goes in cycles. There will always be your \\"arthouse\\" groups, your \\"boyband\\" groups, and your \\"popular\\" groups. My Chemical Romance falls into the latter category. Here's an analogy, My Chemical Romance is to 2005 music what Def Leppard or Motley Crue were to 1980s music. It's asinine lyrics, a manufactured image , but so catchy you'll find yourself singing along or tapping your feet to many songs. This is the kind of music that is needed sometimes. <br /> <br />Now I'll be the first to admit I'm sick of people trying to look like Roberth Smith and play depressing \\"goth\\" music like Joy Division. There are many bands with singers who can't sing to save their lives, but get by on the look that is popular at the moment (I don't want to mention any names...Good Charlotte). My Chemical Romance is riding a wave of the screamo bands that have gotten big lately, and I will be honest, the lead singer can't sing to save his life. The 6th song, it's a slow ballad type song, and it just does not work. I actually started laughing when I first heard it, it's like hearing Papa Roach or Limp Bizkit try to sing ballads, you just have to laugh. My Chemical Romance is good at one thing: writing catchy songs that make people feel like they're writing the songs just for them. Having some tough times in your life and feel alone? \\"I'm Not OK\\" is for you. Lost someone close to you? Try \\"Helena\\". It's not supposed to be Radiohead, so don't treat it as such. <br /> <br />There's always going to be a market for the teenager type music that connects with 15 year old kids who are going through hell because the girls they like don't like them. I grew up with Blink and No Doubt, I have nothing to brag about. This music connects with people, whether it's stupid or not, that's what music is supposed to do. Just enjoy it and don't take it too seriously.
B000005RFQ|4.0|Well, boys & girls... What a distinctive Sabbath chapter this is! You may call it the begining of the end, but this was the most mistreated Sabb album at that point. The downside was the absolutely miserable production which is quite unacceptable for a band who, more than once, brought us cutting edge sound. Even I regard it as a rush job: I believe that the guitar solos on \\"Trashed\\" are too loud, the drums sound like they were recorded from a different room to the mics, blah, blah ,blah...  Ahem!... ANYWAY... The front cover is considered one of the most horrible, ugliest piece of album (f)artwork (source: KERRANG's top 10 worst album sleeves - \\"Born Again\\" is #2, the golden spot being occupied by the Scorpions' \\"Lovedrive\\"). The story behind this regrettable sleeve is actually quite interesting, personally I never understood people who would listen to an album or look at a work of art and say \\"It's a joke!!!\\". Well the \\"Born Again\\" artwork IS a joke... literally!... Steve Joule, who designed it used to work for Ozzy Osbourne and when the latter fell out with Sharon's father the other latter seeked revenge by stealing as many of the Osbourne staff as he could for Black Sabbath. Since Steve didn't want to lose harmony with the Osbournes, he purposefully came up with the most tasteless, dispicable piece of trash he could think of. He took a photograph from a learning magazine (and believe me, when you've seen the original, the Joule version looks quite nice), stuck on the most horrible colors, horns, eyes and fingernails... Sadly, Mr. Iommi loved it and the rest is history... and the band was history. The most ludicrous consequence of this prank was the midget in the devil-baby suit who would jump off the stonehenge stage set and land on a matress... that was once inadvertently removed... OUCH!  So the cover is also a founder of an infamous line of BABY ROCK COVERS featuring Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and Papa Roach's \\"Lovehatetragedy\\".  This is the very last studio albumwith Bill Ward on drums, sadly. He was unable to join the tour due to ill health and was replaced by Bev Bevan.  Most people complain about Ian Gillan's unusual screaming, but I believe that he was only aiming at a different approach. Frankly, I think that joining Black Sabbath was the worst thing that could have happened to Ian for the aforesaid reasons.  The Black Sabbath remasters are quite fun, however it's a shame they didn't include any bonus tracks since there are countless gems from the \\"Born Again\\" session that were never once released. \\"The Fallen\\" is the first track that springs in mind. This album might have been considerably more successful if it had a more polished production and tracklisting.    Well this review is going on a bit, so I'll end it once I've said that \\"Born Again\\" may not reach the standards of its predecesors, but you should still give it a shot.    Cheers!
B00005JNEI|2.0|We were quite disapointed in this.  We believed from all the hype about how it attacked President Bush that the film would hit much harder than it did.
B000001EGE|3.0|yes inspite of the rave reviews by fans i dont think this album is in the class of goodbye yellow brick road or captain fantastic. <br /> <br />i'm a seasoned classic rock listener but my exposure to elton john is only 5 years old. i first started with goodbye yellow ..., followed by captain fantastic. both are musically fantastic albumns. having revelled in the pleasure of both these, honky chateau was the next album i bought. disappointed! <br /> <br />honky cat and rocket man are the stand out tracks here. mellow, i think ..., salvation, monalisa ... are quite interesting. but beyond that ...  <br /> <br />dont get me wrong. i'm not saying the album is bad. just that it is not elton's best. the album seems to lack the cohesiveness and mood and magic of the aforementioned albums. <br />imo you could get goodbye yellow brick road, capt fantastic and grab the two greatest hits cds (vol1 and vol2). that should give you a great representation of elton john's music.
B0002CHIJW|1.0|There's really nothing to watch there. There's nothing to like. Don't get me wrong - I hate violence in all its manifestations in life although I like it on screen, but here we can't even empathize this woman 'cos the movie is just sooo bad. The acting is terrible, characters do very strange and unexplainable things. You can't feel with a character when you see everything in the film is false and naive. Don't believe the taglines - there's nothing shocking in there. It's just one big waste of time. You'll feel cheated and robbed. If you hate violence in cinema, I guess you are not reading this right now and if you like shocking movies, don't bother with this one, there are plenty of others that are much more shocking and I assume you already know them all by names. Go and watch \\"Irreversible\\" for god's sake.
038533348X|5.0|This book was amazing.  I read Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard before reading this book and this is my favourite of the three.  He's a genius.  You have to read it.
B000062YAZ|1.0|First off let me introduce myself, I am a huge metal fan and am into bands like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest (including the thrashy painkiller) and megadeth etc, and am not going to compare this to the Beatles. I am going to say what all the blind Slayer fans cannot say, this album is so freakin overrated it makes you sick. People often call this album the best thrash album of all time and I could never figure it out. There is no way in heck this compares to great albums like Megadeth's rust in peace, which actually was a highly precise thrash classic. Instead Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shoot out solos that are pretty much a complete jumble of random notes, and simple overly used riffs as fast as possible.      To start the album you get the song Angel of Death which gets going really quickly. Once Tom Araya opens his mouth you swear he has one of the worst voices in rock history just hacking out barely comprehensible or incomprehensible lyrics as fast as possible with no depth or power at all. The lyrics that you do here aren't evil or scary, they make you laugh. As a Jew all I found was (when I read the lyrics because u can barely understand them)it was actually funny with sad lines like \\"slow death, immense decay\\" (no good verses just commas of horrific images) only showed how bad lyrical songwriters these guys are. Piece by Piece is even worse and the album pretty much continues sounding exactly the same (minorly different riffs occasionally every here and there but all the same incomprehensible vocals and song structure). The beginning of Jesus Saves offers promise, but the song quickly turns into more of the same old garbage quickly once araya opens his mouth and the rest of the band goes back to their style they were using on the rest of the album. Postmortem offers a nice little opening riff, but its overused and the song never becomes anything worthwile other than same old extreme punk (more that than metal actually as the entire song structures are punk influenced), and the same goes for raining blood.      In the end this album is full of untalented clowns who cant play their instruments trying to sound scary and it comes off flat. Theres almost no variety in the songs, and Kerry King and Hanneman are so overrated its horrible (they're a chaotic mess), and Tom Araya's bass is average and his voice is MISERABLE! Don't buy this piece of junk which sounds like a couple of 14 yr olds in their garage screaming and playing lame riffs with random sloppy solos everywhere and trying to be scary but sounding pathetic. Seriously, a Harley reving up its engine makes better riffs than the overly-repetitive riffs (with one or two exceptions but even those are overplayed and not very complex or great) than hanneman and king. Want good thrash? buy Megadeth's \\"rust in peace\\" (and compare Dave Mustaine and Freedmans guitar to these \\"professionals\\"). want good oldschool metal? Then pick up any 80s Maiden CD or Judas Priest's \\"Stained Class,\\"Screaming for Vengeance,\\" or \\"Painkiller\\" but skip this unless you love wasting your money on 3rd rate bands who aren't as good as the ones mentioned above. Oh yea, the albums really short too, only around 30 mins, which is sad because you have to pay full price for it so that makes it even worse. And was this one of the most influential albums of all time. Not really, it did spawn a couple of even sadder bands (I know its hard to believe) like Cannibal Corpse and Napalm death and some other bad death metal bands, but it hardly changed metal in the long run.
0684833395|5.0|Its about how one sees humour in destruction, endless moronity and loss of lives. Amazingly dealt with Heller talks about Catch 22 situation in all endless loops. All characters have an element of humour and suddenly you find that they are all in danger of loss of life.  <br />Major Major meets people only when he is not in his office, he asks people to wait when he is in office and to let them in when he is out. Lots of confusion and lots of fun especially with ladies. Use of language and the manner in which humour is introduced in serious situations is commendable.  <br />It shows that World War II was fought in confusion and the meaningless fight was made more meaningless by the leaders who themselves didn't know why they were fighting. In the process many lives were lost. <br />I remember Orr's putting apples in cheeks as another humorous incident. Why the whore was hitting him when he was laughing was funny too. Heller has introduced characters and made them alive. Nobody can make one laugh in the face of death as best as Heller. <br />It ends like a movie when the Hero Yossarian has run away to Rome to save his life and every thing is left to your imagination.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|I had seen this on stage and enjoyed it.  I borrowed a copy from the library to share with 2 young dance enthusiasts age 3 & 7.  Both enjoyed it but the 3year old kept watching it over and over.  I returned it and she kept asking for it.  So I borrowed it again, but she kept hiding it because she loved it so much.  So I bought her her own copy.  She knows all the songs, imitates the dancers and has renamed all the cats after people in her family.  On ocassion she has watched it 5 times in one day.  Seeing it again through her eyes has been amazing!   <br /> <br />It is truly a program for all ages!
0553565915|5.0|Here are three things to be considered in response to the validity of Eadie's book: 1.) Her testimony of a council of men (the fact of which has angered so many) is very simple to explain if you read Matthew 19:27-28 (\\"Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\\") and Luke 22:28-30 (\\"Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.). Those twelve men Eadie saw were Jesus' twelve disciples (with Matthias replacing Judas, the betrayer) partaking in the judgment that Christ ordained them to partake of. The fact that they were all men is irrelevant, and if anyone doubts that God doesn't love every single woman He has created in His Image (since male and female created He them), then how can it be that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is so revered by Christian (and even many non-Christian) religions the world over? What about Ruth? Queen Esther? Deborah the Judge? Miriam, the sister of Aaron? Sarah, the wife of Abraham? The list is endless. 2.) The Warring Angels: but of course there are Warring Angels. Michael is a Warring Angel for it was he that was sent to help fight off the demon prince of Persia who was keeping the angel of the Lord from answering Daniel's prayer (Daniel 10). God has His own Heavenly Army: remember Elisha (II Kings 6:11-18)? When encamped by king of Syria's men Elisha's servant became afraid, but Elisha told him \\"Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.\\" And when Elisha asked God to open the servant's eyes, the servant saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire (God's Heavenly Army) surrounding them. 3.) Yes, God can wipe out or save anyone He chooses, but by allowing His angels and the people on earth to stand against evil it solidifies the good of Christ inside them. Just as well, if we give in to evil and stand against the good of all that Christ stands for then we solidify the evil of Satan inside us. And what else can God, when confronted with someone who spits on the Cross of Christ and all Jesus stands for (which is all that is good) and chooses to willfully rebel against such goodness by committing act after act of evil, what else can He do but put them away? Do we not put away serial killers, murderers, and the like in prison? And is not Hell a prison to house whomever the latest anti-Christ is? If such evil is not put away for good then how can there ever be an eternal Kingdom of Peace? And how can there be a place of perfection if another potential Lucifer can rise up to cause more strife and more misery for us all?mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire (God's Heavenly Army) surrounding them. 3.)

0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha was an overall great read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. If you are looking for an easy and simple read, this is not the book for you. It contains profoundly deep themes. Serious thought and consideration are required to understand its full meaning. You must be patient and thoughtful to uncover Siddhartha's importance. Siddhartha's complex themes make it extraordinary. It speaks to the importance of peace, perfection, selflessness, humility, stillness, listening, and so much more. It does not amaze readers through its flashy action, but instead it influences readers through its outstanding morals. Reading Siddhartha is well worth a person's time and energy. Your perspectives will change for the better after completing it. Every human can learn something from Siddhartha. It leaves room for people to personalize themes for themselves. Siddhatha has a place for any person no matter what his race, religion, or culture, as long he is willing to ponder its meaning.

If you're let down also, CHECK OUT the new Warlocks album!!  Like BRMC departed from their usual sexy rock n roll, the Warlocks have departed from their spacey style.  The Warlocks have a great sixties girl group sound, similar to the Raveonettes.  It might get you through your new music craving that wasn't satisfied with the new BRMC record.

B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is Coldplay's third and best album, which is saying a lot considering the excellence of their first two.  Listening to this album it is easy to see how Coldplay has evolved over the years.  You can tell that Coldplay knew they had to put out the best album of the year and they delivered. <br /> <br />Square One - 10/10 - A great way to kick off the album, with a cool chorus that lets you know that Coldplay is back. <br /> <br />What If - 8/10 - A solid Coldplay song with lyrics that are the \\"antithesis of Lennon's Imagine.\\" <br /> <br />White Shadows - 10/10 - One of the best on the album, this song has a great 80's feel to it.  Also a great buildup to an amazing chorus, this song sounds great live. <br /> <br />Fix You - 10/10 - Perhaps the best song to come out this year, a very moving piece, especially the end with the guitar and 4-part harmony.  \\"The Scientist\\" of X&Y. <br /> <br />Talk - 9/10 - A great take on a Kraftwerk riff, this song fits well with the rest of the album. <br /> <br />X&Y - 6/10 - Probably the weakest song on the record, but the chorus is good. <br /> <br />Speed Of Sound - 10/10 - The excellent first single reminiscent of Clocks but an entirely different song and better in my opinion.  You just can't get the piano riff and chorus out of your head. <br /> <br />A Message - 10/10 - A simple but great song about longing for someone.  Especially like it when Jonny's guitar kicks in at the bridge. <br /> <br />Low - 9/10 - Described as \\"Coldplay's fastest and heaviest song,\\" it took awhile to grow on me but it's well done. <br /> <br />The Hardest Part - 10/10 - An easily overlooked song on the record, but I like the piano and guitar, and the heartbreaking lyrics got to me the first time I heard them. <br /> <br />Swallowed In The Sea - 9/10 - Another gem on this CD, a simple love song with lyrics like \\"I could write a song/A hundred miles long/Well that's where I belong/And you belong with me.\\" <br /> <br />Twisted Logic - 7/10 - Not as strong as the other tracks. <br /> <br />Till Kingdom Come - 10/10 - The hidden track, stands out from the rest because of its folk/country feel, but a great love song that describes how many of us have felt at one time or another. <br /> <br />I'm not the kind of reviewer who throws out 10's like hot cakes, so the fact that this album has several 10's shows how great it is.  I usually get tired of music rather quickly, but I bought this CD on day one and it has still not left my CD player.  Highly recommended, this is by far the best CD to come out this year.

B00008ADPF|2.0|I used to be a big Nickelback fan and loved the three first albums, Curb, The State and Silver Side Up. I bought this, expecting it to take a slightly new direction, just like the three previous albums had done, and they sort of did, but boy was I dissappointed... They really have turned into a band that follows the same formula for all their songs, trying to please as many people as possible. That's ok I guess, but the people who liked the early Nickelback will hate this, because it's so repetitive and mainstream-minded that it's unbearable. Earlier they had a certain edge and something groovy about their music that made them special, but this CD doesn't have any of that. It's hard to explain what makes me dislike this album so much, but I guess it's just... it's too \\"clean\\", over-produced, they're trying too hard.  <br />There are some decent rock songs on there, like the opener \\"Flat on the Floor\\" and \\"Another Hole in the Head\\". But then there's songs like \\"Feelin' Way Too Damn Good\\" that are just plain embarrassing and with lyrics like \\"I wanna make love just one last time in the shower\\" leaves images of Chad Kroeger in your mind that you just didn't want to have!  <br />If you're into music with personality, stay the hell away from this. If not... this CD sure is the right choice!

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I own three copies of this movie.  The first was on VHS and was the Director's Cut.  It was decent, but I later bought the DVD version.  When looking around for more movies by the director, I found this version that was taken from the original German film made for TV.   <br /> <br />  If you're a fan of the original movie, this version is like a breath of fresh air.  It really fills in a lot of blanks, and explains more of the character's actions through-out the film.  What's especially nice about content like this, was that it was originally designed to be in the film.  Unlike other director's cuts where the content gets pieced on and is just akward or an extra scene they threw in to make a quick buck,  Das Boot Uncut feels like every scene belongs here.   <br /> <br />  If you've never seen the films, I'd recommend watching the other version, because it's faster paced and keeps the tension high.  If you find you love the film as much as I do, you'll come to find that this version is a real treat, and a pleasure to watch the whole film over again.

0393312836|4.0|Don't take this fine novel too seriously. Yes, there's a statement here about free will and the price society must pay for its preservation, but I believe the funny parts were not meant to escape as many readers as they do. There were times when I was reading this story of a violent teenager (much younger than he was in the film version) where I laughed till my sides ached. I know devotees will see that as sacrilege, but it's also just plain true and if you miss the laughs in here, you're missing the best part.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is about Alex DeLarge, his teenaged gang of \\"droogs\\" and their sordid misadventures in England a generation or two hence. Alex and his cohorts dress like characters straight out of a comic book, talk to one another in Slavic-flavored \\"nadsat speak\\" an invented, brutal dialect, and imbibe psychotropic-laced milk before proceeding on nightly raids into their dilapidated city. In among the descriptions of turf wars, assaults, robberies, vandalism, rape, and eventually cold-blooded murder, Alex tells us of his keen love of classical music, which he appreciates to...er, \\"auto-erotic\\" heights. Alex is intelligent, driven, shows strong leadership skills, and one gets the sense that in another age or slightly different background he might have made something of promising young Tory spouting \\"Britannia Forever!\\" while wrapping himself in the Union Jack. But not in his rusting era of post-Imperial decomposition.<br /><br />Eventually Alex's crime spree goes too far and he is sent to prison for slaying a woman in her home. In the overcrowded prison, Alex survives and in a manner even thrives, and in the course of serving his time, he is befriended by an earnestly good man, the hard-drinking, true believing chaplain, whom Alex uses to his advantage. It is during this period that Alex learns of a psychological treatment being proposed as a means of solving Britain's horrific crime problems. It involves a sort of brainwashing whereby the recipient can no longer of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature. Alex volunteers to be the first to undergo this course of experimentation, and is rendered harmless but somewhat pathetically neutered in his capacity or act on his own volition. It is the consequences of this treatment and the effects it has on Alex's life that provides the final portion of this brilliantly inventive piece of fiction.<br /><br />This is a novel divided into three sections of seven chapters each, highlighting author Burgess' fondness for numerology. Until recently, most readers in the United States read a version that conformed more to the legendary Stanley Kubrick film that ended with Alex \\"cured\\" and once more set free on society. The novel as originally written and now restored goes one step further and projects several years into Alex's future, wherein he outgrows violence and consciously elects to become a law-abiding citizen, an exercise in free will accomplishing what the harsh chemical treatments during his incarceration could not.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is a worthy book that rewards with humor and thoughtful prose.er of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature.

1400079179|4.0|Good settings, nice fast-paced plot, and it holds a reader's interest well. It is fiction, as I think is too often forgotten, and it is a rather simple, thin (far-fetched) sort of tale when you get right down to it. I liked it, but I found that within days of completing it, I forgot much of what went on. I also failed to see why the whole \\"sacred feminine\\" religion was necessarily any better than Christianity, and in its holy orgies and etc. in some ways seemed undignified. As far as books go, TDVC was never boring and had a couple twists here and there that should surprise most readers. The movie version should also be interesting.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|The first footstep you hear on the intro cues you to a very unique CD.  Unique?  Though some compare this band to Radiohead, I feel though they do have the same sounds they are still very different bands.  Back to the review,<br /><br />1. Intro<br /><br />2. Apocalypse Please 9.0/10<br />Blends from the intro footsteps to piano music.  Piano music that still carries the Muse's rock style.  Though I still prefer their guitar, this is still a stellar song.<br /><br />3. Time is running out 8.7/10.<br />Begins with some really good bass.  The lyrics is almost high school level, with words like asphyxiated, elation, contradiction and others.  That's not a knock though, and it doesn't detract from the song.  The only thing almost bad is the snapping which is slightly annoying.  It's slow, but not bad, though the beginning cooed lyrics are an aquired taste.<br /><br />4.Sing for Absolution 8.5/10.<br />Really creepy beginning, the words are either beautiful or disturbing depending on your taste.  Song ends powerfully though.<br /><br />5. Stockholm Syndrome 9.6/10.<br />A stellar song with a video to match.  The beginning guitar is strong and driving, which carries throughtout the song.  The lyrics aren't as imagintive as say, Time is running out by goes well with the guitar.  The songs drums are really loud but that isn't bad is it?  The only thing is, if you buy the CD expecting every song to be like this, you are gravely mistake, (though I still enjoy every song).<br /><br />6.Falling Away With You 9.4/10<br />A hauntingly beautiful song that begins slow and ends slow but is awesome.  Though never will be a single, and is a prime example of aquired taste.  This song focus on lyrics then heavy guitar so some may not like it, but it is one of my favorite.<br /><br />7.Interlude<br /><br />8.Hysteria 9.6/10<br />This song became popular with my friends for that single driving intro.  A standout song, Hysteria boasts a great chorus and powerful guitar.  It is very misleading as to what the CD is like, so if you believe the CD is all like this, think again.<br /><br />9. Blackout 9.5/10<br />A rather bizarre song to follow something as loud and powerful as Hysteria.  Blackout instead is beautiful and quiet.  But don't let that deter you, the words are powerful and it's one of those songs that grow on you.<br /><br />10. Butterflies and Hurricanes 9.5/10<br />Powerful but Classical.  Begins soft, then gets loud, then goes into a piano interlude and then goes back to being loud and powerful.  A instant classic in my book.<br /><br />11. Small Print 9.3/10<br />A single worthy song that is like Hysteria, which beings loud.  The lyrics are really powerful and it doesn't let up toward the end.  Great song but doesn't sound as strong and powerful as Hysteria<br /><br />12.  Endlessly 8.5/10<br />A beautiful melodramatic song.  Though it has good lyrics, it's not as flowing as say Blackout thus the lower score.<br /><br />13. Thoughts of a Dying Atheist 5/10<br />The worst song on the album, the guitar is good but not great, the lyrics are unoriginal and repetitive.  But that's just my opinion, really depends on your taste.<br /><br />14. Ruled by Secrecy 9.1/10<br />A creepy song to end the wonderful Album though not as beautiful as Blackout.  It still captures the aquired taste title as it's highly anti-Hysteria though not a bad thing, because I like both styles.9.

B0000214F0|5.0|This movie tells it like it was in the Roman era when madmen ruled the countries.  The movie is very graphic but portrays the way life was back then.  There are horrific scenes when Caligula takes enjoyment of taking lives of his enemies as well as 'friends'.  There are scenes that portray his undying love/lust for his sister Drusilla and scenes where you can understand the romans' appetite for sex.  Very graphic but after reading a lot on Caligula and the world he lived in, this movie is quite realistic and is HIGHLY recommeded for those who don't mind graphic scenes of all kinds.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This was THE best movie in 2005, hands down.  Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight, his supporters like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine really shine, and the storyline is true to the original series.  Anyone who likes good movies should watch it, even if you're not a 'comic book nut' or action fan.  It's the only movie I paid twice to see in theaters this year, and that's saying something because I never go to the theater!
B000A3DFZE|2.0|I agree with the guy who said this Simon Climie messes up everything. Just listen to Pilgram. It's not very good. As soon as I saw his name I thought \\"another\\" album ruined. Every once in a while Clapton turns out a good album, From the Cradle, Journeyman, Money and Cigerettes etc. The day he decided the guitar wouldn't be the main focus,,,things went south. He is still a good blues guitarist but if you want to hear great songs, great singing and super guitar riffs and solos, pick up Jimmy Thackery's, Sinner Street, Drive to Survive or Healin Ground. This guy is in Stevie Ray Vaughn's league. The old Clapton (Dominoes,Cream,Mayall) will always be one of my favorites but I just don't want to hear sappy crappy bull and boring guitar.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I know this CD came out in 1993 but I still listen to it like it came out yesterday. Rush seemed to do away with alot of the synth on this Cd, I am glad, that sound gets old after a while and it refreshing to hear some serious guitar riffs from Alex Lifeson. My favorite song is \\"Cold Fire\\", it has such a great driving rythm to it, I like \\"Nobodys Hero\\", ( is this song about AIDS? ), \\"Animate Me\\" is a great opening tune, you kind of get a feeling what your in for when you hear it. I think this is the last good CD they have put out. saw them in 04 in Hartford and they really didnt sound that good to me. maybe because it was an outdoor arena. hope to see them again and maybe the sound will be better. I recommend this CD to anybody not familiar with Rush but are interested, a great CD to start listening to them.
B000005ILF|4.0|Mercury Falling~ Sting is a very slick and well done production that sounds a bit like pop music for the \\"Hugo Boss\\" wearing and gin and tonic drinking crowd since it sounds so controlled and dubonair. I think that he is a vert tallented muisician and vocalist that sometimes plays it a bit to safe and does not experiment as much as he did in his earlier days. It is like he has become as predictable as a product from Colgate Palmolive and he does not want to scare his \\"loyal\\" customer so he plays the same kind of music from album to album with slight changes. The book-let is very nice and the font is easy on the eye and the photographs for the cover and inside the book-let are astounding. Even so it is a well produced (if predictable) album that I give four out of 5 stars.

0792163710|5.0|Shane says to Ryker.  Ryker replies, \\"My days? What about yours, gunfighter\\"? Shane, \\"The difference is I know it\\".<br /><br />This is one of the great westerns available today.  With the Grand Tetons sitting in the background, this movie is a timeless classic tale of helping the down trodden.  Shane is the violent man from out of nowhere who came to the aid of the \\"Sodbusters'..Van Heflin and Jean Arthur.  Everyone knew he was a gunfighter and eventually the cattle men and the farmers clash.  This leads to the final show down with Shane facing Jack Palance to \\"Prove it\\".<br />Brandon De Wilde, Joey, is Van Heflin's son who idolizes him.  Shane even shows him how to shoot.  This puts him at odds with Mary..\\"A gun is just a tool no better than the man who uses it\\".  This theme is played on as Shane and the Ryker brothers square off.  Joey runs into town to watch and even to shout out help to Shane in the final gun battle. The closing scene of him yelling for ...'Shane!'..to..'come back'...as Shane rides wounded out to nowhere, with no one to patch him up..never to return..is one of the immortal movie moments.<br /><br />This a must movie for any western collection.<br /><br />P.S.  If you've never been in the Teton Country..either Idaho or Wyoming side...you really owe it to yourself to visit.  This is one of the worlds most beautiful areas.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Absolutely the best movie of the summer of 2005! In fact, it is one of my favorite all time movies. No matter how many times I see it, I still laugh and enjoy the movie. Great acting by everyone. Jonny Depp is the perfect Willy Wonka! He is funny, a tad excentric, and loveable. Although children would enjoy this movie, much of the humor would definitely be understood by the adults. Such as, \\"Good morning, starshine,\\" and the 2001 music (and TV program) in the television room. You really want to see this movie.
0380729407|5.0|This is a great read with so many metaphors, themes and symbolism that it will take several readings to really grasp them all.<br /><br />The story is about two boys Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway that are friends.  They were born, on Halloween night, one minute before(Will) and one minute after(Jim).  Will..is the kind of boy that is caring and thinks problems through.  Jim..is impulsive and acts before thinking. They seem in many ways to be completely opposite of each other.  Will's Father feels old and that he isn't a very good capable father.  He starts questioning his own abilities and about his existence.<br /><br />One Autumn day a Carnival comes to town...Jim and Will sense its' coming on the wind.  The Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show arrives with its' siren song of youth, beauty and dreams regained.  This siren song is played for each one of the people in Green Town, Illinois.  The boys soon learn that the carnival destroys every life it touches.  Soon they are on the run left up to Mr. Halloway to come to the rescue.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much of the book but the idea of temptation's siren song played to everyone presents an interesting theme.  Even when the carnival is gone...is it really gone...or is it just gone from Jim, Will and Mr. Halloway?  Have they learned how to deal with its' song?  Will it return again in another Autumn?  Is it in reality always with us?  There are always fears, regrets, desires and dreads in life and the way we deal with these and the conseqences that follow are indeed very frightening to think about.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that deserve to be read and seriously thought about.
0684833395|5.0|When looking at the book, it looks like they had to cut down a whole tree to make it, but it's worth every cent. Personally, I am not a big reader, or a fast one, for that matter, so it did take me a while to read, but I most certainly enjoyed this book. Joseph Heller does a great job in putting comedy into such a serious topic as war. The book has so many morals like stay strong and success will come and different stories that will keep you awake all night; unfortunately, this book is hard to follow because of all the stories and you need to make sure that you remember what happens to each character and build off of that. I highly recommend it for more skilled readers. I am leaning more towards the high school age, and if you are an adult, then you will also get major kicks out of this one!
B00007LTIG|4.0|This is the first Grateful Dead album.  In addition it has many bonus tracks.  I forgot how good the early recordings were and with the re-mastering they are even better.  I enjoy listening to this CD and reminiscing  the early days of San Francisco.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon would deserve great credit for even attempting this novel; how much more so for making it work so elegantly.  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time tells the tale that beginning with the dog in a middle class English neighborhood through the eyes and in the voice of a high functioning autistic boy who wants to know what happened.  Such a story might fail on many points, becoming saccharine, the author lapsing in the voice of the narrator, or even taking the story in some unreal direction.  Haddon avoids all these pitfalls delivering instead a poignant and entertaining tale. <br /> <br />Most interesting of all, Haddon does a wonderful job at brining the narrator alive and making the reader understand his unique condition.  On matters of human emotion, the reader recognizes things long before the autistic narrator.  At the same time, avoiding conventions that would portray the protagonist as weak, simple, or stupid, Haddon creates someone we respect for his problem solving ability.  Indeed, the narrator often solves mysteries long before the reader, but in ways that remain both believable and credible.  Haddon further deftly gives us a window into his thought process and makes us feel just how alien our world can be to someone who does not understand emotional nuance.   <br /> <br />With its careful prose and rich story, readers will surely appreciate Mr. Haddon's considerable gifts.  Highly recommended. <br />
B0007Y08IS|2.0|This movie suffers from a one-two punch of ineffective writing and uninteresting puppeteering. It's a parody of action movies, played in a straightforward way. The writing did have potential to be effectively witty, but it fell flat in the medium of marionettes they chose. Choose any other medium; cartoons, stop action puppets, CGI animation or even live action. Any of those would have worked beter than these crude, simplistic marionettes. Let's face it, I'm not going to empathize with these nondescript pieces of plastic. It's just not that clever. Even as marionettes go, these were badly designed and badly operated. I think true professional puppeteers will hang their heads in shame at this movie.<br /><br />This movie was surprisingly tame and unimaginative for an unrated and uncensored movie. Cut out a couple brief scenes and bleep out the obscenities like in South Park and you've got a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />The topics of terrorists, jingoistic conservatives and Hollywood liberals have been dealt with many times over in the South Park series and movie. This is a stale rehash of those topics. They can work in a 22 minute TV show with characters we care about, but not when stretched into a 98 minute movie with puppets we don't care about.<br /><br />The South Park guys employed some worn out topics and a bad medium when they made this movie. This is about the only outright clunker they've produced. But they've got the talent to do better in future projects, and I'm sure they will. At least we can thank them for bringing Masasa to our attention. WOW! ;)
B0009UC7HA|3.0|One can't deny the obvious affection for Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series.  The books have been phenomenal bestsellers, and it's odd that this is only the second to be filmed.  (One tends to forget the disastrous attempt at RAISE THE TITANIC back in the 70s).  Director Breck Eisner plays it safe in this adventurous and entertaining entry.  Matthew McConaughey makes a dashing Pitt, using his buff bod and charmingly boyish looks to make Pitt an accessible hero, far from the womanizer in the novels.  Steve Zahn is remarkably restrained as his sidekick, Al, one wishes Zahn was allowed to be a little more ostentatious in his role, though.  Penelope Cruz is nice to look at, but her doctor character could have been played equally as well by countless other actresses.  William H. Macy is underused in his role as the admiral, the commander in chief at NUMA who dishes out Pitt's assignments.  The sometime labyrinthine plot slows down the action at times and one wishes more focus would have been placed on the fascinating ironclad that mysteriously appears in the Sahara desert.  But SAHARA is reminiscent of early James Bond films and even though it didn't storm the box office, a franchise might be welcome.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I probably would not have bought this CD if a friend hadn't mentioned he was going to be in the audience when Michael Buble performed on The Today Show.  I decided to tune in and watch the show and once Michael started to perform, I became an instant fan.  This CD is great, I thought I might like some of the tracks, but now I can't decide which one I like the best, as they are all great!
B000957O82|5.0|An awesome romantic comedy.  Enough comedy/slap stick for the guys and enough romance for the girls.  Great!!!
0393312836|5.0|This book, in my opinion, is an amazing book. However, most people, even if they are intelligent, aren't able to read it. The story is about a man who gets arrested for murdering someone. He is in a gang and has raped, and beat people all the time. This time he murdered a woman. He goes to prison, and gets taken out early to get experimented on. This treatment makes it physically painful for him to commit violent acts. He is then let out into the world. Life is different for Alex (main character). His parents think he is still bad, so they kick him out of the house. Alex goes through many troubles and lives life the way other people used to when Alex beat them. In the story language is harsh. The author decided it would be easier to just make up words then use horrible English words like: rape, kill, murder... etc. The author uses great diction. I have never seen any other writing like this. To understand the book a lot better, watch the movie. The movie follows the context of the book very well. Overall A Clockwork Orange was a very interesting, and great story!
B000003CMD|4.0|After 1971's \\"Allman Bros at Fillmore East\\" and 1972's \\"Eat a Peach,\\" what else could happen with the Allman Brothers?  Simple.  The tightest studio arrangements of the Allman Bros.  Each song on 1973's \\"Brother and Sisters\\" album are a gem.<br /><br />\\"Wasted Words\\" is an understated classic.  \\"Ramblin' Man\\" earned valued radio play and still does today.  \\"Come and Go Blues\\" has the elegance of well arranged classic AB.  \\"Jelly Jelly\\" is by far the best traditional blues tune on the album, with well-executed lead guitar work.  \\"Southbound\\" comes in a close second with very good rhythm guitar.  \\"Jessica\\" is the outstanding recognizable song from the movie \\"Field of Dreams\\" as Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones travel to Minnesota.  If you like dobro guitar, the last song \\"Pony Boy\\" will get your feet a-tappin'.<br /><br />All 7 songs earn a place on this album, each in its own right.  If you like guitar jams that are organized, \\"Ramblin' Man\\" and \\"Jessica\\" will satisfy your hunger.  Many wished that the Allman Bros remained true to jam band status like the previous \\"AB at Fillmore East\\" and \\"Eat a Peach,\\" but I believe is was just a part of their evolution to become a tighter band, with less improvisation, and with better writing capabilities.  Live, they were unparalleled.  These early efforts became the hallmarks of their career which has more or less survived to this day.<br /><br />Sadly, the AB band has lost too many of their original players to death or attrition, and they are still a good band, just not to their former abilities.  There will never be another Duane Allman who could play lead and slide like he could.  Maybe there will, but it will be a long wait for the same style that he played.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I LOVE this game, but you really need to play it to appreciate it.  The box says it's for ages 5 and UP and I support that whole-heartedly.  I've played with kids as well as a 'parents only' game ;)  <br /> <br />I first saw Blokus set up at a very small \\"hands-on\\" kind of toy store in a vacation area. I don't know that the box itself would have attracted me to it ... I bought one and played it w/ my kids (6 and 8) and other families staying in the same area.  One other family purchased it after playing and another said they probably would ... it's that good!! <br /> <br />The kids (and adults, too) grasp the rules IMMEDIATELY, the complexities and subtleties are revealed as you play.  The more you play the more you learn.  <br />  <br />It's a good game for developing concepts of spacial relationships, and 'building bridges' to change the course of play.  You also learn to play offensively as well as defensively.   <br /> <br />According to the box, it's gotten several toy awards as well as some sort of nod from Mensa ... it's really a GOOD all-around family game and I highly recommend it.
B00003CXA6|4.0|EXCELLENT PRESENTATION OF MANY ASPECTS OF THE BATTLE AT GETTYSBURG.  WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS IF IT HAD NOT PASSED OVER A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE BATTLE, i.e. CULP'S HILL, DEVIL'S DEN.
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is one of the greatest coming of age movies of all time.  It tells the story of a disaffected young man and the relationship he develops with a Nazi concentration camp survivor.  In the process he learns that he can develop a relationship with himself and the world at large as well.   <br /> <br />I didn't find it particularly black, it certainly has a great sense of humor, a bit eccentric at times but not all that dark.   <br /> <br />Harold and Maude is one of the all time great movies, I recommend it highly.
B00005ATZT|5.0|It has been said that frequently the reality overpasses the fiction. And this is precisely, the point of departure for this intriguing film, deeply enrooted in the Noir Film grounds. During his absence the wife of Dr. Kimble is being murdered, he arrives to crime scene and fights daringly with the one arm assassin but there is nothing to do. Desperately he makes all what you must not do, leaving his fingerprints around every corner of the room. The killer disappears and obviously he seems to be the main suspect.<br /><br />The train accident is by far one of the most electrifying sequences in the cinema story, magnificently gotten by the Special Effects Team. This twist of fate allows him to escape to prove his innocence.  But the Lieutenant Gerard admirably played by Tommy Lee Jones (Best Supporting Actor) will not rest until he captures to Kimble no matter how.<br /><br />The impressive human chase is only surpassed by Rambo 1, but the final result is major than the sum of its parts. Fabulous action sequences and to my mind the best performance of Harrison Ford in his career, to date.<br /><br />Well deserved acknowledgement to Andrew Davis, a talented film maker, who by the way, is almost disappeared from the map.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.<br /><br />PD. After you leave the hall, are you able to affirm (without blinking) a similar case can not be happening in any region of the world at this moment?
B00005JNTX|5.0|I have 5 stars here for the movie, which I enjoyed greatly.  The DVD leaves a lot to be desired as there are no special features aside from a small featurette.  I have heard rumors about a super edition later in the year with all extras you could ask for, and I'll wait to get it then.   <br />The movie, however is probably unlike anything you have ever seen.  It is one of the few comic book movies that doesn't alter things in apology for being a comic book movie.  It is completely unrealistic, it doesn't really try to look real.  But it does look very cool.  I had a great time watching the movie.  It is a very adult movie as the violence is very extreme at times.  But, for adults, it is a very good movie.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This album gains enough popularity by being known as the start of Progressive rock. This may or may not be true, but it sure got the progressive rock message to many people very early on. \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is a very hard driven jazz/rock fusion along with Greg Lake's almost insane tone in the lyrics. The instrument passage is very fast and tight; it was played very well. The mood changes to the mellow \\"I Talk to the Wind\\", which is actually the song that got me into Crimson. The flute along with the soft ride cymbal makes the song flow beautifully, with Greg Lake once again diving into the vocals to make them fit perfect to the song. Next is \\"Epitaph\\", which is a very emotional driven songs with very meaningful lyrics. Here is an example, \\"Knowledge is a deadly friend/When no one sets the rules/The fate of all Mankind I see/is in the hands of fools.\\" The next song is \\"Moonchild\\" which is the most beautiful song on the album. It contains the most poetic lyrics on the album. At about 2:20 or near about that, the song goes into an \\"experimental\\" section that lasts for around ten minutes, but if you favor relaxing sounds, it is well worth your time. Lastly, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" brings us to the close of the album. It has a folk flavor between the choruses to mellow the mood until the guitars and orchestration take over. <br />    This is an absolutely flawless album and should be in everyone's music collection, regardless if you like progressive rock or not. Recommended with Yes' \\"Close to the Edge\\".
B000AADYYO|4.0|This Swedish quintet have always done their type of metal perfectly: balancing beauty and brutality. 2002's \\"Deliverance\\" was arguably their heaviest album, whereas its sister album, 2003's \\"Damnation,\\" was completely acoustic. \\"Damnation\\" was very pretty, but it only had one mood; it lacked Opeth's famous rapid tempo changes and breakdowns. In that sense, \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is much more of a traditional Opeth album, because it's full of bone crushing breakdowns (and long songs, too; the songs on this record are, on average, over eight minutes in length.) But that's not saying \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is predictable, because even though you know there are going to be tempo changes and breakdowns in about every song, you just don't know when they're going to happen.<br /><br />There's a drawback to a traditional Opeth album like this: it sounds a little too familiar. Fortunately, however, even though it has many similarities to past Opeth C.D.'s, (i.e. \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\"), \\"Ghost Reveries\\" isn't exactly a rehash of a past album. In addition to having a little bit more (and improved) melody, Opeth hired their first ever keyboardist (Per Wiberg) to play on such songs as \\"The Baying of the Hounds.\\" Plus, track four, \\"Atonement,\\" features Middle Eastern drumming.<br /><br />\\"Ghost of Perdition\\" smoothly switches back and forth from power chords and heavy, guttural bellows and light, eloquent strumming. This isn't a bad song, but it doesn't present anything new for Opeth.<br />\\"The Baying of the Hounds\\" finds vocalist Mikael Akerfeldt laying down death metal growls over a skipping rhythm. The song slows down and a couple of cool piano keys (by Per) make an entrance, but the beat speeds back up, and a guitar solo is also tossed in near the end.<br />\\"Beneath the Mire\\" begins with (what sounds like) an organ playing between the guitarists' crunchy riffs. The organ stops, but the guitarists continue playing over a some buzzing bass riffs. The end of this song sort of blends in with the next song, track four.<br />\\"Atonement\\" is a personal favorite because it's just so darn pretty. Opeth make an innovative use of the Middle Eastern drums (which are played by hand), and Mikael's vocals are dreary. There is some electric guitar playing in this song, but it's about half as aggressive and loud as usual. Finally, the keyboardist again enters the mix near the end.<br />\\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" begins with light guitar playing, but it fades out less than a second after it began. There are some chunky riffs near the end of this song, and (even though the music is pretty heavy) Mikael uses his clean, calm voice to carry the tune well and make it somewhat melodic. Unfortunately, this song doesn't deviate from Opeth's patented soft-hard-soft-hard song structure.<br />\\"Hours of Wealth\\" has more acoustic guitars and proper singing which is almost soulful at times. This song is entirely acoustic, and while it isn't as pretty as \\"Atonement,\\" it does have a nice, relaxed guitar solo.<br />\\"The Grand Conjuration\\" works up a thrashing groove, with more bobbing, punching riffs.<br />\\"Isolation Years\\" is another very peaceful acoustic track. The instruments and the vocals are very graceful and dreamy, making the listener feel like they're on a cloud.<br /><br />Opeth have pretty much always used the same formula: death metal alongside pretty, alternative rock. But Opeth do this formula so well that their music doesn't sound stale or recycled. And Opeth have had great success with this formula, so if it ain't broken, why fix it?<br /><br />In conclusion, these songs could use a few more distinguishing features, but this album definitely sounds great. It's still a worthy, four star album which deserves the attention of all metalheads. If you're an Opeth fanatic, this album is a must, and if you're new to them, this is a good place to start.our.  \\"Atonement\\" is a personal favorite because it's just so darn pretty.

Unfortunately, this song doesn't deviate from Opeth's patented soft-hard-soft-hard song structure.  \\"Hours of Wealth\\" has more acoustic guitars and proper singing which is almost soulful at times. This song is entirely acoustic, and while it isn't as pretty as \\"Atonement,\\" it does have a nice, relaxed guitar solo.  \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" works up a thrashing groove, with more bobbing, punching riffs.  \\"Isolation Years\\" is another very peaceful acoustic track. The instruments and the vocals are very graceful and dreamy, making the listener feel like they're on a cloud.    Opeth have pretty much always used the same formula: death metal alongside pretty, alternative rock. But Opeth do this formula so well that their music doesn't sound stale or recycled. And Opeth have had great success with this formula, so if it ain't broken, why fix it?     In conclusion, these songs could use a few more distinguishing features, but this album definitely sounds great. It's still a worthy, four star album which deserves the attention of all metalheads. If you're an Opeth fanatic, this album is a must, and if you're new to them, this is a good place to start.
0061015725|5.0|Science Fiction is most often a genre characterized by either plotlines taking place in the far future with amazing technology, or present day events with hidden discoveries and advancements. Michael Crichton takes the genre in a unique and genius direction with Prey. He uses extreme detail to present certain realities that come together to create something that could logically exist but those realities are as or more amazing or horrific than science fiction.  <br /> <br />Prey is a tale of corporate greed and ignorance. While the main character, Jack, already proved he had strength against his company's instability, his wife is starting to care more and more about her work and as a result she loses interest in her family. Jack then refuses to give up the faith he holds in his wife but he still must satisfy his curiosity, so he accepts a job that will put him in direct contact with her and her coworkers. Thus is the magic of Crichton's reality making you believe in the main character's conviction and what he will do later on in the story. <br /> <br />Because of its logic and emotion, Prey is a story that will work for almost anyone with any interest in science fiction and could potentially draw in those who are unsure about the genre. If there is any weakness in this book, it is how repetitive the descriptions of the technology start to feel if you already understand the basic premise. Otherwise the detail is helpful in understanding the story. <br /> <br />With its detailed and logical plot, Prey is a very intense read as Crichton does an excellent job of generating curiosity and emotion in the reader that coincides with the main character's struggle. For an example of how great Crichton's writing skill is, Prey is among the best. <br />  <br />
0446607274|4.0|I downloaded this detective procedural in electronic format and read it on my Palm during my commute to work.  Better than the usual, routine story about a murder, this novel focuses on the tensions between the LAPD and the people of Los Angeles in the wake of the Rodney King incident.  It's an entertaining read with substance, as the plot touches on the racial biases and political issues that play an often unacknowledged role in law enforcement in a contemporary urban environment.<br /><br />I've found e-books to be economical, as they are often priced several dollars less than a mass market paperback, and they can be easily moved to an external storage device after I'm done reading them on my handheld.  And since I have to carry my Palm around with me everyday in order to access my calendar and contacts files, an electronic book eliminates the need to carry printed reading material, and thus reduces the weight in my shoulder bag.<br /><br />Michael Connelly's books are particularly appropriate for the handheld medium because they are plot-driven page-turners that don't require me to check footnotes or an index.  I'm not sure I'd be equally enthusiastic about using the electronic format for a text book or research report.
0061015725|5.0|Michael Crichton's \\"Prey\\" is an amazing book when ever I picked it up I couldn't seem to put it back down. The book had so much suspense it was a thrilling terrifying tale. It had so many things that you have to figure out it was like one big game. This book had a lot of science and technology which makes it exciting because there were so many ups and downs that the character has to get through and you have to figure it out. This makes you want to keep reading because was such a thrill seeker. The strong points of the book are that it keeps you on the edge of your seat no matter what I know you will want to keep reading. Prey is such an interesting book it has every thing a book needs; family life, adventure, and issues a person would never imagine having to go through. There are really no flaws to this book it's a little slow at first and it has some swear words but once you get passed the first couple pages the book really picks up you will be hooked on reading it I know. The way Michael Crichton writes the book makes it seem so believable and real, so its really hard to put down. I would recommend this book to every one who likes problem solving, drama and, science. This book will keep you interested for hours it was a real page turner.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|With \\"Plans\\" Death Cab has reestablished themselves as a band that _really_ matters. Yes, they've moved to a major label, and all for the better. Their sound is clear and meaningful, and Gibbard's voice shines through stronger than it ever has. Listening to this album brings a feeling of relaxation and contentment that I haven't felt since \\"We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes.\\" Gibbard pulls out lyrics that obviously come from the heart, and restores Death Cab to what they have, and always can be--simply amazing.
0393312836|4.0|This book was very exciting for me to read. I was interested in the book when I started reading it and it also disturbed me of how these people lived and what they did and acted. It didn't turn me off of the book. It actually got me really interested and wanted to read more. I would get out of this book that it is not good to be violent. You won't get very far with it. A strength of this book is the suspense that the author describes. He builds situations up very good. He got me interested in it. A weakness is the diction that Alex and his friends use. The diction is very hard to understand, especially if you don't know Russian, but most of it you can understand by reading what is around the words. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysterious books and suspenseful books. A person who likes to hear about violence would like this book.
B0000029AL|4.0|This is first Aersomith longplay, recorded after 2-3 years of playing in local clubs and small areas at Boston. This is very solid piece of work, and the music here is very unique, shows of what Aerosmith early inspirations were. The only two first longplays were rock n' rolly like this one, then the band turned more into playing hard rockin' stuff.    Let's get more into this one. This shows how great songwriter Steven Tyler was. He wrote almost entire material here, only movin' out is with help of Joe Perry and Somebody is written with a guy called Emspack (who the hell is he, I really don't know) and Walking The Dog is a blues cover. This is one of those albums that I like putting in and just let it go song by song. It's one of my Aerosmith favourite albums, amongst Rocks, Toys In The Attic, and Get Your Wings.     Make It. 9/10. Good opening to the album. Heavy, steady, go! Rockin' all night long with a nice solo to it.    Somebody. 10/10. Propably my favourite here! VERY cool riff, rock n rolling verses (I'm not quite sure about the chorus, but still it's okay) and a good solo (though sounds a bit too much like Led Zeppelin)    Dream On. 10/10. Classic ballad. No doubt about its perfection. Great climate, great riff, great heavy part, all is perfect. Impressive for Tyler (He wrote in in the age of 17)    One Way Street. 10/10. Another Aerosmith Gem. It sounds like dark, oldschool pub blues n' roll. And great harmonicas. And I don't think it's too long. For true Aerosmith fan it'll never get boring.     Mama Kin. 10/10. Classic rocker. I love this riff! One of first Aerosmith minor hits. And a habitue of aproximately all Aerosmith concerts.    Write Me A Letter. 8/10. Rock/Blues N' Roll simple pub song. Nothing special, but still cool.    Movin' Out. 8/10. More darker and mysterious. An early Aerosmith autobiographical song.     Walkin' The Dog. 10/10. Great Blues cover. Surpasses Rufus Thomas' original. One of the finest blues covers Aerosmith did.     I find this album really interesting and it's as well a good point to start for new aero fans, as well as it is a must have for fanatics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't see the series when it was on air originally, but I had heard so much about it that I was curious enough to buy the DVD set.  I wasn't dissappointed.  Firefly is a masterful work, it pretty much has everything in well proportioned amounts;  good and funny dialogue, interesting characters played by good actors, an interesting take on the future with good backstory, good fights of all kinds, palpable sexual tension, interesting juxtapositions of different moral values, with just an all around good balance of storytelling.  I was left wanting more at the end of the series, since its premature cancellation, but also a great sense of satisfaction that is only felt after watching a great movie or reading a great book. I am looking forward to the movies and hoping that they can maintain the same high quality, but the story really lent itself to the weekly series format.
B00001OH7P|4.0|This album takes me right back in a heartbeat to those wild glam daze, and while I don't think it's his best album, I do think it's an important part of any Bowie lovers collection, if only for the title track. I liked all of it, but then I am a fan so I'm biased.  :-)
B0001EFTVA|5.0|When looking at Disney's early releases, it's surprising to see how many \\"classics\\" there is: Bambi, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and many others. Yet in recent years things haven't been so kind to them. Besides the technologically impressive but emotionally hollow Fantasia 2000, Disney hasn't really done a really great film. Home on the Range, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear don't really have the timeless quality that previous releases had. Enter an emerging line of japanese films and the films by Pixar to fill the gap. So we have the third film from the director of Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers. <br /> <br />Gin is a middle-aged ex-cycling champ. Hana is a proud but kind of pathetic drag queen while Miyuki is a runaway teenager. All of them have troubled pasts and issues which they confront once they find an abandoned baby, which they name Kiyoko. They decide to return the baby to its rightful parents only they end up meeting some interesting people such as a mob-type person, a spanish hitman, Hana's old group and some rather mean kids. <br /> <br />There's a certain charm with the film where you start caring about the characters even if it's not big on action sequences which is something that's really missing with today films. Watching the film there is a certain leap of faith you have to take since many of the film moments will \\"yeah right, as if that would happen\\" but the film's meant to be touching and sentimental so you can blame the filmmakers for being really sappy. <br /> <br />Really disappointing are the extras. You get \\"2\\". I put 2 in quotations marks cause there's actually just one. A kind-of informative making-of which has interviews with the director and the 3 leads(I had no idea Miyuki's voice actor was so damn hot) and it has 2 interviews, the first being the best. The interviewer talks too damn much. The 2nd extra is actually just trailers. Whoopee. <br /> <br />With films like Spirited Away, this one and others,maybe there's a new animation group we should be looking at. Only since it's animation from Japan, it probably won't get the recognition it deserves. Too bad.
0446691437|5.0|Unless, of course, THE LITTLE PRINCE, FRANNY AND ZOEY and the autobiography of Charles Mingus count as self help books.  So, of the books that say \\"Self Help\\" on the back, I'd say this is the best.  It's a quick read, which is good because you are going to want to get to work pretty quick after you start this book, and you don't want the rest of the book getting in the way.   <br />Now here's where you are going to want to click the UNHELPFUL button:  I think that the real secret weapon of this book is the cussin'.  Pressfield doesn't write like a sailor or anything like that, but I don't know, the mild profanity made the book go down easier for me.  His swears made me feel like he was writing to an actual person about something he really gives a $%@!* about.  No pie in the sky idealism here.  Good old, crabby, man on the street idealism instead.  Yeah, I really am glad he kept in the swears.
B00000IHC7|4.0|Listening to Rory Gallagher is a bittersweet experience. He was a tremendous guitar player. His passionate playing easily stands beside Eric Clapton and Peter Green as one of the best Anglo-Blues guitarists. It must have been frustrating for him to watch his peers rise to international stardom while he continuously slogged through tour after tour playing in clubs and smaller venues to his loyal core audience. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. His playing and writing were at their peak at this point in his career. God bless Rory Gallagher. He is sadly missed.
B000A88F22|1.0|When this series played on UPN, I was just as fascinated by it as I currently am by the New Orleans Hurricane Katrina footage on CNN.  Both are out-of-control trainwrecks, getting crazier, more horrifying, more f***ed up, and more (dare I say) CHAOTIC by the minute.  Being self-mesmerized (Britney by her narcissism and K-Fed by his greed and venality), both Mr. and Mrs. Federline are perfect retards, and they truly deserve each other.  Just the post-ceremony, reception sequence (in which the males and females wear matching ghetto-track suits) is worth the price of this DVD set.  I know I gave this series a 1-star, but if you can stomach the horrifying and absurd, I HIGHLY recommend watching this.
B0009Y336A|5.0|I was lucky enough to hear the album a number of times before its release in the States.<br /><br />I have been a massive fan of this band since the release of I Should Coco and few have delivered with each release as Supergrass.  Supergrass have slowly inched away from their more aggressive debut and this album shows a band in full maturation without becoming stodgy.  Every track is outstanding and the care in production is obvious.  I doubt this album will give them the attention and respect they deserve, however, for those who take a chance, they will be richly rewarded and immediately want the rest of their catalog.  They've been around since 1994 but have always been overshadowed by their fellow countrymen whether it was Oasis, Blur, Radiohead or Coldplay.  While the jury is still out on Coldplay, not even Radiohead among the others mentioned have been able to consistently release one strong album after another.  This has not been the case with Supergrass.<br /><br />Tales Of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6) kicks the album off with a mellow entrance giving way to a rollicking exit.  It serves as a sample of what is to come.  Its hard for a band to mature while keeping the songwriting true to their roots and this has always been a strength Supergrass had in spades.  The best tracks would probably be St. Petersburg, Roxy and Low C.  They were blamed for being a bit over the top on their second release In It For The Money but most felt it was because they sounded a bit too overproduced.  I disagreed with that but could understand the sentiment.  This is definitely not true with this release.  The soundscape present on this release feels very organic and warm, it almost feels like your listening to it on vinyl.  Anyone who ever had a vinyl collection should catch what I mean by that.  There are horns, strings and rich texture to all of the songs and yet they don't forget to rock out here and there as well.<br /><br />If you love great Pop Rock that simultaneously doesn't take itself too seriously yet reaches for the stars then this album is for you.  After ten years I'm convinced that the only thing that can stop this band would be an apathetic public that ends their ability to release more music.  Regardless of a lack of mass appeal, their music will always triumph and this album might just be a crowning jewel.riously yet reaches for the stars then this album is for you.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album underscores something I've been saying for a LOONG time, ie, Dave Grohl is the Brian Wilson of the 21st Century. This is a GREAT album and I think with time it will only be better. LONG LIVE FOO FIGHTERS!!! On another note, I have run into some of the problems people describe with buying an album and then not being able to play it. My suggestion is to make sure you remove the \\"sbcdhid\\" from your hard drive; rip the cd as an MP3 (using Windows Media) and then save it to hard drive in MP3 format, then you can upload it to whatever you want. I typically buy CDs thru Musicmatch and when I bought an MP3 player (that specifically stated it played WMA flies but neglected to mention \\"PROTECTED\\" WMA files were not included!) I had to go thru this process to transfer files to my MP3 player.
B0006213WG|1.0|this album is terrible!! the songs are all copied from other bands... and they don't sound good at all! only the first album was decent.. don't waste your money on this junk!
B000067CPX|1.0|This album is WEAK beyond words, RHCP have COMPLETELY SOLD OUT. First of all most of the tracks sound like left out tracks from their predecessor Californication and even worse radio friendly in a superficial kind of way. Also Flea and John were having constant feuds whilst recording the album because John didn't want Flea's bass slapping in it and Flea was planning on quiting the band. Also it's like they hired a pop songwriter like Desmond Child to write their songs. John Frusciante has got no energy or feel in his playing which comes across like he's some random session musician. This album is on the same level as Metallica's St Anger and as bad as Van Halen 3, Def Leppard's X and Megadeth's Risk. This album would only appeal to you if your some teeny bopper who listens to Rhianna, Justin Timberlake or a bondi hipster and got a taste for tasteless mainstream radio. However if you are a die hard funk fan then I suggest you grab hold of their 80s albums and BSSM and maybe Californication. Whatever you do DONT BUY IT unless it's in a bargain bin and worth a few dollars.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|Oh my God I can't even think how bad this movie is I mean wow. Okey first off why do we need a new triple X huh? And they got the guy that nobody even thoght of benig the new xXx Ice Cube the man who did good films like Boyz in The Hood and now he go's off and makes this crap my God. And Sam Jackson is'nt that good like he was in the first one here he's a litile sidekick shure he fire's guns in this one but really? And Willem Defoe is the bad guy not the good kind of bad guy like he was in Once Upon A Time In Mexico or Spiderman and he's just a man doing what he toght was right not Evil and his plan to take over the white house and start World War 4 is just a big fat whaste of time well at least it's a smart plan not that smart but still smart. Anyway the only good thing about this movie is that it makes you lagh you're ass off like me the action is dull and boring and the fact that all the good guys are black and the bad guys are white makes you think at how bad this movie really is. And oh yeah Xzibit is in it to pimp some rides so all and all xXx 2 is soo much of a bad movie that you have to buy it if you whant a good lagh
B000002B7U|4.0|this cd is underrated and overrated, especially with it going out of print and not being reissued. so, it was great to get this cd. its no blizzard of ozz or diary of a madman, because randy rhoads can never be replaced or topped, as far as ozzy's solo band guitar players go. but it's a good cd, with a very good guitar player. the best songs are 'shot in the dark' and 'the ultimate sin' ... and 'lightning strikes' isnt a ripoff of crazy train, it just sounds similar in a small few spots, at least to some of the other reviewers. this album is worth buying, especially because it will be extremely hard to find in a few years. ozzy is always good; this is no exception.
0452282152|5.0|This book is a real winner.  The writing is very simple, yet in no way shallow.  This is most appropriate since the story is seen through the eyes of a largely illiterate yet very sensitive young woman.  Vermeer's paintings, reproduced in color, help make the story more relevant and meaningful. <br /> <br />My only gripe is that the story was a bit too hard on the gender roles.  All the men seemed letcherous, although many of the women were not paradigms of virtue.  But this is a persponal gripe and does not detract from the quality or beauty of a great little book.
B00079018K|5.0|So I saw all the whining about not being able to extract mp3s and it took me all of about 30 minutes to search and figure out a way around it.  Now I'm not a genius, but I just like to find a way around things.  If you want to use what i used type in a search 'princeton mediamax' and it tells you how to disable the autorun on your PC (Macs you're on your own!)  Basically what I figured out, or at least I got from it, is Mediamax opens up on your computer and even when I thought I was ripping the mp3s it was ripping a messed up version of them since mediamax was in the background doing it's job.  Soooo I did a little more searching  and found the site I mentioned it says there are two options.  Hold down the shift key while inserting the CD which prevents the CD from autorunning or totally disable the autorun on your PC which is what I did.  Then I popped it in, Made my mp3s and put 'em on my Ipod which I think I'm entitled to since I paid my $9.99 plus 5% tax (It was on sale!)<br /><br />Oh yeah... the CD you ask?  I've only listened to it twice and even though it's not exactly my type of music I really like a few of the songs on it and would give it four stars now and after a lot of listening it would go up to 5 stars anyway and I feel like it deserves the 5 from me for all the bashing it's taking for the copyright thing anyway so there.

0312995423|2.0|I started to read this book and I couldn't stop.  I wasn't expecting much, but the book really got into me thanks to its very intriguing and interesting story.  HOWEVER, there was point in the book when all that was lost.  Once I reached the first half of the book, I was expecting the story to develop in a very interesting end, but instead the author starts to make predictible mistakes.  I don't want to spoil the reading for anyone, so I will not tell exactly wat happens, but the two main characters start to go through very unbelievable and unlogical situations.  In fact, the situations are so unbelieveable that I ended up feeling like and idiot for getting so excited during the first half.     For me, the book has a very dissapointing end, so I just don't recommend it.     By the way, the author also has to get some facts straight since he makes obvious mistakes describing places (Spain) and organizations (NSA).  That also, adds to the lack of quality of this book    In a line, just stay away from it....
0061015725|5.0|I found Prey to be a very intriguing read. Prey provided information about nanotechnology, but in a way that kept you hooked wanting to know more and more. There is amusing dialogue during the entire book, this adds an air of entertainment to Prey. Instead of it just being a boring book about technology, it's entertaining in the way that it presents the information about nanotechnology. Michael Crichton goes into a lot of detail about almost every aspect in Prey. It seems that almost every paragraph in Crichton's book has just a hint of suspense. If you catch that part, you could find yourself sitting and reading Prey for hours on end. For these reasons, and many more, I would recommend Prey to people that enjoy reading about science and/or technology. I might also recommend this book to people who enjoy books filled with suspense, or books that have many true facts dispersed throughout them.
0060763280|5.0|I found the book not to be new in concept, I can find almost every point someplace else.   Having said this, this book is valuable because it is: <br />CONCISE - It takes a minimum of space to present points and punctuate them with compelling examples and analogies. <br />REVEALING- It is extremely helpful in revealing \\"What we know that Ain't so\\" , and providing access to changing that \\"knowledge\\". <br />INSTRUCTIVE - It gives affirmations, exercises and resources to assess and align our knowledge, beliefs, skills and actions.
0375507256|5.0|Easily one of the best books published in the last year, Cloud Atlas is easily the equal of Mitchell's other novels, exploring the limits of human and social freedom across the ages. <br /> <br />He once described the structure of his books as a series of smaller fish being consumed by increasingly larger fish- but in this case we get to see what happens when the whole process goes into reverse- as the 6 separate plots, and with them the history of humankind, goes from early pacific exploration to post-apocalyptic doom and back again. <br /> <br />This kind of narrative trickery would be a tacky gimmick if the book wasn't a masterpiece, but fortunately, that's exactly what Cloud Atlas is...
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The people who consider that Clint Eastwood is better suited to the role of Harmonica have obviously no perception of the brilliance that bronson brings to the role.  The striking blue eyes and that weather beaten face and sense of mystery that makes the character his and his only.  no disrespect to Clint but this is bronson's role. The film is a masterpiece and if you think it is to long you have missed the point of most of leone's work.  All his films have a sense of suspense that he drags out by doing extremely long scenes.  The best example of this is in his film Once Upon A Time in America (before it was shorten to a mear 2 and half hours). The opening scene is the best example in this film in which they wait on the platform for the train.  The detail to the characters physical appearance in this scene is brilliant all of this detail is then prompltly finished by the fact that they get killed. The fact that leone had the patience to do a fifteen minute scene in which most directors would use as the foundation to a film but instead he uses it to introduce a character. Genius! This is the finest example of leone at his best and certainly one of the best westerns ever filmed. If you want a film to spend 3 hours but not notice it has been three hours buy this.

I'm not one to stray from the recipe, so I'm usually hopefull at the outcome, and so far I've not been disappointed.

B00004RF97|5.0|This was and continues to be my favorite ever black-and-white film.  Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, and Catharine Hepburn on the same screen together is an event not to be missed by ANYONE, I don't care if you usually don't like black-and-white flicks.  It's hysterical.  It does have some rather unpleasant undertones as to the proper conduct of women, but if you do your best to overlook that rather outdated view, the film itself - unendingly witty script, sumptuous set, and of course stellar acting - is well worth owning.
192076920X|1.0|I am consistently amazed by the rave reviews for this overlong, tedious and egocentric book. Gregory David Roberts broke out of jail and spent 8 years in India- and it seems he spent most of that time watching Bollywood movies and imagining himself as one of their musclebound superheroes. <br /> <br />Anyone familiar with Hindi cinema staples will recognize all of the usual ingredients here- a tough anti-hero with one foot in the slums and the other in the glitzy underworld of organized crime; the mysterious heroine with a secret life; the over the top action scenes; the bullet riddled character who returns from the grave in the final act; a character who turns out to have an evil twin and the sudden surge of mother love that sets the anti-hero on the road to righteousness. Heck, he even writes  in scenes in which characters spontaneously burst into song.  <br /> <br />The same kind of stuff can be consumed on the screen in an hour or two, without having to wade through a massive missive the size of an average edition of the Bible. <br /> <br />Not only does Roberts expect readers to take this recycled Bolly-waffle as an original story, but he also wants us to swallow it as an autobiography.  <br /> <br />The self egrandising tone is pretty hard to take- there are repeated descriptions of himself as both a \\"hard, muscled tough man\\" and a \\"sensitive intellectual activist\\". In addition to rescuing countless helpless slum dwellers, becoming a doctor, battling Rambo style in Afghanistan, surviving a prison tourture sequence so elaborate it seems lifted from \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", saving white babes from sexual slavery, kung fu fighting a pack of wild dogs and becoming a kind of Bombay Don Corleone, Roberts also finds time to slip \\"the meaning of life\\" ( a kind of masala mix of Hinduism and Stephen Hawkings) into a single chapter. <br /> <br />This book is dreadful, and the worst thing is that some reveiwers have touted it as a great book about India. This is an Indian story in as much as Tarzan was a great African story or \\"Dances with Wolves' was a history of the Sioux Nation. India, and Indians are pretty much window dressing to Roberts boy's own adventure here. <br /> <br />If you want to read about India, read some Indian authors like Raj Khamal Jha or Amitav Ghosh.. If you are interested in a foreigners experience of Asian cultures, check out David Mitchell... but if you want trash like Shantaram, rent a copy of Bollywood cheese like Mission: Kashmir, it will waste a lot less time than this...
B000A88F22|1.0|Most likely hardcore britney fans who can't see past their idol's fake facade. This whole reality show was britney & Kevin making complete asses out of themselves. It shows what a ditzy, unintelligent, childish person britney is & I just love how the entire time that they are covorting around having a jolly old time, they are ignoring the fact the Kevin has a girlfriend back home who's pregnant with there second child. They wanna act like this is some fairy tale relationship instead of what it really is: britney was so depressed, lonely & desperate that she shacked up with the first loser who caught her eye & it just so happened to be a two-timing jobless one who let this dumb naive rich girl spend lots of money on him so he would stay by her side. britney also continues with her usual hypocrocy. She constantly complains about having no privacy & being exploited by the press & wanting a private life but then turns around & does a reality about her white trash relationship, not to mention she's done four People Weekly cover stories about her & Kevin's engagement, her step child, her wedding, her baby shower & then when her baby's born, she'll exploit him/her too. The girl loves attention & despite her pleas that she doesn't, the evidence points to the contrary!
1594200440|3.0|Had things not become so ridiculous toward the end, I would have taken this generally well written book much more seriously.   <br /> <br />The characters are interesting, as are their stories, and truth be told, I am still thinking about them and mulling over the book 2 weeks later.  It's not what I thought it would be on many levels, but it is a good reminder of what Stalin did to the Ukraine and indeed,all of the former USSR.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Those who wrote such negative reviews(especially the person who called it \\"garbage\\") are obviously clueless bandwagon jumpers that have absolutely no understanding about Clapton. You don't compare \\"Back Home\\" to \\"Mr. Johnson\\", he has never been \\"just a bluesman\\"( see classic records from the 60's through the 90's). If you know EC at all, you know he always incorporates his love, the blues(which are present on \\"Back Home\\"), but his music is always his take, his own interpretation of what ever he plays. \\"Back Home\\" is actually vintage Clapton and where he is at right now. He's recovered from so many things throughout the years, but now he is a happy, healthy, creative family man. His music has never been better. Cream, BlindFaith, mastering with Duane Allman, have nothing to do with the present. <br /> \\"Back Home\\" is masterful, personal and by far the best music that anyone has produced this year. I find it interesting that the detractors of this record, failed to even mention the incredible \\"cover\\" of \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" written by his \\"mate\\" George Harrison. Only EC could have done such a extraordinary tribute to his friend, by imitating George's style on this fabulous song. <br /> Buy this disc if you like Clapton. What ever you do, don't listen to ignorant critics, pretending to be knowledgeable fans of EC. <br />
B000AP04EW|5.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith start with a couple at a marriage counselor's office. I remember me thinking - another sleeper.  I was quickly proven wrong as the couple goes down \\"memory lane\\". <br /> <br />They seem like a normal couple BUT they are far from ordinary.  We discover that John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are assassins working for rival companies. However, the couple doesn't know each other's secret. They're married for 5 to 6 years (see the movie you'll get it). They find out each other's secret when sent on same assignment.  <br /> <br />The on-screen chemistry between Brad & Jolie was GREAT.  If you like action movies this movie has plenty.  The screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg and directed by Doug Liman. <br /> <br />I gave the movie 5 STARS. Mr. & Mrs. Smith were different from the typical movie plots in its category.  I must have Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I already preordered the movie via Amazon and can't wait until it's on DVD...
B000002AP1|5.0|This record delivers on all fronts - it is a sonic assault and Iggy is there to explain how the world really is . <br />The band makes him sound even meaner - the music is a threat . <br />The matter of fact lyrics tell the story of a tough world where the rules are made by the Stooges . <br /> <br />Check it out - let the Stooges show you the truth ! <br />A classic - the band are one of a kind.
0064471837|5.0|I thought that Sabriel, along with Lirael and Abhorsen, were delightful fantasy novels. They were a refreshing change in fantasy writing. Throughout the books I found the characters thouroughly developed, if not with an air of mystery. I found the plot very well developed and engrossing and give it a high reccomendation.
0142001104|5.0|This book really makes available new and powerful distinctions, with practices to back them up. Applicable into the corporate envireonment, into the personal domain - thouroughly uplifting, inspiring and downright practical. More than worth the time and money.
B0007OASII|1.0|I don't know what I was thinking,this is a horriable album.The singer Khan has a bad voice.This album is slow and boring. <br />March Of Mephisto has the Dimmu Borgir singer on it(awful).There is nothing good about this album,it's annoying.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|Eric Clapton is always trying new things out on every album. As I am a wannabe musician I appreciate his constant journey in trying out new things musically. It doesnt mean that it sounds good every time but experimenting with what interests you is what keeps the passion alive for a musician and their love for music (whatever moves you) and that is exactly what Eric is doing :)<br /><br />Anyways most of this album is really not to my taste but there are a few good tracks and you have to listen to it once or twice to get a feel for it. Much of the album is a much happier mood for Clapton which he admits is due in part to his new family.<br /><br />If you like the old soul music of the 60's and 70's and alot of sappy love songs then this album may be pleasing to your ear, if your looking for guitar acrobatics you have come to the wrong place.<br /><br />Key Tracks to listen to are:<br /><br />\\"Love dont love nobody\\" (Clapton trying to be a soul singer to the Al green, Sam and Dave, Ray Charles style. I was actually very impressed with his attempt at soul singing acrobatics on this)<br /><br />\\"One Day\\" (This is my favorite track on the album which I constantly listen to, co-written with  Country artist Vince Gill I believe. Its as close as youll get to bluesy rock on this album)<br /><br />\\"One Track Mind\\" (this song is a bit to poppy soul for me but its catchy as hell)<br /><br />\\"Back Home\\" very soul searching kind of song, its a good track you can tell clapton just wants to settle down and retire.<br /><br />-Eric Clapton has tired of his guitar tricks and is focusing on singing like a soul singer. Thats his cup of tea now so let him enjoy it.<br /><br />I recently read an interview where it seemed Clapton had basically thrown away the idea of guitar solos as being pointless without a song to back it up.<br /><br />While some of this statement is true, I was a tad upset to read this as this is what made Eric Clapton the musician he is.<br /><br />People love him for the way he can play a guitar solo it was like a singer spilling their guts out vocally he did on guitar.<br /><br />I dont think he understands how emotional and powerful his guitar solos can be, its like hes embarrased of what he did before.<br /><br />Anyways if you appreciate Eric Clapton for his versatility as an artist and are open minded I think you will enjoy this album, definitely an album to kick back to if you are in a good mood rather than the blues../> <br />People love him for the way he can play a guitar solo it was like a singer spilling their guts out vocally he did on guitar.  <br /> <br />I dont think he understands how emotional and powerful his guitar solos can be, its like hes embarrased of what he did before. <br /> <br /> <br />Anyways if you appreciate Eric Clapton for his versatility as an artist and are open minded I think you will enjoy this album, definitely an album to kick back to if you are in a good mood rather than the blues.. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|This is rammstein's best album since Sehnsucht, this has more of a gothic sense to it especially added to it's dark ochestra sound that gives it more of a brutal sound especially to some songs. Reise,Reise kicks this album off and sets the tone for a Rammstein classic. Mein Teil reminds me of Angel of Death by Slayer because of its cynical storyline which if you know the story about a German cannibal who ate a willing victim after feasting on the man's hoo hoo dilly together. Possibly one of the best known songs here is Onhe Dich( Without You) is a semi tragic story about love. Other songs here are also good but all I need to tell you that if you feel skeptical about buying into Rammstein just remember that there are websites that give you translations and you could see that they actually write great songs.
B0006399FS|4.0|What a fantastic album. I thought U2 would never top their 2000 masterpiece, All That You Can't Leave Behind. But they did. In many ways, this might be U2's best album todate. While The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby have a more 'classic album' feel to them but HTDAB has all good songs. \\"Vertigo\\" is one of their best singles ever. U2 never made a bad album...and they prove their presence in the rock world with this stunning release.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was at a friends house, and I tried to sleep through it since I didn't get much sleep the night before.  I couldn't get to sleep though - mostly because the TV was so loud - but also, I thought the movie was fairly interesting.<br /><br />When I saw this movie available EVERYWHERE in London I couldn't resist buying it, and I got it for a slim price.  (I lucked out because everything else there is expensive as heck.)  I was disappointed to see that it wouldn't play on my Playstation 2 since it was a UK disc.  Fortunately, after some slight modifications, I could still watch it on the DVD player I had on my computer.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that this movie had a lot more cussing in it than I remember.  I also noticed that it didn't show my favorite character Frank all that much.  Still, I think this movie is a great thing to see.  It's about a kid in high school with severe mental problems, so it's not very unusual.  This kid's name is Donnie Darko.<br /><br />Donnie has hallucinations and personality disorders and darn near every mental disorder a person can have.  He goes to a shrink and takes lots of meds.  Does this help?  Of course not, why would anyone expect it to?  I'm sure it costs the parents a lot of money, but they seem more concerned for their wacko son than for saving up some dough.<br /><br />Well, Donnie has this imaginary friend named Frank that tells him when the world is going to end; 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.  Frank isn't a a Kool-Aid drinker though, he's just a guy in a bunny rabbit skull costume that looks really boss and evil.<br /><br />So Donnie goes through school and cusses out teachers and picks up this gothic-type chick.  Naturally he doesn't get expelled or anything.  Under the influence of Frank, Donnie develops an interest in time travel and studies it.  His main book of reference is written by a weird old lady who does nothing but check a mailbox all day.  She must have been looking for a check or something.<br /><br />In a short subplot, Donnie burns down the home of a child pornography peddler.  This happens right after my favorite scene in the movie where Frank takes off his mask.  The Frank unmasking scene is spooky, with really dark classical music playing in the background.  I love it.  Frank turns out to be pretty darn ugly.<br /><br />The film has an excellent soundtrack including one of my favorite songs, \\"Head Over Heels.\\"  The cinematography can't be any better.  It's very dark throughout but not so dark that you can't see.  Even when it's bright daylight outside, the movie manages to keep its dark feeling.<br /><br />The movie is kind of written like a Star Trek episode with all of the time traveling business.  I'm not sure if it's 100% consistent, but with a vague and complicated subject like time travel, you can get away with inconsistency, since time travel is so darn neat.<br /><br />If you're into weird stuff, you need to see this movie.  It's got a lot of imagination put into it, and I think everybody can appreciate that.ust have been looking for a check or something. <br /> <br />In a short subplot, Donnie burns down the home of a child pornography peddler.

B00008YLV2|5.0|The movie itself is just great. The cinematography is unbelieveable. <br /> <br />The DVD is jam-packed with lots of stuff. Pictures, doucmentaries, commentaries, etc. The only thing I felt that they should have put in there was soundtrack...but that's ok.  <br /> <br />This is a great buy, if you liked the movie you should get this.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Always loved this movie and now it has extra scenes that were not included in the original.  This is a great family movie.
2253005274|4.0|I read this book back in high school because I was intrigued by the title (\\"The Wanderer\\"). I enjoyed it at the time, and through the years I always remembered it as one that really resonated with my gloomy adolescent mind.<br /><br />Feeling nostalgic recently, I located a used copy and read it again, trying to recapture whatever it was that had engaged me so many years before. It was interesting to experience the same story from a more seasoned perspective in life. It was not as deep as it had once seemed to me in youth, and yet I noticed and understood many nuances and details that had been opaque to my teenage mind.  In a way this parallels the story in the novel.  Youth imagines what maturity never sees, and maturity knows what youth never imagined.<br /><br />The edition I bought included a short biography of the author, who was killed in WWI - this was his only book. It was interesting that the story of the lost love was based on real events in Alain Fournier's short life. It is a glimpse into just one young life that was snuffed out by war, all future promise never to be revealed. As such, it is a story which is nearly as wistful and sad as the novel itself. Just as one wonders \\"what could have been\\" if Meaulnes got the girl, so we wonder what other novels Fournier might have gone on to write, had he not been buried beneath the sod of Europe.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|its a shame that it only ran one season, but im greatfull it made a movie
B000268QB2|3.0|My general rule for buying a CD is the three song rule (if I like three songs on an album I buy it), but with Keane, I went out on a limb and bought it having only liked two (Somewhere and Everybody's Changing).  I expected the album to keep up with the good rythyms, simple melodies and upbeat tune, which it did, but sadly, with very little variety. Most of the songs sound the same which is great if you really like their songs. <br />Towards the end of the album, their songs become more morose and I usually don't listen to those. The first five, however, are pretty fun.  Definately sample this CD before you buy it. <br />If you are into the British easy rock, I might stick with Cold Play or give Jamie Cullum a try.  He's really great and you won't find variety lacking on his album, Twentysomething. <br />
B00000G3I2|4.0|A group of 1960s college idealists and friends meet one weekend in the early '80s after the death of another in the group. By now most of them have chucked those old ideals and are into making money. They talk a lot, about the old days and the new, and we see how much their lives have changed - none for the better, really. William Hurt is excellent as the cynic of the group, a wounded Vietnam vet now incapable of having sex. There are some great lines here in the dialogue, even though many have a cutesy-clever ring to them, with a drumroll delivery. It's kind of stagey and somewhat pretentious, but for anyone who's been there and can relate to the overall message it's never a bore to watch. The Motown music track, heard prominently throughut the movie, for many is a huge plus; it sort of worked against the movie for me. Many of the actors  springboarded from here to star status: Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Glenn Close, and Kevin Kline in particular. Worth a watch.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I give the film 5 stars, this so called new edition 0 stars. Whats new about it? Doesn't even list all the specs. The other version, (green cover), is remastered, and has a ton of extras and 5.1 dolby digital sound. If the only difference is that the cover is now blue and the ghosts now have eyeholes, I'm repulsed. Are they reissuing this now because the remake will be released at the same time? One of the worst marketing ripoffs, I have ever heard of. What next, a red cover in six months? They cannot even get the cover right, the original has Jamie Lee pressed up against a door. Save your money on this greedy reissue.
0061015725|4.0|This book was an all around good book.  Some parts were a little boring, but in the end it turns out to be a good book.  If you read this book it is very much time well spent.  In my opinion you don't get much out of this book, I mean yeah it's a very good book but you don't really get anything out of it.  The strengths of this book are that it's very suspenseful, like you never know what is going to happen next.  A weakness is taht in some parts it becomes very scientific and boring.  My recommendations on who should read this book, are people who are into or like science or if your just looking for a good read.  I erally do not know of any books taht are similar to PREY, considering this is the first time i've ever read a book of this genre.
B00006ADG8|5.0|A very fine adaptation of Herman Melville's story of morality and the law aboard an English man-of-war in 1797. Peter Ustinov is Captain Vere, who believes the code of his office is the only one to live by, which makes no room for human judgment or conscience. Terence Stamp is the naive, innocent, Christ-like Budd, who kills the sadistic master-at-arms Robert Ryan out of self-defense when his stammer prevents him from talking. Melvyn Douglas is the self-loathing Claggart. Everyone is superb, and the script is faithful to the original. There is much to ponder about here, and repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment and inner searching. Highly recommended.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|No shoe gazers were these guys.  Long before the moronic sludge of Seattle grunge music filled the airwaves, Accept ruled the world as the reigning bad boys of heavy metal rock, or \\"thunder rock\\" as it was called in Germany, back in the mid '80s.  Accept it.  This band were bad as all get-out.  Bad as in good.  Like Huey Lewis once said, also in the mid '80s. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"London Leatherboys\\" and \\"Turn Me On\\" rival Zeppelin and the Doors as some of the best musical creations of humankind.  People might make fun of Accept's hair and bulgey crotches, but the truth is, no one produced more searing anthems than these German blokes.   <br /> <br />I'm looking through Circus magazine right now and Accept is in the \\"Shooting Stars\\" section.  The article says they are a \\"tight band with the golden locks to slay the gals!\\"  I don't doubt the locks and the licks, but I'm wondering when Accept will indeed become stars on MTV. <br /> <br />Oh wait...this Circus issue is from June 1984.  Well, I'm sure Accept will rise to the top soon enough.  Keep requesting Accept on your local radio stations, and we'll see 'em on MTV yet!!  Hopefully behind the sound, astute commentary of VJ Adam Curry!!  How cool would that be?!?!? <br /> <br />Accept this band.  Then move on.   <br /> <br />GOODBYE TO ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000041BX|3.0|When I like a body of work by a composer, I collect many different recordings.  For me, Schubert's late string quartets are perfect.  I own several versions including the Melos Quartet and the Auryn Quartet.  This Philips recording is a recent addition, and while it is a fair value, the sound is mediocre and the interpretation is irritating to me(every movement is slow, slow, slow). <br /> <br />Try to find a copy of the Auryn Quartet if you can.  The recordings are magnificent and the music is perfect.

B000A3DFZE|1.0|I really hate to give this record only one star. Like one reviewer just said, eric was coming off the cream reunion and a really good Robert Johnson record and tour, and maybe we were expecting a corner turn in his somewhat laid back studio attempts over the last few years (reptile, pilgrim). This record makes those seem energetic. Lets face it. Eric is a great talent, but people should know where their strenghts lie. Songwriting was never a real strong suit for him. We all know that his strenght lies in his guitar and in his love for the blues. None of these are present on this disc. His tales of domesticity in these tunes are almost downright depressing. I know that people are ''so tired '' when they have kids. Every parent knows already. What we need is to be uplifted. And this record falls way short.
B000008LOV|5.0|I love this album. <br />George Harrison and \\"great company\\" are in top form. <br />Fun and relaxed. <br />But music is great and it is balsam for my ears. <br />Good arrangements, no sentiment, but true music. <br />I think that this is the best album of any ex-beatle produced in the 80's. But it is must for Dylan, Orbison, Petty and Lynne fans too. <br />Highly recommend.
B00000ING2|5.0|People see a lot of different things in this movie. To me it's about big wheels and zeros, circles, cycles, cogs and clockwork; R O T and the O stands for nothing; aum and the omphalos; karma, the wheel of fortune, the daily mill, what goes around comes around; the zodiac, the turning year, rise and fall (or fail); flying plastic saucers, plastic hoops and straws, halos, hoopla; spin doctors; up and down, round and round, bulls and bears, black and white, good and evil; the nature of time, the future of the past, and when is now?

I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading it, but before long I was completely transported into the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The language is so beautiful throughout the book, and although I found it a bit awkward to read at first I quickly adjusted to it. I can easily see why this book is considered a classic and I highly recommend it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Of course the movie deserves 4 stars, however I wish I could say the same for the DVD. What does it take for DVD company to release each DVD enhanced for 16x9 TVs? Nothing!  <br /> <br />Recently I bought a SONY BRAVIA 32 INCH display and I have a collection of over 600 Dvds. I learned now about \\"Enhanced for 16x9 TVs\\" and how important it is, I did not care about it or even know about it since I own a standard TV, however all my Dvds are Region 1 and in widescreen, I never buy fullscreen Dvds. So I did an inventory on my collection and realized the following:  <br /> <br />Out of 600+ Dvds, 42 are NOT enhanced for 16x9 TVs and they really look horrible when I played them on my PC.

B0007OCG56|5.0|I'd heard about this movie, and it didn't sound like it was compatible with my interests.  But after reading some of the reviews here at Amazon, I rented it and watched it, and now I own it, and more; I treasure it.  This is a surprisingly wonderful glimpse into the life of a family where two cultures collide.  The story here is about life, and love, and committment.  But mostly it's a story of a mother and her daughter, with a little shot of another typical white upper middle class family who outwardly appear successful but inwardly everything is much like roses, beautiful but with thorns.  Adam Sandler is stunning here not as a comedian, but with just enough humor in his role to make this his coup de grace peformance.  This is one of those movies that make you feel good about life that lifts your spirit and defines the essence of our being.  I loved it!  Kudo's to the writers, the directors, the actors and actresses!!!  Bravo! Encore!  Thank You for a wonderful film.
B00015YVDG|5.0|Of course the movie deserves 4 stars, however I wish I could say the same for the DVD. What does it take for DVD company to release each DVD enhanced for 16x9 TVs?

B000002JSP|4.0|This seems to be a love it/hate it album. Those who hate it complain of the synths and keyboards, but LZ used Jones' keyboard talents throughout their career - those weren't flutes on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". Synths weren't used earlier simply because the only ones available then were RCA Labs wall-o'-knobs Moogs with their LAN wiring-closet of patch cords and drifting osc's. But there always were plenty of mellotrons and clavinets. <br /> <br />Another reason for the different sound of this album, if I recall my \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" correctly, is that Page was, at the time...how to put this delicately...more consistantly 'in the arms of Morpheus' is how the book phrases it. Someone had to step in and fill the gap, and that someone was John Paul Jones, who always had a lot more creative input than he's been given credit. <br /> <br />In the Evening - Classic, loud, mid-tempo LZ, although Jones plays a keyboard rhythm instead of Page recording a 4th or 5th guitar track. And how does Page make his guitar sound like a motorcycle starting up? <br /> <br />Southbound Suarez - who can resist its stomping honky-tonk pulse and Page's counterpoint guitar slide? It's almost as an endurance song as \\"Rock & Roll\\". <br /> <br />Fool in the Rain - it's hard to review this song and not penalize it because of its being one of only three LZ songs classic rock stations play anymore, and therefore is a bit tiresome. Except for an electronically-doubled solo, what few guitars there are are buried behind the piano in the mix. But, hey - Plant is actually singing a melody. The song dissolves into an odd off-the-wall samba in the middle; Bonham must have just been sent some rotos he wanted to play with. <br /> <br />Hot Dog - Hillbilly Led Zepplin rebel-rock. But it's better than its reputation, and if taken with a grain of humor, it's a lot of fun. LZ  wasn't always just about the torment and depression of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" or \\"I Can't Quit You\\". <br /> <br />Carouselambra - in the the original CD release this song's levels were down about 1/3; it almost sounded like a different album. The remastered CD punches it up and brightens it considerably, although I still had to go online to figure out what Plant was saying. Page's guitars yield the spotlight to Jones' synth playing and typical virtuoso bass lines. Bonham drumming is more restrained than some of the other 10.5-minute studio-jam sessions like \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\". But a restrained Bonham is twice the drummer of anybody in the business today, except for Neil Peart or Mike Portnoy. \\"Carouselambra\\" twists and morphs though several mood changes and slowly fades out like it's the last song on the album... <br /> <br />All My Love - My least favorite on the album, although I am well aware of its subject. It's not bad, but something had to be the least. And it's not helped by being another of the only three Led Zeppelin Songs That Classic Rock Stations Ever, Ever Play. Jones' keyboards and Page's single (!) rhythm guitar track set the mood, and Jones' nice solo gives the song an Eastern flavor you never knew was there. <br /> <br />I'm Gonna Crawl - Starts out with another fluffy string synth intro, then Bonham's big bluesy bass drum kicks in and you know this is going to be LZ classic cry-in-your-beer woman-done-left-me wrencher. Nobody does it better.

B0009SS00A|2.0|I've been in the IT field for over 20 years, and cannot read a book or watch a movie or TV show that has anything to do with computers as its central theme. No one ever gets it right, and I'm not talking small details that just the bit-counters might see. I'm talking about the classic eye-rollers like the \\"I know this - it's UNIX!\\" line in Jurassic Park I, the whole concept of a podunk little Apple laptop infecting an alien armada in \\"Independence Day\\" (as though the aliens got here by pedalling), up to the standard Hollywood corndoggery of beeping character displays, big walls of blinky lights, and credit-thrashing, Internet-savvy children.    But 'The DaVinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' were fun enough reads - historical and geographical romps with a few stretched but interesting concepts and conclusions. So against my normally better judgement, I tried Digital Fortress...    So you're not in a computer-related field - would the book stand on its story? Not really. Some of the concepts required a suspension of disbelief along the scope of the latest superhero flavor-of-the-month movie. Not good if you want a book grounded in reality - in fantasy, where the rules of the world are made up, where's the suspense? You just \\"make up\\" a resolution, and then roll credits.. There was also a great deal of \\"Quick! To the Bat Cave!\\"-type urgent dashing about, characters whose lives were in danger whom I didn't care about, and a long d----r----a-----w----n-out ending where the super-villain stumps shiny, pointy-headed, over-achieving, heavily-degreed intellectuals with a question anybody remotely familiar with WWII would know. Not only do they not know the answer, they don't even understand the question. Until, of course, it's convenient for the plot that they finally and breathlessly do.    Dan Brown could do better. Dan Brown HAS done better.
0142800821|4.0|I am a grammar and punctuation buff, having taught the stuff many years ago, and I found the book to be a refreshing approach to the whole business which apparently has been put on the far back burner. Our culture obviouslyy doesn't know how to puctuate and, furthermore, shrugs it off as unimportant. The first half of the book is especially refreshing; the last goes slower. I keep lending my copy out to friends who delight in it.
0780626966|5.0|I do own the DVD box set and I suggest that anyone who's a Nightmare on Elm Street fan to buy the box set. The movies look so clear on DVD, there's a cool dics that comes with it and you'll never get tired of watching it. I like every NOE except 5 & 6. It seemed like they tried to make Freddy a comedian, if your gonna make a horror movie don't make your main character funny it just doesn't work. Freddy vs Jason was alright, I just didn't like the acting in the movie and the storyline was too short. I do still enjoy watching all of those movies.
0066620996|1.0|Fannie Mae is the first company author considers. The stock price of Fannie Mae keeps rising until the book was published. After that it has been falling and still counting. Currently the rating of the stock is neutral.<br /><br />Gillette, an almost monopoly in the shaving market, ceased to exist.<br /><br />Circuit City's stock prices have fallen from 40$ at the time the book was written to 20$ now.<br /><br />Abott Lab's prices have not risen in the past seven years either.  Seven year is about half the time frame the author has used to arrive at his great companies.<br /><br />Besides a spike in the late half of year 2004, the Nucor corps share prices for the past 15 year have shown no rising trend. I believe, and the author would agree, thats a good enough period for observation of a company's health.<br /><br />All in all, post publication, the companies don't seem to be doing all that great, average at best.<br /><br />For every logical conjecture behind success there is an alternate argument. A bunch of salt is recommended. This book certainly ain't a beyond time work.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses debut Appetite For Destruction is one of the greatest albums in rock history, rivaling, maybe eclipsing, the best music of Zeppelin, Aerosmith, even the Stones. Rising out of the L.A. metal glam scene of the mid-eighties they wrote songs that dealt with drug addiction, paranoia, urban decay, explicit sex, and salvation. Popular music in the eighties was slick, pre-packaged, heavily produced, relying more on image than musical talent. What sounded so fresh about G N' R was that they could actually play their instruments. The music was genuine and raged with passion and ferocity. While the band pulled no punches exposing the depravity of Hollywood street life they also embraced tenderness and idealism. The music bangs, crashes, and boogies with a subversive punk rock attitude. Appetite's best tracks 'Welcolme To The Jungle', Paradise City' or 'Sweet Child O' Mine' are classic arena rock anthems. Millions of teenagers identified with Axl Rose as he railed against a society he viewed as corrupt and out to exploit him. Slash's elegaic solos soar over Izzy Stradlin's tough R&B inflected riffing. And the devil mare care rhythm section of Duff McCagen and Steven Adler achieve a perfect balance between remaining tight but loose. If your a fan of hard rock your collection isn't complete without a copy of Appetite.
B000B5IPDI|4.0|Will be the previusly released edition on it?<br /><br />or it's a whole new cut of the film?
B00005ARDC|5.0|Fusy,Dark,Rockin' and Heartfelt is what Black Rebal Motorcycle Club brings to the table on there first atempt and let's just say they left a damn good mark because I don't know one person who likes these guys who sayes there NOT one of there favorite bands ever! Stange but true, at first listen to any of there song's off any of there albums when you first hear it...it's like \\".....what,what was that?\\". Truely great song wrighters of our time these young straping gentlemen are and they better keep making music for years to come trust the hype because then you won't miss out.
0066214122|3.0|Overall the book Prey was not terribly bad, but it also wasn't that good either.  It wasn't boring to have to read it and it was better than some books I have read.  Some of the things in the book that I liked are the fact that it seems so much more technologically advanced then this day in age.  I also like the writing style and how the book was setup.  Some things in the book I didn't like are how the nanobots killed people.  I thought that was pretty stupid and was such a basic thing to do, especially considering how the nanobots were so smart and cunning.  I also didn't like how they altered there form and how they would change and morph.  By doing this, it makes the nanobots seem like a creature or animal, not a robot.  They became more like an organic creature. I would recommend this book to people who are into technology and who like science because that is what the book is basically all about.  Overall that's what I thought of the book.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|To good to be true i wasn't expecting this but heck....not to shaby,not to shaby at all. Every track is fantastic the more you listen to these guys the more you like them. I don't know what it is about them but it's really adictive even though this whole album is basically acoustic (which is still cool). Check out the new hype because it's Black Rebel Motorcycle Club
B0002OERI0|5.0|Before I proceed to the actuall review, I would like to say that you people need to shut up. The punk rock scene has gone to hell because stupid fans who think they're better then everyone because they knew bands before anyone else. It's sad. All I want to say is that Green Day has not sold out. So what, they have there videos on MTV, who cares? Is that the point of being in the band, the fame, the glory, the glamour? This album can be ruled as pure lyrical genius (sitting next to MCR's Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, disagree, tough luck. Revenge has a good story to it). So here's the review. <br /> <br />American Idiot, a album involving the story of man who tries to find himself amidst the confusion that is America today. Not really a protest album, but not really Kerplunk, the album tells the tale of the Jesus of Suburbia. It opens with American Idiot, a song about how the American probaganda is changing everyone and anyone and how confusion if formed in America. Overall, a good energetic track. After American Idiot, comes the 9 minute epic, Jesus of Suburbia. The track gives you a little background on the Jesus of Suburbia (who apparently, was a victim towards rape) and shows Green Day's great musicanship. After that the protest song Holiday comes on. The bridge of the song is very powerfull and full of meaning. The song forms into Boulevard of Broken Dreams, which is a pretty decent song no matter how much it's played.  <br /> <br />The sorta interlude, Are We The Waiting, shows the amount of musianship that went into the album, using three guitars. The song throws you into Saint Jimmy, where the Jesus of Suburbia turns into is shell, known as Saint Jimmy. Very energetic and has a \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\" fell mixed with \\"Having a Blast\\". Give Me Novicane, a.k.a. the Drug Song, starts out slow and kicks it up on the energy level and then transform to She's a Rebel which has a \\"She\\" and \\"Pulling Teeth\\" sorta fell to it. After that comes Extrodinary Girl, which takes a while to grow on you, but overall, a decent track.  <br /> <br />After that comes Letterbomb, not really a protest song that people hype it up to be. I just adore the lyrics to this song aswell. After that, the song about Billie Joe's father, Wake Me Up When September Ends. I'm going to go a little offtopic here on the review and discuss the video a little bit. One, it's not really a protest video. It shows that some kids, who think they're doing the right thing by joining the military are dying before living there lives. Overall, a good song. After that is Homecoming. The second epic, I just love this song. Espically Part Three: Nobody Likes You. After the epic is Whatshername, which is a excellent closer to the album and story behind American Idiot.
0385474547|5.0|I was exposed to this book by a great mentor of mine.  this book tells story and spirit of the african tribe in umuofia that is crushed by the european imperialist; the slow and continuing death of many tribes throughout africa.  the unique part of this book, was that it was not shaped like regular western literature, with the plot, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution, it was in fact unique in its own way, that instead of a continuring line plot, it was more of a spiral, that just decended. sorta hard to explain, just read the book!!  sorta makes sense why the title is \\"things fall apart\\" and also chinua achebe got it from a poem.  theres so much dept to this book, dont be fooled by the appearance, and that its only a hundred pages long, its such a great book.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|How this album got about an overall 4 stars I don't know. It's just a horrible album. I personally think she can't sing or write good songs. She tries to be so serious but when she does it's almost laughable-no. wait...it is! Anyone who thinks this is the best album ever seriously has to check their ears. For anyone thinking of buying this album-DON'T, just don't waste your money on this cd. If I could I would give this 0 stars-take it from me-a music fan.
0140288503|5.0|such a compelling book. trully an intense and graphic book.  Makes one feel as if they are actually crawling out of the streets of mogadishu.  Mark Bowden is a great author that did alot of research on the events that happened in the black market of somalia.  i suggest killing pablo as well.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is a great album.  Buy it now.  It speaks for itself.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Well, I would give this DVD 4 of 5 stars, because it was an interesting & accurate 'feeling' depiction of what the movie makers were trying to convey:  A fairly outlandish idea that dragons have been unearthed & devastated the planet, leaving survivors desperate.  I don't know what gym Matthew M works out at, but I want to join!  The guy is CUT UP & puts on an out-of-character performance... I was expecting some sort of whimpy \\"Contact\\"-style performance... No way. <br /> <br />This is a good film for young & old, I liked it, my kids LOVED it, and if you have 7+ yr olds who are into dragons, definitely get it.
B00004I9VE|5.0|Why doesn't this have 5 stars?  Oh, that's right, because we have stupid people(that are afraid to post their name), taking the time out of their pathetic lives to come onto Amazon.com and spread hate and ignorance.  You people are pathetic(Yeah I said \\"pathetic\\" again b*tch, that's the best word to describe you.  \\"Stupid\\", \\"ignorant\\", and \\"ridiculous\\" also work nicely.  Now f*ck off.). <br /> <br />Anyway.  This is a great album.  A definite classic.  Buy it now.
B000A59PMO|5.0|The acting, writing and directing throughout the first season of the show was nothing short of phenomenal.  Never once during the show did I get really bothered by a terrible piece of dialogue, a poor acting job, or bad direction of the episode.  I don't know that I can say the same about any other show. <br /> <br />Right from the get go this show had me hooked.  I love season long story arcs, and the way they kept the Lilly Kane murder story alive was brilliant.  Rather than touch on it every few weeks by dedicating a whole episode, they touched on it a little bit in almost every one!  It was just enough to raise new questions, but not quite enough to let you figure it out.  I kept wanting more and more!
B000002KNI|5.0|I attended this show in Central Park. The sound is so clear and captures the spirit of that late summer night in New York which I got to spend with 500,000 of my closest friends. I was right up front and with the height of the stage I could only really see the top of Art's head, so listening to the album without actually seeing S&G is (in the words of Yogi Berra) like \\"deja vu all over again. A most enjoyable celebration of the music of one of America's true musical treasures!
B00006V9A0|1.0|I hate Greatest Hits albums, especially ones with almost nothing original to offer, released only to make money. <br />BOYCOT THIS ALBUM. If you want Nirvana get all the studio albums (except for Bleach if you only like their hits) <br />What the hell is \\"You know you're right\\" doing here, it should have been on the boxset!!!

B0007Y4TVU|2.0|I was really excited about the new System of a Down album when I heard it was coming out, and when I got it I was really disappointed. I listened to it over and over thinking I would eventually get into the CD but I couldn't. The CD does have some decent tracks. Not great but decent. Compared to the previous System of a Down albums this one is crap. If I could get my money back I would.
B000AP04MO|3.0|Folks who've seen any movie featuring either Albert Finney or Audrey Hepburn are likely to be sold on Two For The Road before it starts. Sweetening the promise is Stanley Donen in the director's chair, having previously directed Hepburn in 1963's wildly intriguing and stylish CHARADE. Donen appears to be trading on viewers' appreciation for CHARADE when he opens this film with another animated, 60's/Austin Powers-style title sequence, but that's the last similarity - until you start to notice that a fair amount of time is ticking by...    We are introduced to Finney and Hepburn as a bored, wealthy couple waiting to board an air ferry over the English channel. Finney's Mark Wallace, a successful architect, does not conceal his disenchantment with his wife and she does not conceal her frustration with him. The fading relationship is not a new literary device, and the dullened question of \\"how did we get here\\" doesn't pave a way for break-through cinema, so the film takes rather a gamble by launching into a 90-minute flashback to tell us the whole, sprawling story of this couple - before it's gotten us to care about them.    Nonetheless, average moviegoer patience should be enough to keep one focused long enough to notice the charm and the edginess of these characters, whetting our appetite for the ongoing sass of courtship. As a relationship unfurls, we are taken on road trips through Europe, to quaint bed-and-breakfasts in the French countryside, to wealthy people's estates - these elements alone tend to captivate American audiences even without regard to the dyad of titanic thespian talent in the foreground. But beware Americans, we are portrayed most unflatteringly in the personages of Howard and Cathy Manchester, a shamelessly modern couple (played with sheer mastery by William Daniels and Eleanor Bron) with whom Finney and Hepburn find themselves sharing an overly regimented road trip (to Howard's timekeeper objections to leaving \\"the main road\\", Finney rants, \\"Ishould warn you Howard, before we get to Athens, that the Acropolis is OFF THE MAIN ROAD\\").    Such satisfying jabs, and the more traditionally British dry wit, occur just often enough to sustain our interest in this picture, but oftentimes their occurrence reminds us that our interest needed refreshing.    All-in-all, this film gives us a nice dose of face-time with two of the most talented, enchanting actors in movie history, a leisurely dawdle through European countryside, and a little wink back in time to when America and Great Britain were embarking on something of a love affair of their own.    Like that affair, this one can be engaging, refreshing, boring, eye-opening, forced, unfounded, tiring, and worthwhile.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Chili's produce another stunning album with the return of guitarest john Frusciante. I like most rock bands from the nineties, such as Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Jane's Adiction, sound garden etc...., but the Chili Peppers just leave them standing in the past. Their music is individual, blending raw emotion with funky guitar riffs. And if this isn't enough to sway your views they are made all the more deserving by the death of their first guitarist, Hillel Slovak, and they still mannaged to come back stronger and create some on the most original and inventive music ever.  <br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers will always be remembered as one of the most entertaining bands ever, rivaling The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. <br />
B00005JODA|4.0|I thought the movie was great and worthy of the praise it has been getting from audiences and critics alike. Ralph Fiennes gives the performance of his career as a grieving man looking for answers and Rachel Weisz steals the film whole heartily with a really deserving Oscar worthy performance as a human rights activist. The story is pretty scary and the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, the shaky camera can get in the way but it's not distracting enough to ruin the film. <br /> <br />If you want to see a movie that will make you think, this is it. <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|The second album got out in 1984, the first album with Kirk Hammett that joined after Dave Mustaine was kicked out, although he had a part of this album in two of the songs. This was actually my first introduction to real metal (not nu-metal, metalcore or hair-metal), and pretty much like The Wickerman this instantly became my favorite album, it's no longer but it certainly ranks in my top 20 favorite albums. This is how metal should sound like. Blazing solos, vocals, energy, it slows down only for one song (Fade to Black).    Song Ratings:    Fight Fire With Fire (9/10): Good start-off. Not as great as 'Battery', 'Blackened' and 'Enter Sandman', but still great. It took time to grow on my but now I like it.    Ride the Lightning (20/10): Call me crazy but this is my all time fav 'Tallica song. IMO this song gets far too little credit since I rarely hear people praise song. The lyrics are about someone who is going to be executed and the solo is probably the best I've heard from the band.    For Whom The Bell Tolls (10/10): Very slow but still heavy, It is one of few Metallica's songs without solo: This and all the songs on St Anger.    Fade to Black (10/10): Metallica's first ballad, powerful lyrics about suicide, I can play it on my guitar. And the solo in the end is incredible.    Trapped Under Ice (10/10): Very underrated. People tend to diss this song for some reason. Why? I don't know. Every solo before the verses is killer and the chorus is great.    Escape (8/10): Its the weakest on the album, but not bad as people say. You may ask why, the solo is kinda sloppy. However anything else is great, I especially like the siren in the end.    reeping Death (10/10): Great lyrics about the Exodus of Egypt.  The solo is one of the best Kirk ever put out. This also used to be my favorite song on the album, it's no longer but it still rocks.    Call of Ktulu (11/10): One of the best instrumentals I ever heard, it goes in the same scales, great riffs and another killer solo. This was also written by Mustaine.    All in all, this one of the best that metal has to offer. If you're a metalhead you must have this.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is an awesome cd.I like how he did the whole glam rock thing.I love every song.I absolutely love the cover picture. <br />  the best songs on here are Dope show,Mechanical Animals,Rock Is Dead,I don't like the drugs,The last day on earth,and Coma White.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|I love this movie, and I can almost love this DVD. The 200+minute documentary is amazingly in-depth in many aspects of the film, but is astonishingly deficient in one significant area: CASTING. Features on weapons, costumes, the conception and writing, visual effects are all extraordinarily in-depth on the level of the LOTR EEs, but with the exception of Oliver Reed (who unfortunately passed away during the filming), hardly anything else is mentioned about how the movie was cast. There was hardly or no mention at all about how major actors Russell Crowe, Richard Harris or Joaquin Phoenix were approached about doing this movie, and why they were chosen. In fact, there is no section of this documentary focusing on actors at all (again, except for Oliver Reed).  I think some details were mentioned here and there in the commentary, but it's absence from the main documentary is rather puzzling. It leaves a rather large void in what would have been one of the best documentaries on DVDs I've seen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We never saw the original broadcasts, but bought these at the urgings of a good friend. What a surprise - this is one of the most enjoyable, entertaining science fiction TV series we've ever seen. The characters are engaging, the \\"Western in space\\" setting is used well, and the effects are high-quality. And as our friend told us, \\"Even if you did watch it on TV when it was first shown, the DVD set is more complete, with unaired episodes, and with the story told in order instead of at the random whim of the broadcaster.\\"
B00068NVI4|4.0|YES is not for everyone, so now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the concert. I wish I had been there. They gave a tremendously committed effort to these songs and I loved every minute of the film. I don't quite get the complaints about the sound. I have a very good DVD 5.1 system and I found the sound well balanced, with an empahsis on the music making more than the concert experience. Ambient audience noise is muffled. Good. This ain't Springsteen. <br />From the signature Stravinsky quote through STARSHIP TROOPER, the intensity, humour and passion about this material comes across terrifically, and Steve Howe is an absolute wonder, even if he looks older than God Almighty. Knuckleheads 1/5 his age should play 1/5 as well. And Howe is very much the unsung hero of the history of YES. He plays the works of Peter Banks and Trevor Rabin with the same commitment as though he had been the composer. All of YES's most memorable moments have come courtesy of Howe's fleet command of the classics, jazz and rock and his incredible commitment to his instrument. There has never been a guiatrist quite like him. How could there be? Who else could make musical sense out of the naff lyrics of Jon Anderson? <br />Chris Squier is still looking for a sartorial genie. Hopelessly out of whack with any sense of fashion, he nevertheless commands his bass with authority and still has the choir boy vocal chops to fill out Anderson's still soaring vocals. Yes the key is lower than it used to be, but Anderson still soars where non-eunuchs fear to tread. White seems to be the picture of health and Wakeman looks like he's determined to make rehab work this time. In any case they cover the entire career, and along with the just published triple CD of concert takes, THE WORD IS LIVE, YES delivers a comprehensive review of an astoundingly creative 35 years. it will be interesting to see where they pick up after the brilliant ILLUMINATION CD/DVD of a couple years back. That CD seemed to point to a whole new direction, and given the positively energetic and brilliant SPECTRUM  released by Steve Howe this year, hopefully 2006 will see a new YES release. In any case, silly stage design and all, it is a great concert well filmed and mixed. You should enjoy this one.
0140544518|5.0|This is a funny little book about the wolf's version of \\"the three little pigs.\\" Kids will probably like this book because they can see the story from a different perspective. The drawings are very well done and colorfull.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|Left to his own devices, Clapton is never his own best friend musically. His first collection of pop songs since his efforts for Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Robert Johnson, as well as his own substance abuse clinic, this is not strong material, especially his stuff. The instrumentation is incredibly tight, but the material just never grabs you, but for one song, George Harrison's \\"Love Comes To Everyone.\\" The rest is not as treacly as your standrad Sting or Rod Stewart record, but after having had such a brilliant run with The Concert For New York, The Concert for George, Brainwashed, the two Robert Johnson CDs, the Guitarfest Concert, the One More Rider Live CD, BACK HOME is a disappointment and rather lifeless. Plus, I just can't wrap my aesthetic sensibilities around Clapton singing about changing nappies.... <br />It's just wrong.
B0000BWVBD|4.0|Director Ang Lee (\\"Sense And Sensibility,\\" [see my review on that film], \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\") takes on one of Marvel Comics' most loved superheroes, the Incredible Hulk. Based on the enormously popular 60's TV show starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, the film, produced by Stan Lee and Avi Arad, deviates from the cliched, but excellent storyline of the original series. Eric Bana (\\"Troy\\"; see my review) steps into Mr. Bixby/Ferrigno's iconic role...to middling success. His portrayal of Bruce Banner (David in the original) was well done. Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly (\\"The Rocketeer,\\" \\"A Beautiful Mind\\") does even better as Betty Ross (I hope there was no pun intended on the woman who designed the first American flag), Bruce's long-suffering, ex-girlfriend (a slight extension on her character in \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" if you will). I liked HER portrayal THE BEST. If she'd gotten naked, I wouldn't complain (but I guess Universal didn't want to make this into an R-rated picture; our loss). Sam Elliot is equally brilliant as General Ross. Josh Lucas (who's he?) was deliciously venomous as Talbot, a corporate s.o.b who's hell-bent on destroying the Hulk \\"By any means neccessary.\\" Oscar winner Nick Nolte turns in an ambiguous performance as Bruce's father, who's hiding a deadly secret. The famous line \\"Don't make me angry; you wouldn't like me when I'm angry,\\" IS in the film; close your ears and you'll miss it.<br /><br />Had I directed this movie, it probably would've been rated R. The ending left me wanting a bit of closure, but it leaves it open for another movie. PLEASE DO A SEQUEL!! Rated PG for some violence.
B000000WFF|5.0|around the late 90s it seemed that all the girl groups were desolving (i.e. en vogue, TLC) but there was one group that came out of nowhere and rocked the world... the spice girls, one of the guiltiest pleasure of all time...it seemed that everyone liked them, heard of them, or hated to love them... they were unstoppable...   <br /> <br />spice girls were on top of the world in 1998 with SPICEWORLD (the brilliant second album/soundtrack to the movie with the same name)... this is argubally their best effort. it seemed that their voices were stronger and more in-tune on this album.  <br /> <br />argubally the best track on the album is \\"too much\\". the girls harmonies in the song are just...WOW!!! sporty's lead on this song is her best performance ever....the video is a delightful and beautifully done... <br /> <br />another banger on this LP is \\"move over\\" i love this song to death... the old pepsi song expanded to make their point even clearer.... the rock/pop sound is just breathtaking.  <br /> <br />the worst tracks on the album are \\"lady is a vamp\\" and \\"denying\\". they do nothing for me.... but songs like \\"never give up on the good times\\", \\"do it\\", \\"viva forever\\" and \\"stop\\" make up for those errors.... <br /> <br />if you want to listen to good quality music at its best than pick this album up... no disappointments here.... <br /> <br />5 stars out of 5
0061015725|5.0|Stephen Hwang <br />Mr. Cawn <br />Soph Lit and Comp <br />September 1, 2005 <br /> <br />Prey Review <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I thought this book presents a marvelous text. The time spent reading this book was delightful in my aspects. Although it took me a long period of time to read \\"Prey,\\" it made my wonder could this really happen to us. For an accidental experiment to go on a rampage, killing everyone who comes into contact with them. Ignoring to stop the experiment before it gets out of hands to save a company from failure. I learned a lot about how far technology has developed over the years. Although this book is a science fiction novel doesn't mean it can't happen. The setting of this book is in modern day California. Us as readers can relate to this book. This book is not only about technology. This book contains similar situations we have at home and in life. The main character, Jack Foreman, was recently fired and taking over position of house mom. While he is at home his wife is working long hours to support the family. Then Jack is getting ideas that his wife is having an affair. On top of all this his two oldest son and daughter can't seem to stop fighting. Also his youngest baby daughter gets a mysterious infection. The writer, Michael Crichton, gives us a familiar setting to get us into the book. Which is a great strength, but he also adds a little history in to the book. History about the evolution of ape developing into man and man developing technology. If you like to wonder how man became man and how it is possible we are still evolving. The weaknesses of this book id very rare. The only thing I can maybe ask for is more suspense. This type of book is for those who love to read survival novels. This book has their share of surprising twists to change the mood of the audience. This type of text I have never read before. I think this book has a similar style to Hatchet by Gary Paulson. This book is probably on of my favorites, right behind Harry Potter. I hope you enjoy the book the way I did and see the power of technology.  <br />
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is one of the best books I've had to read for school. The story starts out in Pondicherry India with Pi Patel, a 16 year old boy. Pi is not content with just one religion, Pi is praticing three religions all at once. His father is the curator of the zoo in Pondicherry, and when he decides to move to Canada the animals come too. The ship crashes in the Pacific ocean and Pi is stuck in a life boat with an orangutang, a hyena, a zebra, and a huge bengal tiger. On his own he creates a special bond with the tiger and learns how to survive by himself. Pi learns how to fish, clean sea water for drinking, and tame the tiger all by himself. It's just Pi, a tiger, and mother nature out in the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Martel does a marvelous job of portraying a boy who is fighting against the elements to survive. All the characters  The positives of this book are well pretty much about everything. Mr. Martel's characters are very dynamic in the sense that they have many different faces and they are always suprising the reader. There were no negatives I could think of. I heartily enjoyed this story and you should too.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero was the follow up to Nirvana's chart topping Nevermind album, which was met with much enthusiasm and just as much animosity by those who considered themselves too punk for them.  It is a phenomenal album.  This is their best work, bar none. <br /> <br />Every song is a jewel, not one song that was just ok or didn't float our boats.  It's more abrasive than \\"Nevermind\\", it was kind of an angry lashing out at all the mainstream attention they had gotten from the last album and were trying to push people away.  But those who heard it were pulled even closer.  From \\"Serve The Servants\\" to \\"All Apologies\\", every song was just as much a glimpse into Kurt's mind as there was a great musical experience.  The faster songs were rowdy and loud, the slower songs were retrospective and moving.  It made you want to smash, lash and claw your way to a new horizon.  And when you made it to the top, you had joy. <br /> <br />When he died, I put this album in the stereo and cried all night until the sun came up.  I felt a thousand stabbing pains, half his, half mine.  Why?  Why?  Why?  I kept asking myself.  He had so much more to give, so much more music to make, and somehow he couldn't go on.  I miss him.  I miss his presence as well as his music.  He ushered in a new era of DIY singer songwriters, something we seem to have lost in music today.
B000003TBP|5.0|A classic.  The album that put Beck on the map.  Should be in everyones permanent collection.
B0000029GA|4.0|NAS REALLY MADE HE'S MARK FROM THESE ALBUM (ILLMATIC) SONGS LIKE MEMORY LANE AND WORLD IS YOURS REALLY SHINED ALSO ONE LOVE... I ONLY PLAY THOSE THREE BUT I CAN'T SAY THE REST ARE WACK, I WILL RECOGNISE THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE ONLY IF YOU REALLY INTO MID 90S RAP WHICH WAS THE BEST TIME FOR RAP. <br />I DON'T THINK KIDS OF THESE NEW ERA WILL FEEL THIS ALBUM THOUGH.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Tom Hanks is always an excellent actor, here he is younger, but man it is hilarious all the way through the movie!<br /><br />Shelley Long is as HOT as always, LOVE Shelley Long! But her acting is just as good as Mr. Hanks, and them combined in this comedy is about as classic as a good movie can be.<br /><br />A must have must watch!
0061015725|5.0|Prey, by Michael Crichton, is an extremely irresistible thriller that keeps you on your toes the whole time. Prey deals with nanotechnology and goes deeper. A nanostorm gets out of human control and each day it grows with more capabilities. No one knows how this happened or how to stop it. Now, living in the desert, the company tries to figure out the solution but the only way to find it out, is to go outside doors and step into the desert...but no one wants to risk their life. Jack, who used to work at the company, has enough courage to take on the swarms. With his partner Mae, they explore the desert in hopes to discover the answer. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science and technology, likes suspension until the end, and wonders what technology may lead to in the future. One strength I found very striking, was how a family, who was completely torn apart, became closer with this issue at hands. One thing I learned from this story is even if you're the only one who believes in something, fulfill it. This book contains courage, suspense, crime, sandal, death, and much more.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic has always been one of my favorite movies, but I was disappointed with the DVD. I mean, a single DVD edition for the top box office grossing movie of all time, with no special features whatsoever?! I am soooo excited that this movie is finally getting a \\"special\\" edition DVD!
0316172324|3.0|Blink was a bit of a disappointment. After reading other reviews and learning about the author, I expected a book full of great insights and anecdotes. Instead, I found a book of few significant insights and fewer interesting anecdotes. The beginning of the book started strong, but by mid-way, I felt as though the author had already used up his best material, and the remaining pages were simply filler. In places, it began to read like my college textbook from Social Psychology 101. Mr. Gladwell should have waited until he had more to impart, and included the best parts of this book as a chapter or two in his next, more complete work.
B00005JMAH|5.0|A must have for all Harry Potter fans! This has to be the best movie to date! The DVD has a lot of special features and interviews with the cast and director that every fan must see!
B0000025ZF|4.0|First off, I must give kudos to Roger for \\"Rolling over\\" at Live 8, that was very admirable.  Second, this album is great, much like the Final Cut in the sense that all the songs are tied to each other through a central story. I do recommend this album. <br />My only question is WHY does the album cover have to come censored? The picture on the website is not censored! And if it is because of the fact that there is a 'naked' woman on the cover, SO WHAT!! There are worse things on daytime t.v. today, and other things in music which deserver the censors' attention. . .for example cRAP music. . .in my opinion, it should be censored in to extinction.   <br />Oh well. . .I guess I;ll shell over another 20 odd bucks to buy an import. . .or I'll hit up Ebay. . . . .
068983571X|5.0|This is the first work by Arthur Doyle I have read and I must begin by saying it is a brilliant novel.  The mood, the details, the characters--all of it is wonderful.  Doyle has created a magnificent story with his successful character, Sherlock Homes.<br /><br />When starting the book, I found the language odd and not of my liking.  But as I continued, I came to appreciate it.  The novel isn't long, nor is it difficult to understand (though some words were a bit confusing, it is easy to discern their meaning by reading the sentence through again).  Though I liked the beginning, I didn't become fully engrossed until page 50 and on.<br /><br />The story itself, told by Dr. Watson, Holmes friend and assistant, follows the mysterious death (or murder) of Sir Charles Baskerville.  There is a legend surrounding the Baskervilles, and it tells of a devilish hound which has cursed the family.  Suspiciouns of this tale being true are heightened when peasants report of seeing a hound on the moor and unexplained howlings travel on the wind.  Dr. Mortimer, a friend of the deceased Charles, comes to Holmes asking him to help make sense of the mysterious death and advise him on what to do with the heir to Baskerville Hall, Henry Baskerville, who is arriving from Canada.  Many curious characters and surprising twists befall our protagonists.  I will leave the plot discription at that, for I do not want to spoil anything.<br /><br />This book is a classic and is a very enjoyable read.  Well written and engrossing, it will keep you hooked till the end.
0790729407|5.0|This is an excellent, action packed and well-made movie depicting the political/miltary life of IRA leader Michael Collins, played with great skill by Liam Neeson.  It is a very enjoyable and quite accurate depiction of the political and military events surrounding the war for Irish freedom and subsequent civil war.  Unfortunately the viewer has to put up with a sappy love sub-plot involving Julia Roberts butchering the Irish accent.  It also helps to hold an advanced degree in Irish history to fully understand what's going on (i.e., the political conflict between Collins and Eammon De Valera).  Still, if you're interested in Irish history, or just like historical fiction, it's worth the buy.
0061015725|5.0|Prey <br /> <br />Prey is an excellent book to read.  This book contains many characteristics that a book needs.  It is action pact, has some romance, mystery, and even a little bit of comedy.  It starts out as a guy with a working wife and they have 3 children.  The tension starts to build up as one of them gets sick.  The father (Jack) is very loving toward his family.  Bad things start happening one after the other; he finally gets a job offer and then moves over to a desert in a facility where something is terribly wrong.  This fast pace book will be quick, because it is very easy to get hooked on reading it.  This book will be one of the best books you have ever read, and I'd say it is more of an advanced book to read.  It is a great book and the awards bestowed upon it and Crichton proves my statement true.  <br />
B00005JN5X|3.0|Will (Damon) and Jake (Ledger) are the fabled Brothers Grimm.  Although, in this story, they are con-men, travelling the countryside exorcising demons from various villages.  Of course, they are behind the \\"hauntings\\", and when they make things right again, they collect the money and move on.<br /><br />Napoleon's minion in Germany, Delatombe (Pryce), discovers what they are doing, and decides to have some fun with them.  He sends them to a village that appears to be haunted for real to solve their problems.  It seems that the 500-year old mirror queen (Bellucci) is casting a spell upon the area in an attempt to regain some youthful looks.  Now, the Brothers Grimm, with the aid of a local huntswoman (Headey) must save the day.<br /><br />\\"The Brothers Grimm\\" could have been so much better, but a talented director and cast are not enough to lift this movie off the ground.  The effects and look of the film are good, but the film itself is not very engaging, and when you don't care about the heros, you have a serious problem.  Add to the fact that this movie has been sitting around for a few years, and is part of a movie dump by Miramax before new management takes over, and you have a probable box office flop on your hands.  This movie will find an audience with some, but probably not many.  Wait for the DVD.
B000056HE9|5.0|This movie is a great feel good movie, its a shame that this same type of movie isnt made today.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Loved this movie.  Found it to be realistic and very suspenseful.  Acting was excellent.  Special effects were first rate.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Remember those ultra-violent \\"CREEP\\"-type horror comix that used to sit beside Superman, Batman, and Spiderman on variety-store racks in the late 60s?  They apparently evolved (DEvolved?) into the \\"Graphic Novel\\"....a modern pic-book format that is simply a more stylishly presented comic book.  Computer-moviemaking has progressed to the point that these gratuitously violent cartoons can be presented onscreen.  SIN CITY is a hyper-stylized, cartoonish film that blends actors--sometimes in ridiculous pancake makeup (a la DICK TRACY)--with a pseudo-film-noir black-and-white/splash-of-single-color \\"look\\" and improbable, ultra-violent special effects.  Sick stuff, with cannibalism, child molestation and murder, and bloody pound-the-head-to-a-pulp violence forming the basis for short, brainless stories of revenge and glorified depravity.  Even Mickey Rourke's grotesque \\"hero\\", in the longest segment of this disjointed, adolescent mess, is supposed to be laudable for his habit of torturing--in blood-spattering detail--all bad guys who get in his way.  The simple-minded moral basis here is that as long as you wear the white hat, any violence you commit against anyone on the \\"opposite side\\" is justified.  A real Republican, reactionary, fascist-WASP point of view.  This movie is gratuitous, occasionally visually arresting (but the style gets old fast), and loaded with disgusting images worthy of those pimple-faced , maladjusted adolescence male punks who used to lurk around the hall lockers in high-school trading joints and cigarettes while plotting to be late for every class.  Don't waste your time.  Even the scrumptious current pop-tart Jessica Alba is poorly displayed....you don't really get the sense that she's there at all.  Maybe it's all that gloom and artificial shadow.  A crappy burp-echo of classic 40s film-noir.  Don't waste your time or money.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|If you are a guitar player you will like this movie because you get to see Steve Vai jam out!  <br />This movie is a great scifi flick also. <br />I really can't think of any other movies like it. <br />It's one of a kind.
0312319517|5.0|Excellent book.  The author did a great job in developing the charaters and presenting a very entertaining and very informative story.
0887306101|5.0|This book is genuinely very enlightening. It profiles big--and not so big--named traders/investors who make both consistent and large profits from various markets (futures, stocks, currencies, and commodities.)  <br /> <br />Very importantly this book (and the series) demonstrates that money can be made from a wide variety of trading/investing styles: men who are pure fundamentalists that don't even look at charts to pure technicians and many forms in between are interviewed here. The lesson is that money can be made in various ways and that there are no golden rules to profitability, but rather a slew of solid systems with their own unique collection of mechanical and, usually, intuitive rules. The very important subject of investor psychology is a dominent theme throughout the book. <br /> <br />At the end of chapters and the end of the book the author sums up the ideas useful to the reader looking to gain market insight; at the end of the book Schwager (the author) looks for similarities between those interviewed. <br /> <br />Beyond a greater understanding of how to make money in the markets, the realization that one doesn't have to be an extremely intuitively gifted buy-and-hold fundamentalist, or a scalper on an exchange floor, etc to make big money and that failure is often inherent with gaining experience (many of those interviewed completely blew out in their early days.) <br /> <br />This is the first of the Wizards series. If you felt that you got a lot from this book (and you probably will,) then I would recommend also reading \\"The New Market Wizards\\" and \\"Stock Market Wizards\\" (the last is better then \\"The New Market Wizards\\" IMO) as well. It should be mentioned that this series of books is very easy to read and quite fun for its genre. <br /> <br />This book is truly worth the 5 stars. Every market participant should read this. Even if you don't trade but cared enough to look at this book's page and check the reviews then you probably should allow yourself to be inspired and enlightened by this book. Do yourself a favor and buy the book.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|The Greatest Hits of the Greatest Rock band ever, you do the math.  What else is there left to say?  Any fan of the band, rock, or music will love this album.
B000002H97|5.0|And it rocks! Quite frankly the greatest metal album ever created! All 12 songs are awesome, from hard rockin' jams to soft melodic ballads! I never was a fan of metal music until I first heard \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Wherever I may Roam\\" on the radio and then seeing \\"Some Kind of Monster.\\" Metallica proves why they are the best! James Hetfield is THE voice of heavy metal! Lars Ulrich is THE drummer to end all drummers! And there's no one as good as Kirk Hammett and Jason Newsted on lead and bass guitar! Call 'em what you like \\"Alchollica,\\" \\"Sell-Outs,\\" \\"Corporate Whores,\\" Metallica are the greatest bands ever!     I give every song 12/10.
B00006879E|2.0|I don't know what all the hype about Maroon 5 is?  Fortunately I got this album for free, otherwise I would have felt I payed way too much for it.  All I can recommend is don't get this album.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|DT fans should probably just buy it. DT have always been loyal to their fans in how they've maintained their core sound all these years.  I have no problem when they try more commercial things as long as the songs are good.  Their effort on this CD was too U2 for me.  I like it when they stretch out songs with solos and unison lines as long as they have something to say.  Again this album says very little.  The reason you should probably get this is because in true DT fashion they've put so much on here that there's bound to be something you really like.  However, let me say that if the band ever put out a Greatest Hits album nothing from this album would go on it.  Panic Attack is a good tune, but only seems great because it's relative to the other tunes on this CD.  It's hard not to compare previous albums, but certain tracks quote past ones.  Overall, I'm glad I bought it, but I don't listen to it much anymore.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee has one of the most powerful, unique voices out there.  You'll find yourself listening to this album over and over again, craving to hear Amy's voice just one more time.  I could listen to her all day long, she has a major set of pipes.
0895260131|5.0|An excellent, accurate and well-documented presentation of the differences between Islam and Christianity, with particular respect to how each religion goes about seeking converts.  Spencer clearly exposes the hypocrisy of political correctness when it comes to the treatment of both religions.  He also makes it clear that the potential for jihad will always be a threat from Islam until such time that it undergoes a reformation similar to that of Christianity.  It is also good to see the record set straight on the Crusades on both sides.
0375432302|5.0|Love it or Hate it (I loved it), there is no denying this novel changed the American Literature Landscape.  Since its release it has sent me clamoring for Brown's other novels (Look for \\"Angels and Demons\\" as it is the first book in which Robert Langdon appears) and other books of this genre.  While many fans of this book are eagerly awaiting a the May 2006 release of the \\"DaVini Code\\" movie, look for \\"National Treasure\\" to fill your needs in the mean time.  Otherwise if you are looking for a fresh new thriller pick up this novel today!
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|I LOVED the first 30STM album... thought it was one of the best hard rock debuts to come around in ages.  It had depth, uniqueness, slick melodies, and interesting concepts both muciscally and lyrically. <br /> <br />In other words, it has everything that A Beautiful Lie DOES NOT.  Apparently, the guys in the band weren't happy with the lack of airplay their debut received, so they've obviously dumbed their music completely down as to appeal to the Warped Tour kids. <br /> <br />It's a shame that a band with such potential to make meaningful art has decided to churn out cookie cutter dredge such as this.  The only song worth listening to is the title cut (which has a great chorus), but all the other songs seem to blend together and just sound like every other talentless post-punk/emo band like Used, etc. <br /> <br />Jared Leto is far too old (and judging from the first CD, too talented) to be writing this type of paint-by-numbers music. I'm still looking forward to their third album, but as the saying goes, fool me once...
0783229364|5.0|Michael J Fox  gives the preformance you've come to love and expect in \\"The Secret of My Success.\\"  Starting out as a kid in the mail room with an breakable determination, Fox finds the path to success by blazing his own trail.  You will not be dissappointed.
B000AADYYO|5.0|What can I say. Opeth are truly a talented bunch of lads. Nine albums in 10 years, and they havent lost a step. One thing this band has is consistancy. They manage to keep the \\"opeth\\" sound, but give you something completely new, and original. If you write music, you know thats not an easy task. <br /> <br />So on with my review.... <br /> <br />If your familiar with Opeth, then I could sum it up as a return to the \\"still Life\\" sound, but with some new tricks, and a mix of damnation. There are a few mellow tracks on the CD that are far more experemental than any other mellow Opeth song. They have a real porcupine tree influence (even without steve wilson as producer) Overall, this album has a progressive feel, but you can still find the \\"classic Opeth\\" sound in tracks such as; \\"the baying of the hounds\\",and \\"ghost of perditin\\" which are some of the better Opeth songs since atleast 'blackwater park'. If your a fan pick this up! <br /> <br />....New to Opeth, then this Cd isn't a bad place to start. Or, grab \\"still Life\\" whcih is also a great starting point.
0061015725|4.0|what would you do if there were a dangerous swarm of tiny creatures that you had no control or any knowlage of any sort about was in a stage of killing you? in the book Prey written by Michael Crichton this exact thing happens. this book was very interesting to read. it was confusing but the story regardless of the boring information gave me a good adventure. what i got out of the book was not so much a life lesson for say but gave me a vast amount of scientific information. the coolest thing that i read in the book is how IBM used moecular construction to get their of the company. some of the strengths of this book is how out there it is. the authour had a great imagination to think of a plot like this and for everything to unfold the way it did. the weaknesses were the boredom that i encountered trying to understand the science involved. a lot of the science was actually like school; some of it was giving you a lesson about forinstance, molecular structure, or predator/prey affect. i would recommend this book to a perosn who has a wonderful imagination for science that can believe in things out of this world coming true. this book can make you think so hard about science that your head caould explode, but for people that like that, this is the book for you.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This album seems to be one that has to grow on you. Especially considering the different styles from the first one. However there are a few paralells in the songs. The Fantasy is very The Mission-esque A Modern Myth also gives the same kinda feel that Year Zero had as a closer on the first album. Over all it's a great record with stand out tracks: A Beautiful Lie, R-Evolve, Battle Of One, The Fantasy, and even their first single Attack. So before you write this off because it isn't s/t #2 take another listen go see them preform some of it live and then decide.
B000002UC5|5.0|Artist are very sensitive to their environment.  In this, the first of McCartney's solo efforts, he probably felt he had something to prove.  And prove it he did.  IMHO, of all of the post-Beatles albums, only this and \\"All Things Must Pass\\" really reflect the high standards of the formerly Fab Four.  Paul manages to put together a very individualistic piece of work that is, for the most part, quite distinct from the work he did as a Beatle (athough you can hear early versions of a few of the songs on Anthology 3).<br /><br />When the group was together, John and Paul shared songwriting credits and it was always an open question as to how much each individual contributed.  With \\"McCartney\\" Paul showed that he didn't need any help to write a collection of superb songs (some fairly avant-garde).  He also showed his fine musicianship, playing all the instruments himself.  Also, the songs are blessedly free from the silly lyrics that infect much of McCartney's later work - some are free of any lyrics whatsoever.<br /><br />While Paul still managed to create many excellent songs afterwards, unfortunately, as far as albums go, this was the high water mark.  Although this actually was the first LP I ever bought (together with \\"Let It Be\\"), it still sounds fresh many years later.  Now in CD format, it's one of the very few I can play without wanting to first delete out any tracks.<br /><br />While it's a close call, I'd say that \\"Every Night\\" is the best song on this, or any, McCartney album.  For what it's worth, Matthew Sweet does a nice version of it on the tribute album \\"Listen to What the Man Said.\\"
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Finally they got batma begins right from Bruce Wayne to Ra's AL Gul and Alfred. I like how the movie is centred around bruce and how he becomes batman. Alfred did a good job on by telling bruce to don't waste your father's name everyone did a good job on the film. <br /> <br />The best film of the year
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I heard it once before I went to see the movie.  \\"Once you see this one, the others will not exist...\\"  It's true.<br /><br />The best part about any of the first movies to me is the fact that Jack Nicholson played the Joker.  Beyond that, those first movies cannot hold a candle to this film.<br /><br />Dark, cynical, brutal, wicked...  All describe this version of the story.  The way Batman was originally intended.  Christian Bale does an great job of portraying this character.  This movie actually shows us Bruce's transformation and hardcore training he goes through in order to become the superhero we all know and love.<br /><br />I got to see it on IMAX too.  Outstanding!!!
0061015725|4.0|Prey by Micheal Crichton is a really very good book. It may be a long book but it was really fun to read. When you read Prey, it feels like you just can't stop reading until you're finished with the book. Also, When you read Prey, you learn a lot about technology and what bad judgment can lead to. The strengths of the book include: hooking the reader, its very interesting, and very strong words. The weaknesses of the book include: very big intelligent words, a lot of swearing, and its kind of boring in the beginning. Prey is filled with action and is very enjoyable to read if you have the time. Prey may seem really complicated at first with all the big words, but then you understand what's happening in the story after a while. I would recommend this book to readers who are interested in technology and likes to read. If you liked reading Jurassic Park you will also love this one.
B000850IHW|5.0|I have listened to GG since 1972 but never had the opportunity to see them live. Do have all their albums and since the CD versions of their music started to became available have also acqired many a recording. <br />They broke up in 1979 after 9 years of banging their collective head against the reality their music was only appreciated -and purchased- by a small number of  folks in the continental Europe, part of south America, Thailand and Indonesia. In the Dominican Republic where I am from, we got their music from friends in Puerto Rico (Some times the REAL thing but must of the times just a cassette recording of the album) <br />Have been in the US for the last 25 years and have only found a few souls that ever heard of them. <br />If you enjoyed \\"progressive/orchestral/symphonic\\" music and listened to the likes of YES, GENESIS, ELP, KING CRIMSON, OLD JETHRO TULL, ZAPPA, ECHOLYN, PFM etc, you may like GG......... <br />If you are a music teacher, may want to audition some of their songs. I think some songs are excellent teaching material....... <br />If you already have their recordings and have a decent stereo system you will notice significant sonic improvements over the old versions.......... <br /> <br />Either way, you are buying great/best music, well mastered, cheap and you are financially helping a bunch of guys that truly deserve it. <br />Give them a break. <br />Sincerely <br />Harry Cohen <br /> <br />Please note that early releases of one of the CDs (Interview? I believe) was inadvertently released in monofonic not stereo. <br />My copy sonds fine. <br />
6305508550|4.0|This movie is THE movie to watch for anybody who ever gets frustrated at work. At stupid bosses or needless paperwork or silly policies or stupid fax machines that break down all the time.  You don't even have to work in a cubicle to enjoy the humor. You will laugh your head off anyway.  This movie has become a cult classic.  I can't beleive how many people at my job will quote scenes from the movie.   <br /> <br />I first saw \\"Office Space\\" on a pay channel a few years ago and I kept thinking about different parts of the movie long after I had seen it.  Then recently I realized that I needed to buy it and add it to my collection because it is the kind of movie to watch over and over again.   <br /> <br />And if you have a particularly bad day at work, it's fun to put in the DVD and play the ending credits that features a hip-hop version of \\"Take this job and shove it.\\" Then you can dance around the living room and I guarantee your bad work day will fade to just a distant memory.  <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|my only sadness from this hallowed even is that i will have to wait a couple more years for more...I'de have to say ghost reveries reminds me of a meld between blackwater park and damnation with sprinkles of deliverance and a dash of still life.  mike shows off some impressive new vocal ranges.  six stars.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I love this movie and never saw it until last week.Which I feel stupid not seeing it earlier in my life.Scarface is about a cuban that starts a new life in america but notices his life in the new country is just garbage and wants to start a better life for himself.So starts a drug buisness the rest of the movie is to good to ruin so don't read the other reviews and get this now.
0393312836|5.0|I enjoyed reading A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. The whole idea behind the story was very appealing to me. The thought of how at night the world we know can be taken over by criminals, got my interest, since I have not read a story like this before. I also liked how this really made you look at how important free will actually is, in our society. In this book, one gets the idea of how a criminal looks at the world, and how over time people do grow up and change. This book is full of detail and surprise. Anthony Burgess I think really did an amazing job with capturing the mind of a criminal teen. It intrigues me the way Anthony Burgess was able to put humor into this story of good and evil. An example of this would be when the character, Alex is breaking into this old woman's house, and it is full of cats everywhere, and how his main problem with this robbery, is because of all these cats. It really adds to this story to have humor involved. I really liked how the main character `Alex' had a language of his own, which made this witty story even more interesting. The book just throws in a bunch of surprises one would not expect. The only real weakness this story has, is that it was in such complex text, it may be difficult for many to understand. I know for me, I had some troubled at the start of this book because of the language `Alex' created. Over time however, I seemed to adapt to this language, and actually understand it just fine. I recommend this book to those who are capable of reading something in complex text, and would be interested in the frightening ways of how evil sometimes prevails over good.
B000002UB3|5.0|I have been a Beatle fan all my life.  I am a huge fan and even crossed abbey road myself.  Then I started getting into other groups and artists.  Years later I heard this album and it was showing me what I am missing.  <br /> <br />I mean this is an excellent album and if you are a Beatles fan, a must have.  If you are not one, and would like to buy an album to see if you like them, this is also a good one. <br /> <br />\\"Come Together\\" starts the cd off by John Lennon, which is one of my favorites, especially the backround music. Then \\"Something\\" by George Harrison could possibly be his best.  \\"Maxwell's Silver's Hammer\\", \\"Octopus's Garden\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", and a few more makes a great first half. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\" and fittingly enough \\"End\\" make a great second half and complete album. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite albums by the Beatles, and maybe most listened to.  I highly recommend it for someone who likes music from a few decades ago.  They are decently priced and make very good holiday or birthday gifts.
0316286850|4.0|I really do know nothing about makeup, but with this book I am really learning.  The photos are absolutely beautiful, with step by step instruction on how to attempt recreating each look.  I love 'Making Faces' and look forward to purchasing Mr. Aucoin's other books.
B000002UAO|5.0|I'm a lifelong Beatles fan. I love their songs, their lyris, Ringo on the drums and George playing guitar.  McCartney may be my favorite.  So you can trust me when I say that this is my favorite album, period.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Drive My Car\\" which is one of my Top 10 favorite songs all-time.  Lyrics, guitar, everything is so great.<br /><br />\\"Michelle\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood\\" are excellent songs and John Lennon's \\"Nowhere Man\\" which he wrote because he couldn't think of a song at the time.  Who's he kidding?<br /><br />\\"In my Life\\" is probably my favorite song on the album beside \\"Drive My Car\\", and also ranks up with my favorite Beatles songs all-time.<br /><br />Even the lesser known songs such as \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and \\"What Goes On\\" are very good and provide depth to this album.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who likes the Beatles, or music a few decades ago.  It is fairly priced and is a great holiday or birthday gift.  If you are going to buy one Beatles album, get this one for sure.  See for yourself what you are missing.
B000AADYYO|5.0|In only two years since the release of Damnation, Opeth seems to have redefined themselves again. As much as Damnation proved to be a Progressive-Rock influenced, the newest album from the Swede Super Metal band only proves to take experimentation to a new level.    Ghost Reveries seems to tease the listener with a few notes that were felt on Damnation before pelting ears with the trademark growl of the lead vocalist/songwriter Mikael Akerfeldt. The opening song, \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" shows the fans of the heavier sound that Opeth hasn't mellowed out for good and that they still have what it takes to shock and surprise their listeners.    However, just like that last album, they show they are willing to adapt with their music and try new styles and ideas. The addition of Per Wiberg and his expertice of keyboards, pianos and mellotrons adds a perminite change to the Opeth sound. This is very evident if listening carefully to the opening track, but stands out very much so on following tracks. \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\" showcases the new dimension in the opening riff and only shows the new talent added to the band from here on out.    Eastern sounds have even worked their way onto this album, which is evidenced on \\"Atonement\\". You feel as if George Harrison's spirit just walked into the studio when this song was recorded; maybe even a little of John Lennon's too (the drumming is a little reminiscent to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" in opening).    Many times throughout the album you can hear some of Opeth's signature sounds in guitar riffs, bass work and the powerful blast beats layed down by Martin Lopez. But along with this, you can find a more mellow side added in with much thought given to it. The album is for Opeth what Lateralus was to Tool. The simularities are simply uncanning between the two albums. Some of the same guitar work in places, drum beats seem to match and the keyboard work is stellar on both albums.    The weak points to this album are far and few between.One example would be on the song \\"Atonement\\" in which you feel the song has ended, but then three seconds later a new guitar part is added and carries on for another 60 seconds making the song overdone and ruining a terrific oppertunity to lead into the next song perfectly. It just doesn't feel as if it fits. Another weak point would be some transitions where the guys added the duel guitar/keyboard solo that doesn't seem to fit this style of music well.    When sitting down and looking at this album, it is near perfect in every way. Terrific sounds and very insightful ideas outweigh any flaw this album has without a doubt. Like many albums Opeth has released before this one, it is a concept album and a very interesting one at that. Like all the albums released before this one, and surely the ones to follow also, this album will please and surprise all fans and new comers to this wonderfully talented band. Do yourself a favour and pick this up as fast as possible.
B000002UAU|4.0|I have been a lifelong Beatles fan and I have to say that this album is a very good one.  It is one of my favorites.  There are many good songs on it.    Each song is unique from the other ones, but very enjoyable.  It is a very good compilation to satisfy any Beatle craving.  It is a requirement in any good Beatles collection.    Starting off obviously is \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", a classic Beatles song.  \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" by Ringo Starr, \\"Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds\\", and \\"Getting Better\\" follow Sgt Pepper and are high quality songs.    \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\" are both really good songs, in the second half, and are some of my favorite Beatles ones.    As I said if you like the Beatles it's a must have in a collection.  It makes a great gift, and is one of my favorite Beatles cds.
B00003CXCT|5.0|When I got this, I was really excited and I had a reason to be. These movies rule! It had been so long since I had seen the originals; as I watched them again, I wondered why I hadn't watched them more. The first one is still just as good as ever; Mark Hamill did an awesome job as Luke and Harrison Ford was perfect for Han Solo, but the best in this one is by far Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I really enjoyed this one, but The Empire Strikes Back is the best I believe. I think I speak for everyone that Yoda was the best actor and deserved an Oscar, not to mention the best one-liner ever is delivered; \\"I am your father.\\" This is one series any film fan should own and for fans to marvel at; as for Return of the Jedi...death to Ewoks!!!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Deliverance... Opeth's 6th album.  Opeth, the band who never runs out of ideas or ambition.  This album is a big change from their relatively similar previous 3 releases, and a good one.  I will try my best to describe this indescribable album.<br /><br />Well, in case someone who doesn't know Opeth is reading this, I will give the usual and accurate description of the band.  Opeth are a progressive metal bands with elements from a large numbers of other genres.  They manage to keep emotion prevalent in their music while at the same time telling often epic stories and writing long, flowing songs and exhibiting great musicianship.  In other words- if you want great and emotional music and are somewhat acquainted with metal, this is where to look.<br /><br />This is one of Opeth's heavier ones, but it's different in that it doesn't come across as chaotic or violent most of the time.  The heavy parts on this album are more melodic than in that past, less dissonant.  If you're just starting out, I'd say buy Blackwater Park, that one showcases all of the aspects of the band's sound.  This album has some of their most interesting and well-constructed songs, however, and some have started here.<br /><br />This album has a unique, ghostly, otherworldly feel, not like the forest/autumn feel of many of their previous, not like the musical journey of Morningrise, this isn't like any place in particular... This is mostly indescribable, but is definitely on the darker end of spectrum.<br /><br />The songs are-<br /><br />1: Wreath (9/10) One of the reasons why beginners shouldn't start with this album, I find this song to be rather inaccessible.  A lot of great riffs and a beautiful finale section, but not much of their mellow side.<br /><br />2: Deliverance (10/10) Great, GREAT song and great structuring.  The song gets interesting with the jazzy clean section, and then goes into a chorus of sorts.  Various heavy sections ensue with alternating melodic and growling voices.  Eventually winds its way to a haunting folk melody with Akerfeldt's hopeless vocals whispering \\"Deliverance... laughing at me\\".  The ending riff, as many have said is simply brilliant.  It expands and expands and expands.  Probably the most powerful couple minutes of the album.<br /><br />3: A Fair Judgement (10/10) Opeth always has a song with no growling vocals (at least one).  This is a touching and melodic song, seemingly about depression in general.  Great leads, every note in the perfect place.  The chords at the end were an interesting choice.<br /><br />4: For Absent Friends (10/10) A GORGEOUS acoustic piece that conveys what no words can express.  Am I the only one who absolutely loves this instrumental?  Such a relevant and fitting title, very sad, makes you think of the feeling you get at a gathering of friends, thinking of all the ones who for various reasons have departed over the years.  Awesome.<br /><br />5: Master's Apprentices (9.5/10) Dramatic, builds and builds and builds, until an abrupt cut into the most peaceful quiet section on the album.  I must say the transition never fails to give me chills.  \\"Here.. to.. day...\\" The clean part that follows is so wonderfully peaceful.<br /><br />6: By the Pain I See in Others (10/10) Weird, threatening, captures the feel of anticipation, waiting for something to happen.  The circus/mellotron part in the middle is f**king BRILLIANT! It has me singing to myself \\"but we always knew that nothing ever changes...\\" for hours.  For those who don't know, the backwards vocals at the end are one of the verses from Master's Apprentices.  Damn, I wish they'd been something else.<br /><br />People, if you haven't heard Opeth, you owe it to yourself to listen to them.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|If Brad Pitt could be any more of a loser than he already is, then I'd be amazed. You can tell just by his smug and irritated facial gestures that he does not want to be in this movie for nothing more than a chance to spite Jennifer Aniston, make big bucks and say he was in an epic movie. To tell you good people the truth, Troy is not an epic; the only epic thing about it is the multitudes of those without acting ability. And Orlando Bloom...well, I can't go there. <br />     Sure, some will say the battles were good, and sometimes they were. But I have never seen so much battle envy of The Lord of the Rings in my life! So many directors want to top it, but guess what? Stop trying, you daft directors, it cannot be done! What directors have done to epic movies these days is taken the originality of a stunning battle sequence that LOTR awed us with and have made it something no one cares about anymore or thinks is original. Troy is the best example of historical inaccuracy and over-the-top action that I think has been put out. Nice job ruining other's  ambitions! Don't believe me? Remember Kingdom of Heaven?

0446677450|5.0|This book hits home on a gut level. It explains financial concepts in an almost childlike fashion, which works because the author aims to undo backwards concepts that were established early in life for most people. You could call it sort of a practical personal wealth self help book. The book focuses on a conceptual level, without a lot of concrete \\"how to's\\". A perfect jumping off point for more in depth study and brainstorming.  It's turned my whole concept about personal finance upside down.

0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a great book in my point of view. It isn't just a war book; it goes a lot deeper than that. It has a variety of themes and morals, it just matters how you choose to look at it. Yossarian, the main character, is serving with the Air Force near the Mediterranean. As the time progresses, he understands that war is going on and there are enemies out there who want to kill him. His main goal is to stay alive. <br />    <br />     The book shows how Yossarian takes the war personally and tells it to us from his view. The novel contains passion with which later comes hate. For those of you who are into history, the book will tell you the situation in Rome through Yossarian's eyes. In the book, Yossarian is a rebel who is going against the society's beliefs. He manages to avoid death by knowing what a precious thing life is. By the end of the book he succeeds in regaining the control of his life.  <br /> <br />     If you have read or planning to read this book, I suggest to also pick up a novel \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" This book is staged in the future, but the main character undergoes some of the same dilemmas as Yossarian.
B000A2H2TK|5.0|I think most fans will agree that this is not a typical Gentle Giant album. It certainly was more accessible to new comers to the progressive rock stylings, unusual meters and scat styled a capella harmony breaks. Gentle Giant are an acquired taste, but if you enjoyed the meter changes of YES materials, the bazaar meters such as 5/4 like those songs of jazz pianist Dave Brubeck and the raw power of King Crimson, you will probably enjoy Gentle Giant.  If not with first listening perhaps after a few spin-ups!<br /><br />Many rock groups of the era have at least one album that defines the sound of the group and is usually the pinnacle of their success.  Those were the rare occurrences when everything came together and nearly every song is memorable.  If you want to explore another release before making up your mind as to whether or not GG is your cup of tea, you should get Free Hand.  I always felt Free Hand was their definitive album and Missing Piece was a close second.<br /><br />There are several songs which are easy to get in to, for the first time listener.  \\"Two Weeks In Spain\\" kicks off the album in high gear with a melody that will stick with you. One track highlights their unique manner of combining percussive elements or their own voices to develop a beat or syncopation which is the backbone of their unique sound.<br /><br />The bonus live version of \\"For Nobody\\" recorded from a concert in Cleveland in 1977 isn't bad considering the year in which it was recorded. However, the group placed the bonus track right after the original studio track so the differences stand out like a sore thumb but again, it is still enjoyable albeit without the phasing of their vocals near the end of the song as in the studio version.<br /><br />With so many groups being forced by their record companies to produce material that would appeal to a larger audience, GG fell into the same trap of trying to please record company executives and the desires of their devoted fans which unfortunately forced a departure from the style they became famous for on the \\"under ground\\" FM radio stations and college radio stations at the time.  I'd give Missing Piece 4.5 stars but selected the five star rating only because it is a runner-up to what I would rate five stars for their \\"Free Hand\\" album.  When all is said and done, Missing Piece is an album I would call essential to add to your collection to get a varied sampling of Gentle Giant's range of musical talents.<br /><br />A Footnote... \\"Two Weeks In Spain\\" always makes me smile because I was an on-air DJ for the American Forces Radio Service stationed in Rota, Spain when I was first introduced to Gentle Giant and many other obscure groups of the seventies that did not fit into the \\"Top 40\\" genre and therefore did not receive much mainstream air play.s which unfortunately forced a departure from the style they became famous for on the \\"under ground\\" FM radio stations and college radio stations at the time.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I saw the music video of The Hand That Feeds, and I was really suprised by how much I liked the song. Then the other day I heard only on the radio, and the song was absolutely great. So I went out and bought it and it's absolutely amazing. The cd flows so well too. Track by Track: <br /> <br />1. All The Love In The World: A great way to open the cd. It has that perfect sound. It's a little slow, but awesome. Over 5 min long, but great. <br />2. You Know What You Are?: This is one of the hard songs on the cd. Absolutely great. The opening drums in the beginning really kick it off. The yelling is so perfect. <br />3. The Collector: This song is pretty good. I always forget the name of the track, but its semi hard and good beat. <br />4. The Hand That Feeds: The most heard song off of the cd. I absolutely love this song. My dad was even rockin out to this song. <br />5. Love Is Not Enough: This song is a lil slow, but perfectly timed and a great pace. I like it a lot. <br />6. Every Day Is Exactly The Same: This song is really good too. Trent has a good way of portraying his attitude. <br />7. With Teeth: The title of the album. It's a little over 5 min long and it's a lil diff from the rest of the album kinda, but it is one of my favorites off of the cd. In the chorus, he proclaims, \\"With Teeth ahh,\\" as he enunciates the \\"th\\" sound. Great. <br />8. Only: The other most popular song off of the cd. Absolutely great. <br />9. Getting Smaller: I really love this song. It's kinda hard and it's so good. One of the best on the cd. Probably the next radio hit. <br />10. Sunspots: Another great one off of the cd. I know I say I like a lot of the tracks off of the cd, that's because I think it's awesome. Another hit. <br />11. The Line Begins To Blur: This one is of how he says he is changing and how the line is getting blurry. He says he knows he's on the side, but its beginning to blur. Good one. <br />12. Beside You In Time: A little slow one, but perfectly placed and quickens some. The lyrics are amazing. Another a lil over 5 min long. <br />13. Right Where It Belongs: A great way to finish the cd. Hopefully this song represents Trent's style staying how it is. Right where it belongs. <br /> <br />Conclusion: Overall, the cd is completely awesome. If you have heard Only on the radio or even just The Hand That Feeds or if you haven't head either and like your rock alternative, go pick this one up. Highest recomendations.
B000AADYYO|5.0|OK - I've read what everyone said. I am not going to compare any tracks to previous tracks. This is a very well done album. I originally started with Blackwater and worked my way back, eagerly anticipated Deliverance and Damnation (which I think everyone knows were originally going to be combined as a double album) so comparing is almost worthless - almost. If you have experience to go on, you will immediately notice the intricacies that we all remember from Still Life - but this is more mature (not necessarily better!).  <br /> <br />The added boardist gave me mixed feelings at first... but if there is only one thing you can say about this CD, it is that the first two songs are in the top 10 that the band has ever done - not only that, but aside from the fact that the 3rd track (sorry) beginning sounds like some disappointing DIO, even it comes through. The entire album seems like it may fight Still Life for the best thought-out album of theirs.  <br /> <br />You may also hear that the single is repetitive in its main riff - but that is because folks are so used to the crazy changes. It is solid, and like the track \\"Deliverance,\\" takes a few listens to get used to... <br /> <br />These guys are like leather furniture... reliable, comfortable, and high class.  <br /> <br />If you like anything they've done, you probably already own this album. If not, get after it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|great movis, my  2 year old son loved it aswell as myself and my husband
B000A3DFZE|5.0|I've been a Clapton fan for many years. He is one of a handful of artists I buy regularly because I'm interested to \\"see what he's up to now.\\" <br /> <br />I LOVE this CD! While it is similar in some ways to Pilgrim and Reptile, the MAJOR difference between those albums and Back Home is that overall, Back Home is a HAPPY, UPBEAT, SOLID effort, which definitely makes it worth a listen and a purchase. <br /> <br />Artists will never make all of their fans happy all of the time. The only person they really have to make happy is themselves. I think each of Eric's musical styles are represented on this album in one way or another, and he does sound happy and content. I was pleasantly surprised by Back Home. It's a great CD!!
B00001U0E1|5.0|I  consider this one of the BIG THREE of the Shakspearean period <br />films along with Emma and Sense and Sensibility( best of the three). <br />There was some controversy when this film beat Saving Private Ryan  <br />for the best picture Oscar due in some part by the massive PR  <br />blitz by Miramax Pictures.  Gwyneth Paltrow deservedly won the best <br />actress Oscar for her radiant performance. A brief storyline- <br />Shakespeare ( an excellent Joseph Fiennes) is a struggling playwright  trying to deliver a play that will be popular( i.e. <br />make some money for the producer ,Jeffrey Rush). Paltrow is <br />the marriagable daughter of a wealthy nobleman who of  course wants  <br />her to marry the requisite low-life  suitor who is anathema to <br />Paltrow.  Since women are not allowed to be actors in the days' <br />plays, she dresses up as a boy and gets a part in Shakespeare's <br />play.  From there a romance with Master Shakespeare ensues. <br />The screenplay by Tom Stoppard is terrific as well as the <br />supporting players. Cinematography and score are top  drawer. <br />Unless you are a numbskull cretin , you will enjoy this <br />immensely.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I was utterly disappointed by the movie. It was just missing so many things from the book that if you had not read the book you would never know what exactly is going on . I had a huge disappointment from how the patronus charm was depicted in the movie . Instead of a stag \\" a jet of light \\" . How stupid that can be! The lake was supposed to look like a lake ... it was more like a pool in someone's backyard. All the fun was taken out of the movie. I wish Chris directs the rest of the movies too because the first and the second movies were excellent.
0062502182|5.0|I read this book almost two years ago and since then i have bought it as a gift for many of my friends and family. This is a great book full of inspiration, wisdom, and the idea of following your heart... finding your true path in life. I am an atheist and I can honestly say that even though The Alchemist is a bit on the religious side, it is one of my favorite books.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I love this movie!  I first saw about eight years at my cousin's.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays an excellent Emma.  She is elegant and sophisticated.  The role seems to fit her naturally.  Though I must say one of my favorite characters is the talkative, slightly dingy Miss Bates.  She really makes some of the scenes.  Toni Collette does a superb job on Harriet Smith.  A young girl with no known family.  I must also say a word to Knightley the hero of the story.  I have pictures all over my room of this movie.  Have the movie, and have read Emma the book a billion times.  I'm a huge J.A. fan.  This movie is way cool!
B00006SFLV|5.0|My So-Called Life is one of the best shows to grace TV in a long while. A true portrayal of teen agnst, the show centers around Angela Chase, a 15-year-old girl who becomes friends with the wild and unpredictable Rayanne Graff and the sensitive Ricky Vasquez. With her new friends, Angela goes through classic teenage rites of passages that help her to forge her own identity.  My So-Called Life deals with REAL teen issues -- the thoughts from Angela's mind may well have come from any confused, frustrated teen. Not to mention, you get to see the amazingly hot Jordan Catallano in each episode. That's reason enough to get the DVDs. Unfortunately, the DVDs I purchased seem to be copies of the DVD, and the sound is often out-of-sync. Be careful and make sure you're buying the actual DVDs and not just poorly-made copies.
0399152717|5.0|A famous earth scientist goes missing during WW 2. Years later, a cargo ship is sunk by mountain high tidal waves during calm weather, and Orcas, large docile whales attack Kurt, and other boaters during a kayak race for no appearent reason. It is up to Kurt Austin, and his partner Joe Zavala to figure out the connection between these seemingly unrelated events, and find out how to stop them before they destroy all life on earth! <br />  In each succeeding Numa Files novel, Cussler continues to develop the character, and personalities of his two heroes, Kurt Austin, and Joe Zavala, without turning them into carbin copies of his earlier heroes, Dirk, and Al.  <br />  Action packed adventure, with likable fleshed out heroes keeps Cussler at the top of the hill, as UNDISPUTED MASTER OF ADVENTURE, and POLAR SHIFT is one of his best!
0061015725|4.0|Prey was an absolute pleasure to read.  It was the type of book that kept you on the edge of your seat and wondering what will happen next.  The writing was well written, but in the book, there were many technical information used and the text is mostly related to engineering processes.  It complicates the reading if one had to refer back to the beginning of the book every few minutes, but the author does provide explanations of what each piece of information means.  Besides that point, the book was genius.  In the beginning, Jack phrases the issue as just a glitch in the programming which makes it sound like it could've been easily handled and solved.  Later on, he leads you to believe the swarm was something he couldn't understand, which makes it seem hopeless.  From this, the reader believes that it is hopeless.  But, it has a wonderful surprise ending that ties all the loose knots.  This is a wonderful book for people who tend to read thrillers and people who like to believe in the possibilities of science-fiction in the real world.  This book is so convincing because everything they say could, in reality, happen and that makes Prey a wonderful read.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|With the recent Live 8 concerts success, it is a good time to get the original Live Aid DVD for your collection.<br />The DVD's are great fun, especially seeing a younger U2 with Bono and Edges' hair. The lasting success of this great band are obvious when you watch them 20 years ago.<br />Highlights are:<br />Queen - absolutely the show stopper and best performances, bar none. RIP Freddy Mercury<br />The Who - Watch &quot;The Ox&quot; on bass. Quietly standing there playing massive riffs. RIP John Entwhistle.<br />Black Sabbath - One song only :( Forgot that Tony, Geezer and Bill all looked the same back then. Ha. Still going strong today,<br />and Ozzy has been back in Sabbath since 1999.<br />U2 - See above<br />Notable mentions:<br />The Cars - Fun stuff, and again, the hair.<br />The Beach Boys - Good to see Brian Wilson singing with them<br />Ultravox - Midge Ure on &quot;Vienna&quot;. Midge helped with Bob Geldof with Live Aid and with Live 8. Thanks Midge.<br />For you Guitar players:<br />Dire Straits - Mark Knofler on &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;<br />The Destroyers - George Thorogood and Albert Collins on &quot;Madison Blues&quot;<br />U2 - Edge, master of the texture riff.<br />Black Sabbath - Toni Iommi, the original metal riff meister by which all others are compared. Still strong today.<br />Queen - Brian May. 'Nuff said.<br />There is some forgettable stuff on this four disc set, but overall its worth owning.

0061015725|5.0|One of the most amazing books I've read, Prey by Michael Crichton, is brilliantly written and extremely well thought up.  Every moment I spent reading the book, I loved it.  In fact, one day I spent five hours straight (yes, nonstop) reading this very book, it was so suspenseful! <br />The book spans a time period of seven days, a normal workweek, but this exciting journey seems like it could have taken months.  As it begins, Jack (the main character of the story) is an out-of-work married father of three children who is... basically just living life.  Very early in the story, horrible, unexplainable things happen which first spark your interest in the book!  The story goes from one terrifying situation to another, until Jack finds himself in the deserts of Nevada, learning about tiny robots that have gone crazy and are uncontrollable without his help!  Everything that you would never suspect is just what happens, and it is marvelously thought up.  The smallest details lead to the most impacting situations of the book, and one does not realize it until it is too late! <br /> The book is fictional, but based on a very real scientific breakthrough:  Nanotechnology.  It is not only educational, but Prey is one of the most detailed and entertaining books I've read in my short time on this earth.  You read a few pages and then realize, \\"Wow, I didn't know that!\\" without even recognizing it as an educational experience.  The book is filled with suspense, horror, and mystery.  Many questions are left unanswered, until the final pages of the book (which I really enjoyed!).   <br />If I am to suggest this book to anyone specifically (I believe there's something for every kind of reader), I suggest this book for those who are love explanation and details, those who love science, or those who just want to read an exciting and creepily horrific story.  This is a real page-turner, and I can easily say it is my favorite book! <br />
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Sahara would've gotten four stars, except for continuity errors.  Memo to the director, when your characters find a land-yacht in the middle of the desert to go wind surfing to their next destination, that is a major plot point, and you should have had a scene explaining how it got there.  It does not slowdown the movie if it's information you need to know.  You don't just put it in the deleted scenes on the DVD, and explain it that way.    That being said, I believe that Sahara was a good movie with a good cast. I also believe that it could make a good franchise.  However, I believe it must have a different director at the helm, if this series is to become all it can be.    Get someone who knows action movies, and will watch more closely for continuity errors.  If you don't just want to be a James Bond clone.  That does a disservice to Mr.  Cussler, and his character Dirk Pitt.    Watch this movie if you can suspend disbelief, ignore continuity errors, and don't know who Dirk Pitt is.  If those things don't bother you and you just want an action flick.  You will enjoy your popcorn, and soda with this one.

B00003CXAY|5.0|I saw the first Qatsi Movie \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" some years ago on a Canadian Music Station, Much Music, it aired a number of times and most likely due to there being no dialogue, it is all set to music and very inspirational and yet dark and almost foreboding music. Philip Glass is one of the people behind this and well, I thought to check Amazon for this movie Koyaanisqatsi and discovered there were three in all in the Qatsi series, so, I bought them all and will enjoy them all again and again. Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, Naqoyqatsi, Three of the best movies I own... and Amazon had them in stock and sent right away. These movies present more than just entertainment, they really have me thinking about the world differently now.

B0009UC7HA|4.0|Matthew McConaughey, sporting a new moustache and dark hair, plays a treasure hunter who is seeking an iron-clad, Civil-war era ship which he thinks ended up in Africa. (Don't even ask how this could happen!)  He borrows his boss's boat and aided by his faithful sidekick (played perfectly by Steve Zahn) he sets out on his search.  Coincidentally he crosses paths with a beautiful doctor from the World Health Organization (Penelope Cruz) and soon her quest to find the source of a mysterious disease combines with his search for the boat.  This movie is totally predictable, but it is slick and quite entertaining.  If you're not in search of great art, but are looking for an action and adventure-filled evening of entertainment, this just might fit the bill.
B000065AQU|3.0|after my review of this cd i have to say i will never buy another cd from System of a Down again you are better off going with Tool or A Perfect Circle there may be only three tracks on this cd that sounds good buyer beware.....
B0009UC7H0|1.0|After reading just about all of Clive Cussler's books I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read his work.  The movie, although loosely follows the story, leaves out much of the storyline and changes alot of the plot to fit the director and stars ideas.  I would recommend if you have seen the movie don't read the book, if you have read the book don't see the movie
B00004ZAV3|3.0|It has a good selection... It could be a lot better. I did think that they could've switched some sogns around to really make it something. I like the last 15 best... never been to much of a beatles fan...as far as their early days... <br /> <br />ok..so go buy something else...like and Eric Clapton CD...
1582403589|3.0|For the genre of graphic novel, I thought this book was excellent.  The pace of building to a climatic point, Rick vs. Shane, is excellent.  I give it a three because its use of profane language adds nothing to the story. It detracts and serves to limit the book's appeal.
B000AAF276|4.0|Eric Clapton's new CD. For about A month that's all I thought about. And when I first heard the song \\"Revolution\\", I knew this CD wasn't gonna be like his early stuff. It would appear as if the rock out, guitar soloing days are over. But that's ok with me... <br /> <br />In his interviews, he talks about how he's really happy right now with his life. Any fan of his would know that that's all that matters. He's playing how he feels. And it makes me wonder why all these people are complaining about it being to pop and stuff. He's writing about he feels. If u just really don't like this album, maybe you should think... are you really an Eric Clapton fan? <br /> <br />Now with all of this that I have to say... why only give it 4 stars? Because, I don't think it's his best.... But it's up there. There are many enjoyable songs on here. At as much blues as some of his other latest CD's.. but again.. I sure don't mind.
B0007NFL18|5.0|This cd from 50 is amazing it has many artist that help 50 make the song better yayo is init jamie foxx olivia bucks banks the game all of them there all great songs the best songs that i wouls say our on the cd would be <br />5.My Toy Solider<BR>4.Piggy Bank<BR>3.Disco Inferno<BR>2.Candy Shop<BR>1.God Gave Me Style <br />And in September 50 is gonna have a dvd with all the videos for all the songs on this album which will make it even better!!
B00003W7ZM|5.0|I've been listening to Enigma since the beginning, and while I was only 9 when MCMXC A.D. came out, I still connected with it, and have enjoyed every album since. Screen Behind the Mirror however, which came out during my Senior Year of High School, stands above the previous three. Growing up in a family with VERY eclectic music tastes, including Opera and Classical, I have had the privilege of hearing Carmena Burana in its true form. That said, hearing it used in this album is the best I've heard outside of its original form. Cretu uses it to perfect effect in every sample, and no matter what anyone says he did an outstanding job. True there are some lagging moments in the album, but over all it is very well done. \\"Gravity of Love\\" is the best song here, and it is not given the credit its do, especially because of how powerful it is. The fact the drum beats were sampled from Led Zeppelin's \\"When the Levy Breaks\\" only makes me like it more. The blending of it and Carmena Burana, along with the lyrics and their content only drive the song through the roof, and when it comes on, I find myself turning the volume up as loud as it will go without blasting my speakers. It can be said that the album is a little overwhelming, but it only makes it better. The first three albums were like climbing a mountain, rising steadily higher, until here you reach the summit, and the winds of the heavens are blowing all around you. Call it the peaking point, making fans ready for \\"Voyager\\", which brings you down a few thousand feet. I only hope that it is the next journey to something higher and even more explosive. So far, \\"The Screen Behind the Mirror is the peaking point of Enigma's musical career (musically speaking); I hope we see another peaking point in the future to out shine it.
B00000E2WH|5.0|Leave the hooey of the previous review aside. He's obviously got a point to make that has nothing to do with music and is wrong extra-musically as well. If it really matters what Karajan's politics were, read Osborne's excellent biography and learn that Karajan had ongoing difficulties with the Nazis culminating in his being frozen out of most work when he married a woman who was half Jewish.<br /><br />All of that aside, these are magnificent readings. Karajan - as the composer himself recognized - has the idiom of this music down perfectly and finds perfect balance between mysticism and cool objectivity in The Swan of Tuonela, for example. If you want this selection of pieces, you won't find a better played or more sympathetically interpreted recording than this one.
B0000696I1|4.0|I was only 8 years old when this movie came out. I'm twenty years old now and I still remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle craze. It was a PART of me growing up. Remember the craze? You should! There will never be another craze like it! No, not even Pokemon compared to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. All of us kids came together back then. If you didn't have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles backpack or lunchbox you just weren't in. Sorry, pal. I'm telling you right now, I was the coolest kid in school! I had all the action figures (even the vehicles!), the lunchbox, the backpack, the shoes, the pajamas, the games, the movies, boardgames, sunglasses, halloween costumes, etc. Oh, I could go on forever. I had it all. I knew every turtles biography by heart! Hell, I knew every CHARACTER by heart. And my favorite comedian? Michael-frikkin-angelo! <br /> <br />So, when the 3rd movie came out, make no doubt about it! I was the first in line to see the movie! I remember, I was NOT disappointed. I LOVED the idea of them going back in time. But I was only a kid. I'm an adult now and it's STILL my favorite movie of the 3. Why? Because it IS a serious plot! It was like todays Spiderman, Hulk, Punisher, Batman, Resident Evil. It allowed you connect with the Turtles on a more EMOTIONAL level. Come on. Who DIDN'T cry during the Raphael scene when he's alone in the bathroom staring at the wall? I felt for him, man.  <br /> <br />Okay, okay, okay. So, it wasn't up to par with the movie standards of 1993. But they did give it a hell of a run. Actually training the turtles REAL martial arts made the action a little more realistic. A nice change-over if you ask me. You also have to remember that all 3 movies were INDEPENDANT FILMS! Less money to work with.  <br /> <br />I didn't give it 5 stars for one reason... It just seems unfair to Vanilla Ice, man.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|I'm a clapton fan because of his blues/rock background. The songs on this albums aren't even good pop songs. I was totally disappointed when I listened to this album because I listened to it objectively. If you didn't know it was Clapton, this CD would not get any 5 star reviews. The EC fan club might enjoy it, but don't buy this album thinking it'll be anything you'd want to listen to more than once.
0790729369|5.0|Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  One of my all time favorite romance flicks.  The chemestry between Clint Eastwood and Merryl Streep is unforgetable in this classic love story.  A must see.
B00067ZONA|4.0|I bought this collection because something called my attention: more than 50 % of the songs were indicated as \\"Newly Remixed by Nick Davis\\". \\"Newly remixed?\\" I thought...\\"did they do to other songs what they did to 'Carpet Crawlers' in the last collection?\\" I asked myself. Then I remembered that 'Carpet Crawlers' was then RE-RECORDED, not just remixed, so this new collection would possibly retain the spirit of the original songs, making them more polished. So I took the risk.  (The remixed songs are, from the first CD, Illegal Alien and Paperlate; from the second CD, ALL except Behind the lines and Your own special way; and from the third CD, ALL except Supper's Ready).       Overall, I was pleased to hear that most of the original sound was respected, in the sense that you don't hear different rhytms or shortened or extended parts. And my expectations were met about the better sound: in most remixes, you hear a clearer voice (specially in \\"Follow you follow me\\" and \\"Carpet crawlers\\"), and from there you have more clarity in all the instrumentation.       Of course, any remix have the risk of enhancing instruments that were not as sharp in the original mix, and lower some others that were more present before. So there might be a possibility that for those very familiar with the original songs, you will identify something that was not originally clear, while miss something that originally was.       That would be the reason why purists will reject \\"remixes\\". Why change things? Why not to leave the sound alone, as part of the history? A classic old painting might look dark to some, but nobody will ever dare to suggest to release it with enhanced colors and contrasts just to make it \\"look better\\".    And the remixing proccess has another consequence: the sound of the songs is kind of leveled, very alike. But if you are familiar with a group, you know that part of its history is not only the style, but also the recording sound of the time in which the songs were recorded. If you take a song like \\"The musical box\\" from the early 70's, and remix it now, no matter how close to the original sound you stay, there's no doubt that you are \\"modernizing\\" it.       Is that allright for you? If so, you would like this collection. It didn't bother me a lot: in a time in which songs and complete CDs are remixed in five channels for DVD audio, SACD, DVD video and others, I'm more than used to rediscover, through a new mix, the sound of a song or cd that I knew. And I'm disappointed when they sound almost the same.       When you hear the oldest songs, like \\"Musical Box\\", \\"The Knife\\" of \\"Firth of fifth\\", you have to admit that the clarity provided by the new mix really does them a favor. But there are exceptions of course: \\"A trick of the tail\\" and \\"Ripples\\" come from the CD \\"A trick of the tail\\" from 1976. If you take the REMASTERED version of that cd, you have to say that there's nothing wrong with the sound, it couldn't be better. So, why remix those songs for this collection?. The truth is that in these two cases, and \\"Illegal alien\\", the sound is \\"overloaded\\": instead of give clearity to the sound and instruments, everything is in a high level. That \\"overload\\" is more favorable to a song like \\"Los Endos\\" because of its rockish sound.       But as I said, I was overall pleased with this collection of alternate sound songs. At least, they provide something different. If you don't like it, just stick to the originals, or better, the remastered versions. I've got nothing against them, for nostalgia's sake.       I give only 4 stars because of the \\"Illegal-Trick-Ripples\\" flaw, and also beacause songs like \\"Man on the corner\\" \\"Robbery assault and Battery\\", \\"In the cage\\" or \\"Dance with the Moonlit knight\\" are missing.
B000066NW0|4.0|To me, good melodies plus good lyrics are good music. And this album does get a lot. I am not sure if it was Avril herself said that she's a punk but i am sure people started calling her punk the first sec she came out.  <br /> <br />Another thing, i am not trying to make a statement here, i just wanna say that I know what are those people who don't like this album thinking. Actually i got that from my friends, who are obessed with all those undergound hardcore stuff. They all said \\"This kid is damn POP, i hate it\\". Well, I dont know  being hardcore or simply to like hardcore music means that you have to hate music that has god melodies. Just like , u like pop music doesnt mean that you are not allowed to like classical music.  <br /> <br />If people say this album is too pop to listen, or think that it's trashy, then i think it's just the same case as some pop musc listening people saying those wonderful pieces of mozart, Chopin are boring as hell. they don't know how to appreciate different kinda music and most importantly, they are trying to show they are something, which indeed, they are not.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Great movie to see some surf.  There is plenty of action and the ending is breath taking.
B00005JODA|5.0|Scary, tense, and real. The Constant Gardner not only delivers the thrills and the political savvy of the best of them but it's scary to the point of questioning the world around you. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz deliver powerful performances as two people from the opposite side of life who fall in love only to really know each other in the worse possible way. Fiennes is a shy and timid diplomat who falls for an outspoken and dedicated activist who loves to get into trouble. As the old word is said, opposites attract and they fall in love. When she is found murdered in road in Africa, Fiennes begins to suspect that more is going on that people want him to believe, so he goes on a quest to not only discover what has happen to his wife but to find out what is really going on. The things he find out are will not only shock him but shock the viewer as well with a real look into the power structure of a corrupt government that is being dictated to by big business and they lengths it will go to make the all might dollar. Fernando Meirelles delivers the goods with a fast paced and somber look at human evil and the notion of love conquering all and he does it in such a realistic way that does bring you right in the movie and into the characters lives.  <br /> <br />It was a joy to see this film and I will be back to see it again.    <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|\\"So I picked up the new Opeth album the other day and guess what - it's great!  Beneath the Mire is such a great song, and I could just headbang for hours and hours to The Grand Conjuration and Isolation Years is beautiful and Ghost of Perdition is so awesome and... and... and...\\" <br /> <br />That's the type of thing I expected to hear from my friends who, while being avid Opeth lovers, haven't yet found a major way to diss Ghost Reveries.  I honestly expected something lower, something less progressive and farther away from Opeth style from their move to American metalcore label Roadrunner, but I just can't find something wrong with this album.  Okay, it's no Still Life or Blackwater Park, but... wait, it is.  It returns to the uber-progressive feel of both of these albums, takes the high points, and rids itself of the low points - honestly, I'm beginning to prefer the sound and overall feel of Reveries to Blackwater Park, which is my favorite Opeth album, not to mention one of my favorite albums in general.  Yeah, Reveries is just that good. <br /> <br />The album seems to return to the gorgeous clean stylings of 2003's Damnation with the intro of the amazing Ghost of Perdition.  After eight clean picks at an electric guitar, the song explodes (much like the amazing April Ethereal off of Opeth's most brutal album, My Arms, Your Hearse) into an amazing soundscape of Opeth's signature progressive metal style.  You'll notice (perhaps not in this song) the distinct lack of death metal vocals on the album after at least one runthrough: it's almost as if Opeth is trying to ditch them in general, but have no fear, they're still there.  Ghost of Perdition takes influence from a wide variety of places, such as the Gothenburg death metal scene with its catchy yet still heavy riffs, even Tool for a riff; the gorgeous acoustic sections are still there and better then ever, and Mikael's clean voice has never sounded better.  Overall, Ghost of Perdition is one of my new favorite Opeth songs of all time: it ranks up with such masterpieces as Bleak, The Drapery Falls, and Black Rose Immortal. <br /> <br />The Baying of the Hounds begins with a brutal power chord, leading into an incredibly groovy lead electric part in the background, and then the cymbal countoff beings and the band launches into this lead riff.  Thus begins, unfortunately, one of the weaker tracks on the album, in my mind: while still a good song in classic Opeth style, bringing influences from both the progressive Still Life and the brutal My Arms, Your Hearse, there's just something about it that never struck a chord with me (hahaha, I'm so witty).  There's a good acoustic section in the middle of the song, where Mikael once again resorts to voice filters to give a more bleak sound to his already melancholic vocals, and the keyboards of new band member Per shine, not only on this track, but throughout the album: a gorgeous piano segment in Hours of Wealth, a funky groove for the intro of Beneath the Mire, and the Middle Eastern styling of Atonement.  Anyway, despite the acoustic section of The Baying of the Hounds, it doesn't particularly have many redeeming factors. <br /> <br />The next song, though, does.  Beneath the Mire begins with the grooviest drum part Opeth has ever written, and launches into something sufficiently creepy and fitting of the album's general mood to give anyone goosebumps while they're either dancing or headbanging.  This is truly the song where Per shines: the amazing keyboard/guitar intro really does it for me, and for many, I'm sure.  Another good acoustic section is another highlight of this great song, and a slowly fading intro rather reminsicent of Nine Inch Nails leads into the next song. <br /> <br />Atonement brings a sound of optimism to the table of Ghost Reveries: it just sounds happier than the previous (and following) tracks.  Unfortunately, it's another one of the weaker tracks: it's highly experimental, and Opeth was obviously relying on that to keep the attention of the listener, but it's never been an album highlight for me.  I see it as the worst of the three ballads on the album: after Hours of Wealth and Isolation Years.  It's not a bad song by any means, it just pales in comparison to either of those songs, and the rest of the album in general. <br /> <br />Reverie/Harlequin Forest has a very fast buildup to a climax five seconds into the song, and while not the best song on the album, certainly does its job as another heavy song.  It has some wonderful acoustic work and a very catchy, yet brutal, main riff.  It has some of the better acoustic/experimental keyboard interludes on the album, and is very good for quite a while, but the end drags.  A lot.  Two minutes or more of the same riff gets a little excessive. <br /> <br />Hours of Wealth is the second ballad on the album, and has a more depressing feel than the aforementioned Atonement: beginning with a lovely clean electric section, a flute duet is added, and then the song gets really good at the one minute point: a lovely progression of eighth notes on the acoustic guitar with the bass adds a backup harmony and the keyboards create a beautiful feeling of loss, and then the piano comes in: while it's the same melody as on the acoustic guitar, it makes the entire song so very much better.  It goes on the basic path of this hyper-melodic section for about a minute and a half, until at 2:30 we get keyboard and Mikael's desolate vocals, which again, continues for a while, and then flutes and a jazzy guitar solo round out this beautiful piece. <br /> <br />And now, the moment you've all been waiting for: The Grand Conjuration is here.  This song, which was released as a \\"single\\" long before Ghost Reveries arrived, has been the subject of much talk in the metal world: some profess undying love for it, some hate it with a passion.  I honestly am a combination of both, on a smaller scale: the intro is fantastic, a headbanger's paradise: very heavy start/stop riff leading into a progression of awesome power chords, before leading into Mikael's interesting clean vocal style and another heavy start/stop riff over his death vocals.  It has a great guitar solo, several frantic, fast-paced heavy sections, and not many acoustics, making it rather akin to Demon of the Fall on My Arms, Your Hearse (and now I'm going to get lynched for comparing this \\"OMG HORRIBLE\\" song to Opeth's fan-appointed masterpiece).  Anyway, Opeth could have more carefully chosen the lead-off single for this highly anticipated album, but as lead-offs go, this one isn't too bad. <br /> <br />And now, we complete our journey with the heartwrenching final piece, Isolation Years.  Beginning with a beautiful lead clean electric guitar and then having a melodic harmony on the rhythm, it leads into the section with the bass harmony and scintillating cymbals, going into one of the most despairing Opeth ballads to date.  There's a huge buildup to the chorus every time, which is deserving of all of the praise it gets: bleak, beautiful, and fantastic, Per's keyboard work is at its true peak on this song.  It doesn't have the motion of Benighted or the lush, flowing nature of Harvest, but for what it is, it couldn't have been any better. <br /> <br />So that's it.  Ghost Reveries.  One of the most impressive releases so far this year.  Some would argue that I'm wrong, that there's no way it could ever be as good as I say, and maybe it's not quite there, but it's certainly not disappointing.  Contender for Album of the Year?  Definitely.  Best Opeth album?  Maybe, maybe not.  It all depends on your point of view.  It's up to you to decide whether or not you should pick up this album, but take my advice, if you so desire: do it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000000OQF|5.0|G'n R dominated hard rock in the late 80's, and this debut showed that hard rock did not die with Led Zeppelin and the acts from the 60s and 70s.  Axl's anger and angst shine through on this record, and they show the hard life that awaits a group from Indiana who moves to LA to make it big.  Some classic stuff on this CD, and it shows that sometimes the first effort is really the best.
B00082IJ08|4.0|while not as diverse as the first CD Demon Days shows a great range of musical talent. also this album clearly protests the war in Iraq with many of this songs, probably the most obvious of them would be \\"kids with guns\\". after listening to the CD a few times it starts to sound alot like dark side of the moon. great CD and cleaver at times, give it a try, you wont be dissapointed, minus the money they are making off the ipod commercial they made which hurts the band in my perspective.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />What happens when a working class stiff - you know, a decent human being and a live-and-let-live Average Joe type - finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate?  Well, that's exactly what happens to a cab driver named Max in Michael Mann's allegorical thriller \\"Collateral,\\" a sharply-defined morality tale that unfolds on the freeways and surface streets of after-hours Los Angeles.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" is that rare crime drama that is more concerned with theme and character than with the mechanics of the crime - at least until the movie shatters to pieces in its closing reel, that is.  But for starters, writer Stuart Beattie has come up with a humdinger of a premise to get the ball rolling.  Max has been driving a cab for twelve years now, but he still has dreams of owning a fancy limo company one day, then retiring to his own private little island getaway in the South Seas.  One fateful night, he picks up a fare who will end up changing his life forever.  Vincent is a paid assassin who virtually kidnaps Max, forcing him to drive him around town so he can track down and execute his assigned hits.  Max can do little but look on helplessly as he gets pulled further and further into this cat-and-mouse game of cold-blooded murder.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" is, above all, an actor's film, as two intriguing characters square off in a fascinating duel of wills.  As Max, Jamie Foxx beautifully captures the subtle intensity of a man, passive and humanistic by nature, who is forced to participate in what is to him an incomprehensible case of ritualized slaughter.  Tom Cruise, cast against type as an unshaven, salt-and-pepper-haired villain, is chilling as a steely-eyed killer seemingly cut off from even the most basic human emotions of empathy and concern for one's fellow man.  Together, these two fine actors draw us into their epic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, with the latter seemingly holding most of the cards.<br /><br />The movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night - with Mann showing, once again, as he did in \\"Heat,\\" that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does.  Moreover, the moody soundtrack provides a perfect, otherworldly complement to the slightly surreal story unraveling on screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Collateral\\" falls apart long about the last half hour, as the plot mechanics take over and the characters become pawns in the hands of an out-of-control screenwriter who obviously could find no workable way to bring his tale to a satisfying conclusion.  The tension in the first three-quarters of the film derives from our knowledge that Vincent has, for all intents and purposes, caught Max in a snare from which he cannot escape.  Thus, that cab becomes a crucial factor in the human drama taking place within its restrictive confines.  But once Max and Vincent leave the cab and become separated in the closing stretches, we lose that sense of claustrophobic entrapment so essential to the tale, and most of the tension evaporates.  Thus, what starts off as a severely circumscribed tale of two men caught in their own private little hell ultimately devolves into a damsel-in-distress, knight-in-shining-armor action fantasy that undercuts the realism and seriousness of all that came before.<br /><br />Still, taken as a whole, \\"Collateral\\" is a thriller well worth watching.ards. <br /> <br />The movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night - with Mann showing, once again, as he did in \\"Heat,\\" that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does.

B000A7S4B0|4.0|Wow... where to begin? I am a huge fan of the band's first 2 albums (\\"B.R.M.C.\\" and \\"Take Them On, On Your Own\\"). I knew the buzz was that the new album would be different. I've had the new album since it came out about 2 weeks ago, and have been listening to it quite a bit.<br /><br />\\"Howl\\" (14 tracks, 52 min.) is not just an evolution from the previous sound, but as radical a departure that I can ever recall from a single band. The best way to imagine what this album sounds like it is to picture the band sitting on the back-porch somewhere in the deep, deep South about 100 years ago, and strumming along to some songs, all acoustic if course. The influences of gospel, blues and even country are everywhere. That said, if you can accept that a band can make such a musical departure, you can then start to appreciate the album for what it is, and the inevitable conclusion then is that \\"Howl\\" is a terrific album. From the opening sounds of the opener \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\", with a gospel choir filling the air, \\"Holw\\" is a mood piece that begs repeated listening. \\"Ain't No Easy Way\\" (UK single) is a short blast of acoustic jamming, but most songs are pensive (\\"Fault Line\\", \\"Restless Sinner\\", \\"Gospel Song\\" are good examples). This album reminds me in spirit of the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" soundtrack and it's no surprise then that T-Bone Burnett contributed as well to \\"Howl\\".<br /><br />In all, this is a very nice album. If, however, you are looking for more of the sound of the first two BRMC albums, save your money and DON'T buy this. As a separate thought, I am really curious how BRMC is going to take this album on the road. I guess they'll simply have 2 different sets altogether, one for the old stuff, and one for the \\"Howl\\" songs. Maybe they'll change outfits as well. It would be appropriate. \\"Howl\\" is highly recommended!

0743537009|5.0|I have been waiting for this since the first time I finally gathered up the nerve to read The Shining over 20 years ago (as well as being the 1st King book I'd ever read, the original--and WONDERFUL--Kubrick movie trailer made it absolutely clear to me that I didn't want to try it before I was 15--it was the early 80's people Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees were running rampant on the screens and EVERYBODY screamed and hid under their seats when they popped up...don't act like it was just me!! LOL ;-))     And as much as I'd love to take credit for getting this PHENOMINAL story FINALLY in audio form (see my review of the 'Salem's Lot' audio CD), we all know it eventually had to happen :) This is TRULY his greatest story (sorry Steve, but it's 'The One' for me ;-) )I've read it and Misery twice a year EVERY year since, and the fun never dies out on me, although my copies often need to be replaced. LOL They are just amazing displays of TRUE storytelling. (And if you think his talent for spinning out \\"a couple\\" of un-supernatural stories like Misery is just luck, check out \\"Apt Pupil\\" from the Different Seasons collection...if the hairs on the back of your neck don't brush the ceiling you're in a coma--that review coming next ;))    Since the brilliant Sissy Spacek had opted to read Carrie, I was REALLY hoping they would actually try to land JACK (you know the man's name deserves to be capitalized...he's the most amazing actor EVER) to turn this into the ULTIMATE audiobook experience!! A silly dream perhaps, but stranger things have happened :)(Although it would be tough to hear Mr. Nicholson eek out Danny and Wendy's terror...but I know he'd handle his orignal role well, as well as Halloran's..haha)     Campbell Scott's reading was nicely done, and I was very pleased with his vocal depections of the characters and found myself just as absorbed in the story as I always am. The reading might not have been as intense as I expected, but it was a fun go, and I will more than likely warp out my cd's before the end of the year.

6303402348|5.0|FORREST GUMP is one of those magical movies that not only demands your attention during its run of 142 minutes, but it also causes you to ponder it long after the closing credits. Director Robert Zemeckics forces the audience to view world events through the supposed inadequate viewpoint of Forest Gump, played by Tom Hanks in the role of a lifetime. Gump is first introduced in the quietest of ways, a mentally challenged man sitting on a park bench, talking to whoever happens to sit by him. His memories of a life twisted by the evils of the outside world but strengthened by his own iron core of solid values form the basis of the film.  His low key introduction that has since become immortalized in our lexicon--My name is Forrest Gump. My friends call me Forrest Gump--first implies that Gump is a mentally deficient nobody with nothing of value to say.  But as he leads his first listener into his life history, both that listener and then we in the audience quickly realize that Gump's deficiencies are limited to high scores on the SAT.  In all the matters that count, Gump sees with a blinding clarity that seems to be lacking intellectual content mostly because of his hesitant drawling speech rhythms. Gump suffers plenty at the hands of an uncaring society, collectively symbolized by the mean children on the school bus who deny him a place to sit.  Yet even there, Gump learns that there are those who can see his essential goodness: Jenny, whom he learns to love; Bubba, the shrimp king whom Gump dedicates his future shrimp business, and Lt. Dan, a man who lost legs in combat reduce his physical mobility in a manner that parallels Gump's social immobility.    FORREST GUMP allows Hanks to portray a critical period of American history in a series of vignettes that brings to mind Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES, with each tale of both epics ranging from comedy, to pathos, to stark tragedy.  Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan are essentially good people who have blind spots that prevent them from seeing the world as clearly as does Forrest. One of the central ironies of the film is that director Zemeckis wants the audience to believe--at least at first--that it is Forrest Gump who lacks the capacity for clear thought.  The astonishment that I felt at the end was to wonder why it took so long for Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan to even approach the clarity of thought that Forrest so effortlessly achieved.  FORREST GUMP is one of the best pictures of all time and repeated viewings merely confirms that.

This One Love Dub is missing! What a huge mistake, and a big big big big shame!  <br />Only in Europe, cause I do own the US release which does the right tracklisting! So including the One Love dub version! Thank god! Lucky me the US version is different and right! <br /> <br />So be carefull purchasing the European EU version, with the glossy look and feel! <br />Go for the US version with normal mat paper hardcover... which includes both One Love tracks >> Extended & DUB !!!!!! <br /> <br />I have contacted Universal about this problem, and they will give attention to it... but it can be take for year before all these wrong cd's has been out of stock! <br /> <br />I am sad, but the US version I will give definatly 5 stars!

0393317552|4.0|Jarred Diamond did a good job of explaining some of the reasons why certain groups of people on Earth would have a tactical advantage in surviving and prospering over others. Although the assumptions of what is successful have a somewhat modern and Western skew, the book is well researched and includes a number of compelling arguments especially as it relates to environmental factors like agriculture and animal domestication.  <br /> <br />However, this book does not address the larger trends and longer time frames of history such as the Great Year of which Plato spoke. For example, recent archaeological finds make it increasingly clear that about 4000 to 5000 years ago when Mohenjodaro and the Indus Valley were in full bloom, the megaliths of Britain and the great pyramids in Caral, Peru and Giza were newly constructed, the ziggurats, dams and great water systems of Mesopotamia were fully functioning, and the architectural columns of Gobekli, Turkey were already 5000 years old, mankind was at a high state of civilization. Evidence shows countries traded far and wide and mankind had the technological capability to master much of his environment just as we do today. But it would not last. All of the great ancient civilizations, about which Jarred is mostly silent, went by the wayside over the next few thousand years as the Earth approached a worldwide Dark Age that was not overcome until the early renaissance period. <br /> <br />For those interested in a larger, albeit more provocative, picture of history read Lost Star of Myth and Time. This book looks at the macro issues of man on Earth and finds a different set of circumstances is driving the trend of a civilization that was in broad decline for thousands of years before the recent upswing.  Most interesting is the astronomical theory behind Lost Star that posits it is not just the geography of man on Earth that determines his success - it is the Earth's geography in space that also plays a role in human development. Specifically, as the solar system moves through space the Earth is subjected to electromagnetic waves that affect the ionosphere, magnetosphere and indirectly crops and consciousness itself.  <br /> <br />I must admit I am the author of Lost Star and doing some unabashed marketing here. Still, if you enjoy history and liked Guns, Germs and Steel, but want to view it in a larger context, I think you will love Lost Star of Myth and Time. <br /> <br />Viva la Historia! <br />

0316548189|5.0|Even as a frail old man in his eighties Nelson Mandela is still a man who commands awe and respect no matter where he goes. After reading his amazing story I have no doubts as to why. His epic autobiography chronicles his journey from a poor countryside boy from the Xhosa tribe in South Africa through to his emergence as one of the world's great leaders and an inspiration to millions of people worldwide. <br /> <br />Much of this book is taken up by Mandela's 29 year imprisonment, mainly on Robben Island. Here where Mandela and his comrades were cut off rom the outside fight for freedom, they were involved in their own fights for the basic rights of a prisoner. These wranglings with the guards become a microcosm of the political battles that are going on outside, and every small concession they win becomes like a victory for their entire race. <br /> <br />This book is essential for anyone whose race, nation or religion has been oppressed, anyone who has ever longed for freedom, or anyone who believes in the invincibility of the human spirit.
B00006879E|3.0|Right, so i just got this album in the mail god knows how..  I put it in my stereo because i faintly know maroon 5 as a band, sooooooo some songs are alright liek this love and she will be loves, i have to admit the singer does have a fantastic singing voice which is the reason for not giving the cd a 1 or 2 star.   The reason on the other hand for not giving it a 4 or a 5 are the rest of the band. I mean..it has a keyboardist,,, if you werent told that you wouldnt really notice that, but i DO have to say the drumemr is STAND OUT he is above average but nothing legendary.    Onto the guitarist well some slowly blended riffs here and there, the whole album IS  slow paced thats what makes it a bit boring, the lack of excitement, except maybe on some fast hitters liek Shiver,my favorite song.    Anyhow its worth buying if your into pop rock, definatly better than the white stripes. This is an ok/good cd but some songs are too repetitive and too simmilar to others.  best songs for sure    shiver- catchy guitar line great chorus powerful speedy song.  she will be loved- everyone would like this great great great vocals and lyrics.
0395645662|5.0|this book is a good book to read. talks about a different world that is not like any other. Read the book it is good
0689865384|5.0|This book is amazing, can you imagine a society were everyone was perfect and pretty? It sounds incredibly shallow but the people who have lived this way for hundreds of years have been brainwashed to believe that even if the look normal, quirks and all, that they are  the ugliest thing ever. When they turn 16 they undergo major plastic surgery giving them new skin, new nose, new eyes all to fit the &quot;pretty&quot; standard. The main character, Tally, is torn between two friends. She has two secrets to keep but only one has to be broken. Wither she helps the &quot;Specials&quot; find her run-away friend Shay, who has defected and chosen to hide with other 'uglies' refusing to change their appearence. Or she keeps Shay's secret to never tell where Shay's gone, but Tally will never become a pretty or see her best friends Peris again. Either way, someones gonna get hurt and your just going to have to read it to find out what happens next!

B0007GAEGC|2.0|I heard the advertisement for this CD on a local christian radio station.  The few snippets they played caught my interest.  However, once I bought the CD and listened to it twice, I had enough of it.
0345448898|5.0|I first read the golden compass when i was nine.  I  recently re-read it and fineshed the series.  These books are truely amazing with their dark plots and well developed characters, they are now on the top of my list  (i was bawling my eyes out for the last 50 pages in The Amber Spyglass).  I think that everyone should read these books and even though they do \\"attack\\" the christian religion, put that out of your mind and enjoy the world that Philip Pullman has created for you. <br /> <br />a must read and strongly reccomended
1573225517|4.0|Hornby has taken Rob Fleming, a 35 year old record shop owner, and given us a glimpse inside his confused, music-obsessed head.  Told from Rob's point of view, we learn about his obsession with list-making, his musical interests, and his preoccupation with his recently broken romance with Laura (who seems to be his polar opposite).  Rob seems to have built his life around his teenage interests:  music and sex. However, over the course of the novel, we are led by Rob to see his thoughts maturing and his realization that loving what you have instead of what you don't is what makes life bearable.  Rob is often whiny and a bit annoying and he doesn't work too hard at any of the relationships he has, whether with women or with friends.  In fact at times he's downright unlikeable, but the truth of his character keeps the reader interested.  I may have understood Rob's problems, but that didn't mean I always had sympathy for them; Rob's written as a person with faults that make him believable.  At times though, his whininess was a bit too much for me to enjoy which is why I'm only giving 4 stars.  But overall, this is a good novel with lots of interesting characters and an excellent backdrop of music.
B000AADYYO|5.0|If there was an option for 4.5 I would go with that, but since there isn't, I'll round up. The only TRULY 5 star album I have ever heard, in my opinion, is Still Life. Although Morningrise, Blackwater Park, and Ghost Reveries all came dangerously close. This is one fantastic piece of work though. Talk to numerous different people and you will hear almost every song on this album is somebodies favorite. Personally, Reverie/Harlequin Forest is mine, Although quite frankly every song on this album is tremendous in its own right. Atonement I could do without, but hey, its cool for what it is. One thing I love about Opeth in general is the atmosphere they manage to create on each album, and this one is no exception. Opeth is truly the next evolution in metal.
0385491026|1.0|Elaine Risley was bullied by her friends as a child and was scarred forever after. Pile up as much philosophing and moralizing as you want, in the end what you are left with here is more than 400 pages filled with a depressing middle-aged woman's memories of her miserable childhood and bullying friends. Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst.  What twaddle. Dreary, dreary, dreary.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I bought it cause everyone said how good it was... but i was not happy with what I saw, I think its because I was expecting something so funny that when I saw it, it wasn't.  I just didnt laugh like I thought I would.. I actually fell asleep during some of it
B0009S4IHY|4.0|I had heard a certain expectation when I saw this film from reading reviews and hearing about it.  It didn't quite live up to my expectations as I was really expecting a laugh-out-loud film full of hijinx and hilarity.  It didn't turn out to be quite that, but I'm not saying I was disappointed in the film, it just wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.  What it is, though, is a very enjoyable, amusing film that can be outrageously silly at times, and genuinely heartfelt at others, managing each with a refreshing ease.  Also, it is quite a beautiful film, with many of the acrobatics and stunts amazing and surreal.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|I'll begin by saying this film is one of the best I have seen for a long while. The characters are all very believable and draw you in to the action constantly. The acting is superb...especially from Tim Robbins who truly gives a fantastic performance.  <br /> <br />I thoroughly recommend this film..trust me you wont be disappointed!
B000002H2H|5.0|Creeping Death alone is worth the price of this album. That songs is awsome!!! one of Metallicas best songs ever recorded.    Fight Fire With Fire- 9/10  Ride The Lightning- 10/10  For Whom The Bell Tolls- 10/10  Fade To Black- 10/10  Trapped Under Ice- 9/10  Escape- 9/10  Creeping Death- 10+/10  The Call Of Ktulu- 10/10
B000002MP2|5.0|I own every Green Day album (except for ISH, Shenanigans, and more notably, 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours) and the only album that even rivals Dookie is Nimrod. That said, here's a breakdown of my favorite album ever. <br /> <br />1. Burnout- A good opener, gets old after awhile, but the bridge is pretty cool. 7/10 <br />2. Having a Blast- I love this song. I just love the sound of it. I don't know how to put it into words. 9/10 <br />3. Chump- Hasn't everyone felt like Billie Joe does in this song at some point? The main part of the song's OK, but the outro into Longview is one of my favorite parts of the album. (Especially the bassline at the start of the outro.) 8.5/10 <br />4. Longview- One of my 3 favorite GD songs ever (Hitchin' a Ride and When I Come Around are the other 2, in no particular order). I love the bassline, I love the chorus, I love the bridge, I love blasting this song in my car with the bass turned up. I love this song. 10/10 <br />5. Welcome to Paradise- A good remake of the song (the original version is on Kerplunk! if you're interested). I only wish that the bass was as prominent as it was in the Kerplunk! version. I LOVE the bridge in this song. 9/10 <br />6. Pulling Teeth- Sounds like Green Day goes Country/Western. I hate country. This song is passable, but it's one of the weak points of the album. 5.5/10 <br />7. Basket Case- Without this song, GD wouldn't be where they are now. It's just that simple. I do like this song a lot, however, I can't put it in the same league as Longview, When I Come Around, etc. 9.5/10 <br />8. She- It's an OK song, but not my favorite. Billie Joe lets out the coolest scream ever after one of the choruses. 8/10 <br />9. Sassafras Roots- Meh. I never liked this song that much. As the lyrics say, it's pretty much a waste of time. 7/10 <br />10. When I Come Around- This is pretty much the same review I gave Longview. I love everything about this song. 10/10 <br />11. Coming Clean- I don't know many people who like this song, but I do. Probably because it hits home with me, but whatever. 9/10 <br />12. Eminus Sleepus- Mike wrote this song, and it's pretty good. 8.5/10 <br />13. In The End- Not as good as the rest of the album. I do like the bridge, though. 7.5/10 <br />14. F.O.D.- I really like this song. The acoustic part is cool, but when they turn on the electronics, this song really takes off. It's really cool. (It took me forever to figure out that FOD stands for \\"F*ck Off and Die\\", though.) <br />Hidden Track- All By Myself- Performed by Tre at a party (while he was high and/or drunk, I think). A decent novelty piece. Learn to play it in real life and have fun with your friends! (No Score) <br /> <br />So there you have it. Probably my favorite album of all time (and with some of the coolest cover art ever, to boot). Pick this one up!
B000002H6C|5.0|GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE. I DONT SEE WHATS WRONG WITH THE PRODUCTION? THE BEST SONGS ON HERE ARE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY, BLACKENED, ONE, AND DYERS EVE!!! YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM, SELL ALL OF YOUR 50 CENT AND EMINEM CDS AND GO BUY REAL MUSIC LIKE METALLICA!!!!!
0060977493|1.0|This book was full of way too many descriptions and flowery language that I was bored to death and couldn't keep my eyes open. At a total of over 300 pages, it could be decreased to about 50 pages of actual information. I do not recommend this and I have no idea why someone would call this a good book. I am definately questioning the booker prize.
B000002HMH|4.0|A lot of songs on here are awsome, but a lot arent. The best songs on this album are Until it sleeps, Mama said, King Nothing, Bleeding me, Hero of the day and Outlaw torn. Until it sleeps being the best. This is defiantly not there best but its not there worst. Cough(St. Anger)Cough!!!
B000ASDFJU|1.0|Let me start out by saying that my review of this product is completely biased. If I was judging this DVD set solely based on its design, content, and value, I'd have to give it five stars. The elegant suede photo album packaging and the extra bonus DVD are fabulous, and the cost is a real bargain...the entire \\"Sex and the City\\" series for under $200? You can't beat that, especially when you look at the way HBO jacks up the prices on its other TV DVD sets.<br /><br />However, I'm very bitter right now, which is why I'm only giving this item one star. I bought all the original \\"Sex and the City\\" DVDs when they first came out. The plastic packaging of the single-season DVD sets is unbelievably shabby...the covers are extremely flimsy and I have Scotch tape holding several of my DVD sets together. Also, I paid the full price for each DVD set, which averaged out to about $40 a pop. (It looks like the price of the old sets has since been lowered, at least on Amazon's site.) Plus, HBO screwed its fans by releasing the fifth and final season of the show in two parts, so we had to shell out even MORE money. Now they're coming out with this gorgeous collector's set a year later, and it's such a bargain, which makes me very ANGRY! Why the hell did I shell out all that money to begin with? I'll tell you why: because I love \\"Sex and the City\\" and I was willing to put up with the crappy plastic packaging just so I could watch my show whenever I felt like it. There is NO WAY I'm shelling out another $200, even though I want this gift set SO BADLY! ARRGH!<br /><br />I hate HBO.
B000002H33|5.0|Battery is the best song on this album next to Master Of Puppets. The Messiah commands you to buy this album!!!
B000AADYRQ|2.0|Each Death Cab release prior to this one had at least one song where the instruments were different (interesting) and the vocals were quite good.  Transatlantacism had more of these than any other album by the band. <br />This album has none.  The lyrics, my favorite part, are mellow beyond excuse.  Not a single song stands out. <br />The closest thing I can compare this to is the new Coldplay album, where the lead single (Speed of Sound for Coldplay, Soul Meets Body for Death Cab) is the worst on the album. <br />I will give credit for going against the mainstream, even when there is no innovation.  However, this album refuses to do anything to budge out of solid mellow.   <br />Sorry Ben Gibbard, I think your voice is quite good.
0345349571|5.0|This is one of the finest narrative histories I have read. Ms Tuchman wrote neither an apology nor a glorification of the time; rather she let the period speak for itself with a voice that is both informative and entertaining.

006016848X|1.0|I've come in contact with so many people (men and women included) and I will tell you that I have yet to find the belief that men and women are inherently different in relational ways helpful to me or anyone who find new interesting ways to perpetuate these supposed differences. I find it more helpful to employ the belief that people all across the board are different. People are so varied and deep in their experiences and inherent abilities. I have found it much more liberating to think beyond the stars in terms of our differences and sameness.     The good things that I found in the book should be shared among all people, whether or not they have a penis or a vagina or both or none for that matter. As long as we can find one exception to our rules of thumb about men and women, it is more beneficial to the growth of humanity that we seek to honor the individual differences that each person brings to this world and also to respectfully encourage our capacity to improve in the ways we relate to each other. I believe there are principles of higher conduct such as kindness, patience, selflessness, maturity, perseverance, open-mindedness, overall character development, etc. Our challenge as a human race is not to get to the bottom of any relational difference between the sexes. Our challenge, I believe, is to impart with integrity and equity, principles of character development among all people, despite identified sex, nationality, ethnic affiliation, cultural background, etc. I encourage each person to get a subscription to ebscohost (if you can). Contact your local university to learn more about ebscohost. This is a wonderful database where you can access journals that print research-based articles on any subject matter. Here you will find (under the subject matter of men and women) that relationally, when we look beyond mars and venus, there are more differences among the sexes than between the sexes. Upon reviewing the literature, you will find that here on planet earth, in cultures where our ideas of gender differences do not exist, depression among women especially, is significantly less. Review the literature for yourself and see how men and women in other cultures choose to relate to each other. John Gray certainly didn't before writing his book. If anyone proves otherwise, I stand corrected on this one, but I didn't see any bibliography or footnotes and the only 3 (maybe 4) statements that were referenced as support for his entire book were improperly sited.

B00000AFFF|5.0|On paper, this sounds like a bad idea: Two musicians who arguably are has-beens with little current relevance, from vastly disparate backgrounds (punk vs. elevator music) team up to produce the fading punk's songs with the polish of the elevator music legend. <br /> <br />It works.  This record is worth having.  Doesn't matter if you are an Elvis fan, or a Burt Bacharach fan, many of the songs on this album are so good that anybody should like them.  While a couple of the songs don't quite work, more than enough of them do.  \\"This House Is Empty Now\\" hurts to listen to, in the right way.  \\"Such Unlikely Lovers\\" is confession and foretelling.  \\"The Long Division\\" is simply a great, great song, one of the best ever written by Elvis Costello, and made better with the Bacharach treatment.  Elvis' voice has never sounded better.  Maybe angrier, but never better. <br /> <br />I came to this album as a big Elvis Costello fan, prepared to be disappointed by the concept.  I listen to this album almost as much as I listen to Elvis's troika of early classics, and it is his best work from the '90s.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Many bands these days focus mainly on looks and vocals, not putting enough thought into the instruments they have in their reach.  Or else they would have found out how it can be sing as loud as they do.  This album has incredible instrumental use and great vocals that complement each other.  Very powerful album. A must have.
B000000H4V|5.0|Like Socialist Metal Head and Pete, \\"Chaos A.D.\\" was my introduction to Sepultura, and I gotta say, this is a great album to start out with if you're new to the band. I have all of Sepultura's albums (via Max Cavalera era), but \\"Chaos A.D.\\" is arguably the band's best album ever. On this album you've got awesome lyrics of course, angry vocals and tight rhythm guitarwork courtesy of Max Cavalera, mind blowing solos from Andreas Kisser (who also does great with the 12 string acoustics as well), great bass lines from Paulo Jr., and awesome drumming from Igor Cavalera (Max's brother of course). My favorite songs on here are \\"Refuse/Resist\\", \\"Territory\\", \\"Slave New World\\", \\"Biotech is Godzilla\\", \\"Propoganda\\", and \\"Kaiowas\\" (which was inspired by the Brasilian tribe that committed mass suicide as a protest against the government). The other songs are great, but the ones I mentioned are my favorites. Please read on for my track ratings.<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings<br /><br />1. Refuse/Resist - Killer album opener. 5/5<br /><br />2. Territory - Love this song. 5/5<br /><br />3. Slave New World - 5/5<br /><br />4. Amen - 5/5<br /><br />5. Kaiowas - Love the acoustics, great tribal beats as well. 5/5<br /><br />6. Propoganda - 5/5<br /><br />7. Biotech is Godzilla - Short, but very fast and fun to headbang to. 5/5<br /><br />8. Nomad - 5/5<br /><br />9. We Who Not As Others - 4/5<br /><br />10. Manifest - 5/5<br /><br />11. The Hunt - 5/5<br /><br />12. Clenched Fist - 5/5<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br /><br />13. Chaos B.C. - Nice remix of Refuse/Resist, but the original version is much better. 4/5<br /><br />14. Kaiowas (Tribal Jam) - 5/5<br /><br />15. Territory (Live) - 5/5<br /><br />16. Amen/Inner Self (Live) - 5/5<br /><br />BTW: I agree with Socialist Metal Head and Pete that Derek Green can't even match up with Max. So anyways just stick with Sepultura's first six albums. Get this album now, if you love metal.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|With their last album, \\"Steal This Album,\\" I thought they might have started losing their edge.  It was good but it could have been way better. <br />But when they came out with their single, \\"Cigaro,\\" this long wait was worth it.  \\"Mesmerize\\" is what they are, insanely artistic, compelling, and full of surprises.  From the start to the end,  it is in not one bit less than incredible.  It grabs you and almost forces itself down your throat.
B0000584V3|5.0|This was the first Opeth album I bought, and I gotta say whenever I listen to this, it just brings tears to my eyes because it's just beautifully amazing. Blackwater Park definately has it all: Wonderfully written lyrics, great guitar riffs from Peter Lindgren, great bass lines from Martin Mendez, great drumming from Martin Lopez, and of course towering over all that are the excellent vocals and amazing guitarwork courtesy of the one and only Mikael Akerfeldt. Please read on for my song ratings.<br /><br />1. The Leper Affinity - Great way to start off this album. The guitar riffs, the drums, and Mikael's vocals will make your jaw drop in pure delight. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />2. Bleak - Awesome song. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />3. Harvest - Rating: 5/5<br /><br />4. The Drapery Falls - My favorite song on here, and my favorite Opeth song ever. Words just can't describe how incredible this song is. No doubt about it, this song should be considered legendary. Rating: 10/5<br /><br />5. Dirge For November - Great song. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />6. Funeral Portrait - Mikael's vocals really shine on here. Love the solos BTW. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />7. Patterns in the Sky (Instrumental) - Rating: 4/5<br /><br />8. Blackwater Park - The title track, even more brilliance. A great way to end this masterpiece. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />Well, there you go. This album is an absolute must have for TRUE metalheads like myself. Get it now. BTW, also get the band's new album Ghost Reveries as well.<br /><br />LONG LIVE OPETH!!
B000094A6B|4.0|The basic idea of this film -- a couple of thirty-somethings start their own fraternity house -- sounds awful, but it actually works. The first half of this film had me doubled over laughing. By that time the plot was so convoluted that the second half was taken up with unraveling it, and dragged a bit. Still, a great film for popping a few brews, sitting back, and enjoying life.
0151003084|5.0|Yes, it's warped! I feel like such an utter sociopathic evil human being for thinking this sick creation is completely hysterical. Oh, gosh, I mean, what's wrong with me that I break out laughing over what sounds in description the most demented thing ever drawn?<br /><br />For those who may not know, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, by the legendary Edward Gorey, is a series of pen and ink illustrations that concern the ghastly, serial deaths of twenty-six small children (yes I feel awful just typing that knowing it's being read) all of whom have a name beginning with one consecutive letter of the alphabet, A,B, C, etc. and all of whom are depicted meeting singularly gruesome fates, each of the incidents set merrily to rhyme.  The children are Victorian or Edwardian, as are nearly all characters Gorey drew, and they meet their demises in astonishingly horrid ways. One is devoured by mice, another is eaten by bears. Another is sucked dry by a leech, yet another unfortunate meets her fate under a rug. One child even manages to perish from ennui!<br /><br />Oh, dear Lord, this is insanity, and yet as penned by Gorey, this is so sick it's funny.<br /><br />I'm stopping here.<br /><br />Before anyone tracks me down to stone me at a crossroads under a full moon while chanting from the Book of Common Prayer, try reading this disgustingly hilarious little collection and see if you don't agree it reaches in and finds some twisted avenue in your soul and tickles till your inner sadist erupts with laughter.<br /><br />I like children. I swear I do.<br /><br />\\"M is for Maud who was swept out to sea...\\"<br /><br />Help! I'm not a bad person for laughing, honestly! Sick! Sick! SICK!
