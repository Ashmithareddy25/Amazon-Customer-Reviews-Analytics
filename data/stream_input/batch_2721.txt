B004MC8CA2|5.0|The bible App is the best thing that ever happen to a believer in Jesus Christ. You just have to download it and you can read your bible anywhere anytime.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Perfect as expected.
B005QMOZOO|2.0|Excited to read a 'continuing' instalment of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair, I was pleasantly surprised to hear Austen's voice in the introductory pages; however, my initial impression was soon derailed . . . so what went wrong?<br />1. Repetitive - why was the same tale told ten times over? Surely there would be a twist, but alas, no.<br />2. Predictable - I guessed much of the 'mystery' quite early.<br />3. Characterisation - this wasn't my Elizabeth or my Darcy I had connected with in 'Pride and Prejudice'.<br />Disappointing!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Don Drapper is THE best (John Hamm) great cast, fun to watch them grow and evolve!  If you lived through that time it's interesting to watch!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is a must see. The story is great and so is the cast.  It has its funny parts too.  You won't be disappointed.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is great. The only problem is in the shop. It is far too easy to buy things on accident while you are just trying to look at the stats of the items.
B00B9ZCVN4|2.0|The viewpoint character is extremely passive. This works okay for the initial setup, because that is all about showing us the world and setting the stage. I was actually enjoying the book for the first few chapters, it wasn't my favorite thing by Mr. Reynolds, but I was feeling I had got my money's worth and wasn't wasting my time.<br /><br />And then chapter 7 happened. I don't want to spoil the book with too many specifics, but at that point the passiveness of the main character became a real problem. The main character is manipulated into working on a mystery, but he isn't at all interested in solving it. So a peripheral character does something absurdly stupid, and the main character enthusiastically goes along... And so the story moves forward again. Page after page of passive people following the lead of a crazed idiot. And then more peripheral characters enter and offer various means of salvation or selling out.<br /><br />I probably should wait until I've finished it to review the book, but I don't think I can bring myself to finish it at this point - I feel insulted and annoyed.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Kick ass was kick ass! Good gun blasting action. Real fast shipping, can't wait for pt 2. This is a good buy if u like funny or Action movies
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more levels! Oh yeah!!! Mind stimulating fun. It is a great time passerby. Would recommend to patient people.
B005COO1X6|3.0|It was okay for a short story.The end far fetched. But that is Stephen King for you.  I still like his books in general.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I sometimes don't hear it ring unless it s kept on the application the entire night which drains the battery even with the power saver...
B00000J2PH|3.0|Pleasant sound. She sounds folky and 70's at the sametime. Cd is on sale and  was interesting to listen to a few of her songs that I wasnt familiar w.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I love British movies and their wonderful actors.<br />Dustin Hoffman did a great job bringing these treasures together for a humorous movie.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I told my niece ya gotta watch this movie ...everyone's a suspect! I dont think she wanted to because its dated and not fast paced but we were cracking up. Every character had an opportunity to be the bad guy according to the two guys trying to solve the case. She didnt expect the ending which was even better!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book provides just what I wanted: the history, plus cultural, political, religious, etc., background of the first century in the Middle East . . .
B000028U0Y|5.0|Cd on sale but this man a frickin LEGEND! Got a cool voice and ability to relate to his audience. I know people who arent country music fans but a majority seem to have a tolerance for Johnny Cash. Happy w purchase! :)
B0093QIEZA|5.0|I love this movie and the story and actors are great.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes SCI-FI.
B001F0VHEM|3.0|Not a huge Pink fan but I purchased this cd for two reasons: it was on sale and I wanted to listen to songs that havent recieved much air play. There was a 50/50 chance Id walk away a Pink fan or just continue to be mildly entertained. The girl seems to have a lot of spunk and it shows in her music. Thats all I'm going to say.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This season did not fail to meet expectations. Great show, interesting turn of events. Can't wait for Season 3 to come out!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Was little iffy about the new 52 series. But it has yet to disappoint me and this Barman was hard to put down. 2 thumbs up
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins wrote a fantastic work in her Hunger Games series.  While the book started out targeted to a young adult audience, the dystopian aspects will appal to the adult reader as well. The series is particularly good for reluctant readers since the readability and pacing encourages the reader to continue with the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is Omg amazing! This game is the best game ever! This is not like any other game in the app store . And not any other game I have played!
B0064W65UM|5.0|The inclusion of graphic novels into the digital world is a great idea. I had the print edition and opted to read the digital edition instead because of readability. I would definitely recommend this edition to anyone.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great film, I can not wait for the next tow to come out! Done just as well as the  Lord of the Rings trilogy. A must see if you are a movie buff of this type of action/adventure films!
B00D56GJCE|5.0|I'm not one to gush about television shows, but Orphan Black is a much watch! Witty, heartfelt, well-acted,& sexy are just a few of the words I can use to describe it. If you haven't had a chance to watch it yet, please do!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I am a fan of Groban, and found this CD to my liking as well as all the other CD's.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Heard one song from this album and my son is a fan so I decided to try it. What a great album this is. A little different from previous Iron and Wine but well worth the listen. I pretty much like the whole entire album. So does my son!
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|I enjoyed the film and the great actors. I did have to watch it twice because I found it hard to understand with all the flash backs and forwards.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love playing the game because it is challenging for me. When I play with someone else I always win. I don't see anything that needs improving, I like it the way I is.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|A great film with a different version of the Hansel & Gretel I grew up with. The action/thriller is a must for film buffs of this story line.
B005544TRQ|5.0|After hearing my brother tell me several times to watch this show, I finally caved and watched with my amazon prime trial. Needless to say I watched the first 2 seasons in a matter of days. A witty and well written show.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I have enjoyed all of these Die Hard films for the action/thrillers they provide. You just get to sit back and enjoy and don't need to think about anything.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I love fantasy and adventure and this has them both!  I thought it was very well done and fun to watch (for little kids some scary). It had everything I would like to find in a good book with a feel good ending. Bravo!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Well THAT was a surprise! An animated feature for fun-loving, movie-loving adults. How do I know?<br /><br />  * The dialogue: Our hero talks like George Clooney talking like Clark Gable in \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" so pay close attention!<br />  * Homages to classics from \\"Star Wars\\" to \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\"<br />  * The music has everything from yodeling during a chase scene (with toilet paper trailing from a shoe) to Ride of the Valkyries during an aerial attack.<br />  * The Spirit of the West (in an Alabaster Chariot) is a serape-clad Clint Eastwood in a white golf cart with a bunch of Oscars tossed in the back.<br />  * The line dance of the townspeople on Main Street is done to Cool Water by what sounds like the Sons of the Pioneers.<br />  * A Greek Chorus/Mariachi Band which explains the action, consists of four little cactus owls.<br />  * The hawk that terrorizes the town has a partial silver beak, a la Lee Marvin in Cat Ballou.<br />  * One of the townspeople has a crackly voice like Pat Buttram from the old Roy Rogers movies.<br />  * The snake is waaaay too scary for children even though it is clearly patterned after the one from the \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise.<br />  * Much of Hans Zimmer's music seems inspired by Ennio Morricone of Spaghetti Western fame.<br /><br />The voice work is exemplary:<br />  * Johnny Depp (\\"The Tourist\\") is our hero, a scrawny little chameleon. He articulates, he projects, he emotes! This little lizard is an out-of-work actor with delusions of adequacy who is accidentally dumped along the Interstate near a town in the throes of a drought.<br />  * Isla Fisher (\\"The Lookout\\") is the spunky little gecko who is trying to save her daddy's ranch.<br />  * Abigail Breslin (\\"Zombieland\\") is the sweet little possum who believes in our hero.<br />  * Ned Beatty (\\"Toy Story 3\\") is the land tortoise who is mayor of that little burg.<br />  * Timothy Olyphant (\\"Deadwood\\") does a bang-up job voicing Clint Eastwood.<br />  * Bill Nighy(\\"Valkyrie\\") is that evil rattlesnake.<br /><br />The list of voices goes on and on, with each and every one of them inspired by a great goofy script from John Logan (\\"Gladiator\\") and direction by Gore Verbinski (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" franchise). The animation is excellent, while everything from the music to the dialogue feels young, energetic and very funny! My DVD from Amazon is a favorite.<br /><br />You'll like it a lot if you like movies. I laughed more than most of the audience because I'm afraid many of the older references went over their heads. I hope you give this classic Western a shot...smile...
B0035S996U|5.0|Turned my 15 year old onto this and now she's watched it a few times. A memory has been made together, COOL BEANS!!!
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Our little orphaned Puss, in order to help his adopted mother, sets off on a quest to find the goose that laid the golden egg. Actually he's after some magic beans... Or... Oh rats! It's too complicated to go into here, but suffice it to say, our favorite gato hits a few snags along the way. Replay your DVD from Amazon if you want to figure it out.<br /><br />Of course, we have a lot of amigos to help:<br />  * Antonio Banderas (&quot;Haywire&quot;) is our eponymous orange tabby, resourceful, macho and (trying to be) trustworthy.<br />  * Salma Hayek (&quot;Grown Ups&quot;) is Kitty Softpaws (she's been de-clawed), a tough but oh so gentle, little gray and white pussycat. She's also a bit of a flirt.<br />  * Zach Galifianakis (&quot;Due Date&quot;) is Humpty Dumpty; with friends like this, who needs... Oh, you know... (...but I liked that ingenuous little sprinkle of freckles...)<br />  * Billy Bob Thornton (&quot;Faster&quot;) is Jack (of Jack and Jill notoriety). This dastardly duo blasts around the frontier in a wagon pulled by a team of javalinas.<br />  * Amy Sedaris (lots of TV) is Jill, Jack's better (?!) half. They are after the goose that laid the golden egg (see above).<br /><br />I loved the Latino-flavored soundtrack, the flamenco dances, the swashbuckling sword fights, the dash across open country from a cat's-eye level, and, above all, being amazed by the subtle nuances displayed on each character's face. Today's animators are brilliant, they know how to capture emotion, speech, and movement, all true to each personality.<br /><br />Children will get a big kick out of the story and the action, while adults will appreciate the artistry and the humor. ¡El gato con botas es gran diversión!
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Wouldn't have minded a few seasons of this ... Especially to see River flesh out some more and take on a few bad guys, solve some riddles and such
0425263924|5.0|Sylvia Day is an exceptional writer! Her story line captivated me to keep reading the book. I have shared this book with friends and I can't wait to read the next one!

B000FBJAEG|4.0|My enthusiasm and interest were awaken from the beginning. It is very well written and the unfolding of activities that brought both main characters together was nicely plotted. This was the birth of a great partnership between King and  Maxwell.  I've started viewing the television series and my husband and I like it a lot.
B000QR4WO2|5.0|I stumbled onto Nightwish by chance with their single Walking in the Air.  This led directly to their 2006 concert album End of an Era.  Playing in front of an adoring home audience, Nightwish rises to the occasion.  The concert is high intensity head banging music at its best.  The album from start to finish is worth the price.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!because it is fun plus it help me do hair so I can do my daughter's hair when I grow up and I want to have my own beauty salon.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love Benedict and love the Sherlock Holmes series. Each show is fascinating and Sherlock and Dr. Watson's relationship to each other is always interesting to see play out. I hope a new series is going to come out soon. As  Benedict gets busier with other movies I worry he won't have time for more Sherlock Holmes shows.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a super fun game if you're a fan of hidden object games!  I highly recommend it to others you'll enjoy it lots!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. The puzzles are challenging. The storyline is intriguing. The detail of the graphics is amazing. I can't wait till the next one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game that everoney can enjoy, hope to see more games like this in the future. yeah!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is amazingly real. I love playing the game because is fun and doesn't get boring. Also u can get multiple horses and earning gems and coins<br />is r-e-a-l-l-y easy. Over all i think it gets a rating of 3 stars. Enjoy! :D
B008J05EL8|1.0|Just bought this following my kindle directions and now I can't even open this. I would like to have my money back to buy something that works.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I play magic with friends frequently, but as we have aged and had children the Times we can get together and play have gotten limited this is a fun way to get a little bit of the fun back on my own.
B007D15NE2|5.0|Coraline finds the tunnel to the other world where Neil Gaiman has created an eerie and surreal duplicate of home. The story is intense and sinister, but you're certain it is all going to be alright as long as the cat keeps showing up. The best part of this book was the cat. I'm sure every one says that, but that cat was super cool. He had all the cat's characteristics of aloof superiority and willful disinterest, and yet he was a solid friend with a sharp tongue. When Coraline suggests, \\"We could be friends, you know.\\" The cat replies, \\"\\"We COULD be rare specimens of an exotic breed of African dancing elephants. But we're not. At least,\\" it added cattily, after darting a brief look at Coraline, \\"I'M not.\\" The only problem with Coraline was it was over too soon. The darkness and creepiness had become my dreamlike world and I was not yet ready to leave it.
1451673442|5.0|Magical book with real tips to live a better life and enjoy what life offers<br />This book will change your way of living
B00AVQKNBE|5.0|I saw this movie once and fell in love with it.  Now that I have a Kindle Fire, I decided to buy it because I want to view this movie periodically and it was better to buy it and have it available when the mood strikes than to keep on renting it.  This movie covers a historical period, but, more importantly, it speaks to gender and the continuum that exists in the human race.
1451624468|5.0|I'm happy with how brainy this book is. I didn't want a dumbed-down version of what Krauss had to say and this book delivers. I was familiar with Krauss' work already but I had more detailed questions and this book delivers. I can't wait to get to Dawkins' afterward.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I purchased this ablum as a gift for my wife.  I had purchased Mar's other album Unorthadox Jukebox and she really liked that so I got this one too and turned out that it is just as good as.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book series ever I couldn't stop reading it. Team peeta!<br /><br />Katniss was awsome and finally faced her fear poor prim i hope they show katniss kids in movie
B00AHXIC50|5.0|and she loves!  In fact she's been playing the album none stop since I purchased it for her.  To be honest the songs are catchy and have grown on me.  Mars has a very easy to listen musical style and decent lyrics.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|beside driving me crazy at lease nce a day, i lved the chalenges and played eveery chance i got....i would recomend it to anyone who would like to be erntertained every minute lthey were playing itl.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This follows the history of cancer dating back to ancient times and its treatments from then until today. It's a very interesting read written from a medical perspective.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series. something for everyone. unexpected twists, multiple story lines. excellent British TV. I recommend for everyone. All ages will like
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like that I can use this app to listen to music.  I was able to hear all the music I ordered from amazon.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A truly fascinating story. I could not put it down. It being a true story just made it even better.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|The music makes this film. It grabs you, and doesn't let you go, even through the credits. This is not a fluffy chick-flick. It will make you look at 'Romeo and Juliet' in a whole new way. The gowns are stunning. Uh, if I could afford them, I would dress like that every day! I dare you not to laugh, cry, gasp, or hate that little traitorous boy. I like how the audience is made to understand the restrictions of that period, on both men and women, and with everything at the Queen's favor. Casting was perfect. Even if you don't like 'period' films, I think you will like this one. It starts out almost like a play itself, and then develops into a gripping film.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I've been playing this game since March and find it very enjoyable & addictive. One bummer is that when I had to switch devices I had to start all over. Wish there had been a way to transfer the game's data to my new Kindle. The other thing is that on my new Kindle w/8.9\\" screen the rooms are a bit larger but the icons for quests,gifts,collections,etc. are much smaller and harder to access. Liked it much better on my 7\\" screen.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This is a good, solid detective movie, with a romance element, and highlights of flaws in the justice system. There is win and lose here. Who lost depends on what side you're on. The Lincoln Lawyer chooses his side. Almost a car salesman type lawyer is caught in a moral dilemma, and uses his knowledge of the justice system to solve it. Well done.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|A wake up call for anyone who thinks they can't overcome obstacles. If Nikki can over come what he's encountered, including death, we owe it to ourselves to try too. Whether it's an addiction or just self destructive behavior, get the F*** over it and move on into a positive, happy, healthy place. Thank you Nikki! You made me realize what a pansy I'm being about a couple of things. Now...off to figure out how to forgive the one person I've never forgiven and to make my own path more pure. &#60;3
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|An action-packed film, with beloved superheroes fighting as one. The superheroes' modesty creates an ego that they must overcome, in order to work together, and save the planet. An unexpected death shocks them into reality and focus. Just a great movie that I never get tired of watching.
0671449028|5.0|In our household, this charming, silly sing-song lilting rhyme-fest became a staple of the nighttime routine every bit as necessary as Goodnight Moon. Very young children get the humor intended and have the benefit of hearing what amounts to early phonics training as well as having Sandra Boynton's charming animals model a sensible bedtime routine for them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing fun for me as well as my six year old son! very addictive with a lot of different scenes! very happy!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The saga continues in parallel with the last book. Martin reminds you what was going on in the other lands without repeating half the story. Death does not seem permanent. Tyrion dies  but does he? Is he a mummer jousting on the dog or sell sword? Who will be the 3 heads of the dragons?
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Script was good acting good only con was this copy keptpausing an them jumping a few minutes. Made it hard to watch

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great purchase! I love the game it's great! The horses are very realistic and goals are intense! Get it
B002WV5A9G|5.0|We go back a ways to see the end of George Kirk's career and the birth of his son James. The story moves us through James entering the academy and the beginning of his relations with the rest of the crew. Things get moving quickly with the introduction of a time traveling ship that attacks the Vulcan planet. The newly christened Enterprise if put into battle immediately where it all begins, setting the ground work for the future of the Enterprise crew. This movie is loaded with a great cast, plenty of who's who in today's Hollywood and good balance of talent. Add the cinematic style of JJ Abrams and Dan Mindel and you get a work of art. It's shot on 35mm and turns out an anamorphic format with lots of hidden lens flares, it's like old school meets hi-def, very apparent in a lot of the scenes on the bridge of the Enterprise.<br />I highly recommend this movie for fans and non-fans of Star Trek, it's entertaining whether you've seen Star Trek or not. Fans can argue some flaws in the timeline or event's, regardless of right or wrong it doesn't detract from how good and fun this movie is.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I found myself becoming bored after awhile. My daughter wasn't interested in the movie either. Eventually I just walked away and started doing other things around the house. I didn't care how the ending was going to come about. Watch it if you have nothing else to do or watch!

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Like most, there are a few songs I don't like but I'm happy with my purchase for the most part.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This can  keeps you thinking. I love it. This is my new favorite game to play!  I recommend it to anyone!  2 thumbs up!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart dialogue, interesting plot lines, wonderful characters, great acting.<br />A wonderful change from the usual mind numbing drivel that gets aired on television today.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This is one of my favorite animated films and is definitely one the whole family can enjoy. I am so glad we finally have this on blu-ray!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Good quality.  Love the series.  This is one to share with the kids and to pass on childhood memories. Fun
B009GEYX5E|3.0|I had no idea how expensive it would be per picture and it takes a long time to develop.  I didn't properly follow the directions for keeping photos in the dark until fully developed.  I appreciate that they've continued the polaroid experience.  I do miss the original.  But this is a helpful replacement for awesome creativity.
1451695195|5.0|What a well written, truthful story of Eban Alexander's experiences.  We are recommending it to many of our friends--plus we bought 3 copies--one for us and two for friends.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I love this movie. It follows the book very well but keeps the story interesting and very believable. I would definitely recommend it! :)
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Acting was good, but I felt it lacked the character development necessary for me to really relate, and the ending was predictable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is an addictive game. My mum, sister, brother, and I play this nonstop. Right now my mum and brother are playing.
1250039037|5.0|I have not found a book written by Jeffrey Archer that I did not thoroughly enjoy.  I can't wait for the next 3 in this series.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|What can I say. It's Harry Potter. All of the moive in this series have been awesome. Get it. You will love it.
B003WQT2YY|4.0|The director's cut is 20 minutes too long. I got a bit tired,,,  and for those of you who remember the movie, i would say: too many scenes!  there was a reason why some unnecesary and boring scenes were deleted (the silly scene of owner with dogs for one). I would reccomend to get the original version, the one that deserved the Oscars it got.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Love this soundtrack. The drums in this soundtrack are crazy good. If you enjoyed the movie the soundtrack is a must have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it so much fun great for everybody I love it sooooooooooo much I am always on it everyone should have this app!!!!!!!
1594744769|3.0|This book definitely wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It's one instance when I judged a book by it's cover and was wrong. The cover and the pictures throughout the book are brilliant. The story unfortunately does not live up to the pictures themselves. It wasn't a bad read just not a great one either.<br />It's about a boy named Jacob whose grandfather tells him far-fetched stories. When Jacob was little he believed him but as he grew older he realized that his grandfather's tales where too \\"out there\\" to be believable. That is until something happens to his grandfather and, for Jacob's sanity, he decides to do a little research into his grandfather's stories.<br />Like I said, the book wasn't horrible. It went at an even pace. It just didn't seem to grab me at any point. It was just a story that trundled on. There were a few exciting parts but even they weren't enough to make me want to keep my nose in the book. I did love the photographs though. Would have enjoyed a book just full of them rather than this one.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I first started this game on my phone. I then got it for the kindle fire and like the kindle version better. you can see where your going and it uploads faster.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Such great actors, and great story line. Sick show. I would recommend anyone who likes action and drama and suspense
1781162646|5.0|As always I love Stephen King and he doesn't let us down...This is a very good read..I would recommend it
B001NA6096|4.0|I love how authentic this film feels. Filmed in a beautiful location, I enjoyed watching Jesse and Celeste get to know each other on that one long night. Romantic and fun.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I had no intentions of adding a new game to my list of entertainments but this game snuck up on me.  I keep building and going back to check my progress.  It is surprisingly fun but I seem to enjoy these types if games.
B0018GRAE4|4.0|Great tunes, will definitely purchase their upcoming album, these guys can definitely rock in concert as well,  seen them live in Pittsburgh.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Funny I really liked it so I recommend it for any age that can read enjoy it and have fun
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you are a guy and think this isn't for you, give it a shot with your sweetie by your side.  Well done, UK...much better than Bean.
B00008S7KC|1.0|This DVD will not work on any DVD player I've tried, do not buy this DVD. Unless you like owning DVDs you cannot watch.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I don't have much experience in operations, as I am just a mobile and web developer, but this book is still a great read and it teaches you how to think about the big picture.  I don't read many novels, but the story was very compelling and kept you engaged while teaching you about how to be a team player, build IT into corporate culture and align it with company goals, as well as how to think about continuous development and automation.<br /><br />Great job structuring the book and relating it to manufacturing (which I am much more comfortable visualizing)
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Personally, I found this movie boring, and drawn out, even though it was a part of  our history...Interesting for some...
B00005QW5X|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  We've seen it multiple times and will always keep it in our collection.  Thanks for the quick delivery.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is classic for me. I have played it since I had my first computer and it never ceases to be entertain This app has never had a glitch or error and I Like the way way you can tap a card and it moves to the best spot.
B004GYY714|4.0|I chose this product because I already have it on my android phone. I only wish that it had more of my city stations.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love having the MP3 app from Amazon. I've got it on my phone & my tablet. So I have my music on 2 devices plus my kiddo's tablet :0) I've got access set up for everyone to use. It's easy too use and making play list for all makes it easy for all too use. It's free so how could anyone say no? And, there is lots of great deals on music. :0) how do I put it on our laptop?? lol
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|The movie starts off with footage from the 70's of these girls who say they thought they had a ghost, and invited her to live in a doll. But the Ghostbusters say it's not a ghost, it's a demon. The doll then gets put into warehouse 13. And now for something completely different. The Brady Bunch move into a haunted house and find a cellar that was boarded up. A demon tries to be a comedian by pulling peoples legs, and trying to convince some of the girls to enter a wardrobe, probably to take them to Narnia. The Ghostbusters are called in to investigate. They discover that the house once belonged to The Blair Witches sister and she has returned as a demon... *record scratching sound*... wait, didn't they say earlier that demons are not human, they are something else? PLOT HOLE... oh well, GAME ON... so the witch ghost is attached to the kids, she just wants to be friends by playing a game and giving the family the clap. Harmless enough ghost. Oh wait, she killed the dog... bad ghost. Now she wants to possess the mother. Sure, latch onto the kids, but take over the mother, makes sense. Better call for an exorcism before someone throws more balls around the basement and stops clocks from ticking. Uh, oh. You've ticked the wicked witch off, she's not only mad at the Brady Bunch, but she's going after the Ghostbusters daughter too. Better drop what you're doing and get over their before that doll from the start of the movie makes another appearance. Now that doll has been reintroduced to show the beginning of the movie was in someway connected to the rest of it, it's time to put the toys away and go back to the Amitiville house for a wet t-shirt contest of holy water and growling. Throw in a kid who is too stupid to find her way out of the bottom of the house, and then have the power of love be a curious thing, make one women weep, and the other one go back to hell.<br /><br />So, best horror movie in years, ey? Pffft. I don't think so. More like typical horror movie of the last few years, take a dragged out boring first half, pick up speed and get interesting, and then have an ending that does not pay off well. Sniff, Sniff... what's that smell? Is it a fart? No it's the stench of movie makers expecting to make a sequel before they even know if anyone want's to even have a sequel. Perhaps the sequel will explain why so much sub story was put into wondermind woman's horror of a previous case, only to not pay off in the end. It's like they added that, and the doll, and the premonitions or visions as a last minute addition to just add something more to an otherwise pretty slow movie with not much happening most of the time.<br /><br />Trust me, don't bother seeing it in theatres, nor hire it on whatever... just wait for TV and be thankful you didn't waste money on it. Real horror movie fans will see it the way I have, not just be in this fad at the moment for horror movies with half finished scripts that are completed by Twilight/Beiber fans for the finale.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|the ebay app is wonderful. best searching options with the &#34;see more like it&#34; option that I wish ebay offered on their desktop site.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|When a father of 2 children kills their mother, they find themselves being driven into the woods by their on edge father who is unsure of what to do about the situation. On an icy road the car swerves out of control and collides into a tree on the side of the road. The father and two daughters leave the wreck and enter a cabin in the woods (face palm) where the father explains to the kids that mommy is not coming with them. He attempts to shoot the two young girls aged around 2 and 4, but something else is in the house which stops him from killing the kids, and instead reverses his idea. The spirit known as mamma adopts the girls and we cut to 5 years later where the brother of the kids father is still in search of what ever happened to his brother and the kids? Finally they have been found, wild, weird and animalistic like. They are then taken to a hospital or psychiatric care facility or whatever before being put in the custody of their uncle and his girlfriend Joan Jett. It's not long before they begin to notice that something else has come with them, and it doesn't like the noobs.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILER ALERTS: Don't read on unless you want to.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is decent. However out of nowhere comes the idea that Mama is a bad entity and her history is revealed that she is a bad person. Her intention in the end is she is going to sacrifice the kids. Huh? First she rescues them, then raises them for 5 years, only to want to kill them? This protector to killer plot turn made no sense. She does not abuse them, she takes care of them, yet she is only waiting to kill them? Ok then... dumb idea... the kids become animal like and walk like their mama, like a monkey or something, yet instantly the eldest girl remembers how to walk upright and speak English... but the other one remains the same for a while, but slowly begins to return to human-like. Pick a direction already, are they f'd up, or not? They just become normal again and the youngest one they say probably wont speak just wakes her sister in the night by walking normally over to her and saying \\"mama's here\\"? It's not a huge plot hole, but to me it would be like Hulk Hogan breaking character in the middle of a wrestling match and asking for some tea while he plays a round of crochet with the Queen. They may as well have had mama stop to look into the camera, break the 4th wall and say calmly, \\"remember, this only a movie, don't be scared, look at me UN-rendered as a 3D polygon\\"<br /><br />Then the ending. Are you kidding me? The cliff and mama is flying around all over the place? Make up your mind, is she a crawler or a flyer? It went from slightly believable to extremely laughable. And what was the point of the side story of the ghosts baby? She finds it, cries about it, euhh, bugger it, be angry. Was that needed if that's what the pay-off of that sub-story was about? They may as well have removed it all together, as it meant nothing in the movie. Then no big way to rid the ghost witch... nah, she'll do it herself and explode into butterflies. \\"Yes officer, we're ok now. One kid survived, but the other, well the butterfly witch committed suicide with her so we won't be needing her bed anymore, got a number for the Good Will?\\"<br /><br />Overall: sucks you in enough to be interesting, then blows it in the end.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|very good book well written hard to put the book dowm very exciting.the book showed both sides of the war.a lot of reasurch went into this book.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This book is a bridge from the excellent da Vinci Code to  Inferno.  While still having some merit, It is little more than a &#34;beach book&#34;.  It does not dip to the low of Inferno, however.
B0047SF41G|5.0|very interesting plot and good acting and carries on the tradition of past predator movies.  would recommend this for viewing, set back and relax.
B003Z6WFWC|4.0|Given that this is based on actual events, it includes some pretty awful parts of our history as a culture.  Despite that, or perhaps even because of those depictions, this is a movie and a story of hope. Empowering and bold, with strong role models for all living today, perhaps if Mr Zimmerman had seen this film we wouldn't know who he is today.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Got this for my kids but it's hard for them to play. Not for younger children, mine are 3 years and 2 years.
B00406UK5A|5.0|I like this movie because although there was plenty of blood and guts, there was some story there too. It was not formulaic, not too &#34;Hollywood.&#34; I especially like the opening and closing line being the same (which I won't spoil for you by quoting it!) Very clever, I liked the writing and the main character is easy to root for, certainly.  It's one I don't mind watching more than once, so I bought it! It's a go-to movie for me when I need to unwind. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
1401311083|5.0|I bought the series for my daughters birthday and she loved them all. Had all four read in 3 weeks.
B000AYELVA|2.0|I suppose if you want a no-brainer, and are between the ages of 9 and 12, this might be for you. It put me to sleep 5 different times within the first 35 minutesl It's a guy kid's movie.
B002R88G5E|4.0|Excellent read and hard to put down at the end.  Wonderful description of Afghanistan's political issues.  Could almost visulaise the place.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story and even better actors. You tune into their English accents immediately. And you can't wait to find out what happens to your characters next
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome you need to get it!!!! :) I love this game to death the minions are sooooo cute.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This was a great book from James Altucher! It is very real, written in a conversational style, and literally everyone can benefit from reading it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love this story! I have often wanted to go back and change the past. Incredible research. I do nit believe, however, the information our government provides.
B00006RCOB|5.0|I chose this rating because the item met my expectations. I was very pleased. I recommend this item for Clint Eastwood fans.
B001HN6922|5.0|This is a great movie. My son loves it, and watch it almost every day. The quality is very good. Thank you.
B002GOAH1A|5.0|I chose this rating because this was a classic to me and to find it was one thing, but the quality of the item though a classic, was very good.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show has made me laugh through every episode. Zooey D at her finest. I cannot wait for the next season.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|A page turner, written with a great humor. Brings you closer to understanding what Asperger's syndrome might feel like but a journalist with Asperger's here in Israel said on the radio that it's far from really teaching about it. Anyway, I won't be surprised if the book yields a Hollywood film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I haven't really played a better game it's the best.<br />It's challenging to get from floor to floor<br />I literally keep turning the game on and repeatedly doing the last level before the &ldquo;coming soon &quot; levels.
0525953728|5.0|In \\"No Easy Day\\" you get a firsthand account of former Seal Team Six leader writing under the pen name of Mark Owen. He gives an amazing account of what it takes to become the elite of elite and simply make Seal Team Six to begin with. Then he goes on talking about many different missions in great detail from him and his teams perspective. What these guys sacrifice is simply amazing. Their normal schedule was do a tour, one week off, then go right back to constant training until the next tour. Most of his team members were well over double digit tours by the time the Bin Laden raid happened. His account of the Bin Laden raid is the best one you'll find anywhere with the most amount of detail. This team, and this man, truly are America's best in uniform and it's great such a wonderful book has illustrated things that normal people just cant understand. Highly recommended book!
0062238868|2.0|A poorly written book. This story of a SEAL at war is boring - the &#34;action&#34; repeats itself again and again. No real insight into the life of a SEAL. Save your money.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|Tracey says...I'll run and you follow me. (smile)<br />This is not so much Christmas songs but songs that speak to emotions that may come and find us at Christmas time. Let's be honest...do you remember that first Christmas you stayed alone in your apartment and didn't go home? Maybe you were on campus. Maybe working, or too broke to make the flight. What about the year that the Christmas feeling never found it's way into your heart and you staggered through the holiday like something precious had left you forever. ummm...maybe breaking up two weeks before the 25th and you sit staring at that bracelet you bought for the one you thought would always be in your life.  Tracey...God she's sooooo on point, I cried on \\"Sister Winter\\" half way through when those jaggling guitars took me back to a snowy college town December 25 years ago.  But it's Christmas time, a hopeful time. I summon the strength to push back the years like Mrs. Thorn recommends and in the face on darkness find a way to throw out JOY.
B000026F4H|5.0|Just to add my voice to the chorus of praise here for this excellent album.  Two real guitar virtuosi in Chet Atkins and Mark Knopfler produce an immensely enjoyable disc, clearly relishing each other's company.  It is country-tinged, full of fantastic guitar picking from both and manages to have real musical quality while being thoroughly good-natured.<br /><br />If you like slightly country-flavoured music, fantastic guitar picking or just an enjoyable album of good songs performed by two real geniuses of the guitar, this is for you.  Personally, I love it and, twenty years after its release, it still gives me huge pleasure, raises a smile and causes my toes to tap involuntarily.  Very warmly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome frame!!!!!! A must for real thinkers... download this and waste hours of hour life...must joking have fun ..great game.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The book is better.  I'm retired and enjoyed watching the movie with my great nieces and nephew.  Now I'm enjoying introducing them to the book.
B007SSEZNA|1.0|this movie is lame and wasn't even worth downloading.  my family is dumber for watching this worthless production.  is the same producer as babe the pig movie or what?  :(
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|My great aunt gave me this book to read.  I loved it.  I watched the movie and re-read the book.  Now I've purchased it for my great niece to read.  That's 5 generations that are still reading and loving this book!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case. I usually switch cases every month because I get bored but I will be keeping this one for a long time! If I get bored I will just switch the color. I have an 8 month old that grabs it sometimes so I need it to be lifeproof and it is! It has a very slim design which is great. Also I like not having to worry about screen covers. I would recommend this to anyone but especially moms!
B0082SU98U|5.0|I loved the book and movie when I was young and enjoyed re-reading it now in my retirement!  Did I buy it for me?  Of course not.  I have a great-niece and nephew that enjoy reading and am hoping they'll enjoy it as much as I did.  I'll let you know when they get through reading it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very captivating book. Couldn't put it down.  Great details and and easy to understand.  Would highly recommend.  Read entire book in 2days.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a classic and will always be a classic.  A classic for my generation and a must read for our younger generation!
B00821OX98|5.0|I like this series, it is interesting and a different slant on an alien invasion. The resistance fighting, running and defending the civilians
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|These minions are so cute, and I like the slapstick humor that was remenicent of the Three Stooges era. :)
B000AOEMXM|5.0|It was a birthday gift to my husband and he is enjoying the series very much, he's loving it and watching episodes every day.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|This is a great movie no matter how many times you view it.  We had our grandchild over and got this so he could watch something more geared toward young children.  No bad language and no out of control sex .  There are not too many movies today that keep up with old time morality.  This is one that does.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|What a horrible movie, Lol It was so bad, half way through we stopped watching it, my husband is never going to let me pick a movie for movie night again.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|No question- This series is my favorite TV show. Harvey and Mike the man's men. Both live extraordinary lives with ordinary problems.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|So Funny and cute! It even got my one year olds attention, she was laughing as much as we were. Must See.
B00BI745AA|4.0|This is a good reversioning of the clasic Victor Hugo book that was turned to a musical some years back.<br />It is very operetic and less sing-songy which is why I have enjoyed it. Hugh Jackman is very good, and Russel Crowe suprises.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It dont have the one in there that I need help on.  You skips so many level in this help guide
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful! It was great for me because before getting the app I felt more disconnected with faith and God  but this app helped me get in the habit of reading the bible and growing in my faith. It is also very easy to use.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Recommend this book highly.  Beautifully written - unique story and plot - intriguing mystery<br />I can't wait to read her other books!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great series.  The story is well written in all 3 books.  I couldn't put it down.  The suspense in the story was great as well.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I watched the HBO series before reading the book, so i was already familiar with the characters and much of the plot line. That said, there is always enough variation between a book and a screen production that I still enjoyed the differences, and the different perspectives on the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|:D this game is really fun. so much better than 100 floors! some of the levels are difficult but they're all solvable!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is perfect for an on the go game. I like how easily you can upgrade and change armor suites. It fits the movies well. Great game.
B00B10HAO2|5.0|I had looked forward to this movie coming out for quite awhile.  It did not disappoint.  I have read several biographies about Hitch and this presentation fit in with what I had read.  Let's face it though, it's hard to find an Anthony Hopkins movie that does disappoint!  I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of either man.  Very nicely done.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I enjoy this album way too much. My soul rejoices in the amazing-ness of the sounds produced by these wonderful muscians!
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|This app is far from on-par with its Firefox brethren. The subscription list is cryptic and fixed. You are unable to have your own white or black list. It creates network errors in apps that other blockers do not. Enabled or disabled it still shows as enabled in the Notification bar. I was previously using AdAway and reenabled it because of the poor app ad blocking by this app. I'm just about done with this app unless I can find some use for it. It's an amateur attempt.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Love this game!  Had trouble starting due to the lack of directions, but once I got the hang of it, it was great!
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|Ridiculous that love can heal zombies and the acting...yikes. Glad we only paid $3.99...too bad I can't get it back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!  Had trouble getting started because it had very little directions, but it was great once I got the hang of it.
1455121924|4.0|The book contains some very enlightening information about wheat and how it has been modified over the years and as a consequence why so many more people (including myself) are sensitive to gluten today. In reading about the different side effects gluten can have on the body I was able to identify symptoms I have been having not knowing they were as a result of consuming gluten.<br />I bought the audio book version and my only issue was with the narrator. He has a very authorotative, momotone voice and the points of levity throughout the book were lost on his voice.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! Recommend for all. It is a tear jerked that provides an insight and a desire to become a little more kind to all those among us.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is very easy to understand how to accomplish the tasks required to advance to the next level. Would recommend to any age group.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is over the top silly and is stupid fun, I love it! It has great graphics and the gameplay is great,I have no complaints!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I chose this rating because it is the start of a great series by GRRM. It takes awhile to get really good. I liked how it feels like there are multiple stories in this book.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|Overall, I like it, but the songs get a bit repetitive and it's missing Exile Vilify.  The case in good condition and the extra were in the case.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Modern-retro. That's how you'd describe the general theme of this album. You can tell there are heavy disco and 60-90's sounds mixed in throughout the album. The preview gives you a pretty good idea of what you'll be buying.
0887431453|1.0|This book was half the size I thought it would be. Not worth it with shipping and handling charges. Wish I had went to a bookstore you could open up books and look at. Good book but not enough work.  Not worth price plus shipping and handling.  Book will not last long and I will need to buy much more material to teach them concepts they only introduce briefly.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I really liked the way different emotions that a man and a woman feel in a relationship is shown here.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game was okay. It was really slow, didn't let me do one type of combination and couldn't open it at first. It might just be my kindle though. Let me know if u have a similar problem by leaving a rate stating that. Thxs. How they can figure out this glitch.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I liked the old weather channel app. More than this one, the radar was more easy to use.so I give it one star.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|all in one mahjong app is just a free teaser.  To play any games, you need to buy each type separately--not my idea of a free app
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I am not normally a historical fiction reader but this is such a great book. Super character development. Intense plot. Just great stuff!
B008IJTFYW|1.0|Here's another so-called &#34;free&#34; app.  It plays about 30 seconds and then, if you want to listen to anything, once again you have to pay to get your selection
B002SAS26E|5.0|Don't be scared off thinking that this is just another trading game. It's a fast play, and easy to learn (I play with my 13 year old grandson), but there's a fair amount of strategy involved.<br /><br />I played this online at Board Game Arena before purchasing, and still do. Kudos to Asmodee for allowing BGA to run the online version. Sort of a &#34;try before you buy&#34; kind of thing; though, in this case, without BGA I may not have ever heard of Jaipur, let alone purchased it. (Sure, there are probably folks on BGA who never buy the actual games, but comments in the forums suggest there are quite a few who do. Everybody wins.)
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|I've made this book a regular part of my meditative reading, spending time musing about each small, snack-sized tidbit of wisdom that applies across a broad spectrum of what you might face in daily life. This book shows a remarkable level of insight, shaping thought with every well-chosen word, and reaching the very soul of the reader. I recommend it very highly, and I read it often.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so funny I love it and my kids love it you will really like this app and the minions are the funniest part. A must have.
B0067R0APK|1.0|The update requires permissions which have nothing to do with displaying the weather.  Obviously they are selling all of your information they can grab and want to grab more.<br /><br />How about fixing the app?  Maps still do not work.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Great Show. Great Cast. Engaging Story Line. There Aren't Enough Superlatives To Describe This Show Accurately. I Love Every Second Of My New Addiction
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the sound and the beat have it playing in my car. the price is right and sounds great so go get it.
B00013M6NK|5.0|An extra battery is always great to have on hand.  As long as you remember to charge it.  Unfortunately, you have to charge the battery while it is in your camera.  Bummer! :(  But I did see an external charger is now available.  Just can't afford it right now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun but its to much like temple run. I like it. Please give more keys though so that I can stay alive more.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The Band Perry is great!  I own this CD and it is worth purchasing if you are a country fan.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read the other crossfire  novels this book was nothing less than an awesome read I can't wait until the next one comes out it definatley will leave you wanting more to the story
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|The Simon Pegg-Nick Frost combo is always a win. Nice to have a blu ray copy for the big tv in the living room and a DVD for the bedroom.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. It's. Challenging,  but not too hard that you get frustrated.  It requires a lot of common sense!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love this series! The best book since The Last Olympian. The ending was epic and heart wrenching at the same time. Stop reading this review right now and buy the book!
B004LWZW42|5.0|The main characters start out at the same point as far as school, but they deduct different things about life and the world from their drastically different personal histories, which ultimately leads them in opposite directions. It is all about the choices we make, and what we do with the things that happen to us.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Every Single song is good. No seriously, EVERY SINGLE SONG is good. I have not seen such a well produced album since Chronic 2001. Best album released since Kanye's The College Dropout.
B000AXWV40|5.0|I love this album.  I remember the first time I heard it, in high school.  My friend had an older brother who was away at college in NYC and he had turned her onto it.  This album blew my little suburban mind.  I think this is the first P-funk album to buy IF you aren't looking for something to dance to.<br /><br />Side note:  I believe this is a remastered edition, but the volume is still pretty low.  On the first gen CDs you really had to crank it up.  This one is a bit louder, but I still have to turn it up about 10% compared to other music.  Not complaining, just making an observation.  It's probably just as well that they left it that way instead of adding more compression and changing the way it sounds.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The story line is good Tarintino once again is great Jamie Fox is perfict in his role. The slave depiction is graffict and the<br />N......word is used constantly. This is a good movie. This is what happened in the 1850's.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|It's very simple to explain this cable worked as advertised and now I can enjoy commercial and subscription free music in my car!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Well, for something so small works great, I used for my kitchen knife and now cuts great, not perfect, but great, at least I don't suffer any more trying to cut vegetables. And for a Leatherman MT, well It does a good job and its compact, so you can carry this sharpener anywhere
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ya yo get it you will love it no joke get its free lol buy it if you just love horse no joke its free I love his app
0061122416|5.0|This book is one to read over and over again. Coelho offers prose to sooth the mind, spirit and soul.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game it's so fun and I liked that u can connect on Facebook on the game I love it!
B00005QW5X|5.0|When I heard what it was about I was like meh. I saw it and wow ! I loved instantly! It was definitely not what i thought it was going to be. I played it for 2 other friends and they went out and bought it as well. It's just one of those instant cult classics. Sort of on the level of rocky horror picture show, but i like this more than rocky horror. I highly recommend, but not to people who are homophobic.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved every second of the movies, and I am a 26 year old adult female.  It was so cute.  The quality on my kindle was impeccable.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|CATCHING FIRE IS BY FAR MY FAVOURITE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY BOOK EVER! Suzanne Collin's just loves messing with us by leaving every chapter with a cliffhanger. I could never bring myself to put the book down after each chapter because all of the cliffhangers just made me want to read on. I love how Katniss is still determined as ever but this time it's for Peeta to win and not for herself. She is such an amazing character you can't NOT love her!
B001F4YOP2|5.0|This  is  by far  one  our  my  favorite  Cruise movies it  shows  the  witty  and goofy  side  of  Tom. Superb acting  and  story  line it  shows  he  had it  then and  look  where  he has gone  from here
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This is by far one of my favourite books! It's so heart breaking but I guess that's cancer, right? Hazel is such a strong female character, she has to be my favourite female character aside from Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games Trilogy)
0425263908|5.0|I purchased this book about a year ago and stared it and got bored; really bored.  I did not read into the hype of this series, but in my opinion, the book started off slow.  Then...one day after reading these reviews, I opened it back up.  I literally could not put it down.  I fed my children, bathed them, and put them to bed...but that was about it.  I could not quit reading about Eva and Giddeon!  I really loved how Cross would not let me in...he would not open up.  Then slowly he left us crumbs and I could put the pieces together to an extent but was still left wondering.  After finishing book 3, I was lost...wanting more.  I simply cannot wait until Sylvia finishes books 4 and 5...it may hurt me to wait!  If you liked 50 shades of grey, you will see many similarities but this series blows that one out of the water! You must read this series!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great acting, special effects and storyline make this one of the best SCFI on TV.  Highly recommended by a SCIFI buff like myself!
B004LWZW4C|1.0|This isn't a problem that only I'm having by the looks of some other negative reviews. This was a fast successful transition using Amazon.com but this blur ray will not load/play in my LG blu-ray player no matter what I try. Many other people are having the same problem with their Samsung players or with their PS3's but it looks like some LG players (fully functional with all other blu-rays) won't play this disc either.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Sachi humble, gracious and astonishingly non bitter story telling is awe inspiring considering the opulence showered on each parent while using the very same opulence to slap her in the face seldom sharing their lucky fortune.  To have one Narsistic parent is bad enough, but to have the other &#34;spiritually&#34;  evolved one spew book after book on mindfully aware notions to only ignore ALL teachings to abuse and malign her only daughter is TRAGIC.  SO impressed in through it all Sachi remained lovingly kind to them when they deserved no such respect. Bravo. As they say true forgiveness frees the soul from the very reason for the forgiveness in the 1st  place.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the graphics and the levels.  Good thing they start out easy so a person can figure out what the heck to do.  It is fun to figure out where the clues are and how to use them!  The level of difficulty increases so it becomes more challenging as the levels go up.  It also can be more frustrating, but that's what a game is supposed to do.  I think you have to be a patient and detail oriented person to really get into Can You Escape.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Lot's of action and the story was light enough not to weigh down the speed but not so light as to be mindless action.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I like this game because each level increases in difficulty so you gradually get to know where might be a good place to look for a clue.  It is reminiscent of computer games back when they first started and there were no pictures, you had to guess your way out of a situation by stating possibilities.  I don't know who could have solved those, but am happy that we have now advanced to the point where you can find things by actually seeing the clues!  Sometimes the levels are frustrating as the levels go up, but that's what makes it more challenging.  (I have to write down the numbers and colors to keep track, though! Don't have a photographic mind!)  Looking forward to more levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved figuring out all the different clues and how to piece them together to get out. Someof the rooms were hard but that made it even more fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this game because it starts off easily but increases in difficulty so that it is a good exercise that takes your mind off of anything else.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Good, and well done.  Expensive tho given the $4.99 price tag - should have been at least 3 times as long for that kind of money.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter: The Seventh Season ;  what do you want me to say.... its not like you plan on ignoring your own dark passenger!  you will purchase it, why are you even bothering with the reviews...
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Been playing for a week and a half, and all of sudden it keeps saying update failed. Overall it's a great game but can someone explain the whole update thing.
B009AMANBA|4.0|There are some powerful performances - this presents Lincoln like I've never seen or read about him.  Truly a man of the people.  Reconstruction would have been far different if he'd been allowed to live.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is so cool. I got this game two days ago and I am already evolving my triceratops it's so AWESOME!!!
B001AQO3QA|3.0|The Menu's for the movies are poor.  Its hard to navigate through them.  If for instance you change something its difficult to change it back without restarting the whole blu-ray player.  Also, the widescreen isssue....  I'm not sure this plays in actual widescreen.  I've tried and tried but I keep getting a version that is cropped.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it is a very good app but after about a year it will get boring because you have do everything you can and you get bored I have been though boredom but may not bee the same for you anyway this is a great app all together
B00BKU9ZFU|4.0|This is a fine piece of music and vocals which should be in everyone's music collection.  You will not regret it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this rating simply because this book is excellent. It took exactly no time at all for me to feel for these characters. All the communication between characters felt fluid and natural, and they felt terribly human.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love scrolling through all the recipes, gift ANC craft ideas. It's an app to use and I like that you can cat prize all the stuff you \\"pin\\" your way. It's very user friendly and free!!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|No matter how many times I watch this, I find new ridiculous things to laugh at.  Having a young Jennifer Anniston in the mix helps.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|The browser is wonderful, opens up a lot of browsing opportunities. I used it to get Flash and it works.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was a great season, but have tissues ready. The twisted are surprising but done so perfectly. WARNING. If you didn't see the first 2 seasons you will be lost.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Any one who likes to read historical fiction will enjoy this series.  How politics,greed, and social status affect real people, and shaped the world.  I really enjoyed reading these books.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I've played other variances of this game, just with different skins to commemorate holidays. But this is the real deal for Mahjong, with the actual tiles I played with as a kid. I'm sure I'll be ditching the other ones and just play this one, but I really love this Mahjong engine. Easy to play, knows what my finger wants, is smooth, and just gets me. And only a dollar!!! If you love Mahjong, you HAVE to have this in your game collection.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I downloaded this to record my professors lectures and it is amazing!  Fantastic noise/background cancellation makes it super easy to hear everything, even with a professor who changes the pitch of his voice throughout!  Very pleased with this app!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I could not put this game down until I beat it. What a blast!!! I was a little confused at first, trying to figure out the correlation between matching three objects and the guy just running around. But once I realized I should be concentrating on matching certain tiles depending on what my guy was doing at the time, the game got fun. I liked the RPG aspect of it where you can upgrade yourself until you are good enough to cross that 10 million point level.<br /><br />I've played my share of match three games, and this is easily in the top five list.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Very much a Die Hard movie. Lot's of action and blood. Great for a Bruce Willis fan. Love the fact he is playing the estranged dad.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I got this as a FAOTD, hoping it could give helpful battery information. It's okay. I didn't like the battery widget, so that didn't last long. I do like the estimated battery life and the numbers it gives in the notification area. I wouldn't have spent a dollar for this, but I've been using it without complaint for over a month now.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|The book goes into great detail about how John Locke sold 1 million ebooks.  His advice is contrary to most of the other advice out there, but how many books have those other \\"experts\\" sold?  His process might not work for everyone, but the book will give you some food for thought.  If you find even one idea that can help you sell more books, the book would more than pay for itself.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Controls were easy enough to master. A slightly different type of game than what you would find out there. Not too bad for a dollar. Graphics are decent and everything moved smoothly.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show has become one of my all time favorites.  I love the character development.  The ying and the yang of the character relationships continues to be compelling.  You will love these characters.  You will hate these characters.  Ultimately, you will appreciate the utter humanity of these characters.  This show is well written and a joy.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I think nearly everybody who likes to pass the time gaming on their android devices should have this in their \\"must have\\" list of games. Especially for only a dollar. It is fun and, I hate to say this, pretty cute. Runs smoothly on my S3 and it seems like one of the better crafted games available. If you've played and enjoyed cut the rope, you HAVE to pick this one up.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I haven't got the game because the bar doesn't fill but I still played it on iPad and it was awesome so get the game even if it costs you.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|It generates ambient noises on your phone, putting some nice background/white noise while you try to sleep or meditate. I figure that an album that promises the same thing could easily go for ten bucks. Not only is this a third of that price, but it allows you to personalize it to what you want to hear.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This one is as good as Hosseini;s last two novels.  It spanned three continents ad the protagonist emerged a conqueror in spite of some sad beginings
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|A little overpriced at three dollars, I did find this game pretty fun, entertaining, and challenging. I do love a good game that gets you thinking and needing to outsmart others. This game does just that. You have to move your penguin around collecting fish and trying to get other penguins knocked off your little island. Fast-paced and challenging.
193700788X|1.0|Maybe Harris needs to stop watching Trueblood. Also, Sam, really?!? I just am not on board with this turn of events. Number one: what person ever when seeing one of their oldest friends dying wouldn't save them - why does this somehow mean she's in love with Sam? And could she have ended things with Eric in a more sloppy and incoherent way. Even if I wasn't rooting for Eric I would have found this tying up loose ends pathetic. The opening of the book was unnecessary and so badly written. It was done very differently from any of the other books and it hurt the storyline. I don't see the value in seeing the deal with the devil since we hear all about it later - it's just an odd mystery plot device that didn't work well at all. Also, since when is Sookie this pathetic moping character - she's not being played by Anna Paquin in the books at least let her stay true to character there. Man she just lets Eric steamroll her with little to no reaction and was she really dumb enough not to get that Eric was behind Sam's distance? And I never got any sexual tension from her and Sam at least not to the extent that I saw them in a relationship. I also think that suggesting at the end that Bill and Karin might get together was weird. Overall a poor ending to this series. Too bad. No effort was given to this book and you just erased Eric and acted like it fit his character that he would let her go. Shame shame Charlaine! You blew an amazing opportunity to make your characters interesting god forbid they ever be more than two dimensional puppets.<br /><br />Here's the one sentence sum up. You can't tie a ribbon around Sam's dick and expect it to be treated like a gift.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This is not an easy movie to watch, but gives one a sense of what it might really be like to experience the many effects of a tsunami, and the days directly after surviving it.
0062255657|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible!  I've read many books by Gaiman and this is definitely one of my favorites!  I'm recommending it to everyone I know!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Do you really need to read another review of this film to be persuaded to watch it/own it? Nothing can top the charm and surprise of the the first MIB, when you, the viewer, learn what Will Smith's character learns as he learns it. This one beats MIB 2, in my mind, with strong performances, clever plotting, lots of heart, and fun to see how the 1960s version of MIB technology was conceived. OK, a few plot holes, maybe. Just enjoy the ride. .
0790729709|5.0|Whitney Houston was such a good singer.  It was too bad how she lived her life and how it ended so tragically.  Kevin Costner is a good actor also.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Latest update is not that great. Too busy and not as intuitive as past versions. I had to search forever to remove hourly details. Also where are the change scale buttons on the map?
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Yanni is one of the best musicians in the world.  His music is so inspiring.  I have his other concerts and enjoy watching them too.
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|Red (a.k.a. Retired Extremely Dangerous) is like the Expendables with even older people, adding more comedy, and not being as fun.  Like the Expendables Red brings in many famous actors like Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, etc. and they embark on a crazy adventure together.  In the film these individuals are retired CIA agents.  However, because of the CIA hunting them down they are forced out of retirement and kick ass once again.  It is an awesome concept (especially with such big names), but one that does not live up to what it could have been.<br /><br />First off the entire story is very basic and not deep or engaging at all.  A simple story can work if I am entertained, and in this case I wasn't really.  The action scenes are nothing to run home about.  They were alright, but I have seen much better in countless action films like Expendables and Expendables 2.  The villain played by Richard Dreyfuss is lame as well.  He is very basic and has no depth what-so ever.  Plus he gets defeated way too easily.  A big problem with the film is that the final action scene is extremely anticlimactic.  The heroes beat the villain without much of a hitch.<br /><br />The characters are hit or miss for me.  Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox are a lot of fun in the film.  Bruce Willis does a good job performance wise, but I found his character to be bland compared to most of the rest of the main cast.  Carl Urban's character I did not really care for either.  He is presented as a rival for Bruce Willis but comes off as more of a nuisance.<br /><br />Sarah Ross, who played on the show Weeds, I did not like at all.  She plays Bruce Willis's love interest and the token damsel in distress.  I found her useless and very annoying.  In terms of the comedy her jokes were the weakest and did nothing for me.  She was really only in the film to appeal to a demographic.  She should have been left out and focused on the maingroup kicking ass.<br /><br />Overall, Red is a mediocre action film at best.  Some of the characters are a lot of fun.  However, other characters were annoying like Sarah Ross and Richard Dreyfuss's character.  Plus you have an uninteresting story, bland villains, and mediocre action scenes.  I know that this is based on a comic.  I do not know if this is how the comic was because I have not read it.  If you want a good action movie with big name actors watch the Expendables.
0812993845|4.0|Wedding Night is a chick lit comedy about two sisters. Lottie is carefree, starry-eyed and a hopeless romantic. Fliss is responsible, sensible, nurturing and protective. The book begins with Lottie breaking up with Richard \\"The One.\\" Within pages, she rushes into a rebound marriage by way of marriage to an ex-boyfriend. They run off to a honeymoon. Practical sister Fliss is appalled at the news. She is doing everything she can to stop her sister Lottie from consummating the marriage so it can be annulled. Operation Stop Wedding Night in full effect.<br /><br />Who would've thought someone would sabotage a honeymoon? Let alone your own sister! Wedding Night was the perfect funny story of when honeymoons go wrong. The characters were memorable. I could relate to both sisters. Even though Lottie is cray, she wants the fairy tale of being swept off her feet and in love. What girl doesn't? I can also relate to Fliss' responsible and level-headed side.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is my favorite chick lit author. Wedding Night is another success and great for a summer beach read.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read 50 Shades and let's say I liked it, not my favorite book, but it was good. Since I read it I start looking for erotic books but with a story behind. But in EVERY book I read: 1. One or both of the characters had childhood issues that made them mentally damaged (just like 50 Shades), 2. Were just sex sex and more sex, without a real story. This is not the case! It's perfectly written, with a real story behind, very real and it's female main character it's not as stupid as in other books! I really enjoyed reading it and TOTALLY recommend it! Just one more thing... It's written from a guy's point of view, so it's kind of shocking for some women. In my case it made it even better, because it's not &#34;Oh my God he is so handsome... I love him&#34; all over the book, It's more real! In my opinion: A perfect 10!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Love this movie!! Great quality! Perfect for everyone who experienced being some kind of outcast in highschool. Everyone can relate to this movie!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The writers of Castle continue to work and weave their artistry in Castle Season 5.  I will, of course, be purchasing the DVD set when it comes out in Sept.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Not  a movie to watch more than once, just ok. Very good story, but too corny. My 20 year old son like it though.
B00DL47ORO|5.0|Everyone should see this movie to learn the truth about orcas in captivity. It's a terrifying, heartbreaking, well-constructed argument and the images and interviews will haunt you. I can't wait until an equivalent documentary is done about other forms of animal captivity like circuses and zoos, etc.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Old Man's War has a very interesting premise and Scalzi is a very awesome writer and the book captures your attention until the end.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Cumberbatch and Freeman make a great duo in this refreshing reboot. Sadly it's only 3 episodes (or mini movies), but the show begins and ends leaving you begging for more.
B009X01ELC|5.0|NO PROBLEMS! Works as advertised- everything! I am completely satisfied with this item and would recommend it to anyone. Bought a cover at three times the price and it wasn't half the quality. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. One of those times when you feel that you've got it right.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game seems like it's fun, but every time I get to a certain part where your \\"battling\\" vector it freezes trying to show you what to do and I can't get passed it. It's frustrating but if that would work I'm sure this game would be great!
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|My favorite Jane Austen.  Great acting and locations.  What a view a Regency British aristocracy.  And British sailors.  Love Ann the heroine.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The show has very interesting legal twists and turns that often get me thinking about the moral dilemmas inherent in the judicial system, despite the fact that, imperfect as it is, it is the best system on earth. Love the Eli Gold character especially. He is so quirky, manipulative yet endearing - I get a good laugh from every one of his scenes.  I also really like Diane Lockhart's character, and her clothing is awesome. As a women who for religious reasons, likes to dress in more covered, modest clothing,  I would love to know where the wardrobe people find such beautiful yet modest career wear!<br />Looking forward to Season 3.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Could NOT put it down! Loved it from the first word to the last. Ironic/funny that he kind of does the same thing to his readers than what that Dutch writer does to Hazel. I kind of expected it. :-)
B00CL68BK2|2.0|Was very disappointed.  I love these two actors.  It just didn't keep my attention.  I waited so LLLLOOONNNGGG for something interesting to happen....turned it off before it finished
B002KGEORM|5.0|The only bad part about season 2 is that season 3 comes after it.  That was probably the worst season. Season 2 was awesome
B004D23BRU|4.0|Peter and the Wolf is one of those stories that I'd always heard about, but never read. I didn't even see the old Disney short based on it! Somehow, the story always seemed to slip by me, while I'd be reading about Little Red Riding Hood and many of the other classics. Tonight I wanted to watch a movie, and while my queue has barely been touched for the last year, I decided to go with something I recently put on there- this version of Peter and the Wolf. Yeah, it's barely over 30 minutes long, and is more of a short film than anything. Still, I started it up, and my daughter decided to join me. She loves stop motion movies too, and even likes it when I show her the special features for movies like Fantastic Mr. Fox where the puppets and their sets are shown being brought to life. So this was a cool bonus for her.<br /><br />Peter is a young boy who lives in the woods with his grandfather. They're well-protected from the outside, having a massive fence built around their home. Peter has a duck that's basically his only friend, and one day they head to town for some chores. Advertisements for the circus are everywhere, with a ballerina bear shown on the posters. Poor Peter bumps into some local ruffians while there, and they throw him in a dumpster and even act like they're going to shoot him with a rifle after he's been dumped. Back home, a crippled bird lands by Peter and the duck. It wants them to go outside. They eventually do, and that's when it starts. Their home is protected for a reason- there's a wolf prowling around outside, and it has its eyes on these easy targets, which also includes a very fat cat that came out to get the crippled bird. Weaponless, what's Peter to do?<br /><br />Because the movie is so short, and it's based on a well-known (aside from in my case I guess) tale, it's hard to not spoil the story. We'll just say that overall, the movie isn't too dark and yet it definitely doesn't sugarcoat anything, featuring a small amount of blood and onedeath. My daughter is six years old and she wasn't disturbed by any of the imagery or violent scenes. It was a downer for both of us when a certain death happened, but it isn't lingered on. I was really impressed with the puppets used in this movie, and most of the animation is fantastic. There are only a couple of times when something wasn't animated very well (the cat drying its legs after it fell through the frozen pond stood out). It's nothing major, and it easily forgiven, especially considering this isn't a huge feature length film. Details like Peter's facial expressions say more than words ever could.<br /><br />Speaking of words, no one talks in this movie. This may bother some, so it's worth mentioning for those who don't like this for whatever the reason.<br /><br />After the movie was over and I went to rate it, my daughter saw that I was going to give it 4 stars, but insisted that it should get 5. I was surprised! She was into it, and even quit playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf about 5 minutes in. It's always a pleasure to see new stop motion films, and this was certainly a treat.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|addictive puzzle game. few levels are similar to previous ones, however keeps you engrossed till you finish all the levels. too few levels will wait for new levels and hope they are complex
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|Children love this game. They love clicking on the mailbox and having the squirrel peak out and make noise. They love it
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love the Disney princesses! The Scottish background to the story is really fun and unique! It's totally worth having!
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|I've seen this game around, and thought I'd give it a try sometime. Still as a single player game it falls short on several fonts.
B008220BLG|4.0|Being kind of a zombie fanatic, there were a lot of details these zombies didn't stay consistent with. Nonetheless, it was a cute love story and had a happy ending!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Angry birds taken to the next level was complete success. I won't get into the nature of Angry birds, but I will say that the added feature of space is awesome. My complaints is that firstly, it dosen't come with a lot of levels, yet. They'll obviously be putting more in, as they do with all the AB games, but it's a bit slim pickings at the moment.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Well is a very light and nice sharpener, but seems to be so fragile!!! so be carefull !!! u dont want to break it!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had a great deal of trouble putting the book down and stayed up several nights longer than I should have.  You can't help wishing the circus was real and that you were one who wore black and white with a  scarf of scarlet.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|You get Volbeat!  This CD rocks and is just plain fun.  Some songs are more metal, some more rockabilly, but it's all well done.  In my opinion, this is the best of the Volbeat CDs currently available.
0062255657|5.0|I read this in one sitting, as most fans will.  It captured me, took me in, and by the end, I had a lump in my throat.  I can really not recommend this enough.  Ocean is certainly not a Magnum Opus of a book, but it is what Neil Gaiman does best, weave a web and draw you in.  Well worth anyone's time to read...
B003EVWDR0|2.0|Avatar is one of the most visually lush films I've ever seen, and great attention to detail was paid to the world of Pandora and the culture of the Na'vi.  Unfortunately the same cant be said for the plot and the acting, both of which were extremely weak.  Maybe I could have overlooked that on the big screen, but not on a TV screen.  Save your money for the re-release when the sequel comes out and watch it in the theatre.
B007G5O3K0|4.0|Certainly worth your time, if you know who he is.  Well worth it.  The solo work is always something I am hesitant about, but once again, it is not A-Ha, but it is Morten...
B00DU73T08|1.0|The picture was very pixilated.  We tried watching it on different devices and got the same result on each.  Very disappointing with what we paid for HD.
B004U8VX2M|2.0|the writing and acting is so poor compared to the new hit show, Downton Abbey. I suppose back when it was on, it was ok, but nothing like Downton Abbey!
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Although I've always worried about the military-industrial complex, this book showed me what the good guys in the MIC are like. And it showed me what the good guys think about the overwhelming masses of bad guys in the MIC. It also showed in a very entertaining way, how much attention to detail in necessary in this type of advanced program. Finally, it made me again proud to be an ethnic Jew, like the author, and like Irving Berlin, who wrote \\"God Bless America\\", \\"White Christmas\\", and \\"Easter Parade\\" and donated his royalties from the first of them to charity.<br /><br />I'm also educated in physics, and the simply-explained science in the book was great, in my opinion.<br /><br />But most revealing was the avarice and ineptness of politicians, many corporate managers, and especially the military brass. The accomplishments of the Skunk Works (stealth, the U-2, and the \\"SR\\"-71) are made more astounding in the face of all that.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|I'm a dude, and I like movies like this.  I thought this movie was entertaining and good.  It is a definite rental, you won't be going back to it time and again like The Notebook.  A good story, with good characters, and alright actors, but not as good as The Notebook.<br /><br />Definitely check it out!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game is a lot of fun and the graphics are neat.<br /><br />However, there is one particular section where the game freezes and crashes every time. The platform that the Minion is running on splits and you have the choice to go left or right. If you follow the steps to the right, there are a series of 3 doors/tubes that you can enter. It takes you to a level with a bunch of buses, and after a few seconds, freezes and then shuts down.<br /><br />I want to rate the game higher, but this is really an issue.
B00DU73T08|2.0|Ok, so I'm a dude, but my GF and I actually like the Twilight series, and I generally like 'pod people' type movies, so I was looking forward to this one.  I rented it the other day and found this movie to be terrible...  Its the story that's bad, just awful.  The actors in this movie are great, unfortunately the movie is just blah.<br /><br />I would say that you either skip this movie, or wait and watch it for free on tv or borrowed from some poor sucker who bought it.  I don't know anyone who liked this movie...
B008CX2A2I|1.0|[...]<br /><br />This device has a major issue in that it insist on auto connecting with your device once paired.  This is fine if you only ever use BlueTooth for connecting to the Onkyo receiver, but if you wish to use any other BT device while in range you will not be able to.  Also if you leave or turn of BT on the paired device it will re-connect when it is back on/in range and change the input on the the receiver, potentially interrupting if you where watching/listening to another source.<br /><br />Onkyo's response has been non-helpful and lead me to not only no recommend this accessory but to recommend not buying Onkyo at all, especially if BlueTooth connectivity is at all a priority.
B0093ST02E|3.0|It was a decent movie. Seth Rogan did a awesome job being in character it's just sometimes the movie was slow for me and my wife but overall it's not a bad movie just not great
B005FFW46S|5.0|What can I say about Terry Pratchett's books?  Brilliant, insanely funny, thought provoking, and always entertaining. It's not a surprise that he is compared to Kurt Vonnegut, and Mark Twain, because of the biting satire, originality and wit.<br /><br />Snuff, like many of his books often addresses serious matters. In this book, the underlying topic is the subtle and not so subtle way that Racism belittles and dehumanizes it's targets, and how often beneath much of it's practice there is an all important economic factor, in addition to jingoism, plain stupidity, and tribal ethnocentrism. In a similar way it also illuminates class differences and how that leaves an almost indelible stamp on one's outlook on life.<br /><br />Of course you can simply enjoy the book without much attention to how it reflects our world culture and society because it works very well on many levels.<br /><br />I very much recommend the audio book version of Snuff which is read by the incredibly talented Stephen Briggs who brings all of the characters of this Terry Pratchett novel to life. Briggs uses his amazing vocal talent, including his vast library of voices, accents, mannerisms and interpretive genius to make this story even more vibrant for the reader than simply reading the printed page on one's own.<br /><br />As much recognition as Terry Pratchett has already received, he deserves far more, especially from the dull witted, unimaginative, self satisfied mainstream literary establishment.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This is a great movie. me and my wife have watched it multiple times and still go back and watch it here and there.
0143144006|5.0|This is for stroke patients, caregivers and professionals.  I'm a professional that's worked around stroke patients for 40 years and I learned a lot for this book/CD.  Beautifully told.
B00AALX5SI|5.0|Great movie for all ages.  My wife and the kids were watching it so I decided to watch it with them and it turns out I rally like the movie and thought Katy Perry did a great job.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The Good Wife is better than a good show. If you are a fan of courtroom dramas, this is the show for you!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|this is really a great movie. After renting it on Amazon we purchased the DVD and have seen it multiple times and a lot of our friends have barrowed it and have said the same thing that this was a great movie
B008602KQI|5.0|I found this movie to be fascinating.  The thought of the world being controlled by a select group and dominating food supplies and other services is interesting.  Worth the time to watch.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I haven't finished but it lives up to the authors past efforts, so far so good.  He is one of my favorites.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|There was so much drama through the whole book, most of it I thought was just for page fillers. Although the book was good, I believe it could have been A LOT better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Would like to see more levels soon. It doesn't drive you crazy trying to figure it out but its not too easy.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Love this book even as an adult! Would love to read it to my niece when she's older and my kids.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Works great, use it to play mkv files, have had no issues.  Did not test Hdmi out.  And it was free!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|One of the best storyline I've read without involving a complex delivery.  A simple read compared to the world of Tolkien but entertaining nonetheless.  Found myself less attached to the characters I liked and more of an anticipation to the dates of the characters that I don't like.  Highly recommend for nature fantasy readers, but would advise to wait until all the books of the series is released (although that may be much longer than anyone dare imagine).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the next season!  This show keeps you hooked.  Great acting, great storyline.  Loved it! I highly recommend it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Mac Brooks definitely put in a lot of work in writing this book.  I can tell his extensive research by the way he wrote for different cultures.  I like the book over the movie because the book examines our humanity which fits in the big picture of human beings saving ourselves.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book club discussion.  The town shunned the family, the DA defending his son, what really happened.  We all loved it.
1451695195|4.0|It was a quick and interesting read.  I love that he is so passionate about his experience. Overall glad I read it.
B007SGM084|4.0|Plain and simple I read it for the sex.  My husband certainly was glad I did.  However, if you looking for rich content you wont find it here.  The author is repetitive in her use of adjectives and some of her descriptive writing falls flat. The story line is average. Overall, I am not sorry I read the bundle it was hours of entertainment, even after I put the book down.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|No clear instruction on how to play the game.<br />Don't understand the game.<br />Whatever instructions are provided are if I blink I had missed them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest  is like having a subscription to ever kind of magazine,  so many categories so many usefull things.  Everyone I know who has pinterest loves it!  I have already used some great  idea's I got from Pinterest,  like buying a couple of magazine files to store my flip flops and small clutch purses.  There are so many more I want to try,  its great,  you will love it!!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I came to read the book via the HBO series, which numerous people claim to closely follow the book. The huge cast of characters and extensive back story is introduced moderately and in a not overwhelming fashion and the characters are humanly portrayed. I look forward to reading the entire series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy solitaire,  fast enough to play while sitting in traffic or at a doctor's office and just anytime. If you like plain old solitaire,  you will like this.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is good.  It is a cross between Boston legal and Ally McBeal.  I'm looking forward to the second season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My family was away and I watched the entire season in 1 day.  It was addicting and all day long I kept saying &#34;I'll only watch one more episode&#34;.  Next thing I knew it was 11pm!  Loved it.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|I think Splashtop is really better for android or other OS's than it is for the touchpad. I wasn't too impressed to be honest.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it.  Great acting.  Great story lines.  So many twists and unexpected scenes.  I can't wait for season 4.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I need this office app as this is the only thing I have on my android that can read and write documents.<br /><br />It's a bit difficult to use no matter which phone you have and it's not perfect.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft. I love it so much, I can honestly say that I am addicted to it, pocket edition and online. The only problem I have with it is that when I open the app and start playing, it freezes and kinda crashes. Turning my kindle on and off won't work. I have to fully shut down my kindle after it freezes. Otherwise, by all means but this app. It's worth the seven dollars for sure.
1853751960|5.0|This is a really good advertising book. People think advertising has changed and it's lightyears ahead now than it ever was, but this really has all the core concepts.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Hey everyone!<br />Just like a lot of you have been commenting, I too had been experiencing some problems with the app vTube. It wouldn't let me watch videos of the people that I am subscribed to and it kept crashing. So I decided to talk to the developer and they told me that this bug will be fixed immediately! In the meantime they told me that you could create a playlist in your YouTube through YouTube.com and and then after you uninstall and reinstall your vTube app, you just log back in to your account(on vTube) and watch your playlist where it says \\"other\\" on the sidebar! It worked for me so it will definitely work for you too. Other than the bug that will be quickly fixed, I think this app is amazing and let's you watch great quality videos. I gave this app a 4 out of 5 but as soon as that bug is fixed I will make that a 5 out of 5 no doubt about it!! Hope this helped some of you(:
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It just keeps repeating the same stuff. After a while you don't really feel like playing it, not sure how people can use this forever.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. Augustus and Hazel are perfect. A perfect book to read on a hot summer day. Or any day.

B00915G6NK|5.0|What an awesome season! I DVR all of the episodes so I can watch everything all at once. Needless to say, I couldn't tear myself away from the TV for an entire weekend (don't judge, you know you'd do it too!!). Further development on the Kensi/Deeks situation with sparks flying so high I was surprised my rug didn't catch on fire! Their chemistry far outstrips the Tony/Ziva romantic ambiguity.<br /><br />The cases are exciting and the endings tend towards the unexpected. And despite her diminutive size, Henrietta Lange is not someone you want to mess with. Her stoic stares and cutting one-liners provide the glue for the entire dynamic team. Don't ever cancel this show!
0385349947|5.0|Reading this book was like having a mentor right by my side. Highly recommended - especially for young  professional women.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are pretty good for a mobile device, but when playing the paddock game sometimes I can't pick up the manure or weeds, and the grooming game could go a bit smoother, but other than that its a fun game and its a great chance to have your own horse to ride and play with, along with feeding and grooming and keeping the horse happy and the bond strong...
B004EBT5CU|4.0|In addition to the popular tunes you hear over and over on the radio, the rest of the selections are very good too.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This game is great and very fun. But it is kind of buggy and lacks some major features, like a full deck builder for the campaign. This will irk some fans but the sealed game mode is fun and gives some good depth a nd strategy. However I think the game would really benefit from more cards to go with this mode. Lots of room for improvement that needs to happen if magic wants to stay popular digitally when Hex Shards of Fate comes out later this year. Besides that, great game for fans and New players.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Not a very believeable story line.  The movie was way too long.  I just kept waiting for it to end.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I discovered Orson Scott Card through this book, and although I've read a number of his series since then, this one still stays my firm favourite.<br /><br />Ender's journey, stating with him being a scorned, bullied kid and culminating in him doing what nobody else could, is sad and exhilirating all at the same time.<br /><br />I could not put it down, and when I was done, I simply had to get the next in the series NOW!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I loved it as teen, and I still love it now... This movie brings me back to the 80's. :-)
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well written book about a true hero. Thank you Adam Brown for your service and thank you Eric Blehm for telling his story.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a gift, and he and I both love the movie..I would recomend this movie
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Misused actors, bad pacing, and missed the mark on what made the original a classic. This is another example of putting special effects over strong story-telling, hoping a brand will carry it to success. I love Sam Raimi, but his manic flourishes don't fit the setting, especially when the stage is weak to begin with.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this film! I love the story, I love the music, I love the scenery, I love the costumes, and the actors are superb!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story was so good and hilarious, I was laughing through most of it. I read it as Drew telling his life story as if you were watching a show. He has always been the man that would never (never say never) fall in love. Then he sees Kate in a bar and can't get her out of his mind. Until he goes to work Monday morning to meet the new employee, can you guess who that would be? Yes, it's Kate. She falls for him but will not tell him because he is a playboy and not interested in a relationship. Drew has never been in a relationship and has some what of a hard time figuring out his feelings. When he does, he becomes a jerk and loses Kate. It takes all he has to win her back. I LOVED it. This is a first from Emma Chase and I look forward to reading more from her.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|I like the two songs they play on the radio the best. It just sounded kind of homogeneous otherwise. I've only listened to it once, though, so maybe it will grow on me.

B00138KFYO|5.0|I used to have this on a dubbed tape. I'm glad to have it on mp3 now. Janis rules. It takes me back to my college days.
B008220BP2|5.0|I love this movie.  It has a very unique twist and puts you in the shoes of the zombie instead of the few remaining survivors.
0738727326|3.0|I really like the art on the cards and can't wait to try it. I had to buy this from barnes and nobles because I had purchased this one from amazon BUT I received only the deck and I should have known because even though the description says it has a deck and book, it had the word deck on the title. I was confused and because things are not clear online, I decided to get it from a physical store in which I can actually see what I am buying. Physical stores are always the best to get something if you can as online isn't trusting. Overall, the tarot set is really good. I highly recommend this.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I'm enjoying this show a lot.  Things just...happen in this show.  You don't expect most of it, and the list of people you thought were alive, but were dead grow.

B004TMPJP6|5.0|When Astrid announced they were closing I was in search for a to do list manager.  I found Wunderlist and have been very happy.  It is Astrid with bonus features.  The syncing between my phone, Kindle and broweser is great.  Would recommend this app to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it not as cool as having your own horse but as far as games go I personally love it
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|I wanted to have a movie night with my sons (ages 7 and 2) and introduce them this timeless classic. My boys sat still for the full 2 hours (which I never expected) and were enraptured by this film. I loved watching it through their eyes.
B007SGM084|5.0|No shame in my game, I loved these books.  Sweet romance and healing tied up with some BDSM.  From page one, remember everything between Christain and Ana was consensual....every single thing!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|When I first read the description of the book, I didn't think it would be something that I would enjoy.  Then I kept seeing it on the best selling list & the reviews I read in the newspapers were very complimentary. Out of curiosity I decided to order it.  I am so glad that I did.  I could hardly put the book down. The characters had great depth, & although some of the names of characters & towns were hard to pronounce it took nothing away from the story.  I am so glad that I read this book & would highly recommend it to anyone.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very good keyboard for smartphone. It really increases the typing experience.<br /><br />Write messages and mail become a pleasure again. A &#34;must have&#34; for every android devices.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is my favorite author and I have not read a bad book from her.  I have read her whole series at least 3 times now.
1885167776|5.0|A must have to bring some sanity to today's hyperspace and disruptive world; title is a bit misleading.<br /><br />Picked this up from local B&N last week and read it past weekend. It's a great read for folks with idea generations/strategy as a strength, the folks who are always on the look for best way to do things and the ones who strive for all around performance of any system/organization. We easily get spread thin when we plan our time to work on multiple things at the same time, and I believe that authors have compelling (sometimes supported by case studies) reasoning behind their rationale to attain focus on this which matter the most (in different aspects of a system/organization). If you go by title or just skim through the book, you will miss the point (hence some bad reviews) as authors don't suggest that you focus on one thing only; what they are suggesting is that you focus on most important thing in each area (from product development, marketing, personal development, financial stability to personal relationship improvements). I plan to re-read it occasionally to reinforce some of the concepts laid out in this book.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|A fun weekend of revisiting this old favorite. Sure it is very blue screened at times but it was top of its field in its day. So with that in mind-it was delightful to see the old cast again for the series that we remember in our youth so well.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I read this book over a weeks vacation. It was enjoyable from start to finish. If you enjoy Grisham, you'll enjoy this new hero, no matter your age. I know I did.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I was playing this on the pc until I got it on here and it is much better than the computer with the new towers and challenges I really recommend this
B000WZONL0|5.0|&#34;Not to know what happened before your were born is to be forever a child.&#34; Cicero<br />That struggle to end the evil of abortion is hard.  Watching this movie has given me renewed courage to work harder.  William Wilburforce struggled when others told him to quit.  But like the Energizer bunney he kept on.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Furious 6, the sixth installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, does what The Lone Ranger refused to do: it creates heroes who unironically stand for the right thing, all the time. It also proves that a such a moral-driven movie can still be a lot of fun. Albeit by ditching reality for a ton of big action. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense. But there are a ton of cars.<br /><br />For no real reason, Dominic and his friends have risen from small-time criminals to the sort of person that an ace DSS agent turns to for help in catching an international terrorist. He does so. They help him, in hopes of reconnected with Dom's long-time, presumed dead girlfriend and of getting full pardons for their considerable crimes. A ton of action scenes held together purely through character moments and a terrible plot ensues.<br /><br />A plot point involving Paul Walker being sent to prison under a fake name, in order to get information from another criminal about Shaw, the guy they're after, makes very little sense, and serves no plot purpose. It's basically done in order to connect to the past films: Walker meets his buddy from the first film, and then is threatened by the villain from the fourth film.<br /><br />Gina Carano still needs to learn how to act. She also served very little purpose, probably because the editors realized her acting was so bad that they needed to trim all her lines. She gets like a dozen in the whole film. It's sad, as she's possibly the best fighter in the entire film: her subway battle with Michelle Rodriguez was a highlight.<br /><br />Plenty of humor came organically out of the film, both when it was trying to be funny and when it wasn't, but the situation was so fun and ridiculous that it became funny. But when the film tried to create it's own, purely humorous moments, it fell flat. There's a scene where Ludachris and the Rock humiliate a British guy who was rude to them by forcing him to take off his shirt and pants. It really wasn't funny.<br /><br />The focus on family was a little strong: it was harped on every 20 minutes that they all stuck together because family never leaves anyone behind. Still, it's refreshing to see a film to blatantly sentimental. It works throughout the film: at the climax, I still felt that the stakes were high, despite all the past carnage, because the family was being threatened.<br /><br />As long as you don't mind valuing fun, moderately moral adventure over logic, this is a fun film. They have a post-credits scene teasing a seventh, but it remains to be seen if they can actually top themselves with it.
B004B8DH98|4.0|The dvd mechanically, worked without a problem.  It is not a &#34;feel good&#34; movie. There are no heroes,  However it's real and intense .  ,It is interesting because of the complexity of the main character.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This book kept my attention all the way through.  He is a great suspense writer.  I look for his books.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a good book to read. I was shocked at the ending. It is also sad, and difficult at times to read but worth it.
B000FC0P9E|4.0|Hanging on to the idea that you could relate to your baseball idol when you in dire circumstances is as an interesting concenpt.  I kept reading it all the way through and thought it was a good read.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|If a woman believes in domination as a sex tool, this is the book for you.  If not, most women will dream of the sex and forget the domination aspect of this series.  I hated it.
B003R0MF5S|5.0|The ratings never set records and frankly I understand why.. Chuck was awkward and awkward can he hard to handle in a hero...  The series was a cult hit.  It was quirky, it was fun, it was endearing.  It reminded me of William Katt and Greatest American Hero.  Another short-lived semi-hero.  Chuck is great fun.  The characters, the chemistry, the writing made it all so easy to watch...and watch again.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It grabbed my attention and kept it.  It was a concept I found hard to imagine being in a movie.  I thought man would ultimately dominate animal but that didn't happen.  I'd read it again.
B008Y729FU|5.0|I have always liked this movie. I like the story line that it has. I also like the characters in the movie.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Hilarious and cute for all ages! I might have enjoyed it more than the kids! Definitely becoming our new favorite!
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|I would surprised that I would like this movie.  It was entertaining and kept me engaged.  Was it the best movie ever?  No, but it was at time hilarious with Nick Cage and his on screen daughters antics.  Not one I'll watch over and over, but one for the books.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|LOVE JOHN GRISHAM AND THIS KID IS LOTS OF FUN, LIKE THE SERIES EVEN IF WRITTEN MORE SIMPLY THAN HIS OTHER BOOKS
1451627297|5.0|I thought there was no topping the likes of &#34;Langoliers&#34;, &#34;Misery&#34; or even &#34;The Green Mile&#34;.  This book which he started long ago, is actually now my favorite of all of his books.  Time travel, mystery, love, heartache and a little suspense, something for everyone is included in this well written book.  It took me to an age I wasn't born in but long for a glimpse at it's simplicity and innocence.  For some, it's pages dragged on but for me, the amount of detail transported me and I wanted more.  George Amberson (aka Jay Epping) seems like most teachers who are into their craft.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and appreciate it's length for the great level of detail that was necessary to bring back an age that for some adults has never existed in their lifetime.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|THIS SUBJECT HAS FASCINATED ME FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND THIS WAS WONDERFULLY WRITTEN BY A SCIENTIST WHO CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR IT OTHER THAN IT HAPPENS.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I am happy for Dr. Alexander and his family, that he is alive and able to live as a normal person.<br />I am also happy for the fact that he seems to be convinced and positive about \\"consciousness after death\\".<br />Good for him!<br /><br />I missed in this book:<br />1) Copies of the hospital documents with the diagnostics, diagrams, etc.<br />All what a doctor would need to confirm Dr. Alexander's clinical descriptions and statemets, would prevent from being tempted to think, the book is fiction.<br />2) I was not able to understand why Dr. Alexander was first in a state of \\"pure consciousness\\" without being aware of identity, and in a world with no subjects, and from that moved to a world with subjects, identities, revelations and communications. What is the afterworld? The first one, that he presents as proof of universal consciousness, or the second one that looks to be built on some vague guidelines of christian religion?<br />3) Dr. Alexander says, his neocortex was inactive. But deeper regions of the brain were not.<br />I would like to know, how he can exclude that the generic feeling of consciousness he describes first is generated be other regions of the brain but the neocortex, and that the later self consciousness with interactions occurred when he was near to wake up?<br />4) Again about the first state of Dr. Alexander: Could it be, that such is the general experience one faces while dying, the minutes when shifting from alive to dead?<br /><br />Dr. Alexander makes much effort to describe himself as previous unbeliever.<br />I find it hard to take him seriously when he later populates his world with Reverends, psychics, etc, that he formerly knew and frequented, and when he says he was a churchgoer.<br />If he really was an unbeliever, he hardly could have been a churchgoer and friends with the Pastor.<br />From his admissions I understand that he was a passive christian, probably apathetic.<br /><br />I try to imagine to have had exactly his same experience. I would not arrive to his same conclusions, and I would probably remain atheist.<br />I want to finish and add to this, that I would prefer a world with a loving god and with an afterlife. I am sorry our real world hardly seems to lack such features!
B005GRF2UK|3.0|I have purchased most of the Jane Eyre DVD available. This one is mediocre. Also, it does not follow the book authentically for those of you who are purists.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show, and season 3 does not disappoint. While this particular series does not move fast, it still has its own version of high class drama and suspense.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Band of Brothers is an excellent of Company E, 506th Regt. from Normandy through the end of WWII. The book is even better than the DVD series.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I have serious misgivings about a lot of kids' media.  I get tired of the absurdity and various forms of disrespect that are pervasive in most kids' movies and t.v. shows. I have no reservations about this one, though.  This and &#34;The Gruffalo's Child&#34; are two of my favorites.  If you like these, you should also check out some Scholastic DVDs that similarly translate popular children's books into great, truly kid-friendly movies.  As a bonus, they are also fairly short which is perfect if you don't want your kids watching a screen for many long hours per day.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It would be very difficult to equal or surpass The Kite Runner.  Although there are some interesting (and well developed) characters here, it seems as if Mr. Hosseini is really trying to describe (through various characters) the recent history and problems of his native country.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|beautiful songs. great production. I always love his voice. Seen the show on PBS. Mr. Foster did execellent job putting together<br />an ensemble of great musicians.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I got this so my granddaughter would enjoy it but now she has her own kindle and I am enjoying it...LOL Thank you!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great.  I love to play it any hour of the day.  I can grab it on the go while I am watching the kids.  It also helps to keep my mind fresh and alert
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I thought this was a game I could play on my Kindle but, it looks like you have to be on line and play with many other people.  I don't have access to wifi that often, so it's not what I thought it was.  Plus I remembered that I always found Bingo to be pretty boring, and it still is.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I do not play but my grandchildren do.  They love it.  Even the girls play it when they can get it away from the boys.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.it kept my attention right away and I eagerly looked for to getting back to it. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|If you've played UNO on Facebook, it's about the same. Fun filled and always a good time. It's free so take advantage and download this ASAP!
B00BF11STU|5.0|My husband has wanted to see this movie and the price to see it through PRIME was good.  The movie itself was one of the best I have ever seen, well-deserving of its' several Academy Award nominations. The violence was minimal, considering the subject matter.  This movie was well worth renting!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Every time I have to get up for school I use the Alarm Clock to help me up because I can't get up in the morning because I'm not a morning person. So people out there if you need an alarm clock get this one it helps you a lot it did to and it will do to you.
0756407125|5.0|If you have any free time and love fantasy novels, read this book and the one before it, The Name of The Wind. Terrific books. The writing is amazing; the books are hard to put down.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Easy read for me , I will remember the atomic weights for uranium and platinum for the rest of my life now
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|For years I used another brand battery pack, however I became weary of having to re-cell it, and never knew when the female connector was going to cease working.<br /><br />I purchased 3 of these CP-E4's, and have been very happy so far. I use rechargeable batteries.<br /><br />Like others, I would like to know how much battery life is left, but that is impossible with this unit so I have an additional tray filled with fresh batteries in my pocket just in case. Also, I wish the part my belt slips through had velcro on it.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Okay so I have this app on both my kindle and iPad it works perfectly on my iPad but it works horribly on my kindle fire. I mean this is my 3rd time downloading it. So this is a great app and all but it has a few kinks and glitches.
0679745653|5.0|Light read by a fantastic author. So descriptive. Think Holly may be his alter-ego. Enjoyed the 3 short stories at the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I have no problems and the game is like taking car of a real horse, no complaining for me.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|Don't do it!<br />Save your $6, wait 6 months and this will be on network TV and you can watch it for free, or better yet, don't bother.<br /><br />Seriously, how they got Jeremy Renner to do this movie, I'll never know.<br /><br />This is a horrible movie and takes the lead as the worst movie my wife and I have ever sat through. (yes, we watched all of it, which I suppose does say something for the movie)<br />It's basically a really bad 'zombie' type action movie, except the zombies in this case are evil witches with special powers.<br /><br />Possibly teenagers may enjoy this, I did laugh twice (I'm sure the 'director' did not intend humor).<br />I realize I'm light on details and analysis but that's because I don't want to have to 'think' anymore about this movie.<br /><br />Look, we all like to forget about reality and lose ourselves in a movie, possibly this movie does achieve that but just watching the flicker rate on your TV screen would also do that.<br /><br />I am only adding a review because this movie is currently rated at 3-1/2 stars! I feel I just have to warn you.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews mentioned Blade, Van Helsing, Zombieland and I would add any of the Resident Evil movies, of these I would say it's on par with Van Helsing, possibly slightly better only because of a few explicit special effects.<br /><br />Watch it at your own embarrassment, don't be surprised if you are mad at your self after.
0316247545|5.0|This book provides so much more insight into the intricacies and details of Ponyville and Equestria and gives a great deal of background information as well as. It is a must have for Pony lovers of all ages!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This app is quite fun to play, although it is what I call a &#34;panhandler&#34;. The app is free but constantly bugs you when you have run out of credits. Similar to Candy Crush, you must buy additional credits to continue play or get bonuses.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Product was delivered promptly as was stated.  Have used it to sharpen serrated knife and did a very good job.  Works as advertised.  Will be very useful.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you are reading these reviews, you area already interested.  Why wait any longer. Start your journey along with the  doctor and you won't look back. The first season does a great job of introducing you to the serious and filling in the backstory. I still have a couple of seasons to go and it had been the most fun I've had with a series in quite a while.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|Nothing deep here, just gadgets and explosions, good guys vs bad guys, revenge and lost loves.  Just sit back and enjoy
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The characters are fully fleshed out and grow even more humanoid like each season.  The growing relationships that we have come to love and expect make this worth seeing each week.  Who knew life could be so hard for a genius.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good deal as a free game. I enjoyed it. It's just challenging enough, without becoming too frustrating. Totally worth it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Great story line, well developed characters. Drama, action, love...it has it all. Give it a chance and you wont be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very awesome! I honestly love this game. but, being a horse rider who's very particular about riding, I get annoyed with the eq the characters have.... HEELS DOWN ;)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|so far this is a great app for all horse lover's.  its like Sims with horses. graphics are great for a free game
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is probably the best show I've seen on TV for the following reasons.<br /><br />1) it isn't 'reality'<br />2) great casting<br />3) great writing<br />4) it isn't another phony cop show
B0064MPXFA|5.0|For years, I have heard from my coworker about how great this show is.  But I never have it a try until this summer when another friend mentioned the show.  I am so glad I did!  I joined Amazon Prime just to watch this show and it has not disappointed.  The writing is great, not contrived.  The characters are very believable, and complex.  The acting is great and I appreciate the strong female characters.  I am only on Season 1 and look forward to watching the other seasons.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|Got it so my niece could see a classic great movie, grandparents watched it also. Love this movie. Get this if you can.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game had me addicted as soon I it started. The graphics were amazing, the story line was interesting, and the puzzles challenging and fun. However, I finished it the first time in a matter of hours, and the second time in less than two hours (with interruptions from kids!). I've had the game for 24 hours, have completed it twice, and really have no use for it anymore. I feel that, for as little actual game as is there, they should let the user know before buying. This game was fun, but I'm left feeling jipped over how short it was.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: I originally rated this game 3-stars due to the shortness of the game. I've since changed my rating from 3 to 4-stars. After finishing the game, I let my 12 year-old niece play. She enjoyed it so much, she played through a second time. Then my 15 year-old nephew also went through and completed the game. Currently, my 9 year-old son is trying his hand at the game, and my almost-7 year-old son and hubby are awaiting their turns at this game. I figure any game that can please so many people is worth more than 3 stars.<br /><br />Additions that might be nice: the ability to have more than one person play through at a time (even two save files is better than one!).
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher. 6'5\\" vs 5'4\\"!!!! Really!!! Come on. The book is so much better. Don't waste your time watching this film.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Oh, my...where do I begin?  You will laugh, you will cry, you will THINK and then you will think again.  I wanted to keep reading well into the night to find out the next happening.  I mark it as a MUST read.
0805092447|5.0|I got this for my grandson to read at home while his daycare teacher was reading it at school.  I found a great used copy for much cheaper than the bookstores sell.  To me, used books in good condition are a no-brainer when compared to new prices.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I ordered two of these items the same day.  If you could explain to me how to use these,  I would be grateful. Thanks BJ
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Great watch.  Very enjoyable for any fans of Chaplin and Robert Downey Jr. alike.  The casting for this movie was excellent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It has also kept me busy on many car trips.  Fun to play and try to beat.  i am hooked.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I decided to enjoy what I have today. This movie had more substance than most of the \\"non-animated\\" movies I've seen lately.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game has me hooked I love it.  So fun. I play all the time and like that I don't have to be on the inter net to play it.
B009LDXQGW|3.0|Although I think that the weekend is  an interesting artist, I cant help but feel depressed after listen to his album. I mean I definitely like Wicked games and love his rendition of Dirty Diana but i just could help but to feel depressed after couple of his other songs. Maybe he had a lot of sadness when writing this album because i can totally feel it in the music and maybe that is his niche to write sad songs.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Well researched. Fiction but on a high intellectual level.  Perhaps the director and writer were involved directly in the sciences so it appeals to the educated class.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Music is great and upbeat! The lyrics are intresting though because there's a bit of a rough life identified throughout the songs that i wasn't expecting but it makes for an good music set.
B00BD6EJRK|5.0|I do not just give apps a five unless I really think they are useful.<br />This app definitely deserves a five! Very useful editing software!!
B0033PQUXA|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is one of my all-time favorite films.  It tells the story of a successful Italian movie executive who looks back on his early life growing up in post-World War II Italy.  We see him as a mischievous altar boy with a love for movies, and then as a teenager who falls in love with the new girl in town.  Guiding him along the way is Alfredo, the grizzled projectionist at the movie theater, who becomes a father figure to him.<br /><br />This is a sentimental movie, but it is not cheesy.  There is both love and heartache.  A love for movies oozes from every pore of this film.  In fact, it may be the best movie ever made about movies.  The final sequence is one of the best scenes ever filmed--it brings me to tears every time.  Cinema Paradiso is currently rated #73 on the IMDB Top 250.  It won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as a slew of other awards.<br /><br />The quality of the Blu-ray transfer is mostly good.  Most daytime scenes are richly detailed.  There are a couple shots, however, that are very poor in quality.  They looked like VHS.  Thankfully, they were brief.  Nighttime and indoor scenes vary in quality.  Some are sharp, while others are grainy (although never to the point of being gritty).  The sound varies as well.  The dialogue at the beginning of the movie sounds like it was being uttered in a tin can.  But this was soon corrected.  Thankfully, the moving score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone comes through well.<br /><br />My old DVD version had both subtitles and a dubbed version that was actually pretty good.  This Blu-ray edition has only subtitles, however; the dubbed version is missing.  Nor does it have any special features other than the original theatrical trailer.  Thankfully, this disc did not include the director's cut, which I hate.  It adds about 30 minutes of material that wraps up the love interest portion of the film, but there is a reason that it was cut from the US theatrical release.  It turns Cinema Paradiso into a different movie, and that is not a good thing.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: This movie is rated PG for a few instances of sexuality, mostly implied.  There are a couple of very brief scenes that show upper female nudity (they are clips of old black-and-white movies) and one scene that shows bare buttocks.  There is some mild violence.  In a couple of scenes, a mother slaps her child repeatedly.  There is also a scene where a teacher is punishing a student for poor performance in the classroom.  A scene involving a fire might be intense for younger children.<br /><br />I highly recommend Cinema Paradiso.  It is one of the best films ever made.  It is a \\"must see.\\"  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, the improved video clarity makes it worth it.  But the loss of some of the special features, particular the dubbed version, is a bummer.Cinema Paradiso into a different movie, and that is not a good thing.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: This movie is rated PG for a few instances of sexuality, mostly implied.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Not what you'd expect from a cop show. Can't wait to start Season 2!<br />The six or seven seasons will more than pay for my Prime membership.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|If you read the above you will see just why I do not doing these. My evaluations cannot even be submitted withiut making some positive or negative comment about my choises.  It shoud be sufficient to see the star  rating given and leave it at that.
B00821OX98|4.0|There are not many good science fiction shows on television right now.  This show is a good combination of visual effects, writing and acting.  A definite two thumbs up.
B004ADH1RI|3.0|We gave this a 3 ased on my 9 year old review. He said it was interesting to watch, but the kids did too many things that they weren't supposed to, and it was scary...he didn't like seeing some of the things it showed.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was enlightened about the lives of the black slaves living on the plantation.  Having just returned from a visit to the south it was particularly poignant.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in this area of our history.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great action movie. Good story line. The heroes were all great in their own respective right.  The special effects were excellent
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My little brother loves this game and all the other talking friends apps thank you for the talking friends apps
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|This seems to me to attack as fast as you can and hope it happens to fall your way. No control of resources, where and what to build. Just attack with the ships you are given, which is always 20-25 percent less than the computer is given. Looks good, just no game play.
B0031R5K68|5.0|Love the background details about Masonic Order; the surprising twists; and the fast pace. Really nasty villain; interesting heroine in Katherine Solomon; and overall a great page turner !
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great for adults and teens. Spent several enjoyable evenings with family and friends playing this game.<br /><br />I would recommend this game to anyone.
B000FC130E|5.0|This book was so wonderful to read! I love how Gaiman can create a world around you through his characters and settings. The plot was great with its twists and the growth of the characters was phenomenal. This is another example of great writing from an amazing author!
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Warning - Not for children! Sensitive viewers may experience disturbingly graphic dreams after watching this film. This version puts the original Evil Dead to shame. Watch at your own risk.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought that this book would be over-hyped, but I ended up loving it. Would recommend to anyone seeking an engaging, emotional read.
B002APU580|5.0|Set in a time period in which love and marriage were often two very separate things for a variety of reasons (mostly societal), this movie is surprisingly romantic as well as empowering--a must see for those who believe that money doesn't necessarily buy happiness and that true love really does conquer all.  Great story, superb cast, beautiful sound track!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Lots of historic facts blended with a spell binding story that holds mystery, suspense and just a little touch of romance.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Having two dogs of my own, I completely relate to this book. It is funny, and sweet at the same time.
B0051OZ564|5.0|This is a straight-up fun movie! Pretty dark, but it's amazing! The visuals, the writing, the music... it's a blast!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This was a good action movie.  It was true to the series.  The movie knew what it was and wanted to be and achieved its goal.
6305181810|3.0|This is an OK movie. There is nothing to get excited about. Old plot. Big business exploits the small guy. Hero lawyer comes to the rescue. Big deal. It's ok, but nothing to get excited about. I honestly feel that the only great film that Coppola ever made was The Godfather.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Maybe if you are under 60, it would be fun but didn't impress me at all. Maybe if it was explained better it would be fund
B008X8P8A8|5.0|Total War Battles is well worth the purchase price. The game is very complex, combining resource management and basic unit control to set up large scale battles in Japan. Units include different types of swordsmen, spears, cavalry, monks, archers, and gun units, all with their own unique skills and attributes that encourage you to employ a variety of tactics to defeat your enemies.<br /><br />Levels have different goals, including total domination, killing a specific number of units, and survival, along with a large number of optional puzzle levels you can complete for power-ups. Though the campaign mode is a little short, there are several one-unit skirmish maps you can play after winning to hone your skills.<br /><br />Trust me, you'll love this game.
B006SAR6P8|4.0|modern day king-fu! you have the beauty of the past meshed in with the violence seen through the eyes of a kid playing a video game.<br />I'm not a comic book fan/anime...but qt's film has made me re-evaluate the things I consider interesting in my life.<br />bonus throughout the film was the immediate impact the RZA will play in the future of movies. bravo. this film is balls!!!
0062280228|5.0|The most perfectly written book since the beginning of time.  Thank you, Neil Gaiman, for holding my hand as I dipped my toe in \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane.\\"
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Been years since I've played magic. I had a hard time putting my kindle down. I wish I could play against my boyfriend on the old kindle but it doesn't have Bluetooth. Can't seem to play against him on the ps3 either. Oh well.

B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock did not disappoint in the least. What a grand production of a present day version of and a real life portrayal of genius along with hyperactivitiy gene. This series just challenges the viewer at every scene.  Open your mind, be alert..don't miss a thing. It is better than putting puzzles together.  I love the two characters as they figure out their friendship together. Great stuff. I want more, more.....!!!
B0090SI4OC|5.0|To truly appreciate and enjoy this movie you must read the book.  Stephanie Meyers is truly a great writer and although hard to top Twilight, this comes very close to it!  Again, read the book first.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Futuristic, creatively different experience. Not the same ole same old...<br />Not hip hop, not pop, not rock... it needs its own name
B00AECGQF2|4.0|It is a fun game and once you get it you are addicted to it. After a while (1-2 months) it gets kind of boring. One thing I wish was that it had more stuff. Other then that I totally recommend it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|SAMCRO making sure that Charming stays in their hands is always a treat to watch. If you thought MC's were outlaws of a different sort then SAMCRO will no doubt reaffirm that belief. ROCK! Murder, scheming, pornography, prison, leather, cops-on-the-take, and self absorbed ole ladies make for a slutty scum fest that rivals all on television. Watch it.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Good read. Fast moving bit it could have provided a little less detail that became redundant in favor of providing explanations in places that were vague.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My whole family is completely addicted to this show! We are constantly talking about it and predicting what will happen next.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Jury is still out on this one. Having trouble getting it to work right. Haven't given up yet, but close.
B005PK57IK|4.0|The characters continued to develop and the plot is interesting and holds one's interest. It moves at a good pace.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Really good game, especially when you have nothing else to do. I really enjoy it and it's quickly becoming a favorite!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I literally could not do anything productive this weekend because of this show. To say that has a wonderful plot and story is a gross understatement. The characters are well developed, and all them provide an insight to what life must have been like outside London in the Victorian era. The show itself is truly Superior...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing<br />The trains start going slow then they go fast and you might hit one I think you should buy this game
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|im an IT person and don't get me wrong but I had a intel cpu all my life but a big thanks to their overly priced cpu that made this amazing chip possible.<br />the best bang for your buck!!! be reasonable, be AMD. nuff said.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|I watched this DVD in reverse, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I watched all the special features and extras on Disc 2 before I watched the film on Disc 1.  I did this because I'd never seen the film before.  I had passed it over many times, but recently began to notice that it was very highly regarded among critics and fans of the Western genre.  I had also recently just revisited Sergio Leone's Man-With-No-Name trilogy, watching them with my boys.  So my intererst was piqued, but I wanted to really do my homework about what was so special about the 3-hour film I was about to see.<br /><br />If you want to appreciate this film, I suggest you do as I did.  It will help you understand why this version is so much better than what Americans saw when the film was originally released.  It will help you see the significance and recognize the symbolism of the actors Leone cast, the characters they played, the sets, the musical score, the cinematography, and the story.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|a total copy of command & conquer and just no fun except for graphics kinda cool don't get just trust me
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I use this to help me out to choose the days I go fishing ,very nice app for free would recomend
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It was fun to play and figure it out.  But there are no hints and I was stuck on the 4th room and just could not figure out how to get through that room.  So I had to give up on playing it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The idea and narrative structure were interesting, but the execution was shaky, particularly in the last segment, which I found rushed, unrealistic, and not compelling. It was a novel of characters that rang false and insincere to me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 9 year old loves this game! It's easy to play and understand. Just like having a real horse with out the cost :)
B00DM12ANO|5.0|Fresh. Not the same movie reheated. 2 or 3 sappy moments. Mostly cool! (good news: clean movie. no nudity/no foul language).
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|UNO and friends is a fun game based on the real life card game. You can play with friends and create your own games. You have these special coins so you can buy powerups for a round. Have fun and win in the game of UNO.!!!!!!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It was very exciting but seemed to be the same as the fellowship of the ring.  but fun to watch the characters.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Beautiful, epic, and thrilling from beginning to end. Exactly like the movie it is scoring. I love it so much .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Get's your mind working in creative ways. I love that. The games mental theme is similar to Witch's House :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing game! I love it! It's so much fun to play! I play it all the time!
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|This book is a great story about a kids life just before World War 1 begins.  He goes through so much in his life even before he becomes an adult and I can relate to this character. The boy has only one leg but he doesn't let it hold him back.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading historical fiction.
B0019TYQ38|3.0|Another version of the Austin question: to marry for money or for love.  Sense prevails though not in a rout. Very slow. Well written as always. Somewhat unusually, the movie is better: it provides a sense of time and place the book neglects.
0316247545|5.0|My only qualm with the book is the Title. What marketing genius at Hasbro pass up the opportunity to entitle it \\"The Elements of Harmony: A Reference\\".
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I really liked Beautiful Creatures so I was excited to read the next book in the series. However, after finishing this book I'm not sure I want to continue! I thought it was very slow and redundant. I felt at times when the author recapped on information that was established in the first book it was too unnecessary, since obviously most readers will already know the background information. I felt the whole book to be a pretty slow read, not much excitement took place. There are new characters introduced that I felt to be a little cliche, particularly Liv's character. It doesn't really make sense how she ends up in Gatlin, which is supposed to be a small town where everyone has lived in for generations.<br />  By the end of the book, I definitely found Lena to be quite annoying. She acts very selfishly and basically gives up on Ethan. The book starts to suggest that they aren't even going to be together, Ethan is just simply helping her find her destiny. I really liked their attraction in the first book, so that was disappointing in this sequel. Without spoiling anything, I have to say that the ending was kind of bogus. I guess it was necessary to create future books in the series, but it just goes against all of the rules set in place. I don't understand why Lena is so torn, maybe because she never narrates but I don't feel that I understand her choices at all and frankly don't really like her anymore. Also, it seemed kind of ridiculous when certain characters make it to the end setting, when basically the whole book is about the journey to this place that may not even exist, and then basically every character finds it.<br />  I definitely lost interest throughout reading. It grew a bit too immature for me when things didn't really add up. And like I mentioned earlier I was disappointed how the strong connection that brought Ethan and Lena together ceased to exist in this sequel. I understand Lena loved Macon, but she was supposed to love Ethan so much that she couldn't live without him, and then once she pays the price it seemed no longer worth it? I would suggest if you liked the first book to give this one a try, but I ended up disappointed and probably won't continue the series further.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is remarkable she is such a perfect act all alone... even my grandbaby 2 years old love her and sings her songs RUMORE HAS IT AND KNOW THE WORDS.
B0064MT1FI|5.0|This movie will take you through a lot of emotions. I will not give anything away, but the acting is outstanding and moving, the story is unpredictable and thought provoking. It is an e expected love story between two very different people from two very different worlds.<br /> Parental note: There are some very graphic nude scenes and some pretty graphic sex scenes. I would not let a child watch this.

Now I just say I am allergic to wheat and it saves a lot of time fielding questions from the listener. For family, I encourage them to get the book and read it in detail. It will help save their life and also be a guide to my grandchildren. Roy Chastain, retired Chemical Engr and MBA.7-21-13
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I cannot load Candy Crush Saga - which is what I thought I loaded with this thing.  I wanted Candy Crush Saga, not CCS Levels
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was out and didn't have my kindle with me , actually we were stopped in traffic for 3 hours. I downloaded the app and got to read more of my book. It is just the same as on the kindle and sync's with them easy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Picked this up for my Kindle Fire, and end e  up Dow loading for my wife's HD!  A cute game that is fun and easy. My kids will love it!
0679805273|5.0|I purchased this to start a gift for my son he will get in about 13 years. He just graduated Kindergarten and I am going to have his teachers sign it throughout his school years and then give it to him as a high school graduation gift! I am excited and already reading what his K teacher wrote in it makes me a little teary, can't imagine how I will be reading it when that HS Grad day comes around!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved being ahead of the TV version.  Loved the book, well the pc kindle version, fast, easy, could not be any easier to do or enjoy.  I am so enjoying my pc kindle version, I may not buy a  kindle,,, but only because I am a shut in.  If I was on my feet, I would have bought one so  it would have made your head swim.  I love kindle.....it' wonderful...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! Me and my cousin play it all the time. I am a major fan of this app, this game is soo freaking fun.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Bought this for my pc kindle, loved it, loved the ease of it, downloaded fast, very pleased.  Could not be happier.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|enjoy the game but for people who arent as quick need some way to make the time for each game longer!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I read this book because it considered Love a disease.... Had me hooked to read the next book immediately. ok
B00A757EFW|4.0|good game! please give more response to controls to make it more competitive. otherwise i really enjoy playing it thanks
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I was not impressed with the ending of the story... Of course it made perfect common since but was just disappointed...
B005COO1X6|5.0|Thing with Stephen King's books is that you know in the end all will be well. But still you always want to know, how it's going to end.<br /><br />I started Mile 81 on a Sunday morning, in the sun with an espresso and a cold glass of San Pellegrino sparkling water. And I kept reading and reading. Telling my wife the kids were hungry so maybe they should get breakfast and extending the kids' Xbox time to indefinite so they would let me read. When I was about 80% through, my mom called. I had my oldest son take care of that. &#34;Talk to your grandma.&#34; So I could finish the story.<br /><br />I guess, one could say that I was really into finding out how it would end.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|I ordered this book but did not have a fancy kindle to go with the video... it was alright though because it continued with the story line was curious on what the video's would of been like... This was a great book...
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I like this game. haven't been playing long but I look forward to growing my account. graphics are smooth. the battles are great.
B004GJNFHG|5.0|An increddibly well acted film with incredible dialogue that documents a very important and crucial event and time in both Irish and British political relations.
1600247245|4.0|This is an interesting story with a number of subplots.  The Harry Bosch character is always realistic, with many character flaws, but likable, too.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is fun and relaxing, but of course they want you to purchase things. I think that they should give you more treasure chests. All the good fun game you have to purchase things. I do love this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is yet another great one.  Each book gets better and more exciting.  Mr GREY is one neck of a guy
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini paints pictures with words!  A wonderful, informative look into peoples lives, their belief systems and their struggles to preserve life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun game; the only &#34;problem&#34; is that I go through all the game packs too quickly! One can replay them, though, so I can live with it...
B008YKGQR4|4.0|This app works much like the full Facebook on your computer.  Some games can't be played because they aren't compatible with tablet systems, but it is easy to maneuver through your posts, and type replies. I sometimes seem to miss the Like button and hit the Comment button., even though I think I'm right on top of it.
159463176X|5.0|I have read all his book. He is such a interesting writer and makes his characters come alive. I was sorry when I was done reading.
B00821OX98|4.0|Great summertime fill for the drought of decent tv programs this time of year. Love Noah Wylie and his character who as a history professor and father brings something original to the war against aliens.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|There are few movies that both of my boys will completely sit through.  My older boy, age 6, and younger boy, age 3 both really loved this.  My six year old has asked to watch it three days in a row.  That has never happened before.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|I learned a lot about Bob Marley in this beautifully written documentary. It was fantastic! I highly recommend it. Amazing.
B00003CXA6|5.0|One of the best movies and acting I have ever seen.  The movie captures the very personal and poignant side of this terrible event.
B009A87X80|4.0|Bought this after hearing her repeatedly on Pandora, and liking what I heard. The songs are very good, including the covers of some classics. Worth a try if you are not aware of her. Listen to the brief bits on AMZ or the longer bits on iTunes.
1401235425|5.0|What a great way to start off the new Batman series. I was skeptical about them doing a reboot, but it is perfect in every way! Cannot wait to see where they take this!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series!  We watched the first one, not expecting to like it much, but just to satisfy a friend who recommended it.  We were hooked!  It's so nice to not hear foul language and see bad behavior rewarded or expected.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|I looked forward to this movie, but was a bit disappointed.  It was typical British movie that wasn't always the easiest to understand.  The premise was a bit depressing.  We will all age and things won't be good, but this movie seemed to lean toward the negatives of aging instead of the aging with grace.  It took awhile to build the story and even if they had been lipsincing, I would have preferred to see the Quartet singing at the end instead of just hearing them in background.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|What a wonderful, magical book. So excited to read the next one. Darkness was everything I expected it to be and more.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|How perception and politics influence life, how a bad leader take the control of a country, how life can be terrible if leaders are not good or make mistakes, just 70 years ago, importance of liberty, importance of mutual support and connections among countries, very well written.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|loved this book! literally stayed up all night and finished it. augustus is just so cute and hazel is perfect for him.<3
B0059XTTW8|2.0|After listening to John Le Carre's opinions on this movie, I wonder if we watched the same movie. Maybe because he lived it he could see grand canyon deep into the characters, because I found them all pretty awful, and many of the actors I like. At the end of the movie I didn't care if any one of them lived or died.<br />The constant extremely slow panning showing the horrible sets and scenery was annoying and pointless.<br />They must have paid a bargain basement price for the wigs, hair pieces and hair coloring jobs. The orange hue on three main characters was very distracting and looked like the job of a very amateur hair stylist.<br />At least in this version, one doesn't need to read the book or a wiki synopsis to know what's going on or who all the characters are, but the characters are much richer developed in the version with Alec Guinness.<br />At the beginning of the movie after a botched undercover mission that Control (the leader) set up, Control in a meeting with other main characters, resigns and says Smiley's leaving with him. What?<br />William Hurt portrayed Control as a lunatic.<br />Gary Oldman says his lines in an incredibly robotic manner and tone as do all the other actors.<br />Both versions according to Le Carre show a realistic view of the espionage world. Neither certainly glamorizes the spy world as American movies and tv do. They also show the huge waste of taxpayers' money and no true accountability, because it's important, secret work, how can one expect accountability when it comes to safety, huh? Crazy.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|If you love lord of the rings; you will love this movie as well. Awesome. Dragons!!! I didn't get to watch the whole thing but from what I did see I liked, a lot. I didn't get a chance to finish it before the rental expired.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Truly loved this book as it is being told by the main character, the horse. Good for young and old. You will not be disappointed.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I love this movie because it has so many underlying meanings (as most Pixar movies do). One of the main themes I got from this movie is &#34;Don't let the past drag you down&#34;, &#34;Live in the now and enjoy it&#34;, &#34;Don't forget the past but learn how to let it go&#34;.... I j ust love this movie. I don't really like the part with the dogs in the planes. But I love it anyway. I feel like it is actually geared toward adults more than kids.
B005723JSQ|4.0|The concept was cute in a silly kind of way that only a true Sophie Kinsella fan would appreciate. I recommend reading this and you won't be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|wow I thought this game would be pathetic it just turned out to be the best game ever in the world
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator with a huge screen. It gets the job done, no complaints from me! You really can't go wrong with this app.
B008PUXMP2|5.0|all the favourites<br />her beautiful voice<br />a bargain<br />hurry buy this if you want to remember Amy<br />you won't regret it
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  It had enough of the lords of the rings to keep to the storyline, but enough new characters to re-energize the storyline.  Great job tying it together, cant wait for part 2!
B0088D3PYE|5.0|This is a great read, I recommend as a standalone or following on from The shadow of the wind. Go for it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|As soon as I got this game I could never put the game down, until my game died I was sad.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good Movie. My threshold for being good is that it must keep me entertained.  This movie did just that.  Not Oscar worthy, but worthy of your time to watch it.
0060936223|4.0|It's simple enough reading, I'll grant you that, but nowhere as important as they make it be. It makes one wonder how low the standards have fallen! Patti Smith is an interesting case of someone not content to rest in her status as rock singer, but wants to appear as important as Rimbaud.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book details the Zombie War in hindsight, as a reporter that goes through and talks to survivors about events that transpired and led up to the Zombie outbreak and subsequent war. It's well-written and definitely worth reading.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Contrary to some reviews, I found this to work great on Kindle Fire HD. Frees up both hard space and memory. The memory cleaner/task killer is especially helpful because the processor on kindle isn't that fast, especially if loaded up with music and apps, so this really helps it stay operable.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is everything you could want out of a replica screwdriver, but when installing the batteries, it is very easy to break the little black button on the inside, I was able to balance it back in place, but I know I will have to put up with it when I go to change the batteries again.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love most those passages on the teaching of symbols by Professor Langdon.<br /><br />It would be better if there is illustrations on what he said about the symbols, just simple drawings will make the passages more interesting.  As for those famous paintings or floor plans , it is a pity that they are not produced,  say by the front or end of the book.  Though it would raise the costs,  yet, who cares.  We'll still buy it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Any book Tina Fey would write is not exactly a hard sell for me, but this book was better than I would have hoped. I started laughing so hard reading it that my husband and I decided to just read it aloud so we could both enjoy it at once. Damn It was funny!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Great fun and really addictive, let down by it being another game where you have to spend money in game to get the full experience. So not really free!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pretty darn awesome game! Love it and it has great missions. It's very addictive as well. Definitely captures the despical me movie. I would recommend this game to anybody.
B001BANK32|5.0|Blows away the movie!! but you do picture Jack Nicholson as you read the book, and also Shelley Duvall!! great read!!
B003SI3URQ|5.0|I have to give it five stars since this is one of my favorite Disney movies.<br /><br />Yes, it has the same old plot that every other cartoon movie follows, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining.  The songs are catchy and I enjoy the comedy, with mythology in-jokes and pop culture references.<br /><br />With Woods as Hades was the true comic highlight of the film, his voice fit the animation and character perfectly.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is flawless. Worth $0.99. I would buy the expansion pack of you have a couple coins laying around
B000V7J82S|5.0|Bob Marley is a legend! This is a great record goes well with all of my other records. Thank you.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an interesting history of Tesla and his life. Some of his inventions that were lost or undeveloped would have likely changed the world. I enjoyed reading this book--quite simply written, but stuffed full of interesting facts.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|The beginning of the movie was sad when the children died. All in all, I thought the movie was cheesy and funny. I enjoyed it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Smart lawyers with interesting moral and legal dilemmas fill the screen with decent dialog for almost 44 minutes at a time.  Enjoy!
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|Classic independent film...a love story for sado's. Provocative without using sex scenes. Gives you a better understanding of the whole bdsm community for those of us who know nothing about it, I have a much deeper understanding of the book 50 shades of Grey..
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise, as crazy as his personal life comes across through the media, never fails to deliver when it comes to a good action flick.  Dependable action and drama all rolled into one rollicking movie.  I think I watched it twice...but then I enjoy movies like Anaconda. So keep that in mind.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm glued to the show and addicted to this drama. Can't wait to season 4. Sad to see the death of a great love affair, but also excited what this written is bringing to keep us addicted to the life of Downton Abbey.
B00AZMFO9U|4.0|The dialogue of elders is terrific. Maggie Smith worth seeing in any movie. We all get there in some fashion.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great action game -really cute graphics and keeps your attention. Would like a few more scenes to run through and the ability to get the Gru coins without having to pay!
B000008MLU|5.0|Everything about this album screams weird.  Frank was a true master.  From the albums cover to the very last track, this is a beautiful album.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This movie has about 30 seconds of cool in it.  The rest is just bad.  It's a shame, but it's the honest truth.  It's like they never made up their mind to commit to it being a prequel, sequel, spin-off or entirely new story.  Regardless, by the time they were done, it just never came together to make a good film period.  If you feel you need to see this, prepare to have your suspension of disbelief overtaxed and under appreciated.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Im a huge King Kong fan from way back.  I love this collection. It has some really neat bonus items including some really cool lobby cards.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|For the price, this was a very good value and meets my needs wonderfully.  My stylus fits right into the fold of the case to easy store.  It is light and easy to carry and store.
B0000028RR|5.0|Great album from a great band.  Rage Against The Machine is by far one of the best rock bands ever.  Just shut up and buy this CD
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Love the clocks password options and all the others like pages colors lined or not and being able to name him and each page. Love it !
6304711905|2.0|I know that this was a very popular movie and a lot of people like it, but I thought it was lousy.  Ive seen and I own much better westerns than this piece of crap.  I did not order this movie for myself
B004SBULWE|5.0|We have this app on each kindle, computer and all phones. The phones have the widget, and the kindle has the full free app. I have paid for different task killer and non work better.
B00C0NFMKI|3.0|Little darker, more grit compared to earlier stuff.  Half the album is good, the other half is slightly boring.  Over-all not a bad album.
B0081336FO|5.0|Fast-paced and intelligent, \\"Sherlock\\" will not disappoint! Every episode in both seasons 1 & 2 is excellent and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait for season 3 to become available.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have this on my phone and any time I am not doing anything I am trying to kill everyone on the planet so get this app it is total worth your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I read the reviews and I'm glad I bought this one. The arm comes with all the hardware for all types of uses. It came very well packed and easy to put together. I'm using a 20\\" hp display and it works great. Well worth the cost.
B009GX69RK|5.0|No matter what I recommend everyone gives this show a chance if you already have not. By far the funniest TV show I have ever watched. Amazing script, great acting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is soooooooooooooooooooooooo much fun I can't get off of it. This app is the best horse app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is great  , I love it ,it is what ii said it would be ,Im so happy with it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I totally enjoyed Season Three.  Can't wait for Season 4.  This was well worth the money.  Provided several hours of satisfied viewing.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I would recommend the app to all individuals who want to stay updated with latest info on a large scale of areas, including politics, financials, regional news, etc
B0073HNLB8|5.0|Hillarious. Was reading it everyday on the bus on my way to work and people kept looking at me because i burst out laughing every couple of minutes :)<br /><br />A real boost of positive energy and humor for depressing times :)
B004SDSSFY|4.0|helpful app, reduce the frustration of not being able to use your tablet as close to a computer as possible. makes word, excel and ppt files easy to edit and present.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Didn't really get if this was a children's story or a Sci-fi book. Was kind of strange and simplistic (and what's with all the weird remarks about jews throughout the book). Not one of my favorites...
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Saw this movie the other day, had high hopes for it and boy did it not disappoint. Best horror movie I've ever seen. James Wan knows how to direct. Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious, and now his best work yet, the conjuring, can't wait to see Insidious 2.
1476734941|3.0|I always say I won't buy another one, and I always do !! This one is a good one to read if you have never fasted before. More recipes, than info...but I fell for the &#34;Doctor Oz Show&#34; recommendation. Fast, easy read...but to life long dieters, fasters, or cleansers....a bit on the &#34;light&#34; side.<br />If you need a fast read, want results fast (no pun intended) results, this book does deliver.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book! I think this book is suitable and interesting for a wide range of audiences. I am a graduate student who does work with immortalized cell lines and I found it fascinating to understand some of the history behind these types of cells. I also thought it wasn't so technical that a general audience wouldn't understand. In fact, I think this would help people more fully realize some of the tricky ethical dilemmas in bio-related research. I would say this is a must read!
B005K17RU0|4.0|runs in background of my kindle. always updating to remain accurate. function s well and is easy to use. prefer over weather channel.
B009FZFONO|5.0|A must see from season one episode one, it will be hard to stop watching! Highly recommended.<br />Great to watch back to back episodes.
0070511136|4.0|I haven't had time to finish it. It came at a time when I've been in classes. What I've read so far is great...
B00007KWHG|5.0|Had this cd previously...lost it..so this was a replacement of some much loved music! Grew up with the 4 Seasons!
B00CSSMT6A|5.0|There are no words for perfection....Excellent purchase! It was a musical experience that was magically relived. I recommend it to all!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It was an OK movie; normal Nicholas Sparks fare.  Very predictable.  Could have appeared on the Hallmark Channel.  However, there are occasions when that can be good.  Thought Julianne Hough did a good job..
B008602KQI|5.0|i watched this twice, both times before reading the book. I love the costumes and world that the Capitol had. I thought it was rich and vibrant, and the culture and priority of the people were well laid out. All this was done through clever staging and lines. I wish there was as much insight into the rest of the districts.<br /><br />it was a good movie. don't expect too much of an adventure and too much drama - it is not an ambitious movie that aspires to more. it is a young adult's book turned movie. Expect the tempered middle. it's a great movie for anyone to enjoy.<br /><br />and p.s. i find that i love jennifer lawrence more as i watch her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!!!! You should download it!! Even dough it takes a few mins. to load &hellip; but other than it this game is awesome! !!!!!
B002SGYPS2|4.0|jim carrey is amazing. i enjoyed the premise of the movie, since i'm into the Utopian society theme. I thought the movie was a lighthearted take on that idea, but i didn't think the crux of the movie was exploited as much as it could have been --- why was truman so torn between his current city and the life beyond? what stake did the creator of the show have on Truman and the world he created?<br /><br />anyway, this all goes with the fact that it is a lighthearted comedy. i cherished the innocence that Truman had. i just wish i fell in love with the rest of the movie as much as i loved Truman.
B000GWE44U|2.0|It doesn't matter how many people rate this movie highly.  It doesn't matter how many times I view it. It's expertly shot, and well acted, but it's not a good movie because it's not a particularly good story nor screen play.  It's interesting, and mildly creepy, but I find it rather plodding, having little heart and void of worthwhile sentiment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game  it's a mix of jet pack joy ride and temple run but it it surprisingly really fun fun you should defiantly get this game and you love it by a cool kid and it free I love the minimise hit each other's I hat this thing
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazingly awesome can't wait to see what happens next. I love it so much my new favorite for sure!!! Happy reader
B0042T8ERQ|4.0|Watch this again, and again, and again.  Hayden is great, and the movie is engaging to watch.  I bought it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  I wish there were more episodes per season though. 7-9 a season is not enough. But overall, an excellent series.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|It is a very, very pleasant game. I have had other types of this game/I'm sure a lot of ppl have. This is one of the best looking. Thats just me....great job...
B004YKSXYW|4.0|Great overview of history written clearly and concisely.  My only wish is that there was a little more reflection on the events.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|IT's a decent story with plenty of action!<br /><br />It was a nice way to spend a Friday evening with the family.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Great book! This book give a lot of ideas about how to organize IT in organization. From service (bad service) dpt. to value creator.<br />Must read for every IT leader.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kyle keeps it real even when not telling wartime stories. It's nice to read such book when it sounds real and solid.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Certainly is nice to use!  Whiskey Beach was a great book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I want to read Killing Kennedy again.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Chris Pine and Denzel Washington make a great duo. This is how to make a great movie full of drama and suspense without being over-the-top with CGI effects. This movie is a must see.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|I rented this for an easy-to-watch movie night, choosing it for the array of good actors, in a seemingly bad film. It was a much worse film than I even imagined, painful to keep watching. Characters were probably very fun to portray,the believability of the story needs a serious base, which Bruce Willis is brilliant at usually, but he's next to Mary Louise Parkers silliness most of the film and that wears off on him...
B002BWP49M|4.0|Breaking Dawn from the Twilight Series was a good two part ending. However, part 1 & 2 seem a bit drawn out. I think they could have made one great movie out of the two. I hope this doesn't become the going trend at the box office.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Saw this in theatres a few times then on video several times.<br />Well done movie, great acting, directing, script, love it love it.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I started playing and couldn't stop! I could play for hours. Definitely an app I would recommend to anyone. Especially strategy lovers.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love this app.  Not too thrilled with the changes but you have to roll with the punches.  I can't find any allergy information which is so important this time of year.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I love the strokes but this is the bet album yet. It was delivered quick, the case had one crack in it but it was brand new
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and would definitely recommend it! Not like the original, but almost a combo if Oz and Star Wars... Wizard!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great summer read! Each story gets better from the last. Good mystery and suspense, thought provoking, a love story, murder mystery and science fiction all wrapped into a great read
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|One of the most jaw dropping books I have read in a long time! The author draws you in from page 1 to the final page. Could not put it down! Can't wait for the movie next year!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book.  Katniss goes on another adventure with Peeta.  Lots of unexpected turns come their way.  Will the pair of star crossed lovers make it thru this crazy situation?
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Considering the somewhat recent announcement of MGS 5: The Phantom Pain, this is probably the best thing you can get if you're wanting to try the Metal Gear Solid games.All games work perfectly and I'm having so much fun with them.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Excellent read, a real light bulb moment and makes sense about how our bodies should be nourished and treated in this day and age.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a cool game.. a really like this game. ithink I shouulx really play this game. playing this game will help you with horses. in real life
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game can be played by really anybody. It is fun and very great.  It a lot like subway surfer. Also you do many challenges so you can become the top minion.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|This is one of the best historical novels. Its length is a challenge - a good one. The research is astounding. It's a good re-read.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I dont like the 10 dollar charge to keep playing after the first few missions but its still fun so far .... I'll get my money's worth

0061122416|5.0|My son has to read this for his pre-AP class over the summer and was dreading it, but has come to enjoy the story and is nearly finished.  Very good story that takes place in past.  This story has great morals and is a realistic, believable story with a great historical setting.

B0069UV0LS|1.0|Why make movies like this?  I watched this with an open mind & sadly watched it until the end.  It is one of those movies that make you feel unclean.  I don't see the redeeming value of portraying these pathetic creatures.  You don't have to shove it in my face how awful life can be --  I see it in the news everyday.  Winner at Sundance film festival, really??  People surprise me all the time.  Yes the acting was good, cinematography good blah blah blah.  The first five minutes did hit me in the gut as I am sure it was meant to but after that I could feel no sympathy for the main character at all.  So watch at your own risk if you like to see animals getting hurt, women getting hurt, and children getting hurt.  As for me, I need to go take a shower and I don't even think that will help.

B00319ECC4|4.0|Fear Factory's seventh full-length record, 2010's \\"Mechanize,\\" is their first in well over six years to feature original riff-master Dino Cazares. So while original drummer (and co-founder) Raymond Herrera, sat this effort out (he was replaced by Strapping Young Lad skins god Gene Hoglan), there is really no denying the fact that this album marks a return-to-form for the band. So how fitting it is, then, for \\"Mechanize\\" to come across sounding like a continuation of F.F.'s debut, 1992's \\"Soul Of The New Machine.\\" What this means is this record actually has more in common with extreme metal (i.e. death metal, grindcore, and thrash) than it does with anything else (i.e. industrial and/or groove metal). So that means that, yes, without beating around the bush at all, this reviewer will come right out and say it: This is easily one of the heaviest, angriest, and most aggressive and straight-forwardly brutal things that Burton C. Bell and the boys have ever recorded.<br /><br />The ripping opening title track plays like a face-ripping, head-tearing onslaught where Bell's visceral, commanding bellows lead the charge over an uncompromising deluge of blistering blast beats and thrashy, pulverizing guitars. The tune might begin on a fairly prototypical Fear Factory-esque note, with creepy, robotic-sounding sound effects, sure; but it is almost not worth mentioning because it soon builds to become the blinding deathgrind onslaught that it is. And then, following \\"Industrial Discipline,\\" a more involved venture that practically screams \\"vintage Fear Factory,\\" with its thundering drums interlocking with fiery guitar chugging while Bell's harmonic vocals echo and cascade on top, comes \\"Fear Campaign.\\" A creepy little introductory sample/clip not withstanding, this number is mostly another furious, no-holds-barred, industrial-tinged death-thrash/grind attack that evokes the band's \\"Demanufacture\\"-to-\\"Archetype.\\" It is indeed one truly unhinged blast of brutality that is long on staccato guitar riffing, mean vocals (including occasional spoken word bits), and breakneck, machine-gun-fast drum fills. And there is even a decent little guitar solo sprinkled into the mix, here, too.<br /><br />But it is after that that Fear Factory again delve into territory that evokes their \\"Obsolete\\"-era -- at least briefly. \\"Powershifter\\" is a catchy industrial thrasher that marries catchy, stop-start rhythms with crunchy guitar licks and impeccable, motoring double-time drumming. The number is also of note for its vocal patterns, as it finds some nearly monstrous death metal bellowing trading off with nicely clean vocals in the choruses, thus making them really, really memorable. \\"Christploitation,\\" then, continues in this thrashy death metal-sounding vein, as it dives head-first into an almost pure thrash ferocity of buzzsaw picking and pummeling drum blasts. The end result comes across sounding not unlike early Sepultura and Slayer mixed with Pantera, Nailbomb, Dying Fetus, and Malevolent Creation. And then, following \\"Oxidizer,\\" a terrifically catchy tune that, with its hefty, memorable riffs, and catchy, lumbering rhythms, is sure to get mosh pits everywhere working overtime, comes another really thrashing excursion in \\"Controlled Demolition.\\" This piece is filled with memorable, air-guitar-able guitar parts, including punching, Meshuggah-reminiscent licks, Slayer-inspired leads, and hooky, stop-start/staccato chugging.<br /><br />\\"Designing The Enemy,\\" however, serves as the record's first real curveball, as its soaring clean vocals and only sparse use of heavy power chords create a very dreamy, ambient, and even-more-so industrial music-like atmosphere. And \\"Metallic Division\\" is also almost 100% pure, Prong-like industrial metal. It does not take the listener long to get the gist of this song, as it is a spooky, dark, and futuristic-sounding soundscape where cool backing sound effects are laid elegantly over a bed of repetitively churning, lumbering,and head-bangable guitar and bass riffs. But immediately after \\"Metallic Division\\" grinds to the close, Fear Factory are heard again revving up the engines ten-fold, with \\"Final Exit,\\" which dives headlong into an onslaught of blistering, machine gun riffage and pounding drums that get in your face and smack it around really well.<br /><br />The above-noted two experimental songs (\\"Designing The Enemy\\" and \\"Metallic Division\\") not withstanding, the signs of innovation heard throughout \\"Mechanize\\" are minimal. As such, the album can be deemed only a partial success. But even so, it does make for an innumerable amount of immensely enjoyable, satisfying, and pulse-pounding listening sessions, so it can be easily recommended to both fans and newcomers alike.and head-bangable guitar and bass riffs.

B008602KQI|1.0|This has got to be the most disgusting exploitation of the stupidity of the American public. Hello out there! This is a movie where CHILDREN kill children until all are dead except the predictable heroine (who herself kills three children) and her tagalong boyfriend. I don't care what contrived \\"deep meaning\\" there is to this story, it is still a story where children kill other children for the entertainment of the movie-going audience. Disgusting! Is there any wonder we have children killing children in schools across America. Dean Kamen, founder of the US high school robotics competitions, once addressed the national championship games at Disneyworld. He said to this effect: \\"There are more than six thousand high school students and their engineer mentors here today participating in these engineering games. There is NOT ONE, NOT A SINGLE member of the press covering this event. They are all at Columbine High School.\\" [For those of you too young to know the connection, two students murdered 12 other classmates and a teacher.]Then he said something I will never forget: \\"YOU GET WHAT YOU CELEBRATE.\\" You get what you celebrate. I use this now so often to help understand otherwise inexplicable behavior. How are so many evidently intelligent people hoodwinked by this disgraceful, manipulative, predictable, and shallow movie? Can no one see past the slick packaging to what this movie, the production of this movie, celebrates?

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Aslan's claim that Jesus was a kind of pro to-Zealot is a thesis that has long been discredited by New Testament scholars. That he was a political revolutionary of any kind is nonsense. The historical Jesus was undoubtedly the most apolitical of major religious figures. Aslan wishes to be seen as sensational but offers nothing new to the tired and tiresome  Jesus as Zealot argument. He is also appallingly ignorant of contemporary Jesus scholarship. That Jesus was a \\"Jew\\" is, of course, undeniable. But what kind of Jew? In my view as a historian, Jesus perceived his \\"kingdom\\" as \\"not of this world\\".  His ministry was directed towards  encouraging listeners to to recognize that Yahweh (God) \\"loved\\" them unconditionally. \\"Jews\\"must  therefore  \\"love\\" Yahweh without the intercession of intermediaries or institutions. Jesus was anti-Temple, not anti-Roman.

B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works on a now-abandoned Earth as a security guy / repairman who lives on a platform in the sky with his co-worker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough).  Every day he hops in his little space ship and repairs the security droids that patrol the earth below, ensuring that the massive natural resources extractors continue to function and send those resources back to Titan, where all of Earth's inhabitants now live.  This is a difficult movie to review as there are several twists and turns and I don't want to ruin it for you -- so I won't really tell you who Morgan Freeman is or what he does.  Jack has a bunch of flashbacks to a pre-war Earth and even has some sort of idyllic Yosemite-like park to escape to, complete with a cabin furnished with an old stereo, turntable, and classic records including Creedence Clearwater Revival and... Asia.  However this isn't a music review.<br /><br />I've never been much of a Tom Cruise fan, but in many ways he is very well-suited to this role (i.e. someone who has had his brain wiped and doesn't really know what's going on).  [Sorry if that sounds rude, not my intention]  His rather stiff acting style and inability to really create characters with warmth or depth actually works here.<br /><br />The running time is 126 minutes but I swear it felt like 180.  There are definitely moments where you want to hit fast-forward but given that each scene reveals another piece of the puzzle you don't really want to do that.  I think the film would have benefited from a little more editing.<br /><br />Overall I'd probably say 3.5 out of 5 stars... the fact that I'm still thinking about it and decided to write this review is a good sign.  It's one of those movies like the Sixth Sense where you might want to go back and view it again once you know the whole story.<br /><br />Special effects are very good, and the landscapes of a post-apocalyptic earth are pretty striking.  Fortunately there's not the requisite destroyed Statue of Liberty however you do get a glimpse of her in one of the chase scenes.  And she's not in such good shape.  Jack's apartment in the sky is super cool, as his his space ship.  If Frank Lloyd Wright designed houses in the sky, this might be it.<br /><br />Would I \\"buy\\" this movie and add to my collection?  Probably not.  But a good rainy day film, and one that will leave you thinking.of Liberty however you do get a glimpse of her in one of the chase scenes.  And she's not in such good shape.

The lead singers trade off parts with ease to create an almost ethereal quality to the music.  It almost puts me in a trance to listen to it...it's not relaxing exactly, but it definitely gets me in a sedate state of mind.

B00A4OALL0|5.0|I'll choose this space to have a say about the wonderful work of this band over that last dozen plus years. First a word to those who long for \\"Speak No Evil\\" style playing-if that has disappointed listeners over these years, then you don't know Wayne Shorter. None of us really do, but all I can tell you is of my first impression when when I first this band. \\"He's picking up right where he left off.\\" And where he left off was what he was doing just before Weather Report, his three probably least liked albums-\\"Super Nova\\", \\"The Odyssey Of Iska\\", and \\"Moto Grosso Feio\\". Don't have 'em? You might want to get them because they are great! Even the first two Weather Report albums will set you up for this music better than anything else.<br /><br />Not here's the \\"but\\"-being that most of the music on this band's releases have been from live recordings (which is best for any group that performs group improvisation such as this), some of the performances can be quite long. And on all of the live records, \\"Footprints Live\\", \\"Beyond The Sound Barrier\\", and this one, \\"Without a Net\\", there are performances that have obviously been edited. You can hear fade outs and instances where you come in on the middle of a performance. Granted, a concert where you are trying to decipher when a particular composition has started or not can be a challenge, but on \\"Without A Net\\" there is one glaring example where this is not a good thing-and there is a comparison you can make and decide for yourself. Here, Plaza Real is a seven minute edited performance from an appearance at Showville, Bari in Jazz, on 10/13/2011. Go to YouTube and look for the entire 12 minute performance, begun with whistling and Danilo Perez using a plastic water bottle on the piano and other sound effects. They start with music from what we know to be the beginning of the composition, and it puts in all into a context that makes it all the more thrilling. This one they never should have cut. But download the video, I urge you!<br /><br />This only makes me wonder what we missed from the other edited performances-wouldn't it have been better to release double CD sets of these performances? And where's the DVDs? John McLaughlin, Pat Metheny, and others release a DVD behind every recording and subsequent tour. Hopefully Blue Note, with their reputation, will see the value in doing just that with Wayne Shorter in the future. Let's hope. And let's hope this band lasts another ten years, the master's health willing....

0399159347|4.0|Set in Australia as her other books have been, The Husband's Secret shares the stories of three women. The three stories appear unconnected at first, but soon lives intersect and the story concludes in an interesting and discussion-worthy way.<br /><br />Cecilia is busy raising her children, happily married, and the type of woman that other ladies are intimidated by.  She is always on time, always dressed well, and appears to have it all together.  She is a bit worried about her marriage as she and her husband seem to have lost the passion they once had.  When she comes across a sealed envelope with a letter her husband wrote inside she wants to open it, but doesn't per her husband's request.  But when her husband cuts his business trip three days short to come home and Cecilia discovers him going through the attic in the middle of the night to find the letter, she can no longer honor his wishes. Cecilia must know what her husband is hiding.<br /><br />Tess and her husband Will and cousin, Felicity, are just starting their own business.  The three of them have been inseparable, the best of friends.  When Tess finds out that her husband and Felicity have fallen in love, she takes her son, Liam, and moves in with her mother who is recovering from a broken ankle. While there Tess meets up with an ex-boyfriend who hasn't ever forgotten her.<br /><br />Rachel Crowley is the secretary of the school that Cecilia's children attend, which is also the school that Liam attends when he and his mother move in with his grandmother. Despite the fact that decades have passed, Rachel is forever known as the woman whose daughter was murdered.  Although Rachel has also lost her husband, it is the death of her daughter that still consumes her thoughts, as does finding her daughter's killer.<br /><br />The secret in this novel has many consequences and affects everyone in some way.  Although I believe honesty is the best policy, this story definitely brings that thought into question.I'm not a great guesser and never seem to be able to figure out murder mysteries when I read them, but I did determine what Jean-Paul's secret was before I ever read it.  However, that didn't detract from my enjoyment of The Husband's Secret.  There are great discussion points in this novel, and Moriarty had different characters affected by the secret, that I still wasn't sure what everyone's response would be until the novel's end.<br /><br />I'm loving Liane Moriarty a little more with each book I read of hers - a great woman's fiction author.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought this series was a trilogy?  I was very disappointed in the abrupt ending of this book.  It almost seems like Sylvia had written so many pages and just ended it.  I think there was more substance in this one than in the second book and will probably read the next two installments as I am invested in the characters.  At least it appears that Gideon and Eva have become more trusting and less confrontational.

I can't believe I never had even heard of it before? McConaughey plays a very different type of character than I have seen in the past. As opposed to a cheeky ladies man, he plays a very deep and dynamic character that you have zero trouble sympathizing with. I have never been more impressed by him. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of suspenseful thrillers. I wouldn't say this is a courtroom drama however.

1475143389|5.0|Like many others, my work requires me spending countless hours each day in front of the computer. This happened after I graduated from college about 4 years ago. I went from walking, or biking to school to driving to work on a daily basis. Everything, including my lifestyle, revolved around work for e.g. driving, eating fast food, not working out, spending countless hours watching TV and YouTube, drinking on a regular basis, now also with co-workers and not just friends. I put on nearly 40 pounds of fat in just a matter of months (8 to be precise). Then, I came across the magical world of diets.<br /><br />Dieting phase: First, the Atkins diet: this phase lasted for a month ended up losing about 10 pounds of fat and muscle. After a month, my body was craving carbohydrates like never before; ended up putting 15 pounds of fat in a month. Second, I stumbled on a documentary on Netflix called Big, Fat and Nearly Dead and viola, I bought an expensive juicer and motivated myself to get on a raw food juice diet. This phase lasted for, excruciatingly long, 15 days. Ended up losing 15 pounds in 15 days; and put on 20 in the following month after quitting.<br /><br />Work out phases: Finally, after many unsuccessful attempts of dieting I decided its time to start working out. Started hitting the weights hard. Would work out on a daily basis (5 days/week) for 2 and half hours which included 30 mins of cardio and the rest lifting weights. This phase lasted for about 2 months, in which I managed to lose nearly 10 pounds of fat with significant strength gains but very little gains in size. However, 2 1/2 hours of daily workouts took a toll on my body. I started having injuries which led to frequent skipping of workouts. Later, it took a toll on my mind and will power. I dreaded working out for long hours and again started skipping. Finally, after a 2 week long vacation I never went back to the gym. :( Started gaining weight again. However, this time at a much faster rate.<br /><br />Finally, I decided I should probably give a more scientific approach to getting in shape. Stumbled upon BLS on Amazon.com and bought it after reading some of the reviews. I have never been happier. Mike, has an uncanny ability to support his exercises/plans through peer reviewed articles. The best part about BLS is that I end up spending only about 45 minutes in the gym, less than anyone else working out. And, I have seen significant improvement in not only my strength gains but also size gains. When I started the BLS workout and diet plan I weighed in at 210 pounds (I am 5'9\\", male, 25 years). Now, three months later, I weigh 185.2 pounds. I lost 24.8 pounds of fat in just a matter of 3 months. I absolutely love my diet plan, which involves a lot of meat and really look forward to hitting the gym every evening. I am more confident, love how I look in the mirror, and enjoy everyday of my life. I cannot thank Mike enough. The only complain (sarcasm, obviously) I have is that I went from 38 inches waist to 34 inches in 3 months. I had to lose all my pants and buy new ones. Sheeesh!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|In formatting my book, I found this book clear and simple.  That's what you want in a book like this.  I did end up with a small problem, so it was deficient in some way, but I'm not sure exactly what way.  I ended up with one chapter having smaller type than the rest.  Also, my two jpegs ended up flush left and indented rather than centered, which is how they started out.<br /><br />Other than that, though, the formatting went just fine.  Knowing how difficult it is to write clear instructions, I can give this book four stars.

They are precise to your answers. Everyone has a Guardian Angel that God has appointed to them; so why not contact them through these cards and ask for the guidance or whatever question you may have. I Guarantee you will be guided with an answer. Do these cards either alone or with a best friend/family member; just make sure your mind is clear and your Heart is truly into it. Blessed Be & Enjoy
0689878451|5.0|I AM A SECOND GRADE TEACHER AND I READ THIS TO MY CLASS. THE KIDS LOVED IT AND ASKED FOR IT TO BE READ AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT'S A REALLY CUTE, TRUE STORY. TWO OF MY CLASSROOM PARENTS HAD AN ISSUE WITH IT BEING READ IN CLASS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS A STORY ABOUT TWO MALE PENGUINS HATCHING AN EGG. IT WON A LOT OF AWARDS, BUT IT SEND UP RED FLAGS TO THE CONSERVATIVE FOLKS.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This is a great Blu Ray movie but the 3D makes it even better.  The colors are eye candy, the soundtrack is great and the story may have you in tears. Would recommend this movie to anyone's movie collection.

B006LSZECO|2.0|From the beginning Gone Girl had  my interest even though I attempted to skip over all the F-words.  However, as I got further into the book, the language deteriorated from bad to WORSE. Totally unnecessary in my opinion! Call me a prude, but I don't need to be filling my mind with this kind of filth.  Maybe not all of this author's books contain this type of language, but I'll never know.  An intriguing plot, too bad the language was X-rated!

B000000OE7|1.0|How can such a great rock band like Queen put out such a dismal pop album like this?  This album is not good when you put aside the sentimentalities of it being Freddie's last.  The album has songs previously released on other solo albums, and newer songs that I just don't see how they can even be categorized as \\"rock\\".  This is sentimental pop gibberish that should not hold the name Queen on the title anymore than Mr. Bad Guy. Other than a few moments where the band shows why they were at one point one heck of a rock band (very, very few moments you can count on one had), the album is flat and boring and better suited for some aging pop artist like George Michael (in which case I probably could have given the album 3 stars).  I've heard Brian say that he feels it was a fitting ending to Freddie's career, and can agree with that in the sense that it feels more like a Freddie Mercury solo album and follows along the very poppish vein that he had pursued, but as a Queen album, it fails badly. There is none of what made Queen great (probably less so than in even Hot Space) They should have stopped at Innuendo (I think the song Innuendo is one of their greatest all-time songs), and in particular with The Show Must Go On (another great song).  I wanted Made In Heaven to be good.  I really did, but I can't express my disappointment that this is how Queen went out.  I've tried on several occasion to listen to the album with a more open mind, but find that I just can't.  This album is made-to-order for an easy-listening radio station and nothing more.  Perhaps a fitting tribute to Freddie, but a very unfitting tribute to Queen.

B0023SDPS6|4.0|I had come across this TV series title several times on Netflix before actually taking the time to watch it. Needless to say, I found it hard not to like Robert Taylor's portrayal of Walt Longmire. After having watched a season-plus of episodes, I decided I needed to read the books, to see what was missing. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />As a big fan of Robert B. Parker's series of Spenser, this quickly jumped into a series I wanted to read. Though it does, obviously, start with book one mirroring one of the episodes from the television series, there are enough differences I feel like I am not reading a novelization. Johnson does well in bringing what would normally appear mundane for a small-time sheriff into the a mystery that requires interaction with other characters as eccentric as the sheriff in order to solve this crime of murder. With a nice twist I was not expecting at the end, Johnson has shown he has the feel of a great western-mystery writer.
B003RUX2VE|5.0|This is one of the underrated movies that just hits me where I live - good acting, quick story, good development (as much as you can get in a movie of this genre)....wish there were more like this one!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a awesome game one of the best apps out there you can shoot guns and reload it is awesome but it needs more guns like mp40 m911911 and a lot more sides like Russian British Italian Japanese but it's a great game
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is the story of an orphan who grows up and is given various jobs to do based on his perceived aptitude for things not so easy for other people (kidnapping, transcribing radio transmissions).  He is good at what he does, and through a series of coincidences, ends up with access to some of the most powerful people.<br /><br />While we are experiencing his life, we are also experiencing the narrative that goes on inside his head which is really interesting.  He believes he was the favorite of the orphan master (from his orphanage) because he was secretly the orphan master's son, and this favoritism was manifested in the orphan master being extraordinarily harsh with him and never letting him be adopted.  Because he has a name characteristic of orphans (one of the heroes of the revolution) people remark throughout his life that he must have been an orphan, and he is always correcting them.  It's interesting to see how he experiences lust, love, and doubt through the eyes of someone who not only grew up in North Korea, but has been deprived of even the most basic life experiences.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Although I haven't finished it, I've read enough of Connelly's books to know that this is one of his best. The investigation & forensics in it are captivating!  It seems to me that many authors that I enjoy wrote better novels with their 1st 10 books. I don't know why that it, but maybe it's because the publisher pressures them for an annual quota & the rush to finish takes away from the story.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I heard about this book through the New York Times and on a podcast, and I was intrigued.  It is narrated by the girl who was brought up as the twin sister of a chimpanzee for the first five years of her life.  The style and organization of the book is an attempt to reflect the psychology of someone with that experience.  I enjoyed it, but it took me about three weeks to read, so it wasn't a page-turner.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Injoyed the insight into British aristocracy. The interactions of  people was intregring. Interest was held throughout  the story. Looking forward to coming season.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have loved every season and every episode in the Bones series.  In this season it is nice to see the couple interacting with their baby and each other.  Bones is starting to FEEL things now and become more human and more gentle.  What a cute and wonderful couple they are.  Love it, love it, love it.  I will buy season Eight for sure.
0062082353|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it and is enjoying it very much.  If it's interesting enough to keep him reading, it's a good book!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Not much to say except that there is a despicable yet lovable villain with the most hilarious kind on entourage.  Jason Segel is just as funny and there are a couple of key 'laugh out loud' moments.
B007P7UF06|5.0|Loved it when it was first performed on Broadway, and have seen it in all of its renditions, both on-stage and off. Richard Harris was always on-point despite his reputation as a hard drinking partier. This musical never ceases to entertain. Saw Robert Goulet in 1960 as Lancelot, and many years later as the aging King Arthur in a touring company. Enjoyed talking with him about his passion for sailing and his boat. Gracious as always, and still with a voice that could rattle the rafters. RIP Bob.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This has been the book series I have been waiting for since I read the sword of truth chronicles. It was exciting invigorating and investing. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Ireally like this app, I now use it on my phone and my tablet, just need the American developers to learn how to SPELL !!
B003TQ50V6|4.0|Great Stars!! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I think the end could have been better. Worth Seeing!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I L-O-V-E this app:) its really cool and super fun! My little brother and sister made me get this app cuz they had it on their kindles and wanted me to play with them. Its so fun that I play it without them lol:) But yeah I love it!&lt;3 and I'm 15 haha! And you kinda learn stuff about the sea and stuff and that's cool cuz it makes me feel smart!
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I just love the Minis. I think the original is better. But how often is it not. This is still a great movie to see. Don't see it as a remake and it will be a better movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|They took a simple, clean app and destroyed it. I used to love this app but if they do not fix this buggy unresponsive mess I will happily deleate it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The last level on the newest stage is so hard that it can very close to rage quit, bui still like the entire game.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|The movie was great escapism fare.  Actors and story line were good, very enjoyable film.  I'm not a science fiction buff, but I did enjoy this one.
B009NYU1CQ|1.0|I only watched this for about five minutes b/f I knew that it wasn't worth my time. In my opinion is isn't Bullock or Afflick's best piece of work.
B000VUDSH6|2.0|It had subtitles and the movies was just not enjoyable.  I do like Jackie Chan, but, this was not a good movie.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Purchased as a gift for someone who enjoys Downton Abbey.  They were very excited to watch all three seasons, especially season 1.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This game takes forever to load! Also, the tab at the bottom of the screen that takes you home doesn't show up so it is hard to get out of the game! Take my advice and don't get this app!!!
B0054SMID0|5.0|It show that kept you guessing who did it.  I could relate with legal system frustration. Mathew as always was good looking and great.
B0027MJU00|1.0|-100 stars.  This book could have been written in 10 pages.  Jump to the last 10% of the book and skim through it as fast as you can to pick up a few meaningful sentences and that's all you need.  The characters have no depth and the book is full of descriptive blubbering that is unnecessary and adds nothing to the story.  Hated it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game for the horse lover! I enjoy this game as much as the kids do! The only thing I don't care for is that the trot and gallop gaits are not accurate. I do some of these things with my own horse.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|good movie with a good story and twist you don't see coming. Would recommended to anyone tired of special effects.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie before it was in High Definition, and it is a true timeless favorite of mine. My only objection is the occasional usage three common four letter words ( S, H, D ), which are prevalent in today's society, but not attractive in family oriented movies.  Even so, it is like watching a children sized action comedy version of  &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; etc. .
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've had this game for years on my laptop and now on my kindle fire and I absolutely love it. It's the best bingo there is out there. No problems with it ever and the items are cheap.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies and when my DVD started to skip I figured it was time to upgrade and get the Blu-Ray set.  The packaging is wonderful and quality of the movie is beyond comparison.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is fan of Blade Runner or to someone who is looking for a wonderfully made Sci-Fi movie.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I watch Memphis Belle every single time it's on television.  Finally, I've bought it.  I like this movie because it's very human, but doesn't drag down.  It's a war film, but not too sad.  The music for this is outstanding.  I read everything about WW2, and realize this is not intended to be too bloody, realistic, etc.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Good entertainment.  Really good price.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|The music is lovely and the Bocelli touch is perfect. I particularly enjoyed his Italian rendition of September Morn. Nicely done.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I think this is the strongest installment in the series.  I've never cared so much about characters and how their lives turn out after the story is finished.  Fitz feels like a real person that I can relate to.  Even though he grows in his proficiency in the Skill he does not become an unstopable superman.  You are keenly aware of his limitations as well as his strengths.  This is one of the better fantasy books I've read in a long time
080508990X|4.0|It is a cute book but a bit too small.  The illustrations are nice and it is good for a small child.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|We not only bought this movie for the grand kids but also for us old folks, the parents also really enjoy this old classic
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Our grandsons enjoyed this but I think we enjoyed it as much as the did. We loved the music and the vibrant colors.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|This movie is an unexpected hit.  There are numerous twists to the plot.  There is a lot of tension and action.  The acting is superb. The characters are believable--not cardboard dummies.  You WILL relate to the characters and feel the tension when they are in rough spots.<br /><br />The people giving this movie low reviews are the ones with little patience, who do not listen to dialogue, do not appreciate pacing, and are conditioned by movies like Transformers to expect nonstop, mindless action.  This is a movie for viewers who appreciate character-driven stories with a lot of violence.<br /><br />This movie is a story well-told.  It is never slow and boring.  In fact, I found it to be an excellent intertwining of a realistic love story and an action/thriller with a bit of mystery thrown in.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie that is not totally predictable, actually spends a bit of time on characterization, and includes a lot of fun action, watch it.  It might even be worth a buy.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|good music...good songs and if you like music then this is a good choice.. enjoy listening to music...have a great day
B00499QUK2|5.0|We admired the way the writers integrated Sherlock's foibles into the modern age!  Sherlock certainly would prefer to text - efficient and succinct.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Loved watching this movie, lots of action and extremely good acting on the part of the stars.  Will probably watch it again.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I just had to buy it because of all the things you can do and how much fun it was...this is one of my fav. games ever...!  :)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The purpose of reading a book of fiction, for me, is transporting me completely to another time and place, where I can see the people and experience their emotions and take part in their experiences.  This book does that for me and more.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I agree with many of Ms Jay's points though don't care to take it as far as she has.  A quick and easy read to re-inspire yourself!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I enjoyed a quick game of this Solitaire quite often, but suddenly it stopped working.  I wonder if I need to remove it and re-install.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Way too simple and predictable. Some will like it as there is a lot of action. I love action movies but didn't love this one.
B001TODO72|4.0|Fantastic! A brutally honest memoir in the form of a graphic novel that explores the writer's relationship with her father growing up through the lens of discovering after he died that he was gay. The illustration is wonderful and does not detract from, rather it adds to the story being told. The only challenge some readers may find (myself included) is that much of the story is told by way of relationship to various novels that the father and daughter shared, many of which I have not read and some of which I have never even heard of. This is not too difficult to work through because Bechdel does an excellent job of conveying the reason for using the comparison and summarizing the novel through her telling. I would recommend this for anyone that is a fan of memoirs (I typically am not), for those that who like non-fiction graphic novels, or anyone who enjoys a deeply felt story. It is worth noting as most reviewers here and national critics alike have pointed out that Bechdel's style is both hyper-controlled and incredibly intimate at the same time.
B00B8BR1YS|3.0|I was interested to see the movie and have been for a long time.  My anticipation was sated by the movie, but I wouldn't watch it again.  It was an interesting take on the story of Shakespeare land the creation of the play Romeo and Juliet, but I didn't find it compelling.
B004TBWFAO|4.0|Fantastic entree into Virginia Woolf. I really enjoyed the style of writing that she employed and the way the book was split into three unique parts without losing the thread employed all of the way through. This is one of those books that even though it was written a century ago and there are a few references that are lost on the modern reader, it could have been penned today. There are so many layers to it and understanding some of the author's life story certainly helps in peeling them back, but I would guess it would be unnecessary for full enjoyment. Highly recommended for those that like books with many layers that though complex can be as simple as you want.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|gave it to my niece many years ago when she was pregnant.  She loved and played it for her baby before and after birth.  Now I gave it to my granddaughter and granddaughter-in-law who are now pregnant.  I hope they love it just as much.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I really liked the previous Predator movies.  I don't like this one nearly as much as those two, but comparing it to the original which is a classic.  It has good action and is worth watching IMO
B008N1LL42|3.0|Pretty much like Battle Los Angeles was an advertisement for the US Marines. Lots of cheesy gimmicky hoorah American Hero moments that made the movie feel cheap. I like my military movies when they're actually done like military styled movies and not a recruitment advertisement of things that don't even happen in the Armed forces. I think Battle Los Angeles was the worst of these type of films. This was watchable because it had more alien interaction. I didn't realize that this was a movie about the board game battleship until someone pointed that out to me. The entire time I kept wondering how the aliens came all the way from such a distant planet but had such primitive weapons technology. It didn't seem to fit with what you'd expect from advanced life forms. Aside from the movie feeling like a cheap military commercial I didn't dislike the characters. There were some good ones like the Marine that lost his legs and... uh well I can't remember anyone else but him, I think he should have been the star of the movie.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|No text, just video of babies growing up their first two years in four locations around the world.  Really cute, light music and fun clips of the babies, their family's day to day interactions.  Really well done and the time flies.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is awesome if you have ever played the card game years ago and you miss it then this is the game to get you back into it! It's very addictive and lots of fun and the story is alright but it's mostly about the awesome gameplay and strategy you get to experience!!!! So I recommend to buy it it's worth it!!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book is a Great read, but too similar to the Kite runner, otherwise I would have rated it a five.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|An easy read, you never know where it is going and keeps you willing the protagonists on. A great story of love and sacrifice.
B0001ARCFA|1.0|Paid a decent amount for these headphones about 2 years ago. Didn't use them much when I first bought them, but I began using them at work. Within a month, the left speaker stopped working. Three weeks later, the other one stopped working. All I'm doing is listening to quiet music on my iPod so I have no idea why the headphones failed so horribly.
B000FC0ZAI|3.0|I bought this thinking it was a different book with the same name. Its a nice book though and still worth a read.

B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I like Arthur Clark and have so for many years. Childhoods End, once started is hard to put down. The story stirs the imagination with intrigue and  an unusual propophcy for humankind. Recommend for all Si-Fi readers and Clark fans. This story really stirs the imagination with description of places and characters, the reader gets a most vivid picture in their minds. You are there!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|rates a 5 star for . Well done and worth the rent. Would not recommend this for the little ones just adults. A good take on the children's story.

0615782043|5.0|I don't normally read and review poetry, but after meeting the author last year and again this year I had to. Passion and confidence as you can see in his name if you want to know what his message is see his brand, \\"The Greatest Poet Alive\\"<br /><br />His work truly tells the stories of his heart, what he feels, can feel and how his mind portrays images of relationships. Good poetry is generally rich with imagery. The reader can actually feel or hear the authors words, and to this reviewer that is a job well done. All of the poems in this book, my first read by the G.P.A was done in excellent taste and imagery.<br /><br />The G.P.A understands erotica more than many in this same genre. His poetry involves the five senses, sound, touch, sight, smell and taste. I totally enjoy the way he handles figurative language; saying one thing while suggesting another. (read She, Her and Me or even Sextet) Experience this author words but try to catch him LIVE and in person its finger snapping jood!!! (not good)
B005UG542S|5.0|a good take on the story we grew up on. Not for really small children. Worth the rent for all adults.
0321544080|5.0|This book has a little bit of everything and has plenty of insight from one of the world's best, Joe McNally. I love the pages where it showed you exactly what equipment and what went in to creating that specific shot. This helps when you're feeling blank and need a little bit of a creativity boost just by flipping the pages, looking at some of those, then giving it a shot yourself. Mind you, this won't make you an amazing photographer overnight, but it's definitely one of the books that an aspiring photographer MUST have and will really help the way you think when it comes to taking shots. I always said, don't always aim for the PERFECT shot and stress yourself to death with that thought, it'll come on its own while you're enjoying what you're doing. This book further enables you to think of just that, enjoy, think outside the box, and snap away.
B00B04NJLW|1.0|The excitement I felt about watching this may why the reality seemed like such a steep fall off a cliff. I like to believe I am a fan of both horror and short film collections, especially the combination i.e., Master of Horror. However, this one in particular misses the mark. There is so much opportunity for this to have been an excellent anthology of creativity and expression, but I think that the directors ran too far away with their attempts at artistic expression and put the movie itself to death.<br /><br />While there were a few exceptions (A for Apocalypse, Q for Quack [although a mock comedy],S for Speed, etc.) The majority followed a pattern of attempts at originality and shock factor. Sometimes there is a reason why things are not generally used or depicted in film. Child rape doesn't make your film Avant-Garde. It makes it tasteless and disgusting. Is it a real thing? Yes. Do we need to see it? No. I think the final kill count for how many people where killed by toilets or poop was at 5. It almost seemed like some of these directors took this as a opportunity to get paid making something that gets them off. On the other hand a majority of directors tried too hard to be edgy and missed the mark. The movie became more of a guessing game of how unrelated the title would be from what was depicted. A great example was a film where a girl, being against her will is killed with a lethal injection. This was titled I for Ingrown. I'm sure the director would argue his case as to how its related, but most of the directors tried to be clever and artistic instead of giving it the appropriate title such as I for Injection.<br /><br />Overall, this was a huge letdown. It had such potential and was such a unique idea. Next time maybe they should solicit entries and choose the most appropriate. I guess you don't stand out when you do something as cliché as V for Vampire or W for werewolf, but it would have been a nice change of pace from the indecent and convoluted storylines thrown about in here.
B000005J56|4.0|What can you say....they are the best.  This music seemed alittle slow to me.  It is their earlier stuff and vintage Buena Vista.
1781162646|3.0|I have never read any works by Stephen King, but I was under the impression that he was well known as a thriller writer. It was a lovely story however I was expecting a little more action, which did not surface until the very end.
B001JRB16U|4.0|Created in a series of novels writen by P.L. Travers between 1934 and 1952, Mary Poppins was originally described as an eccentric battle ax with magical powers--and Travers was in no great rush to let her popular character go into the movies.  When she finally agreed, she was horrified with the result, despising virtually everything about the movie.  She was, however, in a distinct minority.  Produced by Walt Disney Studios, MARY POPPINS was the number one box office hit of 1965, receiving spectacular reviews and picking up an Academy Award for star Julie Andrews in the process.<br /><br />The plot is a mixture of the first four Travers novels with a bit trimmed here and bit added there and a number of tweaks along the way.  Set about 1910, the story concerns the Banks family.  Father George (David Tomlinson) is preoccupied with his job at the bank; mother Winifred (Glynis Johns) is preoccupied with the suffragette movement.  As such, they tend to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), leaving them with nannies that the children run ragged.  When the movie begins, the latest nanny (none other than Elsa Lanchester) resigns in a huff--and the next day, under significantly mysterious circumstances, a new nanny applies for the post: Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews.)  Together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke) she takes the children on a series of extraordinary adventures than range from jumping into chalk drawings to having tea while floating in the air to wild dancing with chimney sweeps.  In the process, she reunites the somewhat fractured family.<br /><br />The story is extremely episodic, but it is well done, extremely whimsical, and the script is often unexpectedly clever.  The music holds everything together.  Everyone is sure to have their own favorite song, with \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\\" and \\"Let's Go Fly A Kite\\" extremely popular.  My own favorite in the score is the delicate, beautifully performed \\"Feed the Birds.\\"  The film also has a number of cameos, including Hermione Bradley, Reta Shaw, Ed Wynn, Jane Darwell, Reginald Owen, and the aforementioned Elsa Lanchester, all of them charming.  The major cast is also quite good, and if Dick Van Dyke's accident seems to come and go in strange ways, the chemistry between him and Julie Andrews more than makes up for it.  The movie is very specifically a \\"sound stage\\" movie, and the special effects are distinctly of the 1960s, but no less charming for that.  If the movie has a flaw, it is that it seems a little too long.<br /><br />There are several different DVDs of MARY POPPINS, so the bonuses vary, but from what I can tell most editions will have at least a commentary track and a \\"pop up trivia\\" feature.  In any case, the sound and film elements are excellent.  Is this a great movie?  Well ... perhaps, perhaps not.  But I absolutely defy anyone to watch it without smiling.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerformed \\"Feed the Birds.\\"  The film also has a number of cameos, including Hermione Bradley, Reta Shaw, Ed Wynn, Jane Darwell, Reginald Owen, and the aforementioned Elsa Lanchester, all of them charming.

B000HAB4KS|5.0|The Matrix is too good for an amateur, brief review.  It manages to be a cultural icon, a spiritual launch-point, and one very cool action-adventure movie.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Great movies of Arnold ,thank you for this very nice action movies,,,,,,,....I will tell a friend about this fim again
0767903374|2.0|This is well-designed book, although the order of the topics probably could start out less INTENSE. It felt like being thrown into the deep end, emotionally, not something as a HSP I enjoy. It made me feel very reluctant to continue with the tasks.<br /><br />I have done a lot of work  on myself and really don't want to be INTENSEly focusing on all the dark and creepy corners anymore. Been there, done that.<br /><br />I was hoping that it would have more practical strategies for coping with being in the world as a sensitive person - environmental, social, travelling.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this book through amazon Marketplace and didn't spend lots of money on it to be repeated led into the horrors of my childhood and adolescence like some kind of torture.<br />Caveat Emptor.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Readying about Red II, and want to see it.  Thought I should first see the first edition.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was a wonderful movie that gave some real insight into bipolar mental illness and the problems people face even with mild cases of the disease.  The script is wonderful and the acting was such that the movie worked in all areas.  I had not heard of the film when it was nominated for various Oscars, but now I see why it was nominated.  It mixes a serious topic with human in such a way that the viewer is given a lot to think about as one looks at those in our families and society.  This is a problem that is rampant and needs to be addressed.  I can't think of a better way to address it.  No pressure, just a gentle message that we all need to get.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've been hearing about the show on Twitter for years. I don't typically watch network television, but I am so glad that I took a chance.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for making all of the seasons available! This is my new guilty pleasure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing. I've played up until midnight playing. I've already got the baby minion. there are in app. purchases but I don't care. I highly recemmend it.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is beautifully done. The music, the graphics, the gameplay are all fabulous. I love logic puzzles and this suits my cravings for challenges quite well.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|The kids always love this movie. It's funny, charming, and tells a heartwarming tale. I too love this movie very much.
B0034G4P1W|4.0|My son absolutely loves this movie. We loved it too . . . until the 20 or 30th reviewing but even then we still get a chuckle now and then.<br /><br />It's a fun story that is over the top but that's okay because it's supposed to be over the top. This is a rollicking fun film that your kids will love and adults will enjoy it too.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sookie Stackhouse  finds it easy to turn down the request of former barmaid Arlene when she wants her job back at Merlotte’s. After all, Arlene tried to have Sookie killed. But her relationship with Eric Northman is not so clearcut. He and his vampires are keeping their distance…and a cold silence. And when Sookie learns the reason why, she is devastated.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Love the seek and hide puzzles this is a unique one. Has a story to it only wish the characters would talk for themselves.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great season. It blew my mind and I love the fact that it is filmed similar to white collar. Sweet
193700788X|5.0|While i'm going to miss the adventures of Sookie I have to admit I was very pleased with the way Ms Harris wrapped us up in the last story, tied up all the loose ends and left our heroine facing a bright future....
B00005EG2E|4.0|This CD is one that I keep in my car for road trips...love the music. I bought it used and it plays great!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good brain exercise for the whole family... Of course, someone has to lead the others in the right side..<br />Fun for all...
B005GFPZYK|1.0|It is a sad commentary about a young man who has chosen to go to war for his country. After a extensive program of selection to become a Navy Seal, Chris Kyle becomes an elite sniper. Whilst one applauds the success of the soldier to this point, it becomes apparent that the business of 'killing' becomes just that. A business. As one continues reads through the archives of this man's career, it is plain to see that his chosen job as a glorified murderer, has begun to consume all that the young man once may have been. That old saying, 'wars will continue for as long as there are enough men in this world who love them', is certainly shown to be true here.<br />Whilst the reality is 'kill or be killed' is sad to think that a young man's dream becomes such an obsession as to see him return and return to get his 'fix' of killing. This is aptly expressed in the delight and pride he shows in his writing of this sad chronicle. The number of young men around the world who clog our psychiatric clinics and hospitals as a consequence of involvement in warfare, I think is a sad indictment on the political warmongers of our time. This is not a book that I would recommend with any sense of propriety.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|My first  book by this author.  I really enjoyed and plan on reading many more.  Any suggestions from you folks out there?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It didn't take long to read and it was very entertaining. I would definitely recommend this to others! Movie is pretty good too and is similar to the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book and book series. Couldn't stop reading. I believe it would have been better if it was in Christians point of view instead of Anastasia's but beggars can't be choosers.
B002X1JKG4|5.0|Always a great watch! One of those movies that you want to watch again right after it finishes. 5 stars!
0425263924|5.0|This book was finished in a weekend, as I could not put it down. Excellent!!Waiting for the next!! Hope she is working on another.
0824835921|3.0|After a 4th (or maybe even 5th I've lost count) attempt of using this book I've come to re-review this book. I have to say I think the method sounds great. Remembering small pieces and then putting those together to remember more complex kanji. That said I just simply do not like this book. There's an annoying habit of starting the chapters off saying something to the affect \\"If you have trouble with X you didn't listen when I told you to do Y.\\" which just gets tiresome in my opinion. Also one idea that seems like it'd be more important is the idea that the stories should be something that entertains your mind, allowing you to recall it easier. He says you need to disgust, enchant, tease, etc... you brain so that the stories become more permanent, but then proceeds to give stories so plane and forgettable that it goes straight out the window. Another issue I have with his book is that if there's a kanji that acts as a primitive, he'll give the primitive a meaning different from the kanji. I for one would think that using the actual kanji meaning whenever possible would be the best course of action, as that would mean you'd get exposure to the meaning every time it's used in another kanji. The last issue (or at least the last I'll make a point of mentioning) I have is that the book teaches you the meaning of kanji in English. You need to buy another book to go through and learn the meaning, but why do this? Kanji are pretty well useless for learning Japanese if you don't know how to read them. You can recognize them all day in English but if you're trying to read some Japanese then it'll break your mindset of thinking in Japanese. You need to buy his second, and from what the reviews say less effective, book to finally learn the meanings to them. All in all this left me feeling like I learned nothing to advance my understanding even having learned ~500 kanji. I just can't bring myself to finish this book, it is not the book for me, though the method seems sound.<br /><br />Short Version: The method is good, but I simply just don't care for this book. I'd recommend someone considering this first find a section of it online to see if it's really for them (you can find the book for free online, or at least I did after I'd already bought it). If you're good enough at self motivation maybe you could use the method with a list of joyo kanji and make your own primitives for learning, that way you can learn the readings along with the meanings and writing.
B00D7JQJFG|5.0|This shows the concept art and explains the mood and feelings that the artists were trying to convey.  It also walks through certain design and story elements to the characters and the game.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Super fun and distracting! It gets a little repetitive after a while but if you have a bit of time to kill I definitely suggest it
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I LOVE this movie, and am so glad I purchased the Blue Ray version to get all of the awesome special effects!
B006YC74E8|1.0|Not many effects and none of them look really good. Looks kinda cheap too. Wouldn't recommend anyone to use it.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|Game of Thrones is what &#34;everyone&#34; is watching. I gave it a try. I will probably try one more episode, but so far I seem to be missing what all the whoop is about. It looks like a video game, and it is brutally awful. OK, I know life was like that in the middle ages, but it's not even historical. Where is the valueCan someone  please edify?
B00A81NFAS|5.0|These two work so well together it was tense, funny and one of the best movies I've seen in a while. If you like drama, and comedy, you'll love this.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Was somehow reminded of this movie a few days ago and ordered it on a whim (and why not...at less than 10 bucks for a bluray and free 2day shipping). It was just as epic as I remembered. Seriously, this movie is pure excellence... The cast is great, particularly Alan Rickman as the frustrated Shakespearean actor who's best gig was a cheesy sci-fi show.<br />A note on quality...There are some deleted scenes and special effects, but this has all the trademarks of a 'hey lets throw some featurettes on a bluray and release it!' quality job that you'd find in a Walmart bargain bin. I can't remember how much language was in the original, but this version seems to be edited, almost as if this is the 'for tv' version; at certain points you can see the characters mouthing, well, 'different' words than you hear, and it made it seem a bit cheap. In the end I don't really care because it's a good movie at a good price. Had I paid any more I might be a bit more upset about the presentation, but heck...it's not even 10 bucks. People pay more for...well, lots of things. Like meals from McDonalds. And we all know those only bring sadness in the end, no matter what they're called. Don't buy sadness, Galaxy Quest is way better!
0061950726|5.0|Great novel for the teens as well as adults. It tells the similarities and yet differences between an older woman and a young girl. I am interest in looking at other novels by this author. This book will not disappoint you.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This was a good movie with a scarey topic. If you like bad seed you will like this movie as well
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|Love this cd, but the songs do sound the same as his previous cd's.  Still love his song, though!! :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice fun game. Good graphics. Lots of activities. Cute horses. Challenging but not too hard. Fun game except for picking up the poop.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoying solving the puzzles and hidden object screens. Great graphics! My one complaint would be the price of the full app. Free app only lets you do part of the story. Kind of expensive.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I've always loved the challenge of Angry Birds, and now, with Angry Birds Friends, I can compete with my Facebook friends, which adds another level of challenge to the mix :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was fabulous!<br />Have read the book multiple times, have enjoyed all three books and can't wait for book four :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great graphics! really fun game. very addictive my seven year old loves this game. it is easy enough for her to navigate!_
B008G3N71W|1.0|If you are just interested in sex scenes this is for you.  There is no relationship between characters.  You don't care about anyone and it is hard to believe anyone would jump into an abusive controlling relationship that fast and have so much unsafe crazy sex.  Yuck!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Poor plot line and its like the writers were grasping at straws to keep the Die Hard movies going. Definitely not the best Bruce Willis movie.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie but it was nowhere to be found in public libraries or video stores (?).  I'm glad I ordered it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great book! Lots of action and a bit of romance. Hard to put it down! Would definitely recommend this book!
0783226063|5.0|Well worth if you like SicFi!  It is still not dated in appearance and plot! Something you will want to watch over and over! A real cult classic!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was my least favorite of the trilogy.  I think they called each other Mr. and Mrs. Grey like 40,000 times.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The show is great can not wait for season four.  Loved the couples of episodes with Grandmama, some American sass.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow!  This has been an amazing trilogy.  By far...one of the best I've ever read.  They continue the whole way through to escalate and bring the reader further and further into the world and even in the end, which is quite depressing...you don't want the series to end.<br /><br />I came into The Hunger Games trilogy already knowing what the authors true intentions were from reading blogs and reviews.  I believe her overall intention was to show what war and violence does to a child and how it can wreak their lives forever.  Yes, it's also about taking down an evil government, but the overall point was what the violence did to Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  Each one of these characters was effected in a certain way, different from the other.  Being that I'm in the military and seen a lot, I've seen each of these in my friends and brothers/sisters in arms.  The unfortunate thing is, with evil always present in this world, fighting and war will never end, until God comes back to make everything right.<br /><br />Mackingjay was excellent.  It went a completely different direction than the other two, but still entertaining.  Through all three books Katniss is being hit over and over again with horrible things...but this book beats the tar out of her and the last blow to her is overwhelming.  I wouldn't let my children read these books until they are closer to 18.  They are ver violent and the true meaning behind this book and the others won't be grasped by such a young developing mind.  I can't go on without giving spoilers away so I'll end with this...Suzanne Collins, by writing this book series you've made yourself a target by our government.  I pray for your safety.  This book series will change lives and hopefully ignite a fire within the citizens one day to make right the wrongs in Washington.  A commend you for your bravery and excellent writing skills.  I will be buying these books now in hardback and putting them in my library to pass along through time.  Thank you and keep up the good work.nd keep up the good work.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie is great. It has a show off attitude to it! Might not be war accurate, but it shows a completely different type of soldier instead of just gun blazing.
B00AYB0VO0|5.0|I think Scream is a great, great movie - one of the classic scary movies of our time. Scared the crap out of me the first time I watched it and still scares me to this day. Murder costume is definitely one to remember - kids still dress up like that from time to time and it gives me the chills! Ha!
B00AFEY354|5.0|This Movie has so many emotions shown in it that just pulls you in. In some way you will be able to relate to at least on character in the film. It's different than most films out there.
B0094N2PES|4.0|Not as good as the first, but still scary and twisting. Neve Campbell does a great job again as Sydney Prescott and I love Liev Scrieber being more in the scenes. Opening scene with Jada Pinkett is a good opening scene too.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I bought one of these mostly because I didn't like the default mini USB charger. I'm not sure if it charges any faster than the regular charger because I usually charge mine overnight. It's a lot easier to plug in and use than the regular charger and I like that it comes off easily if the cable gets pulled or snagged rather than being stuck in the tablet and damaging it. One word of advice: don't charge with the pogo cable while there is a usb otg plugged in too. It'll look like it's charging but it's not. Take out the flash drive before charging the tablet with the pogo cable.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|not really crazy about it, after a while you get bored of the game. just ok to waste some time with
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great read. Even having watched the show first, it's an engaging read, without making me feel cheated by either the show or the books. Both are very well done.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|the movie is horrible. there are a lot of plot holes and the story is overall dumb. don't buy the dvd.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Love these movies.  Blu-ray is always nice and know the age of the movie, I didnt expect much as far as quality.  I just wanted it on BD vice DVD.  Get it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|this cable worked very well to help me get my pictures from my computer and put them on my kindle fire.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Nice storyline and a good length to the game.  Items in the search scenes were a little easy to find but still one of the better G5 games overall.  Only few back is the $5 to buy the full game.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Never ending choices, you`ll never get bored. The choices are never ending.<br />I am always trying to beat my score, but don`t quite understand how some get so low scores as listed here.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Story was lacking in a few areas. Other than that, I would say it is worth look. Go giants! Yup.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|When I first heard they were doing this... I rolled my eyes.  Then... I saw a trailer and was interested.  Rarely do I go to theaters to see a movie, nowadays tickets are about the same as BluRays anyways.  So, I can wait... and I'm glad I did.  Watching this on a 240hz, 1080p, 60&#34; HDTV... was freakin' awesome.  Wow.  Sam Raimi did an amazing job and the casting was good too.  Even went as far as paying tribute to the original by filming Kansas in Black and White, in the old style box tv screen as well.  So, don't adjust your screen settings when the movie starts... But, wow, what a great job they did.  Very entertaining the whole way through.  Knowing it's a Sam Raimi movie... you'll be waiting for the Bruce Campbell cameo... it's a good one too.  This movie will be a classic, easily.
1476715904|5.0|This was an amazing book that will make you laugh and cry and everything in between. The strength Will and Lake display is truly something to be admired and emulated.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This text was an easy read, interesting information about the true meaning of what particular flowers say about the giver.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|very slow game, for the mentally challenged? what is the purpose of such a prolonged slow game?wheres the instructions ?
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have to say the previous app was easier to use-trying hard to adapt to the changes. Sorry WC I liked the old app better.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|\\"Boring!\\" is how my son described this game. It's a good thing that it was free. He didn't like it at all and asked me to remove it from the Kindle.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows and this season has so many changing character dynamics and conflicts. If you haven't watched this show before purchase season 1, it's well worth your time.
B005KWL2IW|4.0|Typical Anthrax album.  Glad the original singer is back.  His voice is so right for Anthrax.  I enjoy the album.
B009EBL9HE|5.0|apparently it needs like 20 words... it was good. interesting. I liked how each episode is like hour and 40 minutes long. It was almost like watching a trilogy every season. I loved the character development, especially the bond b/w holmes and watson. cool.
B005WFUZTE|5.0|David is a very talented song writer and guitarist.  His band is very tight and sounds very strong.  Go Megadeth!
0062082353|4.0|Very descriptive of events and Kyle's war experiences. This is good for history, and as an example of the right training of the Seals and other military men.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|Adele has a very strong and powerful voice.  Her song selections are just right for her style and vocal range!
B00007E8O5|4.0|its odd not hearing Layne sing but Jerry did a great CD. There was a few that i kinda did not like but out of 25, it was only a few. Reminds me of AIC.... Miss Layne.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|It reminds me of the old Black Sabbath of the 70's.  However, the drumming is much better on this CD.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|I like the way they integrated the transformer story line into real history, The special effects (visual and sonic) were impactful. Well done.
B007ZMD14I|5.0|Slash is one of the best guitarist of this generation.  I'm glad that he survived the GNR days.  Kennedy is very good.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|I like me some Bruce Willis but it is about as clever as an 80's sitcom. I'll still see Red 2 when it is available for rental, though. Good movies are hard to come by these days.
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Vinnie Paul is by far the best drummer in Bonzo.  The band is very tight and sounds great.  wish Dimebag was around!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is better than the first. I like that you cam unlock new people so you do not have to play with a boy if your a girl. I think the mine is way cooler
B005K2KCPG|5.0|Sammy and Michael what can I say!  they made Van Halen and they make Chickenfoot as well.  Keep it up boys!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|For those saying it isn't conductive ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE it is a levels guide for candy crush and not the game this dev didn't make candy crush so they can only put up this GUIDE. Please read the whole title before complaining about how it isn't candy crush because it isn't supposed to be.
0446569895|5.0|obviously Ozzy had a lot of people assisting him in writing this book.  His memory could not be that good with all the abuse.  loved the book!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My friend has this on her iPod and she said I had to get it. So first I got it on my phone and was perfect then I got it on my kindle fire. I love this app! Recommended by me!!!
B0018AM1YY|4.0|Not a big fan of young, but I really enjoy this CD.  Covers most of the songs I do like by him.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|A little long winded, and boring at times. Would like to see Cornwell get back to a little more exciting stories.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great reading, keeps you wondering what's next. Kind of addicting. Not recommended for everyone, even though the story can be graphic, the underlining themes are real and heartwarming
B006BOT28U|4.0|The novel format helps drive the business concepts contained. While some of the ideas seem a bit simplistic the book is good at portraying different constraints and how to get around them in approaching the end goal.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game with great graphics! Needs some better character and horse breed options. Simple to use and operate. My daughter loves it.
1781162646|5.0|Wow!  Goes back to some of Stephen King's earlier writings.  Was thoroughly enjoyable with a great pace and good story.  Short and compact, but exciting and chilling as well.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Fantastic action by some fine actors.  It moves with wild action scenes and funny lines as only Bruce and his fellow actors<br /><br />can do.  I am sure that the actors had as much fun doing this movie as I did watching it.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I had trouble with the device charging my Kindle... It only worked for a short while. Best beware because the chargers seem not to work well unless they are purchased and made by Amazon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second in series of three;  loaded easily and like the story.  one two three four five six seven eight nine ..... I hate having to have a certain number of words to comment on a product --  keeps me from ordering from that vendor again.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love how you can find different rooms in some levels.Also its tricky and I love a tricky game :)!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I was really looking forward to this album and it didn't disappoint. I am quite picky when it comes to what I put into my ears for tunes and this album made them feel good. Real music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season had a lot of surprises.  The hardest part about watching it is knowing that Season 4 hasn't started yet!  It's a great show.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Just look at the movie reviews for this one.  Toy Story is a timeless and classic franchise which will set the standard for kids movies for many years to come.
0671449028|3.0|I’m still looking...  I love some of her other books, but the story in this book just makes no sense. I don’t often to read it to my son.

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My teenager and I loved this movie. It was funny. We hope a sequel will come out.<br />This movie has some awesome butt-kick scenes. It is a great mix of action, drama, comedy, and it has an amazing moral to it. I totally recommend this to everyone, young and old alike.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I guarantee you will love this app! Its kind of like subway surfurs but better. The minions are halariously adorable and the game brings them to life. I have so much fun playing minion rush. You should definatly get it! (:
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a good little game to pass the long hours of summer. It is your classic match 3 or more app, but the interesting artwork background and 4-5 modes of play keep your interest more than those others. Recommend to anyone trying to keep boredom at bay.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I'm making myself complete the trilogy just because I want to see what happens to the characters. So, there you have it.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I enjoy watching my grandson as he attempts to play this game  I hope we can find more when he tires of this one
B001NLKT60|3.0|The language and tortures were a bit over the top to my liking. But I'll finish reading them all just because I do want to see what happens to the character.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great comic book. I really don't read comic books but i watched the tv show and tried the comics. There is some swearing. I have to say the tv show and the comics are pretty spot on for most of it.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I know there are people out there who must enjoy the torture of others but it really got to be too much for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved the logic of this game.  It has the feel of an adventure point and click sans storyline(think I preferred that actually).  It does feel short  but that's because it's just so fun. Did have to download twice due to some unspecified error.
B003AVMUS6|5.0|The item arrived just when it was supposed to. My grandson loves it and I'm sure it will survive for more little ones to enjoy it because it is so well made.
0007466064|5.0|ALL these books are superbly written. GRRM's writing is evocative and often so real it's disturbing the images he brings to mind.
B003B02O0A|5.0|MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE!! A MUST! I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH AND I BELIEVE IT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY I PAID FOR IT!
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|We were coming home from upstate New York and as we neared the city for some reason every connecting road to Long Island had a major accident and was closed. I was trying to figure out a way home with my google navigator and my phone battery went dead, so my husband said to use his phone with Waze. What fun, or at least what fun while stuck in traffic. It showed everything we might possibly want or need to know and as we approached each traffic obstacle, it was a good stress reliever to click that it was still there, knowing everyone behind me was also going to be miserable.(I know that's nasty, but it was hot and I wasn't in a good mood, sorry) It was very accurate, easy to use, and got us home. I put it on my phone as soon as we arrived.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Exciting and moves fast. Liked the acting and was more interesting because its true story. Still didnt think it was best picture for 2012 and wouldnt see it twice like I tend to do on other movies I really like. Worth seeing but wont be the best movie you see from the 2012 produced inventory.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Was OK  not as good as some of his CD's but it is Christmas so I will only listen to it once a year.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This show delivers to sci-fi fantactics like every other awesome sci-fi show. Yea it doesn't take place in space or anything but if you like Battlerstar, Doctor who or Dollhouse you'll love this show. The writers/producers/directors know how to appeal to their fan base with the cast, anytime the story gets too &#34;General Hospital&#34; the Arrow gets thrown into a fight scene. It balances action and drama just like all other nerd shows do so well. DC fans will love this Oliver Queen, a good mix of Pre and post New 52 Green Arrow makes for an awesome TV show.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|The app was exactly what it said it would be, but I found its size, over 1 GB, to be excessive for the medium.  I wanted it for my kindle fire, but it just takes too much space to make it worthwhile.  A smaller, more streamlined app would be much more welcome.  As it is, it really seems more designed for a PC or laptop, not a tablet.
B008602KQI|5.0|i love the movie!  Happy it was available on amazon prime.  Cant wait or the second movie to come out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A superb game with the weekly challenges making it better and making it more challenging. A lot like temple run.
B000OW77UU|4.0|This was an excellent movie dealing with real life and how someone continued to push himself against all odds to improve his and his son's life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Oh my gosh I tots love this game.  It's amazing ! I am never bored and I've never had so much fun !
B009329ZF2|5.0|There is something like finding buried treasure when you find an obvious B grade SF film that transcends its slot and becomes not only a fun story but a well done one.  One of the often broken but cardinal rules of SF is to never break continuity and to take the premise of your world seriously.  They did both brilliantly.  Not only did they consult with the navy (see the special interviews and background stories on filming) they actually tried to stay true to their established premise throughout.  Though there were elements of &#34;top gun&#34; acting, it was still a very fun and ultimately rewarding story, which is about as good as a movie truly gets (even insight or social commentary has to have a good story to deliver its message).  I was surprised by how much I enjoy the film and my vet wife loved it too (a commentary itself that it appeals to both).  Its price is low and reward is high, so I hope you enjoy it too. :)
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|OK I have 2 things 2 say fix 2 things when I'm running I glance of one I get steady then the say thing happens to another zombie I get caught and when I got 2 distance 7831 I only got 507 coins on other games I earn like  more then 1000 so please fix that in a new update
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fabulous, glorious dramatic story with primo English stars--you can;'t do better if you like English drama series than Downton Abbey. Beats even Downstairs Upstairs.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a great game never has forced closed or froze. This game is amazing and you could try it and it's free
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Salander is  great character, love that she is so smart.  Blomkvist nice guy that all the women love..  Sean Connery should play him.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I was surprised at who Gossip Girl is.  Liked the ending but wanted<br />to see more of the former stars and not just cameo appearance<br />Hoping for a Gossip Girl movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and the colors are great.  I enjoy playing every day. It recently failed but I just reinstalled and now it works fine.
B0013GLE4Q|4.0|I like this cd, Avril is a great artist. I bought this cd for one of the songs in particular. I want to use it in a slideshow I am making for my mom's memorial service. I have not been able to attach it and use it. Music wise I rate it with 4 stars, but I am not happy that I spent $10 and I am unable to put the song I want on the slideshow.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I absolutely loved this game at first but once it had me update it I lost all the original puzzles that I wasn't done with and the whole thing became glitchy. The &quot;original&quot; puzzles were so easy to scroll through but after the update it kept moving pieces that I didn't touch and they did not slide across the screen very well. I got so frustrated with it that I ended up uninstalling it but you know that didn't work either; it said that it did not uninstall successfully. Go figure!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|If I wanted the religions of the world that would be something else but as far as I can see I would do better to just put in the url of a tv station and watch that and save the money
B00C061I3K|5.0|Not like other Daft Punk albums which is why I enjoyed RAM so much. If you want vintage Daft Punk go buy their first few albums.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Great beat.  Love the music and vocals.  Loved the addition of additional vocals.  I would buy more of this type of music.
1936608898|5.0|This book is very interesting & has changed my way of eating. It has helped explain how & why food does certain things in your body in additoin to the hormonal responses. Great read & I love my Whole30!
0500516766|2.0|Not as interesting as it appeared.  I thought it might be a more elemental view of how things go together.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really liked the story.  Get that out of the way.<br /><br />It is a short story.  I bought the kindle version, don't know what the hardcopy looks like but if it is more than an inch thick the font must be enormous.  I give it four stars because i feel like the author/publisher/whoever actually priced this, is on a cash grab.  If you can wait, i'd wait for the price to drop or go borrow it.  American Gods was a great book and an actual novel.  This is a great short story being sold as a novel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I got HOOKED on Downton Abbey! We watched it from season 1 to the end of season 3 in less than 2 weeks and are drooling for more!! Can't wait for season 4!
B000PMG16U|5.0|My kids, wife, and I love the movies, even better on blue ray and a fantastic price! Shipping was fast, and uneventful purchase, which is perfect. Thanks!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great options but have not been able to figure out how to highlight the tiles that are free for play. Any tips?
B004WMKSH2|4.0|Light on the action, but necessary to set up part 2. Harder real world edge to this installment of the series.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I like a couple of their songs so much I thought I'd love the album. Not so. Everything sounds the same and it's hard to listen to the entire thing and not get bored. But I love this band! Maybe the next one will be more seasoned and varied.
B005UG542S|5.0|Action packed into this movie. Moved past minor characters and ignored others to<br />keep story moving to the final end .
1451695195|2.0|To be fair, I can't say &#34;I hated&#34; this book. Unlike many, it did grab my attention and keep it. That said,  I can't recommend it.  For one thing, whatever you believe about NDE's (near death experiences), Dr. Alexander's was nothing like any of the NDE's I've ever heard of.  For one thing, almost all report having seen loved ones.  Dr. Alexander did not.  More disturbing for me, as a Christian pastor, Dr. Alexander seems to be a pantheist (God is in everything and we are all a part of God.  He speaks of our journey into our &#34;Divine self&#34;).  He also seems to be a universalist (all roads lead to heaven).  One more thing: one of the statements that he purportedly heard from above was: &#34;There is nothing you can do wrong.&#34;  Really?  Save your money.
0307474259|5.0|Have lost 15 lbs since reading this. Explains why diets and exercise won't work.<br />All made sense to me, thanks Gary for tracking down this story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is additive for all ages and so much fun to play!! I love that you can dress them in different outfits.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Another great story, all the better movie because it faithfully follow the books so well.<br />Changes aren't needed to classics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this games. I play it a lot. It rock so play it it's awesome. I play it every chance I  get. Play it u will love it.don't forget I (vicky) am awesome.
B002MCYWHG|5.0|BEST THING EVER!!!  i would recommend this product to everyone...its so cute and by lil one just loves to ride in it :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a fun game u should try it Tucson for the game gameloft I'm gonna go play it now se ya later bye!
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is really good so far. Season 1 had me hoocked. It's got aliens, action, humor and drama. All done well. Special effects are pretty good too, especially for a TV series.
044024613X|5.0|Wow! One of the best books ever. It's a real page turner. and one I'll always remember. I won't give away the ending, but -- whew!!!<br />If you like suspense novels you'll really like this one.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|WOW<br /><br />Love it.. great mood music... good for paying bills, ie DOOM is this long enuf... heh<br /><br />Not long enough, so here are a few more words space dark death anxiety  surprise shock beauty hot cold creatures lies truth
0061928356|3.0|I don't even remember buying or  reading this book, so it obviously didn't make an impact on me. Enough said.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If you liked the other Quell games you won't be disappointed in this one. The core game and music are very comparable. There are some unexpected changes but they're really interesting. Highly recommended.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This helped me understand what it is I need to do to publish a book. I've always wanted t ok do this.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|These are awesome movies and this quadrant is awesome with lots of extras. It got here super fast and unharmed. I'm very pleased.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game I'm playing with my 8 yr old together.  It takes about as much time for either of us to solve the rooms.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|Birthday present.  What she asked for and she loves it.  Several of her friends had the dolls and even though they shared, she didn't have her own.  Now she does.
B0041D843M|5.0|Real eye opener! This book spells everything out.  Campbell writes this so everyone will understand. He gives great analogies and pictures for easy understanding.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Birthday present.  He really into Legos. He  could hardly wait to put it together and try it out in the pool.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is my favorite.  I love anything she does.  I listen to it allot and sing along all the time.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to find out more about Early Onset Alzheimer's disease. It is well written, with compassion and empathy, and in such a way that the average person can easily understand the devastating effects of this disease.
0307341550|2.0|Negative reviews of books tend to be considered not helpful.  Well, I was captivated and kept reading, unlike some other negative reviewers who said thay found the book boring.  But being captivated is not the same as enjoying.<br /><br />The characters, even including the sad and very damaged Camille, are all unlikeable in the extreme, the town seems to have not one redeeming feature, and the &#34;bad guy&#34; is obvious.  I  wanted to like Camille, and I did feel sad for her, but she lost my sympathy when she threw any semblance of adult behavior out the window in order to do drugs with her little sister, Amma.<br /><br />The all-too-grownup character of 13-year-old Amma is disturbing, as it is supposed to be, but I found myselt wondering why the author continually finds it necessary to dwell on descriptions of her breasts, etc.<br /><br />The pig farm scene is very disturbing, an image I will never erase from my mind. I may never eat pork again.  Maybe it is realistic, but...just too nasty for words.  I finished reading, because I was intrigued, but I was mad at myself for continuing to read such a disturbing, warped little novel.
B003ELY7PG|4.0|Very good and entertaining read with a lot of tips on how to run your Start-Up. The writing style is a bit self centered and just gives prescriptions based on the authors own experience. For that reason only 4 stars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think it's great to let you know exactly how your battery is holding up.  I find it simple to use and easy to understand.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Awesome book took only two days to finish.  I loved every second.  The thought process was the very best part.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|For being free this application does it's job.  I know I still use mine and I'm glad I downloaded it.
B008D30K7E|4.0|Insanely funny book,immensely enjoyable story and characters.I can honestly say I've never read anything like it before and i probably never will again'
B004JZBGWI|4.0|It's just like having sticky notes on your iPad or tablet.  You'll find that it's easy-to-use and it will get someone's attention when you need to notify them of something important that is coming up.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|This is a great app but they want too much money I  You wanna take many pictures your better off just buying the pro version
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I don't mind saying that I have used it several times to alter pictures and use some of the features for comic use.  It would be great for beginners, but not for those that are used to an extensive photo editing studio.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|would like this game in a kids view. you could give a little more balls per level. great game for the whole family.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|ENJOY WATCHING AT MY PACE, CATCHING UP ON ALL<br />THAT I MISSED DURING THE SEASONS.  LOVE SEEING<br />MAGGIE SMITH AND SHIRLEY MC CLAIN, GREAT SERIES<br />AND STORY LINE ABOUT MANSION HELP AND THE PEOPLE<br />THEY SERVE CARE OF.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loooved this book. I didn't want to read another book after I read this one I loved it so much. :) I even made my sister read it, she loved it too.
B007SGM084|5.0|Didn't know what I was getting into with this but I loved the series. It holds you from the beginning till the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What an awesome series.  I love everything about it.  I love the history most of all, the glimpse into the culture of the times, the customs.  The lovely costumes and the authentic historic setting add to the history.  The characters are quite charming, each with such distinct personalities.  I thoroughly enjoy watching this series as I have the previous two seasons.
B005Y4241K|5.0|She sings with such passion and emotion that touches your heart.  Nothing fancy, just a pleasure watching and listening to her.  A soulful experience. She brings it every time!  Love her!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Had to have it... My DVD died and so I had to replace with all the essential bonus features. Great!
B0012PDVUS|2.0|Very overrated.  The set design was cutting edge, but the story was boooooring.  I'm shocked how highly rated this movie is on IMDB.
0312944926|4.0|THis thriller was a fun, can't-put-it-down type book, although it wasn't as good as the Da Vinci Code.  Other commenters have different opinions, but I thought the reason this novel was less interesting and engaging than Da Vinci Code was because computers, algorithms an math-whiz employees at an NSA cubicle-complex just inherently aren't as interesting as art, architecture, cobwebby corridors of old European Churches and museums, Leonardo Da Vinci,the Holy Grail, Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and a secret locked inside a cryptex.<br /><br />The main laugh I had about this book, was that it's plot centers on the urgency of NSA getting hold of information about a so-called \\"unbreakable code\\" that some computer genius has invented.  I laughed because I am practically a computer know-nothing, and yet, with just a bit of amateur research into cryptography, I myself am easily able to write an \\"unbreakable code\\" that neither NSA nor any other cryptographer could crack, and if I wanted to I could use such a code to correspond in emails with anyone else in the world.  THerefore it seems silly that in this novel several individuals go through conniption fits and dangle millions of dollars in hopes of getting ownership of such an unbreakable code.<br />The secret to an unbreakable code is hardly worth millions: it is easily found in some of the basic books on secret codes and cryptography that are readily available to us all, generally for less than $20.
B00846REIS|5.0|If your up to reading a hot, sexy, erotic book, then start turning the pages on this one. Sylvia Day won't disappoint. 1st in the Crossfire series.
B005NJFSZK|5.0|My little boy loves this car, and plays with it often. It arrived quickly, and in good shape. it was definitely worth it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game will keep you guessing. it is a fun mind activity for sure.  but you shouldnt give up too easily.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|quite a bit too much going on, Plasma Sky is a much better example of the genre.  This one failed to grab me.
B0027MJU00|4.0|A good story...you may have guessed from the title, it is dark and somewhat graphic.  It is a mystery right until the end.  When you think you have it figured out...you don't.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle is a great series. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good drama, mystery or crime procedural. It is very well written and I love the way Castle draws on his home life as well as his craft to help with the cases.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I did not watch Lost when it was on TV and have bought each season.  Good show and would recommend the series if you have not seen it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie.  I have had trouble with the speed and slowing and stopping as I view online.  Will try again.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I didn't really play the trail game enough to enjoy it. This game is definitely more interactive than other hidden object games.
0486407217|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic!  I have already made two gowns and the instructions are so easy to follow.  Anyone who likes to make Victorian fashions - You need this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reviewed and didn't think I would like.  A library book club recommendation.  Tense - twists - couldn't put it down.
0486283577|5.0|The patterns in this book is explained in detail to help both the experienced and inexperienced seamstress to sew beautiful gowns of days gone by.  The patterns are authentic in detail and so beautiful when completed.  Anyone one who loves to sew their own clothes should have this book!
B008Y7CZUY|5.0|It's a travel movie with Julie Roberts plus a love interest. Julia is such a girl but interesting. You got to love Julia to watch this but what's not to love?
B005SCSL56|5.0|Well written and innovative. A good read for young and old.<br /><br />Engages your imagination and takes you into the lives of the characters.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Corny maybe, outlandish and unbelievable possibly, but basically a love story that you will want to succeed. The little robot that tried, who found love and against all odds was committed to make it work. Classic.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Funny and poignant all at once. Chris Colfer is amazing for such a young writer.<br /><br />The after death flash backs are an interesting twist.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Two women, three generations apart, find themselves united in a common thread of unusual circumstances. So well written, with very likable characters. The story unfolds as an alternate narrative of events from the perspective and experiences of both. Well done all around.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this book to read to my one year old son. It is short and simple and makes for a quick bed time read on those fussy nights. It describes all the types of activities that people do before going to bed such as bathing, brushing your teeth and putting on pajamas. Sandra Boynton's illustrations are great and my son loves them. The book is a small board book so it is the perfect size for my son to pick up and look at on his own. I hope he keeps this cute little book and reads it to his children in the future!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Played on kindle fire hd. Loaded instantly. Extremely challenging. Great graphics. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this screwdriver kit! I have it on my person at all times! Since I bought htis, I've disassembled my PS3, my laptop, was able to repair my friend's laptop, and have been able to disassemble just about everything in arms reach! Because of this screwdriver kit I have been able to keep all my electronics clean from any interior dust (especially my PS3, since it has special screws).
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I cant say that this is anywhere near my favorite movie. but I do like the music in it. I can turn it on in the background and just listen to it. I would not recommend it for younger kids but thats just me (mostly because they are college kids, freshmen) and there is drinking and sexual references. But its a cute movie for older teens +. I admit I have watched/listened to it about 3 times over the weekend.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|Most songs are very up tempo, feel good, summer party kind of songs, on the edge of country and pop.  Hence the version (not on here) with Nelly.  But, with at least three hits topping the charts, the album is a good buy.
0142419400|5.0|This cover is absolutely beautiful and the book is in excellent condition. I was very satisfied with this purchase. This is one of my favorite books and I love the new cover.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|The best part of Argo is the story. It is true and I believe Argo really caught the feel of the times.  I was an undergrad at Indiana University at the time and remember this episode in our nation's history very clearly, even though I am now 53. I witnessed pro-US rallies there, as well as events put on by Iranian students in favor of the revolution.<br /><br />I do not feel this film deserved an Academy Award for Best Picture, however.  The acting was good, but not great.  Ben Affleck has never impressed me as a very good actor in his previous works, and he did nothing to change my mind with this effort.  Character development was mediocre at best. By the end of the film, I really did not identify with any of the characters.  That is a problem for me.  I want to feel some kind of kinship or emotion for at least one or two characters in a film.  Argo did not achieve that for me.<br /><br />I was also disappointed in the aspect ratio of this movie: 2.35 : 1.  I did not buy a large screen Samsung HDTV to watch BluRays with a large black strip on the top and bottom of the screen.  I can understand it to a degree in older movies that have been adapted to BluRay, but not movies produced in the last four or five years.  Unacceptable.<br /><br />My wife and I have now watched Les Miserables (2012) twice--once in the theater last year, and last weekend in our home theater.  It left us speechless both times.  It is an epic film.  Why Argo won Best Picture over Les Miserables is inexplicable.  If you ask me about Argo 15 years from now, I might remember it....maybe.  If you ask me about Les Meserables 15 years from now, it will be emblazoned on my memory, God willing.<br /><br />Instead of buying this movie, save a few bucks and rent this movie on Netflix, Amazon or Vudu.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|That's why I like it... I don't love it when they run off with my kindle!!! it's a lot of fun to watch them play, they do enjoy the game.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|As stated there are many different levels that can be played and different options to  increase the difficulty. I love the background set and the ambient sound effect that plays in the background. Graphics are excellent and the price can't be beat.
B00622B3MY|5.0|Quality is equal to the DVD. The quality degrades if your internet connection slows down. Would prefer if it would pause while it buffers the rest of the movie.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|The price was right for the five pack. No problem when I used the first one and now I have spares.
0812550706|5.0|I loved this book. Although it is not very long it is engaging and I found myself completely engrossed in it. The writing style places you right inside the main character's head. The emotions this book brings up will affect you for a long time.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Simple, honest, and to the point - what every combat memoir should be. John Keegan rated it one of the five best ever.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome TV series. Highly recommended. Aliens, ships, guns, explosions, bad guys, good guys, not so good guys. it has it all.
B00E13ZRFA|4.0|This is such a great song, and will make for a great addition for 'Halcyon Days.' It's a bit more commercialized than some of the material on 'Halcyon,' but that doesn't make it bad in any way.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game I hope that they make a space speacial where the trains are space ships or space shuttles please
B004TI1WME|4.0|It worked, everyone needs a calculator on your kindle. Why do I need to comment on how great it is, its a calculator!!
B00004WXAA|1.0|I recieved te product in a timely fashion but it turned out to be scratched at least from songs 1 to 4 on disc one. I seriously doubt it is actually new!!!  I'd like to know how to return it and have a new one back.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I dislike the way Archer leaves each book up-on-the air with no conclusive ending. It demands that one buy the next book to learn what is going to happen.<br /><br />The plots are interesting, if improbable. Fun, easy read.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Except for the (literal) vomit humor, I loved this movie. I'm not the musical kind of guy, but the cast was hilarious, the story progressed at a good pace, and they did a great job with the music.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I saw the movie and enjoyed it despite avg reviews. However I knew the book was very different. I am not into the &#34;zombie&#34; fad sweeping the nation but this book sets a good tone with it all and makes it very accessible to anyone who wants to read it.Die hard Romero fans as well as the avg reader. Recommend picking it up
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This is a pretty good movie. Very funny, good music, hilarious characters and interactions. Plus most of the cast and crew don't look to shabby. What more could you want?
1596680296|5.0|Wonderful and very informative.  I have only started knitting about 6 months ago.  Completed my first pair of socks last week in class at my local yarn store.  I loved making the socks and wanted to continue, after reviewing this book I think I could have knitted socks using this book.  Very pleased with my purchase.
B0081KTHEQ|2.0|It's an okay movie, I guess. The movie primarily relied on jump scares, and just plain wasn't creepy over all.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Movie is exhilarating and well put together.  Although I would never would want that to happen to my child. It's must see movie.
B00498XRPE|5.0|It's a classic and a masterpiece. With a Stephen King-style ending. Everything from the cinematography to the musical score come together to creep you out.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Although this is not one of the best Sookie novels I'm still sorry to say goodbye to these characters. I've enjoyed reading every Sookie book and sure there are some better than others but I looked forward to picking up each new release. Bye Bye Bon Temps!
B001BR5NN0|4.0|I didn't have the opportunity to go to a public high school, so I wasn't able to connect with the characters on quite the level I was expecting. Still, it was interesting to watch the characters begin to question their social structure and preconceived notions of one another based on the stereotypes they fell into. One of my friends that watched it with me said she would've enjoyed the movie more if she had seen it while she was still in High School.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie has good performances all around.
B002SHD9E2|3.0|Let me start by saying that musicals aren't my thing.  That said, I would still rate &#34;Les Miserables (2012)&#34; with five stars.  This version of Phantom of the Opera looked 40 years old, rather than a cutting edge movie from 2004.  I didn't enjoy the acting.  It was hard to relate to the actors.  The emotion was over dramatized and didn't feel real.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I bought this album primarily for just a handful of the songs, and ended up falling in love with most of them. Macklemore manages to challenge you on several important social issues without being preachy. (Catchy? Yes. Preachy? Naw.)
0670014893|4.0|My first go of charging ahead with A Delicate Truth failed as I lost my way in the detailed, complex story line filtered through with British slang.  But, when I started fresh and gave A Delicate Truth the concentration that it demanded, I was justly rewarded.  With emphasis on every sentence, the thrilling story of political cover-up came alive. A finely written fully believable story of government folly, political double talk, the murder of an honorable soldier, and of a weak, pedestrian retirement bureaucrat who elevated his game to right a grave wrong.  Yes, the whistle blower and friends succeed in publishing the truth of despicable government misconduct.  Don't pass up the enjoyment of this all too true story of government run amuck and of the difference a few honorable folks can make.<br /><br />I received a free copy of A Delicate Truth through Goodreads Firstreads.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|watched it with my kids, who had never heard of it. Was both nostalgic and fun for me, and they enjoyed it immensely. While all the actors are solid (even Julia Roberts and Tinkerbell) Dustin Hoffman really steals the show. He really chews up his lines as the Captain. (even of a passenger plain, wink-wink) Over-all, it was a good time.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I am very disappointed in the redesign. It sucks. I can't figure anything out on it. It was fine before . I have found the information to be inaccurate. It also has my main location way away form where I live. I can't fix the issue. This app is no longer user friendly.
B009Y6231U|2.0|Kurt Russel is fine (though nearly mute) and I like him as an actor... most everything he's done is enjoyable. This, however is one of those times where he could not save this. While I could point out all the random &#34;huh?&#34; moments where you catch editing that jumps ahead in time/space and simply breaks visual continuity, I'll just point out that this movie commits the biggest mistake of any action flick... it's boring. Yes, there are plenty of nods to many sci-fi movies if you catch them. Yes, the soldier (Russel) is suitably imposing, as is the main &#34;enemy.&#34; (Jason Scott Lee) These things were not enough though. There was simply not much action and not much actual exploration of the emotion that is obvious under the Soldier's silent persona. Everything was handled rather ham-fisted and I didn't care for anyone in the story. (the creators gave me no reason to) There was so much dead-space in the middle 3rd of the flick that could have carried that emotion but instead gave us a Van Damme-esque 80s movie montage of &#34;recovery&#34; that I pretty much checked out. I only continued because I knew that the Russel and Lee's characters had to have an epic fight at the climax... but that is where the movie gave me the final let-down. The fight was horribly choreographed, badly shot and edited to either show those elements off, or it was so bad that the editor just gave up... thankfully the fight was quick. &#60;sigh&#62;
B00ABKGG0C|2.0|Parts of story are missing or unexplained.  Fair writing.  Formula story.  Characterizations incomplete.  I would not read another book by this author.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it. It's fun and addicting. Not to hard or too easy. I gave it only four stars because there needs to be more levels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well done with some history to boot.  I really enjoy the actors and actresses as they portray what life may have been like back in London during those days.
B00B8PRDHE|3.0|Nothing compared to the band's performance at the Greek Theater, Los Angeles, July 21, 2012; EVERYONE was on their game...a tremendous performance and the finale' was unsurpassed....Joe Walsh from the Eagles, Jack Bruce from Cream, Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees, Peter Frampton, Jeff Lynn of ELO; Edgar Winter, and others.....just tremendous.....
