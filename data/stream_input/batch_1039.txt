B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant largely continues the sound that brought him Grammy-winning success with Alison Krauss with \\"Raising Sand\\" on \\"Band of Joy.\\" Moving dexterously in and out of these instantly endearing dozen tunes with his iconic voice, he fittingly creates a joyful noise.<br /><br />This is a particularly unpolished, bare-bones approach to storytelling through song that Plant works extremely well in. Things are light, airy and full of life even on the darker selections, due in no small part to the uncluttered production that lets the songs breathe.<br /><br />Even though this is a mix of American and British roots folk music, Plant and his band perform these tunes with such nuance, joie de vivre - and also articulate, invested professionalism - that they snap, crackle and pop with searing originality and renewed sense of purpose.<br /><br />The frenetic \\"You Can't Buy My Love,\\" one of the many tracks on which Plant is supported in vocals by the wonderful Patti Griffin, segues lovingly and perfectly into the elegiac, achingly beautiful \\"I'm Falling In Love Again.\\" His vocals are lilting and sweetly affected - like that of a much younger man - on the earnest \\"The Only Sound that Matters.\\"<br /><br />The awesome \\"Angel Dance\\" floats whipped cream-like with unpretentious decadence - Plant asks his listeners to take the material seriously while also throwing caution to the wind and having a casual, fun listening experience merely for the sake of having one. This allows for an album that draws the listener in - a set of tunes as inviting as hot cocoa on a biting cold day. This creates an atmosphere that is warm, pleasing and even soothing; a slight contrast to the brilliant but more deliberate, restrained \\"Raising Sand\\" with Krauss. Even the heavy-hearted \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down,\\" which derives muscular strength from its matter-of-fact, less-is-more approach.<br /><br />Sincerity counts for a lot, and today's rising performers are often lacking it. They could learn a lot from listening to Plant and Griffin duetting resplendently on the painstakingly beautiful \\"Harm's Swift Way,\\" with its thoughtful ruminations on mortality and the urgency inherent within that. The heart-on-sleeve, self-effacing honesty with which this song - and the rest here, for that matter - are delivered is an unfortunate rarity in contemporary music. It makes a recording like this one a rare treat in the new releases section.<br /><br />Is this Led Zeppelin? No, certainly not. There is no recreating the past without an ensuing sense of loss, and Plants clearly knows this. By changing gears and defying expectations he has managed to avoid becoming a nostalgia act - no small feat for a rock icon. Faithfully following his muse, if \\"Band of Joy\\" is any indication, has been a wise decision.in duetting resplendently on the painstakingly beautiful \\"Harm's Swift Way,\\" with its thoughtful ruminations on mortality and the urgency inherent within that.

B003XX2PPO|5.0|Luis Miguel sabe hacer canciones rítmicas y sabe cantar baladas. En Cómplices (su disco antetrior, uno de sus mejores pero menos comerciales) dejó de lado lo primero para darle más voz al sentimiento y las letras profundas y maduras de Manuel Alejandro.   Hoy, el artista ha tomado las riendas de la producción de su disco y se ha involucrado en las letras, quizás menos poéticas, pero que funcionan bien para el estilo musical desenfadado y \\"popero\\" que nos presenta con este material.  Un disco muy rítmico con canciones que tienen madera de clásicos, entre ellas \\"Mujer de Fuego\\" que mucho recuerda a su otro gran éxito \\"Qué nivel de mujer\\"; también \\"Siento\\" tiene potencial para trascender al igual que sus baladas \\"No existen límites\\" y \\"Lo que queda de Mí\\", ambas de Armando Manzanero. La primera de ellas quizás sea una de las mejores baladas de toda su carrera, pues además en este disco, Luis Miguel se ha reinventado interpretando canciones lentas. La tesitura de su voz es distinta y lo sabrán reconocer quienes conozcan sus discos y tengan el oído educado.  Se lo podría reprochar a este disco su corta duración y la ausencia del compositor y productor Juan Carlos Calderón, a quien muchos esperábamos ver por ahí en los créditos, pues mucho se dijo de su participación en este disco. También son un poco reprochables los arreglos de las baladas que son iguales en casi todas y aun iguales a las de discos anteriores. Pero la realidad es que obviando ese aspecto, cada balada es una joya a nivel interpretativo.  Más de lo mismo, sí tal vez, pero no suena del todo igual. Hay cierta sofisticación en este pop, una sofisticación sutil pero que sin duda conquista el oído.
B003V5PPZG|3.0|Linkin Park have been a tight, incredibly solid band for the past decade. Both \\"Meteora\\" and \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" were fine records that were well-arranged and filled with excellent, even profoundly well-crafted songs, including those that did not make it to the radio.<br /><br />With \\"A Thousand Suns\\" the group maintains its inspiration and creative juices, but only a little more than that.<br /><br />Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington ooze passion and commitment, yet very few of the songs catch hold, and the ones that do - including singles \\"The Catalyst\\" and \\"Waiting for the End\\" - are not as strong as the vast majority of the songs from their last two albums.<br /><br />The guys attempt a great deal and make some heavy artistic statements about the state of the world and our collective understanding as a people, both on the local and global level, but these messages - admirable though they may be are - are buried in generally uninteresting, though pleasant, songs.<br /><br />The best by far is \\"Wretches and Kings\\" with its message of recognizing the real enemies (as George Carlin called them, \\"The Big Club\\") who walk among us and immobilize the lower classes. However, the rousing speech from political activist Mario Savio is stronger and more memorable than the song itself.<br /><br />The album is still a fine, if, essentially, forgettable, listening experience. \\"Blackout\\" is fueled by intense, boiling-over-the-top anger, sadness and frustration, and \\"When They Come For Me\\" has more energy and precision than the majority of the tracks. \\"Robot Boy\\" also has some smooth, chilled grooves that work well.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"A Thousand Suns\\" is its consistent efforts to scintillate with musical pleas for elevated social consciousness. That central theme is never strayed from, so the record manages coherence.<br /><br />Linkin Park have their first mild album here. It is not a poor record by any means, but it is filled with artistic promise that it only sometimes fulfills. It pales in comparison to what this band has previously proven itself capable of.is band has previously proven itself capable of.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|WOW--this film is an alpine/climbing movie tour de force. Gripping, terrifying, heatbreaking--so scary you can't look but can't take your eyes off either. The story of 2 German Alpine troops who are climbers and childhood friends, they fall into the glory awaiting them and for Germany if they conquer the North face of the Eiger. This film has a rather 'slow' start and at first I was unsure how the climbing scenes could make up for that--but boy they did! As you watch the two climbers battle the brutal conditions you'll be shocked by the primitive equipment they were using in 1936. It's hard to describe just how great and suspensful this movie is--it leaves you speechless at the ending. As one of the workers on the Eiger says to some tourists waiting for the climbers to start their ascent, \\"Eiger is swiss for 'Ogre' and the 'monster' will swallow up anyone who gets too close to it.\\" And that's exactly what happens.
B003XL6EKS|5.0|Brandon Flowers has done an amazing job with his first solo album, Flamingo. This is an album that captures all the great themes of the Western United States, as well as the country as a whole.     The opening track, \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\", sets the tone for the album. Flamingo is a musical journey that engages the listener from start to finish     Fans of The Killers will definitely love this album, but Flamingo ventures down a road that is different from any of The Killers album. Brandon leaves his unique impression on each and every well crafted song...and you can clearly hear that in the music     I would recommend this album to anyone who's a fan of Rock 'N Roll, or good music in general
0525950079|5.0|i sent this book as a gift to a friend but i had already read it in a day and a half flat. talk about unputdownable. i think my eyes would have staged a revolution if i let them as well as my butt for not getting off the couch as i read more than a thousand pages. once again, ken follett has written a classic. he just has the knack to write about something simple into something great. the characters come alive in your imagination and it's just too bad that no hollywood producer makes this into a movie the way they do those boring vampire crap.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Anyone in the US who eats should watch this video.  It is amazing the monopoly a handfull of people have over the food industry.  This video is not pushing any brand or political view it simply states the facts of the current food industry.
0439023483|5.0|I picked up this book, after reading a few suggestions on the internet, including a suggestion from Stephenie Meyer.  The book is fantastic.  Yes, it has romantic elements, but the story is so much more than that.  It's political, thought provoking, heart wrenching, brutal, and powerful.  It really has the chance to really make a generation that cares more about text messaging and other frivolities really think about what's right and wrong not just for the individual but for the whole of a country.<br />It is not for the feint of heart, children kill each other, but the bigger picture is worth the read.  The characters are so perfect, you love the ones that you're supposed to love and hate the ones you shouldn't.<br />Suzanne Collins to me wrote a great novel, well.  When I saw the new Star Wars trilogy, I was able to see what George Lucas was doing.  Around all the cheese of Jar Jar and the whininess of Anakin, he was trying to make the audience remember something about government.  That when the people get complacent, our liberties are taken away from us.<br />The world Suzanne Collins created does this on a much more poignant level.  She doesn't throw it in your face, but she really makes you, the reader, think about what you truly believe in.<br />I highly recommend it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|A little pricey, but well worth the cost when I receive in return full piece and quiet while my husband plays his games.  He even has the luxury of being able to pay attention to the things around him because these wonderful earphones do not disrupt outside noise.  His gaming experience is better and my quiet time is better.  A win-win in my book, so I give these headphones two thumbs up.

0553805371|5.0|I thought this book was delightful. The subject matter is fascinating for any armchair physicist, even if it is a little difficult to understand at times. Hawking and Mlodinow have written this book in a very casual, storytelling style. This makes it a lot easier to follow the material. Some have criticized the lack of references, but I would have found endless lists of references pretty distracting given the style of writing. Some minor footnotes regarding certain points might have been nice, but in general, a lot of the stuff that \\"should\\" have been cited is either (a) fairly common knowledge that could easily be googled for more info, or (b) personal theoretical work of the authors anyway.    My only complaint is that this book is short. More details in certain sections could have been nice, but at the same time, more detail might have taken away from the accessibility and easy-to-understand writing style that Hawking and Mlodinow used in the book.    For those who are wondering, based on the multitudes debating about this book currently: Hawking does not actually say there is no god. What he says is that it is possible to explain the emergence of the universe and everything we see around us without resorting to a divine source. In other words, he says god is not necessary. That doesn't mean god definitely doesn't exist; it doesn't mean god can't exist - it just means that there is no reason to assume the existence of the universe is \\"proof\\" of god, since there are equally valid scientific explanations.    I would definitely recommend reading this book, though, especially if you are interested in theoretical physics & cosmology. The current theories are very elegantly explained in this book, and the occasional humor interjected by the authors makes it an enjoyable read.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The music sounds great, I can't add to what others have said.  I want to warn people that I have bought two sets from Market-place sellers.  One has distorted sound on some tracks so I am pretty sure it is a pirated copy.  The seller gave me a refund. Another (Just-Launched) seller switched the disks from the Stereo Box set and put them in the Mono box.  The discs themselves don't say Mono or Stereo just the packaging. I had to make a claim to Amazon because the seller didn't answer my e-mails when I found the switch.  Amazon made good on their guarantee. If you buy from a Marketplace seller, make sure it is an established seller with great feedback.  When you get the set, listen carefully to all the discs for flaws and check on your computer to see if the disks are tagged as Mono. I am going to buy the set this time directly from Amazon.  They are pricey but I would rather get the real thing than pay less but get a fake.
014062029X|5.0|Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry.  \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them.  What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners.  \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.<br /><br />After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge.  As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter.  Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane.  While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life.  As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not.  Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.<br /><br />Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man.  His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late.  \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane.  The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy., with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.

B003EYVXYG|4.0|First - old-school Romero fan. Second - like his style anyway with the socio-political underpinings he usually does.  Third - admit to being sad that this installment took us no further than the Diary of the Dead (and in some aspects maybe even took a step backward) did, in terms of world impact of the zombie outbreak.  Not a bad film and still has the Romero touch - but please George - let's get back to the old school zombie impact upon the world that you showed in your originals.
B003LAH7MU|4.0|Well, I listened to this album, thinking I would hate it. Sting seems of late to be a little uninspired in my humble opinion.<br />However, repeated listenings have made it a favorite. These are beautiful, fresh renditions of the classic songs, which makes you hear them properly again after all these years. The words are far clearer and the power and dignity of Sting's lyrics come to the fore. The arrangements and instrumentation are lovely (not at all syrupy). I can't stop listening and I recommend that you give this collection a chance!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies!  John waters just knows exactly what i want to see... whether it be a 50's greaser musical or a 70's filth-fest...  Hilarious dialogue and engaging story!!!  you really get to know the characters!!  this is a great movie, whether you are a die-hard john waters fan or a pastor's daughter! (you may want to stay away from waters' other films if that is the case though haha)
B001GKJ2FC|3.0|The main problem with this film was that if you read the 6 story comic book that this movie was to take after you would have been pissed to find out that they completely changed the story line of this film.  There was no league of assasins, no cloth making materials, no freakin killing for the purpose of others.  The real story was that Wesly's father was part of a group who were villians all the villians got together killed all the super heros of the world and divided the world amongst themselves.  One of the supervillians wanted to come out of hidding instead of ruling behind the scenes because the portion of the world he received wasnt that profitable.  Wesley's father was actually in the book started out in a 3-some with two other guys while video taping it.  So how in the world did this come out I will never know.  The character in the comic book were not hero's and raped, murdered, and killed for fun.  How do you change that by making a movie.  The problem with movie companies is that they are afraid to go towards the actual transistions of the film because it might not be profitable or because its a little to raunchy for the thearter.  You knew what the story was about but you chopped it up and made it about bullet bending when in the comic book only a few characters knew how to do it.<br /><br />But I guess if you only saw the movie it wasnt that bad but you really need to read the comic book because I myself am not a comic book reader a friend of mine put me on and when I read the first book I couldnt wait for the next and since it only came out with 6 books was like what in the world I had to buy my own greater story in the comic book with real a**holes and Wesley wasnt all that nice either.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|\\"Band of Joy\\" is a beautiful, sprawling album of covers that seems obsessed with finding the spiritual origins in the original material. Oh, and the album is truly excellent. \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down,\\" is whipped into a low burning fervor with mandolin and a melodic choir. Where I expected it to go, foot stomping and handclapping, Plant avoids it, turning the song into something bittersweet and almost hopeless.     Plant's versions of Low's \\"Silver Rider\\" and \\"Monkey\\" finds something that the original material doesn't have, Patti Griffin. Her vocals on these songs seem almost unhinged and otherworldly, the polar opposite to Krauss' ethereal vocals on \\"Raising Sand.\\" Griffin gives both of these songs a raw grit that the originals didn't dig into. She slides in and out on some of these songs like a gentle breeze, barely noticeable. And on others, she's jostling Plant, giving him an expected run for his money ... I mean, it is Patty Griffin after all.     There are a few faster numbers here such as \\"Angel Dance,\\" and they are well worth listening to. But the disc belongs to the more slower, contemplative songs. \\"The Only Sound That Matters\\" seems to sums up the album as a whole, there is an obsession with sound, from the harmony to melody, everything seems as if it were designed to be where it is, not an easy feat for an album full of covers. On \\"The Only Sound that Matters,\\" Plant's voice is so alive and present that he transfers the lyrics into something spiritual, almost mystical.    Buddy Miller as co-producer should be given just as much credit as T-Bone Burnet (one listen to \\"Cindy I'll Marry You One Day,\\" should make that evident). \\"Band of Joy\\" is not as pristine as \\"Raising Sand.\\" It's grittier, messier, more joyous - and well worth the purchase.

B001P06GX4|5.0|We took this game on a family vacation with family members from age 4 to grandparents.  Everyone enjoyed the game, according to skill level.  Of course, the younger children did not understand the strategy totally. They still liked to play.  It would not be fun for them to play with older people who were totally into winning.
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|Did I miss the 10-second explanation buried inside this piece of braindead silliness somewhere about how \\"Flatspace technology\\" works?  See, that's how heroine Violet (Milla Jovovich, all bare-midriffed and tight-assed and leather-clad) can just suddenly have access to any number of guns or swords that she needs at any instant to kill the dozens or hundreds of similarly-armed bad guys that keep getting thrown at her in nearly every scene in this 87-minutes-too-long film.  Perhaps I also missed the explanation as to how Violet went from seemingly ordinary mother-to-be to unstoppable killing machine in a decade also?  How she fooled the extremely detailed scans of her actual DNA in the beginning of the film that should have kept her from entering a top-secret lab and taking the secret weapon in the humans' war against the hemophages - viral vampires of which she is the most perfect example.<br /><br />Yep, I must have missed all of the backstory, character development, and all sense of what the narrative is supposed to add up to here; or maybe it's all in the extra 6 minutes or whatever in the \\"Unrated Director's Cut\\" which (fortunately or not) isn't the version I watched.  Somehow I doubt it.  Somehow I think the entire reason this film exists is to show Milla dressed in a variety of skintight outfits killing literally hundreds and hundreds of bad guys in one heavily CGI-d, lightning-edited, MATRIX-like sequence after another.  Narrative sense, backstory, characterizations - all disposable to director/writer Kurt Wimmer, the man behind the astonishingly highly-rated EQUILIBRIUM, which at least does have a guy who can act when necessary, and a sort of plot to fall back on when the action flags a bit.  That film I thought was a prime example of the poverty of imagination in most American genre filmmaking - and the poverty of expectations in audiences that will lap up the same 50-year-old ideas in film after film as long as there are enough bullets and flying kicks.  Strangely enough ULTRAVIOLET hasn't maintained any kind of reputation, though for my money it's only slightly more inane.<br /><br />Oh, that's not to say that there isn't some slight pretense of a story here if you look hard for it; but most of it is lifted from John Cassavetes' 10 million times better GLORIA (1980) - a badass woman ends up taking care of a little boy who is the key to the bad guys' goals.  In that case, the son of the victims in a mob hit; in this case, a kid who is apparently the \\"weapon\\" that will be used against the hemophages (man, even the wordS Wimmer constructs are stupid).  But all that really does is lend a tiny, tiny bit of drama to the proceedings - Violet is so unstoppable that only having a kid to take care of could ever slow her down.  And that's really the problem in a nutshell, narrative-wise - where's the drama when you KNOW that the heroine simply cannot fail?<br /><br />But it's not completely awful (hence the second star).  The film was shot on digital video and it shows, but not always in a bad way.  I rather liked the brightness of the colors and the softness of some scenes, it was at times hard to tell just how much was CGI in a given sequence and the oddness of the Shanghai and Hong Kong architecture, where the film was shot, adds to the visual quality.  And Milla DOES look spectacularly hot.  But overall this is no deeper or more interesting as a story than most videogames, and the aesthetic isn't much different.  If I liked it just a bit more than the similarly braindead MR. AND MRS. SMITH that I watched last week, I guess it's because my expectations were even lower, and the SF milieu is more inherently appealing to me; but really it's on about the same level of inanity.  I guess if that's your bag, and you like the MATRIX films, EQUILIBRIUM, and Michael Bay's style of nonstop action with only the barest of plots, you might like it more than I did.enough ULTRAVIOLET hasn't maintained any kind of reputation, though for my money it's only slightly more inane.

B001KZI2WW|5.0|I bought my first pair at the Denver Airport store for nearly $65 because they felt so good. I think they have a relaxed look that will likely put some people off. They are meant to fray a bit more after wearing and look like a surf bum might wear them. They hold up great and feel better but are sort of beachy looking. They have a removable insert that I can pull out and hand wash as I do the canvas part. I don't recommend the washer and dryer. I threw mine in the dryer and they shrank a little, I had been desperate because I had taken them rafting and they were soaked. Anyway, I have 2 pairs and keep the second as back-up for later use. They are super light, comfortable and perfectly easy to care for.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|This film was my first Blu Ray purchase from Amazon and it was fabulous. I experienced no problems playing it on my player and was therefore looking forward to purchasing more. Unfortunately two friends of mine have since purchased Blu Ray films from Amazon and they are unable to play them on their players. Since I was able to play Julie and Julia I suggested they bring them over and try them on my player. Alas the new movies would also not play on my player. As you would suspect I am now a bit gun shy with regard to further purchases......waste of money if they will not play. With DVD purchases it usually stipulates the region as USA only, but with Blu Ray there is no specifications in the product description like this.    HOW CAN I PURCHASE BLU RAY FROM AMAZON WITH CONFIDENCE I WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY IT HERE IN AUSTRALIA?????
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I began by watching the show on TV and became utterly enamored by it. The characters are delightful and their stories draw you in. It's got a bit of everything, as my title mentions, and it is shot in New Zealand so the scenery is breathtaking. Richard and Kahlan's love story is so beautiful. It's nice to see two people who are in love become friends and even fight together. Each episode is so creative with just the right of humor, sexual tension, swords and monsters.<br /><br />I am working through the books now. Although a TV show is never really like the books and vice versa, the story works well in both venues.
B003UHYSDK|4.0|It's hard to look back to the days of classic rock for inspiration without being pegged as a mere imitator. Black Mountain are clearly disciples of genre forefathers like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, but they bring a certain harmonious folk element to their work that helps to keep it from being mere derivation on the themes of those bands. Naturally, you're going to find that kind of heavy stomp that is synonymous with Zeppelin and Sabbath, but Black Mountain do things their own way, and they are given to long, proggy outings over tighter rock 'n roll. Wilderness Heart is a blend of heavier, driving rock songs and ominous folk numbers. Most songs feature both of the bands' singers, both talented and carrying the necessary bravado for their roles, but I wish that when singing in unison that they would sing more harmonies, where instead they are usually singing the same melody in a different octave.
0399536108|5.0|I'm only half way through the book but I've already made some serious changes in how I approach my day. I'm considered a very organized person, but two of the exercises in this book took me to a place of knowing where I'm going and why. That's a very nice place to be.    The book starts off slowly, but once the introductory stuff is over, the meat of the book is to help you figure out who you are, what you want out of life, and who you can help along the way.    I highly recommend this book. And I hope it will revolutionize the way you look at your life.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great product.  Not just a documentary, but just as entertaining as informative and well worth the time to watch all the way through.  I highly recommend this to everyone, even those not interested in our home planet will be entertained by this series.  BBC makes much better film than any US documentary film crew.
0765326353|5.0|Like many, I first heard of Sanderson after Robert Jordan's death.  I read Elantris and found it to be one of the better novels I had read in some time, so I picked up the Mistborn series.  It ranks up there in my top 5 series.  I think that's because I'm a sucker for the formula that Sanderson uses - create a world with laws of nature somewhat different from our own, explain the laws of nature through the characters, and unfold a story with these characters that explaining the history and events of the world.    If you liked the Mistborn series and aren't put off by 1000 page installments, you'll likely enjoy the Way of Kings.
0374158460|4.0|As a pilgrimage, this Sept 1st, I drove down to hear Jonathan Franzen launch his book tour at the Capitola Book Cafe (just south of Santa Cruz). The area is apparently a good enough place for birding to draw Franzen away from NY City for part of every year. The Corrections is my favorite book of the noughties. As but one tiny validation of Franzen's magisterial intellect, his 2001 novel described a music startup called \\"eigen-Melody\\", and at that very moment startups in SF (moodlogic, e.g.) were using those very statistical techniques to develop a music preference engine. Freedom is a very fine novel, running across a thousand themes woven into an engaging tapestry. It is a superb novel, even though it's not quite as delightful as the Corrections. After finishing the novel, and re-reading the opening chapter, I still have a haunting doubt: Is it plausible that the lengthy embedded autobiography could be such a virtuosic work? It's written by Patty Berglund, the jock star/stay at home mom at the center of the novel. Throughout her parts, self-conscious references are made to \\"the autobiographer.\\" But in almost every way, Patty Berglund's ability to conjure up a scene is as artful as Franzen. I kept thinking of DFW's story, Mr. Squishy, which he published under the pseudonym, Elizabeth Klemm. Other than the female name, David Foster Wallace inflected almost nothing to merit the beardlessness of his pen name. Franzen does a better job, to be sure. Even if I don't find the ventriloquism of Patty Berglund to be perfect, it's a small imperfection. Probably the reason I give this book 4.8, rather than the full 5 stars, is that I'm less enthralled by the topics this novel is confected from (infidelity, sports, independent music, birding, ZPG, the evils of the coal industry).
0553801503|1.0|I'm shocked at how little this book has to offer.  Let me sum it up for you....you do not know or care about most of the characters in this book, they are new, boring, not relevant to the story, boring, seem to be shoe-horned into the series for no apparent reason...and did I mention Boring?  Can't tell you what happened in the last quarter of the book, I tossed it!  I rarely fail to finish a book, its an odd twist in my personality, I have to finish!  Could'nt swing it here.  The first 3 are some of the most amazing Fantasy I have ever read, Loved them.  This one is nonsense.  Ill wait for Book 5....but Ill wait till I hear some reader reviews, if its more of the same, I'm sorry to say i'll have to be done with my one of favorite authors.  Just skip this book.....seriously.  \\"Nothin' to see here, keep moving, Nothin to seee!\\"
B003UYUR0G|5.0|Now, this is a movie that deserved better. It is what a true summer blockbuster should be, yet it didn't apparently find an audience. And that's unfair, because this is a pretty entertaining film that keeps you glued to the screen all the way. It has action, romance, humor, and, in the era of special effects, plenty of them.<br /><br />The story begins in the city of Nasaf, when King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), impressed by the streets smarts of a homeless kid by the name of Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), adopts him to become part of the royal family. All is well for many years, until it is revealed that the neighboring and friendly, holy city of Alamut is selling weapons to the enemy. The king's sons - Tus (Richard Coyle), Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Dastan --, together with their uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley), decide to conduct a preemptive strike against Alamut, try to find the weapons, and bring stability to the region. The King, who knew better, was against the invasion, but accepted his family's explanation and supported them. Unfortunately, an accident happens, in which the king dies, and Dastan is blamed for it. He has to escape and run for his life, in order that he can prove his innocence. He is joined by beautiful Queen Tamina (Gemma Arterton), ruler of Alamut, in the quest for the truth. But the truth is bigger that anything Dastan could imagine, and the answer lies on a sacred dagger that the queen carries with her.<br /><br />Based on a video game with the same name, and directed by Mike Newell, \\"Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time,\\" is fun, especially in the scenes involving Sheik Amar (the very versatile Alfred Molina, who steals the film). Of course, you should also expect all the excesses associated with Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the movie. In the end, you will surely understand when they say, at the beginning of the film, that, \\"It is said some lies are linked across time, connected by an ancient calling that echoes through ages.\\" Furthermore, this business about invading another country because of non-existent weapons sounds familiar, doesn't it? Great idea for many more movies. The fantastic Blu-ray edition is loaded with extras, including DVD and digital copies of the film; deleted scene; making-of documentary; and CineExplore, in which you can unlock the secrets behind forty segments.

0439023513|5.0|I'm so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews.  I read the first book and really enjoyed it... not even knowing beforehand that it was a trilogy.  Before I ordered and read the second book, I came here to at least see what the reviews were on it.  When I saw the less than stellar reviews for book 3, I almost decided not to read any more.  Last thing I wanted to do was commit to reading the 2nd book, knowing the ending in book 3 would be disappointing.  I'm glad I ignored the critics and continued reading.  I personally liked the way the series wrapped up.    ********************************************Spoiler Alert  ****************************************************    I would have been very disappointed with a \\"happily ever after\\" ending.  I think that given the things that Kat had to endure, she was lucky to end up with any semblance of a normal life.  In reality, no matter what side someone is fighting for... good or evil, there is a price to pay.  No one escapes the chaos of war without being affected.  I think people who think this became an anti-war propaganda book, may be reading a bit too much into this work of `FICTION'.  I think Collins portrays war pretty well... namely that both sides lose.  I don't see where she ever indicates that it wasn't worth the fight.  The life she portrays that Kat ends up living is certainly better than the one she had before the conflict.  Better for her children.      Bottom line is I think it's certainly worth a read and would be very disappointed if I had quit reading after the first book because of the more negative opinions of some reviewers.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Watching Kat (Julia Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger) interact in this film is priceless. Both characters were given great lines, but it is the combination that makes the film for me. One of my favorite scenes is when Patrick is told that Kat apparently likes \\"pretty guys\\" and his facial expression is hilarious as he finally realizes they don't think he is. Which is he, of course. It eventually dawns on each of the two main characters that they like the other despite no initial intentions to do so. These awakenings are touching to watch. They each publicly embarrass themselves as they travel towards being a couple, but by the end of the movie I'm convinced they have a future. Whether that survives Kat going to Sarah Lawrence for college I can't say, but I'll bet they have a good time together for the rest of their senior year.  This is a movie I can watch over and over again because it is funny and entertaining. It also makes high school look as ridiculous as it is, but yet certainly more fun than my high school years.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|I was a little hesitant about getting this CD after hearing Accept with Dirkshneider but WOW, this is the most powerful metal CD that I had gotten in a long time. Mark Tornillo does an awesome job on vocals and is a great replacement.  Every song rocks on the CD rocks!  Not much else to say but anyone looking for a great metal CD, please check this out!
B000W4HIX6|4.0|I think it was pretty good for a late 80`s film. I think most of the action scenes was good, and i think Bruce Willis plays his character John McClane to perfection. I think it seems like he was made for roles like this.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4/5<br /><br />I think it looks pretty good. I think it looks pretty detailed and such.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 4/5<br /><br />I think the DTS-HD master audio 5.1 was pretty good. The only thing i didn`t like was that i feel the dialog coming out the Center speaker sounds thin and muffled. Too bad they couldn`t or didn`t try to fix that so it would have sounded better. I have seen films who has used the rear speakers more, but in the action scenes they was used for good effect. Like some gunshots, helicopter and other effects.<br /><br />The bass from most of the gunshot effects sounded good to me. I was glad they sounded good, since i feared they sounded thin and bass-less, according to the reviews here. John`s unarmed fight against one of German`s, i think had surprisingly good bass when they hit and kicked each other. Great.<br /><br />Film:4/5<br />Overall:4/5
B003PGNBNO|4.0|My kids and I get a kick out of how things are promoted and advertised, especially on TV. My wife and I are big on media literacy, since kids are exposed to advertising almost as soon as they're born.<br /><br />Anyway, whenever a sequel to something approaches, the marketing department types tend to force \\"points\\" into things whether they fit or not. In the case of Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, their \\"strategy\\" was to make it clear that the second film is bigger and better. It's not exactly groundbreaking thinking, but you hear it all the time. So for the last several months Disney Channel has been having their stars tells us how this new Camp Rock is \\"so much more (insert word here).\\" My kids laugh at this because of how it infers that that original is somehow inferior.<br /><br />Of course, that's what advertising types must do -- always go for the new and improved. Curiously, Camp Rock 2 seemed to me to be better than the first film -- but not so to my kids.<br /><br />I liked the big, exuberant musical numbers. Clearly this film feels the influence of past phenoms like High School Musical and Glee. There's a lot more highly choreographed set pieces here and it's great stuff if you like MGM musicals and Annette movies, which of course I do. The songs are more classic Hollywood \\"out of nowhere\\" than in the first film, where they were confined primarily to onstage settings.<br /><br />My kids like musicals too, but they were missing the gentle, simple story of the first Camp Rock. It was basically a cross between Cinderella (a prince seeking a voice rather than a shoe) and the Mickey Mouse Club \\"Annette\\" serial (mean girl accuses nice girl of stealing).<br /><br />The new movie really is bigger. All three Jonas Brothers have key roles this time around, with the most endearing song sung by Nick. Daniel Fathers as the camp leader is more of a plot focus also, as he competes with a rival camp led by an old rock rival (played by Daniel Kash, an actor whom we were sure was related to Tony Shalhoub in look and voice and still, we think, must be a distant cousin).<br /><br />Therein may have been what lost my daughter in particular. The story was about ambition and business rather than boy meets girl -- or at least the romance took a backseat to the main plot. Don't get me wrong -- she likes the film and watched it again but prefers the first one.<br /><br />The one thing we all agree on is the talent and likability of the star, Demi Lovato. She had to carry the first film on her shoulders and delivers a strong presence and performance again. She has a Sally Field quality and we hope she takes her life and career in the best possible dircctions. She's the real deal and we wish her well in the mine field of being a young star in show business.<br /><br />The DVD does not offer more than a sing along (excuse me, a \\"rock along\\") option. The Blu-Ray disc also includes interviews.voice and still, we think, must be a distant cousin).    Therein may have been what lost my daughter in particular.

B000EOTTV8|5.0|This film was worth it due to the great acting of Kevin Zegers and Felicity Huffman. I saw it on cable television and I immediately went and purchased the film. I thought the subject matter was interesting as well and the interesting take of the issue. I also thought that it was liberating to see a film that was not stereotypical or campy. It was straight forward but it had funny moments. I could tell Kevin did a lot of work researching this role.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|Having remembered this fondly from years gone by I was surprised how well it still stands up- The Computer graphics are of course dated and bring a smile to my face but that aside I am happy with everything about this purchase.  The Blu ray quality is good probably as good as it can get its a 7/10 for PQ  and a 9/10 for the film. If you are an 1980's alien bashing starfighter then snap this up.( plays in UK Blu Ray also )  Billy
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  There are so many great truths in it, written in a no-nonsense way.  It's entertaining, moving, funny, sad and witty.  I wrote so many notes, underlined so many lines and have now passed it along to my best friends.  I can't say enough about it.
0374158460|5.0|This is a remarkable, transporting book, one that combines the suspense and compulsive readability of a thriller or other type of pop fiction with the beautiful writing and heavy lifting of ideas that define great art. Books like this come along rarely. Who cares about the hype? Read the book for yourself. I found it a completely transporting experience.
B003C1SPX8|2.0|I expected the video quality to be much higher since this is a DVD version with a product description that said \\"Restored to pristine high definition visual clarity...\\". If you believe that, you will be highly disappointed.

B003VSVWA0|4.0|This CD/DVD comprises footage from around the world during the first two years of Cohen's monster 2008-10 tour, and it makes a welcome sequel to &#34;Live in London,&#34; which was a great show filmed at the beginning. The DVD has a nice bonus feature of over 20 minutes of backstage footage, and it's fun to have a peek behind the curtain--a rarity for this tour. On that note, one may wish for a sequel to a different Cohen tour picture, &#34;Bird on a Wire,&#34; to give us more of a documentary approach. This is not that, nor is it meant to be.  The only quibbles I can imagine will be strictly subjective; in my case, at the show I saw outside Baltimore, I thought I remembered the audience being mesmerized by a stark, solo &#34;Famous Blue Raincoat,&#34; but it's a fuller band arrangement here. But, big deal. Everything here is worthy, especially for Cohen enthusiasts. Cohen's warm reception by the young crowd at Coachella might be the most moving moment of the whole collection.  And let's not overlook what a generous package this is: a CD and matching DVD under one cover, the songs brilliantly recorded and edited into a seamless whole, with an excellent set of insightful liner notes.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant is a lover of American and British roots music. He's been taking excursions into it all the way from 1965, when he assembled his first psychedelic blues group, Band of Joy, to his heavy metal Led Zeppelin days, to his recent recording and touring with bluegrass great Alison Krauss. But he's never hewn to a straight or conventional approach, always adapting the music to his uses, playing with melodies, harmonies, instruments, and vocals in an effort to construct a unique sound.<br /><br />Plant is still at it in this album of covers from a wide variety of sources. I love the results, and I think you will, too. His new group resurrects the name \\"Band of Joy,\\" and it has a very fuzzy, atmospheric sound. His opening covers of songs by Los Lobos and Richard Thompson reveal two of his influences. Since I'm a huge fan of both, as well as of two members of Plant's band -- Patty Griffin and Buddy Miller -- there was no doubt in my mind that I would enjoy this new outing. It's very hard to stir that much inspiration and talent together and not come up with something delicious.<br /><br />And delicious it is. Every song is played and sung with a rocker's passion and a gospel singer's commitment. It's honest music infused with folk traditions, yet the heavy bass and electric guitars never let you forget that this is a thoroughly modern album. At 62, Plant brings a lifetime's worth of experience and creativity to the project, but his voice has lost none of the vibrant qualities it had when he was a young man. \\"Band of Joy\\" is the perfect title: it makes me happy!

B002ZG98UA|1.0|Now I like the RE series. So much so that I've played the games and watched the movies multiple times. So I decided to go to the midnight premier of the newest installment in the RE franchise. Upon entering the theater I was met by ecstatic fans. So naturally my excitement rose. About forty minutes later the lights dimmed and we held our breath as the movie began. What we were treated to was unfortunately the worst RE yet. The story picks up right where the third one left off.<br /><br />*Spoilers* After Alice and her clones take their revenge on the Umbrella facility in Tokyo, Alice makes her way to the fabled sanctuary known as Arcadia. Upon arriving at the supposed location of this safe haven, she discovers Claire Redfield, of course burdened with the classic cliche: amnesia. So she has no way of remembering what happened to the rest of the party that Alice had sent there in RE Extinction. Fearing that they are the last humans, they make their way to Los Angeles. Because that's exactly where you should go during a zombie apocalypse, a LARGE CITY! In LA they find a whole horde of zombies. SHOCKING! There also happens to be a small band of survivors surviving in a prison. Again, SHOCKING! Alice MUST help these people get to Arcadia. Why? Who knows?! Or cares?! The farther along the movie went, the more I realized that I was not one of the few people who did. The movie was nothing more than action sequences tethered together by nothingness. Most of the new characters were completely worthless and only served as fodder for the zombie hordes. Now I know the RE series is not looking for an Oscar but really, a little more effort from the actors and the screenwriters to develop the characters might have made me care a little more. Actually I doubt it. These characters have gotten boring! The action scenes were half decent but even those were ruined. The huge killer? SLOW-MOTION! I wanted to rip my hair out! A great action scene is instantly killed with unnecessary 2min slow-motion. Alice jumps off a building -> slow-motion. Someone throws a gun to Alice -> slow-motion. Claire takes out a zombie boss -> slow-motion. Alice picks her nose -> slow-motion! Totally killed the pacing and excitement. Another major pace killer? The editing! The movie is absolutely filled with useless shots. For instance: more often than not we'll get a birds eye view of the area and Alice's location. Yes, we get it, she's being tracked! A little gripe out of the many shots, but little things like that really accumulate.<br /><br />Now Afterlife did have a few shining moments. The 3D was actually spectacular! It really helped with the depth of the movie, particularly with the flying scenes and the zombie battles. Was it a gimmick? A big emphatic HELL YES! Everything from knives, bullets, blood, guns, zombies, and giant axes were thrown at the viewer. While it was a bit much at times, it was still awesome! Apart from the 3D, seeing The Executioner made me as giddy as a school girl. He was freaking amazing. Unfortunately, he and the \\"new\\" zombies are never explained in the movies, which only leads to confusion. While the end of RE Afterlife leaves room for a sequel, \\"this\\" RE universe in no way deserves another one. The best way to continue the RE movies is IMO by completely rebooting it.

B00005YU1O|3.0|First of all this film as an art film has captured my attention but what initially prompted me to buy it was the subject of lucid dreaming. This is movie is the best in portraying lucid dreaming's elements. About the discussions and philosophy of it, i don't buy it full through, i like some philosophies such as the 'ant' one, the 'boatcar' one,the 'dream chapel' one, and perphaps the 'holy moment', but overall though i like the tone of the film, but now being a christian who has found the truth-namely CHRIST-this film doesn't leave me anywhere really (with its philosophy) beyond where i am, but of course this is not a christian-tone film. But still one can retain the good and leave out the rest(paraphrasying) as St.Paul would say.

A 45 minute errand turned into a three hour meltdown after mixed up directions and crossed wires created the airport pickup from hell.<br /><br />And this book is one last, sad remnant of that horrible day.  I can not even get started.  Swedish names, complex back stories and talk of paying fines in kronor and spending time in gaol don't make for an interesting story.  I'm not even going to hang in there for the rape scenes.  No thanks.
B001CDLATE|2.0|- Archaic religious practices look great in HD  - Religious buildings, churches and ruins look great in HD  - Meditating monks look great in HD  - Half burnt corpses look great in HD  - Oil well fires look great in HD  - The ravages of war look great in HD  What is the bloody point?    Taken at face value, this random compilation of scenes from all over the world is beautiful, but ultimately a pointless waste of time. The film makers are wasting excellent footage in spreading their childish, simplified message: Modern way of living is bad - ancient beliefs and nonsensical behaviour is good. A most dubious message, especially when delivered by people who utilise all sorts of modern technological gadgets in creating their movie (advanced cameras, computers, scanners, helicopters, jet planes, etc.)     Bending over backwards for (in this case Eastern) religious nonsense is not a helpful act for the future of this planet. It only makes you more ignorant of the problems and their possible solutions.     Why didn't the team behind this mess try to tell some of the stories that are hidden below the eye candy? There are so many interesting angles, so many conflicting views and interests to illuminate:   - Why were the temples of Cambodia abandoned for hundreds of years?  - Why is the rain forest being felled in South America, and how can this be countered?  - How our early civilisations relied on the timber industry to the extend, that most of the forest in western countries were felled?  - Why some people in India (the untouchables) are forced to live on (and off) the rubbish dumps? (It is not a technological problem but a religious/social problem).  - How religious observance make old ladies rinse their dentures in the very same water that other people wash in, urinate in and discard charred body parts in; and why this is a problem for hygiene.   - What constitutes a humane treatment of animals?  - Etc., etc.    May I recommend, as a substitute, the quite similar but muchmore persuasive movie \\"Home\\" by Yann Arthus-Bertrand. It has a voice-over and presents a very clear message, through pictures and words, that we humans have to change our ways. It is NOT helpful to sit back and await divine intervention while enjoying this eye candy on your HD TV.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|After four wonderful seasons Showtime's \\"The Tudors\\" wrapped up production in early 2010. Now on November 23, 2010 we can enjoy one of the most visually perfect television productions of all-time in a complete series box set. This set will included all 38 episodes along with an array of bonus features that were never available on the individual season sets.<br /><br /> Most critics have stated what a wonderful series \\"The Tudors\\" was, with everything from the acting, to the excellent scripts, to the fabulous costumes being at the top of their game. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers did a remarkable job in the role of King Henry VIII bringing both a strength and crediblity in his performances as week after week we watched as Henry would do anything for his country while at the same time trying to bed every young woman he could.<br /><br /> \\"The Tudors\\" follwed King Henry's life as King of England where he married multiple times and had various lovers, had dastardly political doings that were not favored by many, and he single handedly brought down the Roman Catholic Church.<br /><br /> In this 15 disc set the extra bonuses will include the following:<br /><br />1. Hirst's Castle<br />2. Reviving History<br />3. Royal Manners<br />4. Poetic Licence<br />5. Henry's Wives Club<br />6. History of the Tudor Rose<br />7. Medieval Arms<br />8. Tracking The Tudor Dynasty<br />9. Wheel of Misfortune<br />10. Deleted Scenes<br />11. Bloopers<br />12. Tudors 500th Anniversary:Hampton Court<br />13. Tudors 500th Anniversary:Tower of London<br />14. Tudors 500th Anniversary:British Library
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This is a great series that seemed to combine the books in a condensed great manner, would also recommend the book series.
0307455874|4.0|I agree with one of the other \\"conservative\\" reviewers of this book:  This is a MUST read, if for no other reason than to gain an understanding of what makes one of the most influential people in American politics \\"tick\\", so to speak.  While I must say that reading this book did nothing to change my mind about President Obama as either a candidate (back when the book was written) and now as the Leader of the Free World, it was good to also see that we share some \\"common ground\\", although our approaches to some of these commonalities would be far different.  For those \\"independents\\" that voted for President Obama in 2008, I think this should be mandatory reading...because I truly believe the vote would change back to the GOP, if they simply read what he has said in many cases, and what he has actually done.<br /><br />I find that in several cases, I am troubled by an inherent hypocrisy that I see with President Obama.  I'll give a few key examples below:<br /><br />1.  He freely admits meeting with several \\"rich\\" donors during his startling burst onto the National scene during his US Senate run....and he indicates that many of these people have concerns about organized labor, affirmative action, tax policies (with the apparent exception of Warren Buffet, which he makes abundantly clear) and other significant issues.  And yet, while willing to take their money...he is willing to simply ignore their concerns to continue to garner votes from unions, minorities, etc.  Seems to me that it is okay to take their money...but to then ignore them on the campaign trail when he makes promises that simply go in the complete opposite direction.  I guess it is just easier to go to a $10,000/plate dinner, than it is to raise $25.00 donations from every one of those union members, isn't it?<br /><br />2.  I think President Obama plays \\"fast and free\\" with respect to his Faith.  He makes no bones about how his mother had no real adherence to any specific religion:  Christian, Muslim, etc.  Furthermore, he makes it VERY clear that religion played absolutely no role in his life through college and into his early working career.  Therefore, as a reader (and as a Conservative that voted against him), I find it troubling to see that he \\"found\\" religion, only when he wanted to find his way into politics.  Now, those on the Left will argue that G.W. Bush did the same...but I disagree.  Bush wore religion as a badge of honor, and made no bones about being \\"reborn in Christ\\" as he claims.  The wearing of the religious mantle on the part of President Obama is much more cynical and troubling to me.  It is CLEARLY a play to get away from being an atheist (which I believe he is more so than I believe he is a Muslim, like many mis-informed Americans)..because he knows that being an atheist would cause him a BIG problem with all of those hard-working, blue collar, CATHOLIC Democrats that he needs so much to win ANY sort of National race.  But, let me assure you, this man has no love of God, or any higher power.  I simply do not believe, in any way, shape or form that he \\"submitted (himself) to His will, and dedicated (himself) to discovering His truth.\\"  Bottom line:  He doesn't believe in God.<br /><br />3.  I find it troublesome that he praises President Lincoln for basically standing on \\"conviction\\" (his words, not mine) when it came to taking on the South over slavery, and that \\"we should pursue our own absolute truths only if we acknowledge that there may be a terrible price to pay.\\"  Apparently, in my cynical view (as those on the Left reading this will certainly claim), that applies only when helping people that are NOT Caucasian(?).  For, if this were really true...then he should have far more in common with George W. Bush, as well.  President Bush (and his father before him, and President Clinton) were forced for years to sit back and watch an ineffective UN try to curb Saddam Hussein's adamant refusal to simply allow for inspections:  Inspections, mind each of you that think the invasion of Iraq was a BAD idea (like President Obama), that would have simply PROVED he had no WMDs, and would have ultimately resulted in the avoidance of hostilities with the U.S.A.!!!  The fact that President Bush FAITHFULLY believed that Saddam represented a threat to the U.S.A. just as President Lincoln's FAITH led him to the similarly \\"war-mongering\\" (according to anyone from the South, at the time, and perhaps even until today?) posture that he took back in the 1860s!  C'mon folks...can you honestly still buy what this guy is trying to sell us.<br /><br />4.  Although this has always been a problem of mine with President Obama, he makes NO BONES about his belief in a \\"redistribution\\" of wealth.  Something I find utterly abhorrent.  Listen up, \\"independents\\"...there is a reason we have grades in school, there is a reason there are SAT, GMAT, LSAT and other tests, there  are reasons for profesional certification exams: CPA, Bar Exam, Medical Boards, etc....it is to \\"rank us\\"; colleges use such rankings to pick their students, employers use those rankings to make initial hiring decisions, promotions, transfers, etc.  So, what \\"right\\" does this man have in then tearing down the very basic concepts that made this nation great to simply go after the \\"top 2%\\" of earners in the hopes of redistributing wealth?  I would argue that if we simply divided up ALL wealth in the world among every inhabitant on the planet, that within a span of 10-20 years, the SAME 2% would AGAIN control / have the bulk of the world's wealth, with a few exceptions of those that simply don't get the chance to succeed because they lack money now, etc....but, overall, I truly believe that my \\"social experiment\\" would win out.<br /><br />5.  He summarily discounts the views of soldiers (and even his all-loving reporter friends) on the ground with respect to the Iraq conflict.  Because he didn't want us to be there, he doesn't want to give credit to the views of many of the \\"boots on the ground\\", that American presence there was / is making a difference...FOR THE BETTER.  It is not all about IED's and Sunni/Shi'ite violence.  I think he gives this entire \\"debate\\" about ONE PARAGRAPH in a 360+ page book!  Why?  Simply because he does not want to give President Bush (or those of us that backed Bush) any credit for ultimately being responsible for a great change, (freeing more people than Lincoln's freed slaves, by the way) thus justifying the invasion of Iraq at all.  And he only touches on what he believes to be a misguided effort in Afghanistan...and, as we now see in his handling of that particular theatre of operations:  He really doesn't have a \\"good\\" answer either, does he?  So, are the lives lost in Afghanistan worth more or less in his eyes than those that made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq?  As a former serviceman myself, I would LOVE to have that discussion with him.<br /><br />6.  His utter disdain for the GOP-controlled Congress and their \\"strong arm\\" tactics while they held the Legislative Branch majority.  And yet, as we have seen since he has been in office...he is not afraid (at all) of yielding to tactics that would make the Chicago MOB cower in fear to get things passed like HealthCare Reform (which 60% of Americans despise), etc.<br /><br />I could go on and on...but I think I would simply end up regurgitating this entire book.  But, if I succeed in attracting the attention of only ONE \\"independent\\" voter who has not read this book, and is concerned about the direction this country is taking under the leadership of this particular President, then I will consider myself to have been effective.<br /><br />Good luck, and GOD Bless.vasion of Iraq was a BAD idea (like President Obama), that would have simply PROVED he had no WMDs, and would have ultimately resulted in the avoidance of hostilities with the U.S.A.!!!

B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I can't believe this movie has really been out for more than 25 years!  It is still as fresh and funny as the first time I saw it.  Marvelous performances by great actors (Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Sidney Pollack and others).  I have to say that this performance is one of Dustin Hoffman's best of his career.  He was absolutely outstanding - so believable and vulnerable.  It must have been a difficult character to play but he totally nailed it.  This is still one of my all time favorite movies.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|This film tells a story about a young beautiful girl who seems to have become immune to love, wrapped up in her imagination of being a chamelon to those who would become clients in her world of selling her self. Living out the fantasy of another. She is young and comes across this way in her actions and her speech. She is not really manifesting sexuality in her movements and energy but she is interesting and her character draws you in as well as her physical appearance. She meets a female gynocologist who lives a life of seeming apartness from her husband and son. The two ladies share an intimate moment in a restaurant bathroom. Their connection is brief but feels pronounced. It is a different coming together not, a normal interaction, so each can remember its taking place. The doctor is played by Moore, who is again a lonely beautiful woman who doesn't reflect much joy in life. She loves her husband who is played by Neeson, who comes across the opposite in his dealings with others. He is jovial and playful in his career of college professor. His students find him appealing and want to bring him down to their level and he abides. The film starts right in showing the insecurity of the wife towards her mate's flirtations and lateness from work. The strife builds as her insecurity becomes an obsession. An obsession that involves the lovely girl who she meets and continues to find encounters, paying her to come on to Neeson to see how he responds. Throughout this somewhat twisty tale the two women find a sexual tie in the hearing of how her hubby takes the bait with Chole. The tension and restraint of the affair is so well portrayed by Moore. Chole displays flat affect but it is a cover for large insecurity which is seen at the end of the film. Neeson's part also grapples with emotion, we see him as a fun loving personality yet at home he seems wracked with distance from his family. The lack of intimacy between them leads to the sexual acting out. I love Atom E. he is such a great storyteller and chooses material that draws you in. If you have a chance see the movie The Sweet Hereafter, it is one of the best films I have seen. The things I liked in this film, I loved the clothes and the style of the young girl, I liked how she used her imagination, I liked the city where they lived, it rang with fun, I liked the greenhouse and all the places available to sightsee, and I liked the coffeehouses that were all over, used as meeting place for clandestine conversations.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|This movie is such a powerful and emotional piece of history. You immediately become invested in it. It's quite lengthy, but while watching it you don't even realize, in fact you come out wanting more. It's a shame this movie only came out in a VERY limited release in theaters (political reasons). The acting is wonderful, very believable, the actors draw you in. I'm curious to find out if Rachel Weisz won any awards for her performance, would be very well deserved. As some other reviewers stated, the sets are just stunning. It feels very real. But, all in all, its the story that blows you away, very powerful (prepare yourself, you will cry).<br /><br />This movie I'm sure is set to win a whole slew of awards. Amazing piece of cinema!

B003V5PPZG|5.0|Everyone who doesn't like this album needs to realize that if Linkin Park never changed their sound, they would end up like Nickelback where every song sounds the same. Everyone would be complaining if Linkin Park kept putting out Hybrid Theory and Meteora quality material because it might all start to sound the same.
B003UYUR10|3.0|Behold! From the foul stenches of the forgotten genre of time, comes a rollicking fun Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, a modern CG-filled throwback to those silly Italian sword-and-sandal epics. A deceiving uncle; a man of destiny; a princess who is more than her looks; sword fights and across the desert adventures; yes, we've seen this all before, and better, but that doesn't stop the enjoyment of Prince of Persia. It's a film so keen on non-stop action, that it's entertaining in just that regard. It's brainless entertainment, a fun movie just like the promise of many on a hot summer day, that even in the chilly air conditioned theater, we rarely get. For that, we won't mind the film's flaws.<br /><br />Don't get too hyped up based on my early praise. The film is rather standard, following Bruckheimer's own Pirates of the Caribbean films closely, and it all whizzes by in predictable fashion. But the first key to enjoying this film is getting by the non-Middle Eastern actors. Once you can buy the fact that you cannot have no-name Iranian actors as leads in a $150 million budgeted film, following a game Jake Gyllenhaal isn't all that bad. True, this is the 6th Century in Persia (now Iran), but hey, the Persian King rescues a young, English boy who has a noble heart, so let's roll with that. Once you do, the rest of the film is pound-for-pound pleasing as any other film of its ilk.<br /><br />Throughout all of the big special effect sequences, the glue to the film is the fine cast Bruckheimer has rounded up, much like his own Pirates franchise, this is a team effort. Gyllenhaal is fine here; well-toned and lively, but he's far better when he is verbally sparing with the increasing cute Gemma Arterton, as much of their banter is a greatly played. Of course, Sir Ben Kingsley is walking through this, but that doesn't stop him from even phoning in a solid performance as the baddie. To the film's delight, is Alfred Molina as the Sheik Amar. He's hammy and over-the-top, but he gets the tone of the film and is having fun with it all, like the audience. Have I told you about...yes, you have Molina, but tell us again.<br /><br />Don't sweat it if you enjoy it all, even if the plot is loosely fitted together with all of that sword-and-sandal hokum. It's a jazzed up version of those, as only mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer can deliver in the summer months. It's entertaining, yet somewhat easily dismissible. It's everything some people love about popcorn movies and everything other people hate about popcorn movies. After you lick your fingers from the greasy popcorn, did you even consider that the film was adapted from a video game?tone of the film and is having fun with it all, like the audience.

0312330537|4.0|Incredible story with vivid detail and characters.  The author's stylistic devices and word choice can become repetitive in the 900+ pages, but the color of the tale makes this an amazing read that will certainly stay with you.  The narrator does also come across as a bit self-promoting.  Self-deprecation is quickly accepted, but it is just as readily dismissed as if it were trivial.
B003K025TQ|2.0|This cd is a mess.  It is all over the place.  It has more genre's than there are holes in swiss cheese.  All these songs are good and have a place somewhere, but not on an album under the title of \\"Lee Ritenour\\".  This is a collection of people and tunes that do not belong together.  I might as well have my stereo on random play as listen to this.  I do not get all the 5 stars, other than previously mentioned, that all the songs are good.  It is not a Lee Ritenour album and if you buy this thinking that, like I did, you will be very disappointed.  I like and respect Mr. Ritnours's work and was expecting a lot more than this when I purchased this cd.
B00338QELU|1.0|Great start - and great disappointment afterwards. The story turns very political, with unfortunately clear \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" Chinese people, multiple sections in favor of Mao (which was not even the then official party line - I lived in China at the time), Mugabe \\"maybe a tyrant, but maybe a liberator\\" (excuse me, Mugabe???). I stopped and deleted the book at this point - too much annoyingly obvious political messages, badly written and the explosive start of the beginning completely buried. Waste of time - worse than the waste of money.

B0038P9LTU|5.0|Ignorance is the seed from which harshly negative reviews spawn from.  Let's ponder this for a minute before we discuss the album at hand.  To do so, we need to reach as far back to a band's conception.  Bands are composed of people, in particular, unique people with their own voices and opinions.  They have chosen to use music as a means to communicate their ideas, and, in turn, albums are created.  We're listeners - also people with our own voices and opinions.  The difference between us and them is that they write what they want to and we choose what we listen to based on what we like to hear.      Rhapsody [of Fire] is a band composed of people like any other.  Its members (particularly main contributors, Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli) share ideas in ways that may come across as unconventional or non-traditional to some, but by no means is it sub-standard.  If anything, Rhapsody has gained the appreciation they have from fans over the years for going above and beyond the call of duty in ways few others have.  Rhapsody was actually my 5th metal band in 2002 and my first album was the at-the-time new Power of the Dragonflame.  I then picked up Symphony of Enchanted Lands and both of the Luca Turilli solo albums before getting myself the The Dark Secret EP + DVD in 2004 that previewed the new saga and the inclusion of Christopher Lee as one of the characters.  If ever you want further clarification/elaboration on the band's idea of their expression of - I will again use these words - their voices and opinions, I refer you to watch the 20-or-so-minute documentary on the album.  Several band members (as well as Christopher Lee himself, who calls the band \\"one of the most popular in the world\\") speak about the band and the then-upcoming Symphony of Enchanted Lands, Part II album:  the addition of the orchestra, the ##-piece (can't remember the exact #) choir, and more.  What struck me the most and has made me forever view Rhapsody [of Fire] in a different way is theway one of the members (can't remember who) says, when referring to the then-upcoming album, \\"it's everything but the movie.\\"  Think about that.  This is what I've been building up the last two paragraphs for.  Do Helloween, Gamma Ray, Nightwish, Labyrinth, Dark Moor, Stratovarius (my favorite band, I might add), Hammerfall, Edguy, Manowar, Sonata Arctica, or Primal Fear do this?  No.  Oh, sure - for brief moments we'll have, for example, Iced Earth's 32-minute Gettysburg video (which is unbelievable and a history lesson in its own way - don't get me wrong).  But again and again and again?  No.  This is what Rhapsody does.  This is what they want to do.  We're the listeners.  If we don't like it, we should be fair enough to look elsewhere for what we want.      Now - and only now - that we have a mutual understanding of Rhapsody of Fire can we begin to discuss their latest album, The Frozen Tears of Angels.  First, the objectives:  3rd album of the new saga and since addition of Christopher Lee and the orchestra, debut album with Nuclear Blast (who is notorious for... well... I can't say that in the \\"objective\\" section), 7th overall (8th if you count thousand flames), and first album in four years.  So the question of \\"What are they going to give us this time?\\" surely comes to mind.  (That's about it for the objective stuff; music is, after all, a subjective thing, isn't it?  If you disagree, reread the first two paragraphs.)      I remember back in May or so of this year watching a youtube promo for the new album and remember saying to myself \\"Woah!  Rhapsody is back!\\" because everything I had heard since 2004 (The Dark Secret and Triumph or Agony - sadly, I've never heard anything else off of Symphony II other than The Magic of the Wizard's Dream and whatever songs they played when I saw them live in 2005 with Manowar and HolyHell) was far harder to enjoy.  Everything that made Rhapsody epic and practically theatrical was there, but there was almost +too+ much ofthat.  One slow song after another and minimal signature Luca Turilli guitar leads/solos served as turn-offs for me (and others, as well).  It's hard to describe what I love about Rhapsody to someone who's never really understood them:  it's fun as hell, but never cheesy.  The person who says \\"Rhapsody [of Fire]\\" is just cheesy power metal about elves and dwarves\\" is one of the most... use your imagination.  (Again - if you have a problem with this, reread the first two paragraphs.)  That claim would be ignorant on many accounts.  Rhapsody [of Fire] fits into power metal because it can't just have its own genre just for it (and maybe Fairyland, if that satisfies some of my readers), but by no means can someone expect to hear what they have come to know \\"power metal\\" to be when listening to Rhapsody.  There's waaaaaaaay more than power metal going on here.  Spoken parts, full songs in Italian, the choir, the orchestra, but more importantly than anything is the story.  Since I haven't heard every single Rhapsody album, I'm not going to comment +too+ much on it (`cause I'd be ignorant to do so).  But I can say that the story is, as always, far more detailed than what you'd expect in epic metal.  Few other bands I'm aware of even have these multi-album sagas going on in their back-catalog.  I know Skylark does (at least 1997-2007, but I don't know if the new album will feature our favorite Princess of the Snow character once more), and other bands (ex. Avantasia, Fairyland) will do a couple albums, while still others will do single albums with advanced stories (these are all over the place).  What I'm trying to say is that when you're buying a Rhapsody [of Fire] album, you are getting way more than just 55-75 minutes of music.  Like I quoted from the DVD, \\"its everything but the movie.\\"      Some of you are just dying by now wondering when - if ever - I am actually going to talk about the musical content on The Frozen Tears of Angels.  Ok, I'll comply.  Wonderful intro.  Merge Lux Triumphans or In Tenebris or To Magic Horizons with sci-fi/fantasy/action-thriller movie trailers music (the Mozart Dies Irae type) and you've got Dark Frozen World.  I much prefer this to the too-extensive, 3:13 Dar Kunor intro of the previous album.  Rhapsody of Fire then does something a little out of the ordinary.  Recall past Rhapsody and Luca Turilli albums.  Singles often don't appear until late on the albums.  Demonheart, in particular, occurs as late as track 8 out of 10 on Prophet of the Last Eclipse.  But on The Frozen Tears of Angels, our single, Sea of Fate, awaits us to greet us at the gate.  On top of that, its pace strikes me as, \\"Hm... a power metal album opening without one of its fast numbers?  The best I've ever seen this pulled off is on Lost Horizon's `Flame to the Ground Beneath'.\\"  But its fine.  Perhaps Luca and Alex felt they needed to show us they were for real with the return to a more metal and less theatrical musical style.  I'm sold.  The second single appears at track 4 and is one of three songs featuring some blazing-fast music.  And we're talking like Knightrider of Doom speed.      I'm not going to turn the review into a song-by-song analysis.  But if you're reading this review trying to determine whether or not you want to purchase the CD, it's 1) a \\"must\\" for a Rhapsody fan, 2) a \\"should\\" for a seasoned power metal fan (when \\"power metal\\" does +not+ refer to the last few Edguy albums), and 3) for everyone else, another fine example of a band going well beyond the call of duty in terms of its means of expressing - one last time - unique voices and opinions.      I do realize this has been quite a lengthy review and I apologize for anyone who had the oven on, but there's a lot to say about a band who has a lot to say, you know?

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This bag can hold LOTS of photo equipment and still not make the wearer feel like a beast of burden.  Once full, it distributes the weight evenly, unlike some shoulder strap or sling bags.  I fit a Pentax K20D with 18-55mm lens attached, Tamron 70-300mm, Tamron 28-70mm, Pentax 10-17mm Fisheye, Pentax 28-105mm lenses, Pentax AF 360 Flash unit in the interior easily, plus storing various filters, cables, extra batteries and memory cards in the front and side pockets.      There are numerous interior dividers that are easily reorganized for a customized fit, details, such as side holders for a tripod, side gusseted pocket and rubberized zipper pulls that make for easy gripping and zipping.    The shoulder straps are nicely padded, as is the back of the bag.  Length of straps is adjustable as is the waist belt.  My only complaint with the bag is that despite all the adjustments, it still was not as comfortable for a wearer with broader shoulders and a little more endowment in the chest...the straps seemed too close and the across the chest strap just couldn't be made less confining.  A smaller person trying it on had no such problems.      Finding the perfect camera bag is a challenging task...finding that combination of carrying capacity, good weight distribution and fit for the wearer can be problematic.  This bag will be a great bag for those who:    1. Want to carry all their camera gear - the capacity of this bag is one of its strengths.    2. Need a comfortable bag for a lengthy trek - the backpack style and waistband will keep it in place and secure for the lengthiest hike without shoulder strain. It will not be as convenient for those who need frequent access to change out gear.    3. Are small to average-sized individuals - for those who have broad shoulders, this bag may not be as comfortable.    4. Finally, price - Amazon is selling a quality camera bag for considerably less than many of the major \\"name\\" bags companies.  Bravo, Amazon.
0807014265|5.0|I have to admit that I heard about this book very recently. I was introduced to this book while I was reading Dr. Francis Collins's collection of essays \\"Belief\\".<br />Dr.Frankl's essay from that collection struck me as one of the deepest and most meaningful one.<br />At that moment I decided to read the book. The book is worth the money with just the introduction, throughout the book you really feel like talking to the person himself on a winter night by the fire place.<br />As a person who was partially faced with similar decisions (having to leave the parents and spending part of my life time under oppression), I found this book very touching.<br />I wish every high school student read this book, this way they may take fewer things for granted.<br />The value of the book does't consist only in the excellent narrative style but also on the psychological depth.<br />Definitely one of the best books I've ever read.

B003XL6EKS|5.0|By now most fans know the story. After many years on tour the other Killers needed a long vacation; Brandon however didn't. This album was never about establishing a proper solo career. It's simply the work of an artist who loves making music, and wanted to continue refining his craft. Many reviewers in the press have criticized Flamingo for not being different enough from The Killers. As I say regarding all Killers records, please don't compare them against each other, each is a seperate work with its own beauty and merits.    With that said, Flamingo is a solid effort from start to finish. Though Flamingo has many similarities with the Killers, there's also notable departures. Of course it's much more subdued, less bombastic absent the other bandmates great guitars and drums. It's also at times more mainstream, less alternative without those selfsame guitars and drums. But what Flamingo does have is Brandon Flowers unique talent as a singer and songwriter. This is probably most evident on songs like 'Crossfire', where who else could sing about the \\"crossfire between heaven and hell\\" with a simple, yet meaningful, mellifluous chorus of \\"lay your body down, lay your body down, lay your body down...\\" The lyricism continues prominently in songs Was it Something I Said, Magdalena, Playing with Fire, where Brandon weaves talented vocals with strong storytelling. The best melodies come in \\"Only the Young\\" and \\"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\\", two songs that should be singles releases. Flamingo also has some more personal, dustier experimentation. Tracks like \\"On the Floor\\" (a gospel track akin to early Elvis) and \\"Swallow It\\" (with its funky introspection). There is a distinct duet with female singer Jenny Lewis on \\"Hard Enough\\", which could also be a single, and of course the glitzy intro \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\". The three producers lends a lot of variation within Flamingo; from dusty, to dancefloor modern, to in between; giving the album a feel that it's all over the place, yet still of high quality and always personal. Taken on its own merits, the record presents a full journey and only gets better with multiple listens.    Flamingo can be somewhat of a slow-grower, but there really is not a bad track here. I would recommend it to most Killers fans, and anyone who likes Brandon Flowers. Listen to a few of the live performances on youtube if you need to get a feel. Also for those getting the album, I would highly recommend the \\"deluxe edition\\" as it's only a little more, but bears some excellent additional tracks.
030726999X|3.0|If you have read the first two books of the millenium trilogy, then you HAVE to read this book.  The ending is what makes it worth while but the rest of the book DRAAAAGS.  I won't say I was disappointed because I truly love Stieg Larson's work but there were many times that I had to force myself to pick up the book.  When I finished The Girl Who Played with Fire, I instantly ran out to buy The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest because I couldn;t live a second without reading more about what happened to Salander.  It took me almost 200 pages to get into the story and there were so many characters involved that the book became confusing and boring at points.  There were parts where I had to force myself to keep reading but there were also scenes that were gripping.  One thing that amazes me is Stieg Larson's ability to make characters come to life.  I'm so bummed the trilogy is over because I'm going to miss Salander, Berger, and Mikael. Overall, I recommend the book but I don't think it was as good as the previous two.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I have been watching Grey's since the beginning, and there are some awesome episodes.  But nothing compares to the finale last season.  It is one gripping two hours of television that you don't want to miss out on.  The season overall is good, and has it's definite highlights; but nothing compares to the season 6 finale. Spoilers ahead...  The season starts with George's death, and later in the season Izzie leaves.  It feels somewhat strange at first, but George was in so little of last season I honestly didn't notice his departure as much as Izzie's.  We are introduced to some new doctors as the merger happens.  They are probably the only thing I didn't like about this season, as I found most of the annoying, with the exception of Dr. Avery.  Alex deals with the loss of Izzie and their impending divorce, Christina and Owen have a relationship hurdle to jump over, Callie and Arizona have a 'baby' of a problem, Derek becomes the new chief and all the hardships that come with that, a blast from the past comes back to haunt the Chief, Bailey gets some love action, Lexie and Mark part ways, Meredith deals with her father and a very significant loss.  If that isn't enough to entice you, then the finale should be.  A gunman is loose in the hospital and no one is safe.  Literally every moment has you on the edge of your seat and in a perpetual state of shock.  Some don't make it out alive, and others will never be the same. When I watched it live I could hardly wait for the commercial breaks to be over.  I never thought any episode would be better that the season 2 finale, but this episode makes that one look like a filler episode.  Overall this was a great season with a season finale to 'die' for! Don't miss the season 7 premiere September 23rd!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Not much to say other than I am absolutely addicted to Desperate Housewives, so is my husband! I don't want to give any juicy details about the season away so thats pretty much all I will say here. There are tons of episodes plus extended versions of 1 episode every disc except 1 or 2.     Just buy it, totally worth it! I am about to order season 3 soon. Season 2 was really good too!!!    I recommend buying the season 1-3 set instead of separately. It costs more, but in the end if you are buying each season separately it will save you!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Several months ago I read that Accept had finished their new opus and it has been worth the wait. This is the best album they have put out since the mid 1980s! The new singer, Mark Tornillo, fits in very well. For those of you who don't know about Mark, he used to be in the 1980s metal band T.T. Quick (check out Front Burner and Hell To Pay for some classic metal!). On songs like The Abyss he even \\"croons\\" in the middle and then ends it with a scream that sounds like vintage Jon Oliva of Savatage. Mark's lyrics are more aggressive and darker than I expected but I suppose that's just a reflection of the times we are living in with war, terrorism, rampant greed, etc. As for the rest of the band, the classic metal riffs and wailing solos are back in full force. It's hard for me to pick favorites at this point in time because the album is quite solid with plenty of midtempo Accept crushers and a few fast ones. The production is loud, clear and crisp, although I might have put Mark's vocals a bit louder on some of the songs. I'm not going to knock Udo because he is a metal legend, but I did not like the direction the band took in the 1990s trying to sound like something they were not. This album is a return to form for Accept. I only have a couple of minor complaints with the new album. First, guitarist Herman Frank only has one songwriting credit. Wolf and Peter are master metal blacksmiths when it comes to forging killer riffs but Herman is a metal legend in his own right. The man has appeared on classic albums by Sinner (Touch of Sin!), Victory, Moon 'Doc, and Hazzard. I hope they do another album together where Herman finally has more input (he came in after Restless and Balls were basically finished). Second, while there is a lot of great soloing on the album I kind of miss the days when Wolf's solos were like melodic mini-compositions (Starlight, Fast As A Shark, Ahead Of The Pack, etc.) rather than just fiery licks or melodic fills. But despite that the album gets4 1/2 stars from me and I would put it in my top five along with Balls To The Wall, Restless & Wild, Metal Heart, and Russian Roulette. Hail the return of the Metal Masters!
B000N4SADC|5.0|\\"Time Control\\" showcases Hiromi's eclectic love - Dream Theater and King Crimson - the love of polyrhythm and powerful motifs.

Some say she's too frenetic, I say she's fully alive.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|The 2009 edition of Australia's Wolfmother is essentially a different band from the one that released their stunning debut in 2006.  Only Andrew Stockdale remains from the original trio and officially asserts himself as the main man in the band here.  With new members in tow this version of Wolfmother is a leaner, meaner music machine with a wider variety of material in it's repertoire.  The band still take their sound from 70's era hard rock with elements of Sabbath, Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Uriah Heep surfacing throughout the disc.   They also occasionally mine more pop oriented fare with comparisons to Cheap Trick, Oasis or even The Beatles to be found.   What all of these influences boil down to, is a modern version of classic rock done really really well.  Yea, it has all been done before, but these guys do what they do so well that everything sounds fresh and invigorating.  I truly enjoy the wide variety of music to be found on this disc, and find the material to be much more diverse that the band's debut.  \\"White Feather\\" is the only track on the disc that I don't care for that much, but even it has grown on me with repeated listens.  All in all, with the new lineup Wolfmother have improved over what was already a very solid band.  To my ears this is one of the best heavy rock albums of 2009 and if you are into a somewhat retro inspired release it does not get much better than this.  Sadly the album does not seem to have done as well here in the U.S. as the debut did.  The album did not get a lot of airplay and seemed to have came and gone fairly quickly.  Hopefully this will not dissuade the band from continuing in this direction in the future.   It would be sad to see a band with this much talent fade away.
1439102813|4.0|At first , when I saw what the subject matter was, I was a bit hesitant ...however, after the first few pages I knew I would love this book....and when it was over ...I was sad...and wish it kept going...the true sign of a good book!!
B00008DDSC|4.0|The secretary is simply splendid and refreshing. I am glad to see a film that is unconventional, yet still has traces of a romantic comedy.  Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a cutter. She gives herself pain and in return gets pleasure from it. In the beginning of the film Lee gets out of the hospital and looks for a job. He starts working for a lawyer, Mr. Grey (James Spader). Mr. Grey himself has psychological issues having to do with control. Initially the relationship they have is sort of shocking, but you soon realize that it may actually be healthy. The issues that they have sort of come together to fit in a yin yang. They begin to complement each other.  Lee was a good role for Maggie Gyllenhaal. I think she did very well. I always enjoy watching James Spader's performances. He can act sophisticated and professional, yet crude and mean at the same time. He was also perfect in the movie Pretty and Pink. I recommend this film for the open minded. It is not a typical romance film. What I thought was so genuine to the characters was that it wasn't just the act of sex and affection that brought the lovers together, but a specific quality that brought Lee and Mr. Grey together.
0451228731|5.0|When I sat down to read this, I thought I'd read a few chapters.  So I read 40 pages...then 75 pages...then 100 pages, because I was absolutely rapt with it.  The story and characters make it exciting, the realism makes it terrifyingly creepy.  The story is expertly crafted; it features a fish-out-water main character, with which the reader can identify in a setting that deals with incredible and awe-inspiring technology.  This book should be read by everyone.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|To all the haters, if you dont like the album stop listening to it. From Hybrid Theroy to know the band has been going thru a metamorphis, and if you coulndt see that early on and are just now realizing it well then maybe you need to stop listening to music all together. To think that the band can change their sound like they have and still maintain the fan base they have is impressive! I get tired of bands that sound exactly the same on every album they produce and in many cases have stopped listening to bands because of this. LP reinvents themselves everytime they release a new album and I believe they do it exceptionally! For those looking to buy the album, if you felt so-so about MtM then this may not be the album for you, sample it first. For the true fans that have loved everything they have released, download it, but it at the store, do whatever you do because it is a must for any true LP fan's library!!
B002ODEJYE|5.0|Much to the shagrin of my nineteen year old daughter (she's a Taylor Swift fan), over the past several years I've come to really enjoy watching and listening to Pink sing and perform.     While her competition has tended to stagnate (you know who they are), Pink's defied the gravity of time that's pulling them down, and done nothing but get better and better at entertaining you with her engaging, sometimes spicy, lyrics, her deceptively powerful voice, and her captivating, almost mesmerizing, on stage presence.    I recently bought a high end AV receiver and Blu Ray player to replace what had been an excellent, but now dated, Sony ES AVR & DVD setup, and immediately commenced acquiring Blu Ray DVDs that would confirm spending all that money was,indeed, justified.     Having acquired the Funhouse and other Pink CDs over the past few years, and having seen snips of \\"Funhouse Tour\\" on Palladia (MTV) I decided to see how well the \\"Tour\\" looks on Blu Ray, and sounds in THX/5.1 sound.     You might say I set out on a one fan mission to see if Pink \\"delivers the goods\\" in person.     As my young daughter used to say (constantly), OMG!    From the opening number, the throaty clarity, power and depth of Pink's vocals, coupled with a just right combination of thoughtful and provative lyrics (she's the perfect combination of a saucy little minx and a rascally tomboy), are delivered with an onstage visual energy that just hasn't been matched in ANY rock concert video I've ever seen.    The song mix (new songs, old songs, cover songs) ebbs and flows almost seemlessly, and Pink sings and dances at 110% througout it all.     God, that girl's got energy.    And she makes sure her incredibly talented band and vocalists share in the spotlight while her dancers girate tirelessly througout the concert's dance numbers.     Nobody gets left behind.    I was particularly awed (and so was her Aussie audience) by Pink's rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody, which may well eclipse the orginal version by Queen.        Pink's fearless acrobatics just add to a sumptously satisfying visual and aural experience that I'm sure I'll enjoy over and over again.    Though I do worry I'm cranking it up so loud I may end up like an over stimulated six year old kid on a sugar high.    Definitely money well spent.
B0041YSBKC|5.0|Where most artists try for a different sound in their solo efforts, Brandon Flowers respects his roots with The KIllers and decides to keep it in an accessible realm his band's fans can easily appreciate. There's a slight more twang and soul by comparison, but Flowers' vocals are capable of making them worth your while. This is one of the best albums of 2010, and I cannot recommend it enough. It's an impressive effort that makes you wonder what can only happen next with The Killers.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you have a PS3 or a Blu-Ray player, this needs to be on top of your collection.  I've watched each disc at least 5x and I never get tired of it.
B0041UW5CG|5.0|On Wilderness Heart, Black Mountain has further matured from their second release In the Future. This album finds them balancing the heavy Sabbath/Zeppelin/Judas Priest-sounding riffage of \\"The Hair Song,\\" \\"Let Spirits Ride,\\" and \\"Wilderness Heart\\" with the more delicate \\"Buried by the Blues,\\" \\"Radiant Heart,\\" and \\"Sadie.\\" There's even \\"Old Fangs\\" which could have been recorded by corralling The Cars, Weezer, and The Smashing Pumpkins into the studio and locking the door. While the experimentation and heavy 70's psychedelics seem to have been scaled back on Wilderness Heart, it's still brutal and beautiful. This band knows how to rock.
1439165645|5.0|A wonderful change of pace from all the food novels that are strictly about French or Italian food.  The descriptions of Indian food and culture are vivid and enticing.  The plot moves along smoothly, and the characters are well developed.  Highly recommended for all who enjoy books entwined with the delights of cooking and eating.
B003XL6EKS|3.0|I was, like many, very curious of The Killers' Brandon Flowers solo effort. We've heard the music he's made and written for the group but `Flamingo' is his opportunity to define himself as a solo artist apart from the group. If you're wondering if his style and musical preference is really any different from that of the group, don't worry. It's both the albums' strength and weakness: most of the music on `Flamingo' sounds very much like the music you'd expect from The Killers. If you listen to this album without the knowledge that this is meant to be a solo record for Flowers, you'd think this was just another The Killers release. In a way, I was pleased with the album overall because The Killers and Flowers are known for some very unique music that harkens back to Springsteen, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan. On the other hand, I was let down because I saw this as Flowers' opportunity to be challenged as a writer and musical artist and experiment. Still, `Flamingo' has its high points and makes for a decent solo debut.<br /><br />The Good: The best part of the album is the second half. The last half of the features tracks where Flowers ventures away from the style and sound that's come to define The Killers and experiments a bit with different instrumentation and beats. \\"Magdalena\\" is the first track that really caught my attention from the album. Flowers said that the track itself was inspired by a pilgrimage a group of faithful make to a town in Mexico. Even though the subject feels random, he sounds more connected to this song than the others. Other stand out tracks were \\"Crossfire\\" with its western flair with a rock vibe; \\"On the Floor\\" that sounds like a song from the `50s and `60s that features Flowers' great ability to pen lyrics that capture a moment and fully describes it with great details while evoking emotion through his unique vocal style; \\"Swallow It\\", while sounding suggestive, has Flowers being a bit sensual as he advises a woman who's in over her head take her time and stick to her guns rather than giving up.<br /><br />The Bad: The first half of the album was a bit dull in my opinion. It sounds too much like unreleased tracks from The Killers and didn't do much to define Flowers as a solo artist. I was also taken back by how Brandon Flowers chose to release a solo album of music that feels very safe and expected. Yes, he's a songwriter and the image and brains behind The Killers but I felt this solo album was his chance to stand out a bit and do some songs that The Killers would never do as a group. I was shocked that most of the experimentation and chances were taken on tracks left as \\"bonus\\" extras for the deluxe edition. In my opinion, the tracks like \\"The Clock Was Tickin' \\" and \\"Jacksonville\\" should have been included on the standard edition rather than tracks like \\"Playing with Fire\\" or \\"Hard Enough\\" which felt like leftover tracks from The Killers.<br /><br /> At the end of the day, I'm on the fence about the album. Of the standard edition tracks, half of them feel inspired and interesting while others feel like leftovers from The Killers' albums. I wish Flowers had taken more chances with his music; the album feels very safe. He doesn't stray far from the type of music or style that's made The Killers a hit band. That's ok, I'm sure many fans will be delighted that `Flamingo' offers up a slew of Killers-worthy tracks. However, with this being a solo album, it seemed like a great opportunity for him to define himself as a solo artist. Perhaps he could have taken more chances with the lyrics; I personally think he could have experimented a bit more with the music and instrumentation backing. I was let down by the fact that producer Stuart Price, the guy behind Madonna's `Confessions on a Dancefloor', Kylie Minogue's `Aphrodite' and most recently the Scissor Sisters' `Night Work' album wasn't able to really take Flowers into any new musical directions. He did wonders for these other artists but his usual synth and mixing style seems absent or subdued on `Flamingo'. If you get the album, definitely spring for the deluxe edition: the bonus tracks add more to the album in terms of variety, style and experimentation.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"On the Floor\\", \\"Jacksonville\\", \\"The Clock Was Tickin'\\", \\"Welcome to Las Vegas\\"sent or subdued on `Flamingo'. If you get the album, definitely spring for the deluxe edition: the bonus tracks add more to the album in terms of variety, style and experimentation.

0316044695|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend as a must-read and I was all-in, being a big fan of (much superior) books like \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"Bravo Two Zero.\\"  By and large, this story had all the makings of a \\"Black Hawk Down\\" in Afghanistan, as many of us remember that terrible day and definitely wanted to read a first-person account of what went on over there.    The first part of the book details the SEAL training in San Diego and, despite the tortured prose (and it IS tortured), it actually paints a very vivid picture of how grueling it is (if you've seen the cable series, you get the idea). But, oh, that tortured prose.  What first starts out as sort of an aw, shucks!-style Texas colloquialism soon becomes a grating, badly-written-screenplay character string of cliches.  That, and some very strange choices of nouns that suggest the author was constantly (and unnecessarily) referring to a thesaurus.    We eventually get to Afghanistan and the doomed mission (which, like Black Hawk Down, seemed doomed before they even went on it--you wonder why nobody spoke up).  The meat of the book.  And while the story is harrowing and the loss of his teammates gut-wrenching, what torches the whole book is the incessant, irrelevant and just plain strange political ranting that hits a fever pitch by this point.  Apparently the author thinks about as much of \\"liberals\\" as he does of the Taliban, and according to him, this whole massacre would have never happened had a key decision not been made because it was unduly influenced by the \\"liberal media\\" and what they would eventually suffer at the hands of it were they to do the thing they really needed to do.  In fact, the \\"L\\" word pops up so frequently--mentioned in disgust--you wonder if you bought a book on an epic combat narrative or the script for a speaker at a Sarah Palin rally.    It's a shame, because I wanted to love this book (as I did the other two) and he has a very valid point about how you don't fight men with no rules in the way that we've always fought under the Geneva Convention.  But the moment he turned it into a diabtribe about how only right-wing, Texas-born and Bible-thumping Americans can occupy the highest echelons of honor and courage, it became demagoguery.  Too bad.  This story deserved better than this.    That, and to be honest, some of the prose was so over-the-top melodramatic and cliched I did wonder at points if this was even real, and not made up.  Some of it sounded like bad prose you'd see in a chain email.    Either way, what those men suffered was unthinkable and it's amazing he even survived, but the whole accounting deserves a far better telling than this.  If you want a great read about what happens when the good guys get discovered and then have to fight for their lives because they couldn't bring themselves to execute the civilians who discovered them, Bravo Two Zero is what you want.    I will give him credit for painting a very vivid picture of how frigid and unforgiving and inhuman the Taliban/AQ were, totally willing to die.  That was a pretty scary picture.
B0036ORISO|4.0|UK indie quartet Everything Everything's debut \\"Man alive\\" is a quirky Pop/R&B mix (with unexpected signature and key changes) that is at times a bit difficult to digest. They come across a wee bit like Vampire Weekend on helium.<br /><br />Opening is the groovy Dancey Duran Duran-style \\"My k, ur bf\\" with soft tight harmonies and vocalist Jonathan Higgs flitting from full voice to falsetto and back in the blink of an eye, a feat he repeats throughout the album. \\"QWERTY finger\\" is a rush of hand-claps and percussion with trilling guitars.<br /><br />\\"Schoolin'\\" finds them at the height of their eccentricity shifting from Funk through Rock through Jazz with fluid ease. \\"Leave the engine room\\" is a synth ballad, while the ballad \\"Final form\\" fits in some buzzing bass and skittery beats in the final 2 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Two for Nero\\" is a harpsichord ballad while \\"Suffragette suffragette\\" is a groovy number with lushly layered harmonies and cutting guitars. \\"NASA is on your side\\" is a theatrical synth ballad, while the gently stomping \\"Tin (the manhole)\\" is like A synth Fleet Foxes.<br /><br />Higgs stated that he set out to write songs that don't sound like anyone else and I must say his band have succeeded in creating a rollercoaster ride. Music this expansive needs a map.
0805091742|4.0|That was the first thing that intrigued me. Checklist have a certain cliche attached to them, my first though was about all the old war movies I've seen, where the pilot goes through his pre-flight checklist, mostly used a build up for the coming action. In my experience in the actual modern work place, checklists are mostly an after thought. Since they're inherently short and not verbose, it's assumed that anyone can write them and that not much thought should be placed into the details of the checklist.    The second thing that caught my eye was the word manifesto. A very strong word, not much used outside of political tracts, for the reason that it has some unfortunate revolutionary connotations. However, I found that the enthusiasm that Atul Gawande brings to the subject amply justifies the word manifesto in the title. He really believes in his message, and that comes across in the book.    The author's willingness to candidly discuss failures, including his own, and how the checklist proposes to remedy these failures is what brings the book beyond the simple isn't-this-neat type of intellectual musing familiar from the Malcolm Gladwell type of books (although I'm a fan of Gladwell).    The style of the book is engaging, and deals with the checklist in various technical field like modern surgery, aviation, and construction, yet is quite accessible to the lay person.  Despite the casual discussion style of the book, the main concepts of checklist both in what they are by definition and why they are effective is made clear and is convincing. Oddly enough, given the nature of the subject being written and it inherently fitting in one or a few pages, the author doesn't provide one single example of a checklist. But after reading the whole book, it's not needed, the argument is made and if one is not convinced, at least one should be able to identify the key points or flaws in any checklist.    Based on the recommendations from this book I have started to include more effective checklists into my work environment, including going back and figuring out why some existing checklists simply didn't work (they where actually lists of procedures not functional checklists). I've also identified some key areas that are benefiting from clear six item checklists. A small difference certainly, and they are very small checklists, but in the spirit of the manifesto, if one of those checklists saves even one hour of problem resolution time, then they are quite worth it.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Robert Plant's new CD \\"Band of joy\\" is a continuation of the rootsy Folk sound of his Grammy winning collaborative effort \\"Raising sand\\" with Alison Krauss. Simple yet beautiful songs comprising covers and new compositions that sound like classics already.<br /><br />The album melds the secular with the sacred, with fiddle-driven jigs like \\"Angel dance\\", the retro Blues \\"I'm falling in love again\\" on the same disc as the enchanting traditional Hymn \\"Satan your kingdom must come down\\".<br /><br />\\"Silver lining\\" is a gently quivering Psychedelic lament while the bouncy \\"You can't buy my love\\" is Country/blues. The waltz-like \\"Monkey\\" (with Patti Griffin harmonizing perfectly) is atmospheric and filled with quivering guitars, an absolute masterpiece, and closing is \\"Even this shall pass away\\", Blues with cluttered beats and snarling guitars.<br /><br />What a joy this is!

B003VQM2M4|4.0|\\"Grinderman 2\\" is the sophomore release by Nick Cave's side project Grindeman, a follow up to their eponymous debut. It's more of his Punk/Blues hybrid, along the lines of Jack White.<br /><br />The CD comprises 9 tracks, with \\"Mickey Mouse and the goodbye man\\" alternating between snarling/growling guitars and gentle verses with wolf howls. Guitars continue to howl and whine on \\"Worm tamer\\", and \\"Heathen child\\", while sombre atmospheric is \\"When my baby comes\\" with tumbling guitars and sweeping strings.<br /><br />Still slow is \\"What I know\\" with creaking effects and a gently pulsing beat, while the distorted rocker \\"Evil\\" has shades of Bowie. \\"Kitchenette\\" finds Cave warning \\"I'll stick my fingers in your biscuit jar and crush all your gingerbread men\\" against a slow burning squawking backdrop.<br /><br />\\"Palaces of montezuma\\" is a harmonious almost Folky piece, while closing is the reverb-filled \\"Bellringer blues\\" with untamed guitars wandering against a surprisingly gentle backdrop. Brilliant stuff.
B000JGD24G|1.0|&#34;Bloody Sunday&#34; is a politicized misrepresentation of the infamous shooting of Catholic demonstrators by the British Army in Northern Ireland 30.01.72. It is made by Paul Greengrass and IRA sympathizer Don Mullan.<br /><br />The film is shot in a real-time documentary style manipulating viewers into believing they are watching real events when in fact they are watching a politically-motivated film made largely by IRA sympathizers.<br /><br />The film manipulates the viewer in a pro-Irish , anti-British direction. For example actors who usually play good guys (Jimmy Nesbitt) are cast as the Irish whilst actors who play pompous figures (Tim piggot smith) are cast as the British. NICRA (Civil Rights Movement) is misrepresented as non-violent when in reality it used violent confrontation as a tactic.<br /><br />The portrayal of this event as a massacre of defenseless peace-loving pacifists is totally false. The Bogside of Derry was an IRA-controlled war zone which was perilous for the Army to operate in.  The soldiers were attacked with acid bombs and by pre-arranged snipers (though the Saville inquiry believes the British fired first). None of this is shown in the film.<br /><br />There are long and graphic scenes of Civilians being shot and killed as well as scenes of people crying loudly over dead victims. At the film's conclusion the names and ages of the dead are read out. This is very much a film appealing to emotion rather than reason.<br /><br />It is also extremely hypocritical given the aforementioned sympathizes of the co-producer. Whilst such violence and killing was exceptional for the army this is not the case for the IRA.<br /><br />There is a scene in which nail bombs are planted on a victim. No evidence exists to support this, in fact the film dishonestly hides from the viewer the said individual's membership of an IRA youth organisation.<br /><br />Two senior officers involved with organizing the operation were decorated by the queen for their long service in the British Army on two separate occasions shortly after this incident. &#34;The officers who planned and led the operation were later decorated by the queen&#34; reads a hate-mongering subtitle  at the end, a willful and malicious distortion of the facts.<br /><br />Bloody Sunday is a politically-motivated distortion of real events in order to scapegoat the British for IRA violence. We are told that no reforms were introduced by the British and that they destroyed the Civil Rights Movement and will &#34;reap a whirlwind&#34;.<br /><br />In fact there had been years of reform since 1968, with all demands being introduced by 1975 (with NICRA disbanding voluntarily in 1981 ). Sadly most reviewers are unaware that they have been misled by a slick piece of IRA propaganda!long service in the British Army on two separate occasions shortly after this incident. &quot;The officers who planned and led the operation were later decorated by the queen&quot; reads a hate-mongering subtitle  at the end, a willful and malicious distortion of the facts.<br /><br />Bloody Sunday is a politically-motivated distortion of real events in order to scapegoat the British for IRA violence.

B00383UJ2U|3.0|New Order. Pet Shop Boys. Human League. Joy Division. Just a few of the names that come to mind when one listens to UK Electronic duo Hurts.<br /><br />Their debut \\"Happiness\\" is melodic yet melancholic polished synth Pop, comprised mostly of sweeping ballads which I found disappointing at first as I (like many) had heard the upbeat \\"Wonderful life\\" earlier and had hoped for more of the same.<br /><br />Thankfully, some of the ballads are rather good; \\"Silver lining\\", the echoing \\"Blood, tears & gold\\", \\"Stay\\", \\"Illuminated\\", \\"Evelyn\\", the dark \\"Devotion\\" which is a duet with Kylie Minogue, and the throbbing \\"Unspoken\\", with vocalist Theo Hutchcraft's dramatic tenor soaring or sweeping as needed.<br /><br />Raising the tempo are the harrowing yet incredibly catchy \\"Wonderful life\\", and for more of the same, the surging \\"Sunday\\" (\\"Till you come back where you belong, it's just another lonely Sunday\\"), and the swirling \\"Better than love\\". Closing is the string-swathed piano ballad \\"Water\\" followed by the hidden 2 minute long Quasi operatic \\"Verona\\" with some weeping cello and grand choir.<br /><br />Their lyrics deal with longing and loss, making these cool songs that much more accessible as everyone can identify with them. As good as this is, I feel Hurts can, and will do better on subsequent albums. 3 and a half stars.

B003XL6EKS|3.0|When a band's lead singer goes solo, it is usually to express musical ideas different from those of his/her band.<br /><br />Opening Brandon Flowers' debut CD is the theatrical ballad \\"Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas\\" (\\"Did nobody tell you, the house will always win\\"), not too far in sound from the day job. In fact, the album is produced by Stuart Price who also produced The Killers' last \\"Day and age\\". Not a bad thing if you, like me, are a fan of The Killers. However, the album is a patchy listening experience. It's filled with ballads, a good number of which are desperately ordinary, not doing justice to Flowers' exuberant voice, (\\"Only the young\\" for example) and filled with copious mention of angels and demons, salvation, and other vivid biblical imagery.<br /><br />Still it has its moments; the Countrified \\"Hard enough\\" is a duet with Jenny Lewis and sounds like Bruce Springsteen, as does the bouncy \\"Jilted lovers and broken hearts\\". The Country feel is felt also in \\"Was it something I said?\\" and \\"The clock was tickin'\\" with spoken Jack White-channeling verses.<br /><br />\\"Crossfire\\" is a nice ballad Coldplay or Keane-style, while the hymnal \\"On the floor\\" is a spare ballad. The midtempo chugging \\"Right behind you\\" has lovely reverbing guitars. Standout has got to be the Americana \\"Playing with fire\\" with a bruised Flowers sounding strangled in the wail-like chorus to stunning effect.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of The Killers and I must say, even their album of B-sides \\"Sawdust\\" is stronger and more cohesive than this. Still, this has its moments which are very good too. 3 and a half stars!

B003V5PPZG|2.0|What can i say but Linkin Park will never top their first cd Hybrid Theory or Meteora. I would have to say i wasted $15 for this cd. Cdnow was not available to listen to any tracks before buying it from best buy. So i went off the limb thinking it took so damn long for them to come out with a new cd that it would be half decent. Boy was i wrong. You have 15 songs on the cd, and about half of them is only a minute long of instrumentals. Thats right, your buying a cd with 7 out of the 15 that is nothing but some instrumentals ranging from 30 seconds long to a minute and 30 seconds long. If anyone would like to buy the cd from me, ill sell it to you for half of what i paid for it.....$7.50 for this brand new cd, just send me an email to cwisicle@yahoo. I bought it today and the sad thing is, you cant return a cd after openning it. if you could, trust me, i would. Hybrid Theory and Meteora has yet to be touched by any cd that linkin park has come out with. Granted the mixed cd with jay-z was sweet also...but this cd and Minutes to Midnight were terrible. DONT BUY unless you have the money to throw away.
B003VSVWA0|4.0|After the release of \\"Live in London\\" in March of last year, and \\"Live at the Isle of Wright 1970\\" in October of last year, Leonard Cohen has just released another, yes ANOTHER, live album/DVD combo. I have to admit that my first reaction was \\"money grabbing move!!\\" I mean, last year's \\"Live in London\\" 2CD/DVD combo is a fantastic document from his on-going (never-ending?) world tour.<br /><br />\\"Songs From the Road\\" (12 tracks; 66 min.) brings a collection of tunes recorded all over the world during the 08-09 world tour. Upon reviewing the set list closer, I was pleasantly surprised that there is only a 4 song overlap (Bird on a Wire; Suzanne; Hallelujah; Closing Time) between this and the \\"Live in London\\" album. Testament to the depth of Cohen's catalogue, for one. There are some really great songs on here, including \\"Lover, Lover, Lover\\" (one of my all-time favorite Cohen songs), but also \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" and some lesser-known songs like \\"Heart With No Companhion\\" and \\"That Don't Make It Junk\\". The DVD (91 min.) brings the same 12 songs and some bonus backstage footage filmed by Cohen's daughter. Of course, considering that the capacity of a DVD is about 3 hrs, the DVD is under-used. At the same time, the quality is a step up from the \\"Live in London\\" footage.<br /><br />Incredibly, there is also a track on here (\\"Hallelujah\\") from the set I saw Leonard Cohen do at the Coachella music festival last year. Cohen's set, which happened just as the sun was setting, was one of THE highlights of the entire festival for me. So immediately this became a must-have for me, period. So it may be there a hint of \\"money-grabbing\\" by releasing this collection, but in the end, who would begrudge the legendary Leonard Cohen?
B003XL6EKS|5.0|That's the only way I can think to describe Brandon Flowers' debut solo album. It's beautiful, melodic, & everything that you would expect from someone like Brandon. It's quite a departure from anything Killers' related; but that is a good thing. I love the Killers, and no disrespect to them, but it's nice to hear Brandon in such a raw way. ONLY THE YOUNG, HARD ENOUGH ON ME, CROSSFIRE and many others, including the opener WELCOME TO FABULOUS LAS VEGAS all have such a unique appeal that is hard to find in many musicians. This is a wonderfully, unique album that has a song for every mood & that will never stop playing in my music library.

0143118420|4.0|I came lately to Eat, Pray, Love.  I had the impression it was New Agey, that it was humorless, that it was a manual for surviving divorce, that it must be hopelessly navel-gazing.  In fact, it is a very personable, observant and often hilarious account of a year spent, well, navel-gazing, in, well, a sort of New Agey way.  One of the chief lessons I learned from the book is that navel-gazing done with honesty, self-awareness, awareness of an outer life and, above all, a sense of humor, can be forgivable and entertaining.    Gilbert was a respected fiction writer and journalist when, as she hit her early thirties, she felt herself disappearing in a conventional marriage she realized she did not want.  During a protracted separation made even more complicated by New York's divorce laws, she compounded her woes by falling into the arms of another man with whom she had a tempestuous relationship.  When she is finally free of both messes, she takes a year to restore pleasure, spirituality and balance through her favorite mode, world travel.  A born writer and in need of funding for the venture, she snares a book contract to produce something out of the experience. She is hyper aware of her self-absorption and notes that she selected three countries that begin with \\"I\\" for her adventure: Italy, India and Indonesia.  She was familiar with each and knew what she was going for.  All the same, lots of people and events surprise her, the first being the appearance of her old \\"friends\\" Depression and Loneliness, whom she thought she left behind but successfully negotiates.  She unapologetically digs into the food, language and people of Italy.  From there she moves to an Ashram in India where meditation does not come easily at first, and an older, colorful Texan named Richard helps her let go some old baggage.  And then she moves to Bali to study with a medicine man, where she becomes involved with locals and natives, and through them meets a new man without coming full circleto former relationship templates.     To enjoy this book, let Gilbert be herself.  Do not ask her to address the Middle East wars, or to save Katrina victims.  She is not selfish, just self and often deprecatingly so.  She is sensitive to those in her environment and, in the end, is not needy in a weak sense.  She owns all of her mistakes and does not expect anyone else, including the reader, to help her out. She is a fine writer with an interesting style: she often moves from the past to the present tense, even within a sentence, and it works.
B003ODL004|5.0|I bought this for my brother's birthday. He is a huge Christopher Nolan fan and a movie soundtrack buff. He loved the music on \\"Inception\\" and seemed very please with the gift. He told me he was going to ask for it for Christmas, but I beat him to the punch!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Given Bob Dylan's living legend status and late career renaissance, early reaction to Modern Times was understandably somewhat hyperbolic, with many declaring it equal to his best work. Enough time has passed for us to admit otherwise, but it is still an excellent, near-masterful latter-day high point. No masterpiece but stunningly close, it is the near-equal of its great predecessor Love and Theft. Despite a few weak spots and other minor caveats, it has three full-blown masterworks (\\"When the Deal Goes Down,\\" \\"Workingman's Blues #2,\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin'\\") and several other very high quality works - truly remarkable for an artist as far into his career as Dylan. This puts Modern near the top of Dylan's second tier, which is above nearly anyone else's best and easily one of the 2000s' best albums.    Modern in one sense continues the trend that began with 1997's comeback album Time Out of Mind - or, really, the two solo acoustic traditional folk albums before it - of delving deep into American music's bottomless well. Dylan has of course done so throughout his career, but age and experience lend additional authenticity and gravitas. Though less musically eclectic than Love, this is another whirlwind Americana tour, revisiting several stops and embarking on new ones. With 10 songs - none less than 5 minutes and one nearly 9 - spread over 63 plus minutes, it is clear that Dylan intended a major statement, and he indeed made one.     The first and most dominant genre is blues. Dylan's career has always incorporated blues, but he seems to feel more and more comfortable with it as he ages, having long ago become - as many have noted - the greatest living white blues singer. This has his take on the classic \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" as well as \\"Someday Baby,\\" a riff on the standard \\"Trouble No More.\\" As both are most closely identified with Muddy Waters, his spirit clearly pervades the album strongly. Both songs are quite close to his arrangements, especially \\"Rollin',\\" and these are neither the best nor the worst versions musically, though fans will certainly appreciate the almost fully rewritten words. \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" updates Memphis Minnie/Kansas Joe's legendary \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and just may nod at Hurricane Katrina. Much has been made of these songs' similarities to prior works, but that is exactly the point; blues is communal and traditional, with participants borrowing from and adding to other songs. Dylan is essentially a folk musician, meaning he has always operated in a similar style, but also a bluesman to nearly as strong an extent, and simply puts his spin on these well-worn works. He has earned the right and does it well. Though not revolutionary in terms of the songs or in his own canon, his versions are high quality and very enjoyable. \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" meanwhile mixes the jump blues prominent on Love - while also recalling that album's seemingly stream-of-consciousness lyrics, including a sly 9/11 reference - with liberal doses of Chuck Berry and rockabilly. Between all this and an unusually fast-paced vocal, it is the kind of song that those who swear they dislike Dylan will find hard to resist.    Modern at any rate has a large amount of music that is almost the opposite of blues - the Rat Pack balladry of which Dylan showed himself to be surprisingly fond on Love. He embraces it even more overtly on \\"When the Deal\\" and \\"Beyond the Horizon.\\" The former's melody is based on Bing Crosby's signature \\"Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day),\\" but the song is very much Dylan's thanks to some of his most poetic, profound, and beautifully emotional lyrics as well as a mesmerizing vocal. \\"Beyond\\" sticks more closely to its prototype - \\"Red Sails in the Sunset,\\" also done by Crosby among many others - and is far more typical genre work. Those who dislike Dylan's turn to this kind of music can use it as ammo, but \\"When\\" more than silences them. \\"Spirit on the Water,\\" happily featuring Dylan's first harmonica on album since Time's \\"Tryin' to Get to Heaven,\\" is somewhere between them - but certainly closer to \\"Beyond\\" - in quality and originality.    The three uncategorizable songs - \\"Workingman's,\\" \\"Nettie Moore,\\" and \\"Ain't\\" - are among the best. The first is a musical tour de force ranging well beyond what Dylan is usually thought capable of, with a superb melody and stunningly beautiful, classical-esque piano proving yet again that he is highly underrated on the instrument. It also has some of his greatest lyrics, shot through with fantastic rhyming, intricately woven literary allusions, and his most overt politics since 1983's Infidels. The vocal is also masterful. All told, the song is a true work of art that the young Dylan, however much greater in many ways, probably could not have made. \\"Nettie\\" is Dylan's closest thing musically to traditional folk since the aforementioned acoustic albums, but the lyrics are undeniably Dylanesque. A strange hybrid of the seemingly ancient and distinctly cutting edge, the song is endlessly interesting and somewhat beguiling; after more than four years and innumerable listens, I still do not really know what to make of it. At first I thought it a masterpiece, but I have at times come near to thinking it formlessly hollow. I now lean more toward the former, but the fact that the song remains so absorbing is a high tribute at any rate. \\"Ain't\\" also mixes a traditional folk sound with soaring violin but has lyrics that are the opposite of ambiguous. Mixing musical and literary sources with his own dark imagination, Dylan crafted a lyrical milestone that is nothing less than one of the blackest and most misanthropic songs ever - a deep, thought-provoking, and truly unforgettable word melding. Such lyrical greatness is hardly ever seen on paper, much less heard in song, and only Dylan weld it. As if this were not enough, he also snarls and snaps it out in a perfectly appropriate curmudgeon/troubadour rasp.    All this makes a great album but not quite a perfect one. Its further pursuit of blues and swing ballads certainly invites the criticism that Dylan is becoming musically formulaic. Perhaps more importantly, the words are certainly below par on the weaker tracks. To say nothing of an arguable over-reliance on blues commonplaces elsewhere, nearly all of \\"Spirit\\" and \\"Beyond\\" could have been written by anyone. This can hardly ever be said of Dylan, but these are so weighed down by clichés and triteness that it is undeniable. A further criticism is that several cuts - notably \\"Thunder\\" and \\"The Levee's\\" - are not as peppy as they should be. Given that Dylan self-produced and used his crack touring band, the low-key pace is clearly deliberate, but the songs would be more engaging if they were as upbeat as much of Love. Dylan seems to have realized this, cranking them up several notches in concert to notable improvement.    Despite these small gripes, Modern is a truly great album worthy of Dylan's name - essential for fans and worth checking out for the curious.

B000GRTQSE|4.0|The Modern Times \\"Special Limited Edition\\" is necessary only for those who must have every Dylan release; the standard album will suffice for all others. Slightly different packaging aside, the only bonus is a DVD with a meager four videos. Two (\\"Blood in My Eyes\\" and \\"Things Have Changed\\") are official videos that are unusually well-done but easily available elsewhere; most will have seen them long ago and have no use for them here. \\"Love Sick\\" is the 1998 Grammy performance - a very strong take highlighted by a surprisingly killer Dylan guitar solo but also old news. The only previously unreleased video is a live \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" left over from the infamous Masked & Anonymous film. It is a very good performance but similar to most 2000s live renditions of the cut, and casuals must decide whether or not it makes the \\"Special Limited Edition\\" worth buying.<br /><br />As for the album itself, given Bob Dylan's living legend status and late career renaissance, early reaction was understandably somewhat hyperbolic, with many declaring it equal to his best work.

Those who dislike Dylan's turn to this kind of music can use it as ammo, but \\"When\\" more than silences them. \\"Spirit on the Water,\\" happily featuring Dylan's first harmonica on album since Time's \\"Tryin' to Get to Heaven,\\" is somewhere between them - but certainly closer to \\"Beyond\\" - in quality and originality.<br /><br />The three uncategorizable songs - \\"Workingman's,\\" \\"Nettie Moore,\\" and \\"Ain't\\" - are among the best. The first is a musical tour de force ranging well beyond what Dylan is usually thought capable of, with a superb melody and stunningly beautiful, classical-esque piano proving yet again that he is highly underrated on the instrument. It also has some of his greatest lyrics, shot through with fantastic rhyming, intricately woven literary allusions, and his most overt politics since 1983's Infidels. The vocal is also masterful. All told, the song is a true work of art that the young Dylan, however much greater in many ways, probably could not have made. \\"Nettie\\" is Dylan's closest thing musically to traditional folk since the aforementioned acoustic albums, but the lyrics are undeniably Dylanesque. A strange hybrid of the seemingly ancient and distinctly cutting edge, the song is endlessly interesting and somewhat beguiling; after more than four years and innumerable listens, I still do not really know what to make of it. At first I thought it a masterpiece, but I have at times come near to thinking it formlessly hollow. I now lean more toward the former, but the fact that the song remains so absorbing is a high tribute at any rate. \\"Ain't\\" also mixes a traditional folk sound with soaring violin but has lyrics that are the opposite of ambiguous. Mixing musical and literary sources with his own dark imagination, Dylan crafted a lyrical milestone that is nothing less than one of the blackest and most misanthropic songs ever - a deep, thought-provoking, and truly unforgettable word melding. Such lyrical greatness is hardly ever seen on paper, much less heard in song, and only Dylan weld it. As if this were not enough, he also snarls and snaps it out in a perfectly appropriate curmudgeon/troubadour rasp.<br /><br />All this makes a great album but not quite a perfect one. Its further pursuit of blues and swing ballads certainly invites the criticism that Dylan is becoming musically formulaic. Perhaps more importantly, the words are certainly below par on the weaker tracks. To say nothing of an arguable over-reliance on blues commonplaces elsewhere, nearly all of \\"Spirit\\" and \\"Beyond\\" could have been written by anyone. This can hardly ever be said of Dylan, but these are so weighed down by clich&eacute;s and triteness that it is undeniable. A further criticism is that several cuts - notably \\"Thunder\\" and \\"The Levee's\\" - are not as peppy as they should be. Given that Dylan self-produced and used his crack touring band, the low-key pace is clearly deliberate, but the songs would be more engaging if they were as upbeat as much of Love. Dylan seems to have realized this, cranking them up several notches in concert to notable improvement.<br /><br />Despite these small gripes, Modern is a truly great album worthy of Dylan's name - essential for fans and worth checking out forthe curious.ur years and innumerable listens, I still do not really know what to make of it.

B003AWRMCE|5.0|Minor spoilers ahead...<br /><br />Unforgiven (1992) won four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor, and Editing).  Directed by Clint Eastwood, this western stars Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher, and Anna Thompson.<br /><br />Gene Hackman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett.<br /><br />There have been so many great reviews written, so I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.<br /><br />The story itself is intriguing.  It's basically about two retired outlaws who come out of retirement to collect a bounty.  A group of prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming offer $1,000.00 to anyone who can kill two cowboys that had disfigured one of the prostitutes.  The local sheriff does not like what's going on, as he does not allow firearms or assassins in his town.<br /><br />In Kansas, William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is visited by The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who tries to recruit Munny to kill the cowboys.  Munny recruits his old riding partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  Together they head west to Big Whiskey, Wyoming.  Do they get the job done?  Watch to find out.<br /><br />The atmosphere and feel of the Old West town was captured very thoroughly.  The scenery is breathtaking throughout the movie.  This DVD's clarity is outstanding.<br /><br />The best acting comes from Gene Hackman, in my opinion.  He plays a mean and heartless sheriff very well.  Clint Eastwood is outstanding as well, as is Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, Richard Harris, and Frances Fisher.  Really, EVERYBODY in the movie gives great acting performances.  EVERYBODY.  There are a lot of memorable lines spoken by many of the actors, particularly Eastwood, Hackman, Woolvett, and Harris.  I think Jaimz Woolvett's acting performance is exceptional as the \\"Schofield Kid\\".<br /><br />One of the things I really like about this movie is the darkness throughout.  The nighttime scenes and the scenes in which it's raining remind me of film noir, only this movie is in color.  Really, it's modern day film noir.  I really like the musical score as well.  It's simple, yet highly effective.  It falls into the category of \\"less is more\\".<br /><br />All in all, a great western movie that's a little different than typical westerns.  This one is more realistic, darker, grittier, and the characters have a lot of depth to them.  They definitely aren't shallow characters.  This is my favorite western of all time.  I highly recommend this film.scenes and the scenes in which it's raining remind me of film noir, only this movie is in color.  Really, it's modern day film noir.

B000PFU9GA|5.0|Dawson's Creek was one of my favorite series.  I loved watching these kids grow up and become young adults.  When Katie Holmes was a teen before she met Tom Cruise, she was your girl next door with a good head on her shoulders.  The characters don't talk like teens but they are witty and well thought out.  I own 2 full TV series and this is one of them.  Joshua Jackson is adorable!  James Van DerBeek is well... Dawson and the other characters like Michelle Williams are wonderful and I love them.
0307266303|5.0|This book gave me hope and that in and of itself is a huge gift. I have suffered injury after injury despite working so hard to stay under the radar and not awaken the beast that running has always awakened. I have been forced to run less and less and put on hold dreams of long endurance races while growing more and more miserable at the thought of not be able to do what I love. The story and message of this book are so worth reading, even for non-runners. I remain hopeful while teaching myself a whole new way to run and putting aside old beliefs.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Unreal.  Expectations were set with the epic Hybrid/Meteora creations, and yes, not selling out commercially is certainly a noble intention especially without a compromise in artistic creativity.  However, I am so sorry to feel that Linkin Park has essentially sold 2 albums to me MTM and this latest one, by retaining the LP trademark/band name in which I expect the essence of their metal/pop synthesis to be at least slightly preserved in several tracks.  It is gone.  They have veered so far off track musically that it is not really that much different to saying that they are veered to the equivalent of parallel divergence as a country band, easy listening, or as an \\"indie\\" band.  My beef is I feel $$TAKEN$$ by this, that their metamorphisis has changed them so completely from what I, as a fan, identified them to be.  Hence they profit commercially AGAIN. The retention of the name Linkin Park may yet find that consumer expectations are set that at least one or two of the tracks would  retain the epic dna that WAS at their core... not so ...

B002ZG983M|1.0|*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />Kick-ass is the story of one Dave Lizewski, an 'ordinary', semi-nerdy high school student who can't understand why anyone in his age group never attempted to become a superhero in real life. You would think that such a premise has real comic possibilities but humorless director Matthew Vaughn decides to take things in a different direction. Right off the bat, Vaughn sets a nasty tone by serving up a mentally unbalanced young man, jumping off a building dressed in a superhero costume. The bad vibes are compounded when Lizewski's Mom drops dead of a aneurysm at the breakfast table. Fun stuff!!!<br /><br />The Act I set-up is full of the clich&eacute;s and stereotypes typical of many 'youth' movies of today. For example, there's the obligatory scene where a couple of thugs steal a cellphone and comic books belonging to the good guy high school students. Then there's the stereotypical antagonist, Frank D'Amico, a vulgar comic-book Mafioso whose goons kill two hapless drug dealers in two repetitious scenes that occur within about ten minutes of one another (in one scene, the goons chop off the guy's finger and then shoot him and in a more repulsive scene, a man bursts like a balloon in a giant microwave).<br /><br />Vaughn attempts to conjure up a modern-day 'Don Quixote' figure with his geeky Lizewski. The nerd courts his 'Dulcinea', the attractive but morally bankrupt Katie who's been dating a drug dealer. His first quest to prove himself to Katie fails miserably after he takes on the two thugs who had robbed him earlier and ends up getting stabbed in the stomach, then hit by a car and almost dies. Fortunately when found, he convinces the paramedics not to let anyone know he was wearing his Kick-ass costume; but the rumor gets out anyway that he was found naked and is now presumed to be gay by most students at the school (including Katie who befriends but also patronizes him as she also assumes he's gay).<br /><br />Kick-ass could have gone in a more clever direction by having Lizewski train hard in martial arts and actually become a truly competent 'superhero' in the vein of Bruce Wayne (aka Batman). But instead it's pure luck that he survives the gang fight which he attempts to break up on the streets and in so doing becomes an internet sensation on Youtube. Lizewski continues with his 'Man of La Mancha' act by paying Katie's boyfriend a visit and again naively attempts to intervene on her behalf. As it turns out, 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' save the passive Kick-ass's ass!<br /><br />Now I have no problem with Damon Macready's story arc which involves the former cop attempting to take revenge on bad guy D'Amico after being framed. But what kind of message is being sent when he involves his ten year old daughter in his thirst for revenge? It's wholly inappropriate to depict a ten year old girl being trained by her father to become a professional assassin. Equally inappropriate is when teenager Chris D'Amico aka Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl--what completely makes no sense at all is that Red Mist is upset when his father's thugs carry off his buddy Kick-ass but he has no guilt whatsoever in shooting a ten year old girl? One other thing: after Frank is dispatched, doesn't Chris realize his father is dead? Does he try to find out what happened to his father or does it even occur to him? The bottom line is that the teenager shows no emotions at all which is not in keeping with the character's earlier scenes where he displayed affection for his father.<br /><br />The stupidity of Vaughn's comic book world is further on display when Frank D'Amico mistakenly shoots the wrong Kick-ass in broad daylight. You would think that the head of an organized crime family would be smart enough to realize that there are plenty of people walking around the city in the Kick-ass costume after the character goes viral over the internet. As for Lizewski's revelation to Katie that he's actually Kick-ass--suddenly bad girl Katie is transformed into a saint and falls for him hook, line and sinker. But Lizewski gets rewarded for finally realizing that he was a dumb ass all along! Some hero!<br /><br />The Kick-ass finale is perhaps the most repulsive aspect of the film. Big Daddy and Kick-ass are tortured on live television and then when the networks refuse to show the gory feed, all the voyeurs run to their computers to watch the sorry spectacle online. Finally, Vaughn resurrects his sadistic ten year old after she's shot, who then proceeds to dispatch one Mafia goon after another, in one unspeakably violent scene after another.<br /><br />Somehow after seeing a film like this, I kind of feel that something should be done about our current child labor laws. Rather than having accolades heaped upon Director Vaughn, perhaps the best place for him would be a secure lock-up--criminal or psychiatric, take your pick.lls for him hook, line and sinker.

B003ITZBVS|5.0|i was very surprised how great this movie was.most other of dc's dvd's didn't live up to the hype.this one was well written.when it was over it left me wanting more!dc finaly got it right this time!
0439023513|3.0|I had a feeling the conclusion to the series wouldn't include champagne and cake, however I can't help but feel a little let down.  War is a devastating force and I think Collins did a great job portraying it.  In fact, she may have went a little overboard.  To see it all end this way after so much emotional investment on my part is just plain depressing.  Given the fact that she included an epilogue in which no sort of personal development really occurs for Katniess is heartbreaking and downright frustrating.  While I loved the series as a whole, I can't help but feel a little cheated.
0439023483|5.0|I love this book (and the series!)! It's very fast paced, exciting, and has a good message. Once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down until you reach the end!
0439023513|5.0|I picked up Mockingjay the same night I finished Catching Fire. With the way Catching Fire ended, I was almost reluctant to read on, wondering where the story could go from there, afraid of where it would go.  I worried that a happy but disappointing ending loomed, but I found this to be such a satisfying resolution. It left me with a renewed respect for Katniss and her situation, taking me back to how it all began. It also left me with a sense of combined wonder and dread at the futuristic world created by Collins in this trilogy, not quite far-fetched enough for comfort.  I found all three books to be absorbing, thrilling and satisfying, each in its own way.  I wanted to stay with Katniss, but Mockingjay helped me leave her in the future without feeling empty.

It's not listed in the Amazon listing but if you look carefully at one of the product pics, you'll see that The Plan is in the box.

B000YAA68C|3.0|This movie was ok. Not one that you'd want to watch over and over. That's just my opinion though. I also might be just a little bias on it since I read the book before seeing it. The book was so awesome and I was so excited to see the movie and then blah. I think if I had seen the movie without reading the book my opinion of it might be a little better. I didn't like who they picked to play Holly's sister. She SUCKED. She reminded me of a cartoon character for little kids. The movie omitted some very important characters that were included in the book and honestly, I'm still trying to figure out why. All in all, if I could go back in time to when I bought the movie, I wouldn't buy it. Buy the book instead.
0439023483|5.0|Here's how it started:<br /><br />\\"You have to read The Hunger Games,\\" my little sister said over the phone. \\"I just finished the first one, and the last book just came out.\\"<br />\\"Of course I'll read it,\\" I said, and put it on my mental list. I just didn't think I'd pull out that mental list so soon.<br />Inside Barnes and Noble's coffee shop with 30mph winds outside and a hot chai in my hands, I pick up the bent copy of The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins. Clearly, someone read it before me. For some reason, I imagine this book is about animals. It's a weird title and not very catching (same with the cover....). I shrug. My sister liked it and this wasn't the first time I'd heard the book title. When I hear a book mentioned more than 3 times, I need to read it. It's growing popular. Reviews are needed for those parents who will soon be peppered with, \\"Mom, can I read The Hunger Games?\\" and \\"Dad, but Bobby's reading it. Why can't I?\\"<br />Inevitably, the reply is usually, \\"Because I don't know what it's about.\\" or \\"I don't know if it's safe.\\"<br /><br />The Hunger Games is unique and, to put it bluntly, phenomenal. It pulls an idea from books like, We (Yevgeny Zamyatin)and 1984 (George Orwell), and movies like Equilibrium--the idea of a overruling government--and makes a similar story with thrilling twists, a very believable character, and geared toward teens.<br /><br />North America has returned to a somewhat primitive state years in the future due to revolts, natural disasters, and the growth of the all-powerful government. The common people live in 12 different Districts surrounding The Capitol. To keep the people in line and in fear, the Capitol created The Hunger Games 74 years ago, forcing each district to send one boy and one girl into an arena to fight to the death (aka. 24 kids all fighting each other at once). Each district is required under law to watch the entire game on television live as the contestants (called \\"tributes\\") are forced to battle each other and the government-programmed environment for survival. This is so the Capitol can yearly remind the people why they should fear its power.<br /><br />How do you win in the Hunger Games? Be the last one alive.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, an eligible teenager and our heroine, ends up in the games through a cruel twist of fate. We follow her as she struggles with the idea of killing someone, but we feel her desperation to return home alive as promised to her 12-year-old sister, Prim. Can she resist the strong hand of the Capitol, or does she need to play into it to win?<br /><br />Add to the plot when the boy from her District happens to be someone who saved her life when she was younger. Can she kill him to survive? WILL she kill him? This is the question that runs through her (and the reader's) head through the course of the book.<br /><br />This is a serious book with its funny moments. The main character is brilliantly written in first person, it's hard not to feel like you ARE Katniss Everdeen. I almost cried in the second chapter, not because it was hugely sad, but because it was intense and well written.<br />I've never cried reading a book, and I can only remember one time that I've come close. The fact that The Hunger Games got me to the point of tears when I was in the middle of a crowded Barnes and Noble and only on the second chapter (it did it again in chapter 9), says a lot about the book. Now if a tear actually drops, then this book has accomplished the impossible.<br /><br />The writing is exceptional and Katniss's character development is very thorough. The reader understands her drive, her reasons behind things, her thinking. I enjoy being in her point of view. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. I sat in Barnes and Noble for over 6 hours and read through the whole thing--clearly it's a page-turner (book two is already in the mail on its way to my itching hands).<br />The author has a habit of backtracking--stepping back into Katniss's thoughts and reliving a bit of history. I have always found backtracking horibbly annoying in books--all books but this one. Collins does it in a way where I think, \\"Oh good, I wanted this information.\\" I've never seen a book accomplish that so far.<br /><br />*deep breath*<br /><br />Now for the negatives:<br />This book has many violent areas. Look back to the plotline--it's a battle to the death with 24 teenager contestants. Many are going to die. There is fighting, brutality, blood, death, wounds, some poison-induced hallucinations, etc. It's harsh and I cringed a few times, but Collins never goes into grotesque detail. She always keeps it at an age-appropriate level. PG-13.<br />There is also romance--only kissing so far, but there are several instances of it. Also, at one point in the book, Katniss shares a sleeping bag with the boy from her same district in order to keep warm. Nothing happens and there's not even insinuation, but it's good to be aware of it.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book for young readers (13 and under). Think of it as an appropriately rated PG-13 movie and whether or not you like to watch/read that content. There are no Christian themes or mentions of God (or any other \\"worshipped\\" source), but the novel carries good themes of fighting for freedom. The next few books continue on to address the issue of the overruling Capitol.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because I enjoy the thought of overthrowing bondage. I love the search for freedom because it is built into our souls. The idea of \\"freedom\\" has always been a favorite topic of mine--to read, to write, to watch...and so I enjoyed The Hunger Games.

B00129I5SM|5.0|I've seen all 3 Resident Evil movies and, in my opinion, this one is the best one yet. The first one kicked ass, the 2nd one was ok but, this one, this one was awesome. I haven't seen Afterlife yet but I can't wait. I'm not usually a fan of zombie movies but this series has me hooked. It's terrifying but not in a normal sort of way. Make sense? It's action packed and has awesome special effects. If you buy this one then you need to go ahead and buy the first 2 as well. One of the best things about these movies is that they pick up where the last movie ended. A lot of sequels, or whatever you wanna call these, don't do that. I know I'm supposed to be doing a review for just Extinction but I can't help but rave on the other 2 as well. BUY ALL 3!!!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this album. I was going through issues with that special someone in my life, and it was as though Pink was sitting in my shoes going through every emotion that I felt. Sober, Please Don't Leave Me, and So What, were all written as though Pink was dealing with issues of infidelity, anger yet love, hostility,and frustration (of course, not all at the same time).  I recommend this album to anyone who is going through turmoil in their personal relationships, especially those involving the heart. I was able to see that even someone like Pink, despite her fame and wealth, was not immune to heartache.  The good news is Pink's album had this underlying optimism, which I found refreshing.  Thank you Pink!
0307454541|5.0|I have to be honest, it took me about 80-100 pages to figure out what the hype was about.  I almost gave up!  I'm SOOOO GLAD I didn't.  Once I hit that certain point that snagged me...forget it.  I never put it down and read the rest of the book in two sittings and went and bought the next!  LOVED IT!
B002GZQYMK|3.0|This album is a brave attempt. At what I'm not sure, but it's definitely different. The tracks that are good are as great as anything that Muse has ever released. Those that aren't, REALLY aren't. You even find this good vs. awful extremes in 1 track: United States Of Eurasia / Collateral Damage. The parts that are good, are really really good. The 'I want to be Queen' parts are more cringe-worthy than anything the band has put out so far. I hope this album is a one time fluke and not the beginning of a move from their twisted emotional past to some kind of self-congratulatory prog rock future.

B000FZET5W|5.0|This one is choice.  There are some recordings that sit at the pinnacle of a particular style/type/time/mood.  This is one of those-- just too smooth and too cool.  This recording certainly isn't even close to be the most inspired music that either artist did  -- it certainly seems to have lagged in popularity and attention compared to the artists other recordings.  But, and this is a really big BUT, it is really satisfying, slick and warm music-- all at the same time.  (Speaking of unheralded and inspired, if you haven't checked out Sonny Rollin's \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" recorded live at the NY Museum of Modern Art in 1965 (or 1967-- somewhere around there-- run, don't walk, to get that one  . . . . ).  Anyway, this is a great recording.  It is the kind of music that you can play for damn near anyone-- Jazz buff or not-- and they will like it, yet it is slick enough and well done enough that you will find yourself listening with rapt attention and enjoying its nuances on you 30th, 40th, 50th listening.  Yeah, get this one.  I'm now on my third copy.  One copy didn't get returned.  One CD just disappeared -- I have the case still, but I took it to work, and the CD got passed around and never made it back-- despite my thorough search.  Didn't even make me mad at all.  It is one of those recording that you can understand someone listening to it for the first time and deciding \\"It's mine now . . . . \\"  In fact, the reason I pulled this one up is that I am thinking about getting an extra copy just so I am never without one.  There are about 20 or so recordings that I have purchased an extra copy of, just so I know I will always have it.  This is one of those kind of recordings that when you are in the mood for it, nothing else will do.  One Amazon \\"tag\\" suggestion for this recording that someone came up with is \\"essential greats from the greatest.\\"  I wish I had come up with that expression-- it sure sums this recording up.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|I have to say, I have tried several different Amazon Basics products, and I have always been impressed.  They are simple yet effective, well made, and easy on the wallet.  This Universal Camera Case is no different.  I have to say though, for a case that is supposedly designed for point and shoot digital cameras, this is one big pouch!<br /><br />The case has a simple, modern look, and offers plenty of protective padding.  There is room for the average digital camera, with much room to spare.  There is a handy front storage compartment, which can be used to hold memory cards, spare batteries, and lots of other slim items.  The camera compartment is cavernous!  If it weren't for all of the padding material, I think you could shout into it and hear your voice echo back.  If you happen to have an older, larger digital camera, then this is definitely a great choice for a case.  For newer, slim digital cameras, you will likely notice the camera flopping around inside.  The padding is very protective, so I'm not worried about damage to the device inside.  But one should be very careful when opening the case, as the camera could slip out very easily.<br /><br />Overall I feel that this is a great camera case for the money.  It looks great (I even like the rubberized zipper, with the white and orange Amazon logo), it offers plenty of storage (emphasis on the word plenty!), and offers a good deal of protection for your delicate electronic devices.  For storing larger point and shoot cameras, larger GPS devices, or maybe even one of those little Smart Cars, this Amazon Basics camera case is a great buy, which I highly recommend.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|The movie is an okay movie.  Nothing jumps out to make it a good or great movie.  Amazon as usual shipped the item quickly and safely to me.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Dear Linkin Park,     I thought maybe just maybe you would come out with a good album after MTM. I think statistically most of the fans would agree that was your worst album so far. Now you come out with this album and it's even worse. Either go back to the Hybrid Theory, Meteora, or Reanimation days or start thinking of a new band name. This isn't Linkin Park and I think most would agree that this is a terrible album in general. If you like the old albums, don't buy this!    Thanks
B00030590I|1.0|IMHO, it's one of most overrated films from China.  I guess most were distracted by the dazzling lights and \\"colors\\".       First, the souls of this film are Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, that they save this film from becoming worse than the toilet paper I used in the public restroom, and they should be on the cover of the DVD instead of Jet Li and Ziyi zhang.     Jet Li can't act! Period!  In this film, you can replace Jet Li with a piece of stinky wood, that it'd provide you better chemistry and drama.  Ziyi really has a supporting role here.        Honestly, if I close my eyes whenever Jet Li appears, then I could really enjoy the first 30-35 minutes of the film, but the director, Yimou Zhang fails to show restriant and butcher an otherwise nice original idea for the script.  I meant how many times you can tolerate seeing Tony and Maggie killing each other.  By the time it got to 2nd or 3rd colored, I got very irritated and angry, as if someone just shove an highschool experiment in front of me!!!    IMO, Yimou Zhang either should go back to making folks' story on the countryside with Gon Li, or maybe he should retire.  Just because you are famous, it doesn't mean that you know how to make all kinds of different films.  In this case, Yimou completely wasted the brilliant efforts by Tony Leung/Maggie Cheung.  And that scene with some students jumping to flying arrows was completely foolish and useless to the overall story!       A director (and/or producer) needs to show self-restraint in order to create a masterpiece, which by definition is not too much nor too less but just right.      The ending is also uninteresting!  Oh yeah!  Did I mention that Jet Li is terrible?  Jet Li can't act, and he's completely and totally unfit for this role, Nameless, since the movie requires this character to show all kind of depth of emotion simply by sitting there and facing the Emperor.  It's very tough role, that basically using silence to show so much emotions and *action*.Only a few actors in this generation can get this.   For example, it's like how Russell Crowe faces the Roman Emperor in Gladiator, and/or Chow Yat Fat shows in Better Tomorrow.  I don't think Jet Li would ever has the acting skills for this kind of role.     No!  Not a great film!  Terrible directing!    If you want to watch some nice special effect and costume/make-up, then you can watch about 20 minutes of the film.  If you like Tony Leung/Maggie Cheung, then only watch the first colored story (and maybe second)!  Oh!!  don't forget to forward any sequence of Jet Li, then I guess it's passable!!
B002RGYGU0|5.0|Dan Brown is a very talented story-teller. And Freemasons are appreciative that he is sympathetic to the humane ideals of the Craft. What is also excellent  is that his work give an indication of some familiarity with  serious Masonic scholarship. Masonic scholars like myself are grateful that his story-telling will surely draw the real seekers, the ones who really want to know the hidden meaning, to investigate the  scholarly layer that supports the engaging and captivating tales. Specifically, Masonic scholars are interested in making the nature of Masonic symbolism more clear, since as Brown's title makes show, that is of great popular interest. Yet, perhaps more importantly,  it will have a very healing effect on our society. My article on Kabbalah and Freemasonry which now appears on the fine  \\"Masonic [...]\\"  site describes the Impetus for the Grand Lodge of 1717 which started the history of Speculative Freemasonry and its relation to the great mysteries of Kabbalah, and which continues as  the inspiration for the fascinating stories up until today.
B001FB55L2|4.0|The best thing about the movie is, it allows you to step into all the characters shoes and feel what they are feeling.  The movie is very powerful and is one of the best of the year.
0385504225|5.0|What can one add with over two thousand reviews? Dan Brown has struck a chord for sure, and Freemasons  are glad to see their Craft engaged in a sympathetic way in a fun tale that will delight a lot of people. In addition, Masonic scholars are glad for the general interest in a serious subject.  Meanwhile the intriguing meaning behind the mysteries fictionalized in this book are being thoroughly examined by Masonic scholars in a serious way. On a site like the fine Masonic Sourcebook, which specializes in accurate information about Freemasonry you can find an article like \\"The Impetus for the Grand Lodge of 1717\\" which gives scholarly background  in the mysteries of Jewish Kabbalah for the fascinating fictional story spun in Dan Brown's Lost Symbol.

B003F3NDOO|4.0|Just like a bag of Ruffles potato chips, you can't eat just one! I am serious! this show is really funny and shocking at times. I would sit and watch at least 4 episodes back to back. Crazy I know but I wanted more. I really love all of the actors on this show. They each are special in their own unique way! :) Even at times this show makes me think about my own life and laugh about it! I cannot wait until Season 2 comes out!
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I feel very comfortable playing shooters on the 360 because of the controller, so I decided to pick up the Pro Elite to make my shooters easier to play.  Don't get me wrong, I can play with the Dual Shock 3 just fine, but prefer the asymmetric analog stick of the 360.     It is very easy to set up.  It has a usb dongle you insert into the PS3, and from there you run a mini usb to mini usb cable(included) to the controller to charge, and also to sync it with your system.    I had to go through two of these before I decided they weren't worth it.  The first one I recieved had a nonfunctioning L1 button.  I pressed it, and nothing.  I sent it back and got a replacement a couple days later(Thanks Amazon).  On the second one all the buttons and the Sixaxis worked well. The left analog worked perfectly.  I tried it on Uncharted 2.  I nudged the stick slightly, and Drake reacted.  The right stick however had a big deadzone.  I had to move it a quarter of the way before Drake responded.  When it comes to shooters, this is huge because you need as much precision as possible.  So for me, being the main reason I bought this controller, that was a dealbreaker.    I tried the Sixaxis with Flower, which is a game that is pretty much strictly a Sixaxis game.  It worked perfectly for it.    The L2 and R2 triggers are redesigned so they feel more comfortable.  It keeps your fingers from sliding off. The problem with them is that they are too short.  The Dual Shock triggers have more play than these, which comes in handy when playing racing games where every slight pull on the triggers increases speed or steps on the brake.    The rumble also seems to be weaker than the Dual Shock. I really don't care about that because as long as it rumble somewhat, it will help me when playing.    Also whenever you press the \\"Home\\" button with the system on Standby, it will not turn the system on.  You have to turn the PS3 on first before you can use the Pro Elite and if you use another controllerto turn the system on, then you will have to reassign the Pro Elite to be controller one.  This may be small to some, but I figured it's worth noting.    Since my primary purpose for this controller was to play shooters, it fails in my eyes. Like I said, it's a great concept but ultimately falls short of it's potential.
1582701709|3.0|the book was in brand new condition but was a absolute bore to read.I couldnt understand why this book was all the rage.the chapters pretty much repeat over and over ..think it and it will be think negative and thats all you'll ever get...... I just saved you some money......
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Well first off, I've always been a huge fan of Linkin Park. I was hooked as soon as I bought the little nicky soundtrack (don't judge me) and heard Points of Authority. I think it was before Hybrid Theory started getting real press. With that said, I understand the attempt to evolve, but with each album they take a larger and larger step. Hybrid Theory is my favorite album, then Meteora, which was a little too short, but they managed to keep their edge. Then came Minutes to midnight, which took some time to grow on me, but definitely felt like they were trying to push the genre. Whatever, it worked, I liked it. Now to A Thousand Suns... Linkin Park took the jump from Meteora to MTM and multiplied it by 100. This was not pushing the genre, this was just shifting to a different genre. Long gone are the awesome guitar rifts of Hybrid Theory, replaced with random synthesized beats. I was just listening to the album (being disappointed) and decided to go back to Hybrid theory to see if they were always so synthesized-centric. Not at all. I equate this to an album from another great band - Metallica/St Anger. It just didn't work. They tried hard to make something different but its just not there in terms of being catchy or appealing    I long to hear Brad, Dave, and Rob again.. what did they even do on this album?    I see the irony in the one track from the Fort Minor album, with Mike talking about how the record label wanted them to change, and they rejected it, stayed true to themselves, and succeeded. Well if changing then meant failure? What does it mean now?    Hopefully they make a quick turnaround with another album and get something out to appease the fans that made them who they are. Enough mash-ups, remixes, and \\"pushing the genre\\".

B002ZG98J6|2.0|So, I read this book about a 12 year old boy and his 12 year old friends and then i heard there was a movie so i watched that... ONLY TO FIND THE 12 YEAR OLDS BEING PLAYED BY AN 18 YEAR OLD, A 24 YEAR OLD AND A 26 YEAR OLD WITH A GOATEE.<br /><br />The Justin Bieber hair and the squishy, constipated emo facial expressions teenage percy had plastered on his face really did not help endear him to me. Was annabeth supposed to be a cyclops? because i only saw ONE of her gigantic creepy blue eyes the whole movie. (yeah by the way, in the book her eyes were GREY and her hair BLONDE not brown.) in the book grover, the satyr is supposed to be pale white with red hair. i do appreciate hollywood trying to squeeze in minorities into the movies but was it really necessary to have a MYTHICAL CREATURE behave like a STEREOTYPICAL HORNY GHETTO person? It's a KIDS MOVIE, leave the sex stuff out for goodness sakes! I think it's more insulting to black people than it is beneficial. would a white skinned satyr have acted like that? no? then leave it out!<br /><br />forget the physical appearance of the actors, 90% of the movie was totally different than the book. the ONLY thing i actually liked was the Uma Thurman scene (Medusa) medusa was supposed to be ugly in the book but the movie did a good job (or at least Uma Thurman did.)<br /><br />If the movie hadn't been based on a book but just been a movie i would have given it 3 stars (deducting 2 stars for the horrific acting of percy, cyclops girl and horny ghetto satyr.)
B003S897U0|5.0|In \\"Croweology\\" the Black Crowes play through their catalog re-doing their favorite songs and filling an album to the brim.  A good companion to the acoustic \\"Brothers of a Feather\\" live album where Chris and Rich stripped down Crowes songs alongside their own solo work, this new record just presents the best version of the band.  Unprocessed, unfiltered, just making music and intimate unlike the \\"Live\\" which is great too, but is very much the Chris-show as he plays to an audience.  This feels like the band playing for themselves and it's great.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I haven't read the graphic novel (though I should) but the film is a masterpiece of execution, bringing together a tightly-knitted plot, a tremendous cast of actors and some truly memorable visuals. V is a cinematic giant that transcends the melodramatic elements that dog many comic book adaptations, and manages to tread the line of raising complex political issues while capably keeping the audience in suspense every step of way.<br /><br />The main character, \\"V\\", is a model for every citizen - unchanged, unhinged, unwavering - he stands for ideas with a steadfast motivation that's both simple and admirable, against a backdrop of a totalitarian Great Britain as a portent of things to come. V is a fine example of mode-against-type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that. It's remarkable how Hugo Weaving manages to convey the entire character without the audience ever seeing his face. Similarly, Natalie Portman is perfect in her role as a scared citizen who overcomes her fear of the system and develops a sense of true freedom.<br /><br />It's a great movie that's as important as it is well-made. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack from Dario Marianelli that just lifts the soul and underscores the transformative and inspirational message of the film.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I saw this a few months back.  Better than expected.  It's a three star normally but the all star studded cast pushed it up to four.  The approach is a two pronged story showing Julia Childs before she was famous and all the resistances she met in her life (Stanley Tucci does an amazing job of playing her supportive husband) and then jumping to modern day Julie who has resistances of her own.  Notice that Jany Lynch (i.e. Sue Sylvester from GLEE) is the sister of Julia Childs.  Meryl Streep was nominated for best actress for the AA and GG.  She won the GG nomination for best actress in a musical or comedy.  WHEN WATCHED: June; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
B002ZHKZD8|3.0|I'm probably in the minority with this, but I was disappointed with this movie.  The worst part of the movie was frankly the directing.  I would like to know in what alternate reality that shaky cameras, poor lighting and bland colors make for great visuals?  I know the director is trying to be different, but come on.  What moron films fight scenes in the dark?  What's the point of choreographing a fight sequence where nobody in the audience can see what's going on?  It's ludicrous.  How about some of those camera angles?  Let's show a closeup of a guys chin during a chase scene.  This movie looked like it was filmed by a high school kid on a shoestring budget.  Just awful. The problems don't end there either.  It's not that I necessarily think this was a bad movie, it's just that it was a total duplicate of the Bourne Supremacy.  Completely identical.  Same car chases. Same brawl with another assassin.  Same endless running from local cops.  The only thing new in this film is the revelation of Bourne's past, which was good.  I felt a little cheated that this crummy director couldn't find anything new to put in this movie.  Nothing.  It's either laziness or lack of new ideas.
B002R0F3Q2|1.0|This Cd in my opinion is lacking something... I thought it would be inspirational and it def. fell short. I only like two of the songs and I am overall disappointed.
B0041VIJQG|3.0|I have to disagree with all of the other reviews here - Robert Plant's cover of Los Lobos' \\"Angel dance\\" is vapid. I love both Plant and Los Lobos, and Angel Dance is a fantastic song, but the Los Lobos version is far, far superior. Plant's voice on the song sounds weak and feeble. As a matter of fact, I saw Robert Plant on stage with Los Lobos this past summer in Chicago where he sang a blues tune, and again his voice did not stand up to the music, sounded fragile where it needed to be robust. I can't comment on the other songs on this album, but if they're anything like Angel Dance, then forget it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is Joss Whedon at his quirky best: a freewheeling amalgam of Western and space opera.  It is big and misanthropic and brainy and funny and touching, sometimes all at once; it has acquired the most fiercely loyal following of any untimely dead TV series since Star Trek: the original series.  I wear a brown trench coat because of that show (well, I had the coat before the show came out, but I STILL wear it because I'm a Browncoat, dammit).      Firefly is the Star Trek franchise with a high testosterone titer and a streetwise distrust for Big anything, including government.  It's gutty, smart, heartbreakingly good television.  And it ended far too soon.    It also had some of the best actors in television at the time: Nathan Fillion, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau and (may God love her, I surely do) Jewel Staite were all welcome discoveries of the series, while Ron Glass - whom I've followed since his \\"Barney Miller\\" days - just kills as \\"Shepherd Derrian Book.\\"  Most of Firefly's ingenue cast have gone on to do great work since the show, but they will never shine as they did together in that show.  It was a remarkable, tragically short-lived case of artistic and dramatic synergy.     Nor, unfortunately, has Joss Whedon as a show creator excelled Firefox or is he ever likely to - this was his apex.    It's also grown-up fare, I have to warn parents; but your teens could do worse than watch it, because it also has Lessons to impart - if you're libertarian, small \\"l\\" or large, you're going to love what Whedon has to say about high-minded politicians.  I just love this show.  Odds are pretty good you will, too.    Just as a parting shot, if you like Firefly, see the movie which capped the series, Serenity.  It is very likely the best thing Joss Whedon and the Firefly cast have done or will ever do.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter, though quite disturbing at times, is easily the best written show on television. Hands Down.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Usually a great movie spins off a somewhat less good television series.  This time a great (if tragically short-lived) television series spun off a better movie.      \\"Firefly\\" was Joss Whedon's very best television show; Fox network decided it had better things to do with the time slot, like another moronic reality show, or much less worthy science fiction offerings like the anemic \\"Fringe.\\"    \\"Firefly\\" was a big, brawny, brainy amalgam of western and science-fiction series - which doesn't do it justice by any means.  It was \\"Star Trek\\" with guts, verve, hormones and nowhere near the faith in big government and big space navies.  It is seamy, profane in spots (though the writers took care to have their futuristic outlaw crew say \\"Gordam\\" when taking the Deity's name in vain and do the rest of their swearing in strongly accented Common Tongue Chinese), misanthropic, howlingly funny, bitterly sad, sometimes all at once.      And the movie it spawned, Serenity, is even better than that.  It continues the saga of Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), captain of the transport Serenity, veteran of the bitter war between the Alliance of Planets and the independent worlds who vainly resisted being brought under harmonious pan-human tyranny, and his cheerful crew of smugglers and petty crooks, a courtesan, a priest and a brilliant brother and sister on the run from the Alliance government.  All the fun folks we loved so well from Firefly, plus new characters, some you'll love, some you won't love so much, some you won't care for at all.    Serenity came after the cancellation of Firefly, after the hoarse cries of rage from science fiction fandom which made the welkin ring at Comic-Con and other fan conventions made it clear that there was at the very least a movie left in the franchise.    And it towers high over the TV series - Serenity begins in media res, right in the middle of the action Firefly fans know and love, but soon vaults over even that high standard to tell a story with fast-paced action, with immediacy, humor, and passion.     The characters are the same ones we remember from the TV series - but more alive, fully-engaged... and it is the fitting capstone to that series, the cast earned their pay and gave us a ringing valedictory.  It sews up many loose ends, gives us reason to cheer and weep... inflicts pity and terror and vindication on its audience.  It's an adventure epic, a spy story, a fantasy/science fiction masterpiece, and more than any of that, it's the very best thing Joss Whedon ever set his hand to.      Watch it and mourn that there will be no more from the cask.  Then go buy a brown coat.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|First I'll say it: I am a \\"Twihard\\".<br /><br />My sister-in-law told me about the books right around the time the third one was released and I thought love triangle, vampire, mortal girl, werewolf? Lame!<br /><br />But long about August 2008 I went to Borders and noticed that Twilight was everywhere. Breaking Dawn, the fourth installment in the series, had just been released and apparently that was quite the reason for celebration, and Borders looked like there had been a Twilight explosion.  And for some reason, that intrigued me.  I'm a jump on the bandwagon type of gal, after all.<br /><br />So I went home that day, downloaded a sample of Twilight for my Kindle, and I've never looked back!  When I heard they were making movies, I think my heart actually twittered, or I was twitterpated, or whatever.  I was excited!  But \\"Twilight\\", the movie, left me wanting.  Wanting more of the book, wanting a new cast, wanting more color and less blue tinge, wanting more special special-effects...basically wanting a do over.  As a true fan, I actually felt robbed.  What could have been so awesome, was so not!<br /><br />But faced with no other choice, I accepted what wasn't and moved on to the anticipation of \\"New Moon\\".  And \\"New Moon\\" was better, way better.  More color, better special effects, better directing, better abs, etc.  Clearly, more money in filmmaking has its advantages!<br /><br />Eclipse, the third book, is almost my favorite book in the series; Twilight remains number one, but Eclipse is a very close second, very close, like this close   .  I was excited for Eclipse to be turned into a movie and the improvements in \\"New Moon\\" from \\"Twilight\\" made the anticipation that much more sweet.<br /><br />I am happy to report that I was NOT disappointed.  \\"Eclipse\\" was a great movie!  It stayed true to the book and included all my favorite parts from the book.  The acting...well, still not great and I still wish we could start over with a new cast, but the rest of it was quite good.  This film also really earned it's PG-13 rating.  There was more romance, some sexual references, and a lot more violence.  Luckily decapitated and dismembered vampires don't bleed or some of those children in attendance might have been scarred for life.  But overall, casting aside, I would recommend \\"Eclipse\\" for any Twihard.  I think as a standalone the movies are lacking on the whole, but having the books as reference adds more depth for me.it's PG-13 rating.

I'm a big fan of Steven Wilson and PT.  I believe this is their best work and the first album a newbie should buy.  It's also the first album with Gavin Harrison, whose drumming is absolutely stellar on this album.  He was a true upgrade at that position...

Egan also has a special way of playing with plot, by including capsule summaries that jump ahead to reveal all that happens in a characters life.  These are like little pop songs... and some of them help string together the overall narrative.  It's pretty cool... anyone who likes thinking about music in society and how song infiltrates memory will like this book.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Not even worth 1 star! Their last album, Minutes To Midnight, was a total masterpiece - 5 stars - this is one lame piece of crap - not a single Rock song on it - just a bunch of sound collages and a few boring hip-hop tracks. If i were their record company, i would have rejected this outright. Really, really dissapointing.
0374158460|3.0|Franzen did a good job of developing the characters over the years this novel covers. However, it's not a book I would recommend.  There are 3 main characters in the story and I could not identify with any of them. In addition, I didn't feel sorry for any of them or ever care about any of them.  The 3 characters seemed to have no emotional growth during the story.  By the time I got to the end of the book I was exasperated with all 3 of them and felt relieved the book was over.     I'm not a pollyana who wants every book to have a message and I'm not insistant on having likeable characters, I just couldn't find anything good to say about this novel.  I read and enjoyed Olive Kitteridge and she wasn't a likeable character. However, she struggled to determine how she had gotten off track in her major relationships and it was interesting to see how things turned out for her.
B000PXUA5W|3.0|I bought this for my 7-year-old nephew since he recently started playing soccer. He absolutely loved it, however, the very next day, the clasp became loose and since he's 7 and is into sports, it constantly falls off. It will only be a matter of time before he loses it. While the design and idea of the watch is nice, the quality is pretty crappy.
B003L0VJF6|4.0|When I went to play this, I didn't know what to expect. Rather a unique project. I half expected an encore of a couple of Mozart arias after the Grieg!    Julia Fischer apparently has a well-deserved reputation as a violinist, although I have not heard much of her output on cd or dvd. On the basis of this program, she is much better on the violin than on the piano.    The Saint-Saens is very well done, very lyrical and warm, without being schmaltzy. It may not be the most challenging concerto to attempt, but it is very enjoyable when done like this.    The Grieg is another matter. I would call this a valiant attempt, not a rousing success; more of a journeyman approach than one for the ages. This is not to say it is poorly played, but it is missing those little touches - rubato, spaces between the notes and perfect pedal control that you get with the best players or ones who really know this piece. I listened to a couple of earlier cds by well-reviewed artists playing this piece, and the differences are not subtle.    The conductor Matthias Pintscher (better known as a composer than a conductor) was apparently a late substitute for Sir Neville Marriner, so it's hard to judge his talents based on this. Julia tries a little auxiliary conducting with her shoulders and head during the last movement of the Saint-Saens, so maybe she doesn't need a conductor!    The Junge Deutsche Philharmonie plays quite well for a youth group, if not at the exalted level of the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, but certainly much better than the Verbier Festival orchestra, who butchered the Sibelius 5th under Salonen.    There is a 46 minute documentary featuring Julia Fischer, where snippets of these performances are interspersed with insights into how she approaches her work. It's in German, so set up your subtitles. Whoever the guy is doing the narrative seems to have been plucked from old German newsreels from the 1930's! There is not much musical insight here, and perhaps a little moremusic - maybe some solo violin - would have been a better use for the extra 46 minutes.     All in all, an interesting disc, and probably one worth owning. As those of of us who buy classical orchestral dvds know, there isn't much new stuff coming out, other than reissues and blue ray versions of existing discs. Nobody minds plonking down $20 for anything Abbado does, but it pays to be skeptical when it comes to new releases featuring third string orchestras and/or conductors. We're not at the stage yet where we have multiple choices for a particular work - it's like the early days of cd, when we would buy any old performance just to have it on cd!     Thanks to everyone who takes the time to review these new releases!
0307269760|2.0|Oughf, it maybe me, but I want the stories to have a point... or to at least connect to each other.  I keep reading hoping they will, but have taken to reading reviews to find out they don't.  Sadly, I am not going to finish this book.  I am half way through and I have to put it down.  I am glad that others like it, but this is just not a book that moves me.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Gregory Porter's debut CD, WATER, is nothing short of AMAZING.  His phrasing is impeccable; his lyric sensibility is soul stirring; and his vocal ability is well defined.<br /><br />He makes you \\"hear' the standards with fresh new ears: But Beautiful and my favorite Skylark which Gregory delivers with astounding clarity and phrasing.  The opening tune, Illusion, is a love lament that is extremely poignant and delivered with truth.<br /><br />Africa's rhythms and beauty are refreshed with Pretty ... \\"walls made from sand, and tassles hang from castles and camels, and real caravans, lentils and rice seasoned with spice ....\\" the song is spicy and you will find yourself singing it as the notes, words and vision, float in your mind ....<br /><br />1960 What? is a historical, song about times in America when the Civil Rights movement was focused and hot.  He sings of Martin Luther Kings murder and the plight of a people here in America.  It's bold, it's truthful, and it's powerful.<br /><br />Lonely One is a love song approached from a different angle.  A must hear.  You will relate personally or through someone you know who has gone through \\"it\\".  The song is beautifully sung and leaves a message of keeping hope for healthy love alive.<br /><br />Water is the title track and it is also beautifully, skillfully and soulfully sung ......<br /><br />Gregory Porter is on track to become one of our \\"Legends\\", he was born in Cali and now resides in Brooklyn (we are claiming him on the East Coast now!).  You will not be disappointed.  You will be inspired to know that great vocalists with great lyrics and great music are still here ....  Sit back and listen to the music of Gregory Porter and do something nice for your friends, too - turn them on to him, what a great gift!
B00009W0WM|5.0|To be honest, even writing a review for this is daunting; I'm certain I'll have no words of praise to equal those that have already posted here, and even if I could, I'm sure my best effort would fall short to describe everything I love about \\"Casablanca\\".<br /><br />Arguably (although not from me) the greatest film ever shot, \\"Casablanca\\" was a timely tale about war-torn people and shattered romance that came about when the world itself was war-torn, and most people weren't thinking very romantic thoughts. I won't rehash the plot here, I assume you either know it, have heard of it, or read it in another review; I'll instead offer my opinion of why this movie deserves every accolade it has received.<br /><br />It is a wonderfully crafted tale of three people bound by both love and cruel fate; world-weary Rick Blaine, standing firmly shielded by his cynicism, determined to spit in the eye of the fates that have plagued his life; The lovely and unfortunate Isla Lund, divided forever between a love that nurtures and a love that burns; and her husband, the noble and daring Victor Lazlo, a caring man who, through an irrevocable destiny, finds himself having to share his love for his wife with the love of freedom, as he has come to represent the hope and fighting spirit of the people of Europe.<br /><br />I don't care who you are, there is something in one (and quite likely each) of these characters that you can find that you will relate to.<br /><br />Add to this a wealth of supporting characters; the crafty Captain Louis Renault, the menacing Major Strasser, the salacious Lugarte, the slick Ferrari, faithful Sam...even Sasha the bartender stays in your memory.  Each actor in this unequalled ensemble brims with talent to produce characters that are fleshed-out and given life, so much so that even in the much too short a time you spend in front of the screen, you feel these are people you know; people you CARE about...this extends to even the secondary characters in the film (the heartfelt plea of the young Bulgarian girl for herself and her husband is TRULY inspired).<br /><br />The acting talents and abilites of the three main cast members, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Heinreid as they live through one of the most heart-rending love triangles ever commited to posterity are excellence cubed; every emotion, no matter how subtle, is conveyed as clear and resolute as the ring of fine, Waterford crystal.<br /><br />The multiple subplots, all engrossing and demanding an investment of your emotion, are woven together masterfully; the Epstein brothers simply outdid themselves in terms of story, made even more amazing by the fact that it was largely written on the fly.  The dialogue is witty and simply amazing; it's no wonder that this film has so many lines that are now in the common vernacular; indeed spoken now by people who have never even seen the film.<br /><br />There's something here for everyone:  you have action, romance, intrigue, suspense, comedy...you name it, it's in here somewhere...and ultimately it all blends seamlessly into a story of true love, courage in the face of all odds, and redemption.<br /><br />Thank heaven that they mastered this excellent transfer in its original format, and didn't butcher it to appeal to the \\"widescreen\\" audience; there weren't widescreen films then, and you see it here as it was meant to be seen.  The sound is crisp, from the gentle notes of \\"As Time Goes By\\" to the thunderous affirmation of courage from \\"La Marseillaise\\".  The extra disc includes two insightful documentaries hosted by Lauren Bacall, the wife of the late Bogart, and also the Warner Brothers cartoon tribute \\"Carrot-blanca\\", as well as an episode of the short-lived television series.  Most interesting to me was the radio broadcast, featuring the three main stars, and the commentary from the children of Bogie and Bergman...pure gold.<br /><br />If you are human, you'll take something with you from \\"Casablanca\\" thatyou'll be glad to have.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|So, I normally don't do reviews, however, for this band I will. I originally heard their song Little Lion Man on VH1 and thought it had an intersting sound. I decided to check the album out and it's awesome. I really had no clue how to classify their sound. The main thing that caught my attention was the banjo. Now, I am not necessarily a fan of the banjo, but they make it work. But it's their use of banjo and the fact that they don't sound like country or bluegrass that had me a little clueless of what genre to call this band. Regardless of what they are, this album is awesome. There is not one song I don't love and the more I listen to the album the more I love it. All of the songs have a wonderfully unique sound, which is probably why I like them so much. If you like one of their songs, please listen to the rest of them, they are all amazing.
037571457X|5.0|5 stars!  Ordered the book and I recieved it 2 days before the expected delivery date.   I basically got it the day after I ordered the book. Recomend.
0743454537|2.0|The book was not in the best condition, the spine was bent many times and the cover and inside was worn.
B003TJ4YU6|4.0|Nice to see these fabled performances in the context of the complete shows. You can just play the Beatles' songs if you want to, of course, since there's not much else that's especially revelatory. Ed Sullivan was the master of the \\"variety show,\\" a long vanished form on television, and his eclecticism and un-pretentiousness are kind of refreshing. Remember that his Sunday-night show was supposed to have something for everybody, for the \\"whole family,\\" so there are magicians, and comedians, and \\"novelty acts\\" that, taken together, constitute the last link between Vaudeville and television. Ed genuinely liked the Beatles, and he went on to present many of the seminal acts in Rock and Roll on his show, which are all worth seeking out on DVD. It's fun to see the old commercials on this set, and the Pillsbury ads made me crave pancakes and biscuits. The Miami show showed the Beatles being a little sloppy, and they repeated some of their repertoire overmuch. But the last stuff, from 1965, was wonderful. I'd forgotten they actually did \\"I'm Down\\" on the show!  Highly recommended, obviously, for Beatle collectors.
0307591549|5.0|Simply put, this book is absolutely life changing.  I have had the distinct pleasure of seeing Shawn in person, but his book takes his principles to another level because how deep he is able to go.  I could not recommend a book any higher!
B000R9EG3Q|5.0|The book was in great condition. i got it on time for school to start so I was pleased.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Robert resurrects the name of his 60s band 'Band of Joy' for this album produced by Buddy Miller, guitarist on 2007's collaboration with Alison Krauss \\"Raising Sand\\". However, this isn't 'a back to the 60s' record, although some of the covers are from the 60s. In fact it's a very similar collection of songs to \\"Raising Sand\\", covers of old country, rockabilly, R&B and blues tracks, with a similar atmospheric sound - banjos and mandolins, with lashings of reverb and tremolo on the guitar. I really like the variety of the songs and the way that the producer creates a unifying overall sound from the disparate styles, similarly Robert's voice seems to fit all the different styles without compromising any of his usual vocal styings.<br /><br />I think that this is a more consistent album than \\"Raising Sand\\", although again chances have been taken and some songs work better than others, the best songs here are really excellent. My favourite tracks are the opening cover of Los Lobos' \\"Angel dance\\" and the following version of Richard Thompson's \\"House of cards\\", with 'Fairportesque' vocals from Patty Griffin. In fact I thought that Patty's backing vocals were really good throughout and I would have liked to have heard more of them. I also enjoyed the 50s country song \\"Falling in Love Again\\" (with Robert sounding a bit like Elvis), the 'Merseybeat' \\"You Can't Buy My Love\\" and the haunting \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\". It will be interesting to see if this record sells as well as \\"Raising Sand\\".
B003HARV3Y|3.0|\\"Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------  The first film in a presumably long franchise, this adaptation of the popular fantasy book series has moments of wonder, balanced by hours of tedium and mediocrity. A lot of the film seems underbudgeted - the acting in scene after scene falls flat, as if the director kept saying, \\"Eh. That's good enough. They'll still buy tickets.\\"      The same was true with the special effects and set design: eh, good enough, I guess. While some attention was lavished on Medusa's snake-y tresses, and Hades' demonic fire was cool, many monster sequences had a Harryhausen-esque clumsiness that's surprising to see in this day and age. Finally, the script was atrocious -- dull, flat, overly full of exposition, short on emotional resonance. A lot of this had to do with direction and pacing: Chris Columbus simply doesn't let scenes breathe, he's in too much of a rush to meet his deadlines and get his product out to market. For example, when Percy and his gang realize they've been tricked and that one of them has to stay in the Underworld, hardly anyone bats an eyelash when Percy's sidekick Grover volunteers to become eternally damned. Oh, okay man. Bummer, but I'll come back and get you out. Later, dude, gotta roll. Fight sequences have a similarly lax feel: Minotaur? Dead in sixty seconds. Fire demon? Don't worry; it'll go away soon.  Zeus hassling you?  Tell him to chill, dude.    I dunno. I guess this film was \\"okay,\\" but if you're going to make a fantasy epic, why not make it, you know... epic?  Or fantastic? Why settle for just okay?  (Axton)
B00006LPER|5.0|What some people might find unusual about the story of The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste) is how common it really is.  The vast numbers of sexually \\"complicated\\" people exist within our society and their individual tales are rarely discussed in popular culture.  Michael Haneke steps foward boldly to correct this problem.  Isabelle Huppert's Erika is an exceptionally talented artist and her needs are specific and frightening to those who do not understand the context of her nearly 50 years of life.  How can anyone understand anyone sexually?  It takes years to understand another individual, and the tragedy of The Piano Teacher is that the character Walter gives up on Erika before development can occur.  Frightened people do this in the \\"dating\\" world everyday.  I personally thank Michael Haneke and Elfriede Jelinek for this inspiring story every time I come home from another failed attempt at romance.  It keeps me going.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|This book--and now the audio version of it--has given me a perspective of the man, his dreams and his politics, as no other autobiographical book by any other author has ever been able to do.  Even his \\"no-drama Obama\\" persona (the face we see on our television screen) makes sense in light of his zigzag journey through countries, continents and conflicts (personal, ancestral, household, religious, academic ... and even language and culture) and at least one mentor at Harvard who helped shape an understanding of American law and politics from the jumble that he brought to Harvard's prestigious Law School from almost a quarter century of what had to be a confusing and difficult growth from childhood to adolescence to adult.<br /><br />It was at Harvard, I believe, that he was taught to think things out and look at opposing views from all sides--something that could not have otherwise arisen from the mishmash of experiences and combinations of acceptance followed by rejection followed by acceptance followed by rejection followed by ... ad infinitum.<br /><br />His two to three years as a community organizer in Chicago helped, but the discipline of the Harvard Law School was paramount, from my reading of this book.<br /><br />Interestingly, I knew more about John McCain's father, having worked as a science advisor for him while he was our CINCPAC in the late 60's, but knew far less about young John (McCain)--other than that he was an honorable (and jack rabbit) Navy pilot who spent torturous years at the infamous Hanoi Hilton--than I feel  I've come to know about Barack Obama in the last couple of weeks while reading one book that he originally wrote more than a full decade before he became our 44th president.<br /><br />He is not narcissistic!<br /><br />He is a unique product of a beautiful and diversely populated country--a country second to none in its ability to produce leaders such as Barack Obama ... who, I believe, will be considered one of our very best looking back from the Twenty-second Century and beyond.<br /><br />One small nit: The full title (Deams from my Father) didn't seem quite right, considering that he had almost no connection with his father and seemingly very little from his mother, who although she was an influence of sorts, was seldom around to assist in molding his character.  Dreams from God-Knows-Where would have been a more appropriate title, I think.<br /><br />Still, that one nit is not worthy of reducing my rating by even half a star.beyond.

B00337KM2S|4.0|I think the premise of this movie is hilarious enough with George Clooney working for a company that goes around the country firing people.  Then they try to modernize it to make firing people more \\"efficient\\" and cost effective.  The movie is very funny and fun to watch with a little bit of romantic comedy that's not too cheesy.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I discovered the Jack Reacher novels when I went on vacation in July and have read them all in less than 2 months.  I liked the fact that I could read them in the order I chose without relying on previous information.<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved this book (Gone Tomorrow).  This is my second favorite Lee Child book, the Killing Floor is still my favorite.  Reacher is still analytical and at the top of his game.  Lee Child pulled you in from page one with a  random act of violence.  Since I am a history buff, the violence did not bother me.  In any case, I applauded the fact that Reacher did not act the lone wolf until the end.  I think it was brilliant that Lee did not make him answer the phone, that way he did not know there was a twientieth person.  It would have spoiled the whole ending.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Reacher novel.
0807014273|5.0|This book is great because it contains two parts, one about the author's experiences in the Nazi concentration camps and then goes into his theory on what drives man which was integral in his survival.  Reading a book that stems from the originator's personal experiences such that it has direct applicability really helps it hit home.  It's definitely a different way to look at things than traditional psychoanalysis and gets you thinking from a different perspective.  Great read, short and to the point.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I would like to get this book for the kindle but I cannot bring myself to pay 50% more for the Kindle edition versus the physical book.<br />Hopefully these publishers will wake up and realize that they can sell an E-book at a lower sticker price than the dead tree version and still make plenty of profit.  If they are not careful these publishers are going to price themselves out of business!!!!!!!!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|This is very impressive on blue ray.  my family really enjoys this move.  It seems like all thought has already been said about this latest installment of the Batman series. I was uprised that Jack Nicholason could actually be out done as the best joker. Everything is present in the movie, viewers: good script, great direction and top notch CGI. You'll want to watch this a couple of times to catch all the politcal nuiances-whether you agree with them or not. Just pop you some popcorn, kick up your feet and enjoy.  The graphics make it even more interesting to watch and are absolutely stunning.
0439023513|2.0|Yes it is powerfully anti-war. Yes it is an example of sacrifice. But when readers can no longer identify with the characters, the book loses its impact. The interesting thing about being human is humanity's capacity for a variety of emotions and behaviors even in the most dire situations. It seems like Katniss' personal life became totally unimportant to her and to the story as a whole, which turns her into a mere mechanical device. I guess if the message is that war destroys people utterly, that's perfectly true and fine--but eh. Still not as full or enlightening or illuminating as it could have been. It would have been interesting and novel to see Katniss' personal life and internal struggles explored in the midst and context of all of the other happenings, but the author seems to have sacrificed her possiblility of being a multifaceted character for that for one big hammer blow of WAR SUCKS.
0374158460|4.0|If you liked the correcrtions you will probably like this too. As one reviewer said it is a midlife crisis, but a funny one. Is the book Shakespear? No but it is highly entertaining if you are willing and able to laugh at yourself as well as people you know, because the characters in this book ARE people you know. Would have been great beach reading!
B003V5PPZG|4.0|To start off, this is a million times better than Minutes To Midnight..  It is Linkin Park's KID A, for sure!    Let me start off with my dislikes:    1. it's too short.  -there are 6 interlude type tracks on it, that really dont add too much to the album. those 6 are basically ambient sounds that u will not remember.  which basically leaves the album with 9 songs. just wayy too short of an album.     Other than that, I don't have any other problems with it. It's that good!    Likes:    1. It's consistent as hell. To me, it sounds very focused. There was too much style going on, on their last release. I was often wondering what they were trying to go for, as far as sound. I just didnt get it.  2. The flow on the hip hop tracks are very nice! Deff. got a jamaican flow to them.. Yes! Jamaican, but it works!!!  3. They manage to blend some of Chester's screaming vocals amongst the electronic music, perfectly!! It all works; nothing is out of place.  4. Production is top notch. Rick Rubin hits it outta the park, and deserves a grammy for Production..  5. BLACKOUT.. I did not like this song at first, but then I realized how cool this song sounds!!!! Chester's vocals sound like they've been thrown through every effects modular known to man!!! It sounds cool as hell.. Very Nine Inch Nails!! By a mile, the coolest sounding track on the album.  6. There are very few \\"electronic\\" albums I can stand. This one I can keep in my car for a very long time!      All in all, it's their best album! It's going to be a sight to see this stuff performed live. I don't know what it's going to look like, but Im looking forward to it!
0380730405|5.0|This is a hauntingly great story.  The first thing I did when I read the very last sentence was to start from the beginning and reread the first chapter.  It is one of those books that makes you think about it after it ends.  What a Classic.
B00001SIES|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is the best Muse album and by far my favorite.<br /><br />The band is a little more raw and less electronic than their new albums.  This reminds me of old Radiohead (Pablo Honey, OK Computer) with a little more hard rock action tossed in.  The songs flow very well and range from very fast and uptempo to mellow yet soulful.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece!  It's worth it for Sunburn, Muscle Museum, Cave, and Uno.  Plus the vocals in Sober are just crazy!  They don't hit the same highs in the newest two albums (seems lately they're trying to play to the bigger audience).  So if you really liked Absolution, then this is the same vein, without the two filler songs in Absolution (Interlude and Intro.... yeah what was up with that?).<br /><br />Buy this album, you won't regret it!
B003F3NE1Q|4.0|First let me start off by saying that I have seen every episode of Grey's Anatomy and Season 6 is by far my favorite.  I didnt give it 5 stars because the last 4-5 unaired scenes in the bonuses section on disk 5 dont work, I tried 3 different players. Anyone else have this problem?
B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|To put all to rest:<br /><br />I am viewing Ran from the Criterion collection on my laptop while watching the Blu-Ray on my Toshiba LCD 1080p through a PS3.  I have seen the Criterion version at least 3 times on my TV prior to this viewing.<br /><br />There is not much difference really. (Though my nod goes to the Criterion for the slightly ~ and I stress slightly ~ better subtitles and translations)<br /><br />The picture is great on the Criterion version; but the movie is a little crisper and cleaner on the Blu-Ray (though not truly HD ~ it still retains the original look).  For those purists, I don't think that the clarity of either version really changes the vision Kurosawa had when he created this masterpiece.<br /><br />The subtitles work just fine on both, though there are a few slight differences in actual wording.  For example Criterion: \\"Lady Kaede, forgive me for disrobing in front of you\\" ; Blu-Ray: \\"Lady Kaede, I'm going to be naked\\". (which is the more accurate translation!)  The slight changes in dialogue don't really change the movie, the meanings are still the same.  I have studied Japanese for a long time and it is one of those languages which doesn't translate exactly into English, so any translation will have to adjust accordingly.  This doesn't happen very often, and is really only noticeable if you are playing the Criterion version right next to the Blu-Ray (as I did).<br /><br />There were a few instances where the wording had to be changed (on both versions) to make sense in English but again, if it were translated exactly it would make little sense to English speakers.  \\"This event which you refer to was not by me done\\" would be the literal translation for \\"I didn't do it\\".  Or \\"there sit\\" is what Kaede says in Japanese but sounds better as \\"Please sit there\\".  So I am a little forgiving with the Japanese translations (unlike French which translates very well into English yet is often butchered).<br /><br />There were three instances where the subtitles did not appear when someone spoke, but these were all at times where the speaker was either upset or talking over someone so the actual meaning of the dialogue is not very important.  They also tend to not post subtitles when someone is shouting a person's name: \\"Kurogane! Kurogane!\\" means the same either way.  =)<br /><br />Basically either version works.  Since the Blu-ray is currently cheaper, that would be the route I recommend.  Though you might find it useful to rent both from Netflix and watch them next to each other or at least one after the other.  If you don't have a blu-ray player go Criterion; the Criterion is actually slightly better in my opinion, just shell out the extra money.<br /><br />Just AVOID the Masterworks DVD edition.  It is full of defects and mis-translations and the subtitles hit off screen quite often., but these were all at times where the speaker was either upset or talking over someone so the actual meaning of the dialogue is not very important.

B000GUJYRE|5.0|After hearing lots of good things about this CD, I could not resist buying it.  And I have not been the least bit disappointed.  I had already been impressed with Haitink's stunning recording with the RCO and Perahia ([[ASIN:B0000026O8 Beethoven: The Five Piano Concertos]]).  Haitink's conducting here is vibrant and full of vitality.  The LSO's sound is marvelously well balanced.  While these are live recordings, the recording quality is astounding.  Haitink seems to have taken a more personal, intimate approach than most.  This has upset some reviewers.  I do not see how this could possibly be a setback.  While there are certainly other recordings that give a more powerful \\"full orchestra\\" effect, few, if any, can match the miniscule detail that is pulled from the orchestra by Haitink.  The strings have all of the LSO's usual lush, darker tone.  The woodwinds are fabulous; they give us beautiful, clear playing.  While the brass may be a tad weak, they still deliver powerful excitement.  The timpani is unbelievable good; it's strong and clear without being too loud.  The LSO gives performances that will put you on-the-edge-of-your-seat in the fast movements and soothing, sublime readings of the slow movements.<br /><br />This certainly is one of the best recordings of the fantastic symphonies.  One may also want to get the Rattle/Vienna ([[ASIN:B000084T5W Beethoven: Complete Symphonies; Sir Simon Rattle/Vienna Philharmonic]]), the Abbado/Berlin ([[ASIN:B00004YZ33 Beethoven - Die Symphonien (Symphonies 1-9) / Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic]]) among others.  But this may possibly remain your favorite recording of the masterpieces.  I do not hesitate to give it my highest recommendation.

0307454541|1.0|This book takes forever setting the background. I have forced myself to read 186 pages and still don't care about any of the characters.  Everyone says it will get better....you shouldn't have to read 1/3 of a book before it gets interesting.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Wow. I know they were trying to go in a different direction, but wow. I love, love, love the first two cd's and like parts of the others. If you are the same way, you are going to be VERY dissappointed. What happened to the heavy guitar? Or any guitar at all? Still trying to digest how dissappointed I am. Buyer beware!!
B0025KVLU6|3.0|3 1/2      Rock's penultimate double lp can work that way when taken from a conceptual track-by-track basis in its original context, but there is no denying a fair amount of relative, if constantly intriguing, filler and a lackluster conclusion when stacked against rarer, higher writings.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|This is a great complete set of recordigns of Mahler's work - the version of Symphony No.1 is possibly one of the best versions I heard on CD - I have several versions of Symphony No. 1 - the other superb recording I have is with Eliahu Imbal conducting the Frankfurt Radio Symphony orchestra.<br /><br />My other favourite is of course Symphony No.8 and this is just a great version<br /><br />Even though these are older recordings - the quality, sound, perfomance are unmatched.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed listening to vocal music of Mahler - with soem famous voices singing - including Dieter Fischer-Dieskau, Brigitte Fassbaender,  Christa Ludwig, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and the inimitable Kathleen Ferrier (it is a pity she died so young).<br /><br />For me this was a a great purchase - and a must for any Mahler afficionado in this the 150th anniversay of his birth in 1860 - it is also a pity that he died so young in 1911 from a heart condition that today would be easily managed and controlled.  The body of work that he left behind in small but an major force in classical musical hisotry
B0016OOM7Q|4.0|It came a lot earlier than I expected (15 days instead of estimated 30 from USA to Serbia). The packaging is disaster, it came in a box in which I could fit my turntable and still there would be plenty of space. Because of that, edges of the cover are damaged. Inner sleeves are paper, not plastic and very bad quality. Also, stickers on the records are also very bad, they look faded. But I like the candy coloured vinyl and since I got it for less than 7$ excluding shipping (3 12\\" lp's and cd) I'm satisfied
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I read the book first, and then checked out the movie.  Of course, I was curious to see the casting, and after learning that Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen were in the movie, I instantly associated Scarlett with Ann and Natalie with Mary.  Nothing against either actress, as I think they both have a lot of good qualities, but if I was the one in charge of casting, that would seem the most natural way to set up this film.  As it turns out, the reverse is true.  A lot of people seem to be unhappy with the casting choices in this movie, and in my opinion, much of this could have been alleviated if only the casting of the sisters had been reversed.    Not much point in asking for it now, as it is a mistake that is done and over with.  Just a shame when sometimes intuition and art take a back seat to hollywood.
0143036424|5.0|I stumbled across these in Powell's Bookstore and bought them because the graphics were great. Who says you can't judge a book by . . . . ? Once I got past the cover, I was delighted to discover a series that does not disappoint. All the details of a great series are in place (besides the obvious): food, weather, tiny quirks (love the post-its, Craig!). Buy the series but don't expect to pass them along. The book jackets make them instant collectables.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I had high expectations going in and this DVD exceeded them in every way.  Beautifully filmed.  Great sound quality.  What a talented musicion with fantastic presentation.  This is one gorgeous DVD!
0553805371|1.0|The book starts with the phrase \\"Philosophy is Dead\\".  Quite an arrogant claim, and a ridiculous one at that.     The book claims that a God is not necessary to explain the existence of the universe.  but on the last page it states \\"Because of gravity, the Universe can and will create itself out of nothing\\"....hmmmmm....so it is ridiculous to claim that God created the Universe, but somehow gravity created the universe out of nothing?  Which claim sounds more ridiculous?    Also, this book claims that free will is a total illusion, that we are simply biochemical robots.  Although earlier claiming that philosophy is dead, Hawking and Mlodinow take the philosophy of Hume to a fantastical level.  The book is very inconsistent.    Dont waste your time or money on this one.
B000HT386M|2.0|I like a lot of Sandler's stuff but this movie is pretty tedious.  The first half of the movie is more comedic while the second long drawn out half turns into a sappy drama.  It's gimmick of fast forwarding through life's troublesome parts wears thin by the time the movie is half over.  What's left is a predictable ending about taking time to smell the flowers.. even when they don't smell so great.. You'll feel like doing a little fast forwarding yourself I wager.      Much, much better than \\"Click\\" would be \\"The Waterboy\\", \\"Bulletproof\\", \\"The Wedding Singer\\", \\"Mr Deeds\\", \\"Funny People\\", even \\"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry\\".  \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" was great.  I've yet to see \\"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\\" but that looks fun.      \\"Click\\" is a predictable, over-sentimental gimmick movie that does about as much as it can with Sandler and a weak script  (a much better example of a movie in this genre would be \\"Liar Liar\\", \\"Groundhog Day\\", or even \\"A Christmas Carol\\" where Scrooge realizes the error of his ways - this theme has been done to death).  On the other hand, if you liked Sandler's more simple-minded stuff, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Anger Management, you may enjoy this movie.  And while I don't mind crude humour  and innuendo (this movie does get a few laughs in that department before it gets into its arduous second half), it's not really a \\"family movie\\" for kids as some say.  Granted, it's not so great for adults either, but for different reasons.  Apparently this movie has its fans though - then again, so did Anger Management.
B000XK7P7S|5.0|I'm not entirely sure what Frank exactly means. I originally thought it had to do with her blunt honesty, but a friend told me she's a huge fan of Sinatra and named her dog (I think he's the one on the cover) after him.<br /><br />Anyway, Amy's voice is amazing and while her vocals are reminiscent of Billie, Sarah, and Ella, she manages to pull off her own style. Something I love about this album is that it's very straight forward and what you see is what you get. Her second album Back To Black, while also good, relies too heavily on the 40's and 50's jazz sound and sometimes borders on gimmicky. Frank pulls from the past, but sounds very much of today.<br /><br />First up is the debut single \\"Stronger Than Me\\". Over a wobbly hip hop beat, Amy complains about her \\"lady boy\\" who needs to man up and stop letting her be the guy in the relationship. Amy's personality shines through and makes this an enjoyable track. \\"You Sent Me Flying\\" starts off with a disco meets piano beat and is carried by a vocal brimming with regret. Amy getting kicked to the curb never sounded so good. Who knew? \\"Cherry\\" at first sounds like a relationship with the another girl, but has a twist no one saw coming.<br /><br />\\"Take The Box\\" is the first song I ever heard from this album and got me hooked. With a shout out to Frank (the dog or the singer) in the chorus, Amy sings about a love affair that has ended badly, but she can't completely let her guy go. The music is top notch and intoxicating. \\"In My Bed\\" finds the singer letting a guy know that she only wants sex from him, but not his heart over a Nas beat. I read that it was a single and it deserved to be.<br /><br />I can't compare Amy's cover of \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" to any others, but this reggae tinged song is a highlight. \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" is just a love song. Not to weed or booze, but to a guy. Weird, I know. I love the late night cricket chirping feel to the production.<br /><br />In \\"I Heard Love Is Blind\\", Amy makes excuses for her cheating ways. \\"It's ok, honey. I thought about you when I came.\\" I wonder how that one went over. \\"October Song\\" is a bouncy, bright tribute to her deceased bird who is now \\"reborn like Sarah Vaughan\\". She can even make a song about her dead bird sound amazing.<br /><br />By the end of the album, Amy seems tired of her hunger for bad men in the hip-hop influenced \\"What Is It About Men\\", but she falls for another one on the \\"Chicago\\" sounding \\"Amy Amy Amy\\". When will this girl learn?<br /><br />Two gripes from me. One, I liked \\"Pumps\\" on the first few listens, but now I just skip it. Very little replay value for me. Second, the fact that both hidden tracks (which I love) are literally hidden behind \\"Amy Amy Amy\\" and the outro. Why not make them separate tracks? And where is the World War II era sounding \\"Help Yourself\\"? Anyway, \\"Brother\\" is a heartfelt track about the singer's own troubled sibling and \\"Mr. Magic\\" adds beautiful lyrics to Grover Washington's 70's instrumental classic.<br /><br />I really hope that Amy will clean up her life and return to this type of music. She has too much talent to let it all go to waste.ok, honey. I thought about you when I came.\\" I wonder how that one went over. \\"October Song\\" is a bouncy, bright tribute to her deceased bird who is now \\"reborn like Sarah Vaughan\\".

B003D83DPA|4.0|...but I love this Blu-Ray's image. As some people already pointed out, it was filmed in 16 mm film under low light conditions. That explains the amount of grain and the hair you can see intruding in some shots. The point is: after all this is film, the colors and the black levels are superior. I add to this something very personal: I LOVE film grain. To me, it is much more beautiful than any digital video artifact. It makes the image feel warmer, and the whole experience of the concert more moving.    The audio mix is, of course, superb. I only have one problem with it: some important piano parts in Once upon a Time in the West are almost unheardable here. Otherwise, quite perfect. Nice bass level.
B003UYUQZW|3.0|The acting is nothing great here, although it is mildly entertaining to watch the story.  It all seems very familiar, though.  A family misunderstanding, a young man and woman who end up attracted to each other though they loathe each other at first; a magical dagger filled with a time-bending sand; desert vistas; elaborate production design; improbable stunts and action.    Okay to watch once.
B000000XCF|5.0|Anyone who's a fan of stripped down, melodic roots rock absolutely *has* to be a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Willy & the Poor Boys happens to be one of the bands best efforts.    John Fogerty has never been so soulful, and the rest of the band has never sounded so darn good.  The songwriting is, believe it or not, a notch higher than usual as well.      Everybody knows \\"Down By the Corner\\" because it's an instant classic, but not many people are familiar with at least half of this terrific album.      A song that *definitely* leaves a lasting impression is \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\".  Talk about a song that packs an incredible amount of energy and totally rocks in the same way as, say, what the Rolling Stones were doing at the time.  WOW!      And then -to totally mess with your mind- the band switches gears and gives an emotionally memorable track in \\"Cotton Fields\\".  This song is truly spectacular in every single way.  \\"Poorboy Shuffle\\" has great harmonica playing, and that's about the only thing the song has going for it, but honestly, that's all it *needs*.    \\"Feelin' Blue\\" has a rhythm that might remind someone of CCR's version of \\"I Heart It Through the Grapevine\\".  I love the guitar playing and the vocals about equally here.  We all know \\"Fortune Son\\" and it's probably the craziest song here in terms of raw energy.   It's also arguably more popular than \\"Down By the Corner\\" these days.      \\"Don't Look Now\\" reminds me of Elvis Presley, and \\"The Midnight Special\\" continues to be one of those forgotten classics in that, you will recognize the melody upon hearing it, but probably not just by looking at the song title.    \\"Side o' the Road\\" is completely groovy with the splendid rhythm section and the great guitar soloing.  This is definitely a great mood song.  \\"Effigy\\" has a vocal melody that nearly makes me cry, seriously.  It's THAT good.    Overall, you need Willy & the Poor Boys just as much as Cosmo's Factory.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I know why you want this controller. The Dualshock 3's are too small and cramp your adult sized hands. You envy Xbox owners for having a comfortable controller and you want the same for your PS3.  Unfortunately, the shape of this controller is the only thing that is good about it. The dead zones in the analog sticks make this controller a failure.    The dead zones were noticeable from the first second and are the biggest let down of this controller. The Dualshock 3's analog sticks are soft but smooth and accurate. The Xbox's are firm but consistent and accurate.  The Pro Elite's are firm, kinda jerky, and inaccurate.  For FPS and 3rd person shooters, this is a nightmare.    The L2/R2 triggers are an improvement only in the sense that they curve outward. Other than that, they are mushy and are hardly an improvement over the DS3.    The textured grips are hard, pointy and pointless. They leave imprints on my palms and become irritating.  I do have a tight grip on my controllers and this probably makes it worse but I don't see that changing anytime soon.     If you've been looking for a Xbox 360 type controller for the PS3, be warned that this controller mimics the shape well but everything else falls short. It is more comfortable but its usefulness is limited by its inaccurate analog sticks. I hope to sell it soon and would rather go back to the DualShocks. Good idea POWER A but such poor execution.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|I started out watching the extended version and was very disappointed in the hd picture quality. Whatever they were trying to do with this version of the movie didn't work out well. They went for extended contrast, which gives it deep blacks but no shadow detail. The film is not sharp.<br /><br />On the other hand, unlike the one-star aggro people on here, I thought the theatrical hd transfer was excellent. Contrast was properly set up and the movie is sharp.
B002QN7PU2|1.0|TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Show! And yes from cable TV this series was banned for many reasons and both CBS Showtime's sister network would also be reprimanded if this show ever aired prime time on other channels! The main character is so disgusting and despicable its not even worth talking or writing about. You want a good show check out Rescue Me, or House, or heck even old sci-fi series like the Invisible Man and Star Trek are leaps and bounds better than this garbage!

0439023513|2.0|What a disappointing ending. Huge plot build-up over three books for the final heroine vs. arch-villain encounter and all of a sudden it takes a sharp turn into morphling land. Seems like Suzanne was trying too hard to avoid a cliché ending and ended up ruining the story for almost everyone.     I'm going to rewrite the ending below for the rest of us (cliff notes format):    Katniss was being pushed forward by the crowd into the courtyard when she saw Peeta walking (voluntarily) with a group of Peacekeepers towards the Capitol building. She presses through the crowd and makes a final desperate assault on the group right before they enter the doors of the Capitol, killing some of the guards but running out of ammo as the last remaining guard lifts his weapon to fire on her. Katniss closes her eyes and hears the shot, reopens to see Gale by her side, who arrived to her rescue in the nic of time. As she's taking this in an entire platoon of Peacekeepers burst out from within the Capitol building. To Katniss' horror Peeta without hesitation raises his weapon and shoots Gale point blank, spinning him around and back down in the crowd. He then levels his gun at Katniss, but the head PeaceKeeper commands him to halt. Peeta robotically obeys and lays down his weapon. Peeta and Katniss are ushered into Snow's abode, events are retold from the perspective of the PeacKeepers, and Snow gloats triumphantly while Katniss hisses in rage at Peeta. Snow takes Peeta and Katniss to the Capitol building balcony and has his TV crew film live, which places the entire war on breathless hold as everyone sees their beloved Mockinjay in Snow's possession. Snow then asks Peeta to do the honors and execute Katniss on live TV, to which Peeta responds in the affirmative, holding Snow's gun to her head and pulling the trigger. Nothing happens of course because Snow was testing him, and now hands him a loaded gun. Peeta appears to repeats the action but fires on Snow instead, wounding him. Katniss jumps on Snow and together they fall off the balcony, Snow to his death and Katniss caught by Peeta at the last second. Katniss prepares to let go but Peeta explains that he had shot Gale in the shoulder to protect him from the PeaceKeepers and had been trained by Haymitch and Beetres(?) on how to differentiate between a loaded and empty gun. He explains that it was a desperate act in order to save her because he could not live without her. That's when Katniss knows for sure that she loves Peeta, and they embrace and kiss on live TV as both sides cheer, and the war is over.     Epilogue: Turns out Finnick survived the assault by the reptilians and is now a happy father of three. Prim has followed in her mother's footsteps and has become a reknown healer. Johanna marries Gale, and Katniss and Peeta recover from their ordeal and live happily ever after. Haymitch runs for president, and the world of Panem(?) is whole again, if slightly less sober.    The End
B0028KCH5G|1.0|Everything about this show and its pathetic freaky character is really pointless. I saw a really freaky ad for this show recently. His wife there is all slaughtered in the bathtub in her own blood and that freakish moron of a main character finds his baby sitting down on the floor covered in BLOOD! The best thing about this ad is you see the police arrive at his house just as he runs away. Hopefully this series is ending soon. Watch Rescue me for a good series!
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|The book has a large number of very useful tips on how to get across messages really well. Since the book often refers to Steve Jobs's presentations on YouTube, the examples in the book become much less abstract and are therefore much easier to remember. There is simply a lot of material around to see what is meant, and after each chapter you look at a Jobs' presentation from a slightly different perspective.    I don't agree with the statement in the book that you can learn and practice to obtain the same charisma as Jobs has. Nevertheless I am very sure that many of us can improve their presentation skills with quantum leaps if at least some of the ideas in the book are put into practice. The book is well written and fun to read.    One thing that really started to annoy me in the book is the compulsive enumeration of dates. Every time it left me with the one question that appears in the book many times: 'Why should I care?'.
B000QUCNOU|4.0|David Fincher did a fine job with his portrayal of the serial killer \\"the Zodiac\\" in this film. After researching this story extensively this movie really rang true and depicted the events in an authentic and true fashion. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a really good performance as the lead and Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo both give fine supporting performances. I think there was less hype about this movie and it was underrated because young people were probably expecting something graphic like SE7EN, when this is a more in depth unfolding of a story than a blood and guts movie. In any event it is a commonly overlooked film that is extremely well made and it will have you engaged from start to finish with twists and turns.
B001AGXEAG|1.0|I did not find this movie at all entertaining. I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton but I though it might make a cute Halloween movie. Didn't do it for me. It also says the \\"F\\" word and that is not a word I care to listen to or allow my children to listen to in my home.  It seems that things that I found fun and entertaining in my youth are no longer fun and entertaining to me. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch as a family I would not suggest this one.
0143118420|1.0|After hearing a little bit about the book, I was so excited to read it.  I was expecting a book that would tell the story of a strong-willed woman who was a survivor and was able to learn valuable lessons from her past hardships.  Instead, I found it to be the story of a whiny, priviledged woman who created her own problems and expected everyone to feel sorry for her.  I certianly understand the impact depression can have on a person, but I don't think this was the case with her.It was torture trying to get through it and I finally had to just put it down because I could not connect with the book.
6305428042|5.0|This is how a Halloween movie should be made. Fabulous acting, noting to scary for the little ones and we never get sick of watching it. I am on my second copy as my kids have ruined the first. Bette Middler is amazing in her role! A real treat for young and old. Well, older!

B000VBIGD6|2.0|I was a teenager when this was realeased and what was funny to me then is not funny to me now. I purchased this after not watching it for many, many years and I was so dissappointed in it that I have not watched it since. It was a total waste of time and money for me. It contains foul language which in my opinion ranges from moderate to offensive, with the \\"F\\" word being used and there are some sexually oriented scenes which in my opinion are innappropriate. There is also a cat that gets electrocuted. I am listing the issues I have with this movies so that anyone else who is considering purchasing it as a family film or anyone who might possibly be offended by its contents will know what they are getting. I wish I had done some reading before I had purchased- it would have saved me some money. Now- with that being said- this is my review and my opinion of the movie. If your opinion differs please feel free to write your own review and be respectful enough to refrain from leaving ugly comments on mine.
B001S86J0I|5.0|Tim Allen, (\\"Home Improvement\\"), Sigorney Weaver, (The \\"Alien\\" films), Tony Shaloub, (\\"Monk\\"), and Alan Rickman, (usually known for playing very serious and often villanous roles, including the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1991's \\"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\\",   are \\"amongst the stars\\", in this wonderful, funny, and totally   delightful comedy, called \\"GALAXY QUEST\\".  They are \\"Amongst The Stars\\" in more ways than one!  Playing stars of a cancelled TV science fiction show, they are first seen at a sci-fi convention, honouring them and their show, surrounded by adoring fans.  Unknown to the stars of the cancelled show, however, (and their fans as well), is the fact that, amongst the crowd of humnan fans, are some REAL aliens!  They are \\"good guy\\" aliens, being menaced by \\"bad guy\\"  aliens -- and they think the TV show was real!  They think that the stars of the show are NOT actors - but actually the space heros they portray.  These ET alien good guys want -- nay, NEED -- the help of what they perceive to be Human good guys....and QUICK!    Thus begins this truly funny, truly original, and truly engrossing film.  Full of \\"Star Trek\\"-like references, (the soup which the actor who played the Spock-like alien on the cancelled TV show, (Alan Rickman), is given to drink is a stand-out!), clever dialogue, and a very followable story which continues, (very logically!) to give excitement, enjoyment, and laughs, from beginning to end, this film is truly a winner!  Because of the great script and story, good directing, suspenseful music, and actors who are not only good, but  take their roles, and the movie's story seriously....whilst still having fun, there is a fine believability in this story which, sadly, is missing in far too many science fiction/fantasy/horror stories today.    THIS is the film to show those you know who do not like science fiction, but whom you would like to like science fiction.  Because it's not just a sci-fi flick.  It is a true comedy, mixing elementsof screwball comedy and slapstick comedy, with the aforesaid great story and script, and fine production values.  It's not a film to learn from -- just a film to enjoy.  Then again -- maybe it IS a film to learn from.  Watching it, one learns how great comedies are made! : )
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I was two rows back, on the floor, at the Kingston Ontario show in May of 2009 when Cohen played The Partisan.  It sent chills up my spine, made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It was that good.<br /><br />Songs From the Road contains a Helsinki performance of The Partisan that's so intense it did it once again. \\"Through the graves the wind is blowing. Freedom soon will come\\".<br /><br />In addition there are seven other songs that weren't on Live In London (only four are repeated). Taken together they round out the record of what must be one of the most amazing tours ever. All performed by a man in his mid seventies.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br />Apart from The Partisan, the standouts for me are Famous Blue Raincoat, Lover, Lover, Lover, and Waiting for the Miracle. Famous Blue Raincoat includes what must be one of the most sultry and soulful sax solos ever laid down by the incomparable Dino Soldo. Lover, Lover, Lover throbs with the insistency of unrequited desire, set against the flowing virtuosity of Javier Mas. And Waiting For the Miracle broods with an almost unimaginable darkness.<br /><br />The only song that doesn't work for me is Avalanche (\\"I stepped into an avalanche, it covered up my soul\\"). The original version on Songs of Love and Hate is defined by a raw and menacing cello line which here is absent. Considering that the musicians in Cohen's band seem each to play a multiplicity of instruments, it doesn't seem like it would have been a stretch for musical director Roscoe Beck to put down the 5 string electric bass and contrabass to pick up a cello for the part.<br /><br />But it was not to be...
B003V5PPZG|2.0|After giving this album a run through I decided that it wasn't for me and figured that I wouldn't ever listen to it again. Well, today I decided to give it another try and maybe figure out what exactly it was that turned me off. There have been reviews comparing this album to Rage Against the Machine, which was one of the reasons why I gave it another chance. Lyrically, the album is extremely political, however, what bothers me most is that the message is often times lost in the music. Their last album, Minutes to Midnight,  was a departure from their nu metal sound, and they opted to try experimenting with a classic stadium rock sound. The songs were much slower and anthemic, which worked with the lyrics and message of the album. In A Thousand Suns, Linkin Park seeks to continue their trend of social commentary and self reflection, yet as I stated earlier the music is not working in their favor. With Rage the music reflected De la Rocha's seething social commentary, the rock complemented the lyrical delivery and you could feel the utter contempt the band had for the powers that be. With Linkin Park, while Shinoda and Bennington's message is there, it gets lost amidst the dance beats and electronic synthesizers. I won't get into how much I hate how pop music has infiltrated rock, but the music itself is a distraction, the club beats are extremely mainstream and do nothing to complement the message that the band is trying to send.  In short, the music on this album is all over the place. While it contains a distinctive Linkin Park quality to it, their \\"new\\" style sounds like songs from the Minutes to Midnight and Fort Minor albums remixed and mastered to beats from the Black Eyed Peas and Postal Service. Needless to say, this album is not for everyone; you will either love it or hate it. I recommend previewing or even downloading a leaked version of this album before going to the store to buy it.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|So sings the venerable Robert Plant in Silver Rider, as far as I'm concerned the most amazing song on a totally amazing CD.<br /><br />But it is enough. If fact, it's never been better.<br /><br />But it's not just the voice. Everything about this CD, from the song selection to the musicianship and production is of the highest standard.<br /><br />Silver Rider is haunting, mysterious and menacing. Falling In Love Again is filled with a wistful desire. Central Two-O-Nine manages to be both rollicking and dark all at once.<br /><br />How does he do it?<br /><br />And then there is Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down and Even This Shall Pass Away. Plant doesn't overreach in ending the album with Biblical overtones.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000000OE7|5.0|I have been a big Queen fan since the 70's.  You gotta love Mercury's voice, such a distinct sound.  This album brings him back to life for those of us that will always miss Freddie's voice.  Great cd.
0786956291|5.0|Let me just say: This is It.     This is 4th edition that has been refined, worked over and condensed into a lightweight, easy-playing system that does exactly what is supposed to do. It is an introduction to D&D. Tonight, I helped a friend who is new to D&D to work her way through the solo adventure to create her character. I've played 4th edition before and there was something very liberating about Essentials. Because of the limited number of choices, it actually meant we could get to the gameplay and not spend 6 hours debating what feats to take.      She chose to play a Cleric. There are two Cleric themes, she chose to be a Sun Cleric. The Player's Guide then detailed what powers she had and I was able to simply hand her a small stack of the power cards that are included. Basically, everything about this new red box allows you to make a create, grab some dice and then GO.     While some parts of the character creation felt a little clunky, I still remain pretty happy with this product. I see myself using it to introduce many new players to the game, as well as enjoy quality gaming time with other gamers. Overall, a great purchase.     11/1/10 With more play under my belt, I wanted to add some notes about the red box. I've been running the adventure from the red box for around 7 players. I have a mix of essential and regular characters. What I've found most useful so far is the map, the tokens and the book itself. While WOTC has a historically bad experience in writing modules for 4.0, the adventure in the DM book is beautifully crafted. It really lets me run the game smoothly even though I have little time to prepare for the game since I work two jobs and attend college.      Ultimately, I've found the cards kinda useless but the players might end up using them if I actually organized them. However, I had a cool idea. For each encounter, I've created a ziplock bag with the appropriate monster tokens included. For the encounters that include treasure or various items, I can just put the card in the baggie so I remember to give it to the players. Honestly, I think I'm spoiled by the character builder because handwriting character sheets, or helping someone do that, isn't my strength.     I think the biggest surprise to me was how much I liked the module included. It makes me look forward to the adventure included in the DM kit.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Not being very tech savvy, I ordered these headphones for my son, thinking he could use them with his Xbox 360.  My mistake, but he still gets lots of use out of them while he's on the computer.  He's very happy that they're wireless and the charge lasts for quite a while.  The charger is included.  He especially enjoys how well they work with iTunes.  There's a button on the side of them that opens iTunes and the ability to pause and skip to the next song is a plus.  The surround sound is very good quality, they are comfortable to wear, and they block out outside noises as well.  He also enjoys using them while playing computer games.  Read the other reviews for more technical information.  I wish I could comment on that, but I am clueless about all that stuff.  My teenaged son is very happy with them and has used them every day since we got them.  I can recommend.
B003XU7VY2|5.0|I have heard wonderful things about Mitch Albom's book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", and I have always wanted to read it, so when I picked this one up, I expected something special. The title itself appealed to me, and this is normally when I find myself disappointed with a book.     But not this time. The stories of the two men of faith in this book were wonderful, and made me see that people can come to follow God from almost any place in life. Albom weaves these two men and their stories into some wonderful lessons an faith, dedication and how a love of God can rise up and totally shape a man.....even when it seems the have gone so far astray that there is no coming back.    But this book is more than a story.....it is non-fiction, it is written about REAL people and their lives, and this made it even more special to me. The lessons that come from this book are wonderful, and I found myself thinking and tearing up.     I highly recommend the audiobook as it is read by Albom with emphasis and emotion on the lines that only the author could do.     A wonderful work of non-fiction! I recommend it highly!!!
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Ok, I have to agree with some other people who are shocked by all the negative reviews. I have been a LP since the beginning and unlike most people, I believe that their growth as a band has been great! I absolutely loved \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" and although at first listen this album is wildly different then what you would expect for LP, the more I listen the more I love. Be prepared to hear something you aren't used to from them, but give it a chance, that's all I can say.    This is not the album for you if you want to listen to more of the same thing album after album. My suggestion is maybe you should stick to listening to poppy style rock. Every great band goes through a growth, and I think LP is well on their way to becoming one of the greats.     I love this album and can't get enough of it. Thanks LP for another great album!
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy has surely out done herself with her sophomore album, Teenage Dream. She mixes amazing, strong, independent songs with some fun \\"teenbopper\\" tunes. Katy Perry shows all her colors with witty songs like \\"Peacock\\" and \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F)\\" while keeping her ability to stand for herself with songs like \\"Circle the Drain\\". She is an amazing role model for any girl and this album only proves her capabilities and range in the music industry! I can't wait to see what else she has in store for her fans on tour and any other albums to come in the future!
006145205X|4.0|The book has a few good points, and it does bolster the case for optimism. Because of the interconnectivity of people(amongst other things) ideas do \\"have sex', as the author put it, and progress does accelerate exponentially, and so does solving of many pressing problems(global warming, fossil fuel usage, war, disease, education etc.). Lets hope that \\"ideas having sex\\" will solve some of the worst problems(to my mind anyway) of nuclear wipe-out and creeping socialism, issues which he did not tackle in much depth. Or not to my satisfaction anyway.Maybe they are not real problems in the authors mind. Of nuclear weapons; he states that there are less now than there was earlier, and that is cause for optimism. Maybe. If you are a pessimist, these tow things are still enough of a problem to worry.<br /><br />Decent book, it did make me more optimistic, worth the read.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I can deal with an unsatisfactory ending, but I can't really deal with a pointless ending and broken promises.<br /><br />After season 3, I was getting worried that we'd just see more and more mysteries and we'd never get any answers. Then when they said there would be 6 seasons, I saw a lot of things that gave me hope:<br /><br />\\"From the very beginning, fans and even critics have been saying, 'Are you making it up as you go along?' ' which was 'a legitimate question.'<br />Now, with a still far-away ending in sight, Lindelof says he and executive producer Carlton Cuse have 'specific designs for ending the next two seasons' and promises that with the answer-filled season finale May 23, viewers \\"will begin to get an idea of what that design will be, and it will not be at all what they expect.'\\"<br /><br />\\"Straight from the mouth of Damon Lindelof: 'You won't have to wait until 2010 to get all the answers you really care about.'\\"<br /><br />Then right before season 6 : \\"Matthew Fox says Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse will prove they knew where they were going all along when the show ends in 'an incredibly powerful, very sad and beautiful way. I think is going to be pretty awesome.'\\"<br /><br />So I continued and continued and believed I would get an ending that at least somewhat resolved things. The fact that the ending left so many things hanging, and left so many things that didn't make sense--I just can't see myself buying the series! And really, it's not because I didn't enjoy the characters. The worst lie the creators/writers told us at the end is that the show was about the characters and not the mysteries. The characters I invested in are worthless because so much of the series was worthless according to the ending! I feel like I've wasted my time investing emotion in their struggles because so many of their struggles are meaningless. And that might be ok if the story was about meaninglessness--but the story told us it was about meaning!<br /><br />The struggles in season 6? Half of them are meaningless because they were dead. Whoops, spoiler alert. Their struggles with Walt? Meaningless because they're left hanging. Their issues with Jacks dad. Meaningless because it wasn't him. Lock? Meaningless because it wasn't really him later on. The characters we saw after they died? Who knows what that meant or if they were even the characters. Jacob's actions and everyone on the island's interactions with him? Well pretty meaningless because they were just whatever Jacob wanted to do.<br /><br />Then there are the mysteries that are solved that still don't make sense in comparison to earlier seasons. If you watch season one again, will the smoke monster make any sense now that you know what it was? Do Loch's actions mean anything now that you know how he ends up? The numbers? It just all becomes meaningless because it had no meaning. How can I even reinvest in the characters if I know so much of it is meaningless? Sayid likes this girl, but he really loves that girl, but he truly loved this girl?<br /><br />Then there's just the ending. What were they smoking? When did anyone invest in these characters to find out what happened to them after they died?<br /><br />They said it was all about the characters. But to really care about characters they have to have consistency and meaningfulness. Without that, Lost really lives up to it's name! I can deal with some mysteries left unsolved, but too many of the ones left open make the characters worthless.aningless because they were dead. Whoops, spoiler alert. Their struggles with Walt?

014241543X|4.0|The intitial blurb I read about this book gave no real indication what it was about, not like the one above.  But, even with this new information, I don't think you can be fully prepared for what this book entails.  I wasn't sure I was going to like it at first.  I'm not sure if it was the time that I read it (not far from were I live, an entire family was killed in a head-on collision a couple days before I read this) or if I was having a hard time with the story format.  It skips back and forth between the present and the past and the writing is different than what I normally read.<br /><br />In the present, Mia watches her body struggle to stay alive.  She has to deal with learning the outcome of the rest of her immediate family.  Plus, she has to watch her grandparents, aunts and uncles, her best friend, and her boyfriend come into to her hospital room.  They're each willing her to live or in some cases telling her it's ok to let go.  It's very heartbreaking, but wonderful at the same time.<br /><br />The flashbacks to the past all detail the connections she has with these people.  It shows how wonderful her family is.  Which makes it understandable why it would be hard for her to live without them.  But, it also shows how much those who are still alive care for her.  So she must make the ultimate decision, should she stay or should she go.  It's one she discovers, only she can make.<br /><br />In the end, I was completely moved by this story.  I cried, I laughed, and I fell in love with the characters and there story.  I was excited to learn days after reading it that the author has written a sequel.  From the sound of it, it's going to be just as heartbreakingly beautiful as this one
0618918248|5.0|EDITED: It was two years ago when I started my disbelief in Religion and an Almighty Deity. I have not read the book yet during those past two years.  Now I've read the book, this year, 2010.  All the ideas, Philosophical arguments, and Scientific reasoning that I have obtained over the passing of time was a big jigsaw puzzle that, although I have all the pieces complete, are scattered all around in a mess. This book, metaphorically, is like a guide that puts numbers in each pieces of that jigsaw so I can easily put it together into one big picture --an arranged, and solved puzzle.  I enjoyed reading this along with the Bible and the Qur'an.<br /><br />So to talk in a straightforward sense, this book is a book that will be enjoyed by Atheists who seeks a solidified formation of their ideas and a \\"cheat-sheet\\" for their debates, but I'd highly recommend this book to those religious -but skeptically thinking of the existence of a god, to further pursue knowledge with truth and logical reasoning.

0374158460|5.0|When people ask me what my favorite book is, I often say \\"The Corrections\\" by Jonathan Franzen. But since it has been so many years since I have read the book, I can hardly even remember the story or why I love it so much. Reading \\"Freedom\\", reminded me of Franzen's impeccable story-telling, character development and the creativity of writing that made me love The Corrections so much. This book had me completely engrossed from the first 60 pages - and the more I read, the more sucked in I got. I could hardly sleep, my thoughts revolved around Franzen's characters their stories, their lives, their problems to the point where I almost forgot where I was, what was going on in my life and where I had to be. Why? Because Jonathan Franzen's characters ARE me. They are everyone. There were so many relatable moments, so many nuances of human interaction that are seldom described, seldom discussed in everyday life- I found myself or the people close to me in every character, in every location, in every struggle.     This novel is an epic story about relationships, and the twists and turns that life takes you - the dramatic changes that occur over a lifetime within ourselves, our world, and our relationships to those around us. The book covers the power of forgiveness, the overwhelming pull of desire, and the FREEDOM to be who we are without apology. I have never read 560+ pages so quickly in my life - I almost wished I would have slowed down in order to savor the story for longer.

B003XL6EKS|3.0|I'm not a die-hard Killers fan or collector but their last release, Day and Age, caught my attention and now I would consider it to be in my top 10 of all time. Of course I realize Brandon Flowers is only one fourth of that group and I shouldn't hold this release up to the standards of any previous Killers album, but since he literally is the voice that keeps them together I was expecting at least some familiarity on his new solo release, Flamingo, while at the same time trying to keep an open mind to the changes and progressions that would naturally arise with his wider range of artistic freedom. I was ready for anything and really looking forward to this.<br /><br />But after several listens, I just cannot get into this record at all. It is such a radical departure from anything I would have expected from Mr. Flowers, not to mention the usually upbeat Stuart Price and the other producers listed, whom I generally do like. I'm not going to use the word \\"bad\\" here because it most certainly is not. In fact lyrically it's very thoughtful and provocative and he really does come off as a wonderful poet in his own right with a knack for Springsteen-esque \\"story songs.\\" However, the music is so dull and minimal that it kind of negates the point of even trying to make a full-length song out of it at all, as opposed to maybe just a spoken word piece. There are no hooks or catchy melodies present and several tracks have a non-structural, folksy air about them that might make one wonder if he's making this up as he goes along. Nothing pops out at you as being especially noteworthy and it sounds unfinished, hence no good guesses about possible future, radio-friendly singles. Luckily I purchased the 14-track deluxe edition because the four bonus songs are actually quite good and even a little catchy (I dare you not to tap your toes to \\"Clock Was Ticking\\") but by track 11, it's too little, too late. I can only imagine the disappointment I would have felt had I got the standard 10-track edition.<br /><br />In closing, it's very evident Flowers is a creative soul, but he sounds oddly restrained and Flamingo comes off as just a preliminary sketch of the album he REALLY wanted to make. I tried my best to abandon all expectations and was still underwhelmed, so I cannot in good conscience recommend this to major Killers fans. Even those with a casual interest may find it uneven. Like I said, I'm not trying to compare the old with the new. I just think in and of itself it's a bit bland, and dare I say it, boring.dition.

0439023513|2.0|Big Disappointment!!!  I was excited for this book.  Loved the first two.  Totally disappointed with this book about 3/4 of the way through.  How depressing and violent.

B003V5PPZG|4.0|First things first, I'm glad I listened to this album BEFORE reading the reviews its received from some of the band's more dedicated fan base. As nearly every other reviewer (along with the band themselves, see the album notes above) has said in defense of this album, this album is NOTHING like ANYTHING this band has put out before. And that's exactly why you should not hesitate to give it a spin. It's mountains above anything they've ever been a part of prior to this record.<br /><br />True, gone are the catchy hooks that gave them so much radio success over the last eight years or so. However, with them go the gimmicks, the cheesiness, and the apparently innate need to please the tens of millions of fans who have followed them since their inception. This time, as the band readily admits, it was \\"&%!* the fans and make the record WE want to make.\\" I don't think I'll be the first to thank them for it.<br /><br />Listening to the first two tracks will clue you in to how the rest of the record is going to play out. Indeed, one has to wonder if the band didn't fire their guitar player and replace the drummer with a machine after the last touring cycle. They certainly won't be needed here. Samples and keyboards are aplenty, and chords are scarce. The song \\"Robot Boy\\" is a prime example, and those who've been keen to the scene for the last ten years or so should draw comparisons to the Dandy Warhols' \\"Godless\\" or \\"Mohammed\\", both epic songs that you should check out if you like this kinda thing. A love of mixing electronica with their proven pop sensibilities has proven taken hold of Linkin Park, and with any luck, there will be enough fans to support it to see what else they can come up with in the future. Or would you rather have them singing about how they're about to BREAK again? No one wants to hear thirty-somethings whining about how frustrated and angry they are, that's why Korn is such a joke nowadays. Good for these boys learning that lesson early on.<br /><br />If you'd prefer they stick to their \\"roots\\", you can always go with some of these new bands like Rev Theory or whatever that still sing about doing coke and hanging out with strippers. Some things will NEVER change.stick to their \\"roots\\", you can always go with some of these new bands like Rev Theory or whatever that still sing about doing coke and hanging out with strippers.

I am looking forward to my next workout in the AM before work.  I plan to try all of JM's workouts on Demand for free, while they are available before I purchase them.      Several people have commented about the workouts being too hard on the knees, if you listen to Jillian and do the moves correctly you won't have a problem..the correct form is the key, just listen to Jillians instruction on the correct form when doing workouts that may injure you if done incorrectly.  I would strongly recommend this workout to anyone who wants to get into shape, maintain or lose weight.    I hate over the top, chatty, hyper instructors, Jillian is the complete opposite. She's all about the workout and correct form, another reason I love her workouts.  (The negative comments about the backround music), I'm more focused on Jillian, the workout and my form, therefore the music is fine.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Some themes are so scarcely realized that when the audience even attempts to put it all together they wind up with a massive headache.  That is kind of what `Swordfish' feels like.  This is a film that has a neat idea, but that idea is just kind of thrown into a film with no real sense of direction and it thus fall disastrously apart.<br /><br />Kind of like John Travolta's career (not to mention his hair).<br /><br />The plot is kind of a mess and really doesn't deserve your attention.  It makes very little sense and continually digs its own holes.  By the time the films conclusion FINALLY rolls around you'll be scratching your head more and aching to press down the `off' switch on your remote.<br /><br />Yes, Halle goes topless.  I know that it why you wanted to see this movie in the first place.  To be completely honest, it's not really worth it.  I mean, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.  The scene where she's uncovered as a (SPOILER: undercover agent) is far sexier.<br /><br />Count on Travolta to muck it all up with his ridiculous acting (where is early 90's Travolta, you know, when he had slivers of talent?).<br /><br />There are some visually stunning sequences, but this is definitely a film that overdoes the visuals to mask its lack of depth.  Here is where my biggest issue comes into play.  A lot of people seem to be blinded by the fact that this film pretends to be smart.  Yes, it has an original concept that it flaunts unapologetically, but it also fails to develop that concept, and that is unforgivable.  Like I said, it just tosses the `concept' in there for a focal point but then covers it over with senselessness.<br /><br />Believe me, you will have NO IDEA what this movie is about by the time it all unfolds.<br /><br />Hollywood clich&eacute;s also seem to muddle the waters here.  It's a shame when someone can't just develop their ideas properly.  In the right hands, with the right cast (Jackman has the talent, but he isn't used properly here...and Don Cheadle deserved a meatier role) and the right focus, this could have been an intriguing and stimulating film.<br /><br />Instead, this is just a mess.ave been an intriguing and stimulating film.

B002ZG98UA|2.0|\\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" proves once again that a good story is hard to come by. Good storytelling is even harder. By saying \\"good,\\" I only mean \\"adequate\\" and \\"coherent.\\" Nothing more. I'm only saying just because a film is based on video game doesn't mean it should be written poorly and directed badly.     So Milla Jovovich's Alice has come back. The film is set first in Tokyo, and then in USA. With Claire (Ali Larter) who has lost her memories, Alice looks for \\"Arcadia,\\" a haven free of undeads. In a former prison building in the zombie-ravaged city of LA, Alice and Clair are greeted by survivors including Luther (Boris Kodjoe) and Chris (Wentworth Miller). Some of the major characters of the series will return (albeit briefly), so do not miss the end credit.     For director Paul W.S. Anderson, all that matters is actions. And the actions of are \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" not particularly great. The opening Shibuya underground battle sequence shows no sign of creativity. It seems he is so intent on shooting scenes using 3-D camera that he forgets everything he is doing has been done before. Things get better as the film goes on, but too late, the film is almost over.     Alice has become such a strong fighter, capable of using any kinds of weapons, that she can apparently survive anything, even a plane crash (though the film never explains how). Whatever happens to her, we no longer care. Her lengthy battles against the big bad corporation Umbrella's Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who looks like Agent Smith (or Terminator), goes on and on ... probably to another sequel.    Those who have seen the film in 3D may find it interesting to watch objects flying at the camera. I don't dislike it, but I prefer more straightforward but effective ways to entertain, like storytelling and characters.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Wow!  This DVD set is nothing short of spectacular.  The DVD set contains all 22 episodes of Season 1 on seven discs.  The show speaks for itself - it's positively delightful.  Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I turn on an episode of Glee.  The music makes me smile, and there's almost always at least three lines that make me laugh incredibly hard.  The cast, especially Matthew Morrison, Lea Michele, and Cory Monteith, are phenomenally talented, and rejuvenate old classics with brand-new energy and vigor.  Plus the guest stars are spectacular - Neil Patrick Harris, Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth, and the list goes on!<br /><br />The DVD set itself is also great.  The menus are easy to navigate, and even include a short synopsis of each episode when you click on that episode.  I haven't made it through all of the special features yet, but there are lots of them, including: a Glee \\"jukebox\\" (basically a selection of songs from different episodes to listen to), a Glee sing-a-long with four songs, a comprehensive dance instructional, a short feature on the costumes, and more!<br /><br />I recommend both this set and the show.  I know many people bought Volume 1 when it first came out, which contains only the first 13 episodes, but this is a great alternative to buying both volumes separately.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is one of my favorite books of all time. I have recently become interested in the holocaust and read several fiction books on the subject. Sarah's Key absolutely touched my heart. Not only is it a story about the holocaust but a story about how one little girl who lost her family during this time completely changed a woman's life. The little girl Sarah and Julia's lives intertwine even though they never knew each other after Julia discovers the horrifying story of Sarah and her family and also the connection that Julia's family has with Sarah. This book is best read slowly. Do not speed through it. Savor every page.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|One of the best films I have seen in a LONG TIME.\\"Transamerica\\" is a funny,serious,weird movie.Its also a road adventure piece .This is not a movie for kids.It has male prostitution,drugs and nudity,but it all makes sense for the film to work.Felicity Huffman deserves all the awards for the movie and should have won the Oscar.She really looks like  a transgender.I really enjoyed this movie.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|In response to Herr Spielmann (nice Mahlerian allusion):<br /><br />If one compares it to Furtwangler's RAI Ring, one sees a tremendous difference between a \\"studio version\\" (such as the Ring) and a true enactment of the opera, as is seen in this performance.  You get a far greater dramatic involvement on the part of the singers here - particularly by Siepi and Edelmann - than one hears in Patzak's Mime in the Ring (for example).  In fact, it was not apparent to me that this WASN'T in front of an audience.<br /><br />Siepi's Don has to be the most moving and multifacted approach to the Don that I have heard.  His acting is incredible, his voice unbelievably beautiful, and his presence imposing.  For me, it will be a long time - if ever - before I can think of the Don without thinking of him.  He is able to use small gestures, facial expressions,  body language, and tonal inflection to communicate more than I have ever seen before in this role.  In particular, unlike many one-dimensional, macho Don's that I have seen, he vividly projects a powerful mixture of terror, defiance, and being overwhelmed in the final scene with the Commendatore.  One feels almost sorry for him when he is dragged down to hell.  Edelmann, who I have only known through Wagner roles, is perfect for Leporello.  He conveys Leporello's humanity and humor to a T.  Walter Berry, caught very early in his career, showed the comedic genius - to say nothing of the vocal presence - that he brought to so many roles later in his career.  While Anton Dermota is some what dry and a bit more \\"spinto\\" than I like (let's face it, I've been spoiled by Fritz Wunderlich's excerpts!), he does a splendid job as Don Ottavio.  The women are equally wonderful!  Elizabeth Grummer brings a Wagnerian (although not Valkyrie) strength to the role of Donna Anna that is far more appropriate that Bohm's Birgit Nilsson.  She truly conveys that powerful sense of anger and rage - as well as the internal ambivalence - that DonnaAnna feels towards the Don.  Lisa Della Casa sings Donna Elvira with a wonderful sensitivity and beauty and Erna Berger is perfect as the young and naive Zerlina.<br /><br />While all of this is quite true, it doesn't address the true star of this show: Wilhelm Furtwangler.  This is a Mozart that is so dramatically alive, so beautifully played, that contains such rich orchestral detail and sense of musical line throughout the the opera that it truly sets the gold standard for performances of this opera.<br /><br />I have to say that the fact that one doesn't have applause or curtain calls not only seems like an extremely minor cavil and the lack thereof helps to maintain dramatic continuity by avoiding breaking the dramatic continuity of the performance of (the well deserved) \\"bravos\\" that would have brought the performance to a halt.<br /><br />For me, this DVD IS Don Giovanni with the finest possible cast and the greatest possible conductor AND it is staged!!  Who could ask for anything more!!!!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I'm sure others will write about the actual film itself, and so I will allow others to summarize it and talk about what they think of the movie, except to say that I feel this is the best movie that Hitchcock did, which is saying a lot!<br /><br />I'll focus more on the picture quality of the Blu-ray for those trying to decide whether or not it is worth the upgrade from the DVD. The answer is YES. The restoration done for this film reportedly cost in excess of 1 million dollars, and it shows. The picture is flawless, and rivals even newer movies. I've seen movies released this year that don't have a gorgeous transfer like this. You'll probably have to turn your volume up a little higher than normal to find the right volume, but the sound is also excellent.<br /><br />North by Northwest is a cinematic masterpiece, and I'm thrilled to see it get the treatment it deserves on Blu-Ray. A gorgeous transfer that is well worth the upgrade from DVD. No collection should be without this movie!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I just happened to run across this show while surfing the channels and that's all it took! This show will have you laughing, crying, and just in shock at times! The cast was cleverly designed~ they all fit so well together to make this my ultimate favorite show yet!
0765356139|3.0|I recently read and enjoyed Mistborn.  It was long, but I didn't feel like it was bloated, and I remained interested throughout.  The Well of Ascention was much longer and had much less content.  Frankly, it should have been cut in half lenghtwise.  Nothing of importance would have been lost, since there are a ridiculous number of subplots which end up having absolutely no impact on the plot at all.  It's especially painful because the plot that's strangled by all the dead weight actually could have been very interesting.  Instead, because of the way it was presented it lost a lot of its impact.
0545123283|4.0|I have to admit, I was a bit leery of reading Linger.  I hadn't been too impressed by Shiver, as it didn't feel very original nor seemed to have depth.  Linger was thankfully better, and I feel the improvement was in part to the multiple points of view throught different characters,as well as introducing some new elements of mystery to the reasons behind the were-wolves.  My only complaint however, is the degree the lousy parennts-misunderstood teenager card is played.  There isn't one set of decent parents in the whole book that seems to care about their children.  That said, I thought it was better than Shiver, but I probably won't go out and buy it to own myself.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|I've been listening to this non stop for the last two days and on the whole I like it.    I must admit I didn't get Raising Sand because much as I like Allison and Robert separately, I just think her voice is too sweet, and based on the cuts from the recording I did hear I'm sticking with that. I wanted too, I really did, but I just couldn't do it.    Anyway, when NPR debuted this and I listened to it and I liked it alot so when it went on sale I downloaded it from here.    Anyway, the songs are all very atmospheric with lots of space - lots of echoy guitars, gritty bass (or barely there bass, depending on the song), and lots of Plant's vocals, which is a good thing - the man can STILL sing. There's also some very traditional songs like \\"Falling In Love Again\\" - while it doesn't sound like a song from the 50s (I dunno why, to me it doesn't) it's not sappy or over done, it's just good. (for some reason this song has the most Zepplinesque feel to it to me, I guess it's the guitarwork).    Buddy Miller's guitar playing on this compliments and weaves in and out of the vocals - it's a wonderful thing to hear :). Even on something like \\"even this shall pass away\\" which is very spare and modern the song just fits right in there with his voice.    My favorite songs are probably Angel Dance, House of Cards (love Buddy's Richard Thompsonesque guitar riffs on this one), You Can't Buy my Love (for the guitar and bass work partiularly on this one - great stuff! makes me want to get my air bass out and dance around the house), and Monkey, but they're all very good.    And I LOVE Patty Griffin's vocals on this - she's perfect - her voice is there where it needs to be, not to sweet but not to gritty - just what it needs to be, and it really adds to the sound.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|From \\"Live At The Isle Of Wight\\" to \\"Songs From The Road\\", the journey of Leonard Cohen has been an enviable life filled with the impressions the ordinary man can only hope to express. I'm overwhelmed by his various interpretions of the songs he created out of the breath of his life. Like a fine wine, he ages in the bottle of his existance and his performances exhibits an exceptance of his mortaity. I can only hope for more from this master of the words, poems and songs of life, and I shall mourn when his words and songs come forth nomore. Truly, one of the best of the best, a master of interpreting the human condition. Thank you Leonard, you enhanced my life.
B003V5PPZG|2.0|Rick Rubin ruined Linkin Park.  Thanks, Rick.  Minutes to Midnight was a diappointment, and this is the nail in the coffin.  Also, I liked their misery-wallowing but catchy songs just fine without the need for the politics of MTM the prominent F-bombing.  sheesh.
0399215921|3.0|The book is amazing, of course. Eric Carle is a great author. However, this book is ridiculously small. It barely fits in your hand. I was hoping for a book that I could easily flip through with my nephew, but it's too small. Disappointing!

B0029XXT4K|3.0|Ed Friedland is a great teacher. I have several print books that he wrote. They came with CDs of the audio tracks referenced in the book. These tracks are a very important part of the book.<br /><br />I was very disappointed to find that the CD tracks were not a part of the Kindle version. To buy this book like this is like buying a NYT-top selling hardback and discovering that you were given the abridged version as you walked out of the store. i have looked around the Kindle site and have not found any link to download this integral part of the book.<br /><br />I also bought \\"R&B Bass Masters\\", and it is the same--no audio tracks, and these tracks are clearly referenced in both Kindle books with numbered CD icons. If these books were complete, I would probably give them 5 stars, but I feel that without these tracks, they maybe are not even worth the 3 stars that I gave.
0439023513|2.0|While the first book was a thoroughly entertaining, gripping and original story - the third book left me very disappointed.   The author has used this third book to put forth her own personal agenda on shocking the reader on the horrors of the human condition.   If you feel the human race is doomed due to our own violence and want a brutal way to get to that message; then this book is for you.   I just disagree with the authors decision to take an original story and twist the end so it benefits her agenda.  I would have rather re-read the first book than read the third.  (or second)    Yes, in the third book you get to find out what happens to everyone, but its sad, depressing and in my opinion inaccurate on the human condition.   If you need closure for the series, don't expect much.   Lastly, the gore and brutality is so rampant - I really wouldn't feel comfortable with many reading this book, much less kids under the age of 16 (or older!).
B003UYUQZW|2.0|Imagine someone had Alladin in one nostril and Raiders of the Lost Arc in the other.  OK, now imagine they sneeze really, really hard--> out pops Prince of Persia.  While the special effects are great the story is predictable and feels like you've seen it before.  EXample:  Alldin and the future Prince of Persia are both \\"diamonds in the rough (i.e. orphan street rats)\\"   Alladin steels an apple in the market place; Prince of Persia pays for it in the market place.  A pompous lord is about to run over a poor peasant then hit him then Alladin/Prince of Persia does the noble thing and rescues him.  The chase seen through the market place for both is very similar (minus abu the monkey).  The Princess of the town the Persians attack is exactly like Jasmine in Alladin (self-assured, not going to take crap or marry the \\"typical\\" prince.  The bulk of the story has the Princess and Prince of Persia stealing the \\"sacred dagger\\" back and forth from each other while betraying the other one constantly.  This part is pretty boring and predictable (would you believe they find themselves falling in love through all the betrayals?  Who could have guessed that?  I like all the actors and actresses but the characters are flat and predictable.  A lot of the bad guys and the ending with the giant hour glass of time reminds me of Raiders of the Lost arc.  Now if you are wondering if there is a magic carpet the answer is no!  So that is a difference but not really because they make up for it by having the Prince of Persia have spiderman like skill so he doesn't need the carpet guy.  This dude can absolutely fly and walk up walls and hold on with one hand to a slippery step when tons of sand is dumping on top of him.  Pretty cool except he doesn't have the red and blue suit.  Overall, worth watching once but you would never need to see it again.   Hope that helps:)

B001TH8UUA|5.0|Product is definitely worth the purchase.  It performs exactly as advertised, and it is priced substantionally lower than competitors. I've only used the cable once, but it seems to be made of decent quality.  It also arrived on-time, and the packaging is perfect; very sturdy to survive shipping, yet easy to open.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I get a kick out of the clowns at the electronics stores who have been trained to sell the so called high end video cables.  I feel sorry for all of the folks who have gotten sucked into the hype and been relieved of their hard earned income.  What a joke.  An HDMI cable transfers a set of high speed digital on/off signals.  Very basic concept and it doesn't require something built for NASA.  As long as it is built to a minimum standard the signal that it transmits is absolutely the same as the more expensive cable, basically it works or it doesn't. If someone tries to convince you that there is a difference in real viewing performance I would be very skeptical.  It would be like the rich guy trying to tell you that the light from his lamps is of a better quality because he uses gold plated light switches.  Trust me the light bulb doesn't care and neither does your TV.    These cables serve to give you a quality product at a price that is commensurate with what is a mature and very commonly used technology.
0840378165|5.0|ISBN 0840378165 - The book doesn't say where it was published or the target age group. I really like childrens' books with gimmicks and even though Where's Waldo and I Spy have done the hidden object thing nearly to death, Each Peach Pear Plum manages to not bore me at all.<br /><br />Each two-page spread features one \\"hidden object\\" - actually a character or set of characters from childrens' literature - and the rhyming text that tells you who that character is. The character from the first page is pointed out on the second page, with a new character to find, and so on. All of the books' characters make an appearance on the final page.<br /><br />There are two reasons that this book really works for me. One is that it's an excellent door to other books, the books that tell the stories of all the characters in this book. Anything that leads to more reading is a good thing. Then there's the simplicity of the seek and find aspect. No one is terribly well hidden, making the search easy for young children and keeping them from being discouraged. The illustrations are cute and cartoon-y.<br /><br />I have only one complaint. I can't figure out why the East Coast bad grammar of \\"Mother Hubbard down the cellar\\" got into this book. Down the cellar? I have a friend who goes \\"up the mall\\" and I have yet to get her to explain if she does it with suction cup shoes or a Spiderman-like web, but either way... it's bad grammar.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
B003L0VJF6|5.0|Julia Fischer is celebrated as a brilliant violinist, mature way beyond her age, in command of a wide range of musical styles and a shining presence on concert stages around the globe. At the same time, she has developed a virtuoso command of the piano since her childhood. This DVD, recorded live on 1 January 2008, documents \\"a musical first\\": her performance of the Saint-Saëns Third Violin Concerto and, on the same occasion, her d&eacute;but as a concert pianist with Grieg's A minor concerto. The venue is Frankfurt's Alte Oper, and Fischer, is accompanied by the Junge Deutsche Philharmonie conducted by Matthias Pintscher. I had not heard this orchestra before, nor was I familiar with Pintscher, but I find their contribution very fine. Fischer's interpretation of the Saint-Saëns is perfect in every respect: technically stunning, sensitive without being sentimental and fully in tune with the French romantic idiom. Her performance of the Grieg - not a particularly \\"deep\\" piece, but full of atmosphere, color, irresistible lyricism and grandiose rhetoric - can stand with the best. She may not have the final ounce of steel-fingered strength as some of her fellow pianists, and she may not (yet) be able to play the piano blindfolded. But her technique is amazing, and so is her illumination of the old warhorse score which provides some fresh insights, especially in the second and final movements. In addition to this unique and memorable concert, the disk has a substantial bonus feature: an informal interview with Julia Fischer that shows her as an eminently likable young woman, unpretentious but highly articulate and devoted to her art. This is a disk to behold, worth every penny.<br />P.S. Why don't we get more bonus features like this (artist interviews, rehearsal clips etc.) on DVDs? The superior length of the DVD (vs. CD) makes it the perfect medium for extras. Is anyone at Arthaus, DG, EuroArts, id&eacute;aleaudience, Philips et al. out there listening and reading this??

Miles Davis's trumpet playing is flawless and fits the atmosphere and rythym of the other musicians like 'it was made in heaven' as the drummer was quoted to say. John Coltrane of course is amazing as well. I've listened to 'Kind of Blue' dozens of times since buying it and it never gets old. Memorized most of it and somehow it never stops sounding fresh and so relaxing. Definately the greatest jazz album I've ever bought. Somehow Miles captured so much emotion and feeling in such a tiny space of time and he does it like it's the easiest thing in the world.

0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is the funniest book I have ever picked up. Joseph Heller has to be one of the greatest wits in literature history. The story of Yossarian the pilot who simply wants to live works on so many different levels. In the end the book transcends simply being comedy, it uses humor to pack a helluva moral punch that absolutely reduces the blindness of war, the slavish devotion to government to total ruin. By the end of the book the illogical nature of war is so clear that it's a wonder the UN hasn't declared war illegal and a crime. The dialogue is incredibly clever and the characters so unique and colorful. On of my favorite parts is the scene where General Dreedle at first wants the chaplain to hang out in the bar (\\"So that he can sympathize with the men and gain their trust. How else are they going to believe in God?\\") but in the next breath says, \\"That's a fine thing, a man of God hanging out with a bunch of drunks and losers.\\" And ends up threatening to have the chaplain taken outside and shot. Most of the humor fallows this same pattern, proving over and over again the illogical, contradictory, and insane nature of the military and of war. Or how about Milo and the syndacite? Milo plays both sides of every conflict and ends of funding an enemy bombing of his own batallion...There are better reviews on here and I could go on and on but this book literally blew me over with its powerful message and savagely satirical humor.
0439023513|2.0|At the end of a highly-acclaimed book series, the reader should feel a sense of closure. They can feel elated and happy or miserable and about to cry, but at the very least they should feel as if the series ended in a way that did justice to the characters and the world that was created. However, at the end of the Hunger Games trilogy, I just felt angry. I felt like I just had been part of a sadistic game where I poured such emotional attachment onto the characters and got very little in return.  Let me explain why I feel this way. I devoured the first book in a day and couldn't sit still until I had bought and finished the trilogy. I loved the characters and also the parallels with our reality-show-watching, image-obsessed society. I started out loving \\"Mockingjay\\" as well, but as the novel wore on, I felt more and more like I was in someone's sadistic nightmare. The events of the book just become unrelentingly awful. Every single chapter, Collins finds a new way to torture her characters both physically and emotionally. I mean that literally; there is a reference to torture in every single chapter. Characters are hunted down by horrific muttations that destroy them in the most psychologically damaging way possible. Inevitably, I became numb to it; by the time that we get to the point where children are being used as human shields, I'm not even shocked, just angry at the author for being so manipulative.   I read on, expecting that the ending would justify the many, many horrific deaths in this novel. All of this would have been worth it IF the ending was satisfying. However, the ending was extremely disappointing, because in the end, it had nothing to do with Katniss's growth as a character. I cannot go into more detail without spoilers, but in the end I felt as if all the emotional investment I had in this series and these characters was pointless. In other words, I was played.   I have given this book two stars, not one, because it DID make me think deeply aboutmy own world and its values, and though the ending made me very angry, any book that can make me feel so deeply upset must be good. The trilogy as a whole deserves accolades. Still, I cannot help but feel that this was NOT the ending that the series or its devoted readers deserved.
B000001ELL|4.0|1979 was a rocky year for KISS.  Drummer Peter Criss was unraveling.  He no longer enjoyed his place in the band and due to this his performance began to suffer.  Ace Frehley was discouraged by the band's direction but was riding high off of the success of his solo project.  Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley seemed intent on making an album that fit the current music scene and it appeared as if no one could stop them.<br /><br />No matter who's side you take in the seemingly unending battle between the Criss/Frehley and Simmons/Stanley camps, you have to admit that Dynasty turned out to be a pretty good album.  Often mistakenly referred to as the \\"disco\\" album (primarily by people who are only familiar with I Was Made For Lovin' You), Dynasty has proven to age with grace, slowly becoming more accepted by KISS fans and rock fans in general.<br /><br />Yes, disco does make an appearance on this album via I Was Made For Lovin' You, Sure Know Something, and Dirty Livin', but the bulk of the album consists of strong pop rock and genuine hard rock.<br /><br />Peter Criss only performs on one song on the album, the aforementioned Dirty Livin'.  He co-wrote it with Vincent Poncia and Stan Penridge.  He does an excellent job on the tune.  The rest of the album's drumming duties are handled by Anton Fig, most notable for being a part of Paul Shaffer's CBS Orchestra on The Late Show With David Letterman.  He does a wonderful job and, to be honest, blends into the band seamlessly.<br /><br />Gene Simmons penned X-Ray Eyes and co-wrote Charisma with Howard Marks.  These are also the only songs that feature his vocals.  These two songs contain hints of Simmons' experimental solo sound as well as traditional KISS rock n' roll.  Charisma is one of the best tunes on the album in my opinion.<br /><br />Ace Frehley rises to prominence on this record, writing and performing vocals on Hard Times and Save Your Love, as well as doing a brilliant cover of the Rolling Stones' 2,000 Man.  All of his songs are straight-ahead rock n' roll and most closely mirror older KISS material.  Perhaps he was feeding off of the popularity of his solo project, but he definitely had something going on this album.  It features some of his best vocal and guitar work in the band's catalogue.<br /><br />Paul Stanley wrote or co-wrote and performs lead vocals on three of the album's tunes including the hit I Was Made For Lovin' You, Sure Know Something, and Magic Touch.  In my opinion, Sure Know Something is quite possibly the best song on the album.  To me, it best represents the band's state of transition, featuring hints of disco, pop rock, hard rock and even a bit of hair metal blended into one song.<br /><br />In all, this album is a mixture of where the band had been (Frehley and Simmons' contributions), where it was headed (Stanley's tunes), and who was ready to call it quits (Criss' Dirty Livin').  Somehow Dynasty manages to work with all of these forces pulling at each other and ends up a very, very good album.  Kudos to producer Vincent Poncia for figuring out a way to make a very solid album.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys great rock n' roll, pop rock, and even a tad bit of disco.roll and most closely mirror older KISS material.

0307463745|5.0|This book is excellent for those of us who are tired of the traditional 9-5 with everything done a very specific way. The authors cover everything from things you know already (like unproductive meetings) to things you never thought about, but wish you had (how tired the word entrepreneur is). I HIGHLY recommend this read for anyone balancing a 9-5 and a business or running a small startup - it allows you to think creatively about working efficiently and expanding only when you need to so that your business can grow the way it should - slowly and strategically!
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I won't write a long, drawn out review of this album, as I don't consider myself a music critic.  What I am, however, is a lover of music.  This cd is fantastic!  From the moment I popped it into my player, the music took hold of me.  The songs are very folksy and roots oriented.  Robert's voice is in great form as well.  I am someone who would like to see a Zep reunion as much as the next person, but I'm also content to listen to the fabulous music Robert Plant continues to make as a solo artist.

B0034G4OVS|3.0|Good B movie, with some great acting and some pretty good emotional factors. I'm not much of a skier myself but you do have to wonder how much attention people would get if they did \\"happen\\" to get stuck on one, which is the reason this movie isn't very realistic. I live in WV and never once has there ever been a story of someone getting stuck on a ski lift, pretty much in the history of the state. Even at the places we have here Snowshoe and Wisp, they always check and double or triple check and do up keep all year around to maintain everything and make sure no one is or would be stranded. All that aside the idea is clever, and its pleasant to watch. The falling, frost bite, climbing on the sharp cables are all very accurate and plausible, so you could really see yourself in the situation of doing what the kids do to try and survive. And the level of panic and emotion is set very well within the circumstances, so thumbs up for that. The one thing i hated about this movie is the wolves. Rarely do they hang around were people thrive, let alone a ski resort, or if they did they are very afraid of humans and would run at the site of you. Basically like a shark to blood they have the wolves come out after a minute or so when the first person is on the ground, due to the scent of blood. No. Not to give to much away but i think maybe they should have thought of something a little better than getting eaten by wolves, but it does add to the horror. So its not a bad movie, and not a great one, its just there. The music is very emotional for a survival picture and you can relate to how the final person is feeling when staring death in the face. And though its not the ending i wanted or expected its better than i thought.    Next time leave out the wolves who wouldnt come near you, especially to rip you apart and eat your entrails. lol

1878424505|4.0|In The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz outlines and explains four agreements or strategies for living a more centered, peaceful life.  The agreements seem simple and practical leaving the reader wondering why they never thought of them before or nodding in agreement.  There are moments though when they seem a bit unrealistic for real life.  Ruiz provides examples that simplify the agreemetns and make them plausible.  There is a bit of the \\"that sounds nice, but...\\" feeling that accompanies reading parts of The Four Agreements.  Ruiz explains a different way of looking at each individual's life and dealing with each other than most people will recognize.  At its core, The Four Agreements is about treating one's self and those around one better.  Ruiz has created a well-written, intriguing, easy to understand examination of the facets of Toltec Wisdom that the reader will want to keep on hand for reference when life feels chaotic or just painful.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|\\"This aint like their old stuff!\\"<br /><br />No crap, man!  Most true artists evolve and change over time. It's called \\"growing up!\\" Personally, I've changed quite a bit in ten years.  I've grown up and my worldview is completely different than it was in 1999.<br /><br />If you like the old sound, great, listen to their old CD's!  This album doesn't nullify their previous works.  In my opinion, \\"A Thousand Suns\\" is a very good effort.
0143118420|2.0|I received this book as a gift and so forced myself to continue reading it long after the over-hyped light started flashing. Not only was this book boring but I think the most outstanding issue was this woman's total self absorption. That was mind numbing!
0385504225|3.0|As a scientist, I'm not a big fan of fiction. I decided to purchase and read this book because it seemed interesting and happened to be glaring at me in every bookstore I went into (a 30% discount was the clincher). I have not read any of Dan Brown's other books but had watched \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", which I found fairly entertaining. 'The Lost Symbol' was a page-turner. I generally like Brown's writing style; short chapters (some just one page) is a great idea too since it gives you the illusion of the book being shorter than it really is and keeps you reading.    The story has to do with Freemasons in the US and the legend that they guard some ancient wisdom that will change the world. The story tries to get religion into science's 'bed' at science's 'place' rather than at religion's. Fortunately, in reality, science doesn't bring just anyone home and let them get into its bed. In the story, there seems to be that age-old longing for 'something more' (we are not just apes!) and a desperation to get our brightest minds to finally acknowledge it (which might explain the mighty Harvard professor Robert Langdon's main role; the man that needs to be 'convinced'). There were some genuinely interesting twists and surprises that would look good on the silver screen too. Even so, I found some parts, especially toward the end, to be overly-descriptive about buildings and locations. However majestic and fantastic some places in Washington may appear to be, it does not lend an additional iota of credibility to claims about human thoughts being able to manipulate matter. It's a good thing this book purports to be nothing more than fiction; or does it?     Overall, the story was pure entertainment for me. The best and most-developed character was no doubt Mal'akh. At the start, I was ready to give this book 5 stars and halfway through, 4, but by the end, I couldn't honestly rate it more than 3 stars. I just might purchase his next book, however; especiallyif it explores some of the wonders of science itself. The real 'answers' may lie with science in the *future* and not with religions in the past. Dan should probably invent a new 'skeptic' too (one who need not necessarily be from the-only-university-with-credible-professors).
B0041VIJQG|5.0|And let's not forget the amazing musicianship of Darrell Scott - not sure why no one is mentioning this.  The man must eat, drink, sleep and breath music - just part of who he is.  If you ever saw him live, you'd get what I mean here.  I'm not surprised that Plant was smart enough to choose a musician like Scott but am very surprised not to hear the banter about his contribution as we see with Miller and Griffin.  I do hope that changes.  He is truly one of a kind!
B00371QQ2U|5.0|I was so happy to see that my purchase had arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I would definitely purchase from here again!
1439181780|2.0|I was initially happy to see the new book out since I liked The Secret, but with this book she goes on and on and on...and on about love, to the point where it makes you gag. Also no credit is given to Abraham-Hicks where she initially got the concept of The Secret and that has always kind of annoyed me even though I did like the movie very much.  It's kind of like she stole the idea from them or at least borrowed the key concepts without giving any credit.
B003EYVXYQ|5.0|Not the best Romero film out there, but still a good addition to genre nonetheless. I can't believe some of the low ratings I've seen. I am aware that this is not the best of Romero but compared to some of the other recent zombie films I've watched(Automaton Transfusion, Undead, etc), this movie is great.     As long as George keeps making his Dead films, I'll keep watching them.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Ridley Scott's version of Robin Hood isn't the version you're used to. This tells the mythical story of Robin Hood before he became an outlaw and lived in Sherwood Forest. Of course the story of Robin Hood is one of a lot of mythology and possibly a little bit of fact. No one knows the real story. Chances are that film/book depictions of \\"Robin Hood\\" are completely wrong, so it's difficult to say if this movie is realistic in any way, shape, or form - minus the historical accuracies dealing with the king of England.    This version of Robin Hood is probably the best I've seen. It's very entertaining, and not a \\"big, dumb action movie.\\" It's not on the level of Ridley's Gladiator, but I think it's a big leap ahead of Kingdom of Heaven (the theatrical release, at least).    The problem with Robin Hood is the ending. *Warning: spoilers ahead if you don't know the story of Robin Hood* I have not seen the director's cut yet but I would hope that between the final 2 scenes in the film there's something stuck in between them as a bridge. You go from a pretty mediocre beach battle to the king declaring Robin Hood as an outlaw. It feels like they had to cut something, or they just got tired with the film and wanted it to end and they rushed through the final scenes. At any rate, the film almost completely falls apart at the end, though the shots of Robin Hood going into Sherwood Forest make up for a bit.     Ultimately, this is one of the most watchable films of the last couple of years. It's not perfect by any stretch, but it's entertaining and one that I could watch over and over again. It has that kind of vibe to it. Other films I put in that category (in recent release) are the Hurt Locker, Shutter Island, The Wrestler. Just films that I can watch and be entertained by no matter how many times I've seen them. That's good company, and though critics panned Robin Hood, you should give it a shot. As I said, from a technical standpoint I can see it's flaws, but this is a very entertaining movie, and sometimes that's good enough for me.
0385504225|4.0|Im starting to see a little formula with books from dan brown... get a good looking but smart woman, with a nice background.... get an old \\"important\\" but in trouble friend... mix with mysterious kidnapper/killer... glazed in a lot of \\"secrets\\" and symbols... sprinkle a law enforcement agent which one doubts his or hers alliance... and we get any dan brown novel with robert langdon... BUT having said that... the book is great... it may be the same thing with a different background but still i could not stop reading...  maybe a good story is great no matter how many times you read it... or maybe all great stories are alike... but one thing is for sure... i was entertained... i was not expecting this book to change my life i just wanted a nice relaxed weekend on the beach house and this book was icing on the cake... recommend you buy it
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I haven't seen this Tinkebell yet, but I am pre-ordering it. The Tinkerbell series are the most beautiful animated series  from Disney I have ever seen. I love the first and the second. I should actually own them by now:-) Dont miss this oppurtunity to get this for yourself, oh yeah, 4 the kids too, its that great!
B003V5PPZG|1.0|If you bought this thinking l.p. returned to their old..(which was AWESOME) sound, sorry. The original Linkin Park which was rock/rap may be gone forever. After the WEEK Minutes to Midnight album you think they would want to bring their old fans back. I guess they don't care about us. If you like justin bieber or any other pop acts out today you will like this ALOT!!!!
B003UYUR10|3.0|I watched this movie in theaters and apart from it, being visually pleasing, I didnt care for it. I mean if you have a good looking guy like, Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie and I dont care 4 it, truly it wasnt that good. The storyline was boring and predictable, but the special effects are good to look at. I wouldnt buy it on Blu-ray. Nope. Epic Fail here Disney. Maybe Disney should not have done it. It needed to be done by Universal maybe, it would have been better. Disney softens up everything.

0316098337|5.0|Emma Donoghue is not afraid of making bold choices.  Her first is the narrative voice she adapts: that of five-year-old Jack, a young boy who was born and has lived his entire life in an 11-foot by 11-foot room.  One might think the voice would eventually become cloying or overly precious or manipulative or downright tiring.  But it never does.<br /><br />Jack is an innocent, an imaginative child, whose mother was spirited away by an abductor (called Old Nick) when she was returning home from her college library.  She has lived in Room ever since - for seven long years - and gave birth to Jack, the son of her abductor, within Room (a sound-proofed, lead-lined backyard shed).  And she has tried her best to fashion a life for him there, creating innovative games -- from the Scream (done once a day), to Labyrinth and Fort and Bouncy Bunny.  Together, Ma and Jack have created characters out of all aspects of Room - Rug, Plant, Wardrobe, Stove - watch the world on their small T.V. set, and devote every ounce of energy to each other.<br /><br />The horror of this confinement is racheted up through Jack's simplistic view of the Room, which to him, constitutes the world.  He hides in Wardrobe at night and times Old Nick's visits by counting the number of creaks in the bed.  He senses when Ma is \\"Gone\\"-depressed and withdrawn -- and yet can't quite reason out why.  But Ma is more attuned to the threats:  she knows that as Jack ages, he is in increasing danger and that his budding curiosity will eventually cause him fatal harm.<br /><br />Eventually choices are made and freedom comes, but at a cost.  And when it does, Ms. Donoghue develops some bold and powerful themes:  is the Room we know safer than the World Outside?  Is it better to have multiple choices or just a restrictive few?  Are we all confined in a Room of our making - even when we choose freedom or have it thrust upon us - or will we eventually find the strength to break out?<br /><br />As Jack yearns for the security and predictability of Room, Ma tells him, \\"I keep messing up.  I know you need me to be your ma but I'm having to remember how to be me as well at the same time...\\"  The scariest thing for Ma is the fear that Room has obliterated who she really is.  And for Jack?  The scariest thing is a world without being the core of Ma's universe.<br /><br />This riveting book - a book I easily place in my Top Five of the year - goes far beyond the victim-and-survivor tale.  It's an amazing and sensitive look about a mother's love, a study of a \\"stranger in a strange land\\", a tale that displays the power of survival, and an indictment of a society that has lost the ability to empathize with those who are hurting (Ms. Donoghue's wickedly humorous look at the media and its over-the-top rhetoric is reason enough to buy ROOM.)  Most of all, it's a careful examination of how we can take the most heinous circumstances and painstakingly extract something of beauty and value.<br /><br />I cannot praise ROOM enough.  It's a triumph of story-telling filled with crackling dialogue, thought-provoking themes, and a page-turning quality that won't let you stop until you reach the last page.om, Ma tells him, \\"I keep messing up.

1931559317|5.0|in the introduction to this \\"pocket sky atlas\\", roger sinnott asks the reader to \\"think of this as your *working* sky atlas\\". it is extremely well designed: pocket sized (6\\" x 9\\"), spiral bound (you can fold it in half, subway style), relatively large scale charts (5 degrees to the inch), containing all \\"finder scope\\" stars down to magnitude 7.6, and very legible under red light.     there are four detail charts (pleiades, orion nebula, virgo/leo galaxy clusters, and large magellanic cloud), and an index that separately lists all named stars, messier objects, caldwell objects, and deep sky objects (galaxies, open clusters, globular clusters, bright nebulae, dark nebulae and planetary nebulae by NGC, IC or other catalog number, indicated the chart(s) where each object can be found.     charts are arranged as details within a pole to pole slice or \\"gore\\" of the sky, which makes it convenient to browse and hunt objects that are near the meridian at different times of the year. perhaps all that is missing are some tables listing sunrise and sunset, UT/local time conversions, and a magnitude labeled polar star chart to use in visual tests of transparency and light pollution.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I love this new music from Robert Plant.  The music on \\"Band Of Joy\\" is hard to classify. Each song sounds so different. \\"Angel Dance\\" is the kind of song that fills me with hope. This is my favorite song partly because of the fantastic beat and the mandolin playing by Buddy Miller.  My other favorite track is \\"Harm's Swift Way\\". This is a beautiful song about the passage of time.  Byron House provides a goregous bass sound with his instrument here.  \\"You Can't Buy My Love\\" is a funky groovy love song. Marco Giovino gives this song a pulsating beat on the drums. This song is in stark contrast to the song \\"I'm Falling In Love Again\\". This is a song is a much slower tempo tune. I love the lap steel guitar playing by Darrell Scott on this track. Patty Griffin duets with Robert on the song \\"House Of Cards\\".  They sound good vocally together on this track.  This song is about the finality of life. \\"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" is a tune with a religious theme. I love the banjo playing on this track.  \\"Even This Shall Pass Away\\" is the last track.  This song is a funky trip of a tune. I love the guitar riffs on this song. \\"Silver Rider\\" sounds kind of bleak at first, but the more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.  \\"The Only Sound That Matters\\" is a sweet love song.  I love the tone of the song.  \\"Monkey\\" is a dark sounding tune.  The bass playing gives this song an eerie quality.  I absolutely love how Robert mixes up the tempo and theme of each song.  \\"Band Of Joy\\" is  entertaining new music.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|This as a great movie. Follows the book great. I have the movie 5 stars.   DO NOT BUY the blu-ray/dvd single disc combo. The quality isn't as good because the blu-ray is on one side of the disc and the dvd is on the other side. Summit is just trying to cut corners and save money. I hope they release a real blu-ray of this movie.
0688156819|5.0|i love this book so much i gave is as a gift to my friends 6 months old baby, and my friends 4 year old daughter, as well as my 21 years old nephew.they all loved it!! (never too early to get them started on a bit of unconventional journey) it is an imaginative and funny book- no matter what your age is. fun for the parents to read , and i think kids have a whole different way of seeing and getting the bizarre characterless. don't hesitate to buy this. it is also a beautiful looking book from the quality cover,to the cute drawings.
0470477237|5.0|I had heard about the Socialnomics book through several videos on YouTube -- all of which provided valuable statistics that finally drew me in and I bought the book.    Once home I devoured about 50 pages and have been feverishly reading since. This book is different. There are others out there that promise returns for your business, but these are on the whole false and the offerings within their pages are akin to the same old marketing planning done by our fathers and grandfathers... except on the Internet -- as a social media marketer myself, I can tell you first hand that these methods are as worthwhile as telling someone you have a bread slicer... bread already comes sliced!    What sets Socialnomics aside from it's counterparts is that it EXPLAINS the why and the how, it doesn't just say, \\"Here's how you do it now shut up and comply.\\" Just as a small child wants to know how things work, the serious social media marketer needs to know how social media works before they can appreciate the results it garners. Qualman delivers precisely this in his book and the metrics it will create when you \\"get it\\" will change how you see things.     The Internet is not a plaything, it's the most powerful marketing tool perhaps ever engineered. Qualman has given us the why, the how, and the history of how this came to be. To boot, it's a fun read!
0553805371|5.0|When Hawking sticks with physics (99%of the book), the Grand Design is mind-blowing. On the few occasions when he waxes philosophical and theological, he unfortunately looses his scientific moorings and makes value judgments beyond his pay grade. Just like the egotisim of religion that has led to the conviction of Galileo for embracing the Copernican \\"heresy\\" by the church, the egotisim of scientific knowing (the theory of everything) apparently leads to the tempting myth of knowing everything else (philosophy, theology, metaphysics) as well. This book is an amazing status report on the nature of scientific reality. Stay tuned for new editions of reality.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|As a fan of the original, this movie stood on it's own.  Why? Because even though the title was that of the original, the story stood alone.  It was wonderful to see Jackie Chan in something other than a comedy.  And Jaden is a rising star.  If you were comparing it to the original then you missed out because it wasn't. I plan to add it to my library along side with the first one.  BTW in the original the lead clearly was not a martial artist but in the remake you can see that Jackie Chan of course and Jaden Smith are both highly skilled.
0345495004|2.0|I suppose it's my fault for not reading up on the history of Frank Lloyd Wright and/or Mamah Borthwick before picking up this novel, because even as a divorcee who feels more love--and more constant love--for her second husband than her first, I simply cannot wrap my head around this particular relationship (not to mention--SPOILER ALERT--its gruesome ending). While it is obvious that Ms. Horan did plenty of research and tried to make both Wright and Borthwick's characters as realistic as possible, a combination of the story itself and the way she wrote it left me feeling at times bored, at times annoyed, and always just wanting the book to end. If you are looking for a love story, this isn't the novel for you. If you are looking for a man-and-woman-change-the-world story, this isn't the novel for you. If you are looking for a quick read and/or writing that will wrap you up in the characters and their story...again, this is NOT the novel for you. Not the worst book I've ever read, but not a good one, either. 2.5/5 stars at best.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I listen to a lot of blues and got this CD out of curiosity, having heard one song on satellite radio.  I wondered how Cyndi Lauper could even consider the blues.  That said, I found it to be an entertaining work and she picked her collaborators and the music to suit her voice and style. I'm not a fan of hers but I listen to this CD and loan it to others to experience.
B000067CPX|5.0|Thirty years from now, and for longer after that, this album will be remembered as one of the best pop albums ever, in the ranks of The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band. Long after the silly debate about punk-funk tube-socks-wearing Chili Peppers versus the Frusciante-melody-driven version, listeners on earth (if earth will still exist) will agree that this collection of perfectly written and perfectly performed songs is pure genius music. The guitar sounds on this are some of the most beautiful I have heard; bless you, John Frusciante, for making our lives a little more gorgeous. This album, listened to in its magical entirety, will be a classic. And not just because I can't stop listening to it non-stop for the last week, and for much of the 8 years since its release!

B003A4IFGY|5.0|I always listen to an album completely 2 or 3 times before forming an opinion. This one got me on the 2nd listen. Petty takes a blues approach to several songs on this album and it works wonderfully. \\"Running Man's Bible\\" is a jam from start to finish. The \\"Trip to Pirate's Cove\\" and \\"Something Good Coming\\" are a return to album oriented rock. This CD has become one of my favorites of all time. This is a perfect album to put on when you're on a long drive down the highway. Enjoy!

Susie tries her best from Heaven to make things right and hold her family together. In the end, the family remains intact and Mr. Harvey gets his. Awesome book. I can only hope that the &#34;afterlife&#34; is just like the one in this story. Excellently written. I will hold my children just a little bit tighter tonight...

B000001ELP|5.0|First off if you weren't around or in to music from 1975 to 1981 you have no idea how big KISS was.They were huge everybody had KISS shirts or belt buckles or something of KISS.KISS was just as popular for their look as their music as strange as that seems.But they  had alienated their core fans after two non-KISS albums.Then they had the nerve to put this album  out!No KISS pictures any where on the album, not to mention being an odd concept album.  Flash forward to the present and listen to it. You will be surprised what a masterpiece it is. Who ever thought KISS was this talented.No body would give it a chance then but now go buy it.Its a great Concept album.Catchy songs and great music.Then go buy another hidden masterpiece from the eighties \\"Imaginos\\" by BLUE OYSTER CULT.Both awesome concept albums.

I played some GOW III, NHL 11 and MW2 with this, trying to convince myself that it didn't completely suck. But lets face it folks when we lie to ourselves, deep down somewhere we know we're full of it.    I could have overlooked springy joysticks. And the throw away d-pad. I could have even gotten over the weird, spongy trigger fail(also the trigger edges can't fit the ps3 trigger ad-ons for the DS3 controller).    The 360 controller is far superior to DS3 in every area except d-pad. This controller is far superior to a turd in that it merely functions like a steaming pile of [...] instead of also smelling like one. Someone will hopefully, eventually get the 360 controller port right, but the nincompoops at Power A will not make the history books with this flawed, barely functional attempt.    Giving this a strong DO NOT BUY, unless you feel like explaining to all your friends why your new paperweight looks like an xbox controller. The only astounding thing it managed to do was actually make me happy to hold my PS3 controller again, after I had to bandage my shredded, bleeding hands. All in all the experience was like cheating on your significant other with someone very hot and appealing, who winds up giving your hands syphilis... stay home and enjoy what you have kids.
0618918248|4.0|I'm a part of the atheist choir to which Dawkins is preaching; but I honestly believe that this book might change a religious person's mind, if they bothered to pick it up (I've been hearing a lot about how many religious congregations are condemning Dawkins's work as a tool of Satan). It's full of scientific goodness, and refutations of common defenses of religion and attacks upon atheism. Suddenly, I don't feel so alone. It's well known how many horrors are perpetrated in the name of religion, but Dawkins manages to unearth a few more of which I'd never heard. There's also a great chapter on the many hypocrisies of the Bible - and there are plenty more than what I'd even been using in prior arguments with religious friends.

0765326353|5.0|I got this from audible.com .   This was an awesome story and is comparable to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  Which should come as no surprise since Sanderson is currently finishing the last book broken into three parts that Mr. Jordan left a rough draft of.  I definitely think that Jordans's style and Sanderson attempts to write in it finishing that series have definitely left an impression.  This book, while being a unique story to Sandersons universe has patterns similar to the Wheel of Time's epic fantasy.  A prologue in the first book that starts thousands of years before the main story with characters that shape the history of the world for the main characters.  Roving viewpoints of different characters that will become important later on and a brilliant magical system that is still for the most part unrevealed in its complexity in this first book.  Also the different viewpoints of the major character reveal something different about the countries and religions and philosophy of the people, their countries and world.  Keladins and Delinars views are contrasts in somethings.  While this is definitely reminiscent to the Wheel of Times Eye of the World in some ways, the is a bold new story that has Branden Sanderson's own unique element and style to it.  This might be the next wheel of time like epic fantasy for this decade.
0743454537|5.0|I really enjoyed this story... We are told how Kates illness is affecting her family in different ways.. We have Jesse, the older brother, we are taken through his whole life, possibly the incident where he didnt get to go with his father on a trip to try out his skateboard when he was 11 to a skating area as promised because Kate is rushed to hospital is where Jesse first becomes rebellious and attention seeking. Anna, genetically selected to be a close donor match for Kate is seen as someone who is constantly used for body parts for her sister. We are taken through her life, from the day she was born, where her mother is more interested in how her birth can benefit Kate than Anne herself. We re also told how there is no baby photos of Anne round the house.  Brian, the father and fire fighter. We re shown the difficult time he has with dealing with what is happening to Anna, something that her mother Sara, doesn't even seem to notice.  He also figures out what is going on with Jesse whom Sara doesn't seem to know exists.  Sara as you ve probably figured out is my least favourite character... She's horrible and difficult to sympathise with to be honest. She seems to find it difficult to see past Kate who is kept as a bit of a mystery throughout the book.  Jesse is left to his own throughout this story as his parents have lost hope in him. We see him as being very close to Anna. Campbell Anna's lawyer brings the humour into the novel, I really enjoyed his character and the subplot of his relationship with Julia.     A few people have commented on not liking the ending of this story as Picoult did not answer questions raised in the novel, but with a lot of Jodi's books she raises questions for the mind to ponder that are left purposely unanswered... I don't see this as a cop out as some reviews have said there just are no answers to these questions in this story more so that any other, it would be impossible to know what is right and what is wrong.

0307454541|3.0|This book doesn't really need any more reviews, but since I read it, I might as well chime in. Like many others, I found it slow to start, and I got frustrated trying to follow all the members of the Vangar family - the wealthy Swedish industrialist family that the plot revolves around. I had expected more of a beach-read, in terms of the effort required, but this is considerably more work than that. It also is a very dark and twisted plot - SM and serial killers and the like. And I found parts of the ending a little unsatisfying, which is really a problem in a murder mystery - the conclusion is usually the payoff, when justice is served. In this case, it doesn't feel entirely like justice has been served, and that was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />On the plus side, the 2nd half was compelling, and I couldn't put it down for the last 100 pages. I personally liked the 'editorial' aspects of the book - the commentary on the financial markets, and the corruption there, that runs as a sub-theme of the book. And I did come to care about Lisbeth, the 'girl with the dragon tattoo', although she's a twisted, damaged soul, for sure.<br /><br />So, a mixed experience for me, and still not sure whether I want to commit to reading the next one or not.
0439023483|5.0|I haven't been so engrossed by a book in a long, long time. Without giving spoilers (and if you want those, there are many reviews on here that you could read), I'd say this book left me hungry for more. Starving, actually. The day I finished \\"The Hunger Games\\" I ran out and bought its sequel, \\"Catching Fire\\" as well as the third book, \\"Mockingjay\\". Normally I just check out books from the library, but I had to own these ones. They're that good.<br /><br />Keep in mind that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a Young Adult book, which means it's geared at teens ages 14 to 21. Some people seem to think the violence in this book was a bit too much for younger readers, and they're right. But that's why this book is Young Adult--NOT Juvenile (there is a difference). If you're a parent, take note of this.
1423101499|5.0|Just as every Harry Potter book began with the requisite tormenting of the Dursley family, every Percy Jackson book begins with the destruction of a school, a trend that continues in the forth book starring the young demi-god son of Poseidon. Unless you're familiar with the three previous books, you'll probably find yourself lost with what's going on here. About to celebrate his fifteenth birthday party, Percy is still up to his neck in problems, ranging from his mother's new boyfriend to the Greek monsters that keep trying to kill him. Luckily he has his friends to help him out: the satyr Grover, who is on a quest for the missing god Pan, his half-brother Tyson, a Cyclops, and Annabeth, the daughter of Athena - except lately Annabeth has been acting a little strangely...<br /><br />After rejoining his friends at Camp Half-Blood, the summer camp for teenagers who have one divine and one mortal parent, Percy learns of the latest activities of Olympus's enemies. Led by ex-camp member Luke Castellan, with the goal of resurrecting the evil Titan Kronos, a range of monsters are attempting to invade the camp and eradicate the half-bloods. Their idea is to use the legendary Labyrinth as their way in. The Labyrinth was designed by the famous inventor Daedalus, and though it was originally located on the island of Crete, it has since grown and evolved to encompass the entire earth - it's the perfect underground traveling system, *if* one can navigate it properly.<br /><br />Percy's only option is to go down himself, find Daedalus's workshop in the centre of the maze, and beg him not to help Luke find his way out. This is not as simple as it sounds considering the monsters that dwell there, the ever-changing tunnels and passages, and the fact that it can drive people crazy if they're down there too long. Led by Annabeth and joined by Grover and Tyson, the quartet of heroes have a range of obstacles and personal challenges to overcome, in what is another fast-paced and humor-filled adventure that successfully builds on the growing plots of the previous books without repeating itself.<br /><br />Although [[ASIN:1423101480 The Titan's Curse]] remains my favorite installment (so far), \\"Battle of the Labyrinth\\" has the most cohesive plot. In previous books the story-lines can be a bit haywire, with our protagonists running about with no clear idea of what they're doing or why, but here the goals are decided upon swiftly and the set-backs faced with maturity. Our heroes are growing in more ways than one, and for the first time a touch of tension exists between Percy and Annabeth that has nothing to do with their external circumstances. Other little subplots and mysteries are continued (such as Nico de Angelo's misplaced anger at Percy for the death of his sister) or introduced (a new teacher known as Mr Quintus seems to have an unclear agenda at the camp), and resolved in satisfactory ways.<br /><br />The Labyrinth is a great imaginative effort, a large semi-conscious organism that is ever-changing and evolving, filled to the brim with monsters, traps, secrets and danger. Percy and his friends certainly find more than they expect down there, and Riordan has great fun satirizing certain aspects of contemporary culture, updating the old Greek myths in clever ways (I loved his take on the riddle-speaking sphinx).<br /><br />I'm always amazed by the sheer amount of material that Riordan manages to pack into any one Percy Jackson book without things getting slow. There's even room for a poignant chapter in which Percy comes across Calypso's island and finds himself faced with the same dilemma that Odysseus of old once did. There's also a reappearance from Rachel Elizabeth Dare, the mortal who can see through the concealing Mist that hides supernatural activities from normal human beings, a visit to Triple G Ranch where the steeds and cattle of the gods are pastured, resolution to Grover's attempts to find Pan, and an introduction to Hera, the Queen of Heaven. Whew!<br /><br />By the end of the book the game has changed, the stakes have been raised, and we're all one step closer to the prophecy that dictates either Percy or Nico will make a world-changing decision in the coming battle between Titans and Olympian Gods in the fifth and final book: [[ASIN:1423101472 The Last Olympian]].e book the game has changed, the stakes have been raised, and we're all one step closer to the prophecy that dictates either Percy or Nico will make a world-changing decision in the coming battle between Titans and Olympian Gods in the fifth and final book: [[ASIN:1423101472 The Last Olympian]].
0061765236|5.0|This is the kind of book you just cant leave down, I just wanted to find out what happens at the end. The way Picoult changed from the past to present while telling the story made it seem like two stories in one and made it even more interesting. Your drawn into the story, you want to see the guy workin in the takeaway answer for what he done. Picoult as usual with her books leaves questions unanswered for you to think about when you finish reading the book, What was in that diary? Really enjoyed this book from Picoult.
B000784WMW|2.0|Zelah Clarke makes a plain Jane.  Timothy Dalton makes a perhaps titch too dashing Mr. Rochester,  but I'll breathlessly forgive him that.  He is in turn gruff, stern, stiff, guarded, twinkling, flirty, impassioned and open.  He maintains a starch formality throughout that rings authentic to Rochester's class and time, leaking just enough warmth now and again to hint at his underlying passion.    I can almost forgive Zelah Clarke for being too olde for the role.  What I cannot get past is the utter lack of even a drop of charisma.  Given that she must somehow overcome her lowly station and plain looks to unwittingly win the heart of Mr. Rochester, there must be SOMETHING attractive about her. A great personality?  The camera lingers on her subtly expressive eyes, ostebsibly so that they may narrate her unspoken emotions.  But, one is still left to wonder, whatever does Rochester see in her?      ZERO chemistry.  Whatever fine acting may be taking place on the screen, neither actor is playing off the other.  It's almost as if two renditions were filmed--the virile Dalton smouldering to a broom handle and the mousy Clarke being flattened in every scene by the overpowering Rochester.    If you live and breath the book, perhaps you will fill in the emotionally blank spots and really enjoy this version.  The puzzle pieces never fell together for me.
B000002KB8|5.0|I didn't get this first release from Ozzy Osbourne, Toni Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward until I was 16 years old, a full 10 years after it was released.  I was instantly hooked.  As a matter of fact, after getting it on vinyl in Iowa, I got the international version of the album in Tokyo 3 years later due to the higher quality manufacturing and lyrics always accompanying Japanese vinyl.  And of course, I later got it on CD.<br /><br />While the title track and \\"The Wizard\\" got the most play off this particular release, the entire set of songs is superb.  If you consider what was out at the time, there were very few metal bands around and literally none with the same riffs the amazing Tony Iommi came up with.  Ozzy's voice, although still excellent today, was loud and crisp on this self-titled debut.<br /><br />Let's face it: this is a true classic work of art that started an era of uniqueness never again likely to be repeated.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|How easy would it be for Robert Plant to rest on his laurels, live on past glories and occasionally resurrect that popular beat combo Led Zeppelin for the odd lucrative tour? It is to his huge credit that as he gets older his musical journey takes more adventurous twists and turns, heading into constantly interesting and diverse new territory with a restlessness that would put many younger artists to shame. Another bonus is at the age of 62 his voice just gets better and better. Listen to the whole album now streaming on New Public Radio (NPR) it is a true wonder.<br /><br />It is also the case that many had expected Plant to reconvene his wonderful collaboration with Alison Krauss and produce \\"Raising Sand part 2\\". But it appears that despite a number of recent sessions with her it didn't quite recapture the initial magic and Plant admits in the latest edition of Mojo that \\"you can only spend so trying to get it right\\". So what we have is the resurrection of a previous band name but a whole new set of musical collaborations which overall is effortless and a stonkingly good listen. And how could it not be? His hand-picked bunch of Nashville session musicians are made up veteran guitarist Buddy Miller's, drummer Marco Giovino, bassist Byron House, multi-instrumentalist Daryl Scott's pedal steel and to add the proverbial icing to the cake one of the queens of country Patty Griffin is present to provide possibly one the most experienced vocal foils in the history of modern music. Frankly this lot could play on combs and spoons and it would sound great.<br /><br />The music follows the Raising Sand template and draws from a wide musical palette of gospel, country, blues and rock. Plant tackles head on songs ranging from artists as diverse as East LA's finest Los Lobos to those Kings of quiet slow core introspection the Minnesota trio \\"Low\\". Indeed I am and struggling to think of a better song I have heard this year than the moody but graceful Low cover \\"Silver Rider\\" (but see also \\"Monkey\\") with its echo laden guitar from Miller and tender vocals from Plant and Griffin. As it builds into a powerful force of nature you struggle to think of any song on the peerless Raising Sand which could have matched it and it improves on the original. The pace of opener \\"Angel Dance\\" which is a Los Lobos cover is altogether different full of looping guitar rhythms and an excellent upbeat vocal by Plant. Every more jaunty is the Beatles like \\"You cant buy my love\\" performed recently on the Andrew Marr show which Plant tells us that he first heard on compilation disk and is essentially a counterpart to the Fabs song recorded originally by the R&B star Barbara Lynn. In \\"The only sound that matters\\" Plant's project has unearthed a little known country gem which is genuinely lovely; alternatively he then returns us to Low's seventh album \\"The Great Destroyer\\" with an immaculate cover of its opener \\"Monkey\\", which is jam packed with raw/sinister power, angry guitar and some echoes of its distant cousin which is Radiohead's \\"Climbing up the walls\\". Plant and Griffin are immense on this and his patronage will also hopefully lead curious music lovers to explore the wonders of Low or check Mark Kozelek's cover versions.<br /><br />Space forbids extended dialogue on the atmospheric gospel blues of \\"Satan your kingdom must come down\\", the great cover of Richard Thompson's \\"House of Cards\\" where Griffin's backing vocals come more to the forefront and \\"Central Two-o-nine\\" which is one of those great American train songs where you can almost hear the lonesome whistle, smell the smoke and the Appalachian pines. Splendid stuff.<br /><br />For some breathlessly awaiting a Led Zep reunion I suspect this album may not satisfy, not least with the complete absence of hard rocking anthems. Similarly others will find \\"Band of Joy\\" to be a slightly darker and much more Gothic album than the light country air achieved with the gossamer vocals of Krauss on \\"Raising Sand\\".But on repeated listens this is an album that is easily an even match for its predecessor on the the enjoyability scale and the backing musicians throughout are faultless. As the years pass Robert Plant is turning into a true renaissance man with his albums becoming \\"Events\\" and awaited with genuine anticipation. While many of his peers and contemporaries seem largely content to plod on and tread water, you get the feeling that if Plant keeps producing albums of the sheer quality of \\"Band of Joy\\" he will soon be walking onis an album that is easily an even match for its predecessor on the the enjoyability scale and the backing musicians throughout are faultless.

B001IYCMNA|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I know this person has had success, but the success ratio is abysmal.  Just read the CISCO forums on this device.  This device locks up in an odd way.  When this WAP locks up I began watching the logs on our router I see the client being assigned an IP address, but the client machine never gets the IP, hence the client machine times out it's attempt.  This problem is most notable for iPad, Apple laptops and Linux.  It happens less with windows clients, but it still happens.  Only way to unlock is to either re-boot or power-cycle.  Then the WAP works for about 4-6 hours then again if you re-connect it hangs and you never get onto the network.    This thing is so bad, that I have a little workhorse AirLink SuperG as a backup.  The Airlink has NEVER had issues in the 2-3 years I have used it, and it has been up 24/7/365 during that time.  I am actually very disappointed, as are the 216 other posts you will see in the Cisco Forum.  It seems that Cisco when it bought Linksys, put Linksys HW into this device, junky HW, put the CISCO name on it made it look official and then say that it is all the administrators fault.  Well when I see a post with a comment like this: \\"Some time ago I was Cisco certified, so I have had faith in Cisco products. I also sold them for a living, which made it a natural choice, but I am struggling to come to terms with my purchase here.\\" (posted on Cisco's forum 08/29/2010).  There are 45,000+ views of this issue on Cisco's forum.  Cisco is dropping the ball and is acting like every other silo vendor out there by have abysmal customer support.    I tell you now, if you have a heterogeneous network I would steer very clear of this product.    And just so I can counter the \\"well Linux always has wireless issues\\", think again.  I have been in several hospitals, my network at home and other hotspots where I was on and off those networks several times a day and NEVER had connection issues.  But this \\"THING\\", give it 4-6 hours max after power cycling and LOCKUP and no new connections allowed.

0307454541|3.0|First off, I'm glad I waited my turn at the library and didn't spend money on this book.  It was OK, but I have no idea how it has turned into the phenomenon it has.  Though the main plotline is cool (the mystery of Harriet), the book relies heavily on shock value, and the over-the-top sexual violence felt gratuitous.  The translation into English is clumsy at best--my version was a trade paperback, so it had to go through at least SOME editing right??  Badly done.  As to 'The Girl', if I ever met Lisbeth, I think I would slap her and tell her to get over herself (or at least get some credible professional help).  Her extreme strength vs. extreme weakness, with zero middle ground was annoying and I could care less what the future holds for her (ie. no 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' for me). Did anyone else feel at times the book was actually one lllooooonnggg advertisement for Apple (and slam on PCs? Remember the whole wiz-bang-secondary-plotline's villian used a IBM laptop...) Ehhh...maybe the movie will be better???
B003V5PPZG|3.0|I'm trying to come at this review from a netural stand point beeing a fan of their older work and which this is not like at all. I can say while fliping threw the tracks on my mp3 player i did spend more time deleteing then anything, but I also found a few gems that i also really liked.  The sad part about this album isnt the far sound of HT , but the fact most of the songs are intros, now i dont mind intros they did in meteora track one was an intro for 'don't stay' but it seems every other track is an INTRO, which makes 15 tracks disapointing.  (I really thought it was 15 songs...oh well) There is alot of mellow songs on this alumb as well, they're not terrable but if your use to Chester screaming his behind off its not in this alumb I only really heard him screaming in one song called 'blackout' i wasnt a big fan but its the closest they got to a HT sound on this alumb.  Also there seems to be a few just rap songs on this alumb. I myself never really liked the rap accpect so I wasnt a big fan, but if you loved the rap accpect of LP u'd probably love 'when they come to get me'.  Over all only two songs stood out for me on this alumb which is sorta sad i littery loved every track on 'meteora'  My favs '14- the catalyst' and '3-burring in the sky'.  Both have great lyrics.  Beeing a lyric junky words and meanings to a song mean the world to me, more so then the music, others i could stand was 'iridescent' 'fall out'(an intro) and thats about it.  This alumb is sort of a disapointment, but all i can suggest for fans is to listen to the mp3s and just down load the songs u like. u'd save some money and  with all the intros u'd feel like u wasted 15 bucks.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B0019N8P2W|3.0|One of the few reasons to buy a DVD, instead of other options, is the DVD commentary.  The lack of DVD commentary, given the other negatives, like the replaced music, pretty much makes the DVD a bad value.

I wished they had included the notation from the back of the CD.

B0014DFCMS|3.0|Here is one of my favorite classic parts - there's a particular line I love that Juno (Ellen Page) quotes in the film after Mark Loring discovers her coming out of the upstairs bathroom in his house!  Right after she finds the ad in the Pennysaver for Mark and Vanessa Loring, goes to their house and meets them, she says \\"Being pregnant makes me pee like seabiscuit!\\"    Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner) says the downstairs bathroom is being re-tiled, so she directs her specifically which direction to go in when she gets upstairs.  Juno interrupts and says \\"Yeah, the room with the toilet!\\"  When Juno finds the bathroom, she steals a squirt of Vanessa's perfume and puts it on her wrist, right at the edge of the sleeve of her flannel plaid shirt.  She then sees Mark in the hall and asks if Vanessa sent him up to spy on her.  Juno confesses and says \\"I stole of your wife's perfume; it's Clinique Happy.  Get a wiff of those fumes!\\"    Mark responds \\"Is that supposed to make me happy?\\"    Here is my favorite line Juno responds with.  She says \\"You should be happy - I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of Life.  Sweet, screaming, pooping life and you don't even have to be there when it comes out all covered in blood and guts!\\"  (Obviously she was reminding Mark about the pressures of dealing with a newborn infant, just being blunt.)  It's true, you have to help calm the baby down when he/she screams and cries.  Obviously, the baby will soil hundreds of diapers during his/her first three years and it's not fun at all to have to keep changing them - but someone has to if he's a father and/or she's a mother; biological or adopted!    Afterwards, she goes on to notice \\"Kimber\\" in the room behind Mark in the background - his guitar.  She asked him if it's a Les Paul and he talks about how expensive it was to get it fixed when he cracked the shell of it long ago.  They then start having fun getting into a jam session.  Unfortunately, Vanessa comes up and has to interrupt them and remind Juno how their attorney (\\"Gerta Rauss\\" played by Eileen Pedde) is downstairs waiting and they have paperwork to finish signing.    Also, I thought it was funny after they arrived how Juno's father Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) saw Vanessa's Pilates machine in the living room.  He asked what it was and asked what you \\"make\\" with it.  I just think that's funny how naïve he was to understand it was fitness equipment!    Obviously, Vanessa responded \\"You don't make anything - it's for exercise!\\"    Another cute line at the beginning of that scene is when they first arrive and Vanessa has a big smile on her face when she happily welcomes them into her home.  I love when she offers them something to drink and says \\"I have Pellegrino or Vitamin Water.....\\"    It's cute when Juno says \\"I'll have a maker's mart.....\\"    Her father Mac had to say \\"She's kidding - Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor.....\\"
0452286751|4.0|The Fountainhead was published in 1943, the year I was born. So, with that in mind here is my review:<br />Being a mystery and spy thriller reader mostly I committed myself a couple of years ago to reading a few classics along the way to broaden my literature horizen a bit. A friend suggested this novel by Ayn Rand. Of course I'd heard of Rand but wasn't particularly interested in mid-20th century East-Coast intellectualism but in view of my commitment I read and read and read. It is long.<br />I must say that I enjoyed the book but probably not for the reasons many readers do. Rand's ability to describe scenes and characters gets an A from me. I could truely visualize the houses, buildings, clothes, the character's appearances and expressions. And from a psychological perspective, if you enjoy sorting those things out, it raised some interesting issues basic to our human nature. The story, on the other hand, developed too slowly and I admit I scanned a few pages just to get through a laborous chapter or two.<br />If you are looking for a cozy mystery or a lite read to get your mind off of the daily grind The Fountainhead isn't what you are looking for.

It is based on common sense, awareness and a desire to make your relationship a better one.  It includes worksheets that are great for ground work and evaluation.  I have a hard copy and several soft copies that I use with clients.  Great wedding gift, too!
1400156890|3.0|The audio is great if you can play it. Before buying the CD I tried to find out if it came in CD version so that I could play it in my car on my 35 minute commute to wk. I had bought Jane Austin compact disc collection and was able to play it in my car; so I compared it's notes with this version and they both said CD. I wished they had included the notation from the back of the CD.  It would have saved me lots of time in research. on the back of the audio case it says \\"Please note that this MP3-CD will play only on CD and DVD players or computers that have the  ability to play MP3-formatted discs. For more information about MP3 format and MP3-CDs, please visit our website at :  [...],\\" as I was not able to play the CD in my car and visiting the website gave no info on MP3 format and MP3-CDs,needless to say I was a bit disappointed; as I had ordered Northhanger Abbey,Sense and Sensibilitiy and Mansfield Park all with the same format.

B002JVWRAO|5.0|As a long time fan of this show, I was especially eager for the DVD release of Season 5. This has been by far my favorite season. It addresses not only the Judeo-Christian perspective, but perspectives of other religions and mythologies. I've always enjoyed this show's storylines, and this is by far the most intense and emotional. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are two of the greatest talents on television, and the full-time addition of Misha Collins makes it all the better! It is a joy to relive the series over and over again on DVD. I truly needed the DVDs, as well, since my DVR was getting full between Supernatural and Leverage. The DVD collection itself doesn't disappoint. I love the cover art and design this year. The gag reel (a Supernatural DVD tradition) was truly hilarious, and the special features presented in the format of exploring Bobby's house is genius! I can't wait now for season 6!
B0030IIYYS|4.0|Nothing like the responsibility of trying to sequel what is commonly acknowledged as the motion picture that invented the computer animated film genre and yet this is exactly what Pixar was staring at when they set out to build Toy Story 2.<br /><br />And to listen to John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, Lee Unkrich or any of the other Pixar writers and directors charged with the task of making the film a reality and it's clear that rather than worry about the implied responsibilities, they viewed it as an opportunity to continue on in the tradition of the first (while brining in a host of new characters to boot).<br /><br />Toy Story 2 starts off with human boy Andy preparing to head off to cowboy camp with intentions of taking Woody with him.  A last minute rip causes Woody's attendance to be canceled and hence leaves all the toys to their own devices.<br /><br />The plot wastes very little time shifting into high gear when an obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin (owner of Al's Toy Barn) kidnaps Woody from a yard sale.<br /><br />Woody ends up making a most unexpected discovery in Al's possession: that he is in fact a highly valued collectible doll from a 1950s TV show called Woody's Roundup. He meets the other prized toys from that show, Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the Horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector.<br /><br />Buzz Lightyear, meanwhile, with some of the other toys from Andy's room (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex and Hamm) spring into action to rescue their pal from a life behind museum glass. It's high adventure as the toys traverse the city without drawing attention to themselves in effort to track down Al and their missing pal.<br /><br />Truthfully I went into this one with no expectations/ preconceived notions (save for the obvious: this is big budget Disney/ Pixar so it will likely look good).  While the first one was cute enough to be sure, I wasn't quite as enamored with it as the general public so of course learning that the sequel actually generated higher global profits had me curious to say the least.  After having finally watched the Toy Story 2 DVD last night, I can state that this is precisely what Disney/ Pixar does best.<br /><br />Like all of the other Pixar films I've enjoyed throughout the years, Toy Story 2 goes the route of clean models, uncannily fluid animation and detail-rich textures.  Character personality takes the forefront to flashy effects or sheer number of sets used.  However, there is undeniable attention to the younger set with these films (in case the G-rating doesn't drive the point home).<br /><br />Yes, there is humor that can be appreciated by all age groups here but it goes the extra mile to avoid the type of crude or adult-specific jokes common in films like Shrek or Ice Age.  Laughs here are going to be had by all age groups simultaneously and never will there be parents finding themselves struggling to explain a gag to the youngsters.<br /><br />This one could definitely be credited for raising the bar for the series and, contrary to common misconception, not merely because of the advances in computer animating technology between 1995 and 1999.  Considering that the third entry of the series was released in 2010 to critical acclaim, it appears as though Pixar's screenwriters are advancing at the same pace as the technology used to create these masterpieces.ay the least.

1848566190|5.0|Curb Appeal:    At first glance, the book actually reminds me of one of Drew's paintings. It's got a very bold and classic look to the cover. It is a hard cover book, but it's not too heavy and I was able to sit in a chair and read it cover to cover during one sitting in about two hours. I think the weight is an important factor that's worth mentioning as some books are too heavy to hold in your hands and read in one sitting. This one has the perfect balance of size and weight.    Content:    The Forward, which is written by Frank Darabont, really speaks volumes about the current state of movie poster art. He goes into extreme detail about how the \\"suits\\" (studio executives) are responsible for the downfall of real art in the movie poster business and feels that the new digital computer art doesn't hold a candle to the old stuff, which I tend to agree with. This is not a complete life's work of Drew Struzan by any means. The story starts in the early 80's and leads right up to 2008 when he retired. There's a brief section for most of the big films he worked on that explain the sometimes short, but always difficult process of creating the perfect piece that everyone is happy with. He speaks of great success seeing pieces of his work used in some of the most beloved films of our time as well as heartbreak when other works of art were thrown by the wayside. I found it particularly interesting to learn how many comps he had to do for studio executives before they finally agreed on an idea. He mentions that at times, he had nothing to go on and was asked to simply make something up which often turned out to be exactly what the studio wanted and other times, not so much.    Conclusions:    Once again, this is not a record of the complete work of Mr. Struzan, but for fans of his work, it's definitely worth picking up. It's a very easy read made up of 160 pages. You will learn new things about Drew and the processes that he went through when creating his movie poster art while following a common theme throughout the book. This theme represents the unfortunate decline in true movie poster art over the last decade. Today, it seems, studios are only interested in the quickest, easiest and cheapest method of producing movie posters which is why we only see digital cutouts and photo shopped backgrounds on most these days. This makes his amazing work seem all the more important.    Quality:     A lot of care was put into the construction of this book. There are both full color and black & white images throughout with each one shown in perfect resolution. This one will fit nicely on my shelf of encyclopedias and reference books.
0307454541|4.0|I ended up really enjoying most of this book, it was just the first quarter of the book, and the last quarter of the book that didn't interest me.  It took too long to get to some interesting stuff for me, but I was determined to get there anyway. I'm glad I read it though, and I'm now into the second one of the series (which is great so far).<br /><br />I compare this book to a juicy sandwich with dry bread because the middle of the book was fantastic - it was the stuff on the outside that held it together that was a bit dry.
1423113381|3.0|I really debated between giving this book two or three stars. In the end, I did enjoy it (even if I have some major problems with the storyline), so I gave it three.    Warning, this review contains some minor spoilers.    If I had read this before reading Percy Jackson I would have loved it and given it four, maybe five stars. However, because I read Percy Jackson first, the glaring similarities between the two concepts stuck out to me to the point of annoyance.    All in all, the Red Pyramid is essentially Percy Jackson with Egyptian instead of Greek gods. The two main characters are extremely boring and, at times, completely unlikable. Sometimes I just wanted to put duct tape over Sadie's imaginary face so that she'd stop narrating. The two narrators, Sadie and Carter, are almost completely interchangeable besides the fact that Riordan sloppily fits in \\"haha, but you're a boy and boys are smelly and gross\\" or \\"oh dude, girls are so high maintenance and annoying\\" every so often. If not for the note at the top of each chapter I would have gotten lost as to who was telling the story.    That's another thing, the whole, \\"We're recording this in the back of a van on the fly\\" concept is so hard to grasp, mainly because people don't talk like that. If both Sadie and Carter were actually writing the story, I can handle the writing style of this book. It's an over-done concept, but it's fine. Speaking the story and having it transcribed by an author lucky enough to find it? That's just trying too hard. The concept is cute and I'm sure that younger readers would find it enticing, but I found it annoying and hard to believe (it's a fantasy novel, I know, but this is a different kind of \\"hard to believe\\".) I simply cannot suspend my disbelief to readily accept that two barely teen-aged siblings would be able to speak in proper writing form for four-hundred some pages (which I take to mean many, many hours of recording). Hell, if the writing were a little bit less formed andmore conversational this book may have been more interesting.     This is not a bad book and I highly recommend it to younger readers because it's cute, enticing, and does drive the reader to know what happens (even if the ending is unbelievably anti-climactic).    I don't want to discourage people from reading this because I did enjoy it; I just feel as though Riordan can do so much better. I'm looking forward to his new book that comes out in October.
B000065KH4|5.0|The movie can be viewed in either French or English. Binoche, who is perfectly bilingual does both versions. She skillfully persuades an originally hostile community (lead on by a hypocritical mayor and priest) that it is not sinful to enjoy chocolate. An Oscar recipient for her supporting role in The English Patient, Binoche  proves to be an outstanding actress, lovely to look at. I highly recommend the picture, which will also make your mouth water when you see all the luscious chocolate varieties that Binoche  offers.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Why did I give it five stars you might be wondering. Because it's very creative. I realize their first two albums made them who they are but you can't keep releasing the same product over and over again people. If you don't evolve you die. Life is about growth and moving on. This album is very interesting. I have to give it more time. I like all the little interludes.
B003V5PPZG|3.0|At the outset, I expected this to suck. I in fact wanted it to suck so I could just write LP off.     I, like most, loved Hybrid Theory and wore it out. Same thing for Meteora. However, I found Minutes to Midnight to be such a divergence from the LP sound, mixed with unnecessary political commentary, that I just figured they had gone their way. So I truly wanted A Thousand Suns to be terrible.     To my surprise, however, it's not that bad. It definitely doesn't sound anything like Linkin Park used to. Some of the songs are pretty good, but much like other reviewers have stated, the songs all seem to blend together. I guess that was the point of a concept album, but not being around during the Pink Floyd era, I fear the point of this is lost on me to an extent.     At any rate, this wasn't as bad as many of the reviews made it out to be, but certainly not some epochal evolution of music and humanity as other reviews make it out to be. I am left with the distinct impression that some of the \\"artistic\\" choices on this album weren't made for the sake of inspiration, but more so out of some ill conceived desire to be different and once again reinvent themselves, further fragmenting their fanbase between the \\"Hybrid Theory purists\\" and the blindly devoted fans as an after effect.     I count myself more so in the former category, but the bottom line I think is this: Listen to this before buying. This does seem to be an album that evokes strong reactions one way or the other in most people.
B002N2XGVS|5.0|My wife grew up hearing this song at camp and introduced it to me when we were dating in college. We had no idea it was a book though until we had our daughter and after she turned 2 I stumbled onto it on Amazon. As soon as I saw it, I bought it and had it shipped to my wife and daughter while they were on an extended visit with her parents. They were all delighted. My wife read the book with great nostalgia, and through it, has passed this cherished family tradition onto our now 3 year old daughter who has adopted the book as one of her favorites. It would not surprise me if one day, many years from now, our daughter finds this book in a dusty chest, and reads it with similar nostalgia to her own kids. That is the kind of book this is, one that will surely become a family treasure and keepsake.     Just one note on the story itself. I agree with the other reviewers that it is full of excitement and adventure, but I would be hesitant to say it's scary. It could certainly be so for some kids, so parents take care and exercise your own common sense and caution, but my daughter has loved the book and never been frightened by it since she started having it read to her when she was about 24 months old. Otherwise, I agree with the other reviewers in every way. The rhyme, the pictures, the sound effects, everything about this book  just comes together magically and wonderfully. I highly recommend it.
0439023513|3.0|The first book in the trilogy was absolutely PERFECT. I couldn't wait for the second book to be published. The second book was good (not perfect) and, once again, i couldn't wait for the big finale. I was waiting for my copy to come in the mail that I had ordered almost a year in advance and started reading it immediately! I just couldn't wait to see Katniss bring down the Capital and President Snow! Will she choose Peeta or Gale? So many questions that were finally going to be answered. WRONG!!!<br /><br />I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am with Suzanne Collins. First, you give us this awesome female character with conviction and perseverance, and then you completely deflate her in the end. Shame on you! To think that I was under the impression that Collins was a writer who could show young women to be brave and stand up for what they believe in is embarrasing!!!<br /><br />For those of you (like i was) who are looking forward to seeing Katniss as a great heroine against the Capital, think again. What you will find is a diminished woman who now resembles Haymitch...
B003L7DK6U|4.0|I have seen this film many times on DVD. I think it is a good film with good fight scenes. I think the character named Williams is good.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4/5<br /><br />I think this Blu-ray is an improvement over the DVD. I think the it looks good. I think the colours and such looks very nice, compared to my DVD.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 3/5<br /><br />Cheap and lazy Warner Bros didn`t even make a lossless 5.1 audio track. We only got the standard, and high compressed lossy version from the previous DVD. If it was up to me,  it would be mandatory to have every BD that is released to have a lossless audio track. It does sadly not work like that, as you can see.<br /><br />I think this film would`ve sounded better if we got a lossless audio instead of the common lossy one. The DD 5.1 sounds just ok in my opinion. It lacks good bass from most the punches and kicks.<br /><br />Film: 4/5<br />Overall: 4/5
B003XX2PPO|5.0|Luis Miguel regresa  Con su nuevo materal LM(Luis Miguel), El material consiste de temas románticos usando la balada, pop y jazz como estilo en sus canciones. Para todos los que añoraban que Luis Miguel volviera a sus rutas de los 90 este disco es para ustedes. Todos los temas son alegres y llenos energía  al puro estilo de el sol de méxico, el primer sencillo Labios de miel es una de los temas Pop junto con mujer de fuego, es por ti, tal vez me mientes y ella es así, las baladas consisten No existen límites, de quien es usted y lo que queda de mi escritas por el maestro Armando Manzanero. Mi tema favorito fue Siento, siento es un tema romántico pero con un estilo diferente no es tu típica canción de Luis Miguel, un jazz calmado con mezcla de R&B. Siento fue un gran cambio para Luis Miguel me recordo al material Nada es igual El disco es un gran regreso al pop de este gran artista , lo único negativo del material es su duración en lo personal se me hizo muy corto , la razon más probable  una edición especial para el 2011. Muy recomendable.    5/5  9.5  95/100  *****
B000MTDRKE|1.0|Musically I think Morse is brilliant, though I like the music on this album less than the \\"One\\" CD.  However, I give this album one star for the message itself, or rather the inconsistency of the message.  While Morse claims to be a Christian buyers should be aware that actually he is an Arian.  That is, he explicitly denies the deity of Jesus Christ - which is of course a core teaching of the New Testament and an essential doctrine of true Christianity.  The denial of the divinity of Christ can be found in his comments here: [...]    This is not a nitpicky detail.  It goes to the center of Christian faith. It is ironic that Morse urges us to go the Bible alone as our source of truth, but he fails to listen to its testimony on the most critical issue that it teaches.  It is quite disingenious to hold Martin Luther up as a model for faith in that light.  Luther would have been appalled at be associated with arianism, a doctrine that was rightfully condemned as heretical when it emerged in the life of the early church.
B003UYUR0G|3.0|.<br /><br />\\"We have no obligation to make history.<br />We have no obligation to make art.<br />We have no obligation to make a statement.<br />Our obligation is to make money.\\"<br />-Don Simpson, longtime partner of Jerry Bruckheimer.<br /><br />Is Jerry Bruckheimer your filmmaking hero? Do you love colorful action scenes where the hero's hair looks like he just came from the stylist two seconds ago...even after a five-minute sword fight? Do you not mind insipid dialogue matched with wooden acting? Does a movie based on a video game sound like high quality cinematic genius? Well, Prince Of Persia awaits!<br /><br />This is by far the worst acting I've seen out of Gyllenhall, whom I normally enjoy. Maybe the script was just so hackneyed that he gave up before he even started, and spent all his time on bicep curls. He's clearly more into looking good than acting well here, and only Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley (!...?...$) deliver anything approaching an enjoyable performance. I'm all for mindless summer fare, but when a movie is based on a video game and the video game delivers more dramatic cohesion, it's a bad sign.<br /><br />The parkour stunts are nowhere near as much fun as they could have been, and despite the obvious mega-millions spent on sets and cgi, they could have spent more time making the actors look real instead of fresh from the makeup trailer. The props etc are wonderful, but everybody looks so made-up and Hollywood that it all just never gels.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is good but all that does is highlight the cheesy make-up everyone has on in every scene. Not to mention Jake's and the Princess' hairdos. Their hair is the true star here. If only the dialogue had been given as much attention. For all the wonderful Moroccan scenery, POP still looks like an over-budgeted Hollywood Blockbuster TM, every step of the way.<br /><br />Don Simpson would be so proud.<br /><br />I'd rather watch the original Sinbad films in all their glorious hokeyness than this passable but ultimately mediocre tripe, any day.<br />Get the video games; they offer much more fun for your entertainment dollar.Get the video games; they offer much more fun for your entertainment dollar.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|I am amazed at the amount of negative reviews for this album. I had to laugh at the amount of people claiming that they have been Linkin Park fans since when they first came out... you're talking about a band that, before today, had a body of work consisting of three albums of original material. Let's face it, this isn't like AC/DC all of the sudden released a concept album. Linkin Park has shown growth and progression as a band since their first release. Meteora was basically an extension of Hybrid Theory, but there were some elements on that album that showed that Linkin Park was not going to stay in the same place. Minutes to Midnight showed a lot of growth from the band. Although a lot of people were not ready for that change, I think it is their best album, and it is a perfect middle ground between the first two albums and the new one.<br /><br />I enjoy hearing a band mature and change from album to album. Sometimes the fans follow, and sometimes they don't. Unfortunately, from reading the reviews here, it looks like a lot of fans aren't ready for change. Here's the main point: If you want Linkin Park to keep releasing Hybrid Theory and Meteora over and over again, then just listen to those albums over and over again. The band has grown and moved on from that sound, it's too bad you haven't. Go listen to Godsmack and Nickelback and quit complaining that Linkin Park doesn't sound the same.<br /><br />For anyone that enjoyed Minutes To Midnight and was intrigued about the change in direction that was present on that album and has an open mind about music, I recommend giving this album a listen. A Thousand Suns is definitely not for everyone, but someone who appreciates music as creative expression and not just as noise created out of anger should enjoy it. I honestly do not see myself listing this album as one of my favorite albums of all time by any means, and at the moment, I would still put MtM above this one (though it could grow on me), but I do definitely enjoy A Thousand Suns. The album sounds like a cohesive unit from beginning to end. It flows as a complete body of work, not just a collection of songs.<br /><br />I don't know if I can pick out any big radio hits on this album, but I'm pretty sure they didn't write it with radio in mind. Anyone who has the patience to actually sit down and listen to an entire album (not just picking out their favorite songs) can enjoy this. ...and yes, I am a \\"long time\\" Linkin Park fan.<br /><br />-----<br />UPDATE<br />-----<br /><br />After listening to this album for a couple years now, I wanted to revisit this review. The album has grown on me with each listen, and I would now regard it as my favorite album of theirs. It is amazing how much thought and passion went into this album, and you can hear that inspiration in each note.

B001BPQT8A|5.0|I found this movie to be brilliant on several levels.  First I didn't know the plot prior to seeing the movie.  See the review of the blu ray at HDdigest for specs on blu ray. Hope the blu ray lives up to its review.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Great movie in my opinion.  The twist ending was a big surprise and the movie was tense, scary, and suspensful. ;)
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Robert Plant has delivered yet again.  Starting with the Dreamland album back in 2002, Robert has been on a roll.  The Mighty Rearranger, Raising Sand, and now Band of Joy have all been amazing releases.  While some people will always compare his solo albums to Zeppelin, it is unrealistic to expect that a man over 60 will sing like one who is in his 20's.   Robert does not need to try and sound like someone he isn't to still be a great vocalist with plenty of emotion.   His selection of material and arrangement of songs with Buddy Miller has provided an album of material that you can continue to listen to again and again.  The melodies and instrumentation continue to reveal more to enjoy after repeated listens and this is a hallmark of a great album.      Buddy Miller's guitar along with Darryl Scott's banjo and pedal steel are amazing.   Patty Griffin's accompanying vocals add a beautiful layer to Robert's signature vocals.  I was at first disappointed to hear that the 2nd album with Alison Kraus was abandoned, but after having listened to Band of Joy for a week now, I can easily say that this is my album of the year.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I ama huge fan of Linkin Park, although I really did not like there first album it was to hard and Mike S sounded really bad and to over the top. Minutes To Midnight and A Thousand Suns are EPIC and I mean it. I am totally into the fact that they have slowed way down and Mike S sounds so much more relaxed and I love what he raps about today. Chester has an amazing voice on this album and I am glad to see they use his vocals more than Mike. This album I give 5 stars because it's crafted so well and let me tell you this is an album made for SubWoofers out there the bass is so smooth and it hit's home with me. I just went to Target and this couple asked me who I was playing and I said Linkin Parks new album A Thousand Suns immediately they reacted and said \\"that's Linkin Park\\"? They loved it, so please go pick this one up I know when it comes out on vinyl in September I am there to purchase it 180 grams of pure bliss!
B003JTHESA|2.0|Steve Harris is still living in his bubble. And he couldn't care less for other people's opinions, since his band has survived all this time, while a lot of his pals did not, or at least had not even a gram of the continued success of the band (however, how they survived things like \\"VIRTUAL XI\\" is a mystery...).<br /><br />So, we have all the common rules of the \\"getting Bruce and Adrian back\\" phase. Production is close to obnoxious, courtesy, of course, of Steve Harris. Probably, Kevin Shirley only handles the knobs the way Steve orders him to. Guitars lack fire, drum sounding is flat and lifeless (although NIcko is really playing good).<br /><br />Also, in this new record, there's a new \\"trick\\": The first minutes of the first track seem to have been designed only to annoy. Seldom have I heard such obnoxious intro to a song (if you can call it a intro, due to its lenght). If you still survive this minutes, some of the worst in the history of Maiden, you're in for a fairly average album.<br /><br />Even Bruce losing it. A lot of times he seems to be screaming, because he's clearly singing out of his range. This once potent and amrvellous voice is becoming annoying. Gers, as always, is superfluous. A great buddy, no doubt.<br /><br />And the song lenghts... much of them long just for the sake of being long, chorus repeated indefinitely. The album could easily have had 50 minutes, instead of boring 74 minutes.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|In this day of TMZ, American Idol and constant tabloid pablum, it is refreshing to find a book like this. Yes, the author does spend time telling us about the personalities behind the four Beatles, but these observations are (almost) always in the context of the music they created and the times in which they lived. In that sense, this book is decidedly not about the people, but the music they created as gifted, flawed human beings. I really enjoyed reading about the sheer amount of effort and groundbreaking the Beatles and their studio crews had to undertake the make the sounds we've loved for almost 50 years.

Great scientists and Hawking is arguably the greatest living scientist of our time, should not try to disprove God's existence. Hawking does not. This book is the first to take ordinary laymen into the world of quantum psysics and not totally confuse. How many universes are there? If this intrigues you read this book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is the first time I've seen the \\"Amazon Basics\\" label but this bag looked identical to the Canon backpack except it is one solid color vs the 2 colors of the Canon bag. I am extremely pleased. A friend of mine has the Canon backback and I was able to get the same thing functionally with the same quality build for about $20 less than he paid for his - and mine is a solid black which makes it look different from the rest who are running around with identical backpacks!<br />One thing I did discover is that in the front zipper area I can even pack my 12 inch Dell tablet PC!

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is a joy to watch.  It is a captivating saga of people choosing to take up the quest to battle evil despite all the obstacles they must face and the normalcy they must give up.  The first screenshot of the first episode had me hooked.  It seemed like an Elven scene straight out of Lord of the Rings.  The show continues in a parallel path to the journey made in Lord of the Rings.  The growing relationships between the main characters are delightful and encouraging.  The way they stand by each other's sides no matter how difficult it may be is something that more people in our society today should do.  The action is predictable--look for a fight scene in nearly every episode around minute 36, but this does not take away any of the adventure.  Kahlan's grace, strength, and compassion make her an excellent model for young girls.  Richard's honor, dignity, and loyalty make him a superb model for young boys.  The way they respect each other is something you don't see on television shows very often.  I suppose a huge part of the appeal of the show to me is that it shows functional relationships based on loyalty, love, and selflessness.  Television today is saturated with shows glorifying bad decision making, peer pressure, and selling sexuality to audiences already inundated with such images.  It is refreshing to immerse yourself in a show that takes you back to the honorable basics: battle evil where you find it, be loyal to your loved ones, and never give up hope.  Now those are lessons the youth of America need to see modeled in their television programming!
B002NXSRVG|2.0|I have to say I was simply fascinated watching \\"GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\". Not because it was a good movie, or because it was innovative or original. \\"GI Joe\\" is simply amazing in that it fails at almost everything it tries to deliver.<br /><br />Action - I will give the movie a couple stars here, there are plenty of action scenes with things blowing up and bullets (and funky looking electricy blobs too) being shot almost constantly. Throw in some techno-matrix-karate fighting and a couple \\"Iron Man\\"-like super suits and you'll be distracted for a few minutes.<br /><br />Plot - Are you kidding? I love the idea of a metal-eating \\"virus\\" and the visual of seeing it hit the Eiffel Tower was pretty cool, but the mish-mash of a soldier feeling he let down the girl he loved, haunted by a failed mission..blah, blah, blah. We've seen it all before and it's a pretty thin stretch to make this the backbone of your film(this same plot device is actually the basis for the comedy \\"Airplane!\\"). At one point our hero shows up at a funeral in a thunderstorm...on a motorcycle...wearing sunglasses. Okay, I have an easier time buying the bionic super-suit and the Borg-like bad-guy than I do believing anyone would think its a good idea to go for a motorcycle ride in a driving rain wearing sunglasses, arriving while the funeral is in progress just so you can look all melancholy and cool.<br /><br />Special Effects - The big F/X moments in the flick actually pay off. The underwater villain's lair, the metal eating munchies going after the tanks and the tower look great. Unfortunately not as much attention seemed to be paid to the \\"little\\" things, like the CGI chase scenes where everything looked too cartoonish and simply silly.<br /><br />Cast - I'm convinced there were no actual humans in this film. Not one person \\"acted\\", they simply walked around looking good in several costumes, kind of like ninja-models-on-the-loose. You have to worry when the one character who doesn't utter a word the entire film and is hidden behind a mask actually manages to out-act everyone around him. Quite a menagerie of cliches too; the witty black side-kick who provides the comic relief (kept waiting for him to say \\"dayyyummm\\"), the drone like henchman, the Asian karate expert, the fat karate master. The \\"Real American Hero\\" thing is gone as well, now \\"GI Joe\\" is made up of soldiers from aound the globe...which is fine...except that the film basically focuses on only the American \\"GI Joe\\" characters...and the only \\"foreigners\\" are the bad guys.<br /><br />I know, I know, people are going to say..\\"what did you expect from a movie made out of a toy, and based on an 80's cartoon?\\". I simply have to say that I expected more than this. I never liked \\"The Transformers\\" cartoon (I was more of a Gobots kids myself) but I enjoyed the first film.<br /><br />Like \\"Van Helsing\\" and \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" & \\"The Hulk\\", \\"GI Joe\\" seems to mis-fire on most aspects and will be forgotten by the time the \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" finishes rolling during the closing credits.ehind a mask actually manages to out-act everyone around him.

B002ZG9968|1.0|This was the longest two hours of my life. It was boring and predictable, it had a made for television feel to it, aside from the completely awful birth scene which would have never been shown on TV. If you really want to watch this film, I would suggest to borrow or rent as you may find that it is not worth the money to buy it.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|So shoot me if I am a fan.  Seen virtually every Zep, Plant show in Cal since 1971.  Bottom line is RP is still amazing after 40+ years.  Hard to say what is best on this cd - there's a little something for everyone:  Led Zep III, echos of Strange Sensation, Raising Sand - but in the end its again something different he's come up with and its something very, very good.   Having said this, I think Angel Dance may be the weakest track on the cd - Los Lobos is so good its almost pointless to cover this song.  Similarly with the next track - House of Cards - because Richard Thompson is also excellent and so original!  Hard to top the originals.....So, the cd starts out a bit average for the first two songs.  But then, it suddenly takes off and the listener is off to Band of Joy Land - the rest of the cd is SO DARN GOOD!  There are just so many great tracks here.  Hopefully listeners will go out and buy more Buddy Miller and Patty Griffin cds, because they are incredible talents on their own.   For Robert Plant fans, this cd has got to be a real treat. Just amazing what RP has done to stay relevant for so long.  Hope all you other casual listeners also enjoy!
0446569895|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! You get insight as to how Ozzy grew up, got into music, and struggled through the early years playing blues covers. He takes you through the rise and fall of the Black Sabbath days, his solo career and relationship with Randy Rhodes, all of the albums that followed, and his MTV show \\"The Osbournes.\\" His stories are HILARIOUS! I couldn't stop laughing. He is brutally open and honest about his drug and alcohol use, struggles with depression, and various relationships with women. Whether or not you're a fan of his music, this is an easy to read, well written book that I couldn't put down. Highly recommended!
0812550757|4.0|This could/should have been a completely different book from Ender's Game.  I enjoyed it quite a bit save for all the crying.  There was not that much religious over tones and not that much Portuguese as some other reviews led me to believe.  The last fifty pages or so dragged on and on costing this book the fifth star rating.    I recommend this book as long as you are not expecting more of Ender's Game.

I am the lucky one to have been able to read it, honestly in this day and age it is so nice to read a good book..Nicholas Sparks has a way of drawing you in with his characture development...I was cheering at the end....I was sad it was over and I am currently looking forward to his next book..Thank you Mr. Sparks..
B000V4UFZK|4.0|When I saw Poltergeist (1982) in the theater back in '82, I really liked it.  It really was unlike anything I had ever seen before in the horror genre.  It stuck with me for a long time.  I used to watch it all the time when it was playing on any cable TV movie channel.  I hadn't yet seen any of the classic haunted house/ghost story movies, such as House On Haunted Hill (1959), The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), The Legend Of Hell House (1973), Burnt Offerings (1976), The Amityville Horror (1979), The Changeling (1980), etc.  I was just a kid back in '82, so Poltergeist was really the first haunted house movie I had seen.<br /><br />These days, while I still like Poltergeist, I don't rank it in my Top 10 haunted house movies of all time simply because the above mentioned movies are far superior, in my opinion.  Not that Poltergeist is weak, it isn't.  But I would classify Poltergeist as a haunted house movie that's pretty much suitable for the whole family to watch.  It has that Stephen Spielberg family-friendly \\"children's charm\\" feel to it.  You know what I mean - a middle class couple that lives in a nice new house in a nice new subdivision and they have some small children and a dog.  These things alone lighten the mood right off the bat.  I know I should judge this movie on its own merits, but I have grown, over time, to prefer the more serious haunted house/ghost story movies that have a dark atmosphere from start to finish and usually take place in an old mansion, like most of the movies I mentioned above.  So, as a result, when I watch Poltergeist THESE DAYS, it doesn't quite satisfy my craving for really dark atmosphere and seriousness like the other movies do.  Back in '82 I would have given this movie 5 stars.  These days, it's 4 stars.  It's a good movie, but it's too much on the lighter side for me.  I prefer psychological horror that the previously mentioned movies provide over the in-your-face and over-the-top horror of Poltergeist.<br /><br />I must say the movie gets darker and creepier as it progresses, which is good.  Some of the scenes are scary, some of the scenes are over-the-top (that's an understatement), while other scenes are meant to be humorous, while still other scenes come off as cheesy.  In this movie, you'll actually SEE the ghosts.  For this kind of family-oriented movie, it's totally reasonable and acceptable.<br /><br />I really like the clown doll in the son's bedroom.  Creeeeeeppppppyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The score by Jerry Goldsmith is adequate for this movie in that it fits in with the whole family-friendly/charming feel to the movie.  By no means is it scary music.  No way.  If you want scary and creepy music in a haunted house movie, watch the original The Haunting (1963) with its score by Humphrey Searle.  It fits perfectly into the dark and creepy atmosphere.  Another movie with a great score is The Changeling (1980).  Also, The Legend Of Hell House (1973), The Amityville Horror (1979), and Rose Red (2002) have great scores.  Even The Innocents (1961) has its moments of great music.  Stephen Spielberg co-wrote and co-produced Poltergeist while Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Salem's Lot, The Funhouse) directed it.<br /><br />The plot:  Some ghosts begin communicating with Mr. & Mrs. Freeling's five-year-old daughter Carol Anne through the \\"snow\\" on the TV set in the wee hours of the morning.  This is the way the ghosts get into the Freeling's California home.  The ghosts kidnap Carol Anne and her family makes a great effort to rescue her, much to the ghosts' displeasure.  Do they succeed?<br /><br />This DVD has some good special features, one of which is a documentary called They Are Here: The Real World Of Poltergeists Revealed in 2 parts: 1) Science Of The Spirits, and 2) Communing With The Dead.<br /><br />Overall, a solid movie that you should like if you're into haunted house movies and/or haunted house movies that are more family-friendly and over-the-top.-top.
0553805371|3.0|I just recently finished reading my third Hawking book \\"The Grand Design\\", but first about the book itself. It is excellent quality, sturdy, hard-bound. Fortunately there's a lot of room for notes and comments, (I don't think I annotated any book as much as this one. There's a few empty pages between some chapters that are now filled.) Interestingly, many do believe if you give enough monkeys enough time, they could, by chance, type out the works of Shakespeare. With the best of highly educated scientists coupled with (presumptuously) professional proof-readers and finally computer spell checking, he still has at least one type-o in his book. Good quality 4-color pages and very easy on the eyes to read.    As for the content, a briefer summary of science and some religious views through-out mankind's history as his \\"Brief History of Time\\". An elegant and concise reading on quantum and M theories. I must say most of what is in there I am already very familiar with, but it too, was all laid out very nicely and concisely.    Paradoxly, Hawking writing \\"Philosophy is dead\\" is a philosophical statement. His seriously questioning whether a table in another room still might be there when you leave, also shows philosophy isn't dead. I'm confident time will easily prove him wrong here.     Hawking speculates at the beginning of the big bang multiple universes were formed with varying laws of physics. Our universe is merely one of many that just so happens, by chance, to have these \\"laws\\" exactly right for life to occur. Since, now, we have odds for this to happen, we can no longer claim exclusively God created our universe specifically for us. He offers no scientific proof that these laws, (gravity, weak and strong nuclear forces and electromagnetic force) can even be variable, it's a shame he didn't.    And as he says, this 'still doesn't prove there is no God', this theory only implies that nature has an astronomically improbable chance to do it on its own, adding even onemore to the many astronomically improbable chances in the process of the theory of evolution. Although, now the contrary also becomes an additional consideration; Instead of less need for God, there is now more of a need. Since the odds of having a universe with \\"perfect\\" laws now proves to be most increasingly unlikely, there is equally, a need for Someone to make sure at least one of the many innumerable universes has the astronomically unlikely \\"happenstance\\" of perfectly balanced, steady and reliable laws.    The book is quite short, and proposes or leaves many questions unanswered. Hawking doesn't discuss whether or not it's been scientifically proven that the four forces can vary from anything other than what they are, or whether the Big Bang is a cycle that repeats itself. This would also allow chance opportunities for the perfect universe to blast itself into existence, a theory, I believe, is simply way to preposterous to happen given any number of universes, chances and time. Professor Hawking doesn't propose or calculate any mathematical odds, as even Richard Dawkins and Carl Sagan do. Nor does he explain what it might be like at the \\"boundaries\\" where two different universes with different physical laws meet. There certainly has to be \\"clashing\\" of some sort.    He does show how binary stars couldn't have planets that support life, just as planets that have elliptical orbits. I'm aware that more than half of the stars in our universe are at least binary. Professor Hawking doesn't attempt at what percentage of planets may be too elliptical. These are things worthy to know and that need to be considered, especially when one discusses Drake's equation.    Ultimately, other than a handful of \\"trivia bits\\" \\"The Grand Universe\\" doesn't really offer much new, especially factual, nor as much as his other books have. But it is an interesting summary of what is already out there that most people keeping up with things may already know. The book is a nice packageof recent theories all wrapped up in one. Still worth the read, but certainly his weakest book.
055358894X|4.0|A great series with good character development.  The second one seemed a little flat in the first half, but picked up just fine in the second half.    Of course the last one left room for more stories... good news imho.
B003HI3MSE|5.0|First off, anyone to say this album \\"Fever\\" is no good, can't possible have good taste in music. Ive actually liked BFMV more since I bought this album. This album might not be as \\"heavy\\" as their past albums in some peoples opinions, but to me it is just as heavy, and it is a more polished with perfectly written lyrics and music, mainly the music. From start to finish this album rocks even with the lighter songs on the album, which start out accousticly and end up rocking through the chourus with loud guitars.  \\"Your Betrayal\\" is one of the best over all rock songs I've ever heard, and its intro is badass, so good i think it's better than Metallicas' \\"Enter Sandman\\" intro. I know a lot of people will argue that opinion with me, but thats ok, we are all entitled to our opinions.
B0033DOIHC|5.0|This book was great!  I've read many of this type of book and this is one of the best.  I was disappointed when I finally finished the (second book) The Girl Who Played With Fire and can hardly wait for the third one (The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest) to come out.<br /><br />The main character is both entrancing and non-mainstream in more ways than only her tattoo.  I've grown to love her and the other main characters... and miss them now that I'm done with the (so far) published series.  Sadly... only one more left and then they're ended.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy this DVD set, despite the missing original soundtrack.  While the original music did add to the show, we didn't really notice it's absence.  This is not the case with all TV on DVD, as I would have never purchased [[ASIN:B002DYJ520 Ally McBeal: The Complete Series (Includes Soundtrack)]] as a gift for my wife if it didn't come with the complete music.  Even though I already owned [[ASIN:B00005S6KA Daria - Is It Fall Yet?]] it was nice to have a nearly complete collection in one box.

0440236738|5.0|I thought \\"Gone for Good\\" was one of Harlan Coben's best books so far. It is a page turner and keeps you on the edge throughout. I highly recommend this book to Harlan Coben fans and those who have never read his works. I also recommend \\"Tell No One.\\" He is a very good mystery/thriller writer. And, for those who like series with a recurring protagonist, the Myron Bolitar series has very entertaining repartee with mystery thrown in for good measure.
B002F6FQGK|4.0|I was behind on discovering Florence + The Machine.  I heard her on the VMAs and listened to the snippets on amazon so I decided to download the whole album.  It's not bad, but to me, by far, the best song is Dog Days are Over.  Personally I would just download that one song and let the rest be.  It's still a fairly decent album.  I have listened to it about three times in a row and it is starting to grow on me.
B000002AE3|4.0|After the death of Jeff Porcaro, Toto was conflicted.  They were not sure if they should continue.  They had hired Simon Phillips to fill in for Jeff for the [[ASIN:B000025OG6 Kingdom of Desire]] tour.  Luckily they decided to continue and made Simon a full Member.  They recorded with Simon and the resulting album is 1995's Tambu.         After a harder Previous album, Toto goes back to more of a mixed album, with an equal balance of ballads and rockers.  The album starts off none to promising with Gift of Faith.  A long drawn out rocker that just does not go anywhere.  Other reviewers have listed this a highlight.....I don't see it.  After that though everything is gold.  On the next track, I Will Remember, We are to treated to a thunderous drum beat by Simon Phillips.  This turns into one of Toto's Finest ballads.  With a soaring Steve Lukather vocal.  Just listen to him on the chorus.  Great stuff.        You belong to me is another Wonderful ballad.  Toto also experiments on this album, As shown with Baby he's Your Man.  Toto's first song with a hip-Hop backbeat. I Love Luke's Guitar solos on this song.  Perfect.  My favorite track is the Other End of Time.  Another great GREAT Luke/Paich ballad.  Toto had ballads in their back pocket.  There's even a fun funk tinged track here.  The Turning Point is a fast paced sing a long track with some really great funky Guitar licks and great drumming from Simon Phillips.          Looking for a rocking anthem?  Look No further then Drag him to the Roof.  Great piano solo to highlight David Paich.  The album like King of Desire, has an Instrumental, Dave's Gone Skiing.  It highlights a band on fire.        This album is more varied then Kingdom of Desire.  For that I like it better.  As always, Steve Porcaro helped them in the studio even though he's not a full member anymore.       Top notch Album.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|I loved Lost, until the end, though I must say that it was the first 2 seasons that had me mesmerized.  Seasons 3 - 5 were enjoyable, but it was the original magic that continued to fuel my enthusiasm for the series.  That, and the anticipation that \\"mysteries revealed\\" would cause me, at some future date, to watch the series again, and that I'd enjoy understanding details from the perspective of one who had already made the journey.  No need for that now (horrendous ending), & that's a disappointment.<br /><br />One question, though, for anyone who cares to answer.  Something that I puzzled over as I watched the show was why so many characters had the names of political philosophers:  Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Bentham [I can't even remember which character Bentham was, but there was a Bentham on the show, right?]  Anyway, I kept thinking that at the end we'd see that somehow these characters, and the role they played on Lost, had some connection to the thinkers whose names they were given, but I feel pretty certain that this was just pretentious b.s. on the part of the writers.  The Christian symbolism at the end seems to be at odds with the whole \\"political philosophy theme\\" which was suggested by the characters' names. \\"Christian Shepherd\\" is a name of significance (subtle stuff, guys!!!), while the philosophy stuff, like so much else, seems to have been no more than something to get our minds whirring, with no ultimate significance for the story.  Does anyone know whether the writers ever addressed this?  I haven't seen it mentioned in any of the comments here (not that I've read all of them), & thought I might ask.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILERS  After waiting months for the final installation of probably my favorite series I am left with a huge feeling of disappointment.  I loved book one and two and I just knew that book three would be the best of them all. But as I read this book I kept wondering who these characters were.  Where was the strong Katniss from book one and two?  The one who fought and won in a fight to the death?  In this book she comes across as weak and fragile.  She is constantly needing medical attention or is off crying somewhere.  She was tough as nails before.  And what happened to Peeta?  Katniss and Peeta's relationship was so bizarre in this book.  I know I read in couple other reviews the frustration with the ending.  Prim dying, Gale's future after the war mentioned as a brief after thought and even Katniss ad Peeta's life together in the end was unsatisfying.  The whole thing that started off this series was Katniss saving her sister from certain death by taking her place in The Hunger Games and then Prim dies in the end anyway!  What a waste.  I know that many say that the reason a lot of the reviews are so low is because we wanted that fairy tale ending where everything ended perfectly.  But I don't agree.  This whole series revolves around a bloody and sad life that these districts had to live through.  I really didn't see a perfect ending.  But I did hope that all of Katniss' struggles would not be in vain.  That her sacrifice for Prim and the sacrifices made by the other tributes in the second book would have meant something.  All it lead to was a big, bloody war that even when it ended left the people still in almost as bad a shape as before.  Another reviewer stated Katniss seemed empty at the end of the book.  That is exactly true!  yeah, she married Peeta and the had children but she doesn't seem happy at all.  I wish that I had stopped at book two and drawn my own conclusions as to the ending.  The only reason this is a two star instead of a one star is on the merits of the first two books.  I don't really have any positives for this book.  I will say that if you have been letting your teenager read these books and thought they were bloody or depressing in the first two, this book is much worse.  Be prepared for some pretty descriptive war scenes and overall despair.  If you are looking for a satisfying ending to a stellar series, don't look here.
031606792X|4.0|I loved this book as well as the first three however, after reading some other reviews...I understand their disappointment. They're right about the love scene. I'm a Twi-mom and although I understand the general audience to be teens...Meyer could have given us older gals a bit more beef! Something more than fade to black. I read and re-read that Bella just goes into the ocean and now..it's morning. WHAT!? NO! I couldn't believe it really but I pressed on and did enjoy the rest of the book. Some of the other critics are right on with other points as well. Like, the absence of Renee mostly and Charlie not wanting to know much..he's a sheriff! Kinda hard to swallow that one. Sheriffs' ALWAYS wanna KNOW don't they? In the end though, I love Stephenie Meyers previous work so much and she's created such a nice fantasy for me that I can't bash too harshly.
1931955085|5.0|A beautiful book, full of Ryden's flawless paintings. I don't have anything relevant to say about his art, besides it is wonderful. Sometimes it creeps me out a little but I can't deny it's perfectly executated and so mysterious. I love all the symbolism that is present. And as an artist myself, I find it truly inspiring.  I just wish there were less blank spaces, and more and bigger pictures (there are full-two-pages pictures, but some have a huge white frame on the page)...    And I just found it strange that there is a loose paper sheet inside, a photograph paper, but blank. Left me thinking if it was supposed to be a print... but it was blank. Couldn't find information about that. If someone knows, I'd like to know.

0375507256|5.0|Wow!    David Mitchell has written an incredible book, full of  rhythmic surprises and unexpected delight. With its cosmic themes of humankind's death and rebirth, he has aimed high on the ambition meter, and largely succeeded. In many ways it is a tour de force, achingly funny, thick with description and wit.I am still chuckling and considering and shuddering a week after completing it.    The title derives from a monumental musical opus that is being written by a lovable cad, (in a book with a lot of lovable cads) one of Mitchell's strongest character studies. A work in six parts, the score is arranged to have interrelated movements, evoking atmospheric variations within a united theme. Mitchell uses this structure for the book itself, and his writing, so alive and unforgettable, is also wondrously musical, so that we \\"hear\\" with our eyes, not our ears. The \\"movements\\", which in this case, are short, circumscribed memoirs penned by different authors, take place in disparate centuries, all over the globe. If the reader is anything like me, in the opening chapters, one struggles to find the common thread, thumbing backward, hoping to connect the odd \\"dots\\", before finally succumbing, (with a happy sigh) to let go of anticipated imaginings and let Mitchell take us where we will. He certainly commands the orchestration. He writes with a baton, not a pen!    What if the world, our world, our civilization, continually rose and fell because we were compelled toward the kind of grasping progress we seemed predisposed to, and incapable of ever conquering our basest impulses to conquer and enslave? Mitchell's goal is to explicate this for us, and he does it without wasting a word, in a book with many beautifully employed words.     Melville never stood on Nantucket until after Moby Dick was published, and one wonders, how on earth did he ever imagine such a time and place and make it so monumental and convincing? David Mitchell has the same kind of perfected imaginative gravure and this book is a Moby Dick for our generation, faced as we are with the greatest of challenges regarding the future of our species and our planet.
0815411839|5.0|By far the best biography on Monroe ever written, with the author having no ax to grind against its subject. I find some male authors on Monroe disliking her based on what I think is disapproval of her interactions with men through out her life. I feel her sexuality is threatening to many straight men, I particularly noticed this with Anthony Summers in The Goddess. This book is incredible on many levels, but the area it outshines all others is the likely cause of her death. Spoto accurately writes that she had a one night stand with President Kennedy (and thats it). She wanted more I believe and Im guessing that her ego took a huge  blow when she couldnt develop that contact into something much more. On a personal level, internally, I believe this added greatly to her depression the final summer. Throughout her life what Marilyn Monroe wanted Marilyn Monroe got. President Kennedy wasnt going to happen for her.<br /><br /> As to Robert Kennedy, she told her close friend Ralph Roberts that the rumors about Bobby Kennedy werent true, and I believe her, she describes him as puny.Truman Capote commented in print on  rumors about Robert Kennedy s anatomy with...... Im surprised he was able to father 13 children...........referring to a certain part of Bobby s anatomy that was apparently also puny........Distasteful to comment on, probably,but with Marilyns track record with Sinatra and  Dimaggio, etc, that obscure detail may be carry a lot of weight and I would be very surprised if she would have been invoved with him for that reason alone.<br /><br />As to supposed press conferences she would have called, had she not died, to reveal her affairs with the Kennedys......  never would have happened in a million years...........Marilyn Monroe was the bigest star in the world and she wanted to remain the biggest.....no way would she EVER have done that!<br /><br />As to the actual death, Spoto tries to detail for the reader the medical/scientific facts and the science around the autopsy. The discoloration of the colon in the autopsy simply cant be overlooked. The absence of pill residue...........the drug levels were huge and enema seems probable. Murray and Greenson were the ones on the scene that nite and I believe an incorrect final dose thru enema was the culprit. Marilyn contributed to this horrible situation by taking nembutal thru out the day and I believe poor medical supervison combined with Marilyn s carelessness created the fatal cocktail. It really is too bad more time and attention at the time of death did not investigate the circumstances more carefully, lousy police work. At the very least Greenson should have lost his medical license if found negligent..........Excellent book, a must read..............oloration of the colon in the autopsy simply cant be overlooked.

B003UYUR10|3.0|I will have to do a mixed review on this one. I went to the store and there were 3 versions. One is the DVD only. One is the Bluray DVD only and one is the Bluray, DVD and digital copy. It is not worth the extra $$ to buy the 3pack unless you are dead set on having your digital copy.<br />The special features were definately not worth the money spent. Also, the special feature on the Bluray has the Rewind/Fast Forward disabled so you HAVE to watch the whole thing from start to finish. If you miss something, you have to start back from start and cannot FFWD. They are also very limited as stated in the product description. You HAVE to have both the Bluray and the DVD to see all the extras and there are only 3 to see.<br />If you are a fan of the Assassin's Creed game and the amazing views from rooftops, this movie quickly takes advantage of this photography style and I felt that they sort of \\"stole\\" from Assassin's Creed.<br />The plot: Wasn't bad. It was a story of family betrayal and brotherly faith. It showed that the main character could have ruled by the way he is able to gain and manage followers from different lifestyles. The action was pretty good such as the wall walking and special effects.<br />So..It's not a poorly made movie. It's just not worth the money for the limited and restricted special features. I suggest renting it unless you require the digital copy.
0811876373|4.0|the book itself is very cute. it has nice pictures, which i like.  instructions seem very comprehensive.  some directions are repeated many times throughout the book, which i guess is good if you don't want to go hunting down a specific tip.  note, you do need some specialized stuff to make some of these. you need a specific cookie cutter for a few of the cake pops. you need candy sticks and you need styrofoam to hold your pops.  the author does tell you if they think a specific idea will not travel well (such as the witch pops). i did appreciate this as it would stink to go through the trouble of making them only to have them come apart in transport. the author also suggests only making 1/4 of the recipe for beginners.  i think this is a good idea. you won't get overwhelmed. plus cake freezes so you can always do more pops at a later date.<br /><br />so i tried the pumpkin pops for a halloween party.  i had nothing but difficulties with these. specifically, the problem being getting them to stay on the stick.  no matter what, the cake balls just wanted to slide right through.  the second problem was the candy melts never got thin enough to make a smooth dip.  i tried the recommendations to fix this - but it really didn't work.  in all i got 6 that stayed on the sticks.  the rest i just made into a pumpkin patch, sans stick.  i will try again.
0439023513|5.0|This series (and especially this book) brings the reader on an emotional roller coaster. This is one of the few books that has actually made me teary-eyed!    I appreciate the fact that Suzanne Collins is realistic--nothing is easy or without consequence. I highly recommend this series!
B003FSTN5C|3.0|The structure of the NCIS LA team is hampered by the fact that there is no strong central authority figure, like Gibbs is in the D.C. NCIS office.  It all looks like a bunch of twenty-somethings running around trying to be cool, and that, coupled with some fairly boring, second-rate script writing makes for a mediocre series. LL Cool J is the most interesting character in this unremarkable, formulaic series, but even he can't save it from being so predictable and unimaginative.  The gee-whiz technical stuff works so much better in the regular NCIS series, due to the splendid character portrayals by \\"McGee\\" and \\"Abby\\", so really, what has NCIS LA got to recommend it, week after week?  Oh, it's not horrible, but just about anything else is a better use of my time.    My feeling about the D. C. NCIS is totally different -- I own the DVDs of all seven seasons of it and anxiously await the rollout of season eight.

0380725398|5.0|\\"Jamaica Inn\\", Daphne du Maurier's classic 1935 novel of suspense and romance, holds up surprisingly well as an entertaining read.  Set in the author's rugged and half wild native Cornwall, the brooding Bodmin Moor is a key component of the story.<br /><br />The year is 1815.  A young woman named Mary Yellan, who has helped run a small farm with her widowed mother, is suddenly an orphan with no place to go but the home of her Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss Merlyn at the remote Jamaica Inn.  The Inn has an evil reputation, and Mary soon discovers the reason is her brutal Uncle Joss, who has intimidated Aunt Patience into snivelig subservience while engaging in a mysterious and presumably illegal enterprise.<br /><br />The plucky Mary refuses to knuckle under to Joss Merlyn; her curiosity will put her in the path of a vicious criminal gang which will threaten her with kidnapping, rape, and murder.  She will be attracted to Uncle Joss's enigmatic and handsome brother Jem and seek uncertain assistance from the mysterious albino priest Francis Davey.  The hard truths of Jamaica Inn will change her life forever.<br /><br />\\"Jamaica Inn\\" is highly recommended to fans of Daphne du Maurier, and to readers looking for a well-written period romance.
1601251505|5.0|I have been playing DND for a extremely long time, ever since the early 80s with the white, red and blue boxes yes I'm that old. So I do now some things about Rpgs. I have played Shadowrun, rifts, the first marvel super heroes, Tsr's version of Conan, TMNT, the original star trek, Pendragon DND, ADND, ADND 2nd edition etc etc. So when 3rd edition came out I was first worried, but read it through and then bought the book found it worked very good and went from having 30 pages to 40 pages of house rules to 5 pages of house rules. 3rd edition was good but found that some of the classes were lacking, for example there was no reason to go above second level in ranger or some of the feats were broken. But then the 3.5 rules came out and they fixed allot of things and I found it worked I still play the game with a Saturday game I'm in. But I found I needed something with more meat on it. Then one day I was looking up games on the Net when I came upon a game called pathfinder, at first I thought it was a game based on the Movie/book, then when I read the review and description made me interested in buying it, but the price was to much at the time. So I went to Amazon and found it a little less and within my budget.<br />The first thing I did when it came in from the mail was open the crisp new book and read and read. I was at a wow moment I could not believe what I was reading it was what I was looking for, for a long while. I know when I'm asked to run DND I run Pathfinder it works I have only 1 page of house rules and it works. To any one who buys the book you must read the whole book, yes when I thought I have gotten the jest of it, I did not and found that there was things that changed from 3.5 to pathfinder. The classes are fixed and found that I was actually wanting to play for example the Sorcerer, for which I did not like in 3rd edition and 3.5. The feats were astounding and the rules are stream lined, which it just not makes since but allot more logical. The combat rules are way better and I found that the skill section have made changes such as getting rid of redundant skills and combined then in one skill such as listen, spot, and search is one skill called perception. The gear, weapon and Armour was a wow they have color plates with the description of the gear and a picture of the gear with it.<br />What I have found was that they also put the DMG in the book too, so players and game masters can have access to it to. So no lugging around a players handbook and Dungeon masters guide, just one book. They made the prestige classes better, such as the assassin, I never understand the concept of assassins having a spell list, only prestige class I was looking for was the archmage and they did not have it. oh will that is fine. They also had a large section of magical items, weapons and armor, with beautifully done artwork for them. There is a section with terrain encounters and rules on effects such as bleeding rule etc.<br /><br />The book is hardbound with 568 pages of material for the game. The Art work is very good and enjoyable to look at. They got away from the DND artwork and made there own look and feel to the game. This is not 3.5 while they say it is compatible with 3.5 it is a 3.72 edition and should be seen as that. But with a little work one can use material from 3.5 with a little ease. The classes is a little powerful then the 3.5 but in all I found that they are done more logically and better. I found that game play runs more smoothly with the new classes and rules. In the 3.5 and earlier edition I found they were clunky and often had to look things up.<br /><br />So all in all the book is excellent and found it is even better the the new 4th edition which I have no desire to ever play after reading the rubbish in the game.rules are way better and I found that the skill section have made changes such as getting rid of redundant skills and combined then in one skill such as listen, spot, and search is one skill called perception.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|As a therapist in private practice for many years, \\"In Treatment\\" (Season One)is so authentic and true to the therapeutic encounter it is almost painful to watch.  The client issues are germane and identifiable, and the actors simply melt into their roles so effortlessly it beggars description.  Byrne is a wonder himself as he deals with his own inadequacies as a therapist, a man untrue to his own ideals, a withholding parent and an absent husband all within the context of the therapeutic sessions and beyond into his own life and work.  Diane Wiest did a particularly outstanding job of \\"helping the helper\\" gain insight into the ways treatment overlaps with his own issues, despite his protestations to the contrary. An absorbing, humorous and revelatory insider's look into the therapeutic process wherein everyone's life is changed, even the viewer's.
B0041VIJQG|4.0|Wine, women and song = Plant, Griffin and a great bunch of covers. Life's wonderful!  Great job done by all.  My personal faves: Silver Rider, Monkey, Satan - they all possess that \\"special sound\\" that only Robert Plant can conjur up with his musicianship and vocal experience. Kudos to the other bandmates that really make this album a winner as well.    Overall, a fine piece of work.  I'm saving that 4th star however for his next effort - the one where with perhaps a few cups of java, he'll really rock our socks off once again (you know he's still got it in him!!!).  Peace y'all!
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Amazing. I can't help but to feel bothered at the people who don't like change. Sorry it happens. There I said it. Since change IS GOING TO HAPPEN might as well make it good right? Linkin Park has done just that here. It's an artistic piece of work here. Straight from the beginning to end. It's not the Hybrid/Meteora stuff any longer...Sorry people, give it up already. That teenage angsty music came and left. Listen to ATS and listen to linkin evolved. Period.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The hit show Supernatural is worth it's weight in gold for the small price you will pay for the first season.  In my opinion once you start watching each episode it sort of becomes like Lay's potato chips;but this time you can't watch just one!
B00133KFGW|4.0|Loosely based on Dickins' \\"Oliver Twist,\\" Freddie Highmore plays a young boy lost in New York's childcare system, searching for his parents, who gave him up.  He runs away from the boys' home he grew up in, abused by the other kids, not the adults, who genuinely care for him.<br /><br />Highmore has a gift of music, inherited from both his parents, and is quickly picked up by a Fagan like character played by Robin Williams, who sends kids out into Washington Square Park playing music for money.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the boy's mother finds out that her son is still alive (she was lied to by her father, who forged her signature on the papers, giving him up.)  How the doctors and hospital went along with this is never explained, but the mother gives a decent performance, yelling at her father on his deathbed, \\"Where is he?\\"  She goes to see child care services, who after running her through red-tape, finally help her try to track down her missing son.<br /><br />Williams learns the state is looking for \\"Evan\\", and changes the boy's name to \\"August Rush,\\" a stage name.  The boy is quickly discovered by a priest who takes him to Juliard, and the boy is revealed to be a musical prodigy.<br /><br />The tale follows Oliver Twist; Williams reclaims the boy from the school, claiming to be his father.  In the park, Freddie meets his real father, who convinces him to go to the planned concert anyway.  There, both parents are called by their son's music, and the mother recognizes him on stage from his photograph.<br /><br />A very good modernization of Dickens.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I'm going to try to make this review short and sweet because no one wants to hear rambling from Mr. Random about this album. For those following and keeping track of Linking Park will expect brilliance from the band but what they will receive from \\"A Thousand Suns\\" will be far more than anticipated. Many will agree and disagree that this album sounds nothing like the past 3 albums but personally, I feel that the evolution of LP's last albums have led them precisely to where they are today, a band that has done it all... a band that can afford to do something off the wall and out of the box. This album is nothing like you've heard from Linkin Park before.<br />\\"ATS\\" is an album that takes you on a ride, a journey from beginning to the end and leaves you on a peaceful island wanting more.<br />It's truly an amazing album and following Mike Shinoda on his blog led me to believe it was going to be. LP let us all in on their process, in detail and I think this is one of the qualities of the band that separates them from everyone else. Speaking of which: Who seriously approved: \\"Meeting of A Thousand Suns\\" DVD? C'mon guys. I was TRULY looking forward to this as I have with every Linkin Park album (I even paid a little more for it considering it was released on that online video content website that rhyme with ZULU), turned out to be an ACID trip of an experience I will probably never forget because I almost puked myself watching it. Why not just do a simple documentary like you've always done. A video camera, a lens, a person holding it... maybe even on a tripod, shoot, edit, deliver. Simple right? No... had to go all Blair Witch and Cloverfield on us. There were several shots/scenes where there was dust all over the lens. I know it was filmed on a DSLR... but seriously! I won't let the DVD ruin my review on the album but I would just like to warn people about the included DVD. It's very unsettling :(<br />All in all, another great album from Linkin Park. Buy the album... Live Strong... Live Well.<br />Also, thanks Amazon for supplying this album and delivering it to my work desk on it's release day. Amazon! Yes! Bye... Live Well.  Also, thanks Amazon for supplying this album and delivering it to my work desk on it's release day. Amazon! Yes! Bye
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Never did I ever think Accept had a five star disc EVER! In their entire career, there were always bands better than they were in America. The lyrics were always 2nd rate and the music was catchy, bit a bit hit and miss. A 2nd tier Priest. I always liked the band and the pint sized Udo, even though his voice was an acquired taste.<br /><br />Here, all these years later, we have a CD that is 90% HIT! A couple tracks stray a little from the core sound, with the ballad like 'Time Machine', while not terrible, it kind of dips the middle of the disc down. Then 'Kill the Pain' really drags you down. Not the best ballad. Accept were never a good ballad band... and 'Shades of Death' is good, but a quirky keyboard kind of ruins it a little.<br /><br />But the Good / GREAT:<br /><br />Teutonic Terror - Excellent, Excellent track. The best on here IMO so far.<br /><br />The Abyss - Vintage Accept style and chorus, light to Heavy with a great Crunch Riff. Great Vocal performance. Fits like a glove. A slower part toward the end reminds me very much of a MSG style. Schenker influence??<br /><br />Blood of the Nations - Really good riff and core track. Vintage Accept, but fresh sounding.<br /><br />Locked and Loaded - Nice, double bass pounding Accept / T.T. Quick style. Really driving and good Vocal with that old Accept chanting style.<br /><br />Rolling Thunder - Has that 'Too High To Get it Right' vibe. Could have been on Metal Heart. Good driving sound and decent hook. Fresh.<br /><br />Pandemic - Sounds very 'Restless and Wild' style. Straight 80's chords and average lyrics, but good.<br /><br />New World Comin' - Has that ballady 'Princess of the Dawn' style, but works well. Just a weak chorus.<br /><br />Bucket Full Of Hate - A good track to close it off. Excellent old school Accept riffs and Chanting Vocal again.<br /><br />I will say that I am very glad in their Vocalist choice. I was an old T.T. Quick fan from way back and was surprised to hear Mark Tormillo got the spot. But on second thought, its very logical. He has that bar tested, vocal that is needed. You don't want (and could probably never find) an Udo II, but you do want that rough edge and the POWER that makes some of these tracks what they are. Face it, the lyrics themselves were NEVER very good in this band. Don't know if it was a language thing, but its the POWER of the vocalist that gets them through. The Execution. And I must say, I really like the rougher sound. And he can hit the high notes in that David Wayne (ex Metal Church) style that seals the deal. Just enough difference, and I swear the older stuff might sound better with this vocal style. he can HOLD those high notes.<br /><br />But what REALLY makes this disc, is the complete DOMINANCE of Wolf Hoffman and the incredible solo's on here. That brings this 4 disc to a 5. I mean the man is on FIRE! Almost dominant in a Michael Schenker style way. The solo's shine and really add energy to these songs. Yes, the Production of Andy Sneap is great and In your face (as usual), but the actual Guitar work is fantastic on this disc. I swear, the man is completely rejuvenated and it shows 100%. THAT is what makes this disc so damn good. I never thought of the Wolf as such a good guitarist, but those opinions have changed. Wolf gets an A+. Great performance throughout.<br /><br />That's what makes this a 5 for me. I appreciate the honesty in the music (not so much the lyrics), 90% of the tracks are excellent, like the liner notes on the digi pack of the CD and am floored by the guitar work. Sure, there are a few less than perfect tracks(that's why i almost gave a 4), but they made the right choice in a singer and I know this will get a lot of plays from me. PICK IT UP!.

B003V5PPZG|1.0|What a joke for a cd - Ive been a LP fan since the beginning but anyone thats rating this 4-5 stars seriously need help. This is not only a bad attempt to make a change with the direction of their music, but a really bad cd in general. I cannot understand how 6 members of a band - all very musically inclined - can sit around after finishing this and saying \\"wow! we've created a masterpiece!\\" Not even close. I can say that I still listen to LP's older music, but will never play this cd again.      - disappointed LP fan
B00006AUIG|4.0|This movie is so effective on every level, horror done right for a change. Those that didn't get it were the same ones that didn't get The Blair Witch project I'm sure. The subtleties and nuances of a true horror film far outweigh the brutal craziness that is cranked out these days...
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have two small kids and I usually like to be able to hear them when I'm using headphones. Sometimes I don't like to hear them ;) and I might wear headphones as a way to block some of the bickering. I have some high quality headphones with microphone and that's usually what I would use.    I had no idea the level of difference not only in sound quality but in ambient noise reduction that I'd get if I stepped up to a set of this price point.    I used them for Internet browsing, music and gaming. When I removed the headphones, I realized how much extraneous noise had been blocked even when I had no significant amount of sound coming through the set. I don't like my music or gaming to be loud but I do want it to be clear and this set went well beyond what I realized my machine was capable of.     As for me, I intend to use my headset (and I do mean \\"mine\\" b/c I'm squirreling it away for my use only) often, no matter what I'm doing with my computer.

B0011QC9U6|5.0|I came to Amazon to pick up a dvd of one of my favorite films.  Reading the reviews I can see that out of ten reviewers, six want their high school memories faithfully restored, two seem to understand the subtlety of story-telling, and the remaining two just don't get it at all.<br /><br />All that's needed to see what has been so lovingly and convincingly laid out in this stunningly scripted and singularly produced and directed film are two brief portions in two completely related scenes placed at either end of the story.  The first is our introduction to Hrothgar's hall, in which the honorable yet feckless king sadly, drunkenly, demands a kiss from his fair queen and her heart-felt response. The other is the last scene, as Grendel's mother beckons the honorable yet feckless Wiglaf to her side.<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />Beowulf was never a hero saga, it was and has ever been a tale of the ongoing crisis of the human male.
B003156AYQ|3.0|As one other reviewer mentioned, this book is half this, half that and half of another. Although I am not sure of that reviewer's math skills, they really hit the nail on the head in that this is barely about Steve Jobs and more about the company as a whole.<br /><br />Other than being a sociopath dictating control freak, I don't know much more about Jobs other than he did not invent anything from the software to the hardware, but has a say about it all.<br /><br />I cringe when I read \\"Most technological companies didn't...\\" giving the impression that Apple is the first, only, and end-all computer savior of the world. There were a number of similar type phrases where the untuned reader may miss the fact that there really were other companies who were just as on the spot genius as Apple was, but the book is not about them.<br /><br />Interesting book, but if you are really interested in what makes Steve tick, look elsewhere.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin is a best-selling author and well-known public speaker. His latest book, \\"Linchpin,\\" teaches us that indispensable people, who he calls linchpins or artists, think \\"along the edges of boxes, because that's where things get done.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Godin has written an entertaining, compelling and provocative work. He discussed how the workplace has evolved along with how our brain structure creates resistance for 9 to 5 success. I liked how the book was organized into short chapters with many interesting anecdotes from his own life and concise examples from famous and not-so famous people. The author's perspectives challenge our notions about the structure of work and the factory/office notion that defines modern-day jobs. Mr. Godin stressed that we must change to survive in a world where competition is not only around the corner but across the globe.<br /><br />Several Thought-Provoking Quotes<br /><br />One feature that I enjoyed was the amount of wisdom the author shared in easy-to-digest quotes sprinkled throughout the book. Here were a few of my favorites:<br /><br />\\"Linchpins make their own maps.\\"<br /><br />\\"They (linchpins) bring humanity to work. They don't leave it at home.\\"<br /><br />\\"Linchpins don't work in a vacuum.

B002M9WW30|5.0|Now this was a great deal!  I paid $32.99 for this box set!  That's six blu ray movies and one special bonus features blu ray disc!  I grew up on these Rocky movies and actually my favorite movie is Rocky III with all the characters still alive and kicking!  They did begin dying off at this point though!  Rocky V is my least favorite, it was too much of a downer for me I guess!  Stallone actually wanted to kill off his character when he wrote this one but the studio wouldn't let him!  Good thing though or else there wouldn't have been Rocky Balboa and we wouldn't have learned that Adrian had died leaving just Rocky, his son and Paulie of the originals!  Hey...could be the the title of his next movie...The Originals!...lol
B002ZG98UA|3.0|The Review:<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth installment in the franchise based on the incredibly successful Capcom video game series.  Afterlife is also riding the 3D movie trend that, for good or ill, has taken firm hold of Hollywood.  Using the same Fusion 3D techniques from the film Avatar, Afterlife looks great and is filled with stunts and action set pieces, with the story taking a back seat to the action.  The story, such as it is, suffers a bit because of the waters having been muddied over the course of the first 3 films and several video games.  I'm familiar with the video game source material and the prior films, and have a difficult time explaining the plot without the aid of Wikipedia or IMDB.  Reviewing the film is difficult because any serious attempt to analyze its story makes it apparent that there isn't much of a story to review.  Nonetheless, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a fun action movie set in the increasingly popular zombie apocalypse.  Manage your expectations and you'll find that there is much fun to be had, but don't go looking for the next 28 Days Later or The Descent.<br /><br />By way of background, Resident Evil is a re-imagining of George A. Romero style of zombie movies, with a liberal dose of late 20th and early 21st century angst added to the mix in the form of an omnipresent, and apparently omnipotent corporation called Umbrella.  Umbrella seems to have more resources than Apple, Microsoft and Black Water put together.  It dabbles in everything, including biological weapons.  In 2002's Resident Evil, one of those bio-weapons, the T-Virus escaped into one of Umbrella's massive research facilities, turning all its personnel into zombies.  Despite her best efforts, our hero, Alice, played by Milla Jovovich, is unable to stop the release of the virus, and over the course of the next two films, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction, the T-Virus went world-wide.  Afterlife picks up very soon after the events of 2007's Resident Evil: Extinction, and Alice, or to be more precise, several Alice's, have taken the fight to Umbrella Corporation, which inexplicably, has survived the world-wide zombie outbreak.  Governments have fallen, and small pockets of survivors struggle against the zombie hordes, but the evil of Umbrella is eternal.<br /><br />Now, Resident Evil: Afterlife has been savaged by mainstream film critics, with a 38 on [...].  And, if judged solely on its story, a mash up of Japanese video game and anime clich&eacute;s and American action movie making, Afterlife earns its mainstream film critic scorn.  Still I couldn't help but enjoy it as a great action movie held down by a B-move plot.  Afterlife shines when Alice and her ragtag band of survivors are shooting their way out of zombie infested LA prison.  It falters when it makes feeble attempts at characterization, or exposition.  Long lost siblings, amnesiac secondary characters, unexplained giants, supposedly normal human beings able to perform super heroic feats of strength and agility, and paper thin villains capable of predicting everything, except the most obvious things abound in Afterlife.  There doesn't seem to be a motivating force behind any of Umbrella's actions.  Is it trying to run the world?  Newsflash, Umbrella, you're the only entity left standing.  All the Governments are gone, and you're the only thing left with any serious technology or the ability to field any sort of military force.  But, this is kinda the problem with reviewing a film like Resident Evil: Afterlife.  My pondering the motivation of a fictitious corporation's efforts to control a runaway zombie virus is reminiscent of critics who called the movie Blade to the carpet for being unrealistic.  Well, duh!  It's Resident Evil folks.  It's just not the kinda movie that stands up to serious film critique.  What it is though, is dumb, end of summer movie season fun.  Heavy on action, and very weak on story.  I had plenty of funwatching it, but upon reflection, I have to admit that the story is kinda dumb.<br /><br />That's one way of saying that Resident Evil is a fun, but dumb action franchise designed primarily to deliver a sequel every few years so long as each film returns a high enough profit.  The stunts are great and the action scenes are really helped out by excellent use of 3D effects.  If you want a smart zombie film, then I recommend Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and Zombie Land.  If you want a great action focused zombie movie that showcases the newest in 3D tech, see Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: I purchased my own tickets.ion, I have to admit that the story is kinda dumb.

B003V5PPZG|1.0|Wow I cant even begin to describe how awful this cd is. As soon as I got it I put on my Zune then I listened to it a took it off my Zune. From start to finish this cd is crap. Like techno mixed with pop and 90's pop rock. If your a LP fan stir clear of this cd however if you like Jason Mraz mixed with Lady Gaga then this cd is for you

0439023513|1.0|So what was the point of this series? What is Panem supposed to represent? What were the rebels really fighting for? What nourishment does this book offer me in my current world? I always thought the books, though page-turners, were morally hollow, that Collins manipulated her characters and her plots as surely as did any of the organizers of The Hunger Games but this book suffered from an even worse crime--it was boring.  I didn't know who anyone was, where anyone was except underground or in a hospital room or looking at weapons, and I didn't know what Katniss wanted, what she believed in, or anything. And I didn't care about anyone or anything. I abandoned it 50 pages from the end and read reviews to find out what happened. A poorly edited mess.

0374158460|5.0|Couldn't put this book down and finished it in a week which is rare as I normally read at snail's pace. Captures eloquently the changes that occurred from the 70's through to now, with particular emphasis on the deranged 2000's, the era when society all but stopped pretending to even be a society. It's a big picture book that distills modern life better than all the finest newspaper opinion articles put together.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|For the recent USA and world tours of Cohen's famous \\"return from retirement,\\" Roscoe Beck put together the very best band that Cohen has ever sung with. The essence of those tours was captured on the Live in London recordings that were made relatively early in the tours. The London Concert was a masterpiece, each of the gems from Cohen's extensive catalogue further refined, lyrics tweaked, phrasings improved, inflections moved, modulations shifted . . . all small things technically but that added up to easily the most powerful perfomences of Cohen's career.    This album is more of that, with the same band, generally different tunes, each picked for its performance quality rather than trying to keep the songs within one concert.     If you enjoyed the London Concert CD, you'll enjoy these performances.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|At first, I wasn't incredibly happy with the album, but as I listened to the songs I fell in love with this album.  There are so many great rocking songs.  My favorites are Brick By Boring Brick, All I Wanted, and Ignorance.  All their albums are great, but I think this is their best one yet.  Great job Paramore.
1584282584|5.0|I had heard about this book a few times over the months but did not believe that on camera flash could produce a good image without heavy shadows of extra shine. I had gone to a workshop of a well know wedding photographer and was convinced the only way to get fantastic shots was with a secondary off camera light source (umbrella). After reading the this book the first time, I experimented with with bounce and was thoroughly impressed with the results of the half snoot bounce. I read it a second time and incorporated Neil's techniques into my work flow. I have had more than a couple of people tell me my indoor shots look like they were done without flash look natural.  I particularly like the way this book shows extra example of the shot with an under or over exposure of the shot.  If you want to use bounce flash and kick your shots to another level buy this book, read it a couple of times and try some of the techniques.

B000003CUJ|5.0|There are many recordings of the overtures and preludes from Wagner's various operas floating around: many of them highly recommendable for those who wish to hear some orchestral highlights from Wagner's massive works or those who don't generally enjoy opera.      My favorite recording of overtures and preludes is the two disc set on EMI of Adrian Boult conducting various English orchestras ([[ASIN:B000002S08 Wagner: Overtures & Preludes]]). It is a bargain with almost 2 ½ hours of the best performed and recorded orchestral Wagner on disc. Included are pieces from Tannhauser, Parsifal, Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg,  Der Fliegende Hollander, and of course items (about 40 minutes worth) from the \\"Ring\\" cycle. Highly recommended.      But returning to this disc. Maazel had endeavored, and in my opinion succeeded, in putting together an orchestral concert suite of themes from the Ring cycle. It includes the favorites that pop up on many Wagner highlight discs (including the above Boult set) such as: Entry of the Gods into Valhalla, the Ride of the Valkyries, Forest Murmurs, Siegfried's Death and Funeral March (familiar to fans of John Boorman's film \\"Excalibur\\") and Siegfried's Rhine Journey.  But it goes beyond that by adding in briefer orchestral and vocal pieces (but without the vocals) to link the larger passages together and create, in effect, one \\"symphonic poem\\" which follows the events of the opera cycle chronologically while presenting many of Wagner's leitmotifs.      The result is a cohesive work, beautifully performed by Maazel and the Berlin Philharmonic and captured by the Telarc engineers in their state of the art DDD sound. (Well state of the art in 1988 but this recording still sounds excellent.)  Some reviewers have complained that some of the movements - such as the Ride of the Valkyries and Forest Murmurs - are not heard in their entirety and that is true. But in eliminating some repeats, editing some items, and connecting all the selections Maazel has created a suite of music that flows and maintains a nice dramatic pace. If you want the complete orchestral selections then I recommend the Boult collection. If you're feeling more adventurous, a set of Ring highlights including vocals might be in order: I like Bohm's 2-disc set on Philips ([[ASIN:B0000041EJ Wagner: The Best of the Ring]]). But again, for what Maazel is attempting here I think the results are excellent and unique.      Find a 70 minute block of time, put on the headphones, and listen to this nicely arranged and performed disc of music from Wagner's epic \\"Ring\\" cycle.

0393072231|4.0|This is approximately the 20th book I have read on the Financial Crisis. It comes from a very different perspective then previous books. Lewis writes about a few obscure people who became obsessed with the housing bubble and shorted it in various ways to reap enormous profits when the bubble burst. Lewis made some people who were previously known quite famous in the world when he included them in the book. Michael Burry, and Steve Eisman in particular gained quite some fame due to Lewis.    The thing I liked the most about this book was how these several individuals went against the entire world's opinion to take a daring bet that the conventional wisdom (housing prices dont go down ever). It is fascinating how each person discovered some new and obscure investments such as Credit default swaps to reap huge profits. The thing I liked least about the book was the short ending. there is little detail about how these investors acted after Lehman Brothers collapsed. And how they felt about being right all along. Overall, the book is an informative and interesting read.     I write exclusively for my a financial website devoted to investing. I wrote a more in depth review which I can not post here, due to their exclusive rights to my articles. To see my more in depth review either visit the site I write for or my website.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|I purchased this knife through Amazon and as recieved in about five weeks would rate it a 3 but after a half hour of work on it feel it will be a strong 4 or low 5.    The edge on the blade was the absolute worst I personally have ever had on an as purchased blade. The edge was so ragged it was nearly a saw cut. My sharpening skills are minimal and I tend therefore to go slow. After fifteen minutes initially with a 80 grit sander block and an additional fifteen minutes with 150 grit it's approaching a usable edge.     The knife itself seems quite sturdy and expect it will give good service. After a bit more time on the edge I'm pretty sure it will rank with the better knives I've owned and used. Stout enough to baton firewood makes it a pretty heavy hunk of iron. The Kydex sheath is typical large clunky and servicable. It gives enough area to have a good wrapping area for spare paracord and if you are handy, making a firesteel pouch to attach.    I do recommend the knife, if you are willing to spend the time to finish what should have been done at the factory.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|With so many \\"legacy\\" performers clogging the AARP superhighway, I suspect that as of this writing, there are three clear pathways to mature rock success.<br /><br />First, you can recreate the sounds, attitudes and poses that made your black light poster a must have forty years gone. This turn back the clock approach is generally considered the most effective and lucrative but, admit it, lives a little too close to the intersection of boring and catatonic.<br /><br />Second, you can take your crows feet for a spin in the Great American Songbook and hope that the aging crones in the front row never notice that the equipment you were packing in the time of Nixon is now more memory than Mastodon.<br /><br />Or, finally, you can challenge yourself to discover new sounds and push new boundaries - letting the music transport your audience and heavy metal roots far beyond the sturm and drung of the critics and naysayers - showing some genuine mettle instead.<br /><br />Robert Plant doesn't need me to tell him how glad I am that he selected door number three. His new record, Band of Joy, is a charming and austere roots music walkabout that continues his fascination with acoustic blues that has never waned since his arrival on the Hindenburg in 1969. His voice is well, his voice, unmistakable as it is powerful. The songs - pulled from a portfolio of lesser known rock and blues chestnuts allow Plant to wander a little over the top at times but in most cases joyously explore their power in between the lines with the subtlety of an artist rather than the clanking swagger of an icon that has overstayed his welcome.<br /><br />Band of Joy is a sterling, first-rate effort that should not be missed.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|Works like a charm! Perfect condition and delivery was just tremendous. Ill be enjoying my favorite band just a little more in the comfort of my own living room :)
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I love this CD. The best part was being able to preview all the songs before I bought it. Once I listened to all the previews, I was sold. I am very pleased with this purchase.
0545123275|3.0|I'll admit the book is better written than \\"Twilight,\\" I got tired of the constant descriptions of smells. We get it--the characters have great senses of smell. And the make-out scenes are so gross. Also, there's no build up in Grace and Sam's relationship; they start going out as soon as they meet. Plus, every time I think of Sam, I think of Sam Merlotte from the Sookie Stackhouse books. Couldn't the author think of a more creative name? Worth a read, but nothing special.

B0002TKFRM|1.0|While the performance is fine, there are limits to what remastering these old recordings can do. The sound is simply just not that good, both the SACD layer or plan CD layer. No more Living Stereo recordings for me.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|This is an excellent (and very easy to read) book that deals with some of the harsh realities of: marriage; having children; infidelity; broken dreams; disillusionment; being in love with someone who's in love with someone else; and the struggle to make sense out of a sometimes overwhelmingly chaotic and disappointing life.  Truly, I found it mesmerizing and almost impossible to put down.  I can understand how, according to one of the dust jacket reviews, one might want to try reading the entire thing in one sitting.  I found myself reading it for several hours at a time, well into the night, even after being exhausted from a long day at work.  The characters are very real and I found myself relating to them on many levels.  Also, the book made me more conscious of the threat we pose to our environment and I want to learn more about preserving our great outdoors - I for one love to go outside and enjoy the rivers, trees, and beaches out there and I'd hate to see them destroyed by pollution and big business.  I will say there were a few small parts in the story that I found a little disgusting (like the search for the wedding band) but I won't get into those here.  I highly recommend this book and think it will pass the test of time and become a classic.  If I were to compare it to a contemporary movie, I'd have to say it reminds me a bit of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD.  Anyway, it's also great, I think, for people dealing with their own struggle to make sense out of life.  I think it's a great story about human nature, how morality can be a huge gray area, and how one can sometimes find hope in life's simple things...
0374158460|1.0|What's to like about this book? This is not great literature. Turning each page was an effort, to make it to the next. I couldn't make it past the first chapter. I read an average of twenty, thirty books a year, this was by by far the worst I've read this year Where is the beauty of writing, the skill of inviting the reader into the tale,not here.Don't believe the hype.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|Most TV sitcoms today are so inane and hopeless they are painful to watch (but easy to turn off).  Not so with Modern Family, a truly funny look at a diverse family that never disappoints.  The cast is great and the writing top notch.  Let's hope it continues to be successful.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This is what rock music should sound like. I thought it was great to get Krokus back again, but having most of ACCEPT back again is a dream come true for a big fan like me.

B00127RAJY|5.0|OMG is all I can say.  I bought it on Ebay for about $5.00 and thought this would be a fluff workout...HA!! Level 1 was challenging and this comes from someone who went from hitting the gym 6 days a week doing 60 mins cardio and weight training daily...then to P90X.....then to staying at home not working out at all.  So I've been on both sides of the fitness coin and I must say, after awakening my body from a lengthy rest, it is tough.  I started it once before and gave up on day 2.  I am currently on day 3 and am sore as ever and this is level 1. Just because it is level 1 does not mean that it is not challenging...it is just the least challenging of the challenge.  Invest in this.  It is a great workout to have in your arsenal.  In fact, in comparison to P90X it definitely was the better value for my $$$.  I would say do this on each level, 30 days a piece (so level 1 30 days, level 2 30 days, level 3 30 days) and then start over using heavier weights.  I also supplement this workout with some additional cardio...but it is not necessary at all...I'm just a maniac :-).  I figure, if crazily obese people on Biggest Loser can drop a ton 'o' lbs with this lady, there must be something to it.  I am going to look into the other trainers' workouts as well.
0765326353|5.0|I started reading Mr. Sanderson's previous books, like the mistborn series, once I knew that he was going to continue RJ's WOT series. I found those books good, but not as good as RJ's WOT (I started reading WOT from the 3rd book, Dragon Reborn, and back track from it to the 1st and 2nd book, and then waited patiently for the next books).    I found the book before this, the Warbreaker, to be better than the previous books, but still not on the level of RJ's WOT.    When reading Storm Light Archive 1st book, the Way of Kings, I am very, very pleasantly surprised. Finally, one of Sanderson's book that are on the level of RJ WOT 1st book, the Eye of the World, which is significantly better than other 1st book in a series, like Terry Brook's Shannara series, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, RR martin's Song of Ice and Fire series etc.    I am even more surprised when I discover that it is going to be a ten book series. I mean, Sword of Truth is originally a trilogy, WOT is also originally a trilogy. I never heard of a book that are originally planned to be 10 books series. It is possible that L. Ron Hubbard's Mission series or Roger Zelazny Amber series are planeed as 5+ books series, since I didn't know the history of those 2 series (jumped late, after the series is finished).    I am looking forward to reading the future books in this series, and I already finished 2nd reading of this book. Re-reading a book you just finished is a very good  indicator that you like the book A LOT, and I only done this with less than 10 books in my whole life. I think I am going to start develop an itch if the 2nd book is not out by December 2011.    If you like fantasy books, buy and enjoy this book. You will NOT regret it.

B000FGGE68|2.0|Everything they say about this movie proves to be true.  It's as if somebody made a film based on those Esurance commercials.    This movie seems hell-bent on destroying any suspension of disbelief.  Whenever there's an impressive shot (and there are many), it's ruined by stiff cartoon backgrounds and characters who look cel-shaded.  I wouldn't dignify Ultraviolet by comparing it to a game, because that's an insult to games.     The nicest scenes are between Violet and the boy she's trying to protect.  You know, defrosting ice queen and her surrogate kid.  THE OLDEST TROPE KNOWN TO MAN.  The commentary track is informative.  It's just Milla and her puppies in the soundbooth, going \\"This was the funnest scene to do.\\", and \\"so kewl.\\"    You can't even praise the set design, because it's all shot in Shanghai office towers.  There aren't any fight sequences, because Violet kills everybody instantaneously.  Well, there is that final battle, which lasts about a minute.  In pitch blackness.  Thanks for nothing, Kurt Wimmer.    The bad guy, Vice Cardinal Daxus, is kind of amusing.  Why \\"Vice\\" Cardinal? Did they think it sounded cool? ...Except later, they call him Arch Minister?  What is this I don't even...    This is just a modeling gig for Milla Jovovich.  Say what you will about the Resident Evil movies, at least Alice had a degree of, you know, pathos.  Violet talks in catchphrases 100% of the time.  I still don't know why her clothes keep changing color.  ..Well, like I said, it's a commercial. This is not a movie.  This is an anti-movie.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|Awesome start to a great direction. But why all the hate?    People who were expecting the same old same old. That's why. A band with as much creative talent as Linkin Park can't possibly continue expressing themselves by sticking to the same sound just to please a few, albeit vocal, purists.     \\"This sounds nothing like the old Linkin Park,\\" is what I keep reading, but for anyone who TRULY follows LP will notice quite a bit of similarity to Reanimation and Meteora with a hint of Minutes to Midnight; of course a little extra grime for good measure. This is absolutely a progression. Minutes to Midnight was empty and lacked a lot of depth. This album takes the intention of Minutes to Midnight and infuses the heart of Meteora with the electronic beat of Reanimation. Think Nine Inch Nails with a little hip-hop. It's damn near perfect.    What keeps this from being a five star album? Well, two things.    First, the lack of content. The first two tracks are what one would consider intro tracks. Yes... the album starts with TWO tracks that don't even contain a complete song with lyrics. The rest of the album is split by four \\"intermission\\" tracks which either seemed unnecessarily split or just forced in order to tie a couple tracks together.    The second reason are the lyrics. Now I'm a fan of good lyrics (I even have a lyric from \\"P5hng Me A*wy\\" off Reanimation etched on my iPod) but I don't generally care as long as a song is good. While all these songs are good and listen-worthy at the very least, I can't help but get bothered by the repetitiveness of many of the songs. Half of them contain lyrics which are repeated 4-16 times. No, that's not a typo... that's sixteen. It works on a lot of their songs, but when the lyrics aren't as content-rich as past albums I would like to see more substance.    Overall this is a must-have album for anyone who likes a good song, but not for anyone looking for a replica of the past.
0553805371|2.0|I think one of the other reviewers said it best when he said...\\"This book suffers from a real weakness: it often makes vague suggestions without offering substantive science. We are left with hazy conjectures when hard scientific realism is mandatory. Science is based on proof with mathematics as its rigorous handmaiden. Hawking offers us a handful of illustrations and some short anecdotal evidence in its stead. I found that deeply unsatisfactory...\\"    If Stephen Hawking was attempting to answer fundamental questions such as:  \\"Why and via what process does anything exist?\\" or \\"In the absence of a creator, what exactly is the provable mechanism by which our universe could \\"pop\\" into being from nothingness?\\" then I am perplexed as to how this book even comes close to answering such questions from a naturalistic viewpoint.         Theism clearly wins the day in being the sole plausible cosmological argument for answering the questions of \\"something from nothing\\", \\"the purpose/presence of morality\\", the \\"impossibility of infinite causes without a non-caused personal causer\\", \\"the arising of cellular information from non-information\\", \\"the existence of irreducably complex organisms\\", \\"the arising of life from non-life\\", and other questions that naturalism continually proves itself to be completely bankrupt in addressing.
B003TJ4YU6|1.0|Save your money. A very disappointing \\"new\\" release that has all of 13 minutes of Sullivan \\"filler\\" as new bonus material. The \\"re-mastered\\" picture quality is a joke. Earlier \\"bootleg\\" versions actually have crisper picture quality than this re-issue. Sound quality is mediocre at best - you have to to turn your volume up way high to hear the songs the way that nature intended. Overall, a very forgettable issue. Again, save your money and buy the original issued set.
B00006JJ2Y|5.0|While most live albums are what you would expect from a concert, Lou grabs the emotions and philosophies of the day and puts it out there.  I wish I had been there.  The band is great.  Lou steps out and gives a show that is honest to himself and the songs.  His songs are powerful to begin with, but he puts all this energy and emotion behind the songs, they rachet way up there.  Possibly the best live album ever.  Certainly the most honest live album.  He allows his audience, and us, to see what is truly behind his song writing.
0553805371|1.0|Hawking may have been a significant physicist several decades ago, but in this latest popularization, he wanders far from his field of expertise. He commits a slew of logical and semantic fallacies that would put even a casual student of philosophy to shame. For instance, he confuses the two senses of \\"law\\": Law as decree, and law as a description of what takes place in nature. He starts out with \\"law\\" in the second sense, as applies to gravity, and then comically commits the fallacy of equivocation, substituting the first sense and concluding that gravity can actually bring things (like universes) into being.     He alternately contradicts himself by asserting in one place that he thinks that the universe can bring *itself* into being before it existed, and elsewhere that *nothingness itself* somehow has the \\"power\\" to bring the universe into being!     Thus he shows a seeming inability to grasp even the simplest of philosophical concepts (such as ex nihilo nihil fit), as well as a deterioration in his ability to reason logically, since he cannot see that something cannot bring *itself* into being before it existed, since it would already have to be there! This notion is as nonsensical as a \\"married bachelor\\" or \\"square circle\\".    Clearly the man should be sticking to his math equations instead of putting on an amateur night at the philosophers' club. He is talking off his field, and even the astute layman can discern that he knows not whereof he speaks.    It would be instructive to watch this man debate a competent philosopher such as William Lane Craig or Alvin Plantinga, but sadly this probably will not be. He is too proud to be corrected by them in public, and too lazy (or mentally unable) to grasp even the most basic principles of philosophy. Give this one a miss.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is amazing. The symbolism is astounding, cinematography blows you away, the soundtrack is amazing and Lee Pace does an incredible job.    The story is like walking into a fantastic world. Yes, an insane world, but one that makes you pause and consider.     However, if you're looking for a shallow fantasy flick, this is not the movie to get. It touches on some deep themes, a lot of which you miss the first time. That is what I love most about this movie. Everytime I see it, I notice something new about it.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Super high quality picture on Blu Ray-this movie is almost as stunning as Avatar on BD. I had ZERO problems with loading times watching on my Plasystation 3. (note-the ps3 plays avatar just fine also, no problems with load times).    This movie also has a BOOKMARK feature-which is incredibly important to me.
B000002UVX|5.0|I have always thought of Mr. Jimi Hendrix as one of the best guitarists of all time, but he was never one I would listen to since the sound quality on a lot of recordings is just awful unfortunately. I just listened to this album after having it in my collection for several months. I now have no doubt in my mind that Jimi is the GREATEST guitarist of all time. Nothing has ever made me feel like this has. This is the most incredible guitar I have EVER heard, and I listen to a lot of music (and quality guitarists). From now on, when people ask for proof that Jimi was the greatest, I will point them to this album. This has inspired me to a whole new level of love and respect for the guitar. It's so hard for me to put into words just HOW inspiring this album is. But it just is. I would honestly pay $30 for these 6 songs. They are worth every penny. I hope anyone thinking about giving this a listen will take my advice and listen without delay and that it inspires them as much as it has inspired me.

His writing style is clear and clean. It is refreshing that Chris takes a \\"guru-free\\" approach and puts his ideas out there for your consideration. What you do with them is up to you.
0439023513|3.0|Well, well, well. Here we are, at the end of the road. And it's not at all what I hoped for. I placed my pre-order for Suzanne Collins's Mockingjay the minute I finished reading Catching Fire, hoping for a great conclusion, a story that ends with a major bang. Instead, I got a confused and somewhat muddled mess.    To be fair, there was a lot riding on this last book. The first two were so excellent and so gripping, Collins set a very high bar for herself. Sadly, she didn't reach it. The plot and character development meander quite a bit through the story as Katniss finds her place and her voice in the rebellion. There are parts that sparkle and I was left wondering what was going to happen with the whole Katniss-Gale-Peeta love triangle. But sadly, when I finished the book, I was left feeling . . . well, a bit empty. Not at all satisfied.    Now granted, I only finished reading the book about twelve hours ago, so I haven't had a lot of time to analyze what I've read and why I'm feeling so disappointed. But I have some preliminary thoughts I'd like to share.    First of all, there's what the book lacked: another Game. That's what truly made the first two books so special, the idea of the Districts sending their children into the Hunger Games. I was riveted through what happened to Katniss in the first book. When I read the second, I wondered how Collins would incorporate this unique concept again, hence why I was fascinated by the Quarter Quell, how similar and yet different it was from Katniss's first trip into the arena.    Collins doesn't send anyone into the Games this time. She does try to paint the on-going rebellion as a \\"Games-in-real-life\\" kind of thing by having Katniss followed around by a camera crew, but it's not the same. It's not even close. So there's the first problem: one of the things that made Collins's book so unique was missing.    Second, there's the focus. Collins seemed more interested in what was going on around Katniss than in Katniss andher emotional journey. When Peeta and Katniss were reunited, I was at first thrilled and then crushed (no spoilers here, I hope) but then Peeta faded into the background, barely registering. The same thing happens to Gale throughout the book. He's little more than an aggressive, war-mongering sidekick with no real emotional entanglement. Part of the zing of the first two books was the whole \\"love triangle\\" with Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. And even though the question is resolved in the end, it was done in such a haphazard way it didn't really feel like a resolution. Katniss didn't earn a resolution or even marginally participate in one. Instead, Collins just told us what the resolution was with very little build up or logic to it, especially given what happened to all the characters in the book.    Third, there's the sprinting. It almost feels as though Collins had a wordcount limit she couldn't exceed. She meandered through the rest of the book and, once the war was resolved, she realized she didn't nearly have enough space to finish the disparate story threads and do justice to them. But rather than go back and do some cutting, she simply sprinted through to the ending, skimming over major developments that, in my not-so-humble opinion, deserved deeper treatment. Once again, the resolution to the love triangle. Given how central that was to the first two books, it deserved to be featured a lot more and have at least a couple of chapters dedicated to its eventual resolution so we understand why Katniss does what she does and how she comes to her final conclusions.    All in all, it was an okay book. I really wish it could have been better, because I think Katniss deserved better given all that she's been through.

006145205X|4.0|Firstly, this book is a wonderful review of the history of trade and innovation, which is a good enough reason to read it.  I learned a lot.  As I flipped the pages I couldn't quite thinking about the work of the New Economics Institute.  They are attacking the whole notion of \\"rational\\" which headlines Ridley's book.  In the end though, Ridley makes a strong case for why this world will muddle through our great economic challenges.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Once again Janelle shines as an Android who dreams metallic thoughts of her forbidden love. She is the new female Prince of our time. From classical overtures, hysterical rock, 60's era love songs, classy brass, electronica, classic r&b and MJ-like ballads, homegirl has it all. The thing I love the most: none of her songs sound the same. To quote one of her songs... it' like \\"Neon Gumbo\\"! I hope she keeps dishing 'em out cuz I'm buying. You gotta check her out!
0553805371|3.0|After all the fuss about whether Hawkins believes in God or not, I had to go get this book.  I just can't articulate it any better than the review I just read.  As the Economist magazine just noted,\\"whenever the going threatens to get tough, the authors retreat into hand-waving, and move briskly on to the next awe-inspiring notion. Anyone who can follow their closing paragraphs on the relation between negative gravitational energy and the creation of the universe probably knows it all already. This is physics by sound-bite.\\"  Further, \\"It is the bare bones of quantum mechanics that have proved to be consistent with what is presently known of the subatomic world. The authors' interpretations and extrapolations of it have not been subjected to any decisive tests, and it is not clear that they ever could be.\\"

B001MYIXAC|4.0|First off, I loved this movie. I thought it was haunting and innocent and just really beautiful.<br /><br />My only issue was the dubbing. I expected subtitles, which is fine (I do read, lol!), but this DVD had been dubbed. The voices were TERRIBLE. Didn't match the people and it was just weird.<br /><br />I'll probably re-buy this when they re-release it with the theatrical subtitles.<br /><br />But all in all, a great film!!
B000001FQI|5.0|Simply a wonderful album with the added bonus of Oleta Adams! Together these guys are one of the most imagiative pair I've heard. Their voices sync well and the lyrics match their harmony. I hate they had to part after this and took 15 years to get back together.
B003WKOLQO|5.0|Ah, Volbeat.  I remembered I had no idea who these guys were until I had seen them with Lamb of God and Metallica back in November of 2009.  Immediately after the show, Volbeat had earned themselves a hardcore fan of sorts.  I now have each of their albums, and not a single ounce of regret comes with it.  This past week, their newest album dropped on us.<br /><br />Not only is it probably their best record, but it's probably one of the best hard rock/metal albums of the year.<br /><br />For those of you who follow Volbeat's story-telling, this album is a sequel to Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood.  For the rest of us, it's just another album of pure awesomeness.  No weird intros to build up into it, the album takes off with the energetic \\"Mirror and the Ripper\\".  With this album, it's clear that Volbeat take a lot of different ideas from the rock spectrum for use on this album.  \\"Who They Are\\" is sort of reminiscent of Slayer in the beginning of the song, \\"Fallen\\" takes a Foo Fighters 'Everlong' approach but doesn't come off as copycatty.  Then the album begins to get hard and heavy.  \\"7 Shots\\" will surely be appreciated by old school thrash fans, old and new.  \\"16 Dollars\\" is a punk-rock throw-down of its own.<br /><br />However, if you're a metal-head like me, then you'll probably absolutely fall in love with \\"Evelyn\\", a very catchy song that features the vocal talents of Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway from Napalm Death.  While a questionable choice, it happens to fit perfectly in place, so it's alright.  Fans of Volbeat will deeply appreciate hearing \\"Thanks\\".<br /><br />Matter of fact, there's only one thing I don't like about the album and even so it's a mild complaint compared to the problems with a lot of newer hard rock albums... that is, I'll never understand why Volbeat decided to put \\"A Warrior's Call\\" on this album.  As good of a song as it is, it was out last year and it was written for a boxer.  The song just doesn't fit with the story-telling.  They're lucky Warrior's Call is a good tune.<br /><br />Overall, Volbeat has put out a very fantastic album that you owe it to yourself to check out if you have the chance.ne.

B003L20IE2|5.0|Scott Pilgrim, both the Graphic Novels and the Movie, are wonderful and entertaining as well as the beat-em-up Ubisoft game, which digs a bit deeper into the Graphic Novels than the movie does. The movie left some characters out as well as some really awesome scenes and also moved some scenes around in the storyline. Even though things were changed, you still get the full effect as the original Graphic Novels of pure awesome. Scott Pilgrim was portrayed by Michael Cera so well that I can't see the character as anyone else when thought in a real life aspect. All the other characters were spot on, and if not, close as you can get in real life. The movie made this not so believable action a little more believable than expected, but still given that epic unrealistic twist that Scott Pilgrim is supposed to deliver. They left out some of the best gags from the Graphic Novel, but the movie still had so many of the one liners that it still felt genuine. Also, the one liners were apparent in being misplaced in the story. (It's hard to explain this without telling them and ruining some things! lol) This movie should go down as a cult classic, especially to Video Game fans. The movie is worth a BluRay buy!!!

B003V5PPZG|1.0|Or at least that is what the world tries to claim every time they attempt to excuse a rock band suddenly going soft and dropping the \\"rock\\" from their music. I believe these people call it \\"maturing\\". I love reading posts where fans desperately try to make excuses for bands who decide to not do rock music anymore. When did guitars become childsplay? I was always under the impression that it takes FAR more talent and skill to write guitar riffs and melodies than it does to play with computer Pro-Tools and synthesizers. Of course, I could be wrong. But if anything, what most people call \\"maturing\\" is actually just \\"copping out\\" so they don't have to spend as much time writing good instrumental parts and thus they take the simplified path. Silverchair did it (and became a disgraceful pop-funk nightmare) and now Linkin Park is doing it.<br /><br />The new Linkin Park album is, indeed, a collection of simplified, melodramatic, electronic nonsense. I guarantee that had this album been the first Linkin Park album, they would not have 75% of the fans that they currently do. Why? Because there is nothing special or unique here. Anyone with computer knowledge and basic music writing skills could create this. I mean why are there no guitars on here? Why couldn't they write non-aggressive riffs? Oh, I forgot, because guitars are only for angry, immature kiddies. Linkin Park is now a collection of \\"mature\\" men evolving into great musicians by taking all of the substance away from their sound. Err wait...What? Give me a break. No, the real reason there are no guitars here is because they are getting lazy and don't want to be bothered with writing new guitar riffs that they have to try to play live. It's so much easier to let the computers and keyboards do all the instrumental work for you.<br /><br />Then I read a lot of these \\"they don't want to do that type of music anymore\\" posts. OK, Great! Then change the name of the band and stop trying to capture your former glory under the deceitful label of your former band and sound. If you want to make all new, all different music then make an all new, all different name and stop tarnishing the Linkin Park name with your \\"experiments\\". Darn those silly, immature guitars anyways, always holding rock musicians back from maturing like this and writing such evolved, brilliant computerized and auto-tuned music out there like the true matured geniuses behind Black Eyed Peas, Kanye West and Justin Bieber.

That's how it is for half of the poor souls who read that tripe on here.<br /><br />Anyways, I heard this album online a few days ago and knew right away that it was not worth purchasing. There are more intermissions and \\"tracklist noise\\" than Tool's latest cd. But at very least Tool rewards you with authentic maturity when you get to the actual songs. Linkin Park's new cd taunts and teases with all these serious, atmospheric segues that build into songs that can lull you to sleep. I won't do an in-depth review of the album because there is enough of that already on here. But when \\"Blackout\\" (arguably the heaviest track) actually sounds out of place compared to the rest of the songs on a Linkin Park cd, then that is when you should realize that the name on the album's cover should not be \\"Linkin Park\\".

0439023513|5.0|Once again, I feel stifled by these darn starred rating systems. How can I only give Mockingjay five stars? Is there no justice in this world?<br /><br />Needless to say, I liked Mockingjay. A lot. Ms. Collins does not disappoint in this culmination of her wildly popular Hunger Games trilogy. My only disappointment is that it is the last book of the series.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a grim and gritty book -- more so than its predecessors, which is really saying a lot. The story picks up shortly after the conclusion of Catching Fire. Katniss and her fellow rescued tributes are recovering from the trauma of the arena in the once-hidden District 13, now hub of the rebellion against the Capitol. Unfortunately, not everyone made it out -- Katniss' district partner and fiance, Peeta, has been captured and is assumed dead. Other notable friends from the series are also missing in action, or have met with untimely and unpleasant ends at the orders of the ominous President Snow. And Katniss' home -- and most of her neighbors and friends -- are gone as a result of the mass bombing of District 12 at the end of the Quarter Quell.<br /><br />Katniss takes center stage in this final phase of the rebellion, agreeing to serve as the symbollic leader of the resistance -- the Mockingjay. Her love triangle is put on hold, both due to Peeta's captivity and Gale's growing political and strategic entanglement in the uprising.<br /><br />Mockingjay takes readers into a new sort of game, but the traps, betrayals and deception that were so riviting in the first two \\"Games\\" books are not missing from this conclusion. The landscape is different, but the stakes are just as high and the drama just as compelling.<br /><br />I found Collins' portrayal of Katniss in this book refreshingly realistic. She doesn't write this herione as a superhuman girl that unerringly comes out ahead, even against impossible odds. The Katniss we meet in Mockinjay is broken, emotionally, mentally and physically. She's lost almost everything she loves, and is weighing the benefits and risks of the additional sacrifices she's been asked to make for her fellow rebels. She's every bit the reluctant hero, and a sympathetic one at that. I loved how Collins allowed her to be a flawed leader, and was satisfied with her arc and her ending.<br /><br />However, some supporting characters really disappointed me in this book. As a mother, I found myself repeatedly shaking my head in disgust over the actions of Katniss' mother, for example. On the other hand, I feel I know Haymitch after reading Mockingjay, and understand and like him much more after reading this book. Collins is masterful at picking up threads from her previous books and weaving them unexpectedly and effortlessly into the final work. Her circles back to characters like Finnick and Annie made the story richer and more satisfying for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am sad to see the series finish, but thrilled that I was along for the whole ride.

Looks like the author,  after building this complicated story, didn't know how to end it, so she  resorted to the creation ( SPOILER ALERT) of a character who never appeared  previously during the narration.  The characters, including the protagonist and narrator, are sort of non-descript, the landscape is bleak to say the least and the story unfolds through different voices and perspectives, all of them equally flat.  The book is dark, because describe 'dark' occurrences and practices, such as Satanism, but it does shake the reader: sadly it ends up being just boring, beyond its grittiness.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay, the final book in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy, closes the series with a shrug. In a sense, a lot happens in the book: a civilization is overthrown, good people die, bad people die, the romantic triangle of Katniss-Peeta-Gale is finally unraveled. Still, while reading it it feels like nothing much ever happens. Katniss--who, admittedly, has been through a lot (but who in this society hasn't?)--mopes around and spends most of her time being sick or injured or overwhelmed. She takes up the mantle of \\"Mockingjay,\\" the figurehead of the rebellion, only reluctantly. The war that she has helped foment never feels real: the dramatic action takes place largely off-stage, and it plays out like a video game, with exploding pods and other special effects. Despite the death count, it never feels like anything important is at stake. When Katniss is allowed to become involved in the action, which is rarely, it's as the star of a photo op: yes, she fights against the restrictions imposed on her and finds a way to get her hands bloodied, but still, the nature of her involvement makes it seem less than heroic. There is, in short, never very much tension in the book--and that includes romantic tension. I would probably have enjoyed this one more if my memory of what happened in the first two books were fresher. As it is, there were people and events referred to that I had no recollection of. This surely added to my general lack of investment in the characters this time around.<br /><br />Although its conclusion offers hope, Mockingjay is not the most uplifting of reads. One dystopia is nearly replaced with another, and humans are shown to be an inherently defective species. The ending makes sense: it reminds me of the final scene of the Holocaust television miniseries, in which children playing soccer signified (or so I remember the scene, thirty years later) the potential for a better future. And the last few lines of the last chapter of Mockingjay are simply perfect.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelrfect.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B002QEISMA|5.0|While moving to a genre that is infested with a lot of Dream Theater style bands, Riverside ventures into this territory giving their own take on it, and I was impressed. They can certainly stand out in that genre; think along the lines of Pain of Salvation.   Welcome to the A list !
0374158460|3.0|Don't quite know what all the hype is about this book...guess the literary world is searching for a hero and has decided to create one themselves.  It was entertaining, but increasingly annoying as the characters spouted what I assume to be Franzen's political agendas.  I don't appreciate being bombarded by personal ideaologies...it's condescending.  Like other reviewers, I put this author in the category of Tom Wolfe, giving a satirical view of a certain society.  Again, it was OK, not the novel of the decade.
1441866868|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi writes with such vivid detail that one might gasp during some of the more 'shocking' parts of this amazing story. To hear this tale spoken aloud helps bring the listener deep into a surreal world of strange beasts and beautiful creatures like the windup girl, Emiko. Festering diseases like blister rust have made it necessary for engineered foods and living beings to be experimented with and often altered. Windup girls are thought to be the 'wave of the future' by some, but are feared by many who reject this type of 'human evolution'. Many blame profits, bribes and sleezy scientists for the bio-engineered plagues that have taken so many lives. Those who fear and loathe men who tamper with biological innovation will soon do battle with men like Anderson Lake of AgriGen when his love for the windup girl Emiko and his own ambitions will clash on the crazed streets of Bangkok after a bizarre twist of fate. I was in awe of the visual power this author put into his writing, using specific words to capture all of our senses and emotions to fully engulf us in this very unique story!

B001USHRCK|5.0|Medieval Market Village is one of my favorite Lego sets that i own. I bought it here on Amazon for retail price, no taxes, and Prime shipping. This set has so much value. 1600 pieces for the price of only $[...] and great details, minifigs, animals, fruits, fishes, trees, etc. Has awesome play value and you can set up great Medieval scenes. I love how the 2 buildings are fully modular but you can also open them to expand the look and get access to the inside. The buildings designs are remarkable. I love this set and any Lego fan would definitely enjoy :)

B0012CJQY6|4.0|It had been a long time sinced I watched this show, so I decided to refresh my memory. I forgot how raw, rough, and tough this show and Vic was. Michael Chiklis stars as a violent loose cannon cop named Vic Mackey. Vic and his team often perform illegal activities while on duty. There are many other rich characters such as Dutch, Julien, Claudette, Danny, Shane, and Captain David Aceveda who tries to bring down Mackey. Throughout the season, each of the characters have their share of problems as they try to stop murderers, rapists, drug dealers, and much more. I highly recommend THE SHIELD: SEASON ONE!!!

B003EYVXYG|4.0|I heard some bad things about this movie, but I have to say it was a lot better than I was expecting. It was nowhere near as good as his classic trilogy, but it was better than Diary of the Dead. It had pretty Fall scenery and some decent gore scenes. The plot takes place three weeks after the dead return to life. On Plum Island, there are two feuding families. The O'Flynns kill the undead, and the Muldoons want to keep the dead around until a cure is found. A few National Guardsmen reluctantly team up with Patrick O'Flynn and try to survive on the island without running into zombies or Seamus Muldoon. If you love George A. Romero and his zombie movies, you may enjoy SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD!!!
B001TIQT98|4.0|I agree with the vast majority of the comments offered by other reviewers of the great value in this historic, reissued, remastered set, especially with the improvement in sound.  Unless there were unknown factors that prevented their inclusion, the following Mahler/Bernstein/Sony recordings could have been included to make it a complete Bernstein/Sony series (around 7 additional disks):    1)  The Ludwig/Berry orchestral (NYPO) and piano recital (Vienna) versions of \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\".  2)  Mahler song recital (piano) with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.  3)  Jennie Tourel and Janet Baker recordings of the \\"Kindertotenlieder\\" with NYPO and Israel Philharmonic, respectively, plus Tourel's 3 Rueckert and one Wunderhorn song.  4)  Finale of 2nd Symphony (in Hebrew) with Israel Philharmonic, Adagietto from 5th Symphony at RFK's funeral, and 1st movement of 8th Symphony at opening of Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center.  5)  Complete recording of the 2nd Symphony with Armstrong/Baker and the London Symphony.    Can any other missing Sony recordings be added to this list?    I've seen others comment where they lamented the lack of Bernstein recording one of the performing versions of the incomplete 10th Symphony, but he went on record saying that the amount of material beyond the first movement was insufficient to perform, and that others' attempts to \\"complete\\" the symphony didn't represent true Mahler.  I respect that view.  I myself do lament the lack of a recording of \\"Songs of a Wayfarer\\" and \\"Das klagende Lied\\".[[ASIN:B001TIQT98 Mahler: The Complete Symphonies [Box Set]]]
B003PIUBZS|3.0|In all fairness, I should reveal that this review is based on only the first four (4) episodes of the 13 episode series.<br /><br />Truthfully, I had mixed feelings about even watching this DVD set at all, because the reviews I had read were very negative.  However, a couple of friends told me that they really enjoyed the series, so I decided that watching an episode or two wouldn't kill me.<br /><br />First of all, with the exception of the title and the fact that the show deals with Roman gladiators, this SPARTACUS has virtually nothing to do with the 1960 Kirk Douglas classic.<br /><br />The main problem with this series is that it is trying to outdo both GLADIATOR and 300, thus the violence, blood, gore, sex, which is often one step short of pornography, and four-letter words are so numerous and over-the-top that, at times, they are simply laughable.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if that was the producer's intent.<br /><br />I'd also be willing to wager that 90% of this series is shot against a green screen.<br /><br />On the other hand, the plot is rather intriguing and it moves along at a fairly nice clip, so I definitely intend to finish watching this first season relatively soon.<br /><br />As a \\"guilty pleasure,\\" SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND is rather entertaining.<br /><br />From Anchor Bay Entertainment.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000002HMH|2.0|Didn't live up to my expectations. I love the earlier albums, but I feel like they've gone off on a tangent and lost some of what I love about their music. It started with the Black album and continued here. I really hope they get back whatever they lost, this just doesn't get me rockin' like their other albums.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Truthfully, I had never heard of this movie until the night of the Emmy Awards when it won almost every category for which it was nominated.  And, after watching the film, I must say that it certainly deserved every one of them.<br /><br />Claire Danes delivers an amazing performance as the real life autistic woman who has become one of the top scientists in the humane handling of livestock.  Julia Ormond is equally touching as her patient mother, as is Catherine O'Hara, cast as her loving aunt, and David Strathairn, as the high school science teacher who mentors the young woman, encouraging her to use her unique gifts to achieve her goals.<br /><br />TEMPLE GRANDIN is unlike other films that deal with mentally challenged individuals (e.g. RAIN MAN, FORREST GUMP) in that it does not make its central character a comic figure.  Ms. Danes and director Mick Jackson take us into the often-frightening world of the autistic, letting us see (as much as possible) the literal way that they think.<br /><br />Perhaps the most emotionally moving scene takes place at the end of this film when Temple and her mother attend a convention for parents of autistic children.  Observing another mother's frustration with her child's behavior, Temple stands up and explains to the woman and the crowd what it is like to be autistic.  If you haven't been using it already that is the moment where you will definitely need to have your box of Kleenex handy.<br /><br />A short \\"Making of\\" featurette on the DVD gives us the chance to meet the real Temple Grandin.<br /><br />From HBO Video.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B002RKSCA6|4.0|This was another classic book, like the Phantom of the Opera, that I had heard a lot about but never actually sat down and read.  It is a pretty quick read, well written, and fairly disturbing...although maybe not by today's standards.<br /><br />Most of the story is told from the viewpoint of Mr. Utterson, a lawyer who is a friend of Dr. Jekyll's and who observes Dr. Jekyll's strangeness from an outside perspective.  Mr. Utterson has some experience bumping into Mr. Hyde as well and finds Mr. Hyde a most disturbing character.  Most people know the premise behind the story, so the surprise twist at the ending isn't really a surprise.  Basically Mr. Utterson tells you about Dr. Jekyll and how Dr. Jekyll's life is intertwined with the disturbing Mr. Hyde.  Things culminate when Mr. Utterson receives a journal of Dr. Jekyll's that explains Dr. Jekyll's experiment in full.<br /><br />This is a dark, mysterious read.  If would have been full of suspense had I not already known the story.  From Mr. Utterson's point of view the things that happen to Dr. Jekyll and involving Mr. Hyde are disturbing and upsetting.  It isn't until you read Dr. Jekyll's journal, at the end of the book, detailing his experiments that things get very creepy and a bit spooky.<br /><br />As a chemist I have to say that the chemistry described in the book and it's affect on Dr. Jekyll is ridiculous.  I realize this is a work of fiction however and choose to ignore that, although I had to mention it.<br /><br />Stevenson's writing is very readable; and the mystery and gloominess pervading the story is distinct.  The story is very engaging and I found myself hard-pressed to put the novel down.  At times the language is dated and a bit wordy, but I expected that.<br /><br />Overall I am happy that I read this.  It was nice to get the full version of the story and see what all following works were based on.  It is a good piece of literature and an enjoyable read.  Dr. Jekyll's journal at the end brings up some deeper questions about duplicity of personalities and the good and evil that dwells in all humans; so from that aspect it also gives the reader some food for thought.y of personalities and the good and evil that dwells in all humans; so from that aspect it also gives the reader some food for thought.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|For me \\"Raising Sand\\" never quite did it. It seemed to be one type of vibe (or a slight variation here and there)...although I know how hyped that album was I never understood why it was so popular (maybe in the world of Starbucks and Borders, etc.) But \\"Band of Joy\\" goes in all different directions at once...it's got the atmospheric, the rock, the grit, the bop, the folk, and the love song...it's a fine disc and gets better with repeated listening!
0439023483|5.0|For some reason this book grabbed me and didn't let go until the last page.  For me, this book was a cross between [[ASIN:0385732554 The Giver]] and [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] which resulted in this post-apocalyptic scifi adventure involving children who act more like adults than most adults I know.  Although the series takes a turn downhill, you could read just this book and still walk away feeling happy, sad, excited, apprehensive, proud, and disgusted... all at the same time.  Loved it!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|My wife is an occupational therapist, and uses this device as an aid for communicating with her patients in the hospital who are hard of hearing. In a hospital setting, often patients who normally wear hearing aids are often not wearing their hearing aids while in the hospital. My wife takes this device with her as she is making her rounds in the hospital. When she uses it, she puts the headphones on the patient, and pretty much speaks directly into the device's microphone. She says that it works very well - that the patients can hear and understand her well, without her having to yell to them.    I'm not hard of hearing at all, but when I tried using the device, I was AMAZED at how it amplified sounds. If someone 30 feet away turns the page in a book, it sounds like my ear is pressed against the book as the page is turned. It's sort of surreal. I can personally attest that it makes sounds MUCH louder.
0307269752|5.0|After tackling so many heavy political tomes, I was ready for a meaty novel.  \\"Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" was absolutely perfect in this regard, and highly recommended.<br /><br />There are so many reviews already posted that I will limit my comments to these:<br /><br />- My feeling was that the plot and the twists, and the historical/local details were probably what would had resulted had Dan Brown and Edgar Allen Poe collaborated on a best seller. A tip of the hat to Larsson in this regard.<br /><br />- I was constantly surprised by the plot development.  This book is a page turner, plain and simple.<br /><br />- And, the character development matches the plot development ...<br /><br />- It was nice to read a book and realize that all the bad characters and abnormal behavior do not just appear in American-based novels.<br /><br />All in all - an excellent book.
0060936223|4.0|Smith writes with a poet's clear imagery and an economy of words all too rare in the memoir genre.  Before Robert Mapplethorpe died, Patti Smith promised him that she would one day write the story of their years in New York City. Now, twenty years after his death, she has made good on that promise.    This is the story of a beautiful, complex, demanding and ever-evolving friendship between two young, hopeful, actively unconventional creatives. They alternated in the role of muse to each other as they felt their way through the New York City art/poetry/theater/music scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They were struggling to find their special niches and become accepted as artists. In this process they were often also struggling for simple survival. They frequently went hungry and had no place to sleep, all the while bolstering each other's resolve and refusing to give up their dreams.    I never really knew anything about Robert Mapplethorpe aside from a big flap in the 80s about how his work was offensive. Smith writes about him with such tenderness and honesty that I couldn't help weeping when she described his death as a result of AIDS. We should all be so lucky as to have a friend like Patti Smith---a friend who could remember for us our youthful, most hopeful, most vulnerable selves and memorialize us so genuinely.
0307588335|5.0|Very well written history of how Lehman collapsed.

006112429X|1.0|This book was a trashy, overly sensational treatment of what is an intriguing (though disturbing) topic. It could have -- should have -- been a fascinating character study. Instead, it was predictable tripe: closer to a Lifetime movie of the week than serious literature.  None of Shriver's characters felt true. Every last one of them was thoroughly unpleasant and one-dimensional, even the pathetic Celia, who was written as little more than a manipulative plot device. The couple's lack of friends, the husband's apparent mental handicap and the mother's acrid and selfish persona made me wonder about the author herself. I've read The Post Birthday World by Shriver, and I noticed the same bitter miasma seeping through that novel as well. Nasty piece of work. The predictable ending was just absurd. Shriver is a decent writer but there is something unmistakably \\"off\\" about her work -- like the smell of garbage coming through your window on a beautiful day.

1400052173|5.0|When I heard about this book on The New York Times, I knew I had to read it. I am a scientist that works at a cancer hospital and it seemed like a very intriguing book to me. After I was done, I realized it was one of the greatest science non-fiction books I had ever read.    My whole job revolves around informed consent, which is mentioned quite frequently in the book. If Henrietta's cells were never taken without her knowledge, cancer research might not have been as advanced as it is today. I credit Henrietta for my job.     I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a good history lesson as well as several lessons on science, cancer, and cells. You will walk away touched by her family's story as well as in awe by the sheer magnitude of what the HeLa cells have meant to the science world. You'll understand the hardship and sacrifices that occurred in order for us to treat cancer today. It wasn't pleasant the way they treated people in the 50's and 60's but the product is undeniable.
0553805371|4.0|There is little evidence of string theory, it is a hypothesis, that is probably thousands of years away from ever becoming a theory, if ever.  Stephen Hawkins is a proponent of string theory, and I enjoy reading about string theory. The reason this book doesn't get downgraded because of it's use of string theory, to dismiss a subpar system of beliefs that are religion, is because, unlike religion, this book does not proffer certainty.  Like any great scientist, this is simply a hypothesis of how things could have happened, how the world's \\"COULD'VE\\" been made without a God.  I possibility I'm highly open to believing, and a possibility that I think can have several possibilities.  Since, the concept that God created everything, urges the unanswerable question, \\"Who created God?\\"  This could also proffer the belief that whatever created God, created the earth.  Whether Christian or Scientist, at this moment in time, spontaneous creation defines both beliefs.  Unlike religion, he has an explanation for his belief.<br /><br />It is in that explanation that Stephen Hawkins gets four stars for the book.  Well thought out, well written, it details an idea, a hypothesis, into how the world could've come to being made without the help of a superior being.  It is incredibly interesting and uniqely informative.  I've read many pop physics book, and this one is really briliant.

0374158460|5.0|I bought the book because I read somewhere that President Obama had gotten an advance copy and was going to do a vacation read.     Also the reviews of the author were terrific.     Ordered the book in time for vacation intending to read it up in the mountains.     I really enjoyed getting involved in the lives of Patty and Walter Berglund and it left me sad to say goodbye at the end.  I saw my life, I saw the life of my parents and probably the life of their parents.     Very specifically, we have the Freedom to think and do what we want, what we think we need to do at any given moment, the Freedom to believe we are correct in our life choices.    It's interesting that we end up making the same choices and struggling with the same issues ultimately as our parents and their parents did.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|This movie rocks. It closely follows the storyline from the comics with a few slight but not unforgiving changes. The animation is tight and the fight scenes are how die hard fans of the comic envisions them. Nightwing gets some air time and so does Black Mask ( he had me rollin on a few occasions). The voice acting is top notch, even though Mark Hamil's Joker is the stuff of legend the new voice actor has my applause for his graveled creepiness. It reminded me of Heath Ledgers Joker at times.  A surprising thing is the violence, they pulled no punches with this movie. People get taken out, often and in ways you haven't seen in any animated batman series or movies. I hope the creative team that put this together continues with the franchise. If you like Batman your gonna dig this movie.
0143038419|3.0|So I held off on reading this book until now, admittedly because for a really long time I thought it was some kind of trite recipebook/kitchen wisdom-y thing - kitsch, in a word. That turned out to be half true. While it is the author's own recipe of emotional-healing and self-recovery, it feels a little too personal at times. She is undoubtedly a talented and witty writer - the charm literally oozes off the pages. But while the first part of the book really excited my wonderlust and imagination, the story falls flat and becomes a little too self-indulgent. It is the sort of story that I would enjoy telling everyone at a dinner party over and over again, if it were my OWN story and journey, but reading it is like listening to someone who won't stop raving about a fabulous vacation that they didn't have to pay for - at first you're intrigued, and fascinated, and envious. But by the end you can't help but be annoyed and apathetic about someone passing off this grand fairytale.
B002RWKSII|4.0|This is really an enjoyable album, but could be a lot better if the uptempo songs were placed closer to the front of the album.  \\"It's Wonderful\\" should just be left off entirely as it feels completely un-inspired.

B00009TB5G|5.0|When the first film in the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?<br /><br />Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when \\"The Two Towers\\" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.<br /><br />This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (\\"Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!\\" Pippin wails when a \\"tree\\" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.<br /><br />The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" An amazing continuation.cluding the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard.

B00004XSUW|5.0|The years have been far more kind to Taj Mahal's quietly electrifying Columbia solo debut than even his most dedicated listeners might have allowed when it hit the racks in late 1967. (He had earlier released a single for Columbia as the leader of Taj Mahal and the Rising Sons---an interracial band featuring Ry Cooder---but their album didn't appear until Legacy issued the material in 1993.) Two years later, English blues crusader John Mayall would make a kind of fetish out of \\"blues without bashing\\"; Mahal (born Henry St. Clair Fredericks) was playing the blues without bashing before Mayall got the a-ha, and he didn't eliminate a grooving rhythm section to prove it. There's no overdriven guitar schtick, no feedback-frenzied riffing or power chording, no hydraulically exploding drumming, no vocal histrionics. It's a very far cry from the British and American blues acolytes of the time (and even now) who seem to have been using the blues as a stepping stone toward bigger and louder but not very close to better reimaginings of the vintage blues Mahal makes his own.    Mahal here has a fine holler of a voice already, but he's not turning it loose to bludgeon his listeners. He was also perhaps the finest young American slide guitarist before Duane Allman unsheathed his Coricidin bottle at last within a few years, he knitted seamlessly with his then-regular lead guitarist Jesse Ed Davis, and his rhythm section---while not even close to a pyrotechnic power plant---sets a bottom the vaunted Stax and Muscle Shoals rhythm sections would have applauded for what the critic Dave Marsh, speaking explicitly of the latter, called keeping an even keel while cutting the deepest and widest groove they can find.    His take on \\"Statesboro Blues\\" deserved to become the standard take the Allman Brothers Band's take became a few years later; his reimagining of Sleepy John Estes's \\"Diving Duck Blues\\" (from which Muddy Waters borrowed a lyric fragment to help forge his \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\") is practically a textbook exercise in forging blues-rock without letting the rock bury the blues alive; he shuffles the Sonny Boy Williamson chestnut \\"Checkin' Up on My Baby\\" with an aplomb missing from Mayall's horn-riffing take in the same year (to close \\"Crusade\\") and a few extra lyrics, not to mention a soaring harmonica introduction and some very Al Jackson, Jr.-like trap work.    Come to think of it, Mahal is using almost half the album to trumpet Estes, taking on two other Estes numbers, \\"Leaving Trunk\\" (with some fine, dry harmonica work and slice-off-the-husk rhythm guitar) and \\"Everybody's Got to Change Sometime\\" (with a nifty nod to Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor\\" by way of the climb-walking bass lines) as if he found himself with their ownership. Otherwise, he brings about an energetic take on \\"Dust My Broom,\\" giving the writing credit to both Elmore James (who reimagined it most famously in the first place) and Robert Johnson (who wrote it in the first place) and avoiding the slide guitar cliches that have turned the song into an unfortunate dead horse, Mahal and band's restraint absolutely gripping. And, he turns Johnson's \\"Walking Blues\\" into an extension that doesn't lapse into boredom, wringing more emotion out of just a harmonica, an unaccompanied electric guitar (at least, until guest buddy Ry Cooder kind of sneaks in with a sympatico mandolin), and his plaintive husk of a voice for the first two choruses than most reinterpreters could or did with full bands and high volume; when the band eases in, they don't overpower but embrace him.    There's only one original number on the set. And it's a gem---\\"EZ Rider\\" works a soul groove beneath Mahal's rural-fed blues without smothering them. It might have been aimed as a possible single and, if thus released, might have provided a smooth calling card for the album, though even in freewheeling 1967 Mahal's throaty-deep harmonica (almost nodding to Paul Butterfield's from-the-chest style in one or twopassages) might have kept it from being more than a cult hit.    Work like this is what assured Taj Mahal of a long and productive career. But work like this is also why his devotees can't figure out why he has been a cult favourite for the most part while more preening, stylised, self-conscious incendiaries took the gravy his unassuming blues stews deserved. He'd get a lot more adventurous as the years went on, but he rarely got as elementally powerful as this.
0553805371|5.0|Stephen Hawking has always had the ability to explain the complex and often baffling modern physics to the layman, but in this recent work, he has taken it to an even newer level. To a degree, this books overlaps with his much earlier \\"Brief History Of Time\\", but with more focus on the question of the origin and less on, for example, black holes and time travel.<br /><br />The first few chapters are a comparatively easy read, as he explains what a model is in terms of reality, perception, and usability. There are few mind- benders here, although I was surprised to see Hawking state that Ptolemy's world view (Earth at the center of the universe) was NOT wrong. Armed with a good understanding of a model, Hawking then presents the dualism of light and eases into presenting the Unified Theory of Everything. As is tradition with him, he doesn't shy away from mentioning the god principle either. The book ends with a description of the game of life, which frankly had me scratching my head as I tried to make the connection.<br /><br />If it's been a while since your last physics and math classes (as is the case for me), I think you'll like this book. It's well- written, informative, current, and gets you thinking without requiring the hard sciences. If anything, I do find it a little short, and I think some chapters would benefit from expansion. Truly it would be great to have a less \\"dumbed down\\" edition as well, one with actual college- grade math.

B00006FDCJ|1.0|I have seen all of Clint Eastwood's movies and they are all great.  This is the worst of the worst, it is long without enough good content to keep you interested.  The acting sucks, overdone.  Nothing to look forward to or even anticipate! I have seen this movie only once and that is enough.
B003V5PPZG|3.0|Well, I've given the album a chance to sink in and it's about what I expected.  I must say, however, that the album is much shorter than its track listing would have one believe.  There are not 15 songs; instead, you are presented with about nine complete tracks and a handful of interludes consisting of ambient noise and chants.  I found it especially odd and a bit frustrating that the first two tracks alone make up a double-introduction.  There have been comparisons to a Pink Floydian-composition -- an epic, sprawling album that ties together as a cohesive piece.  There are similarities -- the sonar beeps on several tracks (reminiscent of Echoes), the fuzzy interludes that bridge the gaps between tracks, and even a track by the name of \\"Empty Spaces.\\"  But all comparisons aside, A Thousand Suns deserves to be listened to and fully digested to attempt any type of judgement.<br /><br />The first complete track, \\"Burning In The Skies,\\" continues where Minutes To Midnight left off.  It is an electronic ballad and every time I hear it -- not unlike several other tracks here -- I can't help but picture Transformers dancing around in my head.  This is obviously where Linkin Park has settled into as far as a comfort zone goes, but then why am I not satisfied?  Not a bad track -- actually one of the better ones -- but it still feels a bit incomplete to me.<br /><br />Another interlude...yes, three of the first four tracks are interludes...ugh.  Nothing even happens in this one -- it's eighteen freakin' seconds long for crying out loud!  Really?!  Guns and battle cries now emit the vibe of a war/anti-war theme...<br /><br />\\"When They Come For Me\\" is actually pretty tight and it is a relief to hear Mike Shinoda rock the mic.  Remember when this happened in every song?  Yeah, I barely do either.  Good tune though with a sick Eastern feel to it.  \\"Robot Boy\\" begins with and carries on with a familiar tune playing in the background.  Is that piano channeling T.I.'s \\"What You Know\\" in the background?  Maybe it's just me, but I can't help but picture Mr. Hahn and T.I. doing body shots off pole strippers when I hear this.  I can't really even decide if I like this one or not because I am now too distracted by the thought of dancing strippers.  While it has an epic feel and continues with the aforementioned Eastern-vibe, it is a pretty chill track and won't incite any riots; curb your enthusiasm please.<br /><br />Another interlude and sonar beeping...<br /><br />Ok, in my opinion, here is where the album truly takes off -- three bare-knuckle tracks that will even turn heads from the non-believers and those who had given up hope for LP.  \\"Waiting For The End\\" -- what to say about this one...I love it.  Yes, it becomes quite sugar-coated after a promising start, but I can't help but sing along with it every time it plays.  The verses have a Gorillaz feel to them -- think Plastic Beach -- before taking off into one of Linkin Park's most satisfying chorus's in recent memory.  I don't think this could be prevented from reaching mainstream radio if the studio themselves refused to release it.  \\"Blackout\\" is even better.  While it may not be the best, or even my favorite track (then again, maybe it is), it flat out kicks @$$ and could have passed as a Fragile-era Trent Reznor production.  It is also notable that Chester does release his blood-curdling scream (yes kids, a tiny taste of Hybrid Theory!) between staccato-laced verses on \\"Blackout.\\"  \\"Wretched And Kings\\" is a grimy hip-hop track with a reggae tinge, reminiscent of a Public Enemy joint and actually closely resembles the sound the band captured during the Meteora-era...solid track.<br /><br />You guessed it (interlude).<br /><br />\\"Iridescent.\\"  Hmm...I don't particularly care for this one.  Shinoda and Chester singing a boring ballad that could've been a Minutes to Midnight outtake?  No thanks.<br /><br />Another interlude brings us into the lead single, \\"The Catalyst.\\"  You love it, youhate it, or you just don't know about it.  I fit into the latter category.  Even after hearing it twenty or so times, I just don't know if I like it.  I don't go out of my way to change the radio station when it's on, but I'll skip it on my iPod in a flash, so take that with a grain of salt.  Certainly not the best track here, so hopefully that still gives hope to those timid of the \\"new\\" sound.<br /><br />The album closes with \\"The Messenger,\\" another ballad that recalls Chester's time spent with his first band, Grey Daze (check out \\"Soul Song\\").  It is a fitting, yet solemn close to an album that strives to break new ground and while they may indeed reach this coveted ground, it is not yet broken.  Is the album better than Minutes To Midnight?  Yes.  Much better?  No.  At least on A Thousand Suns, they get away from the U2-esque sound and move in a slightly new direction.  It is a step in the RIGHT direction, but I hope they continue to develop an edgier-industrial (e.g., \\"Blackout\\") sound moving forward (someone has to at least try and succeed Reznor, right?), though I won't hold my breath on that.  To call this album or any other LP album for that matter genre-breaking is a bit of a reach, even if there aren't many bands that can replicate their ability to compose music from clouds of static.  But I'll give them credit -- when you hear Linkin Park, there's no mistaking them for anyone else.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Blackout<br />Waiting For The End<br />Wretched And Kings<br />When They Come For Me<br />Burning In The Skiesr category.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|If you're into \\"realistic\\" dystopian films about the end of the world, I'd highly recommend Children of Men.  I enjoy movies that portray the world's demise in what could actually occur as the result of a catastrophic incident.    What I like most about this film is that it doesn't really try to explain the reason's why women can't have children, but instead, follows the protagonist to show viewers how he copes with his problems and newfound situation.  The movie was also shot in a type of \\"documentary style\\" filming (though not all-out like District 9,\\" which makes for some unique cinematography.
B002ZFQD04|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I am a M-donna fan. I have been for 22 years. But watching this dvd I kept asking myself - WTF????<br />First and foremost is the concert live or playback? The sound is so polished that you have a feeling that you listen to pre-recorded songs, not live tracks. My opinion is shared by my friend, with whom I watched the concert.<br />Of course, during such tunes as \\"Like a virgin\\" (quite moving moment) or \\"You must love me/Don't cry for me...\\" she sings live, but during other songs everybody will doubt.<br />She jumps, she runs, she makes a lot of commotion, but her voice doesn't tremble. It is visible the most in the closing song. If you look closely, you can see her taking a breath one moment, when in fact you can hear her singing.<br />So...Judge for yourself, but I miss old Madonna, singing not clean here and there...<br /><br />The choice of songs. Not bad. What I like in Madonna concerts is the constant reinvention. The versions she plays are different to those known from cd-s.<br /><br />Quality of picture...Whoever edited this concert, should be punished severly. After first 40 minutes my eyes were so tired, that we had to take a break. Where are the times of Confessions tour where I couldn't stop watching the dvd, because it was soooo luring ;(<br /><br />As I mentioned in the title, I give the third star for the short documentary. It is quite interesting to see all the things that happen behind the \\"close door\\":)<br /><br />In general, I regret a bit purchasing this dvd. I expected some more...live...
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like these workouts because they are fairly quick, yet you really feel you've worked your muscles when you're done. This is not just cardio, so you don't just feel winded at the end. Probably the most satisfying workout video I've ever seen in this respect.    Downsides: The production is annoying because 1) The soundtrack is a dreadful, cheap electronic beat 2) Jillian is so annoying to listen to when you consider you do the workouts more than once. How many times do I have to hear her say \\"Don't phone this one in, guys\\". 3) One of the backup exercisers can be seen resting when she thinks the camera is not on her anymore. 4) Jillian wimps out way too much by starting each exercise then quickly stopping to walk over to each helper and explaining their form as they do it. Again, the 1st time through the video is ok, but over and over again gets really annoying....especially when it's obvious she's just doing it so she doesn't get tired out.    Bottom line is, if you turn the volume all the way down for repeat sessions, you'll be able to bear the annoyances. Personally I turn it all the way down, and crank my stereo with good workout music, then just keep an eye on the TV for when the exercises change.

B003V5PPZG|4.0|First off, I'd like to say that I give Linkin Park a bunch of credit for having the cajones to continuously evolve and change their sound for nearly every album.  Their work, taken as a whole, represents a broad range of musical art.  That being said, the fact that several years pass between albums dictate that each album be evaluated as a stand-alone entity.    That being said.....    1. The Requiem: Intro tracks seem to be en vogue with LP.  As intro tracks go, this is pretty good.   7/10    2. The Radiance: a second intro track, essentially.  Could easily be merged into Requiem, not entirely necessary.  2/10    3. Burning in the Skies: a good example of LP's evolving sound.  Great mix of old and new.  Chester's/Mike's melodic singing is top notch.  Great song.  10/10    4. Empty Spaces: another interlude? why?      5. When They Come for Me: Awesome song.  Sounds a bit like the Xero/Hybrid Theory days with a desperate, post apocalyptic twist.  10/10    6. Robot Boy:  Decent song with good musical backing, but overall somewhat forgettable.  6/10    7. Jordana del Muerto: ooohh, an interlude is ostensibly another language. 4/10    8. Waiting for the End: The song starts with such promise.  Mike's raps sounds like a mix of Bob Marley and his Fort Minor experiment.  A promising song that leaves me waiting for it to be taken to the next level.  Sadly it doesn't get there.  6/10    9.  Blackout:  Sheer rage written into music.  Chester's crazy vocals set this track apart.  9/10    10. Wretches and Kings:  The requisite political song; much in the vein of Minutes to Midnight's No More Sorrow.  Great evolution of old LP's sound.  10/10    11. Wisdom, Justice, and Love: yet another interlude, but one with a message.  4/10    12. Iridescent: a largely forgettable melodic track.  Mike and Chester can sing this way, but they're at their best when they don't.  4/10    13. Fallout:  interlude, but with some neat remixed sounds from Burning in the Skies.  This is getting a little old.  4/10    14. The Catalyst: good song that shows the changes LP had made over time.  Good lyrics, although they're repetitive.  8.5/10    15. The Messenger: wow.  At first I wanted to laugh, because the thought of Chester singing (sometimes aggressively) with an acoustic backing was ludicrous.  And it kind of is.  I love Chester's voice, but this style isn't for him.   3/10
0375831002|5.0|This book will be our  next book club choice.  It will be interesting to see how all the over 50 year old women in the group feel about this book.   I must confess that I had read it before, probably 4 to 5 years ago so I decided I better read it again.  What I remembered was that I really liked it, but not much more.  Surprising to me is that for a book I liked I did not remember specific details from the book.  It felt as if I was reading it again for the 1st time. Pondering on this I decided it wasn't the entire story that struck a chord with me but the ending.  And what an ending it was! I still think it is a 5 star for me.  I do like the visual language the author uses and found his use of word choices enjoyable.

0374158460|5.0|The quest for limitless freedom is a common theme in literature -- from Jack Kerouac's character in On the Road to George Clooney's connectionless corporate downsizer in Up In The Air  (via Walter Kirn's novel). Just about every red-blooded American has fantasized about the attractiveness of no attachments, of total privilege to do whatever is wanted whenever. But, as Jonathan Franzen explains in one of the more profound passages in his brilliant new novel Freedom: \\"The personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality also prone, should that dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage.\\"<br /><br />And so what we have here is 550 immensely readable pages devoted to the idea of exploring the limits of freedom within the context of oft-damaged and then re-mended relationships between a family and one particular friend. At what point does one person's freedom infringe upon another's? And at that point, is freedom still freedom? Indeed, these questions have fluid, multi-hued answers, especially as time passes and relationships change. But one thing about this book is clear: Many years from now, this novel will no doubt be cited as the prime example of the Franzen oeuvre: stories about families that aren't so much dysfunctional as problem-heavy.<br /><br />And liberal environmentalist Walter Berglund, his wife Patty, and their long-time musician friend Richard Katz, are certainly besought with problems; but these problems are generally a result of their own poor choices, and the resulting secrets. In fact, another question the novel poses is to what degree do families have freedom to keep secrets from each other?<br /><br />That question and the delicious conflict it creates is what makes the meat of the novel -- and what makes it un-putdownable. Will these secrets be revealed, and if so, how will the revelation effect the characters' relationships? Franzen is a master at rendering these relationships -- the ebb and flow, the who-needs-whom-more dynamic, the power struggles. Walter and Patty's marriage is the cornerstone of the novel, but how they both relate to Richard provides the intrigue. Walter and Patty's children, Jessica and Joey also flit in and out of the novel, often playing key roles in the side-taking and blame game when things go awry. And their stories are interesting in and of themselves -- from the moment teenage Joey tests the limits of his own freedom by moving out of his home to his next-door neighbors'.<br /><br />So Freedom is highly recommended. It's a long book, yes, but very readable -- Franzen's prose flows effortlessly. He's just a joy to read. (By the way, see below for one of my favorite sentences of all time.) But in order to \\"limit\\" this novel to 550 pages, Franzen has to spend vast swaths of pages in summary -- the one part of the novel, though minor, that was irritating. Just tell me the story, I thought. I'd happily read another 500 pages of this! Also, isn't it sort of clunky to write an entire novel that plumbs the limits of freedom, and then title it \\"Freedom\\"? Again, a minor annoyance. So I'd subtract a half a star from my rating: 4.5 out of 5 (but I'm entering 5 here to even out the morons who've given Freedom one star to idiotically protest e-book pricing). This is top-shelf contemporary literature. Enjoy it!<br /><br />Near-perfect sentence: \\"He'd lost his good looks, or, more precisely, they had shrunk into a small facial oasis in a desert of sunburned bloat.\\"es.

B002GYI9C4|4.0|I read these books on the request of my wife, who loved the Mistborn series, and now places it as one of her all-time favorite book series. I had been invested in another series and needed a break from it, to try something different, so I picked up Mistborn. I'm writing this after having read all three books.    This is the first of a trilogy that follows Vin, a poor street girl from the slums who has barely survived. She comes to learn she has extraordinary powers, and learns from Kelsier, another of the books main characters how to use her power. The book defines a Bad Guy, the emperor: Lord Ruler and his minions, the Good guys: Kelsier's Crew, and the Unknown: The Mist. These elements all set the Base for the entire series.    The series has a wonderful and refreshing approach to \\"magic\\" in that its not some inane ability, but is a genetic ability that is only activated during a traumatic event. The ability itself is using metals that give people specific abilities. This plays into the plot as does almost every other detail revealed in the series. Every race of people, place, religion, and history all come into play, and makes the series very detailed. The downside to this detail is everything gets defined at some point, and causes the series as a whole to feel less epic, and the world a little small.    I didn't find any major plot twists or significant moments that made me feel \\"that's just wrong\\", as other books do with the fine line morality and survival. This overall is a PG/PG-13 style book that is a fun, easy to follow read that is very enjoyable, but not quit epic.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|WARNING:  may contain spoilers!    FYI:  I'm reviewing strictly as a viewer of the series.  I've never read the books upon which the series is based.    Vampire stories, films, and series have been done, re-done, overdone and underdone, for a good long while. A lifelong fan of the genre, I've made peace with the reality that a certain amount of repetition is inevitable in paranormal dramas.  \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" revisits many devices common to vampire fiction: Good Vampire Brother versus Evil Vampire Brother; Present Day Love Interest has identical looks to Vampire's former, long-lost love; Evil Pyschopath Vampire Brother may not be quite so evil as he seems.      Despite these \\"been there, done that\\" plot devices, \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" earns its place as an entertaining, memorable series.  The show manages to reinvent the devices and make them its own. Multi-dimensional characters, great acting and excellent continuity contribute to a compelling viewing experience.    The series unfolds like a great book that starts out a tad slow and takes a while to build up to the \\"good stuff\\" only to sweep its readers away through a fantastic read.  Patient viewers will appreciate \\"Vampire Diaries\\" for taking the time to \\"tell the whole story.\\" Many of the early episodes introduce a lot of information and character development that enhance the later episodes.     After avoiding \\"Twilight's\\" appalling mediocrity, I was reluctant to view a new teen paranormal series. I'm pleasantly surprised.  I like that Elena is an ordinary person (not a \\"slayer\\" or other \\"special\\" person/creature,) but she isn't the chronic \\"Oh I am nobody without my vampire boyfriend!\\" type.  She does not depend on vampire muscle to save the day, and has definitely done her part to save the day for vampires sometimes.    The one disappointment I have for this series is the casual portrayal of and/or mention of teen indulgence in alcohol, substance abuse, and premarital sex. It's not a moral issue in my mindso much as pathetic to see all these \\"good\\" teens getting drunk/wasted (or talking about getting drunk/wasted) or having sex pretty casually. Just because it might be \\"real\\" doesn't mean I want to see it, especially if it's not relevant to the storyline.    Fasinating secondary characters and storylines have emerged in this series. Jeremy and Anna's storyline is particularly touching. The writers manage to mix so many issues -- grief/bereavement, child abuse, child neglect, divorced families, classism -- into their storytelling.  Never a dull moment.  Numerous vampire citizens and guests reveal facets of a fascinating culture all their own. Interesting, for example, vampires don't seem hung up on race concerns.    Finally, I really applaud the producers for featuring \\"Vampire Diaries\\" in a small, Southern town and not featuring a ton of \\"hillbilly\\" stereotypes and people talking with drawling accents that have become so typical of any Southern town portrayal.  \\"Vampire Diaries\\" introduces very believeable people, even the paranormal ones.    Well worth a look.

Spoilers coming..................                                  *He accidentally kills someone who did not deserve it    *He kills a woman (she did deserve it--I'm just saying....)    *Another serial killer is on the loose    *His sister is edging closer and closer to Dexter's origins    *There is an absolutely horrific ending that will shock everyone even as it shocks Dexter to the core.    The cast is still great, the stories still compelling, and the blood is running freely.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I am an avid FPS gamer and a musician.  Therefore I am an audiophile on top of loving to play video games.  That being said, I bought these to replace my Tritton Ax720 Pros (Turtle Beach was cheaper.) and found them to be lacking.  They rattle loudly even when the bass is turned down.  The surround sound is also very poor in that you cannot tell where anyone is coming from.  I would not recommend these if you want quality gaming sound.

B002QGUFWE|1.0|Can I give this a zero? A one is too good for this. I like how people believe she was so original and outrageous for wearing the meat dress at the VMA's. What a joke! The Beatles did the \\"meat wearing\\" stunt years ago for their \\"Yesterday and Today\\" butcher cover photo. She's a moron and a ripoff.  'nuff said.
0802798225|3.0|I picked up this book on a whim one day while browsing Borders, without reading any reviews, something I rarely do nowadays. I kept putting it off until last weekend when I was on my contemporary young adult high and all I felt in the mood for to read was contemporary young adult. While I enjoyed Perfect Chemistry overall, I wasn't... what's the word... impressed by it.<br /><br />It's a plot we've all seen and read before: a guy (here we have Alex, a sexy Latino gangbanger) from the wrong side of the tracks falls for the rich, popular cheerleader, Brittany, who had a not-so-nice boyfriend. I liked Alex more than Brittany as he had more of a personality. To me, Brittany was just bland. The book is told by Alex and Brittany through alternating first-person point of view but it took a while for their individual voices to shine through--for many chapters, without the help of character names, it could've been either Brittany or Alex \\"talking\\" as I couldn't tell their voices apart. As for the romance between Alex and Brittany, it's okay but the ending was just a little too perfect even for my romantic sensibilities.<br /><br />The parts I enjoyed the most in this book were the friendships: Alex and his best friend Paco, the friendship that began between Brittany and Isa (a girl from Alex's \\"world\\") and Brittany's friendship with her best friend Sierra. I also liked the Latin flavor the author incorporated in the book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a light, teenage escapism read and enjoy the West Side Story/forbidden love plot with plenty of cliche family drama, boyfriend drama and school drama, this is your book. Twilight fans needing a break from paranormals are sure to eat this book up. 3 out of 5 stars
B001AKTZO6|5.0|It's been said a million times already, and truthtully all I'm doing is repeating what's already been said by bigger and better people- Creedence Clearwater Revival is truly unique in every sense of the word.    Something must have been seriously wrong with me when I was younger, because \\"Born on the Bayou\\" never seemed particularly appealing to me back in the day.  NOW however, I realize the error of my ways.  Whatever it was I was smoking back then, the fact remains I definitely wasn't thinking or hearing very clearly because this is one HECK of an awesome tune.  Best verse melody ever.    \\"Bootleg\\" is an extremely melodic little roots rock tune.  A perfect song really.  At least, a perfect example of what makes CCR so darn irresistible.    Some people have a problem with \\"Graveyard Train\\" because, to be honest, the verse melody is somewhat mindless.  It sounds extremely simple, however, that's exactly why I love it so much.  It's catchy, and the harmonica jam that appears later on is really good as well.  An underrated track.  Its only flaw is being 8 minutes long because it honestly only deserves to be about 4 or 5 minutes.    Would you like to hear solid proof that todays guitar players can't hold a candle to the older ones?  Just listen to the guitar playing in \\"Penthouse Pauper\\".  Upon hearing it, you can definitely tell it's stuck in the late 60's because a bunch of blues rock bands like Cream and Zeppelin were writing songs with similar implementation of the guitar work, however it's also distinctive enough to stand head and shoulders above most guitar rock of todays generation.    We all know \\"Proud Mary\\" to the point of memorization so there's no need to further explain its awesomeness, and the album closes with the very best song- \\"Keep On Chooglin\\".  BRILLIANT guitar jam, BRILLIANT harmonica work, and BRILLIANT rhythm section.  Seriously, it's perfect.      Creedence Clearwater Revival is an incredible band and there's a reason people still listen to them today.  There's a reason radio stations still play their classic material.  Bayou Country covers all the bands very best points and offers some underrated ones as well.
0525423842|3.0|ending.  Despite this I have to confess that I really enjoyed this book.  It plays out easily and while predictable it is a good read, especially for young adults.  Theo is perhaps a bit too smooth and uber-confident but one can let that slip. The tragedy of this book is it has no ending. I did not buy a hard copy but rather had it on my Kindle and I confess that I thought it had downloaded improperly.  No joke.  The ending was so sudden and unexpected, it was less of a cliff-hanger than as if one were watching a 1970's TV epispode only to have it cut at the end with the words \\"to be continued\\" flashing along the bottom. Yes, I will probably read the sure to be released sequal but I do feel a bit ill-used after not getting the whole story in one book.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|I have just finished reading Jonathan Franzen's Freedom and I wonder if anyone else sees beyond the obvious narrative about the Berglund family to American society and the unraveling of the fabric which unites us.  While the subjects themselves, Patty, Walter, and their children, Joey and Jessica are believable and their situations recognizable, the larger issue for me was how they were gradually compromising their beliefs because of external pressure which impinged on their individual freedom.  It makes one wonder how deep-seated these values were to be so easily abandoned, but then asks the question, isn't this the problem we are facing today?     When children begin to question their parent's authority, as Joey Berglund does in the opening of Freedom, is this the beginning of the end?  It shouldn't be, but are modern parents afraid of their progeny and caving in instead of sticking to their guns and enforcing the rules?  Is this where the meaning of freedom meets its first test and do the Berglunds or more to the point, do we as a society, pass or fail that test may be the heart of the meaning of this narrative?  Are we abdicating our responsibility and allowing others to do the same and creating a situation where anarchy will follow because there are no adults left?  Where are the principled among us who will give up personal freedom for the general welfare?    Some of the questions raised by Franzen, I believe, ask the questions: Are things becoming black and white?  What happened to the gray areas where dialog occurred and compromise took place?  Is this option lost or can we reclaim our moderate selves?  Are our individual freedoms more important than \\"...promot[ing] the general welfare, and secur[ing] the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity...\\" as set forth by our forefathers in the Preamble to our Constitution? Is anything more important than the individual, another person, the world, the future of our planet? Or has it become the case thatit is everyman for himself?    Our freedoms seem to infringe as well as liberate us and cause us to resent the way others view and practice these freedoms to our dismay and discomfort. Neighbor versus neighbor, as in Malloy v. Berglund improving my house is more important that your need for peace and quiet and later, Hauffbauer v. Berglund my pet's right to roam free, hunting and killing birds for sport is more important than some birds I don't know or care about. Or as  Coyle Mathis, the Westvirginian v. Vin Haven,a wealthy and well connected, bird lover, objecting to let's save a bird and in the process, destroy a town, a mountain, an ecosystem, because I have the money and access to power and you don't? Is Freedom a microcosm of society and its intolerance, and our accommodation to get what we want without asking \\"who is paying for this?\\"  Or is it a declaration of independence to do or not do what we please, consequences be damned?      I find this book to be a parable with a lesson and if we merely see it as just a good, well crafted fiction, I believe we miss the point.  It can be viewed as a cautionary tale in which we look into the abyss and turn away chastened and mend our ways, or we can dismiss it as just a liberal rant about spoiled rich people who as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in The Great Gatsby, \\"are not like you and me.\\"  And is Richard Katz as the homewrecker an heir of Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby nee Gatz in the reckless exercise of his freedom to love 'em and leave 'em?  Who is responsible for the destruction of a marriage, just the couple or are third parties culpable as well?  You can't help who you love, or can you?     The novel is about many things, marriage, family, friendship, neighbors, government, greed, corruption, deception, depression, betrayal, all of which depend on the way one's individual freedom interfaces with the freedom of those with whom we interact.  These freedoms weigh heavily on those who bother to examine their motivation andlightly on those who seek to advance their cause for personal gain.  But the conundrum caused by the exercise of personal freedom arises when both sides are right but in opposition.  How do we just learn to live together and respect the right to disagree without becoming disagreeable.    I believe Franzen has presented a case for discussing this freedom which so many take for granted and abuse to get their way.  We should be examining our motives in relation to the rights and freedom of others.  Do we even use the words \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" when we make a choice?  Or have we bought into the hedonism of \\"if it feels good do it\\" philosophy?      Franzen has turned the camera on us and what he has captured is far from fiction, it is real life.  How do you like it?
B0019KC4TK|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums, from the time I bought it when it first came out on vinyl through wearing out several albums and CD's over the years. I didn't really think this was going to offer much new and especially not improved, but I bought it anyway. Well, I was in for a surprise, as the mixes are outstanding and make listening to this an adventure all over again.<br /><br />There are two discs in this set, one a DVD/Audio with both DTS 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 mixes, then a SACD with DSD multi-channel. Each mix is different, the Dolby being heavier on bass (and a little muddled, truthfully), the DTS doing more with discrete instruments on each channel, and the DSD more like the original. I've listened through each once now, and the DTS is what I like best and what I'll probably listen to most of the time, although purists would probably like the DSD best. Actually, purists probably won't like this at all...<br /><br />If you've never heard the album, it's unique in the Genesis catalogue, more in the classical rock veins of EL&P or even Uriah Heep, and having very little of the pop elements of later Genesis work. (BTW, it's not a \\"clean\\" recording, and the sound quality is like something second generation, and always has been. But it doesn't matter.) It's a true masterpiece that defines the 70's for me.
B000XT1P3E|3.0|This movie was fantastic, however the seller I purchased from was incredibly slow and when my product did actually arrive 3 weeks later, it was in a crappy plastic bag and the case was broken. Luckily the DVD inside was fine, but this was not the quality I expected. Especially when I noticed a few days after purchasing the item that I could've purchased it new for much cheaper at a local store. The movie is fantastic though, I love Julia Roberts and she shines in Erin Brockovich.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This irresistible new Disney animation featuring New Orleans Jazz music and the hard-working modern-day princess who is also a gifted chef is appealing to both girls and boys - it is about two transformative frogs'(Tiana & prince Noveen) journey through adventures, friendship and love of a lifetime. As the romance rises from the sea made musical by Louis the Alligator to the pair of twinkling stars brightening up the night sky from the loss of Ray the Firefly, this film has non-stop fascinating and dramatic scenes for the whole family. (Some parents are worried about the Voodoo part of the film. It seems like its presence is to provide enhanced suspense for plot development like other \\"dark forces\\" in its peer princess movies and it is controlled enough not to really scare little ones.)<br /><br />Studio & details: Walt Disney Studios,2010, 98 min, G
044654759X|1.0|I almost hated this book. Predicable and the ending is stupid.  Sleeping with the Enemy has already been a movie.  It's not his traditional love story at all.  I made myself finish it, but it goes next to At First Sight and True Believer...at the END of my favorite list.  I LOVE Sparks, but he can do better.
0553582038|1.0|Oh what drivel.    This fourth in the series goes on and on and on, with no resolution of anything and most of the interesting characters missing.    I've made three attempts to finish this long-winded book of drivel and stopped midway through every time. I finally gave the book to my rabbits to eat (they enjoy a good book!)    The first three books were phenomenal. Fast paced and filled with character-driven plot and intrigue. The fourth one is nothing more than a long book written to take as much money from Martin's fans as possible.    Did I say, total drivel?
B003HARV3Y|2.0|Imagine the first Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, without mentions of He Who Must Not Be Named, Draco, or Dumbledore. Oh, and where Harry is played by a college-aged man, Hermione is even older, and Ron is a wise-cracking hipster. Imagine if that first movie did nothing to set up the plot for the following movies.  If you can imagine what a mess that would have made of the Harry Potter series of movies, then you can just about imagine what this travesty of a screenplay did to the plot of Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightening Thief.  So much is changed from the book that Craig Titley, the screenwriter, should have just penned his own original script and left the film adaptation of Rick Riodan's very enjoyable Juvenile novel to someone who cared about the book and its fans. As for the casting of adults instead of children for these roles, I just don't get it. Chris Columbus did such a masterful job of staying true to the Harry Potter books. What a disappointment that he decided to completely ignore the book with this film. Perhaps he wanted to use his artistic license. If so, his license should be revoked. And shame on Rick Riodan for allowing it to happen.    If you haven't read the book, then you might enjoy the movie for the special effects. If you read and loved the book, you'll likely be disappointed in this film. I don't know if they're planning on making films of the other books in the series. I do know I won't be watching them if they do.
B003Z6QGGS|3.0|Anxiously I awaited the Kindle version of Dave Mustaine's biography, but area-specific constraints prevented me from ordering the original \\"A Heavy Metal Memoire\\" version which was released in august in the United States. Therefor I had to wait for the European release, on September 16. On the day itself, I finally got the book in my Kindle application on the iPad, but it really is the bare minimal version. They didn't even include the photograph on the cover, and it looks like there are no photos on the inside either (which I suspect will be in the paper-version).    I haven't read the book itself yet, but if publishers want to make the digital versions more attractive, they shouldn't offer such a stripped-down version.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great show.  I am so sad that it is over.    Wish it had more of a chance as I think it could have been a great one.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I took my young son to see this movie and he absolutely loved it! I didn't think he would sit that long or maybe fall asleep but the music and the magic kept him watching. There were a few scary parts, but I assured him it was only make believe. He still remembers the movie after all this time. He calls it \\"A Princess and Two Frogs!\\"    Disney has outdone themselves and I believe it has quickly become a family favorite.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the Hunger Games and the second book was enjoyable as well.  However, the third installment makes a departure from worked so well with the first two books.  The protagonist becomes a \\"Public Relations\\" character and deals with internal struggles.  The drama and intense excitement of the arena was missing.  The overall tone of the novel was depressing and the ending literally made me wince.  With that said, please feel free to complete the series, but don't expect the brilliance of the first novel.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis star in Tony Scott's 1986 action drama.  A navy fighter pilot romances an instructor and loses his best friend   in an accident. This is definitely one of Tom's best and this 2-disc   set has nice picture and sound plus cool extras. I highly recommend   this 80's classic.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|I just want to say I'm reviewing the movie itself here, not the DVD or Blu-ray since they are not yet released at the time of this writing, nor will I buy or rent the home video version of this stinker. I saw \\"Predators\\" on the Sunday night of it's opening weekend back in July and the stench of this lousy movie is still fresh in my mind. The original Predator is a terrific sci-fi action thriller. It's loud and dumb and full of macho dudes with huge guns tearing up the jungle. No one has ever mistaken Predator for an intelligent film. At the same time, Arnold's action vehicle remains one of the most emimently watchable pieces of pop culture cinema from the 1980s. It's been 23 long years since the first flick came out and I can't count how many times I've seen the film because it's really fun and easy to watch. Memorable location photography, fun characters, intense action and one great villian from outer space. Not that the first film was in any way original or groundbreaking, it was billed as \\"Rambo\\" meets \\"Alien\\". That's how it was sold and it worked like magic even though the critics mostly panned it. A lot of kids grew up on that movie, including me. Well those kids are now making movies of their own and here comes \\"Predators\\", the hamfisted quasi-remake-sequel thing to the original classic sci-fi monster movie. The people behind this new movie have probably immersed themselves in the Predator movies, videogames and comic books. Appearantly nothing good has come of it, because this movie plays like a endless in-joke between fans of the series. It has zero integrity or ideas of it's own.    I saw the trailers to Predators and I was enthusiastic about it. Depressed over the miserable Predator 2 with Danny Glover and absolutely disgusted by how pathetic the Alien vs Predator flicks were, I had some hope that the filmmakers were finally ready to set things right. Robert Rodriguez was involved, not as director, but that's ok. The director was Nimrod Antal and he did the effective little movie \\"Vacancy\\". The trailers were terrific. The Predators kidnap a bunch of human mercenaries and assassins, take them to the Predator home planet and hunt them on that turf. Great set up! Plus we finally get a jungle/forest atmosphere instead of L.A. or Antarctica ( ridiculous ).    I was going to go see this new film with a friend but I found out he had never seen the original movie! Yes, there are still men out there who have not seen that absolute essential classic of macho cinema. We rented the original movie the night before and watched it. Everyone was entertained, even me who has seen it countless times before. Then the next night, we head off to the movie theater. Talk about deja vu. There are entire sequences lifted from the original. Beyond the return of the memorable score, ( which I didn't mind at all ), there was that waterfall scene all over again, there was the Billy makes a stand scene regurgitated with a Yakuza gangster. It went on and on. The big ideas of this insipid film were things like C.G.I. Predator dogs, two different Predator races and Laurence Fishburne in a pointless cameo apperance.    The cast was in no way memorable. Adrien Brody does a lot of grunting but seeing him go toe to toe with the biggest, meanest, toughest alien was silly. Even Arnold was wiped out but Brody can handle things? Absurd nonsense. The other characters had little to no personality. Compare this lame squad with the likes of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Sonny Landham. And what about the chick with the big gun ( Alice Braga )? Does every action film need a chick with a gun? Finally... Topher Grace, the dork from \\"That 70s Show\\", doing his annoying schtick yet again. It's all a bit too much. The writing is subpar to say the least, the dramatic tension that one so desperately needs in a sci-fi thriller is completely non-existent. I didn't care about the fate of any character in the entire movie. The Predator mythology is barely expanded at all, we just find out that there is more than one race of predators and that they are at war with each other. Nothing more about the planet, it's history or anything. Brody just tells the audience, \\"This planet is a game reserve and we're the game.\\" How does he know that? How did he figure that out in 15 minutes after just waking up in a sky diving freefall? Well, he doesn't know jack, it's just the poor mechanics of the screenplay that are working themselves out to give the audience information.    I could go on and trash this hapless film for all it's worth as a way of retribution for getting me into the movie theater and taking my money but I'll leave things on a good note. This movie is much better than the awful Alien vs Predator movies. At the same time, never did I imagine that I would actually think of Predator 2 as a decent film but man, that stupid sequel from 1990 is light years ahead of Predators. That sequel embellished the mythology, pumped up the action and the violence and had crazy Gary Busey, wild man Bill Paxton and of course Danny Glover.     Predators is a poor sequel and does nothing to add to the mystery of this venerable movie monster. It's a decent little midnight movie when you're alone at home with nothing to do before going to bed. That's the best I can say about it. I wish it was much better but it can't be when money and exploiting a lucrative property are the sole motives for this film's existence.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I tore through all three books back to back and even though the story line in confusing at times and the pace can be slow, I cant help but feel empathy for Liz and her upbringing.<br /><br />This is not a book for young people as the issues and sexual abuse are probably beyond understanding (hopefully).  This was a great series for a summer read but I am disappointed that Stieg was not able to finish the other 7 in the series.

B002JVWRAO|4.0|Kripke had a plan to end the series at this season, and you can see that in the season finale.  Then they made him extend the show and stuff was added so that the show could conitnue.

Sam has made a heartbreaking sacrifice; Dean lives his life as  family man.<br /><br />The End.
0439023513|2.0|This is dedicated to all who are now mourning the victims of the Hunger Games -    Dearest Katniss - We walked with you, talked with you, sang with you, pained with you.     You are a hero of such uncommon nature -  a willing sacrifice for family, and a noble sacrifice for friends.  You approached the future with a chin held high, and grit that would sustain you.  But how did you do it?  You know that you had all of the odds against you.  When you were in the palm of destruction, how did your soul wake up to face another day?  We know.  We've been there.  You just do it.  You grimace, you apply salve to the wounds, and you just do it.  We endured with you, because we know it must be done.  Loved ones expect it.  Life demands it.      Like you, we too have songs that find a way from our lips.  They find a note, and a voice, because the earth may shake, and the sky may rumble, but like you, we know that these things will not still our hearts.  And yet we sing, and defy the cloudy weight of worry.  Thank you for singing the songs of our souls.  Songs that indeed are there, and now have been carried by you to the hearts of those in need.    Rough on the edges, but hiding goodness within, you welcomed our own jagged flaws.  This fighting quarrel that life can sometimes be, pushes our goodness in, to hiding places that cannot be seen.  But we saw your goodness, and cheered every time you yielded and let just a bit of that light pass the edges of your battlements.  Yes!, we said, it is possible to be good amidst chaos, disorder, and hate.    You are a fighter, and there is no better fighter than a friend who is immovable.   Wound after wound, fear upon fear, insult upon insult.  Nothing could sever the tie that made you our friend.  We grasped hands and went into the battle together.  Our chins held high, just like you reminded us.    Katniss, we will surely miss you.  But there are some things we must ask.  When you fired the arrow that penetrated the force field, did your soul go with it?  Or did our loss begin with the brutal departure of Cinna?  Where did the pluck, and protective nature go?  When did you grow fingernails made to scratch, and hate, and tear the flesh?  You didn't only hurt Haymitch, you injured all of us.    We left the arena with you, and couldn't see the darkness that lay ahead, only to be introduced to a world with so many different people that none of them had time for our affections.  We got to know Gale better, but ultimately he grew tired of us and left.  We met Boggs, and thankfully knew him just long enough to know he was a hero.  Johanna had our hearts, but had been placed behind the steel bars of her mind.  And then there's Finnick, who, like you, had to wear a front, a mask, but who ultimately let us see his light that crept out of the hidden corners of who he really is.  What a great friend, what a good soul.  He stuck with it, he hung in there, and held out for his dear love, Annie.  And then he died and was gone, with hardly another thought at his passing.  How did their souls become nothing more than crumpled pieces of paper on the writer's floor?    And what about Peeta?  Strong Peeta who was warmth, sincerity, and goodness combined in the best friend you ever had.  We were charmed at your exchanges, from awkward moments to the thrills of possibilities whispered by tender touches, and penetrating looks.  He was our friend too.  For one in need, he was the big brother with an arm on our shoulder, and he had his arm on your shoulder too.  But how is it that the two of you who had been through the worst of everything together, became a byword amongst larger things?  Didn't you know that the story was about you?  About Peeta?  About family, and friends?    Was it Snow that turned him into the voice that found truth, joy, friendship, and love suspect?  Or was Peeta your mirror?  How is it that all of Peeta's expressions became a pattern for your own thoughts, and actions?  Yet you tied his puppet strings to your fingers anyway, and played him to be a sad, sorry soul who was deceived by his own virtue.  A virtue you no longer valued.  Don't you realize that you are the only one that could bring him back?  Don't you realize that is the very thing that drew us to you, is your ability to coax the virtue out of us?    Goodbye, our dear friend, who walked out of the arena, and walked into a world of hollowness and pain, for it is there that we must part ways.  We will place your first two stories on our shelves, and wonder where your real story will continue.  We'll probably always be waiting, but we'll wait anyway.    Once upon a time, the Hunger Games was your story.  Once upon a time, you caught fire, and we caught fire with you.  But another time, there was another story.  A story of war, a story of names, and a story of places.  We eagerly came along for the journey, hoping to be with you, but found you were not there.  We turned to your friends, but they didn't want to talk to us.  We waited for your love to return and wake you up, but you were already gone, long gone in a world that fell victim to the pen.  This wasn't your story.  It was the mockingjay's story.  Dear Katniss, you know that you aren't the mockingjay, don't you?  So, we will say goodbye at the edge of the arena, and take comfort in knowing you, and the rest of our friends will be preserved in our hearts as real players in a great history, that in so many ways resembles our own.    And the mockingjay?  You might look to the one with the pen, if you want to learn more about that.  But if you get too close, you might catch the smell of blood and bitter roses.
B00006L9ZT|4.0|Whatever Robert Lepage puts on the Met stage in 2010-12 (as I write, the first installment, DAS RHEINGOLD, is but weeks away), whether the reception is rapturous, scornful, or a mixture, one can expect nostalgia for Otto Schenk's now-retired production, sets by Günther Schneider-Siemssen. This was unveiled at high noon of the Reagan era and was taped for broadcast when still relatively new (1989-1990). It held up sturdily and pleased crowds through the first decade of our present century. By no means the most probing or intellectually stimulating RING staging of its day, nor even as scrupulously faithful and traditional as its adherents would have you believe, it comes closer than anything else on DVD to something Wagner would have recognized. The composer may even have approved of long stretches. The stage pictures are often quite beautiful in their Romantic calendar-art fashion (example: the gods' entrance to Valhalla, rainbow bridge and all, at the conclusion of RHEINGOLD), and from time to time Schenk's orthodox notions combine with the Met's impressive technical and monetary resources in stirring ways (the zealous realization of Wagner's stage directions in the final five minutes of GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG, singled out by Jon Alan Conrad in his excellent Met Guide review).<br /><br />There are performances upon which one could scarcely improve. James Morris's Wotan/Wanderer is vocally Golden Age stuff. It would be churlish to complain that his expressive work is not the equal of his singing.  He meets any reasonable standard, and he looks the part (this being 1989-90, we can pass lightly over the mullet). Heinz Zednik's Mime is master-class material, as expertly sung as in the earlier, more radical Boulez/Chéreau/Bayreuth staging (also on DG DVD), but acted and made up in a more conventionally grotesque way, no longer the Victorian nebbish. The great bass Kurt Moll's Hunding all but walks away with the first act of WALKÜRE: voice for miles and a shaded characterization to go with it. Matti Salminen, once the Hunding for Chéreau, contributes a creepy Hagen to GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG (watch him observing Brünnhilde before their scene together, like a sinister black-voiced bird of prey). Earlier in the cycle, Salminen and Jan-Hendrik Rootering had effectively partnered as the giants.<br /><br />Christa Ludwig, as Fricka and Waltraute (roles she had recorded 20 to 25 years earlier in various segments of two classic audio cycles, Solti/Decca and Karajan/DG), sounds near retirement and is a mite old-fashioned in stage deportment, but recognizable as a sovereign artist. It is a fine farewell/souvenir. Perhaps the nicest surprise is Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried in the final two installments. One despairs of ever hearing and seeing a Siegfried who has it all, and like most modern ones, Jerusalem is modest-scaled to undersized in the face of this role's punishments. But he is more pleasing of timbre and more likeable than most of the competition (both from 1990 and from the two decades on either side). Dawn Upshaw makes a lovely Forest Bird, but one doesn't often hear a bad one.<br /><br />Ekkehard Wlaschiha's work as Alberich might have been better experienced on an audio recording. The character's monster-movie getup seems to me one of the production's miscalculations. The same holds true for the reptilian Loge (Jerusalem again; luxury casting); for the gorgeously intoned but non-acted Sieglinde of Jessye Norman; and for the less gorgeously intoned but diligent Siegmund of Gary Lakes. (The Wälsung twins seem to be operating in their own costumed concert performance; it's up to their foil, Moll's Hunding, to supply what dramatic juice there is in that act of WALKÜRE.)<br /><br />The strength and weakness of the casting is Hildegard Behrens's Brünnhilde. This estimable artist gives an effort worthy of her role's heroic stature, and she is never less than dramatically engaged and artistic in turn of phrase. She benefits from the concentrated nature of this undertaking, suggesting the character's through-line from first entrance to immolation. But one must overlook unsolved problems in all three relevant chapters. She is vocally best suited to the WALKÜRE Brünnhilde, but the Halloween-costume battle armor and the compact sizing of her voice conspire to make her seem diminutive (it is difficult to get Dame Gwyneth Jones's stunning warrior-goddess in the Bayreuth staging out of one's mind's eye). In the SIEGFRIED Brünnhilde, the shortest assignment of the three but the one with the most demanding tessitura, Behrens sounds uncomfortably near the limit of her resources throughout. GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG begins well, but something goes wrong during the Waltraute scene and stays wrong -- I have never heard a commercial release in which the singer of a major role sounded so *hoarse*. The performance is not a total loss, and Behrens even gets some expressive utility out of her froggy sound in the ugly ensuing scene with \\"Gunther\\"/Siegfried, sounding terrified and vulnerable and achieving great pathos. But at no point in this long opera's final two-thirds is she easy on the ears.<br /><br />By 1990, Maestro James Levine had gone most of the way toward transforming the Met Opera Orchestra into the world-class ensemble it is today. The playing as such -- especially at the level of texture -- is glorious. Unfortunately, here, Levine the musician is not the equal of Levine the orchestra trainer and technician. He seems to have been influenced by the records of a certain breed/generation of Wagner conductor, and his Met Wagner (*all* of it, including later videos of TRISTAN, MEISTERSINGER, and PARSIFAL) is a glutinous, secondhand homage to what he heard in his formative years. Certain interwar and postwar German Kapellmeisters might have led Wagner performances as slow as Levine's (this is saying a great deal), but those men had an idiomatic sensitivity to the minute adjustments that enliven long, gradually unfurling movements. Levine knows where he wants to end up, and how quickly he wants to get there, but details of the old route elude him and he will not pursue his own. In Wagner, he has spent a career trying to recreate a product without being in touch with the process that gave it internal consistency. I have not a doubt in my mind that Levine loves this music as much as anyone alive does, and as much as it is possible to love music. But he never shows an inclination to do more than \\"savor\\" it, and his sweaty embraces squeeze the life from it.<br /><br />Levine does have one card up his sleeve, and he plays it often: Following an especially uninflected, buffed-into-somnolence passage, he tends to punch out a motto with rude, exaggerated force and volume, especially in the brass. There is a prime example of this Soltian impulse near the end of WALKÜRE, when we've had the Wotan/Brünnhilde \\"Trance\\" intermezzo for a bit, and the \\"Fate\\" and \\"Spear\\" mottos suddenly break the mood, returning in succession. A strong dynamic shift is built in, of course, but Levine is as heavy-handed in rousing us as he was in putting us in the state from which we need rousing. One supposes this is to pass for \\"contrast.\\" The maestro also comes up short purely as an accompanist, his singers often fighting both to sustain and to be audible (poor Gary Lakes, forced to hold those notes in \\"Wälse! Wälse!\\" for so long that one fears he may keel over). I miss the different side of Levine one hears in such documents as the 1983 video of Berlioz's LES TROYENS (Troyanos, Norman, Domingo). His ultra-expansive approach to Wagner is fractionally better suited (or less debilitating) to the later two RING operas than to the earlier two (RHEINGOLD, especially), but his leadership is the biggest impediment to remaining upright through 941 minutes of a generally attractive and persuasive memento of its time and place.
030745455X|3.0|It's a fun read and Salander is indeed an original, which is just so...rare. But her resurrection at the end made me throw the book. C'mon. Seriously? I certainly didn't want to say goodbye to her yet, but the whole series has hinged on the believable details (especially of setting I suppose), and the ending sort of unravelled that effect for me.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a fantastic bag. The movable slots allow me to make the perfect space for my camera and lens's while being able to create a bigger compartment to hold other things like my DSi, kindle and various cables I use to charge these devices. It's very convenient, I take this bag everywhere with me so it also doubles as my purse. It is a very comfortable bag and I recommend it over any side strap bag if you are not used to wearing them (it really starts to put strain on your shoulder).<br /><br />This bag is a little unbalance if you attach a tripod to the tripod straps, but you can get used to it. Something else I also liked it that the zipper pulls on the inside have coverings when they are shut so they do not scratch anything. There is tons of space in this bag including the pockets. This is something I will be using for a while.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Most CW shows are so superficial and bore me with their storylines by season 3. For me Supernatural has gotten so much better with age. Each season I worry that they have taken on something too big and each season I'm pleasantly surprised with how everything plays out and how we have seen the characters grow and develop. Not to say it's 100% perfect all the time but it comes so close! I wish more people appreciated this show because they have no idea what they're missing out on!

B000002NIW|5.0|Throughout the years of my ever growing interest in music, I have always managed to find Deftones to be one of the bands that easily stand out and make a voice for themselves. They may have been shrugged off by some as \\"just another nu-metal band\\", but do I ever pity those that make that shallow decision. This band has always been far more than that, making a unique voice with each album, and \\"Around the Fur\\" marks the second chapter of their time as a band.<br /><br />While the previous album, [[ASIN:B000002N2Z Adrenaline]] was overwhelming raw fury, this album channels it out with less of the \\"raw\\" factor and paving way for a plethora of emotions, inspired by the tragic passing of Dana Wells. This can mostly be heard from vocalist Chino Moreno, somebody you can't describe and has to be heard to believed.<br /><br />The instrumental spectrum manages to hook you in, whether it would be the opening drum fill to the title track, the guitar reverb in \\"Dai the Flu\\", the build up in \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\", or even the melancholic vibe in \\"Mascara\\", Deftones are a rock band that manages to utilize the best out of their potential. Everything flows freely and nothing is held back.<br /><br />If there are any minor setbacks, I would mention \\"Headup\\", which is still a good song but the inclusion of Max Cavalera may have seemed a bit out of place. Otherwise, I highly recommend this album to those that are fond with the emotion of shoegaze and the aggression of hard rock. Even though the group would have upped their ante on \\"White Pony\\", this is just as excellent and should definitely not be overlooked.
B000083E79|3.0|This compilation represents some of the best of Cher's long and illustrious career.  While everyone's definition of the \\"best\\" is different, we can all agree that Cher is the BEST.    I used to work as an overnight janitorial professional in a doctor's research laboratory.  While the job was challenging and fulfilling in it's own right, having a little Cher on the boom-box always made the quiet evenings go by a little faster.     I've spent many a night dancing and singing along to Cher's \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)\\" while performing my janitorial duties.  Sometimes I get so into the moment that I put the mop head on my own head and lose myself for a while.  I call it \\"losing time\\" because when the song (or songs!) are over, I can't really remember what I was doing.  It truly makes the night go by quickly.  Most of the time I have to turn the music up loud to cover up the whimpering of the research, and a lot of the time, my mop handle gets scratched, but these things don't concern me because I've got Cher.

B0041VIJQG|3.0|If you've heard the album you know the line I paraphrased from Plant.  But Plant didn't actually leave his love behind, as he actually says in the song.  Maybe Plant took his dog to the vet and by accident they neutered the wrong \\"guy\\".  It does seem that he's lost his pair.<br /><br />Plant did make a great \\"Adult Contemporary\\" album with Allister Crowley (was it actually Alison Krauss? I'm not sure).  I'm 42.  My mother is a year away from 70.  And guess what... I put \\"Raising Sand\\" on my mom's iPhone/iPod and now it's her favorite workout album.  My almost-70 mom.  Get the picture??<br /><br />Having established that both \\"Raising Sand\\" and \\"Band of Joy\\" are very good albums, that's not what his legions of crazed fans on every corner of planet Earth want from him.  Where did the Rock 'n' Roll go!!!??  Plant has repeatedly refused to join the other living members (plus Jason Bonham, son of the great John Bonham) of Led Zeppelin in what would undeniably be the BIGGEST reunion tour Rock 'n' Roll has or will ever see.  They did one massive massive reunion concert in London on December 10, 2008.  Every radio DJ, every music magazine writer, and in today's Blogging world; every fan would ALL write about how they couldn't believe they were seeing it (happened in '08 when rock stars called radio stations to tell how they couldn't believe it was happening and thy couldn't stop the tears) and how every member was 100% spot-on with their playing and singing.  That's what every man and boy, woman and girl of ALL ages wants to experience live.  LED ZEPPELIN!!  I have always been a KISS fan, too.  So let me make a quick comparison: But first let me say that I am not saying KISS is equal to Zeppelin.  So, KISS WAS great.  From 1973 to about 1980, KISS was an absolute must-see show.  But then, they stripped off all of the ridiculous excess that made us love them.  They spent the next years from about 1983 to 1994 being just another band.  Then, the Reunion tour happened and KISS has been back \\"Alive!\\" ever since.  So, please Robert, please get this nonsense Adult Contemporary out of your system and, PLEASE, join the other three guys (incl. Bonham's  amazing son on drums) and please do this Reunion before another member dies.  It could happen to any of us.<br /><br />So, if you bothered to read my \\"review\\", you know that, in summary, I view the album this way: \\"Band of Joy\\" is actually a great album.  BUT, it IS NOT a great Robert Plant album.Alive!\\" ever since.  So, please Robert, please get this nonsense Adult Contemporary out of your system and, PLEASE, join the other three guys (incl.

0307455874|3.0|\\"Dreams from My Father\\" was truly an impressive memoir, written with pristine prose and laden with mature, poignant insights.  It was also an insincere and disingenuous piece of work, written by an overly ambitious young man who has carefully mapped out his rise to power.  In the book, there was none of that self-hatred and anger that one would expect from a member, no matter how tall or good-looking or successful, of a persecuted and misunderstood minority.  There was only self-control and understanding, and that came across as far more frightening and disturbing than hatred and anger:  it bespoke of a man capable of the coldest calculation.      \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is Barack Obama having achieved three-quarters of his master-plan.  There is that pristine prose and mature thinking from \\"Dreams from My Father\\" and that cool calculation is ever more present.  Written after having achieved his somewhat surprising senatorial triumph, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" obnoxiously panders to the liberal elites who would form Obama's core constituency at a national level.  Obama is all reason and all pragmatism:  whatever works, he says.  That's all good, and what's even better is he fails to point out any concrete solutions to the malaise dampening America today.  Globalization is good, but it's important to make sure everyone gets a fair share of the pie - but how exactly does Obama propose to do that?      What's truly audacious about \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is it's written in a sophomoric style typical of Ivy League senior theses.  It seemed to be written by a committee with oversight from Obama.  \\"Dreams from my Father\\" was written by an individual, and \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" was written by several people, and there seems to be very little overlap.  Given the clunkiness of Obama's speeches and the clarity of the prose in \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" I would hesitate to think that Obama wrote this book.    Who exactly is Barack Obama except the product of the collective imaginationof America's elite?  What exactly has he the man achieved for himself?  He never published an article at the Harvard Law Review, a truly astonishing achievement.  And he never published an article while as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, an even more astonishing achievement.  There's tremendous doubt that he wrote \\"Dreams from My Father\\" and \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" and he achieved very little in his limited political career.  He seems the perfect product of the liberal imagination, pushed and propelled by the liberal establishment into the presidency because they felt America needed a black president who was actually white.    That Obama is not his own man and that he himself knows that can explain the disastrous decisions he has undertaken as president, first by surrounding himself with the Clinton team that destroyed the American economy in the first place, and then by undertaking a series of bad political decisions (like healthcare) that were part of the liberal agenda but which are bound to destroy the Democratic hold on Washington.          Both \\"Dreams from My Father\\" and \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" are liberal charades, and unfortunately this charade has to unravel in front of the whole world.

He hails from LA, and there are hints of his former life... a shooting, alcohol, and an ex-wife.  Somehow, these events have propelled Stone to Paradise, Massachusetts.  Quiet, right?  Then a serial killer shows up, and a gang rape of a teenager makes life even more complicated.<br /><br />I like Tom Selleck in this role, but he is a bit too emotionally detached from events that should have tied his guts into knots.  Is this his persona in the books?  Or does alcohol provide him the respite from the cutting edge of anger?<br /><br />Maybe I'll find out in the next movie!

B003OF3R0S|1.0|I use to like AX7 til I heard this album, It starts off awesome with Nightmare until the chorus hits, and then I realize how terrible the lyrics are. The singer just sounds whiny and as expected from the whole screamo emo, it is feel sorry for me music. I saw them live in concert at the uproar tour, great stage set up, but I couldn't understand a thing the singer said. The rest of the band sounds awesome, they just need a new singer. He's good at holding notes, but not at making them sound clear. Plus all the songs they sing sound the same. I was waiting for them to say it's your nightmare during every song, because I couldn't tell when one started and ended, sounded like 60 mins of the same song. The best part of this album is the New Drummer, he's awesome. that's the only reason I'm giving it one star.
0786956291|3.0|Ok, the contents of the box set IMO are of good quality and print, others have gone into more detail than me so see those reviews.  My only concern is for current D&D 4e players, its really not needed it is more for a brief intro for newer players but a group of experienced players will not need this box set, not really sure you will need the Rules Compendium either but well see.  If you have 4e already, just stick with that, unless you like giving away your cash to Amazon/WoTC although the price is right here on Amazon, I would never have paid $20.00 for this, its only worth about what Amazon has listed, IMO.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|After seeing the first three RE movies and with nothing really else to do I figured why not and bought my ticket,  and while the effects and overall movie were entertaining at the end it's pretty much what we've seen with the other three released movies pretty much already.  The one thing I appreciate was the new actor to play the character of Wesker as far as I'm concerned he did a very good job and his role far better than the previous actor from Resident Evil Extinction did.  The story plot is of course pretty simplistic and expected but again I like I'm sure many others expected this as well so we really can't complain about this either and one little spoiler expect a cameo return of another character from the RE games/movies to make an appearance in this movie as well.  I did see the movie in 3D but I would say it was 50/50 in the feeling that it made a big difference in watching the movie so in that part we'll have to leave it up to the moviegoer. So if you're looking for your fill of zombies and hard-core female fighters with an attitude here's a pretty decent movie to check out on your free time.

0439023483|4.0|Wow!  This story was so intense!  I had a hard time handling it, and I'm an adult!  I can't imagine being an early teen and reading this story.  Very well written!  It keeps the pages turning with surprises around every corner.  The story takes place in a fictional futuristic North America, which is divided into 12 districts.  Each district draws two names from a \\"hat\\", a girl and a boy.  These two are to represent the nation in a nationwide broadcast event called \\"The Hunger Games\\", a fight to the death for survival.  Suzanne Collins does an excellent job balancing action, emotion, and description, as there is the perfect amount of each!  It was not so like the Percy Jackson series, which I found to be all action, very little description, and hardly any emotion.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" was fast-paced and packed with anxiety. I could not wait to pick it up and see how the story was going to unwind.  Awesome!  Looking forward to reading the second one, unfortunately, I'm on hold for it at my library and it won't be available until 2 weeks!!!!

I have spent time trying to find some thread...some reason that visiting all these people makes some kind of connected point. I can't find it! Very disappointed...possibly in myself for missing a connecting point...and wondering if there was a point at all. I understand that a collection of short stories does not need to connect.

B003UYUQZW|4.0|Video games. Since when did the art of film neglect fine screenplays, theatrical works, novels, and short stories as resources for cinema and settle for making kids' games movie material?  It makes a statement about priorities, right? But given the fact that pure video game entertainment is that important (having never played, this viewer is at a disadvantage), PRINCE OF PERSIA is a surprisingly sound film produced with extravagance and vigor and a wealth of CGI effects, and whatever happens with the little machine held gismo for the video game manipulation to make the experience exciting, that experience has been very well transformed by writers Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro, Carlo Bernard, and game inventor/screen story creator Jordan Mechner.  Disney joins Jerry Bruckheimer (with the fine help of director Mike Newell) in creating what should have been a resounding success at the box office extravaganza.  But alas, this one fizzled.  Why that happened is not apparent from the DVD.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal hits that happy medium as a daredevil Prince Dastan with just the right dose of derring-do stunts, charisma, and finely tuned comedy timing: he makes a great hero on screen, but the costumers should have allowed him to feature his well-developed physique he worked on for this role.  But he makes the little orphan boy turned royal family believable and lovable. His adopted father, the king of Persia (Ronald Pickup), his 'brothers' (Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle), his sidekick Bis (Reece Ritchie - keep an eye on this actor), and his evil uncle (Ben Kingsley) all contribute solid roles with quite a bit of philosophy about family ties and loyalty.  The key to the story is the siege of a borderline rival kingdom ruled by the smart and sassy Rachel Weisz-type Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who guards the dagger that has the ability to manipulate time.  Throw in a group of evil Hassasins (like that play on terms?) lead by G&iacute;sli &Ouml;rn Garðarsson, some nearly unconquerable situations such as the world becoming a quicksand disaster, some wildly hilarious comedy (on the dark side) by tax evader Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), and some changes that the time manipulating dagger can effect and the story spins to a conclusion. This viewer would be ready for a sequel, so entertaining is this diversion of a film, but the apparent box office failure of expectations make that an outside possibility.<br /><br />Though it is always difficult to tell where a Director of Photography and the CGI engineers meet, John Seale does provide some gorgeous desert effects.  The music by Henry Gregson-Williams is appropriate if forgettable.  Coming away from the DVD experience leaves this viewer even more impressed with the spectrum of acting skills of Jake Gyllenhaal.  And that is really enough.  The script makes some strange errors - beginning the film with statements as to how Persia was a vast country that covered the entire Middle East, and then throwing in references in the dialogue to Iraq, Turkey and other countries that makes the research sound shaky at best. It is a great popcorn movie - if popcorn at home weren't such a dietary no-no.

B0025KVLSI|5.0|The Beatles recorded this album in roughly one week, in between constant touring,  Caught in a completely unprecedented international fame bubble, they seem to find solace in a combination of American 50's rock music and originals, mostly written by John Lennon, according to my ears. Most sound very American, quite Appalachian Scots-Irish in fact. I wonder what they were listening to? Maybe Dylan, maybe Joan Baez, maybe Earl Monroe or Doc Watson? Whatever, if some young band opened an album with \\"No Reply\\" today, which is a minor Beatles song, they would be considered the best of their era. \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" similar harmonies, so interesting. And \\"I'll follow the Sun\\" was written by a young teenage McCartney, I understand. So wonderful.And great versions of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Carl Perkins hits too. A less than famous Beatles album, but plenty of brilliance to hear. Nobody sounds like them. So you must hear this! As for the 2009 remastering, considering the 1964 original vintage, I think it sounds fantastic.
B003XX2PPO|2.0|Que lastima que tan esperada produccion sea una decepcion. Yo al igual que otros que dieron su opinion sobre este disco son fanaticos de Luis Miguel, pero no por eso voy a darle 5 estrellas cuando no creo que sea merecido. Este disco parece haber sido grabado en dos dias y no dos años. La misma formula de siempre, nada nuevo, nada extraordinario, nada sobresaliente con un sonido anticuado. Ninguna cancion suena relevante ni resalta como exito.  Que pena, tanta espera para nada. Espero que para su proxima produccion Luis Miguel se deje guiar un poco mas por nuevos y jovenes compositores y grabe algo novedoso y fresco. Esta misma formula ya no le funciona. Mejor suerte para la proxima Luis.
B003ICWTR4|3.0|I caught Bruce Springsteen just as he was building a national audience. He had recently been on the cover of Time magazine concurrent with the release of \\"Born To Run.\\" He was named as one of 3 male artists that were destined to change the face of music. The second was Jackson Browne and one could make an arguement that these two men have had a tremendous impact on music for over 3 decades. Third on the list was a young man named Nils Lofgren. I was a huge fan of Nils and to this day recommend his \\"Cry Tough\\" album whenever I get the chance. Some years later, a struggling Lofgren joined the E Street Band. The night I saw the Boss he was drunk. Very drunk. So drunk that during the solo for \\"She's The One\\" he leaned forward too far and pitched himself off the stage and fell six feet to the floor below. I was very unimpressed.<br /><br />Through the years I've still enjoyed many of his studio releases and heard nothing but rave reviews for his live show. I watched him perform at the Hall Of Fame concerts too, most notably playing \\"London Calling\\" when the Clash were inducted. I was impressed enough that I jumped at the chance to buy this concert when it was released.<br /><br />Midway through the first song I realized that Bruce's voice is absolutely shot. I'm not talking \\"seasoned\\" the way Tony Bennett's voice has become either. I mean shot. No range, no texture and the capacity for little more than screaming into the mike with enough gravel in his throat to pave the length of E Street.<br /><br />Midway through the first disk I almost gave up. The band is as tight as ever. What Max has lost in ability at the drums he's more than made up for in efficiency. Being an older drummer myself I can't help but admire how well he still drives the entire band. God bless Clarence Clemmons. If you've kept up with the music media you are already well aware of the painful battles \\"The Big Man\\" has fought with his damaged hips, spine, and knees. If you focus on him during the show you can quickly see that the man can barely move. Yet he plays with such signature style and tenderness that his axe is immediately recognizable. His style has a signature sound all its own, much like Clapton's guitar work. His bravery and skills should not be missed. Little Steven is a well-known musicologist but his voice, never as good as his best friend Bruce, has lost what little luster it once had.<br /><br />Then came Lofgren's moment to shine. He plays an absolutely magnificent guitar solo that takes the audience's breath away. It's long and shows all the reasons why he was once held in such high regard. Although the camera focuses on his effort, you can frequently see Bruce and Little Steven watching him across the stage. The look on Steven's face can only be described as ugly jealousy. The Boss simply looks bored. Although Springsteen calls for applause for virtually every other band member several times during the show, when an exhausted Lofgren finishes the solo, Bruce simply starts the next song without acknowledging Nils at all. I've played enough gigs in my time to be able to recognize when a band member isn't welcome. Nils apparently will be the E Street Outsider. He's treated like a black sheep throughout the concert and during the finale he follows the Boss out to the crowd and stands beside him. It takes Little Steven less than 5 seconds to race after him and crowd him away from Springsteen and the camera. These may be middle-aged adults, but they act like spoiled children for much of the show.<br /><br />I was so unimpressed by the first disk I almost didn't put part 2 into my machine. I'm SO glad I did. The second half of the show is light years ahead of the first and is packed with highlight moments. The band sings a heartfelt and gorgeous version of \\"Hard Times Come Again No More\\" and then jumps into a version of \\"Rosalita\\" that is so packed with fun and energy that it should be illegal. It was also a special joy to see \\"Jungleland\\" performed with all the love and emotional passion that the song deserves.<br /><br />Buy this concert. It's more than worth the price for just the second disk. Had this been the only disk in the set and included versions of \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Thunder Road\\" it would have been worth twice the price. Unfortunately, it's a two disk set and the only use I've found for disk one is as a drink coaster. Your mileage may vary and you should watch the first half of the show at least once (you did pay for it after all) but the closing hour of the concert is so superior to the opening don't be surprised if that's the only spin you ever give disk one.hat the song deserves.

3527406018|5.0|This is possibly the best textbook on any subject that I have ever read. And when I say read I mean cover to cover, several times! (The book is now so shabby and food stained that I'm thinking of buying another copy.) The previous reviews have said it all but I want to summarize some quick points.<br /><br />1. The footnotes and references are in a class of their own. You MUST read them to get full value. They contain a wealth of critical information.<br /><br />2. The narrative style and method of explanation in this book makes me feel as though David Griffith is talking one-on-one to me alone. In my opinion he is peerless as a teacher!<br /><br />3. The ability of this text to present some of the most complex mathematical material in an a simple, accessible and meaningful way using ordinary, jargon free language is just amazing. Of course particle physics is never going to be simple in laymen's terms but the ability to simplify the difficult ideas it contains as much as possible is critical for a student.<br /><br />4. The ability of David Griffiths to make the subject - even at its most formal and driest points - exciting and alive is a rare and special skill.<br /><br />5. The problems posed at the end of each section are the gateway to true understanding. They are clear, practical, have a definite educational purpose and are often fun to solve as well.<br /><br />5. If you are affiliated with a university or other teaching institution and can get hold of the Solutions Manual, you MUST do so. It is a gem in itself and an essential part of the total \\"David Griffiths\\" experience.<br /><br />Although this book is an absolute must if you are studying the subject and even if you are merely interested in it, there are a couple of minor quibbles that I need to bring to your attention.<br /><br />Firstly, I would have loved to see a bit more on the fascinating subject of Renormalization and especially some of the deeper implications of Renormalization Theory. As it is the subject is treated in a very practical way and the book contains just enough material to enable one to solve the problems and to get on with other things. A little more would have been nice.<br /><br />Secondly, and much more seriously, my copy of the book arrived with a double sided printout of 53 errata. These range from minor typos to complete show stoppers (if left uncorrected)! In fact there are so many of them, and they often have such serious effect on the text that I have broken a habit of a life-time and penciled in the corrections on the pages themselves. I would normally regard this as inexcusable vandalism but the constant referral to the errata sheet had become tiresome. I regard Wiley the publishers of this book to be one of the best technical publishers in the world and I can only guess at the glitch which let so many errors get through to the print stage. Having said this, once the errors are noted and corrected one can get back to the study and enjoyment of this fine work.
B000002UB6|4.0|I'm looking for the song, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" by this band called the Beatles.  iTunes has never heard of them.  And Amazon keeps directing me to the Let It Be album, even though the song in question is not on that album.  I am becoming annoyed.  Where can I find this song?  And why is it not considered one of their classics?  Help!  Anybody.
B000RHKARO|4.0|I bought this as a vinyl album back in the day when it was released. I was and always will be a fan of Mick Taylor, who was a tremendous influence as a guitarist back then.  This album has some nice tunes especially Walkin' On Sunset and if you ever get a chance to watch the YouTube video of the band doing this song, it will make you laugh! : )  The only thing I never really connected with is Mayall' s voice. Man, the song 2401 - gotta tell ya - flat out bad.  Headache city.  Not to mention his phrasing on some of the lyrics are really off.  I think, in the end, Mayall was a great developer of talented musicians but without them he would be pretty much a bargain basement artist.  Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor are guitarists we all owe to John and his harmonica and keyboard playing are great but he just can't sing. Sorry.  Actually, having said that, Bare Wires is his best album although he has some really bad \\"fingernails on the blackboard\\" vocal moments, but Mick Taylor burns and John's overall ideas for this record are really ahead of his time.  I like it - but can't take the voice.
B003UYUQZW|2.0|Like many newer movies, such as the remake of the Time Machine and War of the Worlds, the story here takes a back seat to the well done special effects and spectacular fight scenes.  The chemistry between the primary characters was a key missfire for me  lacking the depth and sparkle of \\"The Mummy\\" - which puts this in an exact perspective - this movie was like watching a poorly done sequel to the Mummy movies - without either Brendan Fraser or Rachel Weiss present. I have greatly appreciated Jake Gyllenhaal in other efforts, but he was wasted here, and all of the silly outfits and god awful hair did nothing to help. Gamaal's performance reminded me of the acting depth of an early Bond girl.  This movie was so dull I fell asleep before it was over...and I may never be bored enough to watch it again to see the ending. I could have had more fun if I'd thrown the $16.00 out the car window. Sorry - but that's my opinion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This certainly isn't a traditional sappy love story that Sparks usually writes. Sure it has the love story and it's set in North Carolina, but he puts in an element of danger. I have read all of his books and I love them all, however I am definitely tired of the \\"I love you\\" on the first date that practically occurs in all of his novels. The rest of this novel makes up for that quick love. It truly is impossible to put down. I made the mistake of starting it before bed, figuring I would read a few chapters and go to sleep - Well, I stayed up all night and finished it. They way it's written is strategic and effective in keeping the reader wanting more (which is why I had to finish it in one night). Sparks has said that this is the next movie adaptation and I'm sure it will work well. There is something for everyone: love story, family life, internal conflicts, danger, and a twist at the end. Well worth the money (the physical book is more $ than the Kindle version - so I don't know what everyone is complaining about; he's a best-seller, it came out yesterday - of course it's not going to be $5!) Overall, I loved it and I don't regret my purchase at all. I'm just sad I finished it already! Can't wait for the next one!
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream\\" is a very uplifting album. Whenever I<br />am in a bad mood or a down mood I just pop in \\"Teenage Dream\\" and I always end up smiling.<br />It has a very good pop beat that keeps you bopping in your car or in<br />your seat at work or where ever you may be listening to the album.<br />When ever I listen to it I picture people dancing and smiling and not<br />having a care in the world.

Taking two days out to read it thoroughly and correct some of the patterns we were guilty of turned the project around for the better. We were able stop worrying about database design and concentrate on security issues.    For me, the best thing about the book is that it serves as a comprehensive reference of the benefits of doing things properly, and justification of the time this often requires.    It helped a lot, very fast.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|SALT<br /><br />STARRING: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, Daniel Pearce and Hunt Block<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Kurt Wimmer<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Phillip Noyce<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 23 July 2010<br />Review Date: 30 August 2010<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone's new film The Expendables, showcases several prototypes of characters from the `one guy goes in and kills everyone', movies from the 80s. I agree with Stallone in feeling that there is a shortage of these types of films in general, let alone descent ones; the last good one I can remember offhand, being The Punisher (2004).<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has impressed me and no doubt Stallone as well, with her latest film Salt, where she shows that it doesn't take a man to walk into a room and kill everyone; she can do it too. And man, does she do it; with skill, style and sex appeal. Short of maybe Charlize Theron, no other actress could have pulled this role off.<br /><br />She is Evelyn Salt. She's a spy for the CIA. Or is she? A dangerous looking Russian man walks himself into the CIA headquarters to report that a Russian Spy living in America, will assassinate the president of Russia, during his visit to the states. Ready for the kicker? The creepy Russian man leers at Evelyn from across the interview table and informs her that she is said Russian Spy / future assassin!<br /><br />You can imagine the look of shock on the faces of her comrades, who are taping the interview from the next room; not to mention Evelyn's. Sadly, that's all I can divulge to you. Trust me, there's so much more to tell, that it's killing me not to - but you'll have to see it for yourself! Twist and turn after twist and turn. Some you may see coming, others you probably will not. Either way - you will have a blast watching her run for her life; the filmmakers leaving us in limbo as to whether we should be rooting for her or not.<br /><br />The film is over the top, sure. At times it's even a tad irritating, having you sitting there going, `Oh, come on.\\" A knife being snuck into the CIA headquarters; unnoticed information on CIA agents' background checks; the Whitehouse being penetrated as easily as a few 17-year-olds sneaking into a frat party; leaps from helicopters and freeways and moving vehicles, and etc., etc. My personal favorite would be Jolie (to quote Woody, from Toy Story), \\"falling with style\\", down an elevator shaft, passing several floors with each jump, and grabbing onto a ledge just right each time. This is something they should have had her do in the Lara Croft movies, as it was done in the videogames; but they didn't, so never mind.<br /><br />Speaking of videogames, Salt could make a very interesting one indeed and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie is followed by a sequel. Videogames? Sequels? `One girl killin' everyone?\\" I know - sounds like it could be a too much, but the film works. It's very cleverly written and directed, and Jolie's butt kicking action scenes are matched evenly throughout the film, with dramatic ones sharing brilliant acting from her two co-stars, Live Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br /><br />Schreiber and Ejiofor both play CIA operatives that work with Salt, and are tasked with tracking her down when she has fled. Neither of them is entirely sure if they should trust her alleged innocence, as the film hurls them after her through suspenseful stimulated action chase scenes close to the flavor of those in The Fugitive and Enemy of the State.<br /><br />Director Phillip Noyce and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer know this genre like the back of their hand and the film proves it. A list of their best achievements would be unrelenting; but a short version between the two of them could include Law Abiding Citizen, Street Kings, The Bone Collector, Patriot Games and The Saint.<br /><br />In closing, having enjoyed the film a great deal, but also having pointed out howun-plausible some of the events were, I feel the need to defend it one last time. I can say that I have definitely seen action films that have pushed the envelope of believability a lot further than Salt, and offered us only phony acting in return to justify their means. At least most of the elements in this film could maybe happen; and the performances of the actors, only add believability to us finding those things being possible.n say that I have definitely seen action films that have pushed the envelope of believability a lot further than Salt, and offered us only phony acting in return to justify their means.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I won't go into the plot really because no one likes spoilers and if you really wanted one, you could go read one of the hundreds of other reviews or go to Wikipedia. However, there pretty much is something to enjoy for everyone in this film. There's a lot of subtle humor, action, and a rather interesting love triangle. That's not to say I would recommend this to a young kid. There aren't really any language issues, but it is kind of sad at parts and there is a lot of sci-fi violence. However, it's a great ride and should be enjoyed by most everyone.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) loves to watch her TV, and she loves her son Harold (Jared Leto). The trouble is, Harry's a junkie; whenever he's jonesing for junk he and his partner Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) take Sara's TV to Coney Island and pawn it. All the yentas (Louise Lasser, et al) on Sara's block know that Harry steals her TV, but Sara won't turn him in. Even the pawn broker, Mr. Rabinowitz (Mark Margolis), wonders why she lets him get away with it time after time.<br /><br />Once she gets her TV back she'll most likely be watching an infomercial by Tappy Tibbons (Chris McDonald). It seems like he's always on. Like a poor man's Tony Robbins he whips the crowd into a frenzy--and there are prizes. He claims his regimen will change your life. All you have to do is stay on it for 30 \\"Days of Fury.\\" He sells motivational DVDs. Sara Goldfarb is happy just to watch it on TV, but then she gets a phone call that says they want her to be on the show.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sara Goldfarb: Harold, I'm gonna be on Television.<br />====================<br /><br />She gets carried away by the idea of being on TV. It is kind of ironic to have Ellen Burstyn playing this role, because she is a veteran actress from the Golden Age of Television. She's been on TV a lot. Burstyn has had 5 Oscar nominations and won the lead actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Sara Goldfarb, on the other hand, has never been on TV. Sara Goldfarb gets so taken by the very idea of being on television that she goes on a diet so she can fit into her red dress. An unscrupulous doctor prescribes pills that get her hooked, just like her son, Harry--but with the extreme side effect of psychosis and paranoia.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sara Goldfarb: And you should see my Harry on Television. We're giving the prizes away. I JUST WANTED TO BE ON THE SHOW.<br />====================<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream is mainly about Sara and Harry Goldfarb, Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love, and Harry's girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). Gold, Silver, and Love. At first they all have gleaming bright dreams, but everything goes dark.<br /><br />This film is based upon a book by Hubert Selby Jr.. He also wrote Last Exit to Brooklyn, and that was made into a film years ago. Selby has had a hard life and his writing is very dark. Very, very dark. There are a couple of conversations with him in the bonus material on the DVD. Selby didn't use any apostrophes in Last Exit to Brooklyn. He would write \\"dont\\" instead of \\"don't.\\" I thought that it was kind of an affectation, but nevertheless, his writing holds a dark power. However, no matter how dark it gets, there is always compassion for the characters. Though Harry has pawned his mom's TV so many times they've lost count, once he gets ahead, he buys her a new TV.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sara Goldfarb: I love you, Harry.<br />Harry Goldfarb: I love you too, Mom.<br />====================<br /><br />But this is a Hubert Selby Jr. story, so you know the good times won't last for long.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that Director Darren Aronofsky (Pi, The Fountain, The Wrestler) was true to the spirit of Hubert Selby Jr.'s book, and the performances by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans, as well as the other cast members, were excellent. Aronofsky shows the exhilaration, but isn't stingy showing the high price they will pay. For that reason the last half of the movie grows increasingly grim, and it may be disturbing. I recommend it with caution.<br /><br />[[ASIN:078401213X Pi]] (1998) Written & Directed by Darren Aronofsky; Mark Margolis was Sol Robeson; Sean Gullette was Maximillian Cohen; Ben Shenkman was Lenny Meyer<br />[[ASIN:B000CRKW9A Last Exit to Brooklyn (Import, All Regions)]] (1989) (book by Hubert Selby Jr.) Hubert Selby Jr. was Car Driver<br />[[ASIN:0783230486 How to Make an American Quilt (Ws)]] (1995) Ellen Burstyn was Hy Dodd; Jared Leto was Beck<br />[[ASIN:B000286RO8 Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]] (1974) Ellen Burstyn was Alice Hyatt<br />[[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]] (1999) Jared Leto was Angel Face<br />[[ASIN:B00000K3D4 Labyrinth]] (1986) Jennifer Connelly was Sarah<br />[[ASIN:B0002VYOVI White Chicks (Unrated and Uncut Edition)]] (2004) Marlon Wayans was Marcus Copeland<br />[[ASIN:B00007BKVC Thelma & Louise]] (1991) Christopher McDonald was Darryl<br />[[ASIN:0783227922 Reality Bites]] (1994) Keith David was Roger<br />[[ASIN:B001I5XQP2 The Opening of Misty Beethoven DVD Constance Money Unrated 1976]] (1976) (uncredited) Mark Margolis was Unhappy Guy on Plane<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Big Tim: I know it's pretty baby, but I didn't take it out for air.<br />====================7DFJ0G Fight Club]] (1999) Jared Leto was Angel Face   [[ASIN:B00000K3D4 Labyrinth]] (1986) Jennifer Connelly was Sarah   [[ASIN:B0002VYOVI White Chicks (Unrated and Uncut Edition)]] (2004) Marlon Wayans was Marcus Copeland   [[ASIN:B00007BKVC Thelma & Louise]] (1991) Christopher McDonald was Darryl  [[ASIN:0783227922 Reality Bites]] (1994) Keith David was Roger  [[ASIN:B001I5XQP2 The Opening of Misty Beethoven DVD Constance Money Unrated 1976]] (1976) (uncredited) Mark Margolis was Unhappy Guy on Plane    -----------------------  Big Tim: I know it's pretty baby, but I didn't take it out for air.   ====================
0374158460|5.0|Franzen's long-awaited fourth novel - it's been nine years since his National Book Award winning The Corrections - stands up to the anticipation. Mining similar territory - educated middle-class dysfunctional families - at pretty much the same length, Franzen uses his acerbic wit, unsparing insight, and deep sympathy to draw the reader into the fraught lives of his characters.<br /><br />The book opens with an introductory portrait of the Berglunds, Patty and Walter; a summation of their lives from the vantage point of their former neighbors in St. Paul, Minnesota. The Berglunds moved away to Washington two years ago, but, shockingly, \\"greener than Greenpeace\\" Walter has been lambasted in the New York Times for conniving with coal companies.<br /><br />\\"Then again there had always been something not quite right about the Berglunds.\\"<br /><br />Walter and Patty had arrived in St. Paul as gentrifying pioneers. \\"In the earliest years when you could still drive a Volvo 240 without feeling self-conscious, the collective task in Ramsey Hill was to relearn certain life skills that your own parents had fled to the suburbs specifically to unlearn, like how to interest the local cops in actually doing their job...\\"<br /><br />Patty was a perky stay-at-home mother of two, Jessica and Joey, with - annoyingly - never a bad word to say about anyone. She had grown up in Westchester, NY, and had come to Minnesota on a basketball scholarship. \\"One strange thing about Patty, given her strong family orientation, was that she had no discernible connection to her roots.\\" She never went to visit - they never came to St. Paul.<br /><br />Walter was a \\"generous, smiling, red-faced 3-M employee they remembered pedaling his commuter bicycle up Summit Avenue in February snow.\\" And when the happy family began to unravel, \\"everybody had the sense, fairly or not, that Walter - his niceness - was somehow to blame. Instead of dragging Joey home by the hair and making him behave himself, instead of knocking Patty over the head with a rock and making her behave herself, he disappeared into his work with the Nature Conservancy....\\"<br /><br />Joey, the apple of his mother's eye, had begun sleeping with the decidedly down-market girl next door at some point in early adolescence. Patty, of course, was the absolute last to know and immediately and permanently lost her charming, self-deprecating cool.<br /><br />By page 26 we know all this. The following sections home in on each of the characters one by one and much is explored, including the events in St. Paul and life before and after.<br /><br />The first and longest (and best) section belongs to Patty, who titles her therapy-prescribed autobiography, \\"Mistakes Were Made.\\"  Caustically funny, painfully honest, it's written in the third person, and Patty refers to herself as \\"the autobiographer.\\" (Later, in a separate \\"Conclusion,\\" she addresses this, saying she has been trying to write in first person. \\"But she seems doomed, alas, as a writer, to be one of those jocks who refer to themselves in the third person.\\")<br /><br />She delves into her unhappy childhood as the only non \\"Creative\\" in her political, intellectual, arty Westchester household, her flight to college in the Midwest, her floundering attempts to widen her world and, of course, her smoldering (mutual) attraction to her boyfriend Walter's cynical, indie-rocker, bad-boy best friend, Richard. This section ends with her reluctant move to Washington with Walter: \\"OK, I can do this. (Was she also conscious of the proximity of the University of Virginia where Joey had just enrolled? Was her grasp of geography maybe not as bad as she's always thought?)\\"<br /><br />After an interval with the glowering, talented, bad-boy, Richard Katz (\\"Grim situations were Katz's niche the way murky water was a carp's.\\"), the book moves on to Joey, who shares his mother's attractiveness and desire to have cake and eat it too. Joey, now at college, thinks maybe old Conniefrom home isn't cool enough as a girlfriend.<br /><br />Meanwhile Walter, with his smitten young assistant, is twisting his brain around a convoluted plan to save the West Virginia mountains by letting coal companies slice off their tops.<br /><br />Though the book takes place before and after 9/11, which affects its characters in background ways, the title plays on the freedom that people have to mess up their lives and the lives of those closest to them, sometimes intentionally, often not. His characters do bad, selfish things - and the more attractive do more of them - but their deeper humanity keeps our hope alive.<br /><br />Franzen is also really good at poking fun. Liberals, conservatives, business-types, dropouts; they all preen in the spotlight of his wit. And the blacker things are, the more mordant the humor.<br /><br />\\"To pass the time, Walter did mental tallies of what had gone wrong in the world in the hours since he'd awakened in the Days Inn. Net population gain: 60,000. New acres of American sprawl: 1,000. Birds killed by domestic and feral cats in the United States: 500,000.

Though the book takes place before and after 9/11, which affects its characters in background ways, the title plays on the freedom that people have to mess up their lives and the lives of those closest to them, sometimes intentionally, often not. His characters do bad, selfish things - and the more attractive do more of them - but their deeper humanity keeps our hope alive.    Franzen is also really good at poking fun. Liberals, conservatives, business-types, dropouts; they all preen in the spotlight of his wit. And the blacker things are, the more mordant the humor.    \\"To pass the time, Walter did mental tallies of what had gone wrong in the world in the hours since he'd awakened in the Days Inn.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|Even if you have the proper BD player, if you don't have it connected to the internet then expect highly annoying, slow menus before you can even to the point of playing the video. A truly stupid design. There should have been a binary decision tree at the very front of the menu system for a non-connected option, but alas, no one was smart enough to take that decision.
B003VANOFY|5.0|4/1/15 Update: Still using the headset, and it still works fine. It is used 12-15 hours per week, every week, and has been since I bought it. I've replaced the ear cushions (frayed, worn out) and the headstrap cushion cover is frayed . . . but everything else is A-OK. 4 years of continuous use and still going strong.  7/5/12 Update: I've used this headset now for nearly two years, same usage pattern, and it still feels and functions as new. Normally I'd have concerns about the life of built-in rechargeable batteries, but this headset just plain continues to work. Even if/when the battery ultimately fails, it can still be used as a corded headset. This is a good one :)  11/26/11 Update: Ventrilo PTT key now works very nicely. You can set up a standard keyboard key to PTT from the keyboard, and a G-Key to PTT from the headset when you are AFK. I have used the headset for more than 1 year now, a minimum of 3x3hr sessions per week on Ventrilo and a few hours a week on Skype. The headset has performed perfectly. Upgraded the rating to 5-stars which applies if you are purchasing these to game and use Ventrilo.  [original review follows, edited to show PTT now works.]  First off, the G930 is physically a nice headset. Adjustable, comfortable, not too heavy compared to other full-sized, circumaural headphones. I'll leave full judgement on the quality of sound to others, since these older ears are no longer qualified to critique. But I *can* say you get clear, soft or loud sound from them :)  Ventrilo 3.0.5 Push to Talk (PTT) ================================= The only reason I'm writing a &#34;Day 1&#34; review (which is normally not worth much lol) is to note a key advertised feature that does not work. The reason I bought these headphones vs several others was the three G-Keys, and their ability to send commands to my PC while I am physically away from the keyboard. Specifically, the advertisement that Ventrilo &#34;Push to Talk&#34; was supported. It is not. [as of 3rd quarter 2011, this feature works very well].  The G-Keys work with a drop-down, limited LIST of applications, ie., Windows Media Player, iTunes, Winamp, PowerDVD, WinDVD, and the G930 software itself. Ventrilo 3.0.5 (app & version number) is also listed, and a listed action for this app is &#34;Push to Talk&#34;. I checked all those things before I bought, but after an otherwise pleasant hour with Logitech support in the Philippines, the function does not work, it is a known issue, and &#34;they will get back to me when there's further information&#34;. [It's meaningful to note that Logitech support *did* get back to me several months later to notify me that the PTT feature now worked.]  Logitech G-Keys - What is Expected from a Brandmark =================================================== The other thing you should know is this: When Logitech mentions &#34;G-Keys&#34;, that word invokes the functionality of EVERY other Logitech product that has &#34;G-Keys&#34;. PC gamers know the term. G-Keys can be programmed to send any key, key combination, or string with one key-press as if it were typed, very quickly, via the keyboard. The &#34;G&#34;930's G-Keys do NOT work that way. Each of the few listed apps has only a short list of pre-determined command choices. This important difference is obscured, no doubt intentionally, in Logitech's limited literature.  Other Observations ================== Range: 40' seems a fair estimate of range vs the advertised range of other products. So I get a little more range than bluetooth, and arguably half what I get from, say, Sennheiser RF Headphones (100' &#34;open air&#34; advertised). At the edge of signal loss, the headset becomes slightly directional, ie, you can at times re-acquire or lose the signal. This is pretty much standard in my experience.  Environment: My G930 needs to operate in a &#34;radio-noisy&#34; and highly metallic environment (lots of gear, transmitters, metal in/on exterior walls), and it performs as well as any RF devices I have used here.  Ergonomics: Pretty good, with some &#34;buts&#34;. All the keys placed on one ear piece is a good decision, but crowding can lead to indvertant button presses when picking up and donning the headset. Choosing the left ear piece was a good choice, but left-handed mousers will have some adjustments. OTOH, the G-Keys don't have much - er, any - practical gaming function, so this isn't an issue.  The &#34;Power On&#34; key implementation is unusual, and very poorly defined. The best I can tell, to turn the device off, hold the button in for 3 seconds (not 5), and if it changes to blinking green when you release it, you have successfully shut it off. If it doesn't, hold the key a little longer next time lol.  I'll be back with updates when I have used the device long enough to know it. Yes, I'm keeping it, yes I like Logitech products, and I'm hopeful eventually the G-Keys will eventually be real G-Keys. (As of 11/11 they are not.)  10/20/10 Update: ================ I originally posted these two as workarounds for PTT. While they are no longer required, they may still prove useful: 1) Very Cumbersome: When going AFK, switch Ventrilo to &#34;open microphone&#34;, and rotate the headset microphone up to mute, down to talk. 2) Highly workable: G930 software supports &#34;plug-ins&#34;. Fortunately, a User has created one that works not only with Ventrilo (I tested it), but should work with other voicechats. The sole drawback is you push the Gkey once to &#34;talk&#34;, and once to &#34;stop talking&#34;. The download, description, and cause of this drawback is in this Logitech forum thread (Page 2 at this writing).
B003VANOFY|4.0|First, these is a seriously snazzy-looking headset. I love the styling. And it's pretty comfortable, with its memory foam headband.<br /><br />The sound is excellent, even with a couple of walls in between. Good sound isolation. Very good mic quality, although it's fixed on one side (left). On-headset volume control and programmable buttons, e.g. to let you control media playback on Media Player. Battery life is at least 7 hours.<br /><br />Note that to get surround sound you'll have to switch it on on the headset itself. The surround sound effect is definitely there. You can control volume for each channel and basic equalization (bass, treble) via the included software. Strangely, it does not save the mic gain setting; you'll have to keep setting it.<br /><br />It has a nice cable-thingy to wrap around and tidy it up, which also allows you to use it while it charges.<br /><br />There are some complaints about the range not being more than 40 feet. This seems unreasonable to me, unless you want much larger hardware or a shorter battery life. It's an engineering tradeoff. Speaking of which, I wish the dongle were smaller, but such is life. I also wish the buttons were more programmable.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty well-made headset.<br /><br />Unfortunately they are not PS3-compatible :(
B000002MFE|5.0|This cd is great.  Most of the songs sound like \\"Tears in Heaven\\" and \\"Layla\\" which I like.  I bought this CD for those 2 songs, but I enjoy every single song on it.  They do sound alike, but do have differences in Tone, etc.  Good cd.

B002VPE1OS|4.0|I've used a number of protective films for my iPhone, and this one performs on par with the others I've used.<br /><br />It goes on relatively easy (be careful not to get air bubbles in it), and seems to protect well.<br /><br />This film has a more flat finish.  The result is your screen doesn't look as glossy and photos don't look as crisp, but the upshot is it lasts longer without looking all scuffed up with scuff marks and fangerprints.<br /><br />I recommend this product.
1400052173|4.0|Rebecca Skloot set out to write a book about the cells that Johns Hopkins researchers harvested from a tumor that killed a young African-American woman in the 1950s.  Those cells, known as HeLa, had a life of their own.  They were fruitful and multiplied, they traveled around the world, and they provided science with the source of scores of life-saving discoveries.  It would have been a good, if dry, book.      In the course of investigating science's use of those cells, however, the author found a much better story, one that begins with the researchers' failure to inform Mrs. Lacks's family (and perhaps Mrs. Lacks) of what they were doing.  As a result, the family did not discover the cells existed until decades later.  This is no Tuskegee story; there is no evidence of racial animus or even racial motivation.  But the Tuskegee study forms the backdrop against which the family's discoveries take place.  Rumors of \\"night doctors\\" who kidnap African-Americans for research, stories of major corporations getting rich off their HeLa culturing -- the author relates them all with impressive objectivity.  Indeed, one of my few complaints about the book is the lack of any authorial judgment.  (My main complaint was far pettier; the author appears not to have met a contraction that she didn't like.)      The story ends with the publication of the book itself, an event that seems incomplete and anticlimactic only because Henrietta's daughter Deborah, who has become the center of the story, died several years earlier.  By then, though, most of the family seems to have come to terms with the events surrounding Henrietta's cells.  It is an impressive story, filled with fascinating characters, and one well worth reading.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The movie hits theaters on October 1, 2010 but I was able to see it at a screening last night.     The Social Network is a great film with an intelligent script, solid acting and great direction. It's enjoyable to watch. It portrays the Facebook phenomenon in a refreshing light.     In the first opening sequence the audience the audience is introduced to a script that makes them think. The film contains very witty dialogue as an Aaron Sorkin (Charlie Wilson's War, The West Wing) film should.    David Fincher's direction is subtle and natural. Fincher (Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) stresses the balance between the characters, choosing to let the actors do the work, instead of forcing them to act in specific ways.    The film is a portrayal of what led to the invention of Facebook and as such is fascinating to watch. Jesse Eisenberg (The Squid and the Whale, Zombieland) is key to making Mark Zuckerberg come off as an understandable character. At one point, he is told, \\"You are not an asshhole, you just try hard to be one.\\" And that, to an extent, is what Facebook is like too.    For anyone who is a Facebook user and mildly interested in the man who created the social network, this film shows a glimpse of the man behind the software and of the intricate powerplays that have made it Facebook what it is today.
1594481938|1.0|Bemusement.  I'm filled with bemusement by the large number of 5 star reviews of this book.  This book is improbably bad and I had to abandon it about half way through, going any farther along would have been painful and an unwise waste of time.<br />Other reviews, particularly the one star explain why.  This review is just to help lower the star weight and, one hopes, save some hapless reader valuable time and money.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is probably the only Neil Young CD you will need if you loved his hits, such as, \\"Old Man\\" and \\"After the Gold Rush\\".  I think this cd has his best songs on it which is why I got it.  Great cd for the price.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Love it! Saw this special on TV and decided to order the DVD. Brand new in the package. If you love Elvis; you'll love this performance.
0439023483|1.0|My 7th grader is required to read this for her language class, and wanted me to read it so I could discuss some of her homework questions with her.  I spent 4 hrs. last night reading it.  Then I spent a sleepless night having nightmares related to the plot.  Though the themes of the damage of mindless entertainment, and lack of courage in the face of a corrupt government are worthy of address,  I think there have to be less graphic ways to present those ideas.  If Suzanne Collins wishes to provoke thinking about how desensitized we can become to brutal entertainment, is she not almost fostering more desensitization with her presentation of the brutal murders of children?  Though well-written and plotted, I personally think this book is completely inappropriate for children under 16.
044661758X|4.0|A friend once told me that this was THE books to read, and that she had the book on her shelf at home, but every singe time a guest came to stay, and started reading the Conrete Blonde, they left with the book in hand. She'd buy another copy - and same thing happened, time and time again.    So I got the book. And my friend and her guests were right. This is a gripping story of a woman found planted in concrete, and how Harry B delves into the case, haunted by this woman's grisly death.    It's led me to the other Harry B books, and happily!
B002ZIAC26|5.0|At least, not yet.  I've listened to it quite a bit thru other venues and this is the first album I have heard in a while in which I liked every track.  Certainly has my vote for album of the year.
B002VPE1OS|4.0|Most screen protectors are very challenging to apply correctly and you wind up ruining one just trying to get it on the phone. These Amazon brand screen protectors are fairly easy to apply if you follow the directions, and do a great job at protecting the screen from scratches, dirt and dust. The protector lasted quite a while. Using the screen protector compromises the crystal clear clarity of the screen a bit, but in my experience they all do. It's worth it to protect the screen. The anti-glare feature is very nice. Compared to the name brand version, I feel the Amazon product protected my screen well and I would definitely purchase these again.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|I have often found some of Michael Moore's offerings to be somewhat over-the-top in over-generalization (Sicko comes to mind); however Capitalism: A Love Story has the director returning to some of his best, hard-hitting, and controversial best such as Roger and Me and Fahrenheit 9/11. His expose' on the often quite ugly underbelly of our winner-takes-all approach to wealth accumulation has some truly eye-opening segments, such as exposing the practice by some corporations of taking out insurance policies on lower-rung employees that provide them the benefits when employees die. Many people loathe Michael Moore for the much the same reasons that others regard him as a hero and a spokesman for the oppressed. Love it or hate it, this film is one his better offerings.
0375842209|5.0|Nazis and Jews. You would think that this is another boring book, but its not.  Its a great book for all ages that can actually understand this book. Its told by Death, and represents Death in an unique way. The first page will just grab you completely and utterly.  You actually can care for the characters that are portrayed in the book, and is a great, but a bit long of a read, being 550 pages.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|There is alot of negativity for this album because it doesn't sound like the 'old' linkin park.  I was in 'shock' when Minutes to Midnight was released and it was a different sound. I did get over it and listened and liked it more,that said it's still their 'worst' in my opinion.  This album is better than minutes to midnight, and is unique in it's own way.  If you didn't know this was linkin park i think many would actually like it, rather than hate on it cause it doesn't sound like Hybrid Theory or Meteora. I am one of those that misses the old sound, but if you give it a chance you may enjoy this music as well. This is a love/hate type of album, but don't let your original linkin park bias get in the way of you enjoying it for what it is, something new and unlike we've heard before.  I think this album is more 'artsy' than anything and probably won't have many singles on the air, but I am enjoying it.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Just so everyone knows....  2 years ago (around the time A New Divide) came out Linkin Park said they wanted to go in a new direction from what they had been doing.  I believe they said they wanted to make songs that don't sound like anything out right now.  Present A Thousand Suns...  No one should be suprised that it doesn't sound like what they have put out previously.  I have been a fan since the begining and I thought Minutes to Midnight was amazing; well i think they have trumped that.  A Thousand Suns is different but that's what i love about it.  I kinda think it sounds like Thrice's newer songs.  I don't understand the bad reviews!
0470876417|5.0|I have an MBA and have run several businesses.  That doesn't mean a hill of beans, but I will simply say this - I WISH I HAD THIS BOOK YEARS AGO!      This brilliant little book cuts right to the heart of the big issues of business strategy.  It does in a way that encourages collaboration and multiple perspectives.  I really can't say enough about this book.  Wonderful.  Every business leader, entrepreneur, and would-be business person should spend some time reading it, thinking it through, and putting it into practice.
B000SMWUPS|2.0|If you order the Sunshine Kids Accessory Buggy be prepared for the following:    ** It doesn't fold with your umbrella stroller.  It has a strong wire around the top of it which requires you to manually dismantle one side if you are folding your stroller.  If you are checking your umbrella stroller in at the airport, then you would have to completely remove it.  This may not be a big deal for some, but for me it was a deal breaker.  I want ease of use at all times when dealing with a toddler, getting the stroller in and out of my car a few times a day, and definitely not something to deal with at the airport.  I sent mine back once I discovered it's inabilty to fold and got the Maclaren Universal Organizer.  I am more than satisfied.
0439023513|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!  SPOILERS!!!!      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            When I first finished the book...I wasn't sure what I felt. I felt a sense of...disquiet? Discontent? And then I really considered it. I realized that I LOVED IT! I think it was the only way she could have up-ed the stakes from the 2nd book--how can you add tension when they've already had 2 Hunger Games, District 12 is destroyed, and her family is safe? Simple: Brainwash Peeta against her, have him try to kill her and say things that defy the ONE constant in this entire series: Peeta loves Katniss unconditionally. Not anymore. Have a REAL Hunger Game--so, an actual WAR, when the arena is the entire country and you REALLY don't know who to trust. Question Gale's loyalty to her, have him hide things from her and ultimately become an instrument of her sister's destruction. CHECK! Introduce District 13 and raise them up as another power, which, when corrupted, can become just as dangerous as the Capitol.   The ending was so poignant. I think I teared up. Let me quote. A LOT    QUOTES:      \\"You love me. Real, or not real?\\"   I tell him, \\"Real.\\"     \\"Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us!\\"    \\"It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.\\"     \\"Well, don't expect us to be too impressed. We just saw Finnick Odair in his underwear.\\"     \\"I clench his hands to the point of pain. \\"Stay with me.\\"   His pupils contract to pinpoints, dialate again rapidly, and then return to something resembling normalcy. \\"Always,\\" he murmurs.\\"    \\"But collective thinking is usually short-lived. We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.\\"    \\"Because something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children's lives to settle its differences. You can spin it any way you like... But in the end, who does it benefit? No one. The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world where these things happen\\"      \\"There are much worse games to play.\\" --MY personal favorite.    END QUOTES:    I loved it. It saddened me, especially the epilogue, and how she never told us the names of her children, just called them \\"the boy\\" and \\"the girl.\\" That showed a sort of distance, a way of keeping herself apart from them, at least when sharing them with others.  The final line was brilliant, epic, and summed up the entire series.   The book didn't meet my expectations, but in a truly GOOD way. She wrapped up loose ends, but left some things unsaid, and I mean, come on--how can Katniss and Peeta ever be normal after all the things they've seen and the people they've lost? If it had been like, \\"And they lived happily ever after and forgot all about the Hunger Games and had 17 children right away, even though Katniss had always said that she'd be too afraid to bring a child into an imperfect world\\"  I thought it was perfect, a perfect melding of hope and despair.      I give Collins a very enthusiastic THANK YOU! for the chance to share the ride.
0316098337|4.0|I approached this book with a bit of apprehension as I typically avoid novels that focus on child neglect or victimization. I was intrigued by the premise of the book (how would a five year old child see the world when for the first five years of his life his view was restricted to an 11 x 11 room and the distorted perspective of daytime TV?) and decided to give it a shot. I have to say I am glad I did, this book is a remarkable effort.     Jack, the five-year-old narrator, and Ma, his 26-year-old mother. Are being held in a shack by a deranged rapist. Jack was born in the shed and his worldview is limited to his environs and the glimpses of the outside world viewed on their small television. Ma tries to make Jack's life as enjoyable and normal as she can, ingeniously using the merger supplies she has on hand to instruct and entertain. (For example using her foot to estimate the measure and then cutting a ruler out of an old cereal box and measuring distances in the cabin.) Jack, being a cleaver five year old, finds these activities fun and loves his life with Ma. The only time he is bothered is when Ma gets sad (For example when he talks about being a \\"grown up\\" 10 year old in five more years time) and when \\"Old Nick\\" visits at night. Ma is careful to hide Jack in the Wardrobe at night and Jack knows never to come out until they are sure Old Nick isn't coming or is gone. When Old Nick comes Jack tells us that he measures time by the creaks of the bedsprings.      As the novel progresses Jacks vista's change and Jack's adjustment to the outside world, his perceptions and perspective, remain interesting but don't feel as fresh and true as the first section of the book. I guess maybe that is because I don't think I have ever read anything quite like the first half of this book. Jack's voice, which takes a while to get used to, is singular and his perspective is unique. Through Jack we can see how things that we consider ordinary can also be extraordinary. The second half of the book reminds me of other survivor-type stories I have read and some of the storyline seemed a bit melodramatic to me.  That said this is a well-written book, with a compelling storyline and interesting characterizations.     Those who enjoy this book may also be interested in reading [[ASIN:0312595670 Still Missing]].
B003NHRIVQ|1.0|I own the book, and love it. However, watching Miley Cyrus play this part, was beyond painful.
0439023483|5.0|While this book was written for the young adult market, any age will be hooked by the intelligent and absolutely riveting writing in this book. The main character, Katniss, is an unwilling participant in the gruesome \\"hunger games\\", in which youth are pulled from each district in the nation to fight each other to the death, all of which is shown on reality TV.  Fantastic book.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Linkin Park's fourth album is a daring attempt to go far outside their roots and create the freshest music possible-- A concept album about being an album in its purest form and an exploration into the hearts and minds of mankind as a whole. This gorgeous album will be reviled by metal heads and fans who have a very thin music taste-- People who only like a verse with beats, and a chorus with power chords won't enjoy the unique song construction and strong electronics. But this is far more unique.     This is an album rich with layers of great electronics, some of the bands best vocals and lyrics that blow all three of their last albums out of the water. \\"Burning in the Skies\\" is a wonderful piece that accurately displays how great Shinoda's vocals is while pushing Chester's to a new place. Following that is \\"When They Come for Me,\\" one of the album's best songs, where Shinoda raps to fans that he will not be manipulated in to making the same type of album or sound over and over. It's a fantastic song with a great Nine Inch Nails vibe to it.    \\"Waiting for the End\\" is a beautiful song and a great second single for the album. Here, it becomes clear that Mike's rapping will never sound the same on any two songs on the record. He has truly found a way to make his raps and rhymes versatile. Meanwhile Chester displays his widest range of vocals on greats like the elctro-distorted \\"Blackout\\" and acoustic closer \\"The Messenger.\\"    If you don't like this on first listen, try it again. It is meant to grow on people. But if you're not willing to explore music outside of the generic radio-single, rock song, just listen to something else. The fact that this is a hard album to swallow is proof its a smart one. A Thousand Suns is pure art and perhaps Linkin Park's greatest music to date.
B001QXE0OC|1.0|Selena Gomez is living proof of how Disney Channel is trying to poison our youth with poorly written  lyrics and even worse auto tuned voices. Please stop trying to corrupt the minds of young children because honestly they don't know better and if you continue to promote this dreadful artist you will drain the creativity out of every children's' mind who listens to her.<br />Time to focus on the lyrics. \\"I hear it everyday. I hear it all the time. I'm never going to amount to much, but they're never gonna change my mind.\\" Even you know you won't amount to much in the music world, so stop. Additionally, in that same song she adds, \\"how many inches in a mile?\\" Really? How about you focus on math class instead of auto tune. \\"Get you not to treat me like a child\\" Maybe if you knew math people wouldn't treat you like a second grader.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever read. I stayed up late Into the nights reading, it's a book you can never put down
B003VQM2M4|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for quite a while, and now that I have it I'm absolutely loving it. They really cover a wide area here. From doom to psychedelic to soft sounds all in one song, it's really got everything. It's good to see someone (Nick Cave and band) who's been making consistently good music for years tread into new territory with such flair and keep it up. My only gripe is that one song in particular really sounds like a Bad Seeds b-side and almost seems like it's just on there to be a single (even though Heathen Child is the single and goes way out there compared to this), but it's still a good track and I can't really fault it.
0439023513|3.0|I feel cheated of nothing but a proper ending. No, I'm not searching for a fairy-tale ending. I really don't mind if the outcome is completely morbid but for cripes-sake, you just can't wrap an entire revolution, overthrow the whole government system, and end the book 5 pages later. Come on. \\"Everybody goes home. Some time later a person of interest shows up. They get married. The End.\\" What? Nothing about the new government in place, the mother, Gale is an afterthought. No proper main character conclusions. Just \\"we did it, go home, the end.\\"    I loved the 1st book, liked the 2nd, and thought all of 3 was good. At least I couldn't put it down. But when the ending came, I closed the book and thought to myself \\"thats it?\\". I can fill in the blanks on my own well enough, but some things shouldn't be left to the readers imagination.
B003UYUR10|5.0|After all of the reviews I had read I was a bit apprehensive of giving up my hard earned bucks to see it at the theater..... boy was I glad that I did! This movie had a great story line and the acting was well done. I thought that the special effects were good but not too over done. It is the type of move you walk away from with a smile on your face. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a quick movie pick-me-up!
B003V5PPZG|3.0|I loved Hybrid Theory and Meteora. I liked Minutes to Midnight. And I just simply like this album. I don't hate it or think it's terrible. But I would not put it on the level of their three previous albums. I love the messages and the beats, but every track just seems to be forgettable. I'll listen to it a few more times, but I can't imagine myself listening to it a few months from now. I like the album, but having been a fan of Linkin Park for years and been to many of their live shows, I'm ultimately disappointed by this album.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved the movie!!  How can a 2 disc special edition be on just one disc??  I know there are flip discs but this plainly says 2.  Please tell me Summit is starting to go smaller on us half way through the series!!
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert, whatever fountain of youth you ran into.. I want to find that too.  What a great album (again).  This is not unexpected after Raising Sand, but it does make me wonder if he can read my mind somehow~~LOL.  This is just another recording of music I needed to hear.  It's different.  It doesn't copy or match anything you've heard in a long while.  It's really good.  I said the last one would get grammys, but this one should pack in couple or more too!
6305161992|3.0|I remember seeing this when it was first released on VHS and I remember liking it quite a bit. It popped up on my radar again and I noticed all the positive user reviews. I figured\\" why not revisit this little gem.\\" What was I thinking!? What a dumb flick.    Now yes. I realize this is made for the martial arts fight scenes and the action in general. But jeezo peezo Batman shouldn't you at least try to write a script that makes some sense? This is barely a sketch of a plot. Dolph plays an L.A. cop who grew up in Japan and witnessed the murder of his parents at the hands of a Yakuza. Said Yakuza ends up in L.A. to build an empire on a new street drug, and who does he run into...Dolph Lundgren (go figure). Lundgren now has his umpteenth partner, Brandon Lee, and they are going to do the bad guys in.    Mark Lester will never be accused of being a great director. He is strictly a meat and potatoes kind of guy and he proves it here. Very little in this movie makes any sense. There is no cleverness in their tracking down the bad guys. No \\"by the book\\" police procedure. (Don't you need to fill out some reports when you kill a crap-load of people)? It just gets dumber and dumber as you plod toward the end.     Even the technical stuff is kind of sucky. Bad sound mixing and editing. The continuity isn't.....continuous. The editing in general is lousy. I don't remember much of the music so I guess that wasn't as sucky as the rest of the stuff.    As is usual in these movies, the bad guys can't shoot worth a darn but the good guys can put your eye out at 50 yards. And, get this, at one point, when Dolph is being shot at, he holds up his hand to block the bullets. Yup. I can stop all kinds of bullets with my hands.    The two leads do an OK job (I'm grading Dolph on the curve) and Tia Carrere is always easy on the eyes, but this movie is a mess. I should have kept it in my memories. It looked much better there.
044654759X|4.0|When I pick up this sort of book, I don't expect my world view to be changed, or to become enlightened as if I'd just had a near death experience, what I expect is to safely escape reality and the cares of the world for a little while.  Save Haven is just that, a safe haven in the reading experience.  I read enough non-fiction to find it very enjoyable to pick up a Nicholas Sparks and leave the cares of the world behind.<br /><br />Safe Haven may be a bit predictable, but what makes it stand out for me was delving into the mind of a control freak.  Katie Feldman has a secret she's running from and it's a big one.  She's found a safe haven in a small South Carolina town where she can just live life on her own terms, safe from fear.  Of course it doesn't last because stories need endings, and too much happiness can ruin a good story like nothing else.<br /><br />The hero in this story is a man who does the right thing and loves his children.  With only this guy, the story would be pure vanilla.  Throw in a 'bad guy' who's good at his job and loves his wife, and you've got some swirls of chocolate thrown in that are delicious.<br /><br />I like that the main character of the story realizes that the world if full of shadows where things aren't as simple as they might seem.  I won't give away anything else in the story because I read one review and it spoiled the ending for me.<br /><br />Safe Haven is just what you'd expect from Nicholas Sparks, but I think that's a good thing.
0345440803|5.0|I liked Tracy's style of baby-raising (From \\"The Baby Whisperer\\"): you respect your child, his outlook & his needs, but at the same time YOU are in charge. So when my infant became a toddler (with all the \\"fun\\" that comes with the territory, I picked up this book.  Definitely a good choice. Basically, she says that routines are important because they help your child predict what's coming next... and, at that age, having a measure of power over his situation is important to a little one- that said, you can't go overboard. Her whole mantra is to draw a line between establishing that you're the one in control while meeting his needs & understanding his situation from his point of view. And no corporal punishment.  You provide controlled choices instead of open-ended questions (Example: Instead of saying, \\"Are you ready for your bath?\\" which leaves the possibility of his replying, \\"No!\\", you'd say, \\"When you take your bath, would you like to use your red washcloth or your blue one?\\"- Genius!). Already my little guy has responded well, & I'm not done yet.  Also, the way the book is structured is helpful- you can pick out a topic you need help with & skip right to that section, rather than reading the whole book. And frankly, who has time to do that with a toddler in the house?
0761119752|5.0|How can you NOT love Sandra Boynton books?  We got most all of her board books for our 11 mo old triplets & they are great.  Perfect length, fun rhythm and rhyme, and very durable which is important when three babies are eating them!
B000GFLE1S|4.0|I remember when this was first released but somehow it made no impression on me. I thought I remember the critics being rather lukewarm on it and it made no big splash at the box office. Somehow it popped up on my radar with some very positive user reviews. I figured \\"what the hey!\\" let's give it a go. I'm glad I did.    Because of my schedule, sometimes I need to watch a movie in two sittings, and that would have been the case here, but I couldn't turn it off. I found myself wrapped up in these people's lives and the plot and had to see it through no matter how late I stayed up.    Others have recounted the plot so I won't do so, but this was just a big, pleasant surprise. Just as in the movie \\"Once\\", this movie is filled with a bunch of genuinely good-hearted people. In a similar situation, where blue collar workers are confronted with a transvestite in their midst, there would be a lot of ugliness and violence. Not the case here. And, as the plot progresses and everyone realizes the score, they all pull together.     I was taken aback to see Chiwetel Ejiofor playing the transvestite. I simply couldn't see him pulling it off. It took me a few scenes but he got better with every passing minute. Joel Edgerton was a bit restrained for my taste but it DID make his transformation at the end all the more notable.     There is really nothing new about the formula here. What does make it stand out are the ingredients. It's a nifty twist, filled with a lot of good people. You really care what happens to them in their plight. And when the end comes there is a great sense of satisfaction.    This is one cool flick. Sit back and enjoy.
0451228375|1.0|Ken's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was such an incredible book, that have I read it over several times.  I'll read it again. However, I'm not sure it is possible for the same author to have written both of these books. The negative feedback preceding my review speaks to the boredom, pain, heartache, struggle to survive that THE READERS have experienced with this book. I was sorely disappointed throughout, with the possible exception of the descriptions of the plague.  That livened things up a bit.  But I have a BIG bone to pick with the plague.  HELLO!! The nun who so valiantly continued to tend to the hundreds of croaking plague victims was a few centuries ahead of her time in coming to the conclusion that one could prevent contracting the plague by using a simple cloth cover, bandanna-style. Mr. Follett, besides the fact that the concept of airborne germs was hundreds of years in the future, THE BLACK PLAGUE WAS NOT SPREAD VIA SNOT OR SPITTLE!!!!  It was spread when fleas carrying the disease bit people. FLEAS! They didn't even make an appearance in the book. Rats became infected, they carried fleas, fleas bit people, and about 50% of the population of Europe died. I struggled along to the end, like a good trooper, but this book had none of the wonderful characteristics that \\"Pillars\\" did. Do not waste your money. A 1,000-page book is only great if there is some wonderfulness in it. A work of \\"historical fiction\\" should have some \\"historical\\" in it....also lacking. I'm still upset about the fleas.  If there had been fleas, maybe there could have been one of those \\"flea circuses\\"...like in the cartoons. But, no.
0316044938|2.0|I think the reason this book got such press is the shock factor of the first chapter,  the grafic rape and murder of 14 year old Susie Salmon. To be honest thats where the story ended for me, nothing else happened... The rest of the book didnt hold my attension it was an effort just to finish it.     Ive also seen the movie, thats why ive given the book a 2 star, the movie was even worse.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|New movies are coming out all the time and it seems the two genres which are constantly popping out an influx are chic flicks and suspense/crime/thrillers. Chic flicks usually have a loyal following. Write a tear-jerking story and throw in a cute, romantic guy and you got a hit. The thriller is a little more complex. You need an intricately-wound plot line, with twists and turns and enough action to keep you into the movie. This is where I think \\"The Ghost Writer\\" falls short.  After the tragic supposed suicide of the ghost writer for former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang's memoirs, an unnamed, unsuspecting writer is hired to continue the work. Soon after taking the job, the Ghost learns that Lang is being accused of war crimes and is under investigation. He begins to wonder what he's gotten himself. Over the course of the interviews and researching, the Ghost begins to see that some of the stories are not adding up. He probes further into the mystery and many elements remain hazy, but this much he is able to deduce: that his predecessor was murdered.  There are so many technical components that gives this movie high quality, not the least of which is Roman Polanski's brilliant, detailed directing. It seems Hitchcock's ghost has been visiting him. The set of eery hotels, bleak beach houses, and dark forest roads lend a ominous quality to the film. You never feel quite safe. The cinematography employs cold lighting. The music is perfect: a little creepy, but not horror creepy. More along the lines of you can tell somethings not quite right. These are just some things that are executed with such perfection that it's sure to be studied by film students for years to come. The casting and acting is top notch. Ewan McGregor is back in his role of naive writer thrown into a story he isn't prepared for, a role he seems to have perfected (Moulin Rouge, Men Who Stare at Goats). Pierce Brosnan's acting is getting better with age. He fits the bill of the suave British PrimeMinister in emotional and ethical turmoil perfectly. An unexpected talent is Olivia Williams, absolutely brilliant in her part of the Prime Minister's wife. She acts with such force and confidence that you know right away there's more to this character you're seeing right away. But the script and the plot are just too weak. You know you're supposed to feel suspicion and suspense but you don't know what it is you're suspicious of or who. There's not really a focus for your fear. Which I guess might be accurate because the Ghost doesn't really know who dunnit or who he should trust. The problem is he seems to trust everyone. He calls a number scribbled by his dead predecessor, he confides in Lang's wife, he blatantly questions an obviously suspicious source about the former writer's death, and he lays everything on the table before Lang who is the last person he should trust. And not that action is everything (this is after all a political thriller), but there is almost none of it in the whole movie. The best we get to see is a pseudo car chase and someone escaping a boat with relatively no danger.   Also I don't know how Polanski can't see the parallels between Lang and himself. High profile figure under investigation for past events, sheltering in a foreign country. It's a little awkward.  It's a shame that this movie wasn't better written. It has so much going for it. I would recommend seeing it because I know some people who absolutely loved it and after a few more viewings I might too. But it didn't grab me on the first watch and quite honestly, I don't feel the need to revisit it.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|Has a sharper-sounding, better mixed, more passionate, organic live album been released? There is reason to doubt it.<br /><br />All the more power to Leonard Cohen that he has been able to command high prices as of late in his touring - after all, he needs the money - but for those with sophisticated musical taste and a wallet that is incongruous \\"Songs from the Road\\" is a mighty handsome consolation prize.<br /><br />The applause from the audience is non-intrusive, but warm and enthusiastic. Cohen wraps his warm, trademark voice around every syllable. His backing vocalists complement him with angelic, lilting, delicate beauty, and his touring musicians are impeccable - never a beat is missed.<br /><br />To see and hear this live CD/DVD combo on the home entertainment system is better than being in row 200 at the concert. After all, Cohen's idiosyncrasies and incisive lyrics are too heady and sublime - in a setting that lacks intimacy they lose something.<br /><br />With \\"Songs from the Road\\" we get the feel of an audience of thousands appreciating the music, but they are firmly in the background. The sound quality here is the quality of being fifth row center. The knowledge that these songs were recorded at various venues is remarkable, as they flow seamlessly on the CD.<br /><br />The urgent, complex \\"Waiting for a Miracle\\" sounds undilutedly smoky and probing, and \\"Lover Lover Lover\\" is a rousing joy to hear - the bristling enthusiasm Cohen displays here is something most of his peers are, by now, phoning in or feigning during live appearances. The same can be said for the particularly poetic \\"Chelsea Hotel.\\"<br /><br />\\"Avalanche,\\" from 1971's \\"Songs of Love and Hate,\\" is sharply draped in cool, elegant vengeance. The iconic, eloquent \\"Suzanne\\" still sounds fresh as well. If Cohen has tired of it, it does not show in his performance.<br /><br />\\"Hallelujah\\" would benefit from a starker arrangement. Here, the backing vocalists and band dilute the power of the song slightly, although their contributions miss no beat and sound crisply professional. It is a minimal misstep, especially when there are so many different recordings of the song to choose from.<br /><br />It is a breath of fresh air to see Cohen enjoying the renewed burst of popularity he has enjoyed since reintroducing himself to the spotlight, and \\"Songs from the Road\\" distills this new phase of his career into a gorgeous, well-wrought, clearly labored-over live album.nd sound crisply professional.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|What a wonderful series this is.  After reading the many positive reviews of this series, I know there is no reason for another one; but I felt I wanted to post something because it is just so delightful to watch.  I grew up watching British dramas with my mother who is British and I have always loved them.  This is now one of my favorites.  I spent my summers in England as a child and the beautiful scenery, the little charming cottages and villages, the depiction of rural and small town life is just lovely.  It completely takes you back to a simpler time and fills the senses.  I cannot wait to watch seasons 2 and 3. So forget the spa -- have a pot of tea, prop your feet up with a slice of Victoria sponge cake or some mincemeat tarts and lose yourself in Lark Rise to Candleford; you won't regret spending the money for a minute!  Enjoy!
0765326353|5.0|\\"The Way of Kings\\", written by Brandon Sanderson, is just a touch over 1,000 pages long.  The entire time I am reading it I was thinking, is this too much.  It just kept going and going, running into so much detail.  Not that it was boring in any part, it was just so much.  Do we really need all the detail of a \\"safe-hand\\"?  By the time I reached the final page, in just less than a week mind you, I continued to flip through the back cover hoping there might be more.  Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job envisioning a world of fantasy, leading me through the window to view it, and then opening my eyes to the amazing things he had created.<br /><br />It has been years since I have read a book as in depth and intricately woven as \\"The Way of Kings.\\"<br />The story focuses on Kaladin, a dark eyed boy who finds his way to becoming a man in the hardest and cruelest way possible.  Everyone he knows or comes in contact with dies in one way or another.  Even with him constantly trying to do the right thing, it always ends up leading him down a path towards doom.  What he doesn't realize is by the time he finally reaches the end of his path, at least in this volume, he has acquired knowledge and skills far beyond his years.  He has become a leader of men and someone others instantly respect.<br /><br />Even the high prince Dalinar owes a great debt to the lowly slave named Kaladin.  Dalinar who, with his son Adonlin, strive to live the life you would expect from a high prince.  He respects others, lives by the code and insists that everyone be treated with kindness.  He believes in all of these things, except when he is on the battlefield, killing Parshendi.  Then he is a master in the art of death.  Only when his visions begin to affect his judgment does he suddenly question why killing so many can ever be the right thing to do.  The only real question is, will Dalinar's trust be the end of him, his son and his entire family.<br /><br />His family which includes his niece, Jasnah, the daughter of the king, who has taken on a new ward named Shallan.  Shallan is a low level aristocrat, but she is doing everything in her power to save her house, even if it means lying and stealing from the woman she has grown so quickly to respect.  The real question is not what Shallan is doing, or not even what she has learned, but in the end, what really is Shallan and do we understand her hidden capabilities?<br /><br />The dueling issues with fantasy writing are keeping the story moving while opening our eyes to a brand new world.  Brandon Sanderson has done this masterfully.  His vision is filled with sprens, and contracting vegetation.  There are highstorms which can kill, and the Parshendi mutes, who are both slaves and slayers of the king, as a splinter group of them form into an orchestrated wave of fighting death.  There are betrayals and twists where you believe you know what role a person might be playing, only to be surprised to find out they are on the other side.  You really have to keep your wits about you as you plow through page after page effortlessly entertained.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I really enjoyed this book.  But in the end I was debating on whether to give it four or five stars.

B002ZG980U|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Inception (2010) is a brilliant film - intelligent, exciting and dazzling. When the award season comes, and it is not nominated for editing, screenplay, music, cinematography, set decoration, art direction, and directing by Nolan, I'll be very surprised. Nolan is highly talented as both director and writer and should be recognized for the amazing achievement which his new film is. By the words of writer/director, \\"the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream... Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences.\\" Inception feels like The Matrix on steroids with the impossible structures of M.C Escher coming to life, with some ideas shared with Solaris and the short stories by Jorge Luis Borges such as The Circular Ruins and The Secret Miracle, and with the script that would do honor to Charlie Kaufman. In my dream world, I want Nolan and Kaufman work together and I would love to stay in the alternative reality they'd create. I would not mind the totem top spinning endlessly advising me that I am in the dream world of Nolan's and Kaufman's imagination. As it is, the film is a great entertainment, the real feast for brains, senses and feelings. There are so many references to the studies of the most mysterious stage of human brain, dream state, specifically, lucid dream. There are the nods everywhere to the previous films, mythology archetypes, literature and art works. I found particularly touching the use of the Edith Piaf's song, Non, je ne regrette rien and casting as one of the main characters of the film Marion Cottilard, the 2008 Oscar winner for playing Edith Piaf. Acting in the film is pleasure all around, starting with Leonardo Di Caprio (Hey, someone give him an Oscar already) as an expert in stealing the ideas out of the human brains in the lucid dream state, who has to perform the opposite task of inception the idea in someone's brain. Everyone was memorable and well-cast including Joseph Gordon-Levitt whom I like in every film I've seen him, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, and already mentioned Cottilard. My favorite performance is by Ellen Page as Ariadne - what a fitting and appropriate name for the Architect of the dream world's sets and mazes and the guide inside the labyrinth just like her mythological namesake princess on the island of Crete. With all its complexity, reality within dreams, many layers of subconscious, projection and manifestation of the dreams, three or even more states of dreams all played off each other and communicating with each other and the wake state, the film in its core tells a very simple story about one man's burning desire to go home to these whom he loved the most but couldn't be with. It is about love, guilt, creating and living the dream, and finally letting it go. It is an action thriller sc-fi heist that simultaneously plays in four or even more different level of subconscious but with the real feelings and emotions. It is spectacular. It is the best Christopher Nolan's film I've seen and in the very end of his film he wants us to acknowledge that everything we saw has been designed by him. He is the architect of all layers of dream. We are in his dream and that's why the totem keeps spinning and never stops as the screen turns black.human brains in the lucid dream state, who has to perform the opposite task of inception the idea in someone's brain.

B003BYYDXW|1.0|Justin Bieber is exactly what is wrong with today's music and the world; I smiled when he got hit with the bottle.<br />His new album \\"My World 2.0,\\" is the same name as his last album but with a number to let you know that this is the second one.  I thought it would at least have a different name, no matter how clich&eacute;.  The cover is a similar generic picture of him looking serious in black and white.  Let me just say all the songs sound the same.<br />Baby: This is as generic as love songs can get, targeted towards lonely teenage girls. This song preps you for what is to come, a repetitive sequence of \\"you and I,\\" \\"baby,\\" and \\"love,\\" there is at least one baby in each song. You have been warned.<br />I need somebody to love: He highlights his apparent lack of \\"somebody to love,\\" \\"I don't need nothing else,\\" and apparently a promise of true love. Sounds like a fairytale puked all over the place and left us to clean it up.<br />Stuck in the moment: Now after he tells you how much he needs you, he tells you: \\"You and I both know it can't work,\\" as he alludes to Romeo and Juliet I can feel Shakespeare frowning in his grave. The same type of beat is used in each song, hip-hoppity pop beat, with random cases of auto-tuning.<br />The rest of the songs, are basically the same sequence of craptastic sounds.  Targeted to girls, no room for men to be able to enjoy it.  All the songs are about love, and that special girl; if you feel this songs make you feel like a beautiful unique snowflake, rush as fast as you can against a wall, hopefully then you can see the light and stop slowly killing your brain cells with this garbage. The lyrics are incredibly unoriginal and repetitive, throughout the whole album. Spare yourself some trouble, and listen to some Barry White if you want to listen to someone who can at least sing.
0671449028|5.0|My 15 month old son loves this book so much I have it memorized.  It is a great book to incorporate into the nighttime routine.
B000OPO6VU|5.0|This album definitely isn't as raw and explosive as a lot of ELPs other albums, but it is swift, fluid, and creative. I find it particularly inspiring to listen to on a cool autumn evening.     The way the album is structured, musically, is quite unlike a lot of the other albums I've heard before.     It features some beautiful and amazing piano peices from Keith Emerson (which I think should rank him up with 20th century classical composers) throughout the album. Greg Lake's vocals match these piano peices perfectly, anybody ignorant of the player's parts would never guess they were two seperate people.     The album's sound is reflected a lot in the atmosphere of the cover.
B003Q6D29Q|4.0|Walking out of \\"Never Let Me Go,\\" I felt as if I had experienced a death. This isn't to suggest that the film pushed me away. If anything, I was deeply drawn in, entirely taken by the sheer power it had on me emotionally. I'm fairly certain I wasn't the only one; I sensed solemnity in the audience I sat with, the profound feelings of shock, loss, grief, anger, and helplessness. The film projects all that, as if saying, \\"It's not fair. It shouldn't have to be this way.\\" At the same time, the film also projects profound feelings of resignation, as if saying, \\"Life isn't fair, and it doesn't matter what should or shouldn't be - that's just the way it is.\\" Perhaps so, but that doesn't make it any easier. This movie haunted me, and I don't mean that I was frightened or repulsed; its themes, its characters, and its plot have a lasting effect, the ability to move us in the most personal of ways.    Adapted from the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro (best known for \\"The Remains of the Day\\"), \\"Never Let Me Go\\" takes place in an alternate universe, where medical science achieved what was thought to be impossible; in 1952, all previously incurable diseases could be cured, allowing for the average life expectancy to increase to over 100 years by 1967. But how did such a thing happen? The opening title card is intentionally vague on the specifics - all it says is that it was the result of a \\"medical breakthrough.\\" With that in mind, we plunge into the story proper, which begins in 1978 at Hailsham, a charming-looking but isolated British boarding school surrounded by miles of open fields. The children and teenagers who attend know absolutely nothing of the outside world. They wouldn't dream of leaving; they've all heard horror stories about those who have crossed over the fence.    They've also heard repeatedly from headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) that they're all special. What exactly does this mean? We gradually come to understand, although hints are dropped all throughoutthe opening section. Consider the fact that every student wears a special bracelet, one they must pass over a mechanical device whenever they reenter the school building. Also consider that every student has no last name other than an initial. And then consider a lecture given by the ever observant Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins), one in which she sorrowfully explains to the students that, while most children can grow up and be anything they want, they will never be anything; their paths have already been chosen for them. Do the students understand this? They may hear the words, but I imagine it would be difficult for them to fully grasp their meaning, especially when the only world they've ever known has been the grounds of a boarding school.    Emphasis is placed on artistic achievement, specifically poetry, drama, music, and - most importantly - drawing and painting. The best pieces are chosen by an elusive figure known as Madame to be displayed a section of the school called The Gallery. They're encouraged to participate in sports and eat a healthy diet. They earn colored tokens, each having monetary value; every so often, they can use their tokens to buy assorted knick knacks, all delivered to Hailsham via truck.    Three students are introduced: Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy. As adolescents (played by Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe respectively), they dutifully engage in strict regiment, although they also develop as individuals, forming a close friendship in spite of the cliques students are often separated by. Kathy is observant and calm. Ruth is bold and opinionated. Tommy is a shy boy who isn't as creatively inclined and is picked on by other boys. As adults in 1985 (played by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield respectively), tensions rise when they're sent to a residential community that grants them more exposure to the outside world; not only do they not know how to cope in such a place (they're incapable, for example, of deciding for themselves what to order in a restaurant), they're also at odds over their needs and desires, Tommy's physical attraction to Ruth seemingly upstaged by his emotional attraction to Kathy.    The film ends in 1994, at which point Kathy has become a Carer and has been separated from Ruth and Tommy for years. I dare not reveal what a Carer is, nor should I say anything more about Ruth and Tommy, for their fates are too attached to the secret the story revolves around. It's revealed not as a surprise twist but rather as a disturbingly slow unfolding of events, all of which lead to a devastating conclusion. This in itself very easily could have been weepy and melodramatic, but director Mark Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland instead opted to handle it with a fascinating sense of acceptance - sad, but inescapable, like death. Therein lies the tragedy of \\"Never Let Me Go\\"; it's about the certainty of one's existence, the inability to alter the outcome, the painful moments of letting illusions go and facing reality.
B003NX6ZDC|2.0|I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort...I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted...I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers...but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.  Brandon you should recall this album and act as if it never happened.  I hope the next Killers album sounds NOTHING like this or I will be disappointed.
B002ZBTXQY|3.0|Excellent music/vocals!  My only complaint is IT IS A LIVE ALBUM!  I don't like listening to the audience screaming and yelling at the beginning of each song much less in the middle of the song over the music.  In the middle of \\"Breath No More\\" Amy gets the audience to sing for her.  I prefer the studio version (Fallen is the same CD except for a couple of songs).
B003VANOFY|5.0|In a nutshell this set of earphones for gaming does the job. It charges via computer,and is an excellent gaming set,but for my purposes it is great for music too. Logitech is a good company and the fidelity of these phones is excellent.It blocks etraneous noise and can be worn while reading etc.<br />I must admit gaming is not my thing,but my daughter assured me that it is in top form for gaming.They are comfortable and feel good and tight to the ears.Range is pretty good at about 40 feet.Price is just about right for the product.
B003L77TZI|1.0|This album is trashy. It seems to be all over the place and honestley it's one of the most horrible pop albums i have heard in a long time. The songs are catchy but it doesn't save it from being complete trash.    If you want a catchy gorgeously crafted pop album listen to Kylie Minogue's \\"Aphrodite\\". Iif you want Edgy pop music listen to Lady Gaga's \\"The Fame Monster\\"    This album is just complete nonsense. Why anyone would enjoy this album as a WHOLE is beyond me. The beats are catchy, but the lyrics and Katy's \\"voice\\" are just plain horrible.    TERRIBLE TERRIBLE album
B002T9PECO|5.0|Bands with longevity often go through transitions, particularly if they gain success. The Unforgettable Fire represents the first transition for U2 as they move from their earlier raw rock sound (Boy, October, and War) to one that is more atmospheric and cinematic in feel. With The Edge's rhythmic chops and shuffles, Bono's wails and swoons, and Clayton and Mullin's driving beats, the band maintain their in-your-face force while lulling you into a shimmering and beautiful sound. You'll feast on the muscle of tracks like \\"Pride (In the Name of Love),\\" \\"Wire,\\" and \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" before wallowing in the goose bumps inducing moments of stunners like the \\"MLK,\\" \\"Bad,\\" and the title track. The Unforgettable Fire is a classic not only because it produced U2's U.S. breakthrough track (\\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\") but also because it showed the world that they had the talent to become one of the greatest bands of all time.
B00393SG1K|4.0|I'll start off by saying I loved Tokyo Gore Police. I wrote a review for that in the \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" DVD section.<br /><br />However, Tokyo Shock has re-released it with a bonus disc of follow-up short films, calling it \\"Tokyo Gore Police 1.5\\". I actually looked all over for more information on it and came up empty. Hopefully if you're in the same situation, this review will help.<br /><br />I will say that I'm very annoyed with Tokyo Shock's marketing of these.. they release a title, sell them and then a couple months later re-release it with bonus content, basically \\"screwing\\" anyone who purchased it previously. They released 3 versions of \\"Machine Girl\\" and 2 of \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" so far (generally doubling in price over the previous release). Since there are no special features on Tokyo Gore Police, I can imagine them releasing that a third time as well.<br /><br />But for more info on TGP, check out the reviews on that DVDs page: [[ASIN:B001I82RVS Tokyo Gore Police]]<br /><br />TGP 1.5 is the same disc as before, but now includes a second disc of \\"follow-up short films, extending the TGP Cinematic experience\\".. I don't know about that, but that's how they market it. It's basically  a disc of ~45 minutes worth of short films (and a recap of the TGP movie). These are all very low-budget short films (a few minutes each) or commercials, and not of the same standard the movie was made with. I didn't enjoy these nearly as much as I had wanted to, and will likely not re-watch them. I can honestly not recommend anyone who had already purchased the previous release to \\"upgrade\\" to this (as I did), and for those purchasing for the first time, it's up to you whether the 1.5 bonus disc is worth about double the cost of the film itself. It's nice to have, don't get me wrong, but it seems like they just wanted to have fun and threw together a few short movies over a weekend. One of them is actually very good, and similar to the movie, but the rest I didn't care too much for.<br /><br />Also of note, the video on the short films is non-anamorphic (meaning on a widescreen TV, it will have black bars on the top, bottom, left and right of the screen). The 4 star score is for TGP. The short films get about a 2.5.eo on the short films is non-anamorphic (meaning on a widescreen TV, it will have black bars on the top, bottom, left and right of the screen). The 4 star score is for TGP. The short films get about a 2.5.
B002ZG9968|2.0|I really love romantic movies, even the mushy ones. I can overlook slightly bad acting if the script is good. I can overlook a bad script if the acting is good. Then there is The Back-Up plan. This film was very bad on every level. There is a saying about bad acting - \\"They phoned in the performance\\". In this case I wish they would have because at least then I wouldn't have had to watch as well as listen to this horrible movie. I kept fast forwarding to try & find a part that was better. It was consistently bad throughout. I have seen both of these actors do some good work. What happened here? I didn't think Alex O'Loughlin was far enough along in his career to walk through a performance. I really enjoyed Moonlight and he was one of the leads in that. I have also enjoyed a number of other films with Jennifer Lopez. It is a mystery how one something can go this wrong.
B00001OH7N|5.0|All aspects of this record are incredible. If you don't have it, i feel sorry for you, as you are missing out on one of the best records of all time!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Order Pre-release. Received it earlier than promised. Thanks. The Dexter series is incredible: the cast is superb, the writing and the (no doubt) major amount of research that goes into putting together this series is so up to date that it plays like a reality drama of an incident that actually occurred.  So, far of all the the Seasons, this one haunted me the most.  I think its because it deals with things so close home that we all witness and interpret in such a way so that we can file it in the \\"normal file\\" even though we may \\"feel\\" otherwise.  John Lithgow is a fantastic addition to the cast. I will stop here before saying too much - I refuse to spoil any bit of it for anyone! Proud to own all 4 Seasons . . .
0307454541|1.0|I almost compulsively have to finish a book once I start, but I can't bring myself to finish _The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo_. I understand that Larsson died before publication, but the editor should still have spent a long time cutting the HUGE exposition and backstory that is \\"told\\" (in a boring and often confusing way) and not \\"shown\\". The dialogue is poorly and unrealistically written in many parts. I never connected with the characters. Blomkvist's philandering and drabness makes him an unsympathetic central character. Each time you start warming up to Lisbeth, Larsson cuts away in a way that doesn't intrigue, just annoys. I don't even care what happens next, and I don't understand why people are so excited about this book.
B0042KIAZ6|5.0|I wasn't sure that I'd like the new Nikita. I've seen every version of the original story - the original movie, the Bridget Fonda version and the Peta Wilson series. I thought telling the story again would be boring, but so far this show is anything but boring.<br /><br />Maggie Q is a great Nikita. She is dangerous. She is beautiful, and she has this darkness inside of her that makes you feel sorry for the little girl who had been abused.<br /><br />Seeing Melinda Clark take over Madeline's roll was a delight too. I can't think of anyone better for the part.<br /><br />The only reinvention I'm not sure about yet is Michael, but I'll give it time. Shane West is a good actor, but he doesn't have that cold lizard quality the other Michaels did.<br /><br />All in all, I'll be watching this every week, and I'll more than likely be buying a season pass too.
B003T0G9Y4|2.0|I liked the previous books of this series a lot.<br />Becky Bloomwood was, especially in the first three books, a recognizable heroin; we all have spent money we didn't have at one point in our lives. Or at least, I have. She was vulnerable, had a conscience, was very bright in solving her problems and showed a basically sweet nature towards her friends, family and Luke.<br /><br />Though the last two books have been less enjoyable than the first three, I still looked forward to this new one; whatever the books may be lacking, they never lack comical situations and Sophie Kinsella just knows how to deliver a fun story.<br /><br />Right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Not this time. The comical situations were just too easy, you say them coming from a mile ago. The characters, especially of Becky's parents and their neighbors have become painfully one-dimensional. Aldo, Becky is now officially a caricature of herself: she behaves like a total egoist, not only towards Luke and his co-workers, but also in regard of her daughter. What mom would not want the very best for her child, and I am not, I repeat NOT, talking about designer clothes.<br />Becky really only thinks about herself throughout ¾ of the book.<br /><br />Her behavior was cringing, while in the previous books she just seemed to be a bit of a dummy sometimes, driven by her desire of wanting things, now it was just wanting things and deliberately acting stupid. Her sweet nature was gone but her ability to find extra-ordinary solutions when problems arrived, was still alive and kicking. For that, I give this book 2 stars.<br /><br />Of course, there was a nice twist at the end, leave it to Kinsella to do that, and yes, that made me feel a bit better, but overall this was an over the top novel and most of the time just irritating.<br /><br />Do I want to read anymore adventures about a selfish girl? Nope. Please stop shopping Mrs Kinsella, and keep on writing about other heroines, like \\"Twenties girl\\".
1423113497|5.0|My 8 year old daughter started reading these after finishing some fun kid books on Mythology. She read the entire series back to back over the summer break. They were as much of a hit as the Harry Potter series was in our house.
0786956291|5.0|Coming from D&D 3.5, this isn't what I remembered and loved, but its still a good game none the less. I decided to DM a group of people that hadn't ever played before and saw this. With the simplified rules, it makes it a bit more approachable for novice players. This product specifically is a very good starting point. The story based character creation aspect of it (though still took time) was much less of a 'drag' for the new players. They at least got to stay engaged while they were creating their characters. Though the depth of this first story is a bit shallow and will require to you either creation your own and get additional story quite quickly, its deep enough for everyone to get a feeling about whether its something they enjoy or not. Its a light gloss over of a very deep world that gives glimpses of what the possibilities are. That + the price = Perfect D&D intro
0802473156|5.0|I loved this book and it made a lot of since as to why I get angry with my husband! Now if only he would read it!!!
0812550706|5.0|Having been in mother-son book clubs for 11 years, I've read a lot of science fiction that features children. Ender's Game has been the most satisfying read to date. I was moved by the depth of understanding about the human condition the story carries. The aspect of the tale that strikes me as prescient, given the current scientific/cultural shift that views 18- to 24-year-olds as \\"emerging adults,\\" is the consideration given to the morality of sending individuals into war games before they are old enough to fully appreciate the consequences of their choices. For something first published in 1984, this book is aging well. I look forward to reading more of Card's work.
1601252463|5.0|Paizo has really outdone themselves here with lots of great new content for characters in the Pathfinder RPG system. The book presents six new and interesting base classes but there are also a plethora of new options for the classes from the core rulebook. From drunken monk to urban druid, the number of choices allows players to opt to build really distinctive characters.<br /><br />On top of all of that, I must say that the new optional rules really add some more spice to 3.5's \\"move and attack or just attack\\" combat. Methods are given for repositioning enemies, using filthy tricks (sand in the eyes), hero points, and more. The hero points are especially cool, acting like a cross between 4.0 and 3.5 Eberron's action point systems, and there are enough spells, feats, and other abilities that you could even build a character around their various uses.<br /><br />Technically, you could use a lot of the content in this book in a regular 3.5 game, but this is definitely a must-have for Pathfinder players.
0743243153|5.0|I have a audio version of this book and I find myself listening to Mr. Peck repeatedly. This book is so simple in its lessons but at the same time so profound in its advice. I have always found self help books that do not include the religious aspect and the place of God, to be lacking. After all metaphysical questions are meaningless from a atheist's perspective.    I am talking about the religious & God aspect that is distinct from just spirituality. For me Spirituality is not just an end intself , it is a means to an end. On one hand you find very dogmatic religious books and on the other hand you have books that focus just on Spirituality. Both these sets of books might be appealing to large number of people but they haven't benefited me to the extent that this book has.    I think this books does a good job of bringing together the importance of suffering, the existence of God and the meaning of life. It's like a owner's manual to life.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Hello everyone! Supernatural is the best show that I've ever seen! This season, Sam and Dean Winchester have their work cut out for them when they must find a way to still save innocents but also stop Lucifer and the Angels (mainly Michael) from ending the world. The family love, loyalty, and humor is what I love about this show. The characters don't go on and on with a sappy dialogue like other hit shows; instead they are blunt which is a breath of fresh air. (For example: if a character disagrees with another character than they would say \\"I don't think that's right because of blah, blah, blah ....\\" - On Supernatural, the characters would say \\"That's bull!\\") I would recommend to watch the previous seasons of Supernatural before starting season five because it will make the story line easier to follow when past characters come back for a visit (or haunt - lol). I am probably not saying the rights words to convince you that this show is worth it but please believe me. I can count the number of shows that I watch on one hand and Supernatural is on the top of my list.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|beautifully done!  a bit haunting, but awesome!!! great solo effort.  highly anticipate the next album whether it's killers or independent.  go out and buy it now!
B003V5PPZG|1.0|I was really excited with the catalyst and Wretches and Kings being singles released. I played the cd and I held hope for the next song and then the next song but no avail. Eventually I started laughing toward the end and wished I could return the cd. The great mix of rap and singing and then the highs and lows of the songs made older albums amazing. A Thousand Suns is a huge mix of eletronic sounds with very little actually instruments. Singing live was Linkin Parks strong suit but now these songs can't be sung live because there so much eletronica in it that backtrack is all your going to here most of the time. I understand artists must change with time and sing and write what they feel and i applaud Linkin Park if that's what there doing. If that is so this will be the last album I buy and last time I claim Linkin Park as one of my favorites.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|Defiantly one of the more epic albums ive picked up in the past months. It has a different feel about it - sort of a swag. I cant stop listening to it. Five Stars.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Ok this is THEE best version of this movie. The extras are amazing and you get a behind look on how exactly they made everything.  This movie isnt/kinda/ not for kids.Its really adult like humor and also child humor. I suggest parents watching it before they let thier kids watching it.  BUT!, if you yourself havenst seen this movie yet... YOUR CRAZY! and you dont know what your missing. I bought this movie just cause its a classic and the extras. And it was a very good desicion. BUY IT!
B003PX85GK|5.0|This is BOH's best album and I say that having loved their previous records. Give it time. It is a slow grower, but all the best albums are. The thing I love about it is the new emphasis on harmonies.
B003CRM6QO|4.0|I'm a sucker for high definition quality and this blu-ray delivers. The production values of this movie are very high -- the costumes and sets are outstanding -- and it's all beautifully rendered in 1080p24 on this disc. So if you like the Flash Gordon (1980) movie, you will love this transfer.    Now the movie itself is tricky to review. As a movie by itself, I find it lacking. The acting is stiff, the scenes are contrived, and the special effects are comical, whether intentional or not. Despite these shortcomings, I don't feel cheated by this movie because the production values are so high and plot are so over the top. And in the context of cinematic history, I find it to be an outstanding homage, both to the original 1930's Flash Gordon serial and to the 1974 pornographic spoof Flesh Gordon. Yes, Flash Gordon (1980) has all the dramatic elements of pornography but without any of the nudity or sex or c-and-c shots. So if you like campy movies, or you're a cinema buff like me, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie in this outstanding high definition transfer.
B000J159N8|5.0|This is a great movie, complete with men born to be heroes and heroes made on the battlefield.
B002436WFI|4.0|I am among those who loved it, knowing a movie will never quite \\"be\\" the novel, but, with double, or triple echo on Death's voice, it really needs subtitles to help understand his dialogue. With them, I probably would give it 5 stars.
0756405890|5.0|This is a great book.  Patrick Rothfuss is a down-to-earth type of guy and his writing style reflects that.  He writes in a simple, easy to read style that is more similar to JK Rowling than Robert Jordan (that's a good thing).  Where many fantasy books suffer is the long, drawn out descriptions and useless information that often fills many pages.  Rothfuss does not fall victim to this and instead fills the pages with descriptions of meaningful subjects that the reader is actually interested in reading about.  It's an exciting read that encourages the reader to keep turning pages.  Not once did I ever want to put it down or take a break.  Really the best way to describe this book is \\"a darker Harry Potter made for adults\\".      My only real complaint is the long wait between this book and the 2nd book in the series.  4 years!  Rothfuss does have some legitimate excuses as to why it's taken him so long to complete the 2nd book, but damn it!  I'm going to be pissed if I have to wait another four years (until 2015) before the 3rd book is released.  Still, it's worth the wait and I'm excited for the 2nd book.
B00007G1ZC|2.0|If a picture is worth a thousand words, why bother filming the anti-nuke diatribes in the sixth and seventh dreams? To be clear, I agree with the sentiments, but I found this preaching, not dramatizing. I found Scorsese's van Gogh annoying, particularly in his speaking in English when the rest of the dream was in French. And I found the pace glacial (pun intended, regarding \\"The Blizzard\\"). The cinematography is terrific, but steer clear, especially if you find long shots with little to no action boring.
0440242576|4.0|I love John Grisham and to read something that hasn't to do with lawyers from him is fine. This book is very easy to read. I read it in one day, couldn't put it down. Yes, the neighbors are a little annoying, the characters overly dramatic. But isn't it an author's right to do whatever he/she wants with his/her characters? If you don't like this book, don't read it. But I find some people very unrighteously calling this book a bore. It is fun. And I am sure that somewhere in this country, probably on one of the coasts, this is almost like in the book. I have seen some of it.... but after all, it is a book, a fiction! And a GOOD one.
006145205X|4.0|It is highly fashionable nowadays to argue (or at least rhetorically assert) that human beings are degrading their natural environment at an ever increasing rate, so much so that it may one day become uninhabitable, and long before that it will so constrain human development that wars, disease, famine and civil strife will skyrocket. The triple whammy of financial meltdown, climate change and resource depletion will make the 21st Century a dismal time to be alive.<br /><br />Matt Ridley respectfully begs to differ. Already the vast majority of human beings are much better off than they have been at any prior time in history. Even though formidable challenges remain to securing world prosperity, a person alive today has a much better chance of being well fed, adequately clothed, gainfully employed and entertained than at any previous time. Even the very poor in most developed countries enjoy luxuries that even kings could not previously procure, such as sewage disposal and running water, to say nothing of the fact that many of them have TVs, air conditioning, cell phones, etc. Vast inequality remains, but all things considered it is much better (at least in most parts of the world) to be poor today than it was to be poor in the Middle Ages, for example.<br /><br />Ridley devotes the first part of his book to an examination of how we got here. How did human beings manage to escape, or at least continue to evade, the 'Malthusian trap' that keeps the population and development of other species down? Ridley considers in detail currently popular models (such as Jared Diamond's focus on geographical resources) but finds them inadequate. He argues that the crucial factor in the emergence of modern humanity was the development of specialized trade, not only of products but also of ideas. Being able to trade for certain items means that one does not have to make or procure them oneself, which encourages specialization. Instead of spending all day both hunting and fishing, for example, if you can find someone who's a better fisherman than you and can trade (some of) your hunting trophies for fish, the time that would have been spent fishing can now be better spent learning to be a better hunter, which means greater productivity. Up to this point it's Economics 101, but Ridley applies the same reasoning to the development of ideas and language. In a pithy turn of phrase, Ridley speaks of 'ideas having sex', the kind of combination and recombination of ideas that leads to innovation. Together, specialized exchange of products and ideas lead to the amazing technological and social developments we now take for granted (trade also encourages the development of social virtues like trust, which are essential for social cohesion).<br /><br />Ridley then moves on to the present time, arguing that technology has prevented the human impact on our environment from being even greater, and is in fact restoring many parts of our environment. For example, modern agriculture allows human beings to use much less land for farming than they otherwise would have, which means more land can stay forested or wild. Water and air are also on the whole much cleaner around cities in the developed world than in the developing world. He makes a strong case that the best way to protect the environment is to cultivate prosperity, because only people with a fairly high standard of living can afford to care about their impact on the environment. People living at subsistence level will use whatever resources they can to stay afloat, even if they completely deplete them in the process.<br /><br />It would be a Herculean task to summarize all the information, arguments and insights presented by this book. Ridley's coverage is encyclopedic and his discussion exhaustive on many issues. Suffice it to say that this is a powerful argument against pessimism and for rational hope, which however does not mean seeing the world through rose-colored glasses: Ridley acknowledges that there are real and formidable challenges to human prosperity and environmental health. But overall the human historical trend is in the direction of more innovation and greater prosperity, and there are few reasons to think that this trend won't continue into the future.<br /><br />To summarize all of the book's insights and arguments would be a Herculean task, because Ridley's discussion is so wide-ranging.allenges to human prosperity and environmental health.

B0012GMUOU|5.0|I had little idea of what I was in for and only had the samples to go by, but those samples were enough to allow me to take a chance. I've always been a Led Zeppelin fan, and never really got into Jeff Beck, but this album just shows how far behind Jimmy Page is as a genuine guitar playing artist. Jeff Beck rarely holds back and with a techno sound backing him instead of traditional rock instruments, he still rocks out as hard as anyone and it still inspires him to rock out! What other great guitarist could be this inspired by techno beats??? It makes you wonder. What makes this album work is the fact that the guitar playing isn't just endless twiddling and showing off; each phrase or riff created sits in with the beats and contributes to the overall song, rather than being a distraction. The lead breaks are subtle, at times sweet, but always powerful and expressive.<br /><br />I love this album. I could hate everything else by Beck, but this album will forever be on my playlist!
0545123275|4.0|\\"I remember lying in the snow, a small red spot of warm going cold, surrounded by wolves.\\" (p 1. of Maggie Stiefvater's novel, Shiver)  That is how this novel begins and that is what hooked me...a small red spot of warm going cold...the description!  Right when you open this book it becomes apparent that the author is comfortable with language and grammar.  The entire first paragraph is just explosively descriptive, and not in a gushy, overly forceful way.  She really puts you there in the scene, in the mind of the narrator.  Speaking of narration, that too is something I thought was well executed in Shiver.  It's done in first person and it shifts between the story's two main characters, Grace and Sam.  Now generally I am -not- a fan of books that shift perspective, but Ms. Stiefvater manages to make it such a seamless transition that the reader has no trouble switching back and forth.  That said, I think it's also made easier because it does not shift EVERY chapter.  I also like the unique take on werewolves presented in the story - you don't see many authors actually attempting new things.  Kudos to her for that.<br /><br />The characters themselves, even those not in the forefront of the story, are fairly well developed which of course makes for a more believable, likable tale.  Parents should know that though there is a touch of romance in the book, I would say that it's clean and I would not have an issue with my young nieces and nephews reading it.  It's obviously from the telling of the tale that Grace and Sam have something special.  There is a connection there that you simply are able to understand and relate to, instead of having to have the author explicitly tell you \\"These two are in love. The end.\\"  The story was just so well written and so entrancing that I did not want to put it down.<br /><br />I borrowed this from the Library, but I will be buying my own copy.  I'll also definitely be reading Linger, the sequel to this novel, and Maggie Stiefvater's other works.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|In this day and age musicians seem to make music to please the recording companies they deal with. They get too wrapped up in the business end of things. The public at large, that listen to main steam radio and follow what is being fed to them, buy into the bland, uncreative junk that is \\"modern music\\". LINKIN PARK DID NOT MAKE THIS ALBUM FOR US, THEY MADE THIS ALBUM FOR THEM. They follow the philosophy of creative, artistic expression and they have struck gold. If you don't get that then you need to question your own taste in music.
B0015XHQTY|1.0|This is NOT a review or rating of the movie itself (there are plenty of other good reviews here) but rather a comment / complaint on an admittedly small but misleading detail in Amazon's description of this item.    If you look at this item's picture (at the top of this web page) you see a `bullet hole' at the end of the gun's barrel.  That hole is NOT part of the picture, it is an actual jagged hole in a clear plastic sleve that slides over the DVD case (the glass cracks are also printed on that sleve).    If you are a collecter of this (Dirty Harry) series and have other movies with that bullet hole sleeve you should be aware that this movie ordered from Amazon will NOT have that sleeve even though it is shown in Amazon's picture.  C'mon Amazon, pay attention to the details.  Either furnish the DVD case WITH the sleeve or correct the picture.    (Note: I already had this movie WITH the sleve from an earlier retail purchase and recently ordered 2 other Dirty Harry movies, Magnum Force & Sudden Impact, from Amazon which lacked the sleves.  I'm assuming that that Amazon's stock of ALL this series movies is also lacking.)
0307454541|5.0|I don't have much more to say. The other reviews summarize the book very well. It's a great story, a great trilogy in fact, but the main character Lisbeth Salander is without a doubt one of the most interesting characters ever written. So great and so imperfect. This story is harsh and dark and definitely not for everyone.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I love this movie it's great, the bit where Hit-Girl says the c word was awesome! Buy it now you won't regret it!!!
B0036TGSRG|1.0|For the US theatrical release of this film, several instances of profanity were dubbed over to achieve a PG-13 rating, and Summit Entertainment have done nothing to release the film uncut on home video in the States. The result is like watching a syndicated TV airing of an R-rated movie. Pass on the US release; get the Canadian Blu-ray or DVD instead, which you can buy from Amazon.ca. Also a plus: The Canadian Blu-ray does not come on a DVD/Blu-ray combo flipper disc.    As for the image quality of the Canadian Blu-ray release (I assume the US transfer looks on par), it looks great and I assume accurate to its source. High level of detail and refined grain, with no noticeable digital artifacts. You can see hi-res screencaptures at Land of Whimsy to judge for yourself.    The movie itself? Thoroughly engaging in story, acting, and overall presentation. Polanski still has great visual flair, artistic craft, and technical skill, and it's nice to see a thriller that doesn't utilize showy, in-your-face action sequences, but goes for a more reserved, subtle, and realistic approach. It's certainly a breath of fresh air, and I highly recommend it.    The Canadian Blu-ray release is highly recommended. The censored US release should be avoided.
0307591549|5.0|I read a lot of business books.  Most of them are filled with helpful information.  Frankly, most of them are also a little on the dry.  \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" is different. It is filled with fascinating research and great ideas, and it is also a hoot to read.  I found myself laughing out loud as I read the book.<br /><br />Shawn Achor explains the latest research he and his colleagues in the field of positive psychology have conducted.  The results are fascinating:<br /><br />1) Our brains work better when they are \\"happy.\\"<br /><br />2) There are concrete things we can do to make our brains \\"happier.\\"<br /><br />3) We can also overcome our inclination to procrastinate and put off these exercises.  (I found this section to be particularly interesting since I am a procrastinator).<br /><br />4) When our brains are at \\"happy\\" that positivity will ripple out to others and can raise the productivity.<br /><br />Give this book a look.  The research shows that we (and our colleagues at work) can be more productive.  And, if we are \\"happier\\" our boss will also perceive us as more positive, trustworthy, sincere and successful.  Wow!  And who wouldn't want to be happier at work - and at home?
0553805371|5.0|Anyone who has been a fan of Dr. Hawking knows at this point he has been the replacement for Dr. Carl Sagan.  Someone had to fill those great shoes of the scientist who loves to bring cosmology to the masses.  I'll read this book when I can in the next few months.  I don't expect any great leaps forward in revelation or science from it.  After all, science has almost ground to a halt in the discovery of the true structure of the universe.  The problem is that our weak hominid brains just can't handle the kind of complex mathmatics and reasoning it would take to create solid theories and test them.  String Theory for example, isn't advancing much not because of its strength, but rather because it involves such complicated mathematics that nobody, not even Dr. Hawking, is capable of inventing yet.  And that brings up an interesting question: What kind of cruel God would give man the ability to think about this stuff, but not the intelligence to test it?  One of the most well known laws of physics is gravity, and yet we are almost no closer to understanding how it works than when Sir Issac Newton watched an apple fall from a tree.  I find that disturbing.  At least CERN is marching on with subatomic particle structure.  The strong and weak forces of the atom are still giving up their secrets.  But electromagetism is also a scientific boogy-man.  How those fundamental laws of physics all tie together into a Grand Unifying Theory is not going to come easily to humanity, if at all.<br /><br />I'd love for the BBC to bring to humanity another series like Cosmos.  It should star Dr. Hawking and all kinds of cool computer generated voices.  I used to see him on occasion when he would visit the Theoretical Institute of Physics at UCSB.  He is one of a kind.  It would sure be nice to see people discussing cosmology again in the main stream media, rather than Quran burnings or the second coming of Christ.  Not that religion doesn't have its place, but I sure hope the Age of Reason is not dying right before our very eyes.  It seems like it at times.  I can almost feel the heat from the fires that burned the great Library of Alexandria, burning once again; all scientific thought and reason in exchange for some faith-based religious doctrine.  I am concerned that humanity could fall into another \\"Dark Age\\" with the collapse of European style democracy and respect for reason and science.  Scientific reasoning is the last great hope of humanity.  Dr. Hawking stands as a bright light in this struggle; publishing easy to digest books explaining in plain English what kind of stuff the universe might be made of.  And I love his claim that God wouldn't be necessary for creation to occur.  What a great question to pose all students.  It sure beats \\"What did you do for summer vacation?\\"ot dying right before our very eyes.  It seems like it at times.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is the sort of movie that viewers either embrace or are bored by its slow, subtle presentation.  It stars Bill Murray in a serious role opposite a young Scarlett Johansson in one of her first movies as an adult, as two strangers adrift in a strange land.<br /><br />Bob Harris (Murray) is an aging, past his prime actor in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial.  What should have been a simple assignment turns into an extended agony, who is unable to communicate with his intense Japanese director.  Harris suffers from jet-lag and the nagging of a spouse many time zones away.<br /><br />Charlotte (Johansson) is a young wife accompanying her workaholic photographer husband on assignment.  He has no time for her; she ends hanging around the hotel, bored and also jet-lagged.  She and Harris meet at the bar, strike up a casual acquaintence, and end up exploring the bizarre neon-lit nighttime Tokyo landscape.  Along the way, they learn to cope with their shared exile.  Director Sophia Coppola avoids the easy off-ramps for the relationship; the two keep a certain distance and the ending is subtle, touching, and somehow appropriate.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" is recommended to fans of Murray and Johansson as an example of their range as actors.
4770030096|2.0|I am taking a class which says that as part of the class we will be learning Kana.  The class descriptions says buy the third edition of Japanese for Busy People so I assumed I should get the \\"Kana\\" edition.  Oh no!  This edition assumes you already know Kana.  I guess there must be some people learning Japanese who already know the script but I'm not one of them.  Of course, returning to Amazon was pretty easy, I just lost out on the shipping costs and created a delay in my having the book I need.
160094048X|5.0|This cookie recipe collection is phenomenal. As a vegetarian, who does not eat eggs and is interested in sugar alternatives, this book provides the perfect cookie playing field. The recipes are easy to follow, and the cookies look and taste delicious every time. I am addicted to the Rocky Roads (the cookie on the front cover). The cookies have been a real hit with family and friends; I can't wait to try out every recipe in the book!
0756405890|3.0|Patrick Rothfuss's first foray into epic fantasy is a good one.  He develops adequate pace and plot, and the characters are sometimes interesting.  There are, however, a few short comings in this story that keep me from awarding it the final two stars.    First in my mind, Rothfuss uses foreshadowing in a very ham handed way.  For example, he ends chapters with sentences like, \\"Little did he know how bad tomorrow was going to be.\\"     Also, there is something rather formulaic about his approach to story telling.  He begins and ends the book with a description of silence.  Like \\"The Princess Bride,\\" he bounces from story to metastory throughout the novel (I think too often.)    Further, in outlining Kvothe's young life, Rothfuss resorts to money as motivation far too often. (I found myself doing talent to copper penny conversions to try and figure out if Kvothe was going to starve to death or get kicked out of school.) Though money motivates all of us to some extent, an author using money as such a prime motivation comes off to me as lazy.    My last criticism is that the book seems incomplete.  I know that this is one large story that has been arbitrarily broken into three parts, but I would have liked to story to have a beginning, middle, and end in and of itself.  This story has a very quick beginning, then a middle.  Characters are poorly developed (like the girl that lives in the underground, or Denna/Dianne/whoever.)    Overall, however, I enjoyed many parts of the book, and would recommend it to fantasy fans.
1573228737|4.0|Atmospheric and at times quite creepy, this novel explores the charlatans of Victorian England who pretended to be able to contact the spirit realm. Waters has a talent for creating characters who are likeable even when they do pretty distasteful things.
B00000G3AZ|1.0|From a die-hard Jane Austen fan, I can honestly say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was clear watching this film that none of the characters, directors, producers, or anyone involved in the making of this film actually understood the book. Emma is portrayed only as a pretty English woman who has social class and knows it. But the character of Emma is so much more complex. Now, granted, Emma is probably the hardest Jane Austen book to film, because Emma IS so complex, and it's hard to get on-screen, but Paltrow and McGrath did an extremely poor job. When I watched this movie, I had no desire to ever look at the book again.   If you want to see a fantastic adaptation of Emma, watch the 2009 BBC adaptation. Not only is it much better than the Paltrow/McGrath, it is perfect. You will watch the adaptation, and want to start reading the book that night.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I really think this is their most complete and well thought out album. I am amazed by the negative reviews in here. Plus, you can really here them moving towards that Them Crooked Vultures album as well.
B003XL6EKS|1.0|Got the Deluxe version today. No remixes or video. Just 4 extra tracks. Not even the lyrics to the songs.  I have to say after listening to it I am very disappointed. The album goes nowhere. It's all so slow and boring. None of the songs are especially note worthy except for Crossfire and Only The Young. I kept hoping I would hear something uplifting and it never happened. This is def not a CD to play at a party unless you want to send everyone home. It's more of a CD to listen to when you're going to bed. You'll be out like a light before the 3rd song!  Now I'm sorta glad that I wasn't able to get concert tickets for this tour. I would have fallen asleep standing up.  My expectations for Brandon and this album were way too high.  I won't be listening to this CD much I know that.  Too bad. It could have been so much better with what talent Brandon has.

I am 42 years old and am almost COMPLETELY FINISHED with MY Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do It Yourself Book INCLUDING the journal portion in the back. I was a cartoonist as a kid, I am now a recovering wimpy kid, and I am an avid journaler, so this book rates very high in my world. And my kids love to pick it up and see what new thing Dad came up with. It has inspired their creativity and my 7 year old is dying for her own copy. Set the example, parents, do your own Do It Yourself Book and be your kids' hero! Loved the first two books before it, by the way. RECOVERING WIMPY KIDS UNITE!!
0439023513|5.0|First of all, I must say that this book is absolutely, without any shade of a doubt, amazing! I was flabbergasted (oh, I love the English language) at every twist and turn; nothing was predictable; nothing like this was ever written before (as far as I know)!   Now let's go to the real review:  It took me a long time to read this (almost a week! Longer than I expected, although I'm certain some of you might find this quite fast), and I'm glad it did. This book was better than any ice-cream or candy, it provides so much food for thought, one just must stop after every fifty or so pages, just to process everything.   Many characters die in this book, I must say. This is to be expected, obviously, since it is a book about a revolution. But what makes their deaths breathtaking is the gruesome manner in which they parish. I can't think of one death described in detail (even in a few words) that was not horrific in its manner and shocking due to the way Katniss describes them. Not to be cruel, but most characters in this book deserved to die (or their deaths, at least, were of importance to the revolution). Not because of their  acts, but simply because of the roles they played in the revolution. For example, and this is not a spoiler, many believed Peeta would die in this book simply because he is the sacrificial lamb. Nothing wrong with him, quite on the contrary, but the role he played was doomed to death. I didn't say he died in the book, and I didn't say he didn't; you'll just have to read and see.  Back to my point, most characters were doomed to death from the beginning, but some characters who did die... boy, expect some teary eyes! There were characters I could not believe Suzanne Collins killed! Yeah, I know, their deaths were important, bla bla bla, but... too sad...   Don't take me wrong! There were some happy moments in the book. Moments that just made you smile and think that maybe, just maybe, everything is going to be OK.   The reason why this book isn't for everyone is the following: It is not written by The Girl Who Was of Fire, neither is it written by Katniss Everdeen the Great. It is quite simply written by the 17 year old girl she is. A girl who had been through unspeakably things, seen horrific sights, and did not come out unscratched. Yes, she has an emotional meltdown more than once in this book. Yes, she is unwilling, and almost scared to fight Snow and the Capitol. But NO, she doesn't back down! Katniss writes down her personality exactly as it is, with all its flaws and imperfections, which make her quite perfect and unique, if you ask me.You'll probably think, more than once, 'why did she do/didn't do that??' or 'I would have done something different'. Believe me, I thought the same. But lets ask ourselves, would we be able to live through what she lived, knowing we have been used and abused, our love is probably being tortured as we speak, our whole district, with its people, was burned down to the ground, all to send us and the revolution we sparked a message, and then keep on walking like nothing has happened? Would we still act brave, still dare to take risks? I know my answer, and I hope I really could stick to it if this ever were to happen to me, but what is your answer?   Another reason that this book is not for everyone, just thought of it =D, is that The Hunger Games is not centered around the revolution itself. Truly, the revolution is described almost fleetingly, like it's a sub-plot. Which it's not. The reason why the revolution is described like that is because this book is originally centered around one girl, Katniss. The revolution, for her, has its clear and hazy parts. You will see that every moment described is significant in a way, and every moment not described has its own meaning, and is usually blurred because Katniss was just too detached to live it. This technique is actually quite ingenious! Every soldier you ask will tell you that the war itself goes by in a haze. It is those moments, when they stay up all night in their tents expecting to die any second, or when they kill or watch their friends die, that are engraved in their memories. Just frames of time locked forever in their nightmares, just like Katniss.  Well, lets cut this short:  The story is original, action packed (second half mostly), mind blowing, and will probably keep on hunting my nights for at least a month. If you are weak of heart, be warned.If you expected a Soldier Katniss, Leader and Head of the Revolution, then sorry, but you just might love this book anyway.   This book is recommended to EVERYONE! and Suzanne Collins, my hat off to you!
0439023513|5.0|I felt overall this was an accurate portrayal of war and its aftermath. She didn't sugar-coat or simplify. The way she showed the mental impact of violence seemed realistic: as a terrible struggle but one that can be overcome. I didn't feel like the characters were flat at all, but rather nuanced, and even the minor characters like Boggs and Coin were given real personalities instead of being caricatures. I think it's unfortunate that so much attention is being paid to the love triangle -- all this \\"Team\\" nonsense, since it's pretty tangential to the thrust of the story, and maybe the one failing of the books is that she prolonged \\"the choice\\" for so long and only fed this.     Collins gave us a lot to chew on with this one about the impact of war, the pitfalls of power, and how in our media-rich age pretty much everything can be manipulated. I'm not sure I can bring myself to re-read it because it was so violent in parts, but I know I'm going to be thinking about it for a long time.

To date by far the best of his many quality works. The best part is that a DVD is included, and gives the viewer a up close and personal concert with the Masters. You'll apprecite this young man for what he's done for the Blues community, I wish him well.
0671042858|4.0|I've read an awful lot of Stephen King, and liked most of it. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is not his best, but it's far from his worst. It's got all the usual King themes, but he goes relatively light on the horror and mayhem in this one, since it's essentially just a story about a little girl lost in the woods. It's a quick read with a fairly unremarkable ending.
0345472322|5.0|A fantastic message of two ways to look at life.  The Fixed mindset is a PRIDEFULL mindset. The Growth mindset is a HUMBLE mindset. As Carol Dweck points out Praise can help in developing one or the other mindset. When your mindset is fixed it can be puffed up or deflated. Both are poor coping skills during the hardships of life. With a Growth mindset we can grow stronger and stronger in coping with lifes challenges. Praise can and will direct our focus on one mindset or the other. Excellent book inspight of the very few quotes containing bad language.

0763644765|5.0|The arrival of Potty couldn't be more perfect.  My husband and I are just starting to introduce the idea of potty training to our two year old who's recently shown some interest. My son is already a huge fan of Yummy Yucky and No No Yes Yes, both on regular rotation as bedtime reads.  Since Potty arrived in the mail two days ago, both my husband and I have read it over fifty times. As soon as the last page is turned, my son will ask for us to read it to him again.  With its bright and humorous graphics and simple wording, Potty is a perfect book for introducing a little one to the idea of potty training.  It's not overwhelming like some children's books which can be loaded down with words and too many graphics. Instead, Patricelli's books capture kids because they are simple, to the point, humorous, and engaging.  Kids get Patricelli, and Leslie Patricelli gets kids.

The interviews are spectacular, the live clips are totally awesome, and the human story of their amazing journey into our culture - indeed, the WORLD'S culture - is the stuff of legend.  When they stop making music or stop touring I will be shedding tears.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Reading this book for me made it cool to read again. The author Stieg Larsson presented us a very entertaining and 'edge of seat' novel. Reading it brought me to Sweden a place i have never visited but now from reading this book would love to one day visit.<br />I felt as if i was watching a movie instead of reading, with each line the climax got thicker and thicker, I never knew what to expect next. Until boom!!!! the drama unfolded.<br />This is a must read by everyone, you will not have wasted your money,trust me it is that good.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If I had to choose only one DVD to keep from my vast collection, this would be it. Watched it and loved it numerous times, and will continue to watch it again and again. This is that rare instance when a movie is actually better than a book. Highly recommended.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|This cooler certainly functions very well...keeping my OC'd i5-750 under 72c when running PRIME95. However as soon as I removed the cooler from its box the very top cooling fin fell right off..I didn't bother putting it back on. I did not want it falling off inside the case and shorting out god-knows-what. Additionally the holes for the 1156 postion on the back plate were not drilled big enough to accept the standoffs. I had to manually pry them open a little bit. So while the Hyper 212+ cools well enough the quality control issues I had befit its under $30 price.
B0031PQSAC|4.0|One of my favorite things in this book, which is called diary of a wimpy kid (rodrick rules) is that it is a very good book well a, diary.  It starts up that rodrick bullies his own brother and his brother bullies his little brother. Manny who is the smallest brother made the middle brother a ball of cotton and the middle brother wanted to throw it away and his mom said \\"no don't throw it away your brother made that for you!\\" The middle boy who I don't know his name because it did not say it in the book bullied his friend well not actually his friend because he didn't like him. So he bullied a boy named chirag and chirag's dad got mad and the boy's mom told him to go say sorry. In the middle it was about his friends and bulling.<br />  Rodrick and their brother got along. His friends got along to and they did not leave Rowley out of the group. chirag and his band finally got the beat. The boy became popular and his mom didn't understand him because the boy was in the age like 12 years old or something like that.<br />  chirag and the boy were good friends and now Rowley was the bully. Diary of a wimpy kid stories are awesome because they show you things you don't know And they sometimes they show you bad things like bulling but at the end it tells you why not to bully that's why there're books.  That's why I did this book review.
0545140315|3.0|The Lonely Hearts Club follows the story of Penny Lane Bloom (yes, she is named for a Beatles song, as are her two sisters, Rita and Lucy) as she gets her heart ripped out and stomped on by the boy of her dreams, Nate, right before the start of her Junior year in high school. Determined to never let it happen again, Penny swears off dating...and boys...at least until she is done with high school. So, she starts a club called The Lonely Hearts Club (and yes, this is also a Beatles reference). While her friend Tracy thinks the idea is foolish and resorts to her list of possible hookups for the year, Penny is surprised not so surprised to find out there are more girls who want to join her club. There's only one problem - Penny might just be falling for someone, and she is leading a club that says she can't.<br /><br />Ok, I heard excellent things about this book, so I went in with an open mind. Elizabeth Eulberg who, by the way, is Stephanie Meyer's publicist, undoubtedly has talent. Her writing is short, clean, and easy to follow at a nice pace. That said, I have to admit if I heard the phrase \\"what to the evs\\" one more time, I was going to shred this book. I also had a bit of a problem with just how scream-y and squeal-y these girls were. It seemed like every single action warranted a scream of sorts.<br /><br />Perhaps it just didn't ring true for me because this was nothing like my high school experience, but I also found it hard to believe that the popular girl (Diane) who ignored Penny for years because of a boyfriend suddenly went back to her begging for forgiveness. In all honesty, I've never seen that happen...teenage girls find it very hard to let the guard down around other teenage girls. Also, a ton of characters were introduced right off the bat, and it was a tad distracting to follow until you actually got into the story.<br /><br />It was a fluffy read, plain and simple. It's not deep, no worlds were created to lose yourself in, and frankly, it's not a completely original idea. I think it's meant to inspire girls to strike out on their own, rather than depend on boys, but I felt it fell a bit flat. I give this book a 3 out of 5, and I'd recommend it to those who enjoy books like The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.I think it's meant to inspire girls to strike out on their own, rather than depend on boys, but I felt it fell a bit flat.

B001S33D1G|5.0|This fantasy is both thrilling and electrifying. People that enjoy magical stories like this one, will be ecstatic about this story. In the beginning there is a young girl about 5'4\\" moving into a mansion called the flat with her parents. It was about 12:00 in the after noon when Coraline's dad told her to explore the house. She jotted down all the windows, doors and pictures. When a young boy named Whybie, short for Whyborn, comes to her and gives her a doll that looks exactly like Coraline. As she was exploring the house she found a tiny locked door. She was curious about it. She tries to get her mom to open the door but behind it is just a bricked wall. But what Coraline doesn't know, is that behind this puny door is treacherous place. In the middle of the night, Coraline was awaken by a mouse, which leads her to the little door. When she opened it she found something so tremendous. The door wasn't bricked up any more. Coraline crawled threw it to find that the door led her right back to her own living room. She was confused; she thought it would be diverse. As she strolled around she saw her mom cooking. But when her mother turned around she realized it wasn't. This strange old woman had button eyes, but looked exactly like Coralines mom.<br /><br />  Coraline didn't know what was going on. The woman told Coraline she is her other mother. Coraline believed her but knew something was wrong. Then Coraline found her dad he had buttoned eyes as well. After dinner she went to her room and saw everything was abnormal. All of her toys were alive; Coraline couldn't believe her eyes. She loved this new place; Coraline went to bed and then woke up to see she was back in her old home. She told her parents about her experience but they thought she was hallucinating. Coraline knows what she saw and still she kept going through that door. Until one day she went in that door one more time and her other mother and father asked her if she wanted button eyes. Coraline yelled \\"NO\\" she didn't want buttons on her eyes. When she went to sleep that night, she was extremely scared but never wanted to come back.<br />When she woke up she was still in the same place. She didn't know what was happening so she made the other mother a deal that if she finds 3 ghost eyes she gets to leave they both agreed and Coraline set out to find these ghost eyes. Coraline is very curious and she's not afraid of anything. Will Coraline find these ghost eyes?

0525421580|4.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson, though hard to describe, was truly brilliant. The books is about two boys, both named Will Grayson, who happen upon each other and despite their very different backgrounds, come together and spin a story about life, love, and the truth that's within all of us.<br /><br />The book is written by both John Green and David Levithan. Each author created the world of their Will Grayson. John Green's Will Grayson is a nerdy, geeky, dorky, and endearing teen who pretty much embodies the stereotypical teen boy. David Levithan's Will Grayson is a bit more out of the ordinary. He struggles with depression and the need for mood-stabilizing pills. The stark contrast between the two Will Graysons makes this a coming-of-age book that almost anyone could relate to.<br /><br />It's beautifully written, each Will Grayson has a distinct voice (the chapters alternate, and one is written without any caps). To be honest though, parts of the book are cheesy and completely over-the-top - especially the end. That said, this book is sweet, about love above all else, and you will either love it or hate it. I choose to really love it, though I'm sure there are plenty of people aggravated by the completely unbelievable nature of the end.<br /><br />I give it a strong 4 out of 5, and I'd recommend Will Grayson, Will Grayson to anyone looking for a unique, fun, and feel-good book.
6305841861|5.0|Attention S-Mart shoppers, you must watch this movie!<br /><br />While the original [[ASIN:B000WC3864 Evil Dead]] put a young Sam Raimi on the directors map, I feel that the second installment the better of the too. It's essentially the same film done bigger budget and more highly developed sense of the absurd. [[ASIN:0783227434 Evil Dead - Army of Darkness]], will always be may favorite of the series for it's sheer outlandishness, but I think Evil Dead II is the classic, and should be viewed before Army of Darkness so that the latter can be properly appreciated. The first was almost pure horror. The third was almost pure comedy. Evil Dead II strikes the perfect balance between the two.<br /><br />The premise is simple, your standard horror fare. A group of teen take a trip to a dilapidated cabin the woods. They unleash otherworldly demonic forces from the Book of the Dead, and spend the rest of the movie either becoming possessed by them or fighting them off or being killed by them in disgustingly creative ways . The only member of the group that doesn't succumb is Ash, played to the maniacal hilt by the always wonderful Bruce Campbell. He kicks some undead butt and looks good doing it.<br /><br />ED II is a swirling maelstrom of tension, laughs, jump-out-of-your-seat frights, more laughs, and more gore than you can shake a stick at. There are classic scenes like the zombie in the basement, eye-ball in the mouth and possessed hand than get me every time.<br /><br />This review is for the 2000 Anchor Bay DVD with the great commentary track. I've seen the Blu-ray transfer and it really isn't a major improvement over the DVD audio and video. Rabid fans may want to track down the [[ASIN:B000AQKU6I Book Of The Dead Collection]], with it's Necronomicon Ex-Mortis packaging. One of them screams when you press the eyeball! :D There are some nice extras too. True fans of the horror genre should have this cult classic in their collection, no matter what version it is. Chances are you have a copy or have at least seen it once in your life. If not, you're in for a really bloody treat. I know I always dust mine off come October...least seen it once in your life. If not, you're in for a really bloody treat. I know I always dust mine off come October...
B001SRC9P8|4.0|Ok, let me get this out of the way before I say anything else: I am really not a fan of the show, Pretty Little Liars. I think the acting is atrocious, and I think they've made it into a glorified Gossip Girl for ABC Family. That, in a nutshell, is why I almost never read this book. Now that that's out of the way, I'll get onto the review.<br /><br />Pretty Little Liars follows the story of four girls, Hanna, Spencer, Aria, and Emily, as they make their way through the junior year of high school in the wake of their best friend, Alison's, disappearance. Alison was the ringleader, and the girls flocked around her, but now that she's gone, secrets that were meant to remain hidden are surfacing again, and a mysterious person that simply calls herself/himself \\"A\\" is hell-bent on getting their attention by whatever means necessary. Is it possible that \\"A\\" really is Alison, and if so, why is she trying so hard to ruin the other girls' lives?<br /><br />Frankly, I didn't like high school for many of the reasons I was reminded of while reading Pretty Little Liars. Girls are catty, and high school is cruel, but this book takes it to the next level when Alison, who was once a best friend to Spencer, Aria, Hanna, and Emily, seeks only to pull them down. That said, I liked the pace of Pretty Little Liars. The story is fluid and, while ridiculously easy to read, it's entertaining - far more entertaining than that shitshow on TV by the same name.
B003JTHESA|5.0|WOW ! I admit I'm a bigger Bruce Dickinson fan than Maiden(he actually knows how to sing and doesn't growl)and in my opinion his solo stuff (written mostly with Roy Z)was alot better than Maiden's. But Maiden's last 3 albums have me rethinking that. Check out his solo stuff if you haven't.  For alot of us, some of the most simple and memorable tunes ever etched in Metal history have come from Maiden.  So what are you going to say about a group that has pumped out music for 30 years, 15 studio albums and sold over 80 million albums worldwide !? Iron Maiden is one of the biggest bands in South America, Asia and Europe. Do we need to critique them or just appreciate them ? There are 5 out of the 15 albums that I don't care for but that's still 10 that I do like and that's pretty good in my book. We know that 14-16 year old girls decide what the U.S. listens to but a small stronghold still exists in the states and while Lady Ga Ga, American Dribble..I mean Idol and talentless hiphop rule the states the rest of the world makes it possible to have great bands exist since they still buy Metal by the millions.  I for one believe that Maiden's albums have gotten better ( Fear Of The Dark Is my personal favorite ) The classics were of course in the 80's but I feel like the early albums (the 80's)have the great 2 or 3 songs per album but overall were weaker albums than what they are producing now.    Brave New World and A Matter Of Life And Death (there last album 4 years ago) were very good efforts in their own right. The Final Frontier is certainly among Iron Maiden's best.   The Final Frontier starts off uncharacteristically with a building intro Satellite 15...The Final Frontier which is really like 2 songs in one. I like the first part alot but The Final Frontier part lays there for me and is the worst part of the album but still listenable. 2) El Dorado starts off with a Barracuda like riff and Dickinson's lyrics are apparent as the chorus sounds almost identical to TheMagician from Bruce's solo work. I like the killer guitar solo on this one and overall I find this one of the more powerful tunes. 3)Mother Of Mercy starts with familiar unmistakable Smith/Harris guitar and moves into classic Maidenisque 80's like verse music and then into a good solo before returning back to verse and chorus. 4)Coming Home (don't care too much for the intro and thankfully it turns direction)Softer verses with the chorus picking up steam and though this sounds like several other Maiden tunes it's got enough twist to make it interesting. Beautiful and long guitar work before moving back to Dickinson's operatic singing. 5)The Alchemist is an uptempo Harris offering with Gers and Dickinson contributing. Nothing spectacular but just a straight forward in your face rock song. Another great guitar solo. 2nd weakest song but still listenable.  6) Isle Of Avalon took me some time to like but man does this thing just go in alot of directions ! It's  over 9 minutes long and jams out. I'd love to hear it live. If you like Dream Theatre it has some of that feel to it but keeping the familiar Maiden form. 7)Starblind is Smith/Harris at their creative best and Dickinson writing the lyrics. Starts really good and gets better going off track for a short time. This is one of the best on the album for me and again would sound great in concert. I've liked this one more each time I've listened. 8)The Talisman has a rather long slow beginning and then kicks into a Gers/Harris gallop that is signature Maiden and really doesn't stray from that until towards the end for a short time. Another epic 9 minute offering that gets a bit drawn out at the end.9)The Man Who Would Be King is the only song that has Dave Murray contributing. I've always like Murray's stuff. Still has Harris familiar signature on it.10)When The Wild Wind Blows. Plenty of stuff that sounds like previous Maiden but with a twist that goes in a direction that you did not see coming. Over 10 minutes of goodmusic to finish off a very good album.  What I love about recent albums from Maiden is that they put out these long 8 to 10 minute songs and it doesn't feel like it. Before you know it you've just spent over an hour listening and saying to yourself \\"WOW\\". These guys did not phone this in. This is a great effort. There's alot of bands that could learn from them. May not be the best album for popping in and listening to one or 2 songs but if you've got the time to sit through over an hour plus of just good music then this is the album to listen to. Could argue album of the year. Easiliy in the top 3 for me.
0316044938|5.0|The Lovely Bones follows Susie Salmon, a perpetually teenage girl stuck in the equivalent of limbo after she was brutally assaulted and murdered by her neighbor in the cornfield behind her house.<br /><br />I'm not usually into ghost stories, so this was a riveting and refreshing twist. Susie Salmon is in the In Between, stuck between life and eternal peace because she can't stop watching her family, or let go of the fact that she was murdered and nobody knows who did it. She watches her sister and brother grow older, her parents' marriage fall apart, her grandmother let down her defenses and mourn for her granddaughter.<br /><br />The story is vivid and alive and Susie's voice, as the narrator, is just perfect. You can feel her distress and the torment that won't let her go. It broke my heart to know that the first love she ever felt was snatched away when her life was. I also have to admit, I love when she learned to step outside her safe little limbo and experience love.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of my all-time favourite reads. While the ending was a little abrupt for my liking, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of just desserts.
0553381687|5.0|My feeling is that the only legitimate critiques of this book are that the series is not yet finished and that the fourth novel is not quite as strong as the first three. This book is outstanding primarily in terms of the plot depth and breadth.
B003V5PPZG|3.0|I realize how bands need to grow and extend their fanbase and mature as a band, but this CD is a major step down from Minutes to Midnight. I loved Minutes to Midnight, but this album doesn't hold up to any kind of quality test. It's very repetitive and boring. It doesn't sound like Linkin Park, not even a little. It has it's moments like Blackout which is why it gets 3 stars instead of 2. I love Linkin Park and will get their next album out of loyalty, but this one just doesn't stand up to any kind of test of high quality music I have come to expect from Linkin Park. The lyrics are not up to par for an LP album. I'm fine with changing styles a little and maturing like Green Day did with Warning or Incubus did with albums after SCIENCE, but this just takes it way too far away from the original heart and soul of Linkin Park. Listen to this CD before getting it is my suggestion
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was actually quite surprised that I liked STAR TREK as much as I did. My son gave this to me for Christmas, and I've probably watched it a half a dozen times since then. I actually am old enough to have watched the original STAR TREK TV series when it was new. I have, of course, seen the other STAR TREK movies, but this one is the best of the lot by far.<br /><br />I like how the story shows the backgrounds of the major characters and how they first got together. Of course, this all happens in an alternative universe disrupted by the actions of some rogue aliens (you'll have to watch to see what I'm talking about).<br /><br />In any case, I think that the casting and storyline in this film are both good. The effects are top-notch, and the soundtrack is fantastic.<br /><br />I like the action, the story, the cast, and, well, just about everything about it.<br /><br />5 stars all the way.
B00005AG7K|1.0|After making A HARD DAYS NIGHT and HELP, the Beatles felt that they could come up with a better film on their own.  They were wrong.  The result was MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. This film was shown on TV in the U.S. I remember watching it when I was in High School. There were weeks of aniticipation as the network advertised it, but it was ultimately a big letdown. The songs were good, but the story was very poor. If you have the original release of the vinyl record album, it contains a book with the story of the film. Only the story in the record album is somewhat changed around, with various scenes in a different order, some additional outrageous craziness, and it makes a lot more sense! If the film had followed the written story, it would have been more of a success. I have been collecting home movies for a long, long time. When I started, you could only get films on actual movie film: 16mm, 8mm and super-8mm. I have a complete copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, in color, on super-8mm film with a magnetic sound track that I bought in the 70s. This was THE First Official release of the film for the home market. It has a much better quality picture than the present DVD, which is horrible. The film has strong colors, good contrast and almost no scratches.  No matter what format you get it in, this is mostly just a curiosity; a slice of 60s history.

0786956291|3.0|So I've read through and examined all the contents (a sample copy) and here's what you need to know. The Red Box is NOT a \\"basic\\" set, in that it would provide you everything you need to create a character and play through at least 3 or more levels of the game. This is not at all like any of the basic sets that TSR or Wizards of the Coast have published to introduce new players to D&D.    It IS a \\"starter\\" set, in that it will be a good intro for new players or those new to 4th Edition D&D. As a starter set, it excels by giving you a run-through adventure, a Dungeon Master book, cardstock counters, a map, etc. to learn the game. The quality of the kit is not in line with the previous 3.0+ D&D box sets, (this set has flimsy cardstock and uses counters instead of miniatures) but the price is right for what you get--especially on Amazon.     Main Strength?  I'm not a 4E fan per se, but there's a lot to like with this introductory set, that simplifies the rules and provides a very easy to grasp description of the main game elements. It would make an excellent gift for someone who might be interested in trying the game (great for kids).    Main Weakness?  The main downfall is that once you understand the game, you're never going to need it again. It's a springboard and little else. You'll need to buy the [[ASIN:0786956216 Dungeons & Dragons Rules Compendium]] anyway. In that sense, it makes this box crippleware, but really good-looking, fun to unwrap crippleware!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Bon Iver is going to be a timeless artist down the road. Having these songs on Vinyl made it even better than I expected. Pretty nostalgic to have it in this form. Love Bon Iver, love the Vinyl. Don't miss this, people!
B002RWKSII|5.0|Lo mejor que ha hecho Brian desde los Beach Boys. Es gratificante saber que aún se pueden encontrar discos como éste.
0553805371|3.0|While interesting, the lack of a defined audience makes this book an extremely difficult read.<br /><br />Having read A Brief History of Time I was looking for something with a similar feel to it. Instead the book starts out geared towards anyone with the desire to really read and understand it, then seems to leave most of that audience towards the wayside - seemingly right around when the science gets a little iffy - and then finishes geared back towards the larger audience.<br /><br />But perhaps the audience isn't as large as I've thought. But why then, in one of these 'higher level' sections do we see jokes added within the text?<br /><br />Perhaps the authors realized that the theory they state within is too complex for most people, and this is their way of making it bearable for us, until things start getting more understandable.<br /><br />Either way, while I generally enjoyed the book, and found many noteworthy passages, the ideas expressed within still need some work to be generally accessible. While I'll certainly re-read a Stephen Hawking book, it is unlikely that it will be this one, so I give it 3 of 5 stars.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I don't understand why this item has not shipped.  Is there a problem at my end or are you waiting for something else??
0439023513|3.0|I think this book could have been better. I thought the first two books in the series were written very well and expected the best for last, but it missed my expectations. It seemed to have a lot of \\"filler\\" parts in it, so when I finished the book it made me wonder \\"what was the point\\". I think Susanne Collins is a great writer, but I wonder if she just didn't have it in her to write this last book or was pressured to finish it to soon.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|IT'S A GREAT MOVIE SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE AFTERMATH OF \\"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED\\" BY GW BUSH. IT'S WORTH WATCHING.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILER  Let me start by saying that I don't care for fairytale endings. I love a good, well thought out book as much as anybody, whether or not it ends \\"happily\\". The only thing I can't stand are rushed endings and underdeveloped characters. This book had both.   I had some excitement leading up to this book, although honestly, I had been disappointed with the endings of both of the previous books (due to their rushed and contrived endings.) However, after staying up late to finish this book, I deemed it the worst of the series. Collins trudges through the first two sections of the book, often boring me with yet another scene of Katniss blacking out and waking up in the hospital (did anyone else feel a \\"soap opera\\" vibe to this book?) and when she came to the final and most important section, she runs through it at a break neck speed, often losing the reader by jumping from one undeveloped death of an important character to another. I believe I have heard that she likes to write her books in three \\"acts,\\" but I hate that she feels like she has to make all the acts the same size. Give proper attention where attention is due.   I don't mind that Katniss lives out her days in depression, or that she dumps Gale and marries Peeta (saw that coming a mile off,)but I do mind that I didn't even care anymore. It was just another thrown together section of a thrown together ending. I was so frustrated.
0789208547|1.0|Basically this seems like reproductions of the covers of the magazine rather than the paintings themselves.  I saw the Norman Rockwell exhibit at the museum a year ago.   I was largely unfamiliar with his work and always thought his stuff was kind of cheesy, I mean they were featured on long john silvers cups and plates.  Seeing his paintings live made me a eternal fan, I went back 4 times!  Naturally I had to have this book and after the first review said it was \\"the\\" book to have, done deal.  Well I got mine today and when I opened the book I turned my head in horror.    The paintings depicted in this book lack the contrast and the correct colors of the original paintings.  It's like all the soul and magic was sucked out of the images.  It's a big and nice book and maybe I'm spoiled but I'm sure the artist would be pissed seeing his paintings depicted in this manner.  Take the image on the cover.  This one really stood out to me in the museum.  It was painted so brilliantly with smooth buttery strokes and it had the cool shadows to contrast the warm skin tones. It was all lost.  Its all wrong. I really wanted this book to be good so badly to feel some of what I felt when I saw these awesome paintings.  Sorry, I'm sending mine back.  **NOTE**  It does say 332 magazine covers not 332 paintings so I sort of got what I paid for.  Perhaps the guy couldn't get access to the originals.  There where a bunch of words in the book maybe it said something about that.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|I've always liked DeCaprio in the Aviator, and think it runs a fine line through the life of Howard Hughes, even though I'm not sure how his life turned out after the ending scene in 1947, but more than 2 hours of the movie captures the affects of his accomplishments in a brilliant way, with people telling Hughes stuff like, \\"Don't put any more money into this movie!\\" or \\"Listen to what the Senate has to say and sell TWA to cut our losses.\\" But Hughes never gave up, and the movie is a must-see performance to those who need to be encouraged to keep their own dreams as well.<br /><br />When I placed the order, it took a lengthy amount of time waiting for the movie to finally arrive, but when it did, it was in first-class condition, and the wrapping wasn't even off the cover. Thanks, Amazon!
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Another strong offering from Plant!  Part folk songs (but with a distinctly modern edge), part brooding dark and gorgeous ballads, this continues to showcase his enormous talent and diversity.  His voice just seems to improve over time in a way that Bob Dylan must envy!  You can definitely distinguish the influence of his work with T-Bone Burnett as well.  Over all this is a fantastic album, although Zep fans should beware, as they probably know by now anyway, that this is a far cry from Led Zep IV.  It is much closer to Led Zep III which has always been one of my favorite Zep albums.
0812550706|4.0|I'm not sure how I've never made the time to read Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\". It came to my attention about 15 years ago because of it's prescient inclusion of something like the Internet - a supercomputing, connected and communication experience. Viewing Ender's \\"desk\\" through the lens of 2010, one can't help but also applaud Card's anticipation of the iPad.    The book is not standard sci-fi fare. Oh, it has its aliens (called \\"buggers\\" throughout the book), space- ships, travel, and battles, but it has much more than that. It has a unique depth. After reading it, I see now why schools are including it on their reading lists.    Ender is a genius. A six-year-old genius. It becomes clear early in the book that Ender's intelligence is ridiculously off the charts, even by the standards of Card's fictional future. Card's mastery is on full display in how deep and dimensional he's able to make the characters. Like many children who have some distinguishing characteristic, whether it's a good or bad, Ender finds those characteristics under attack. He's very withdrawn, insecure and closed off to most of the real world. I couldn't help but feel Ender's claustrophobic view of his world.I couldn't help but feel his anger, frustration and outrage.    I'm looking forward to reading more on Ender Wiggin. But like Ender, I need to step away for a while. I need some fresh air. I need to stretch out and catch my breath before I re-enter Ender's game...and Orson Scott Card's world.
B001QBC4AG|5.0|If you're reading reviews of this \\"deluxe\\" version of a 900-year-old album, you're probably wondering if you should buy yet another flooking Who album. The short answer, \\"Hellz Yessir!\\" The 95 cd sounds inferior to this one in every way imaginable. The original mix is better in both stereo and mono. The mastering is a little louder, but dynamics don't seem to be affected. Just buy it.     The only thing wrong with this version is that they left off \\"glow girl\\" and \\"melancholia.\\" But we all bought the cd that came out fifteen years ago--the one with the two aforementioned bonus tracks--because we are all a bunch of one-foot-in-the-grave codgers. eff it all to smell.
B002RWKSII|2.0|I listened to the album from my Rhapsody account, so I did not have to purchase it independently.  As some of the negative reviews have stated, there is noting special here; rather, it's a novelty: what if BW sang some ol'Gershwin songs with a light rockin' South Bay, surfer, Beach Boys feel, plus some Smilish (\\"my prayer\\") grand renderings of Gershwin's more \\"long-hair\\" compositions?  The result is that we get some dated ditties from Gershwin sung with a weakly BB feel. Only those committed to Brian --at any critical cost--and only scholars and historians of jazz will rave about this because they think they are \\"supposed to.\\"  It pains me to say all this, but despite the heraldry of joining these two major figures of songwriting, the emperor has no clothes.  Heavens, is anyone listening to songs from Porgy and Bess today?  In any rendition?  By contrast, I have been savoring Al Jardine's Postcard from California,\\" which is by all accounts a much better album--more energy, more soul, more spirit, and, most importantly, real Beach Boys, playing and singing together (in various manifestations); a single verse of Al and Brian harmonizing on \\"Drivin\\" warms the heart more than all of BWRG. And, of course, any moment of Smile (in its scattered BB recordings across albums), and any random moment from Friends, or Sunflower or Surf's Up will remind you of what the BB were.
B0019NB9A2|3.0|The Blu-Ray edition of this classic is rather disappointing. It's a double-layer BR disc, but the whole package uses about 32 gigs and LESS THAN 20 gigs are devoted to the feature. As with all Cinemascope pictures, the camera negative is compressed and the uncompressed screen image is fuzzier than standard ratio films of the period. The upshot is the feature looks only marginally better than the DVD. The HD soundtrack, mastered from the original four-track recordings, has never sounded better, though. \\"Invisible Boy\\" and all the other material on the second disc of the two-disc DVD has been ported over and most of it is not in hi-def.
1439181780|3.0|I enjoyed \\"The Secret\\" and so I thought I would enjoy \\"The Power\\". I was a little disappointed by the superficiality of the book however. I thought that many concepts were just mentioned briefly and never actually explained, far from any practical information on the subject. I felt like I found what I was looking for in a different book recommended to me by a friend: [[ASIN:1451594364 Read Me - I Am Magical: Open Me and I Will Reveal 12 Secrets to Love, Happiness & Personal Power. As You Leaf Through Me See How Remarkable You Feel]], which is much more straight to the point and gives quick and powerful mental exercises which change your life for the better.
030745455X|5.0|Like the first book, this one is very suspenseful. I could not stop myself from worrying about Salander on an almost personal level. The ending left me yearning for more, and I immediately went to the store and purchased the third upon reading it. Larsson had a knack for surprises, and although I consider myself pretty decent at predicting outcomes of books, I found my jaw dropping many times throughout this trilogy.
0307454541|5.0|Although many people mentioned that they felt that this trilogy involved extremely one-dimensional characters, I felt that the characters were intricate enough. Although they were sometimes somewhat predictable, you find yourself becoming very attached to some of them. It is hard to refrain from getting caught up in the characters, and several times I wanted to yell at the people involved. This book, along with the other two in the trilogy are written with so much suspense that I found myself bringing them with me through every room of my house. I didn't find the plot predictable at all, and although the pace may seem a little slow at first (especially with this one) it felt so rewarding to get to the end when everything is finally revealed. For me this book was such a build-up and there were so many suspects that my head was spinning. I found that the same happens in the next two but once you get so involved with the characters, it is maddening to wonder what happens to them and you can't fly through the pages fast enough to ensure that the characters are safe. Another thing I might add is that some other reviewers felt that the books were very boring, but I suppose that has more to do with your interests. Much of the books deal with finance, political scandals, journalism, and corrupt businesses in general. I am not particularly interested in any of those things but I didn't feel that it took away from the plot at all, and I think that it all depends on how willing you are to look past those things to the real plot of the story. The beginning of this book picks up a little slow and you can't help but wonder where it is going, however, once the plot really starts, it goes full force. I personally thoroughly enjoyed them and I wish that the author was still alive to keep writing. A truly talented author.

I enjoyed reading about his escapades in Scotland and England before he came to the states and  he must have a few guardian angels watching over him for sure. He's been through a lot and baby, look at him now.
B001CDD84Y|3.0|Pretty fun movie.<br /><br />Special Effects - 7 out of 10 (fun - fun - fun)<br />Casting/Acting - 5 out of 10 (the casting and acting was so-so but, still ok)<br />Plot - 3 out of 10 (a little simple but, still fun)<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth seeing. Especially if you're renting.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|sounds better than before, bonus tracks are worth the value. nothing more than that, really great, nice release
B00362DRPY|5.0|I don't know exactly why the reviews I read here often refer to a different type of media to the one they appear in. For the ones of you who are interested in the 2LP Seven and the ragged Tiger vinyl I can tell you the following.  I won't get into the artistic value, just the manufacturing quality.  It has a non gatefold cover, good quality printing. The inserts are made of printed paper and the records come straight inside the inserts and without anything else.  Sound? with my equipment sounds pretty good but I do have an old Australian re-issue to compare against. The comparison between the two show that this new 2LP issue has been equalized differently. It appears to have the higher frequencies lifted quite a bit. The bass however seems deeper and tighter on the older record. The old record seems to have more punch too, making this new issue sound like it may have been compressed a bit. Do not get me wrong, I don't think this issue will disappoint many people but personally I would have liked to know something like this before buying. Other than the slight shortage of dynamic range the LP sounds reasonably good.    The extra LP sounds very good. I personally like a lot the remixes of The reflex, New moon, Is there something? and the Union of the snake.  The vinyl used must be of good quality because at least to this point they are extremely quiet.  I have also bought the 2LP re-issues of Rio, Duran Duran and I am happy with both of them. I have been told that soon Big and Notorious will be released too.

159102594X|5.0|Joe Abercrombie is now a star on the rise after these books in my opinion.      It could be called a dark fantasy and is not something i recommend for children but it does not go too far with it's darker themes and tends to leave more to the imagination.  Very steeped in political intrigue with just the right hint of magic in a very well done unique world.  This is not your typical young hero must save the princess from the evil dragon story, the lines between good and evil are very gray.    I have read many many fantasy novels and this is now one of my top favorites of all time.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone age 16 and over.

B003V5PPZG|2.0|I own \\"Hybrid Theory\\", \\"Reanimation\\", \\"Meteora\\", and \\"Collision Course\\".  I admit that this does not make me an expert, however, I do know what I like.  As much as I want to like \\"A Thousand Suns\\" I can't.  The beats, power chords, screaming (everything I love about this band) are missing.  I want to get in my car and drive fast to fast music.  I need to vent, nod my head, bang on the steering wheel, and shout out lyrics I can relate to.  I can't do that with this cd.  I know this group isn't Metallica, Motorhead, or Prodigy, but this cd is too soft, and that isn't what I was looking for.  Is it different? Yes.  Do I wish them continued success? Yes.  However, this is an unwelcome departure from their previous cds, and I hope I can help someone avoid making the same mistake.
B00007GZQZ|1.0|My husband and I are doing a complete renovation so someone recommend we see this movie.  I was expecting it to be really funny but instead it just reminded me of one of the aweful 80's movie! Not funny and not a classic in my book.
0553381687|5.0|A couple years ago my friend gave me this book for my birthday. He loves it and couldn't wait for me to dive in. And I put it off. Because it's so long! The print is so small! It's from the fantasy section! I had waaaay too many excuses. Because I'm here to tell you, now that I finally picked it up, good golly it's great. Yeah, it's a good old-fashioned kings 'n swords epic (or the first book in the epic series - it ends exactly right in the middle of everything), and it's gripping stuff. No wonder it's a cult classic and adored by fantasy readers of every age. I bought the second one. It's longer. I can't wait.

0439023513|5.0|I'm trying to picture myself reading this final (brilliant) chapter of THE HUNGER GAMES as a parent.  I'm trying...  I'm trying...  Because this propulsive, cynical, violent tale of a future gone way wrong teaches lessons I don't know I want my kid to learn.  Or do I?  Question government.  Don't settle for the mass populace view.  War is avoidable, but only through difficult soul searching and sacrifice.  So, let me ask again - are those lessons necessary?  Probably.  Are they better than the lessons from 99.5% of the crap Hollywood is putting out?  Or network television?  Absolutely.  And would my kid be as entertained, as fingernail-less, as out of breath as I was when I finished?  He/she had better be.  The first two books were great; this one is off the charts.  It begins with a jolt and never lets up; dark territory explored with precision and thrilling brilliance.  I loved Harry Potter with a love that couldn't be contained; I respect Katniss Everdeen (the narrator and star of this trilogy) as well as fear her.  Is that better?  It's not worse.
B003V5PPZG|2.0|Apparently 2003 just will not stop calling because Staind, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and now, Linkin Park all have new albums out. On Linkin Park's new album \\"A Thousand Suns\\", dudes who genuinely like bleached tips and guitar players who wear headphones will find LP are up to their same old tricks.<br /><br />I'll give them credit that they are aiming for more of a Radiohead-Muse friendly sound this time around but that credit is does not amount to much. Their single \\"Catalyst\\" is just musically confusing. It never builds up, and it meanders in this stagnant beat that does not pay off. The album as a whole is like that.<br /><br />It's wannabe intellectualism from guys who used to be the poster children for uber-depressed, but mall-friendly rap-rock. For me, \\"A Thousand suns\\" is the sign of a sinking ship. It's a too little too late approach. As much as they tried to pull a Green Day and reinvent themselves, Billie Joe and Co. They are not.<br /><br />Sure, it has some moments of musical clarity, which more than likely came in the wake of their decision to work with Rick Rubin again. (Do you think he actually likes them or is he just cashing the giant check?) But, their desire to rap and sing over bloops and blips in a world where we've already seen bands like Refused write \\"The shape of punk to come\\" and seen M.I. A master free verse's over the world's oddest beats, the determination is dead in the water.<br /><br />This is in the press release for the record, and I almost doubled over from laughter from the band's self serving nonsense:<br /><br />We were not making an album.<br /><br />For months, we'd been destroying and rebuilding our band. The experiments that resulted filled the studio hard drive with diverse, abstract sounds. Amorphous echoes, cacophonous samples, and handmade staccato merged into wandering, elusive melody. Each track felt like a hallucination.<br /><br />Really dudes? If you wanna hear an album with \\"Diverse and abstract sounds\\" go pick up a copy of Shooter Jennings' Hierophant.<br /><br />Anyhow, for me to go completely into the record is a waste of time. It's an average album from a band that will still find a way to sell a few million copies of it. Trying to come up with acerbic descriptions as to why I think the album, and the band is lame, is like watching Family Guy and saying it sucks. The explanations defy logic.<br /><br />Somewhere a lonely girl in too much makeup is tweeting about how this album, changed her life. If that's the case, good for Linkin Park, but for everyone else, we're getting handjobbed into another year of crappy singles and spilled Budweiser from the people who will turn it up in their Nissan's.o completely into the record is a waste of time.

0439023491|4.0|Picking up right where she left off, Suzanne Collins largely avoids Sequel Slump with Book 2 of her Hunger Games Trilogy, and though it seems hardly possible, delivers a book that is even more propulsively readable than its fever-inducing predecessor.  Although the series won't conclude until August, it seems clear that she is delivering a great one-story-three-books hat trick, and though I may have one quibble about this middle child, it's a tiny one.  Without giving anything away, my only microscopic disappointment is that she invents a way to return to a major element of the first novel when it seems she has moved past it.  BUT.  She delivers it in such a completely new way, the quibble seriously evaporates like so much mist.  The only other problem?  The book ends and I have to wait three months to find out what happens next!  I may not survive the wait.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|I never thought in a million years that I would end up writing a negative review about a Keane album, but I have to say that this latest outing by the once fabulous Brit trio just plain SUCKS!  The only really fabulous song on this album is \\"My Shadow\\".  Why?  Because it is the ONLY SONG ON THIS ALBUM THAT EVEN REMOTELY SMACKS OF THEIR OLDER SOUND!!  The rest is just absulute garbage, save for \\"Help Yourself\\" which manages somehow to be at least likable, if not tolerable.  Keane really seem to be going on the same path that the Brit band of the 70's, Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)went during the early 80's--completely down the toilet.  ELO created some of the most amazing albums of all time during the 70's, with \\"A New World Record\\" being my all time favorite from 1976.  Then, when the late 70's and early eighties came around, ELO decided to leave their completely original, awesome sound and become total BEE GEES sellouts, as well as selling out to the completely artificial synthesizer \\"music\\" of the early and mid-80's, thus causing ELO to completely crash and burn, leaving many fans jumping ship, and rightly so.  By 1986, their last (and worst) album \\"Balance of Power\\" barely even got recognized and was very much as bad as this latest EP \\"Night Train\\" by Keane.    Keane, I suggest you find a really good muse or something, because you are definitely heading on the same path of self-destruction that ELO did in the 80's.    My advice to my fellow Keane fans is to just skip this album and switch over to the French band Phoenix instead.  So far, that band is just as good as when Keane first started out, and hopefully THEY won't end up taking the same disasterous path that Keane has taken lately.
0439023483|4.0|Brutal, challenging, entertaining and as gripping as anything I've read in recent (or maybe not-so-recent) memory, THE HUNGER GAMES is the first installment of a trilogy that you can find in the Young Adult section of the bookstore.  But don't let that stop you.  It is not, in any way, for children.  Yes, it's about them.  But good lord, it's not for them.  A bleak dystopian speculative novel about a chilling government-run game (think Stephen King's THE LONG MILE penned by, I dunno, J.K. Rowling comes to mind), I dare you to pick this up and not long to sit and read it in one go.  Even more, see if you can avoid rushing to the bookstore (as I did) to pick up the second book the second you finish.  And then begin worrying about what you'll do to bide the time until the last book comes out in four long months.  It's that good.  So make your way past the Paddington Bear shelves, somewhere above (in every way) the TWILIGHT books and get started.  Go.  Now.  Call me when you're done.

0312600844|2.0|Franzen will get rich now. Lady Oprah has given his novel Golden Go-Ahead Touch...  Character Driven. The End. Or wait - fly on wall? The reader plays 'I spy'? Personna Narrator is Patty's memoir? And then what? Walter and Patty's teenage son is ALLOWED to leave and live next door in a sustained sexual existence that is oh brother - way too difficult to believe? Is there any WASP/JEW parents out there, that are educated, middle class, responsible - that would ALLOW their teenage son to shack up with the 'girl next door'? The answer is NO.  And therefore, this Tomish Wolfish/Phillish Rothish novel is a complete and utter drag. It gave me a headache. I did not enjoy reading it. It made me sick.  And the half-hearted attempt to apply politics and ecology to the plot line was just that - an after-thought and whole heartedly a boring mistake. Warblers my foot. I mean I get it with the fence ending already and the use of the word 'freedom' to describe certain choices made by these cartoon characters. It didn't work for me.  Otherwise, the novel would have had a purity I could respect. A 1960's Peyton Place, John Cheever aura that would have sort of worked for me except that the narrator seemed to have ADDED and dropped characters like stones from the plot line, romping to South America and West Virginia and ignoring the opportunity to crown Patty the new and improved Anna Karenina/Scarlett O'hara.  Who exactly was the story about? Warblers?  Oh yes, it's all been written before. This time the subversive, degenerative tone just made me sick.  I do not recommend this self-absorbing piece of trash.

0439023513|5.0|I just finished all three and was pretty much blown away. And I think Mockingjay is my favorite. It was brutal and tough, the consequences of rebellion extremely high, and many of the turns were quite surprising and not always what I necessarily wanted. Yet it could not have ended more satisfyingly for me. Thematically, the scope and breadth of the novels, which Mockingjay brings home beautifully, is quite enormous. I'll be thinking about these books for a long, long time. But also from a story standpoint, the books are riveting, with very complex characters, all with flaws, all very human, all so worth the time. This will be a quick review as I don't want to give anything away. I'll say this, though... I was pretty much forced to read these, I did not really want to, and all I can say now is I hope they find an incredibly wide audience. They are worthy of Harry Potter type success.

B004132HZS|5.0|It's unfortunate that Amazon has a ratings limit, because this series is such a cut above the rest, allotting 'Sherlock' only five stars seems to be doing it a disservice.<br /><br />The writing is phenomenal, managing to update Conan Doyle's characters in a way that parallels the original with the modern instead of changing Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson to fit in the 21st century. Their personas are so recognizable that everything else that you assumed epitomized Holmes - the Victorian setting, the heavy smoking/pipes, the cliched deerstalker and Inverness - is quickly forgotten. Messrs Moffat and Gatiss have done a remarkable job proving that Sherlock Holmes was not, in fact, a product of the Victorian era, as even I suspected he might be, and they've not only updated a few of Doyle's own deductions, but have written in originals that rival those of the stories.<br /><br />A word on Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson, or Sherlock and John, as the case may be. Being that I read the Holmes Canon and had a precise mental image of him before ever seriously watching any adaptation, even the best Holmes actors have always been that - actors. Even Jeremy Brett took some getting used to. But Cumberbatch exudes Sherlock Holmes from every pore. He was my Holmes practically from the first twenty seconds he was on screen. Martin Freeman's Watson is fleshed out wonderfully, retaining the above average intelligence he was possessed of in the original stories, while not resorting to making him hostile or put-upon in the process. He's a loyal partner and friend, the most important person in Holmes' life and vice versa. He is no pushover by any means, but is in awe of Holmes and will do anything for him. Basically, he is ACD's Watson, just as Cumberbatch is Holmes of early Canon.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with this series, whether you are a stuffy purist Sherlockian or just looking for an entertaining mystery. It is brilliant and utterly delightful. My only gripe is the fact we only have three episodes.<br /><br />ETA: There has been speculation that this DVD set contained the edited versions aired on PBS's Masterpiece Mystery.

That really is not an issue, the problem is the performance. I have a MBPro 13 inch connected to a 22 inch LG display and from time to time the screen goes dark for a few seconds and another times it flickers a little bit. We bought 2 of these adapters at my office and they both suffer from the same problem. I have used the original Apple adapter with the same set up and nothing like that ever happened.
B002JWD6AS|2.0|ok so i was sittin at lunch and all my friends were talking about this book called'shiver'. i being the only one in the group to not read this book had to sit through all their comments on how glorious this book was.  seriously. they acted like it was the best thing since sliced bread or something. so yeah i read it.   and didnt like it. i know it goes along the whole werewolf thing (and seriously this werewolf/vampire/mysterious boy combo is REALLY gettin old) but the whole romance part of it was dry. i just wasnt felling it at all. really i could care less if sam stayed a werewolf for the rest of eternity. i mean really i got other things to worry about. but yeah nored me to death and believe me ive read some pretty boring books.  if anything borrow or rent...dont buy. not worth it.

The Final Frontier is a good song, but I think the intro Satellite 15 is worthless.  El Dorado is a good tune.  Coming Home is good as well.  I think the best material is at the end of the CD.  Tracks 8 through 10.  The talisman, The mans who would be king.  My favorite is When the wild wind blows.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I was worried about purchasing this set at first because of some early reviews I was reading.  Rest assured, the packaging is PHENOMINAL, and the content is AMAZING!  The only content that this set is missing is the season 4 webisodes, \\"The Face of the Enemy\\", which aren't on ANY compilation.  The Blu-ray picture is fantastic, and the sound is great.<br /><br />The inclusion of the extended Razor and a seperate Blu-ray of The Plan make this the most complete set that I've seen and could ever want.  Tons of extras and behind the scenes stuff makes for a truly complete BSG experience.<br /><br />So say we all.

It was so intersting to see such a young Mick Jagger (he wasn't even 30 I don't think) and Mick Taylor. Of course I heard plenty, but I never really saw too much of the Stones with Taylor on film. I really liked it. Love Jagger's moves and the Elvis-esque white sequin jumper he wears! Stones lovers will love it *of course*

B002ZG977Y|3.0|This remake of the Ray Harryhausen classic offers state-of-the-art special effects and a brisk pace to move the story along.<br /><br />Unfortunately characterization suffers.  And Sam Worthington may be a good actor, but he looks more like a soccer player or a marine here than a son of the gods.<br /><br />It appears that most of the budget for the film went to the special effects, which are admittedly pretty special.  The Kraken, giant scorpions, Pegasus, and Medusa in particular are something to see, a vast improvement over the charming but limited Harryhausen stop-motion creations of decades past.<br /><br />But the big-name cast is pretty limited: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes carry some weight as Zeus and Hades, but the only other name players here aside from Worthington are Gemma Arterton and Pete Postlethwaite.  The original \\"Clash\\" boasted, of course, Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Harry Hamlin, Ursula Andress, and numerous others.<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the skimpiness of the extras on this disc: just some alternate and additional scenes, but no director's commentary or, more damaging, no \\"making of\\" featurette showing how some of the eye-popping effects were created.<br /><br />Still, fans of Olympian spectacle will find plenty of eye-candy on display if little food for thought.  Worth a rental, at least -- maybe a purchase if a \\"tenth anniversary\\" DVD comes along with more extras.

B000AXWV40|5.0|It was not that George Clinton's Funkadelic was not revolutionary before Maggot Brain. The band spent two albums in 1970, [[ASIN:B000AXWV3G Funkadelic]] and [[ASIN:B000AXWV36 Free Your Mind...And Your Ass Will Follow]] proving that funk and soul could be as heavy and psychedelic as any rock. It was not like the Temptations taking ideas from Hendrix on , say, [[ASIN:B000001AD6 Cloud Nine]]. It was erasing ALL the lines between soul funk and rock. And black and white music.<br /><br />But Maggot Brain takes this to a new level. Eddie Hazel does an amazing wha wha solo on the title track: one of the best in popular music. But great solos are all over rock, and if you are just listening to Hazel, you are only getting half the point. The guitar on most funk records was a comping instrument--sometimes given a jangly little solo in the middle. \\"Maggot Brain\\" showed that the funky wha wha could create a funky solo. Funky as funk, loud as rock. Loud funk rock. Black and  white and funk and rock all over.<br /><br />And who cared. Not George Clinton: Was he too busy bringing funk to all kinds of music? Or all kinds of music to funk?<br /><br />The answer is Yes.<br /><br />Listen to \\"Can You Get To That.\\" The riff that starts it off is folk blues, but listen to how Clinton places a female vocal section straight off of Soul Train onto the rustic guitar.  The piece works as all the genres placed into a blender, coming out as a new type of music. Totally alien ideas, superimposed. Madness--on paper, but in reality, on vinyl, it is as natural as air.<br /><br />\\"Super Stupid\\" is more ironic acid crunch. \\"Armies Of Destruction\\" Hazel filling Hendrix's shoes. I need not outline the cross breed process again.<br /><br />But Maggot Brain was Clinton's vision now come completely true--music that could go anywhere, any place, any time. In 1971, when racial lines were being erased at a snails pace, Clinton sprayed you with too much acid wha wha party whoopie cushion funk rock cream for you to remember they ever even existed.

We've all been there in a dysfunctional place in our lives or in relationships that weren't working...Anyway LOVED this book and it would give me no greater joy if someone would option this and make it into a fantastic script and film.

0316098337|5.0|From the perspective of someone who reads many books of many different genres I must say that the premise for this book was one of the most creative and ingenious concepts I have read in a long time. Brilliantly written with such stark insight into a child's mind who was in the situation that child was that it gave me chills. It goes without saying I would read anything that this author wrote again without hesitation, but boy what she has to live up to.
0307454541|1.0|I hate this book.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  The only reason I am still reading it is so that I can found out what happens to the girl who disappeared.  I wish there was cliff notes so I could stop reading this book.  This is the worst book I have every read and I read about two books a week.  Not sure what all the hype is about and why it is a best seller.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|Alright......after initially listening to just a few songs and some demos and then getting my hands on the full CD, I will say that both positive and negative ratings are right in their own way.  Basically, this CD is just so dang different, that if you expect one thing, you won't get it and will be unhappy.  There aren't any especially great or catchy songs on there and it doesn't amp you up at all, which was what I was initially hoping for.  So that's why after my first taste I was like WTF Linkin Park?!?!  But then I got a hold of the full CD and I listened to it with headphones and just kind of chilled in my desk chair with the cool night breeze blowing through my windows.  As I listened, to me it seemed like someone was like, \\"Hey, Linkin Park, why don't you come up with a show version of your act to be like 'Stomp' or 'Blue Man Group' where people don't go crazy but just sit there in their seats like during an orchestral concert.\\" This CD would be the answer.  So yeah, it's a pretty funny idea and I laughed while I listened because it all just seems a little misplaced.  To me, it'd be like a 300-pound biker dude get on stage and sing Frank Sinatra, snapping his fingers and everything.  Once you get over the shock and just listen to the music, it sounds pretty good and is enjoyable.
B003S897U0|4.0|This album is great.  As others have said, a fan may have heard even better versions of these either in concert or on bootlegs but these versions are still great and worth owning.  I like the selection, too.  It includes songs from every album except By Your Side, and I was happy to see a few from Three Snakes and a Charm.    Looking to get more Crowes?  Here's a rundown of their albums from best to worst.    1) Amorica - Best album of the 90's.  Absolutely a classic. 10/10  2) Southern Harmony -Really more of a 1a.  Sometimes I think this one's their best, and also a classic. 9.99/10  3)  Three Snakes - Underrated.  Not on par with the two above this, but still great. 9/10  4)  Before the Frost...Until the Freeze - Their last studio album.  Not as straight ahead rocking, but so what when the songs are this good. 8.8/10  5) Shake Your Money Maker - The album that started it all.  Brilliant debut.  8.5/10  6)  Warpaint - A great \\"comeback\\" album.  Not as strong as earlier material, but still very good.  7.5/10  8)  Lions - Solid, but not great.  7/10  9) By Your Side - Their only album that misses the mark.  Poor songs, worse production, and a lazy attempt.  Note - no songs from Croweology are from this disc, so I think the Crowes themselves agree this is their weakest.  5/10
B004RE29PO|5.0|Preface<br /><br />While it appeared from the completely inadequate Amazon listing, and some other sources, that the 154-minute extended Version (the 1991 DVD Special Edition release containing 17 minutes of mostly great back-story and fill-in footage) was not included, it thankfully has been: there is a choice in the Blu-ray's opening menu as to which version to play.  So, Hollywood aliens are definitely in hibernation, and for a change, the new separate of &#34;Aliens&#34; contains both the 137-minute theatrical and extended versions of the complete movie, and some bonus materials, though the anthology is the package to get if bonus material is really important to you, and if you don't mind paying the premium for the last two, worthless installments, Alien III and IV, which are a stain on the franchise.<br /><br />Blu-ray technical review<br /><br />The 1991 Special Edition DVD plays very well on up-converting Blu-ray players, noticeably better than on regular DVD players, so well that I was really not all that anxious to pay for a Blu-ray upgrade to get what has been unanimously reported by anthology owners to be a somewhat better picture in HD.  But the reduced-price offer worked, and I got my Blu-ray.<br /><br />On the technical review, my HD/UC-DVD comparison, using an LG 42-inch, 1080p, HD TV and LG Blu-ray player, was on the extended, Special Edition version on Blu-ray, against the DVD Special Ed, as played through the same Blu-ray player, up-converting the DVD.  As to the HD quality of the Blu-ray, compared to up-converted DVD, the bad news is that there is a fine-sand grain, nearly through-out all but the brighter levels, most apparent in warmer tones and grays in medium- to low-light levels.  This grain might be the cause of the &#34;white snow&#34; reported in one review, which would be possible if the output settings of the TV are over-driven, as they usually are by non-critical users, and as they also usually are in the settings of those users' computer monitors.  There is no such snow effect on my disc/system.  But, even as this grain appears in my system, it is not really so apparent if you're not looking for it, as I was for the purpose of comparative evaluation.  This is the only drawback, and it is cancelled out by the pluses.<br /><br />First, and best of which, there is a very worthwhile improvement in sharpness resolution and color saturation over UC-DVD, first apparent in the special-effects scenes where star fields are much more distinct and more stars visible, and in shots where the salvage ship docks with Ripley's vehicle.  Enhanced color is first noticeable as the blowtorch cuts through the hatch, where it is noticeably more yellow.  The resolution improvement is most pronounced throughout the screen in the FX shots, but it is only because of reduced depth of field in close-ups that the nicely increased resolution of details &#34;appears to be&#34; more selectively improved in skin textures, iris details, and costume fabrics.  And, with black level, while it is the same in the Blu-ray as the DVD, there is nonetheless also a welcome improvement in dynamic range (the range of light to dark in which details are visible), though not as great as the improved sharpness and saturation, but a little goes a long way where dynamic range is concerned, as in more visible stars and details in Ripley's dark hair, as well as in those sometimes-deadly shadows.  And, with my 5.1 sound set-up, there is also a greater dynamic to the Blu-ray's DTS 5.1 sound (Dolby also available; the DVD has only Dolby 5.1).  So, all in all, the Blu-ray gets a technical 4-star rating and upgrade is very much worth it, particularly at the $14.95 price.<br /><br />Movie reviews<br /><br />As to the review of the movies, &#34;Alien,&#34; the brilliant first release, gets five stars, easy.  But look, by now, fans have seen it two or three times (me), fanatics more, and for a movie designed around a build-up to a scare, and to bring us the first sights of the monster, once the scares and the creature were out of the bag, there's no surprise or mystery or apprehension left, and only so much I can take to watch again... no more, unless force-viewing to show to a friend who never saw it, and I'm passing on the Blu-ray and keeping my DVD version of that because, until a few years from now, when I can get the &#34;Alien&#34; Blu-ray for $2 or $3, and might want to watch again, through the incentive of a better picture, I'd rather watch my DVD version of &#34;Alien&#34; for that rare-or-never occasion than spend again for the Blu-ray or a rental of &#34;Alien.&#34;  But if you've never seen these films, you're going to find they're both worth it and there's nothing better in the genre since, so DO rent or buy &#34;Alien&#34; before watching the sequel, &#34;Aliens.&#34;  You'll probably want to watch &#34;Alien&#34; again, sometime, but you should buy &#34;Aliens,&#34; because you'll definitely watch it more times through the years.<br /><br />&#34;Aliens&#34; is a seamless and story-enhancing sequel--five stars, not for its quality of production over the first, which is equal, but for its expanded scope, on all levels, especially with the added footage that was edited out of the theatrical release, which makes it the best of them all, and for me, it is where the &#34;Alien&#34; story ends.  They're both five-star movies, and they're both entirely different kinds of drama, one being an extension of the other.  &#34;Aliens&#34; isn't a scare-fest that depends almost entirely upon the unknown and a build wrapped in suspense, like &#34;Alien,&#34; the first movie.  It pivots around solid action with great characters, pretty well fleshed out, and it is also well-written with sharp dialogue, but it's the kind of flick with a logical and broadening extension of the story-line that you can watch again and again and again and...<br /><br />Now, some spoilers follow:<br /><br />&#34;Aliens&#34; opened up so many avenues for pushing the story and characters at its conclusion that it is hard to believe the producers dead-ended it with &#34;Alien III,&#34; which was too depressing and too monotone, dreary brown, to go with it--2½ stars, because even though I certainly don't care for what &#34;Alien III&#34; is, and particularly for the garbage can where it took the story, it was done well and was a believable circumstance, except for the meteor-like crash of the escape pod into the water, which was not survivable.  But no matter how well done, &#34;Alien III&#34; is nonetheless a cancer on the heart of the story that has, in my mind, along with &#34;Aliens IV,&#34; been excised, and had I known what III and IV were, I never would have watched them at all, letting the story in motion-picture form end with &#34;Aliens.&#34;  But, I didn't know and now I just have to think of III and IV as bad and terrible alternate endings and try to forget...<br /><br />It would have really been nice if they would have cut Ripley and the little girl, Newt, a break, making the crash on the prison world just a stop-over on the way to Earth, where Ripley and Newt survive fighting the alien (unfortunately, Cpl Dwayne Hicks still has to die in the escape-ship capsule for this to happen) along with beating back the horny and the pedo prisoners, where Ripley gets to fight-off and rescue Newt from another kind of monster, to finally get them both back to Earth and have a life, making guest-role appearances for Weaver after that in further releases, as a consultant/expert.  That's why I only wanted to get the extended &#34;Aliens&#34; on Blu-Ray, because in my mind, that's what happened, and all that followed in the franchise, after &#34;Aliens,&#34; never did.  I'd love it to have seen Ripley star in a after-she-got-her-life-back sequel to a re-written &#34;Alien III,&#34; but you know that there's no way she'd ever give up playing mom to Newt to go back into space to face aliens again.<br /><br />What ifs<br /><br />So, now, if they hadn't killed off Newt and Ripley, they could make a movie where the little girl, now grown into a tear-`em-apart bombshell, goes after the aliens in a critical situation on some other colony to avenge her family's death (in &#34;Aliens&#34;)--if they had kept her alive. And Ripley would star, to finally go with Newt after failing to talk her out of it, to help her and try to keep her safe.  This would be the place where Ripley should have died, at the climax of a fight where she is mortally wounded by an alien that was attacking Newt, which she kills before collapsing from her wound:<br /><br />Newt runs to Ripley, kneeling beside her and lifting her up into her arms, &#34;I'm so sorry I made you come here, Mother.&#34;  Newt touches the clothing torn open on Ripley's torso, and her face turns from frantic to despair as she scans the wounds... &#34;You're dying... and it's my fault.&#34;<br /><br />Ripley, bleeding and breathing heavily, gasps, struggling to speak, &#34;NO, you can't blame yourself, Darling.  You had to meet your own devils, just as I did when these monsters brought us together.&#34;<br /><br />Newt, tears rolling from her eyes, her arm warming with Ripley's flowing blood, &#34;Oh, Mom...&#34;<br /><br />Ripley strains to speak, but her voice is failing, softening, &#34;I never thought anything good would come from going back, but Newt, listen to me... remember, I'll never regret going back, NEVER... because it gave me you.&#34;  Ripley lifts a trembling arm to put her hand upon Newt's, grasping it, as if, through her, to hold on to life for just a few moments more, &#34;And now... you... you are fulfilling YOUR destiny.&#34;<br /><br />Newt quickly lifts her eyes from Ripley's face to scan the area.  They are alone in the darkening chamber, no aliens, alive, and no one to call to for help.  She hears Ripley groan and, turning back to her, Newt begins to sob, &#34;Oh...Mom...&#34;<br /><br />Struggling to hang on, Ripley pulls Newt closer and whispers, &#34;NEVER blame yourself.&#34; Ripley's brow angles with intent as she locks her eyes on Newt's, &#34;I am so proud of you. You have made me SO happy...&#34; Ripley's face relaxes into a blankness as her gaze begins to shift, looking somewhere above Newt now, as if blind, pale, fading away, &#34;And... and I will always... always love you...&#34;<br /><br />And so, as she dies, Newt's reply, &#34;I love you, so much...&#34; echos in a dream as she passes...<br /><br />just before the climax, as Newt, filled with anger and sorrow, goes on alone to avenge Ripley and her own family by wiping out the Alien origin hive and its overlord.<br /><br />Instead of that, we were given the meaningless, back-story death of Newt and the insanity that was sprung from the dead-end disaster of &#34;Alien III,&#34; when the franchise went into a realm of unbelievability, going way too far with &#34;Alien Resurrection,&#34; where some of the characters were way too comic-bookie, along with the situations, from the cloning, made necessary by the ridiculous decision to kill Ripley off in &#34;Alien III,&#34; to the space-running cadre, invoking a universe where space travel is more like Star Trek than the believable reality that was portrayed in the first two movies.  And the aliens are scary enough, as they can only be, with no need to make an ugly, comic, abortion version that really wasn't so scary at all in comparison, and which, in keeping with the for-kids-only flavor of the flick, is made to be a monster that cries like a baby... some weird, creative attempt at hinging humanity to the creature?  Well, the fact that the aliens were drooling around the universe was enough, and the attempt, in &#34;Alien IV,&#34; to evolve an abortion that would be more dreadful than Geiger's monster was a complete failure.  I gave that release a very generous two stars, and all of them for Weaver's portrayal in it which, as in the previous movies, was one where she made the best of a bad situation which, in this case, was not the making of the aliens in the realm of the story, but rather the external, creative decisions of the project's leaders.<br /><br />Retribution<br /><br />Actually, they could redeem themselves and reignite the franchise, making a new flick, &#34;Aliens--After the Dreams,&#34; where, on the way back to Earth, after blowing up the colony (after &#34;Aliens&#34;), they drifted through the core systems (as was the case after &#34;Alien&#34;), but this time, because something went wrong with a part of the hyper-sleep system, they began to age at some point, so that when their ship was finally intercepted, Ripley appears as she (Weaver) does today, and they select an appropriately-aged actress to play grown-up Newt, and Ripley tells her the strange dream she had while in the long sleep, about being on a prison world and Newt being dead, and Newt tells Ripley about a strange dream she had about this far-out military spaceship that was breeding alien abortions, and where Ripley was a clone!<br /><br />&#34;I've never had such absurd, insane dreams in all my life,&#34; Ripley would say, Newt, nodding in agreement.<br /><br />And the doctor would reply, &#34;We cannot account for all the effects of such extended sleep on the unconscious mind, especially in a case such as yours and Newt's, where your metabolism and subsequent aging process was accelerated more than it should have been.  But physiologically, I can tell you that if not for the reserve nutrition available to you because of the early, complete failure of Cpl. Hick's capsule, you both would have starved to death.&#34;<br /><br />Then, they could go get aliens again, in the new flick, in a new story that has some semblance of quality like the first two.<br /><br />But I’m glad they’ve come out with separates, and that the extended version of “Aliens” is in there.  I also prefer the “Aliens Director’s Cut,” and the added characterization it provides. “Aliens” is a jump-off point for imagination, where, post “Aliens,” in my mind, Ripley and Newt live on, chasing aliens and being chased by them... in my very best nightmares.<br /><br />UPDATE - October 2016<br /><br />I am updating my original review (above) which was posted in 2010, because I have just learned that a sequel to Alien/Aliens will be made, and the good news, that it will overlook Alien III and IV, and will include grown-up Newt and a reappearance for Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.  I am also pleased to see on various Youtube blogs that Aliens III and IV are being “written off,” not only by the producers of the promised “Aliens 5?” sequel, but also by most fans as alternate timelines, alternate universes or, as I suggested, bad dreams that never really happened.<br /><br />Prometheius has also become part of the accepted Alien franchise since I published this “Aliens” review, and it is a worthwhile entry which, though leaving open questions, has a sequel in the works which is said will answer some of them while also tying-in more completely to the “Alien” universe—an anticipated release, but I really can’t wait for the “Aliens” sequel, which promises to right the ship from the sinking caused by III and IV, and open the franchise to a new future of stories as I have envisioned, with Newt as the alien kick-ass beauty to succeed Ripley in the fight against the undying alien threat.ear-`em-apart bombshell, goes after the aliens in a critical situation on some other colony to avenge her family's death (in &#34;Aliens&#34;)--if they had kept her alive.

0452289963|1.0|I was given a copy of this book over a year ago as a gift by someone who was trying to be helpful and supportive.  I hated the attitude this writer had about spirituality in general and felt he was talking down to the reader.  I could only get through a few chapters before feeling physically ill by the author's spiritual arrogance.  The ideas were not challenging to me at all and I felt no connection with the person behind the words.  Save your money and see a good therapist before wasting your vaulable time on the planet reading this gibberish.  Only you can know and create what your purpose is, and nobody else can tell you what that can be, not even this charlatan.  I find it hard to understand how so many can be taken in by the words of a single human being.  There are plenty of others who have written better: Ghandi, Mother Teresa, Goethe, Sartre, Wittgenstein, etc.  Read the greats, and you'll know of what I speak.

Just take a year off to travel like this author, or take 6 months off of life to walk the Appalachian Trail, or if you are like most of us - a Sunday drive through the mountains.<br /><br />I searched for this after finding out that Julia Roberts was going to be in a movie based on the book, so of course my first thought was - I must read the book before seeing the movie!<br /><br />I was surprised to find it in the nonfiction section of the library, surprised that it was a true story, more surprised that it was true after reading it, Wow! do people really just run off to find themselves, taking a whole year, having the experiences and adventures Elizabeth had? It would be a great fiction story, something made up and added to and embellished as it was written, but no, it is all real!<br /><br />Elizabeth found herself at a place in her life where she supposedly had everything she ever wanted or needed, a husband, nice house, job, at that time in her life when she was supposed to want to have kids, but instead she finds herself every night on the bathroom floor crying - hence the white shiny tile on the book jacket. She felt lost, beautifully described in her words:<br /><br />\\"When you're lost in those woods, it sometimes takes you a while to realize that you are lost. For the longest time, you can convince yourself that you've just wandered off the path, that you'll find your way back to the trailhead any moment now. Then night falls again and again, and you still have no idea where you are, and its time to admit that you have bewildered yourself so far off the path that you don't even know from which direction the sun rises anymore.\\"<br /><br />Like many woman, all of her adult life she had been 1/2 of a couple, 1/2 a person, just an appendage of her partner, not standing alone, only able to function when her other half was supporting her... then it all fell apart and without this other half she learned that she could be independent and stand alone and make decisions on her own, she became stronger. Without the trappings of couplehood she searched within and rediscovered the things she liked to do and eat and see.<br /><br />The book is divided into 3 sections, one for each place she traveled to - Italy (eat), India (pray), and Indonesia (love). I must admit I enjoyed the first and last sections more than the middle, it did seem to get bogged down in all the meditating, but I also realize the importance of this part and the fact that she had get through it completely before moving on.<br /><br />I love to compare books to the movies made from them, usually the book is far better, but it is good to put real faces to characters in the book.t this other half she learned that she could be independent and stand alone and make decisions on her own, she became stronger.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was excited to receive the Wicked CD so quickly. Unfortunately, the CD was faulty and wouldn't record on iTunes or play in my conventional CD player or car player. I sent a note to the seller who immediately responded with an apology and a refund to my account. Thank you very much.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|The DVD looked great (looks better upscaled in my Onkyo Blu Ray), but the Blu Ray is much better. Overall resolution isn't much different, but skin tones are more natural and there's more fine detail (especially in the shadows). The surround sound has gotten even more clear and realistic; you almost feel like your in the Matrix.<br /><br />If you have a good DVD player and TV as well as a good stereo system, you probably won't notice anything bad enough to make you want to upgrade. But if you have the equipment that can bring out the best of HD, you won't regret moving up.
B002H3T3TM|5.0|Spontaneity. That 's definitely what impresses me the most about him. His spontaneity. It seems he is at his home, together with his buddies. This is great. Knowing this artist's facet just puts him-her closer to his-her audience. I do not understand what stuck-up people get for being boring, stuck-up and for sure it ain't Buble's case. If his voice is wonderful, you would like to buy his albums and, now, being nice as he is, will make me wanting to buy his DVDs as well. Congrats, Michael Buble. Wonderful DVD! I will definitely show my buddies when they come my house to drink beer, wine or whatever. It will be like a bedside book, always around, ready to be read (in this case, a \\"TV-side\\", always ready to be played - HEHE).
B0036EH3WK|5.0|My biggest worry was that I wouldn't get the bonus discs from the first five seasons (I wasn't even turned on to LOST until about a year ago). Those are there, a bonus disc for the sixth season is there, and there's even a SECRET disc!! The blacklight, Black Rock letter, black and white rock game, and the beautifully designed packaging are all just some super tasty icing.
1933492953|5.0|Book is mostly about composition in story boards for movies. Last section deals about comics but is fairly short. The majority of the story board information can apply to comics too.    Content is very good. It deals with setting up composition in an abstract way before adding detail. Information is shown in a easy to understand way. Abstract versions of different shots are shown next to more detailed drawings. Text is easy to understand.     Its the only book on have that connects storytelling and composition. I have some books about fine art composition that deal with some of the same things but most of the information in the books is new to me. It also answered questions I had about applying perspective in ways that fit the composition.    I'd recommend the book.
0891419063|5.0|\\"Old Breed\\" is perhaps one of the best on-the-ground accounts about World War II combat I've ever read. Having been in the Marine Corps, gone through the training (which was far less intense) and combat in Vietnam, I KNOW I would have not survived with the Marines in the Pacific.<br /><br />To the remaining World War II veterans, I thank you for your service.

FYI it is huge so make sure you have a full town... or a pretty decent mid tower. Installation was over all easy. Hated putting on bracket after u put cooler on, put once its secure, it stays in place reeeeeal nice like. Feel secure! Just ordered 2 Cooler Master 120mm RED LED fans to replace the black ones I have on it. It will looks pretty sweet in my black/red themed HAF 932 case. ^_^

B000HIVIOW|5.0|My 2 yr old son and I watch this movie at least three times a week. I usually put it on either when he needs some quiet time or just before a nap.<br />The fact that there are no words just action and music make this movie so unique.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This double CD has all the classic songs, including Landslide, Over My Head & the full lenghth Sara all on 1 disc. I wanted those 3 songs and was not able to find them all on 1 CD until I found this set on Amazon and a previuos reviewer said that the full length Sara was on this set so I bought it and have been very satisfied!
B002K0WBYG|5.0|I'm happy that I missed this movie when it was showing in theaters because now I own a copy. Although Sandra Bullock has proven that she excells in many genres of acting(hooray for the awards from The Blindside) she continues to be my favorite actress for romantic comedies. I still have visions of her outdoor scene in Alaska with the puppy, her cell phone & the eagle. You've got to see this one.
0792835050|5.0|I was seeking a replacement for a classic video that I had somehow lost.  The video I received was precisely what I expected.  And that, in itself, is the review.

B003L0VJF6|5.0|I was looking for a modern recording of the Brahms Violin Concerto recently, the Penguin Guide gave Fischer's top marks, so I picked it up, and only then did I discover this amazing talent who combines technical perfection with mature musical expression to truly great effect.  I've since enjoyed immensely her other recordings -- particularly her Tchaikovsky, which is easily the best I've heard.  So, then I was hunting around YouTube the other day to *see* her play and came across, surprise, a clip of her playing the Grieg.  On the piano.  What the..?!  Is this girl from Mars or what?  I had to get the DVD.    It's an absolute delight.  The Saint-Saens is, naturally, gorgeous, perfect, a pleasure.  The Grieg is very fine too.  It is technically accomplished and musically expressive, although, at times during the Adagio, I found her touch just a touch too harsh, and, yeah, she doesn't play the piano with the same dazzling highest-level virtuosity that she plays the violin, but she's awfully good.  (Also, I wouldn't have minded a better balance between soloist and orchestra -- the piano overwhelms the orchestra in the recording.)    The uncommonly excellent -- and long -- special feature really makes the whole thing.  Let's not kid ourselves:  Fischer is a beautiful player, but she's also beautiful, which, of course, is catnip for marketers, and, you know, doesn't hurt.  In the interviews, she emerges as a beautiful person too.  It really warms your heart to hear a young, grounded person -- no sicko child wonder -- talk the way she does about classical music.  She's really an inspiration.
0374158460|5.0|Although I was blown away by the Corrections almost 10 years ago, I found I liked this one even more.  This was a much more upbeat, positive novel than The Corrections, proving Franzen's increasing depth as an author.  In a local interview, he expressed more satisfaction of this novel, indicating that parts of the former were written when he was at a different place in his life, rendering sections that baffled him into wondering \\"Who wrote this, anyway?\\"  Franzen also pointed out that the characters are fictional constructs that only exist on paper, but his dialogue and spot on characterizations bring them truly to life, bringing tears to my eyes when I reached the final page.  The interviewer (a personal friend, former collegue) addressed the issue of the title, asking Franzen just what did he mean by the title, Freedom?  Franzen, taking a bit of a time to answer, responded that he wished he'd named it something else since it seems to be causing more than its share of speculation.  If it hadn't been taken already by two entities this year, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" would have been worthy.   Some novels running a 1/3 as long as this one can feel as if they're 3 times its length.  This novel, despite its almost 600 pages, was fun, illustrative, rich and involving.
0553381687|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about GRRM and the series? I'll refer back to a review someone else posted about how great the book was even for people who do not enjoy fantasy as their primary genre. Fantasy is -not- my first choice genre, but I read GRRM on the suggestion of a friend, and I was not at all disappointed. His stories are rich and layered, and the characters (despite that there are a lot, as some have mentioned) are well developed and complex. He isn't afraid to push the envelope, and he doesn't sugar coat the raw and gritty, and yet it never seems contrived or gratuitous. It takes someone with a practiced hand at their craft to manage to straddle that line in my opinion, and he does it very well. I highly suggest this series to anyone and everyone.
0393072231|5.0|i followed the story in the wall street journal as it happened, this book filled in what was hidden to most of us. i find it very interesting how money is really based on faith. money, stocks and bonds is such a game and things that happen with them really dont effect people directly. if we all go about our business without knowing anything it all seems to work ok. it is amasing how there is a great disconnect between the average wage earner and the invester who wins or looses great sums of money. if we as a simple worker have the things we need it doesnt matter what happens in the financil world. thanks for the insight, very intesting book well written easy to understand and follow for somene like me who isnt involved in the finanial world. i think that everyone would learn something from this book and ones like it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is done very well. It is informative with good research and honest views.    Everyone living in America and Canada should watch this video. We need to know where our food really comes from, who is in control, how it is produced and the process of getting it from its raw form to our tables in to our mouths.    We, as the people, need to be informed so we can make choices that will affect our food industry for the better.    Only the people - the consumers - can make it happen if we learn and stand up for a cause we believe in.    Thanks to the hard work of the people who produced this film and for taking risks to help those of us who can't \\"get in\\" to see how food is produced and to help us better understand the politics and bureaucracy behind it all.    It has changed my life!

0340896965|5.0|Any book that makes me forget I'm sitting in a middle seat of an airplane for four hours is a gem. My only complaint? My trip was 10 hours. If only One Day by David Nicholls lasted the whole way!    One Day made me laugh out loud often. Curious, my son tried reading it over my shoulder to see what was so amusing.     The characters, for one, are real - you know people like this. There's Dexter, the golden boy from a rich, upper class family. He's got looks, money, girls. Fortune has favored him since birth and probably will continue to do so for the rest of his days.     He befriends Emma, his opposite in every way. She is an awkward, insecure young woman who has to work hard for everything, enduring humiliating (but humorous) travails.     One Day follows both their lives, often interconnecting, usually heading in opposite directions, through their 20s and 30s. The narrative alternates between Emma's and Dexter's perspectives, skipping a year at a time. Nicholls nails the characters' subtly changing points of view as they grow older, as well as the British cultural references from the 80s to the present.     I love the ambitious framework of One Day. I started thinking of what I would learn about myself if I just revisited just one day of every year for the past 20 years of my life. The hairstyles alone make me cringe.     It would be easy to make fun of these obviously flawed people - Emma, as the poor intellectual, can be judgmental while Dexter, who's had nothing but a ridiculously lucky life, can be a shallow buffoon. But Nicholls gives them and every other character humanity and dimension. The rich parents, the snooty girlfriend, the clown boyfriend - could all have easily been superficial stock figures used to move the story along, but they weren't; instead, they emerge with stories of their own. As funny as this book was, Nicholls made me care about not only about Emma and Dexter, but those in their lives.     The dialogue is what makes One Day a fabulous read. In the following excerpt, Dexter has just been made a new presenter for a British t.v. show called \\"largin' it.\\" (Yes, it's supposed to be in lower case.)    \\"Anxious not to appear affected or cocky or a fake, he had been devising an expression that said, hey, it's no big deal, it's only TV and he assumed this expression now, replacing his sunglasses and returning to his book.    \\"Emma watched this performance, amused; the straining for nonchalance, the slight flare of the nostrils, the smile that flickered at the corners of his mouth.    \\"'It's not gonna change you, is it?'    \\"'What?'    \\"'Being very, very slightly famous.'    \\"'I hate that word. Famous.'    \\"'Oh and what would you prefer? Well known?'    \\"'How about notorious?' He grinned.    \\"'Or annoying? How about annoying? ... And can you drop that now please?'    \\"'What?'    \\"'The cockney accent. You went to Winchester College, for Christ's sake.'    \\"'I don't do a cockney accent.'    \\"'When you're Mr. TV you do. You sound like you've left whelk stall to go and do this 'ere fancy telly programme.'    \\"'You've got as Yorkshire accent!'    \\"'Because I'm from Yorkshire!'    Dexter shrugged. 'I've got to talk like that, otherwise it alienates the audience.'    'And what if it alienates me?'    ...    \\"'Well do you?'    \\"'What?'    \\"'Watch me? On largin' it?'    \\"'I might have had it on. In the background once or twice while I'm balancing my chequebook...It's not my thing, Dex.'    \\"'Tell me anyway...Just say what you think.'    'Okay, well I think the programme is like being screamed at for an hour by a drunk with a strobe-light but like I said...'    \\"'And what about me?'    \\"'What about you?'    \\"'Well-am I any good? As a presenter?'    \\"'Dexter, you are possible the greatest presenter of Youth TV that this country has ever known and I don't say that kind of thing lightly.'    \\"Proudly, he raised himself onto one elbow. 'Actually, I prefer to think of myself as a journalist.'    \\"Emma smiled and turned a page. 'I'm sure you do.'\\"    I believe One Day is going to be made into a movie. I'm thinking Jude Law for Dexter, the beautiful playboy. As for Emma, she's dark-haired, but I'm thinking Kate Winslet or even Rachel Weisz. Whoever plays Dexter and Emma, I will definitely be in line to see the film adaptation of this unique and hugely entertaining love story.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I LOVED this movie and so has everyone I know that watched it. Very entertaining. So many good looking people who can actually ACT in one very funny, action driven movie with cool effects. Only problem with it, which in our house is a HUGE problem, on PPV version there was no Closed Captioning. My husband has severe hearing loss and could not watch the movie do to lack of captioning. I am interested in knowing if they put captioning on dvd version. Ticks me off I already paid for it once and might have to buy dvd to let hubby enjoy.
0812973992|5.0|I love love love this book.  I enjoyed every word.  Don't read it without a highlighter.  This story is smart, gripping, and really touches the soul.  I enjoyed the different storylines and characters.  I fell in love with each one of them.

0061205699|5.0|I'm not going to type out a long drawn-out review. If you have half a brain, you'll enjoy this book immensely. It really bothers me that there are people out there that really think this book is about racism. Does it deal with racism? yes, but it's not that the author is racist and is lashing out. She was simply telling a story. It's sad to say that what happened in the book as far as race goes, happened all over The South at that time. This is just one story through the eyes of a 9 year old girl. I highly recommend this book.

B00000DFSK|4.0|When looking at a greatest hits collection it is important to look at them in a certain context.  As a big U2 fan who owns every album (and a handful of singles), I know that overall I am not the target audience so much as either     A.A newcomer interested in getting a feel for the band to see if they'd like to buy more  B.A casual fan who'd like a nice blend of the band's biggest songs to toss in the car    The tracklisting is a solid collection which serves to both represent U2's most popular cuts for anyone interested in hearing the most radio-played period of the band.      This is definately skewed towards the band's more succesful stadium-rocking mid-late 80's form, with 9 of the 14 cuts representing the that style of the band-- I omit the title track to unforgettable fire because the album was a transition between forms and while Bad and Pride feel very much in place with Joshua Tree and Rattle & Hum cuts, the title track feels like its own beast entirely.    War (1983) then slips down to two tracks while the Band's first two albums (Boy and October) are represented by a single track (I Will Follow) coupled with a hidden cut of October's title song.    The Sweetest thing, a former B-side redone for the now prerequisite 'new song' is a nice little pop addition.    Overall what is the bottom line?  4/5 stars.  The lost star comes not because of the music itself, which is all fantastic vintage U2, but for the limited historical overview.  Trading out a track or two from the second half of their career in favor of an older (and perhaps less popular) cut-- cutting the lengthy All I Want is You would clear roughly the same amount of time as it would take to put a song like Gloria or Fire in to represent October and still have time left to close the disc with War's 40 (maintaining the ongoing theme of a soothing, softer close to each U2 album).

1439181780|5.0|The one star and five star reviews differ with people's attitude toward what this book calls them to do.  It doesn't say sit and salivate and drool with love like a puppy. It tells you to take the attitude of love, meaning positivity in outlook and focus. So if you are the type of person that is mired in negative stuff and you cherish your state, then you will keep saying \\"buh-humbug\\" all the way. But if you have had enough of your pity-parties and you want to clear the junk in the attic of your head, then you will decide to APPLY the book's suggestions and God forbid, you may actually get out of your misery corner. So if you have no such intention, then don't waste your money.  Not too many of the reviewers seem to have actually tried any of the concepts in the book. So they are not at all talking from experiential evaluation of the book.  IF you want to try and APPLY the ideas, the book will be an uplifting start.  Take the ideas and build on them, practice thinking only what you love and want, and if you still do not get any results, then come back to review with complaint that it was painful reading. If you honestly put it into practice, you will not need to! If it will sit on the shelf with all your other half-baked, half completed projects of yours, then save time and money now. So my  suggestion:    You want to really APPLY and practice the book's way of living = BUY!!!!  You do NOT want to APPLY and practice = Don't buy.     You decide. Simple: In the end what you get is what you want and love.

B002ZG97RE|3.0|Like the title suggests I thought the movie (storyline/acting/etc.) was excellent. However the video quality in parts makes we want to complain to the people in charge of mastering the video. About half of the video looks good, as anyone would expect. While other parts and not necessarily the dark sport look just aweful. By that I mean very fuzzy. It's not the whole screen either. At times it seems to be centralized on an actors face.    This movie does an excellent job in portraying what actually happened, when our troops entered Iraq in search of those elusive WMD's (that were never found!) Another point in this movie that is dead on, is how much different agencies in the U.S. do not cooperate with one another. There have been several interviews with people is these agencies that confirmed this claim. They still to this day argue about various intel.    Overall this is a great movie that portrays truth in wartime scenarios. But don't waste your money on the Blu-ray version just yet. The video quality just isn't there to justify the extra expense.

B00005JMCN|5.0|There's THE STORY OF SEABISCUIT and then there's SEABISCUIT, and sorry to Shirley Temple but her version turns out the lesser film. If you've read Laura Hillenbrand's best-seller book but haven't seen the movie, go see the movie - and, vice versy, if you've seen the movie but haven't read the book, read the book. Either way, the Biscuit's story is ridiculously entertaining. That it's also a true-to-life account makes it that much more compelling. Who would've thunk it that one of my favorite athletes of all time would turn out to be a horse?<br /><br />There was a time when Seabiscuit was America's most celebrated personality, getting even more pub than F.D.R. Seabiscuit lived and raced during the Great Depression, the course of his storied life running parallel with the ups and downs of that era. He was the son of Hard Tack, grandson of Man-O-War, and growing up he was abused and so became bitter and incorrigible.  Standing barely 15 hands, the Biscuit was certainly never tapped to be a champion racehorse. His mean upbringing is mentioned, except that the film's first 44 minutes devote themselves to a leisurely introduction of the three damaged men who would shape the Biscuit's career, shape him into a legend. One after another, we meet the visionary entrepreneur (who is a bit of a huckster), the peculiar horse whisperer quietly mourning a vanishing way of life, and the half-blind, overeducated jockey who boxed and quoted Shakespeare.<br /><br />The casting choices are spot-on. There's no bad egg in this bunch, from the principal actors - and how many crazy pounds did Tobey Maguire lose for the part? - down to ancillary characters like George \\"the Iceman\\" Woolf as played by real life jockey Gary Stevens (in his debut role) and the fun, fast-talking radio announcer Tick Tock McGlaughlin, marvelously brought to life by William H. Macy.<br /><br />The races are rousing, pulse-pounding stuff, yeah. The story builds up to the historic match race with War Admiral and later the Santa Anita Hundred Grander, and I couldn't believe how intense my sense of anticipation was leading into these races. And when you bring up that list of best sports cinema, SEABISCUIT is up there with ROCKY and HOOSIERS, because how do you not root for this gutsy ugly little horse? Narrated with quiet assurance by David McCullough, this is something lyrical, a period film that looks authentic and packs an emotional punch. It's also a dynamite history lesson concerning a time when the country was tested severely, and phrases like \\"pick themselves up by their bootstraps\\" and \\"never say die attitude\\" circulated like a mother, became rallying cries. Beaten down but never bowed was the Biscuit, and he never quit. You can see why he became the common guy's hero. See this movie. Read the book.<br /><br />The DVD's special features include: audio commentary by director Gary Ross and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh (in which the two pause the movie several times to go even more in depth about certain scenes); \\"Bringing the Legend to Life\\": the Making of SEABISCUIT (00:15:04 minutes); \\"Anatomy of a Movie Moment\\" - Gary Ross shares his step-by-step filmmaking process of one sequence from script to screen; \\"Seabiscuit: Racing thru History\\" explores more of Seabiscuit's stunning rise to celebrity status thru historic newsreel footage of actual races (including clips of his match race with War Admiral) and numerous interviews, including interviews with Gary Ross and author Laura Hillenbrand (00:14:53); \\"Photo Finish\\" - Jeff Bridges' On the Set photographs; \\"The Longshot\\" - a special message from Buick, set in a faux newsreel format and which goes into the origins of the Buick auto and also of Charles Howard's involvement (00:03:19); promotional material; cast & filmmakers bios and film highlights; production notes; and DVD-ROM features.er the Santa Anita Hundred Grander, and I couldn't believe how intense my sense of anticipation was leading into these races.

Read the book.<br /><br />The DVD's special features include: audio commentary by director Gary Ross and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh (in which the two pause the movie several times to go even more in depth about certain scenes); \\"Bringing the Legend to Life\\": the Making of SEABISCUIT (00:15:04 minutes); \\"Anatomy of a Movie Moment\\" - Gary Ross shares his step-by-step filmmaking process of one sequence from script to screen; \\"Seabiscuit: Racing thru History\\" explores more of Seabiscuit's stunning rise to celebrity status thru historic newsreel footage of actual races (including clips of his match race with War Admiral) and numerous interviews, including interviews with Gary Ross and author Laura Hillenbrand (00:14:53); \\"Photo Finish\\" - Jeff Bridges' On the Set photographs; \\"The Longshot\\" - a special message from Buick, set in a faux newsreel format and which goes into the origins of the Buick auto and also of Charles Howard's involvement (00:03:19); promotional material; cast & filmmakers bios and film highlights; production notes; and DVD-ROM features.
B003O85W3A|5.0|There's not much to say except this is my favorite Arcade Fire record and one of the best I've heard in a long time. I've been listening for the last few weeks and I'm still not sick of it. Favorites include The Suburbs, Ready to Start, Modern Man, Rococo, Empty Room, Suburban War, Deep Blue, Month of May. Actually, almost every track is good. I also found that the CD of songs was better than the iTunes downloads, both in the meaning of the sequence and quality of the tracks. It's worth buying it. Just do it!
0765326353|5.0|This book is definitely Sanderson's best work to date. His dialogue has come a long way from Elantris and the world building in this novel is incredible, rivaling that done by any fantasy author since Tolkien. The fight scenes were tight and vivid, exciting and easy to visualize. All in all a great read and excellent start to an epic series.
0470876417|5.0|The phrase \\"Business model\\" is one of the most overused yet undefined in business. For decades companies, startups and business schools have used it to justify almost everything but it has meant almost nothing.    Until now.    Osterwalder has written the definitive text for how to define, think, draw and iterate business models.  And with it has given companies and precise tool to visualize what had been an imprecise concept.    His thesis is that every business can be broken down into nine core elements.  The definition and relationship of each of these elements are how a company delivers value to a customer and ultimately makes money.    While his intent was a text for existing businesses I use the book to teach Customer Development and Lean Startups. The Business Model Canvas is the ultimate scorekeeping tool for startups searching for a business model.    Buy a copy for everyone in your company.
B000002KYR|2.0|I saw this guy interviewed on Letterman last night, and let me just tell you ... WEIRD!!!!! He's a former country artist and actor who now thinks he can play guitar and jam in a rock band. I've got one thing to say to that -- NOT!!!!!    Cryptic one-word answers and dark sunglasses will only get you so far in this non-MTV generation. After all, it ain't the 1980s anymore. To be a real artist you need substance, which this dude is lacking.     On the positive side, his first movie was pretty neat!!    For real country music, visit the Henry the Hermit website at [...].     See ya soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) I was interested in this movie because of M Night, despite his spotty record over the past few films, and the fact that he only produced Devil and didn't direct.  This is the first of several \\"Night Chronicles.\\"  It turns out to be generally good, although not quite what I was expecting.  As can be gleaned from the trailer, it's about 5 people trapped in a skyscraper elevator (the inside kind).  One of them may be a killer, or even something evil.  Although the trailer didn't reveal too much, I expected the story to involve the early revelation of a demonic figure, and a lot more gore than there was.  Instead, it's much more about the suspense of not knowing who the killer is and what will happen next.  This film is pretty subtle, at times almost too subtle.  By that I mean the scariness factor might have been upped by just a few more flashes of the demonic as events unfolded.  There were also a couple of disconnects or logical fallacies here and there, such as how the characters didn't figure out a source of light until much later than they should have (during the lights-out moments in the elevator), and the guy falling out of the skyscraper at the beginning was never really explained.  Those things were minor though, as I was propelled along by the tense story, and the acting was also solid.  Chris Messina as the detective and Matt Craven as the security chief were especially good.

1440503257|5.0|We're a homeschooling family and this book has been an incredible addition to our study of the European continent & cultures as well as a tie-in to the Harry Potter books. History. literature, and home economics all rolled into one package. But wait, there's more to love! The author has a delightful sense of humour as well as wonderful way of presenting the recipes in an easy-to-follow manner.    In just 2 days my 12 yr. old son and I have made 9 of the recipes with a great many more to follow. We're having a blast!    This book is a must, not just for homeschoolers, but for any Harry Potter fan or those who love food and are curious to know exactly what Toad in the Hole and Bangers & Mash really are.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred!  It is a great workout for those of us who don't have the time/money to go to the local gym.  I am on day 15 and can see a difference in my fitness level and my body's appearance.  I definitely recommend this to those who will stick with the 30 day program.  You won't regret it!
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Some bands improve with age. This is the case with Devo. The message of the CD's images is that the message of de-evolution is for everyone. From the opening cords of Fresh to the end of March On, this CD is classic Devo at its best. Each track in its own metaphorical way tempts the listener to turn away from de-evolved ideas and into a new mode of thinking. Add to this a complimentary sound of synthasizers and guitars, and you have an instant classic.
030726999X|5.0|The third book in the series is just as enjoyable as the first two, and the reader finally gets answers that connect all the dots in the lives of Mikael and Lizbeth. It's a fascinating look into a modern-day Sweden. My only question is... do Swedes really drink that much coffee?
0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I read it at least twice a year and I can never put it down.  Phenomenal writing!
B00394DOE8|5.0|I'm a military wife. Of someone who HAS fought over there. I read this book on a whim, sounded mildly interesting. Gave me a perspective that most who don't even have my life experiences have. Knowing the lifestyle and tribulations of those living on the other side, gave me a perspective that I would have never had. SO glad I read this book, feels like a lesson on HUMANITY not just a story and a little history. One of my favorite books, and I'm more of a romance kinda girl (Gone With the Wind being #1 hands down) but this book I feel like changed my life. I now see people with hopes, faith, love of country just as I do, not just the enemy. I also feel like reading the Kite Runner (also by he same author) completes that picture for me. Read both if you want to UNDERSTAND the taliban, champion women's rights, for whatever reason, but you will never regret it. Now I feel like that not only do I understand what we are fighting for, but WHY. So proud to be an American, but I GET why others do it. That they believe in their cause just as much as I do. As my husband does luckily too. Coming from who I believe is the most patriotic person I know.. Myself. I believe in duty, honor, and most of all, country. But so do they.
0439023513|4.0|I couldn't put this down.. literally (6 hour airplane ride)! But, overall it was good. Not as well developed as some of the earlier stories. Seemed kindof hurried and messy at some points in the story. I've read some reviews about the book being anti-war, which is total lunacy. I didn't like the very end, how everything went down. I won't ruin it for those who didn't read it, but it could have happened differently or in much better developed/better written way than it did. I give it 4 stars for holding my attention the entire time- which is difficult to do. -1 star for the lame ending and some predictability throughout (the ending not included in this, but maybe in an attempt to overcompensate for the earlier parts of the book the author went way overboard with the crazy ending).
0811876373|5.0|I love this book, great pictures, great ideas, there is nothing I don't like about it. I would highly recommend this book.
0439023483|5.0|This book was creative and well written.  The story isn't at all a sound-a-like to anything else I've ever read. You relate to Katniss, but are also intrigued by the idea of existing in a world like the one she does in this story. This pulls at your heart strings, especially once they start \\"the hunger games\\". You also can see human flaws in their ugliest form in this book. Very interesting perspectives on things.

B000KX0IOA|4.0|In 1893, Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Though I appreciate the recent reviews of how good the remastered version of Gladiator is - the question for me is - which version is amazon.com shipping now?

Anyone know what is being shipped by amazon.com??
1567184855|5.0|Rather than repeating the same praises about this book that many have already left, I just want to say that this book does corroborate the loose ends discussed in my other researches.    This is one of the most important books you will find on the subject of the purpose of life.  Although I will say that some of the details fail to corroborate if we limit our understanding of the mechanisms of reincarnation to the solar system only.    There is a video interview of Dr. Newton on youtube that nicely introduces those who are new to this concept.    -----    Corroborates with:    The Pleiadian Mission   - Spirit forms as energy from the forces of creation   - Reincarnation as a reality
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a movie I got from Netflix, but I am buying it to share with friends and so I can watch it again whenever I like. Be sure to view it a second time with Temple's commentary--it is just as interesting as the film itself and validates everything in it. She had a hand in the production, and her comments about Claire Danes' performance are worth the price.
0060723513|5.0|I bought this book for my 8th grade daughter as required reading for her English class. She was so touched by it that I read it, too. It is a wonderful story about the power of the human spirit and mind.  It shows how far from the source of the Universe (whatever you choose to call it) our civilization has become.  It was written in the early 90's - the doctor's journey happened in the late 80's.  It now seems even more timely and urgent that the message of the Aborigine tribe is shared with as many people on the planet as possible. Many profound life and spiritual lessons for my daughter and everyone. I highly recommend this book!

0451529308|5.0|My first actual introduction to Little Women came from watching the Winona Ryder version of the film on a snowy, beautiful day in New England during my sophmore year of high school. I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.<br /><br />Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.<br /><br />On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)<br /><br />So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come.can be done about it at this point.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|After three seasons of compelling and surprising stories, and just when you think they couldn't possibly come up with anything as exciting as what's come before, the creative team behind \\"Dexter\\" outdoes itself by carefully crafting an unendingly surprising and multi-dimensional story arc that has no extraneous moments -- EVERY piece of it fits carefully into the whole.  They keep leading you in one direction only to whip you around to an entirely different and exciting path and the circumstances keep shifting on many fronts.  During broadcast, I kept thinking to myself, \\"I have to wait another WEEK to find out what happens next?!\\"  And on top of all the carefully plotted and supremely acted story lines, they manage to ask and explore really deep questions about identity and fate and human nature.  Absolutely brilliant, and while I'm delighted that John Lithgow was recognized for his fearlessly fantastic performance as Arthur Mitchell, and I appreciate both Bryan Cranston and Mad Men, I gotta say that I felt that the Emmys should have gone to Michael C. Hall and Dexter.  Anxiously awaiting Season Five.
B002PHVAQY|5.0|This is a great accessory for someone who, like me is a night owl.  I seem to play my guitar alot after 11PM and this way, I can do so without bothering anyone else in the house.  It has a very nice sound for something that you use with headphones and allows you to plug into your PC or MP3 player and play along with whatever music you want play along with.  I have found that it is quite battery friendly.  I am still using the original batteries that came with it and have used it for at least an hour a day since I got it over a month ago.

0553805371|3.0|Hawking's first published book in nearly 10 years, The Grand Design sets out to solve the question \\"Is there a unified theory?\\" If you've thought about this and think not, then you are right. The quick answer is No. However, many scientists have been pondering this for quite some time. Einstein did not find what he was looking for and, for now at least, Hawking and his colleague Mlodinow have concluded that a so-called unified theory of everything does not exist.<br /><br />In their recent publication they open with a lovely reference to Douglas Adams' number 42, continue with a brief history of science, putter about defining laws, philosophize about realism and then talk about what makes a good theory. Its not for a ways in that you get to some good stuff; the meat and potatoes of what The Grand Design is all about is something referred to as 'M-theory'. Unfortunately, M-theory isn't anything new, rather a new-ish term for uniting the current physical theories. The proper new material in The Grand Design can be summarized as follows: M-Theory dictates that the universe is composed of 11 total dimensions. Full stop.<br /><br />Compared to Hawking's other books, the amount of description and background material in this book is little, rather its focus is on a very clear description of where physicists are with current knowledge and technology, leaving the details and especially the mathematics behind. Hawking does a great job explaining some fascinating experiments and their implications including the double-slit experiment involving buckyballs and John Conway's game of life.<br /><br />Overall, The Grand Design is simple to read, well illustrated, and without mathematical formulas. Its kept short both in length and detail to keep the general reader interested, however, it could have been even shorter if Hawking's mission was simply to let everyone know that the grand design is merely a joining of less-grand designs.<br /><br />The book follows the same template as A Brief History of Time and so a lot of material is repeated. In this sense there is a split between new readers and those that have read Hawking's other books. The introductory bits are necessary to lay the grounds for the later chapters but may seem old-hat and without detail to those only looking for physicist's latest insights. The Grand Design is a very good starting place for someone that has not read Hawking's other books.<br /><br />As for the conclusion that a unified theory of everything does not exist, its up to the reader to determine if M-theory is finished, or if its a work in progress.a lot of material is repeated.

B003CR9BYE|4.0|I believe the recording Sinatra wanted to dump is this one. Although every song must be compared  to a Sinatra version, and this is not exception, it is evident in this case that he was out of his element. There are highlights  throughout, his Girl from Ipanema has to be one of my favorites, but I can understand what it took him so long to get in the  bossa-nova bandwagon: The genre was not him.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Even with a shortened season due to the writers strike, season three delivered on the suspense and surprises along the road to save Dean from his cross-roads deal. The DVD set is well put together and the behind the scenes extras worth the time to take in. Like any fan there could always be more but what's here does the job wonderfully.
B00110K62U|5.0|This was as good as hoped for. My family and I have seen the musical live 3 times. This brought back great memories for all of us. The cast is indeed a \\"dream.\\" I can imagine the sets while the singers sang. Images were painted in my mind. I would say that it beneficial to have seen the show onstage but those who have not could still really enjoy the music immensely.

From its first episode, \\"In My Time of Dying\\" to it's conclusion \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\" parts 1 & 2; season two delivers a satisfying story arc both for main character Sam Winchester and the Winchester legacy as a whole.  The DVD set has great extras but of course for die-hard fans there could always be more.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|Great soundtrack containing the music of Brokeback Mountain. The instrumental pieces by Gustavo Santoallala is just beautiful and the songs really bring back memories of the film. When I listen to this CD, I'm bound to become emotional and so I have to make sure it's the right time and place to put it on! Wonderful collection of music which I will enjoy for a lifetime.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Short version:<br />Hooray!<br /><br />Only slightly longer version:<br />If the rest of the series is anything like this first book, we have a lot to look forward to: an engaging, fast-paced story that is also fun to read.  Most of the characters Brandon has introduced are both interesting and likable; he makes me care about what happens to them.  And, for the most part, the story's a real page turner... hard to put down.  Sure, there are a few places where things drag just a little.  But not for long.  Do yourself a favor... read this book.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I absolutely love this video and am so happy to be able to puchase it through Amazon-my favorite site. Amazon makes it affordable by offering thier used DVD's which are just as good as the brand new ones for much cheaper-which is a blessing in today's economy. Without Amazon's pricing, I probably would never be able to afford this DVD so a big thank you Amazon for always having the best products and the best pricing.
0553805371|5.0|As someone with a background in physics, I found this book hard to put down. It's a mystery story with the meaning and substance of reality as the prize. As a book topic, you can't be more ambitious than that. Although I found their reasoning sound, and I don't disagree with any of their conclusions (except one), I don't believe this is the final chapter of this story. There is one final piece, the answer to the question of why this perfect storm of physics created life. Yes, I understand the argument that if you try an infinite number of ways to make soup, sooner or later you're going to get chicken. That's the power of infinity. But I was taught in school that using infinity is cheating because it presupposes the answer. The theory of alternate histories says the probability of our universe existing is infinitesimally small. The fact that we do exist doesn't contradict that statement; it just means we're missing something. Although I believe this is a great book, in my view it needs a final chapter that doesn't rely on infinity to prove its case. I suspect there is much more to this mystery than we can now even imagine.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Este disco lo compré dado que estoy realizando mi propia colección (el otro lo tuve que dejar en casa de mi familia). Recuerdo cuando salió este album y me gustó mucho, de principio a fin. El disco se maneja en diferentes ritmos y por ningun motivo caen en la monotonía. Desafortunadamente, después vino la decadencia de su estilo y el disco que probablemente sea el último con la esencia de U2 es All that you can't leave behind, el cual puede ser un poco aburrido. En fin, este disco es una maravilla.
B00004RF98|5.0|One of my all-time favorite musicals.  It never fails to please.  It has EVERYTHING!  Great songs, great dancing, great plot, great stars and Donald O'Connor's super \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" number that is one of the best ever done.  He should have won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar just for that number.  Debbie Reynolds was a \\"baby\\" in that movie.  She literally danced her feet bloody in the \\"Good Mornin'\\" number because Gene Kelly was so fussy about her dancing.  Jean Hagen is wonderful as Lena Lamont, the squeaky movie queen.  Everything about this film is perfect!  Buy it and enjoy!!!
0553805371|2.0|Grand Disappointment. No way do Hawking and Mlodinow live up to the hype. I came to this book with an open mind, but it reads like a polemic for Scientific Pantheism. They've got a model that excludes God. So what? Models aren't reality. They begin the book by saying philosophy is dead, and then spend the next 200 pages or so proving they know nothing about philosophy. I was far more impressed by John Polkinghorne in his book, \\"Exploring Reality\\".

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I knew nothing about this HBO-produced film before watching it except that it was nominated for - and won - a slew of Emmy awards. I based my decision on that and I'm glad I did. I was aware that it had to do with a woman born with autism, but nothing more. Viewing the film with lack of further knowledge about the plot helped draw me in and I suggest that the less you know going in, the more you will enjoy it. Yes, I said, \\"enjoy\\". The script and direction make for some funny - or at least \\"smiling\\" moments as we follow Grandin's life. Its not all in chronological order and that may throw you off a bit. But stick with it.<br /><br />Claire Danes is truly amazing in the title role. If you watched the Emmy Awards you saw what the real Temple Grandin looks like and Danes has her mannerisms down perfect. (If you didn't see the Emmys, you'll get to see - and hear - Grandin in the all-too-brief \\"Making of\\" featurette (just five minutes!) which is included as a bonus. Grandin appears on the full-length audio commentary along with the Director and Writer for the film.<br /><br />If this was a film made for theaters, I'm sure there would be Oscar noms, but it probably wouldn't have received the exposure it got on cable TV. This is the reason HBO produces these high quality films. And the fact that it releases them on DVD, allows a larger audience to experience them.  This is one of HBO's winners!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B0018SY4OQ|5.0|This is a delightful book with pretty illustrations that my 6-year-old enjoyed.<br /><br />Contrary to what some people claim, it is not a political book. It advocates for nothing. It makes no claims about the penguins' sexual orientations. It is the factual telling of things that objectively happened. Two male penguins partnered, made a nest, and tried to hatch a stone. When they were given an egg to care for, they hatched it and raised the chick as competently as the male-female penguin couples around them did. Fact. It also mentions in passing that people live in different kinds of families, which is a fact too, whether you like or dislike that fact.<br /><br />I'm not sure why some reviewers felt the text was dry or boring. It was simple and factual, but it kept my squirmy kid interested. The illustrations of Tango hatching are absolutely adorable.
0307591549|5.0|We all like being happy, but most of us don't realize how much we actually need to be happy.  It's easy to continue to move ourselves down to the bottom of the priority list in order to take care of all the other things that matter in our lives.  And yet as we continue to push our own health and happiness to the side, our performance, not to mention our sanity, often becomes an afterthought.  The Happiness Advantage builds a very solid case that how we take care of ourselves significantly impacts our business.  It is clearly the responsibility of anyone who wants to perform at high levels to pay attention to the benefits that come to them when they not only chose to be happy, but they make \\"happiness a work ethic\\".  Thank you Shawn for bringing this information to us in a way that is easy to understand and apply to our daily routine.  This is truly a fun, informative and life inspiring message.
0312340958|5.0|Armstrong describes her experiences with a grace and generosity of spirit that blows me away. It would have been easy for her to be outraged and retaliatory for the treatment she endured, and I wouldn't have blamed her if she were; to be frank, I wonder if perhaps a little more anger, constructively applied, might not have done a lot of good for other young women. But it's not my place to second guess.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who said this book serves as a powerful warning; this is what happens when religious orthodoxy is not allowed to be challenged, this is what happens when we frame unquestioning obedience as the highest moral good and teach young people that accepting dogma is more desirable than exercising independent thought. The excesses of Mother Walter, the priest's sexual assaults, the suffering of Mother Bianca, were enabled by the unwillingness of others to question the hierarchy.<br /><br />It was shocking to see Armstrong's glaring health problems dismissed as \\"just nerves\\" not only by the nuns but by an actual doctor. A reminder of how far we've come.<br /><br />I'm glad for the world that an insightful, intelligent woman like Armstrong retained her mental facility intact. If there is a god, surely he gave her that facility, and surely he would want it to be used.
0439023513|5.0|This final installment of the Hunger Games trilogy left many feeling empty. In reality, that is the truth of war. What happens to the characters of this book post-war is truly believable, and truly sad. The only part I was sad about that I wish Collins had gave more information to was the bit about Gale suddenly not being in Katniss's life anymore. I understand that it would be too painful for the both of them, but I would have liked to have heard that Gale moved on as well or what his problems were after the war. I felt that the ending was very depressing, and I had to read it again to catch and understand the reasons why it was what it was, and for why our lovable Katniss and Peeta are now shells of their former selves.<br /><br />The book itself was fast paced and made me never want to put the book down, despite Katniss's depressions and the horrible realities of what was going on in the world and to characters we loved. I honestly had no expectations going into this book, because when you end Catching Fire, you know that the most horrible is yet to come. Don't get me wrong, there are a few uplifting moments to remind us why our characters are still resisting and trying to better their world. Despite these moments, there is nothing to truly heal the wounds of war, especially those had by our main characters.<br /><br />Anyone who has been around veterans who were witness or subjected to torture can attest that this much is true: this trilogy ended the way it had to, ended beautifully, and ended leaving me very teary. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone and everyone, because it is a glimpse into a strange future, where war and it's outcomes are not very different than today's. While The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were definitely more upbeat, more uplifting in some parts, I feel no one should feel cheated when they read the final book. Knowing that this is war, and that main characters have dealt with horrible things, should make it obvious that there will be no going back to who they once were. I am just happy that the Games have finally come to an end for Katniss and Peeta.ack to who they once were. I am just happy that the Games have finally come to an end for Katniss and Peeta.
B0012X3ZGK|5.0|This collection contains some truly exceptional live performances, as well as remixes of the original album tracks. This is a great album; very primal, no fat-and none needed with Paul Rodgers demonstrating why Jimmy Page once called him \\"the greatest living rock singer alive (he was Page's first consideration for Zep, but was unavailable-having recently formed FREE)\\".Get this-you won't be sorry...
6305268843|5.0|Firelight is an excellent movie that demonstrates the true love of a mother and her quest to find her daughter.
B00337KM2S|5.0|The DVD was just like a new one.  I was actually cast as an \\"extra\\" in that movie.  I can be seen for a few seconds just to the left of George Clooney on the dance floor at the wedding reception.  Since I am in it, I definitely wanted a copy.  My friend, (who was also cast as an extra, but you only see his bald spot) and I have shown it several times to our friends and family members.  We are very happy with the quality.  The movie was great!  I don't think I could have found a better price with the same quality anywhere else.
0316098337|5.0|When I first read the synopsis for this book I was worried that I might not enjoy reading a book told through the eyes of a five year old boy.  I felt that it was either going to come across  as too childish and possibly just annoy me, or he would come off as too mature for his age and therefore make it not credible enough for me.  I'm glad to report that I worried in vain.<br /><br />Ms. Donoghue gives you the chilling tale of \\"Ma\\" - who has been held captive in a shack for seven years by her captor, Old Nick.  Jack, our narrator, and the young boy who just recently turned 5 years old,  has lived his whole life inside \\"Room\\".  Let me explain, everything in Jack's world (in this case Room), is a proper noun, thus he uses words like Room, Bed, Table, Floor, Chair, Wardrobe, TV, etc., to describe the items scattered throughout his world.  He's never seen the light of day and what he does know about the outside he learns through the TV and his Ma's stories.<br /><br />When Ma concocts a bold plan to break free from Old Nick, brave, little Jack, will have to rely on his bravery and hope that luck can help them escape.<br /><br />I won't go too much into the storyline, because I feel that if you plan on reading  Room you should have limited knowledge of it (like I did) before you begin - this way you get more shock value as you read it.  What I will say is that Ms. Donoghue not only gives you an imaginative story but captures the love of a mother for her child so strongly that it will bring tears to your eyes.  Imagine living in a tiny room with nothing other than a bed, a bathroom, some household items and limited kitchen utensils.  Every Sunday Old Nick comes around (while Jack hides in his wardrobe) to visit Ma.  He knows to cover his eyes and ears until the bed stops creaking and Old Nick leaves.<br /><br />Considering the dark nature of this story - hearing it through Jack's eyes gives it a lighter feel.  Jack's voice was credible - his view of the world is unique and unforgettable.  His Ma was so resilient and fiercely protective of her child.  Her ability to teach Jack, keep him healthy, exercised, well-fed and dressed was so amazing to me.  You can't help but look up to her.  Her desperation to break free of that room and get back into the real world is painfully  felt - even though you only catch glimpses of it through Jack's eyes.<br /><br />All in all, this novel was superb.  It is thought-provoking, intense, emotional and powerful.  I can't recommend it enough.so resilient and fiercely protective of her child.

0805086846|4.0|Great book.  Should be mandatory reading.  Details precisely all the broken promises and treaties and how the US consistently went back on its words with regard to the Indians.
B003XU75QG|5.0|This album has great guitar rifts, catchy melodies, and fantastic vocals.  It's gritty, sexy, daring, and unapologetic.  Taylor has a great voice that certainly gets a chance to shine here.  Every song on the album gets stuck in the head.      If you are interested in good rock music with an in-your-face feel, then this album is a must-own!!
B003R0LBVW|3.0|UPDATE:  Finally, I finished the book and glad to say I am done, finished with the Berglands.  The only thing that kept me intrigued and reading was every now and again the character hits a nerve that resonates in one's own life...then proceeds to beat it to death till your eyes bleed....then moves on just as one is ready to throw the book across the room. I considered during the good times, buying another book by the author, but I'm not sure I can handle the emotional roller coaster.  This book is a yin and yang....I just wish the good stuff wasn't so run over with the overbaked.    I have to admit I am only 1/3 of the way through this monster book.  If it wasn't for the character buildup and humorous and painful account of life that will invariably hit a mark with most readers, I'm not sure I'd be this far.  I keep going, wondering when it is going to \\"open up\\" and get rolling, but it just might keep at this pace and drag me along with it.  This is NOT a cannot put it down riveting, nail biting book.  It is a long and rambling story that I am now reading in conjunction with a thriller of sorts that makes me feel as if I am not reading a Sociology of Life for Boomers textbook.  I'll report back in with a review when I either finish the book or misplace it once and for all.
0307454541|5.0|I really enjoyed this book although the subject matter was quite upsetting. It was well written and I can't wait to read the other two books in the series.
B002RSDW80|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Here are two comments:  - Scriptwriter Ephron often has characters annoyingly repeat phrases, e.g., \\"I will; I will.\\" \\"OK; OK\\", etc., etc.  - Streep's imitation is excellent, but I wonder if Child used that affected high-pitch 100% of the time?  Even in bed?
B00002DE7N|4.0|Pendulum shows a legendary band not *quite* on their A game.  Given the circumstances however, that can easily be forgiven.  CCR was on the verge of falling apart anyway.    \\"Born to Move\\" is my favorite song by far.  I love that verse melody, and the organ jam that follows is *amazing* and thankfully lasts for a pretty good bit of time.  I can't believe how good it is!  \\"Pagan Baby\\" has some guitar soloing that borders on mindless, but who cares- it's played tastefully and melodically anyway.  I wish the verse melody was better though- that *definitely* sounds mindless to me.    \\"Rude Awakening\\" is the bands idea of experimentation, and well, it definitely works for the first two minutes- I LOVE that guitar playing.  Then it gets... atmospheric and weird, haha.  I can't really explain what happens after the first two minutes, but I believe I hear muffled sounds of keyboards, saxophone and who knows what else.  Interestingly enough, an actual melody comes in about one minute before the entire experimental pieces comes to a much needed close!    I've never been a huge fan of \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\" and in all honesty, I tend to compare it to the superior \\"Who'll Stop the Rain?\\" from the bands previous album- Cosmo's Factory.  An unfair comparison perhaps, because they're both two completely different songs, but I can't help it!  Rain is rain!      \\"Hey Tonight\\" RULES.  One of my all-time favorite verse melodies.  \\"Wish I Could Hideaway\\" has a really sad introduction, and then Fogerty's vocals continue with the sadness vibe.  I love this song actually- it's pretty, but it packs a *serious* emotional punch.  Speaking of songs that make me feel like crying, \\"It's Just a Thought\\" is another major highlight.  I simply love that vocal melody.    The album also contains some pretty short, energetic rockers in \\"Chameleon\\" and \\"Molina\\", two excellet songs.      So there you have it guys- CCR delivers with a halfway decent album here, but never returns to their true form ever again.  An important part of musical history ended right here.  I'll say more than half of this album is terrific actually, and it's worth owning.  Cosmo's Factory and Green River are probably the bands best albums though.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is an amazing story.  It took a lot of guts to write from the perspective of a child, and the author pulled it off meticulously.  The reader feels the emotions of Jack and his mother through the eyes of a 5 year old.    Of course the book is a bit disturbing.  That is what makes it an amazing book.  It smacks you in the face with the scary underbelly of parts of our society, and makes you grapple with the reality that this kind of thing exists.  It is a book that you keep thinking about after you have put it down - if you can put it down.  I kept finding myself obsessively anticipating what happened next.    The author took a big chance in writing this book the way she did, and it really paid off.
6304711875|2.0|I don't get all the love for Scream.  It's not a particularly appealing movie to me.  I love slasher films when they're actually executed well, but this one misses the mark in WAY too many areas.      The films idea of building suspense through lengthy phone calls isn't the least bit frightening, and just about every one of the main characters are either very poor actors, or just terrible in this particular case.    The entire conclusion -without spoiling what happens- is terrible too.  It's bland, uninspiring and uninteresting writing to the extreme.      When it comes to slasher flicks, I like to see suspenseful segments leading to a gruesome and unforgettable outcome for the poor victims.  The violent segments here wouldn't be out of place on the Lifetime Movie Network, seriously.      It seems a trend is developing here- movies from the late 90's looked good back in the day, but the actual writing and storylines have dated horribly and aren't fun at *all* to watch  We're talking severely flawed storylines and execution.  I'm noticing this is especially the case with the horror genre.      Scream falls in the same exact category as other horror films from the same period in time, I'm afraid.  It's just not scary to me, and the borderline mockery of the whole slasher genre doesn't help either.
B000RIHBIE|4.0|Okay, I love Sum 41 for a very similar reason as other fans. My favorite songs are \\"Still Waiting\\", \\"Over My Head\\", \\"Hell Song\\", etc. Of course I was disappointed when I fisrt heard this album, but 1)after listening several times, I am becoming more and more fond of the songs and 2)change (and trying different things) is called \\"growth\\". When we experience growth, it's not always positive, but it's a process of maturing. I'm actually glad that after almost 10 years, Sum 41 is trying different styles instead of doing the same music all the time. If you are a fan, my advice is to give them a chance and watch them go through stages of growth, for better or for worse. If you listen to this album with generous and open mind, I promise you will become fond of the songs too. Change and growth don't have to be disappointing. And my final analysis is that I am not disappointed in this album.

1582701709|3.0|The Secret by Rhonda Byrne explains a philosophy for living one's desired life.  She explores the concept of attracting what one wants to one's life through thought, attitude, and expression.  She discusses how to adopt the philosophy into one's life and to create the specific things one wants in life. The chapters explain the concepts and provide examples by people who live by the philosophy of The Secret.  Each chapter ends with a summary of the chapter's concepts incorporating the actions the reader should take.  At times, the reader will think the concepts are so simple they should've thought of them long before.  Some claims included make perfect sense. Others will leave the reader with questions.  The Secret explains its concepts in easy to understand language and will provide the reader with insight into his/her own thought process at the very least.

0399156577|5.0|This is another great book by Nora Roberts. Definitely a page turner. You do not want to put it down. It has a great storyline that keeps you guessing. Loved it!!!
044654759X|4.0|Take a slice of the movie [[ASIN:B00009WVSL Sleeping With the Enemy]], add a dash of [[ASIN:0812980492 Black and Blue: A Novel]], increase the sappiness and you have a very tasty \\"Safe Haven\\"<br /><br />The mysterious Katie arrives in a beautiful small southern town and meets the local widowed grocer, Alex and his two young children.  After spending time together they fall in love.  Katie decides to tell Alex about her past and it is told periodically through flashbacks.  The flashbacks keep the story going and add suspense.  When Alex reflects upon his past with his deceased wife get out the tissues!  The story moves along well and has a very exciting conclusion.  There is also has a startling revelation at the end of the book that I did not want to believe (that's the twist!).  But as Sparks writes \\"...sometimes love can achieve the impossible.\\"
B003JTHXOK|3.0|OK! Love Sparks and this was a pretty good read but it was too much like Sleeping with the Enemy, I mean it  was almost idenical to it. The ending also left me a bit unsatisified. Quite frankley I kept pushing my next page button on my Kindle waiting for the ending.

0375701427|5.0|\\"American Pastoral,\\" the Pulitzer Prize winning 1997 novel by Philip Roth, is an elegy to Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov -- a former high-school athlete, childhood idol of his classmates, and hero to his community. Roth uses his recurring narrator, author Nathan Zuckerman, to imagine the tragic destruction of The Swede's happy, conventional, American-dream of an upper class life through the social and political turmoil of the 1960s; it's the story of a sudden slip from the \\"longed-for American pastoral\\" into \\"the fury, the violence, and the desperation of the counterpastoral - into the indigenous American berserk.\\"    If you've never read Philip Roth, here's the quick introduction. Roth is known for his complex but readable prose - he writes with a huge vocabulary and an uncanny ability to \\"turn sentences around\\" (as he calls it in \\"The Ghost Writer\\"). His novel often blur the distinction between reality and fiction, and he frequently provocatively addresses Jewish-American issues and American identity. \\"American Pastoral\\" rightly feels like his masterwork because it does all of these in equal parts. The novel is rife with confrontation; it's written with an underlying tension that continues to the last heartbreaking page. It's a pleasure to read, but more so a joy to dissect.    \\"American Pastoral\\" is rich and dense with thematic undercurrent that gradually reveals itself along the course of its pages. In the hands of a lesser writer, this breadth of thematic territory could be overwhelming and scattershot, but Roth manages it effortlessly. It's his characters that shoulder the weight of the meaning; these are deep, relatable, archetypical characters, each bolstered with supple backstories rife with politics, economics, social implications, generational rebellion, and those quiet formative moments that shape a person for a lifetime. Ultimately, Roth paints a portrait of three generations of an American family, and the rest of the story shakes out like dust from between thepages.    However, it's equally easy to dismiss Roth's characters (especially Swede Levov) as exaggerations -- impossible monuments that, no matter how flawed, simply don't behave as normal people would behave. But that's the point -- it's important to remember the framing of the story: the entire narrative of the Levov family is created in the mind of Zuckerman, based on only three brief conversations. The story is so immersive, in fact, that there are points in the narrative that we're removed from Zuckerman and Nathan's voice becomes Seymour's voice; it becomes his story as much as it is ours. As effective and believable as it is, ultimately, the entire novel is a construction of the writer Zuckerman. (And Zuckerman is a construction of the writer Roth... so go ahead and add another line of thematic density to your list.)    In the end, Roth (and Zuckerman) use duality to illuminate the thin rifts that divide us: how two very different wars created two very different generations, how strikingly thin is the line between order and disorder (in family, country, self, etc), how differently subsequent generations view the American dream. And as I sit on the precipice of fatherhood, I couldn't help but read the novel as a dissection of how little control parents have in controlling the worldview of their children, and how much influence children have in the worldview of their parents.

193413712X|5.0|This gripping novel begins with an old man dying in his bed.  As his body gradually shuts down, he reminisces (in his mind) about his life, sometimes in a fairly straightforward way, other times in a stream of consciousness that leaps abruptly from one topic to the next without warning.  The point of view later shifts to his father, who recounts his own life story; as we learn more about where the son came from and how he was brought up, we come to understand why he led the life he did.  The son repaired clocks for a living; throughout the book there are whimsical quotations from an 18th century work on clocks and clockmaking.  A truly remarkable first novel, well deserving its Pulitzer Prize.

B000008HZB|5.0|Jeff Lynne released \\"Armchair Theatre\\" #83, in the summer of 1990, hard to believe it's been 20 years already.  Jeff has only released 2 albums since \\"Armchair\\", ELO's \\"Zoom\\" in 2001 and The Traveling Wilbury's \\"Volume 3\\" in 1991.  Here Jeff wrote 8 songs and did 3 covers.  This is a very organic affair, not the pop gloss everybody was used to.  His first single was the #9 mainstream rock hit \\"Every Little Thing\\", with great sax work by Jim Horn.  His 2nd single was \\"Lift Me Up\\" a song that sounded like late period ELO, heard this a few times back in the day.  His covers he covered are \\"September Song\\", \\"Stormy Weather\\" they have that jazz feel to 'em.  The other cover is the twangy rock-a-billy tune \\"Don't Let Go\\".  Other great songs:  \\"What Would It Take\\", the indian chant song, \\"Now Your Gone\\", I think this is one of Jeff's best here.  And his statement for save the whales, \\"Save Me Now\\".  This album had some special musicians on here Ringo Starr, Tom Petty, and the late George Harrison and Del Shannon.  Jeff says he has an album he is doing, but i've never seen anything on it yet.  He is also producing Joe Walsh's next album, but I haven't seen anything on it either.  Jeff's going to be 63 years old at the end of the year, we need to speed things up here, Jeff won't live forever!  P.S.  New remaster came out April 23rd, 2013.  Excellent remaster, great sound, extra photo's nice text from David Wild and a funny liner from Eric Idle.  Nice bonus tracks in \\"Borderline\\" and the pleasant \\"Forecast\\".  If your a Jeff Lynne or ELO fan go out get the remaster.
0439023513|2.0|I'll keep this short.  I've spent the last few days re-reading the entire series.  But while I've read HG and CF probably 5-6 times each, I find it a struggle to read MJ for the third time.  I just can't get as swept away in the story as with the first two books.    SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS ***     This could be due to many reasons:  * didn't like that Katniss's story wasn't followed for most of the story  * didn't like how Gale turned out to be cold, even if it makes sense for his character  * didn't like that there weren't as many truly moving passages (I loved Rue's death scene, the song, the rope song; I lose count of how many times I wiped away tears in the first two books)  * Katniss ending up with Peeta made sense, but the conclusion with Gale wasn't satisfying    But really, I think the main problem was that I never got as emotionally invested in the third book as I did with the first two. It just didn't pull me in.  I just didn't care so much; and when I finished the book for the first time, I was simply disappointed, which says a lot given how much I loved the first two.  FWIW, I rarely reread books.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Very few albums were as good as Bruce Springsteen's \\"Magic\\" #1 in 2007, here he comes out guns a blazing with \\"Radio Nowhere\\" #75, \\"Just want to hear some rhythm\\", the plight of radio today.  Just looking at some of the reviews people seem to be harping about the sound of the album and not the music, it sounds alright and I can still hear pretty good.    Next is the sparkling \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\", followed by \\"Livin' In The Future\\"- \\"Don't worry darlin' now baby don't you fret\\".  Bruce and Clarence and the gang shine here, has that 60's sound from the old days. Could of easily been off \\"The River\\".    \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\"- \\"Your own worst enemy has come to town\\".  The string laden mid-temo ballad, very Phil Spectorish.    \\"Gypsy Biker\\"- \\"We rode her into the foothills\\".  A Darkness on the edge of town type sound, good harmonica and guitar  solo by Bruce also.    \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\"- #95  \\"She went away, she cut me like a knife\\".  A highlight on summer radio in 2007, another string arrangement with the Spector wall of sound.    I'll Work For Your Love\\"- \\"Your tears, they fill the rosary at your feet, my temple of bones\\".  The piano tinkling of Roy Bittan lead off this track, very uplifting song, Soozie Tyrell's violin works MAGIC here.    \\"Magic\\"- \\"I got a rabbit in my hat\\".  Has that \\"Rising\\" feel to it.    \\"Last To Die\\"- \\"Faces of the dead at five.\\"  A favorite of mine, they should play this in his concerts, it's a great song!  Again Soozie plays a great violin, Max plays some strong drums here.    \\"Long Walk Home\\"- \\"In town I passed Sal's grocery, the barbershop on south street\\".  A very touching uplifting song, about coming back to his hometown, great guitar break by Bruce here, with the BIG MAN's sax also.    \\"Devils Arcade\\"- \\"Desert dust on your skin\\".  Great cello by Daniel Laufer, a war themed song(could be any war), a very anthematic song.

0817439390|5.0|I am not a fast reader or do I really enjoy it. I found this book to be a real easy book to read and follow. Very well worth the money. There are lots of illustrations and the book is well laid out.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|I just bought this CD and could not be more happy! I love Patrick's voice and his talent just shines through on this album. It is rare for me to play a CD the whole way and not skip to the next song but these boys are just so great. I know some of the diehard fans dislike this CD but you have to admit that everybody changes over the years and I believe they are still one of the greatest band EVER!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This album is epic! One of the best ever made. It will take you on a journey from beginning to end.
B003O85W3A|5.0|This is a fantastic album from a fantastic group. The Springsteen influences are very obvious, but they approach the sound in a fresh way. This is an album that demands you listen to it in its entirety-- if you don't, you just aren't getting the full picture. The Arcade Fire manage to segue the tracks into one another quite seamlessly, which makes it difficult to stop listening. Their sound on this LP is more polished than 2004's Funeral but less overproduced than 2007's Neon Bible (in other words, a good compromise). There is a bit of restraint here, mostly in Win Butler's voice, and occasionally in songs that hold back (like City With No Children). But there are standouts as well-- notably Ready to Start, a throbbing punk number, We Used to Wait, a subtly urgent piano-fueled rocker, and Month of May, a sizzling, searing visceral experience. If you like the Arcade Fire, it'll be hard not to like this. If you don't like or haven't heard of the Arcade Fire, this is a good place to start, as it's their most accessible album yet.    Overall, this is an album that can't be missed. The themes are timeless but extraordinarily relevant. The sheer length of the album is surprising but completely satisfying. Finally, listening to it is just a wistful -- and occasionally contemplative-- experience.
0553808001|5.0|If you're a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire and want to know what the castles of Westeron look like before the HBO series, here's your chance. And, the artwork is by the BEST and brilliant Ted Nasmith who has done a lot for Lord of the Rings. Now was his chance at something new and different. He worked closely with Martin on this project and it doesn't disappoint. Order it today!

1439181780|5.0|It's one of the life changing books and has been written with an open heart and love. As it said, life is miracle and simple. we all want to have more peace and joy in the world. The book tells us everything begins with our feelings and thoughts, and gives us practical information on how to adapt this knowledge into our day-to-day life. I think everyone should read this book and practice, and see the outcomes....so amazing!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is a must see for everyone.  It shows the conditions under which our meat, poultry and other food is grown and produced.  Very few farms would open their doors to this very real and honest film crew.  It is an eye-opener.  Sad to realize that too many families can't afford to eat healthy fruit and vegetables, and by necessity have to eat cheap \\"dollar menu\\" hamburgers and fast food.  A family of 5 only had enough money to buy 5 or 6 dollar hamburgers - they couldn't afford enough fresh produce to feed everyone.  Watch this documentary and be enlightened about the food you eat.  \\"You may never look at dinner the same way again.\\"
B000008JI1|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST THING POISON EVER RECORDED. RICHIE KOTZEN REALLY SHINES ON THIS CD. STAND, STAY ALIVE, UNTIL YOU SUFFER(FIRE AND ICE), BASTARD SON OF A THOUSAND BLUES ARE ALL FANTASTIC.  SOLID WRITING AND PLAYING BY THE WHOLE GROUP.
B003NX76BM|4.0|Great if you love dogs, as I do.  More than enough sexy scenes, a surprising number of laugh-out-loud situations, all in all, a good read.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Looks great on my 40 inch Samsung 1080p, I just really need some surround sound to get the full effect with these action films. this was recommended from my friend and said to get a bunch of Action films to get on bluray, so I chose this and a few others, but this looked great, quality was top notch, sound was great, even though I was using just my TV speakers.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Was slow to buy the series after watching the movie, figured the tv show quality, acting, special effects etc would be poor....I was wrong could not get enough of this show, excellent, excellent, excellent.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I am totally a non-tech person, and this is idiot-proof.  If you just want to transcribe your vinal to the comptuter and then to CD's without any thought process involved, this is perfect.  There are only two parts to attach and the belt to be stretched over the pully.  One thing.  Don't forget to raise the little plastic loop on the needle before you use it.  And if you want to playback on your computer, you have to unplug the USB plug first, and then remember to put it back when you transcribe again.  And if you don't have speakers, you'll have to buy them separately.  For the money this is a very good deal.
0670021652|5.0|I was totally engrossed with the book and loved it. Ms. Gilbert paints a beautiful picture of every aspect of the story which I appreciate so much when reading fiction and non-fiction alike. I felt like I was there with her on every page of her journey.
B0029XZODY|1.0|I am glad that Amazon sent me a review because it reminded me of what I ordered.  It has been over a month and I still have not received the item.  The shipping still says it is being shipped.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS USERS!!!!

B00361DR4Q|5.0|This opera was beautifully-staged, well-shot and the sound is excellent.  Great performances too...but I'm not an aficianado so I won't presume to deliver a review on that score.
044654759X|4.0|I was soo excited for this book to come out!!  I bought the book for the Kindle app and read it on my phone.  The book was really great and I had a hard time putting it down.  It wasn't the usual all lovey dovey book by Sparks. It had a suspense element that I loved!  It was pretty predictable and it kept reminding me of the movie Sleeping with the Enemy.  It wasn't one of his best books but it was still a great book!
B001Q8FRMQ|5.0|Yes, yes, yes Gainsbourg was well ahead of his time. Moving here from France 10 years ago I was pleasantly surprised to find out that a lot of people knew and dug that record. Gainsbourg was France's bad boy, always chain-smoking and always drunk out of his head whenever on stage or tv, especially late in his career. Go watch the youtube video where he makes a crude LIVE pass on Whitney Houston on French tv. I still remember seeing it and laughing my head off more than 20 years ago! Or when he set a 500 franc bill on fire ($100) in another tv show just to let people know that he did not care about money. He was this flamboyant character who became a jazz musician for fear of being a bad painter. He used to say that music was a second choice to him. He was an agent provocateur, his lyrics are full of sexual references, some very plain, some hidden under 'double sens' which he absolutely mastered. Some of his music was even censured on French radios before the advent of FM in the 80's which tells you a lot.  Histoire de Melody Nelson was not well received when it came out. It was so different from what he had done before that people were put off. It was a commercial failure and it took time for people to dig it. But I guess this is normal for something so avant-garde and new. Most of the credit went to Gainsbourg although Jean-Claude Vannier, who is credited with the arrangements, later went on saying that he pretty much wrote the whole thing. Vannier's mark on the music is indeed huge as his other solo records attest. Histoire de Melody Nelson was definitely co-authored.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|This DVD shows once again what U2 is all about! This is an amazing report of there latest concert series shot in in a never seen before manner!  A once in a lifetime experience, not to miss even if you're not that big a fan.  This 2 boxset also features a documentary on how the \\"claw\\" whas designed and built. Very interesting, and it also shows how professional a group U2 really is.  Outstanding!!!
B0037YOMWS|4.0|I never liked the TI BA2+ because it has stiff mushy keys that have no tactile feedback. I made tons of data entry mistakes because of this.  Meaning that I had to always do my work twice just to ensure I got the same answer. I got rid of it after a week. The professional edition was better but still had keys that weren't responsive.  I now use my calc at work so I can't afford the time to redo my calculations.  Time=money. I wanted something more modern than the 12c since that calc is so old and archaic.  Well this 30b fits the bill.  It's a modern system with two line display, complete with the menuing system that the TI's use... Super fast... results come up instantly.  But best of all is the tactile keypad that gives a solid click to your finger so you know you pressed it.  Keys are weighted just right so your fingers learn the proper amount of resistance to use. Display is crisp and easy to read.  Only con?  The rear of the calc is weird.. looks like they took some cheezy HP glossy black laptop case and recycled it for this calc!! I don't understand why it couldn't be metal just like the faceplate. Well, can't have it all I guess.  Another issue is that this calc doesn't seem to be sold very many places.  I could not find it anywhere in local stores, only online.  There's also no instruction manual just a quick start guide.  Finally, the soft cover case is horrible.  Very stiff and poor quality..
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great movie!  The Blu-Ray is crystal clear. Kind of sad at the beginning of the movie but changes pace quickly.  Everyone I've spoke to liked it. Funny little asian kid trying to get a merit badge.  Definitely worth seeing!  This comes with 4 discs. DVD, Blu- Ray, digital copy for your iPhone or whatever, and a bonus extras disc.
B001U0D786|5.0|I was in Singapore and my purchase was to an address in Washington, USA.  This purchase was a gift to my friend in Washington and I was concern that it may not reach there in time.  My worries were unfounded.  The product reach my friend in good time and in good condition.  Thanks.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|simply superb television series that takes its viewers on an emotional roller coaster in an ocean of questions. Lost laid the ground works for the necessities in a television drama. it is the quintessential of modern television programs.    the product its self comes in a very large very exciting box with gifts and games. the actual seasons look like tall books of religious scripture that come in a stone like tablet. the box is a cardboard box with layers of texture to make the sets appearance look as if it came from a temple. Opening the box was like Christmas for me. I was a dedicated follower of the show since the beginning and waiting to buy the box set season on blu ray was the best decision i have ever made.     The box weights about 7.8lbs and comes with loads of bonus features including an extra 12 minutes to answer some of the millions of leftover mysteries about the island. overall I'm extremely satisfied with the product and its very nice to be able to relive the emotional journey that is lost.
0765326353|5.0|The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson has pretty much everything I want in epic fantasy: a wide range of characters from kings to commoners, magical powers, mysterious prophecies, ancient artifacts, terrifying monsters, unstoppable assassins, desperate battles, honor, treachery, thievery, and treasure. I'll admit it took me a while to really start to like Kaladin, the first of the major characters to be introduced, but by the end of the book I admired all of the major viewpoint characters, and many of the minor ones, too.<br /><br />The book is the first in a series of ten books, so naturally it leaves several plot threads open at the end.  But there were also several story arcs that reached some form of resolution by the end, so the book felt satisfying.
144471032X|5.0|I have read many books about dieting but this one approaches the problem in a different way.  Im planning to finish the book before starting the diet. The good thing is that there  is a follow up plan after you have lost the pounds you wanted to lose, so you dont feel alone  and lost!
B003D0ZNWY|4.0|The 16 CD set of all Mahler's works was all I had hoped for. I have some other CDs of Mahler that I like a little better because they are a little more familiar through repetitive listening, but the recording, the lush, inventive orchestration, and the mix of emotional response to Mahler's works help feed the soul.     I would certainly buy this again.

0765340798|5.0|THE BATTLE OF CORRIN is the last of the Legends of Dune trilogy, preceded by THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD and THE MACHINE CRUSADE. They are the first three novels in the Dune series, started by Frank Herbert and filled out by co-authors Kevin Anderson and Brian Herbert (Frank's son). Though more releases are planned, for the correct chronological order of all 17 mainstream novels that exist as I write, go here: http://www.amazon.com/Dune-Saga-Chronological-Order/lm/1COADLEGRZEOC<br /><br />Brian and Kevin are not the most skillful authors. Here and there, they hedge on plausibility and are unconvincing. But maybe I am picayunish. For the most part, they do their job. They are very readable, and they open a portal to an alternate universe that would not be accessible without them.<br /><br />These first three books in the Dune series immerse readers in the struggle of a galactic human commonwealth versus an empire of thinking machines. The stage is as big as outer space, set-decorated with starships and far-out technology, scripted with passion and political drama. Also--consistent with Frank--Kevin and Brian's stories involve some characters with paranormal powers.<br /><br />THE BATTLE OF CORRIN wraps up the trilogy neatly.  But if you appreciate the story, characters, and tech as much as I did, do not stop here. Whenever you have an appetite for good, clean science fiction return to this universe. Try SISTERHOOD OF DUNE. Then proceed to the Prelude to Dune (HOUSE ATREIDES, HOUSE HARKONNEN, HOUSE CORRINO).
B0037RDPEG|4.0|Oh how I loved the Italian setting and wanted to be right by Liz's side, I could practically taste the food and see the sights... But oh how I wish I had never taken the trip to India and endured Liz's self absorbed and draining monologues.  Bali was the happy medium between the two and offered some romance to an otherwise dreary life experience.  Bali didn't get me back to the highlights of Italy so in the end, I was left disappointed.
0307454541|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read! I bought this book because the waiting list at the library was so long. Being in such demand I decided I would purchase the book instead of waiting. Big mistake. Too much hpye over a really bad book. What the outcry on this book is for being great is beyond me. Very hard to understand all the Swedish names and places and too many characters to keep up with. Needless to say I donated the book to the library since I had no reason to keep it. Spoke to a few people that have read it and they agreed that this book was really awful. Save your money.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|\\"Little Dorrit\\" is a wonderful period piece with superb acing and marvelous recreation of the 19th century. It is amazing that I never tire of seeing these productions because they are so masterfully done and truly transport one back in time.
0307454541|3.0|Dragon Tattoo is one of the hardest books that I've ever had to review. I say that because although the mystery was pretty good, I got no pleasure whatsoever out of the characters. That is, I kept reading the book because I simply wanted to know how it ended. Recall the feeling one has when reading a book where you actually feel like you and the main character are one of the same, or when you have the overwhelming feeling to get down there in the trenches with the characters. I did not experience anything like that with Dragon Tattoo. Lisbeth and Mikael, as characters are, to quote my cousin \\"boring as dry toast\\". The heroine, Salander is mildly entertaining at best, and Blomvist is as exciting as a root canal. Lisbeth's talents are nothing to write home about and what with them being flaunted around at every chance Larsson gets it seems as if he were trying to make Salander into some type of superhero. Mikael appears to be an extension of the author himself, since both are journalists who own their own magazine. Blomvisk only seems to have the ability to drink coffee, eat sandwiches, and have sex. Blomvisk's success in solving the mystery is mostly because of the extensive outside help. As far as I could see, Lisbeth did most, if not all of the work, while Blomvisk slept with the females of the Vanger family. As I mentioned earlier, the mystery part is really the only thing that kept me interested in this book. I don't see myself picking up Played With Fire or Hornet's Nest anytime soon.<br /><br />In a nutshell:<br />Mystery = Good<br />Characters = Boring
0307594777|5.0|This is a magnificent series.  I had seen the Swedish film, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" and decided that I wanted to own and read the entire series.  Brilliantly written and translated.  The only sad note is that this wonderful author died in 2004 and is unable to enjoy seeing his immense popularity and the reader will know that there will bot be anything further to read by Stieg Larrson unless someone finds a lost manuscript.  These novels will not dissappoint the reader.
0374158460|4.0|Very good, NOT great    The publicity machines couldn't have had been overheated in the weeks before Freedom came out, the worshipful reviews of the drooling critics, the Time magazine cover designating Jonathan Franzen THE contemporary great American novelist. Perhaps it's not fair to measure Freedom against the bar set buy all the hype - only a handful of novels ever written withstand measurement up by that metric. What it is a well-written snapshot American life in the 2000s.   The best thing about Freedom is the well-drawn characters. The three main characters Walter, Patty and Richard each has enough virtues, struggles, flaws and quirks to make him/her life and breath. None of them are particularly likeable.     One of the book's weaknesses is the sections which are supposed to be an autobiography written by Patty as part of her therapy. There is nothing about the voice in the section that makes it at in any way distinct from Franzen's voice as the narrator. The use of the language, the sentence structure, the vocabulary are exactly the same as the whole rest of the book. There was nothing there that would remind that reader that this was supposed to be the voice of a woman --a quirky, depressed, intelligent, non-self-actualized woman who doesn't quite have enough self-awareness to get at the source of her frustrations.     The plot of the novel is workable and strong enough to hold the readers interest. Walter makes a career for himself as an environmentalist and takes a job the head of a trust dedicated to saving a particular species of bird, the Cerulean Warbler. Environment concerns make a worthy foundation on which to hang a plot of a book set in the 2000s, at least until the later days when the recession and joblessness became the main concern of the times.      The gentrification efforts on the part of Walter and Patty which is unappreciated by their working class neighbors rings true to the time before the housing bubble burst. However, the references to the 9/11 attacks, peccadilloes and real abominations associated the George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, the culture of corporate welfare in Washington DC all seem a bit thrown in and like Franzen was trying to cover all bases and makes the book feel a less focused than might have been, though the skewering of greedy corporate types, the hypocrisy liberal yuppies is the most fun aspect of the book. One gets the impression that Franzen had a lot of fun with these sections of the book.    The bottom line: I probably would have liked this book much better if I had not been exposed to all the hype. As it is, I was disappointed.  Obviously, Freedom is a good book. But does it place Jonathan Franzen in the pantheon of great American writers with on Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edith Wharton and Ernest Hemingway? NO, nowhere close.  It's only fair to judge the book on its on merits. I was torn whether I should rate Freedom with four stars or five. On a 0-100 scale I would give it around a 90.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|We are Dexter-fanatics.  We hadn't watched the show at all until we heard several different people comment on how good the show is.  So, early 2010 we bought seasons 1-3 and watched them rapidly.  We couldn't wait for season 4.  When we received the box from Amazon with season 4, we knew we had to cancel our weekend plans.  Instead, we stayed home and watched the whole season.  Knowing we couldn't wait for Season 5 on DVD, which presumably will be Aug. 2011, we went ahead and ordered Showtime so we could watch season 5 as it's happening.  It's a sickness, I know, but I don't want the cure....I want Dexter!

B002BWP4A6|5.0|This film feels as thought it was actually filmed in the years before WWI - it is a frightening story that will leave the viewer with much to think about and to discuss with others who have seen this German film noir.  It has to be one of the best films I have seen in years.  I saw it in the movie theater and it was so provocative that I decided to buy the DVD so I could watch it again together with the extras on the disc.  It is allegorical and portrays evil for evils sake.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|No matter how small you picture this pool to be, its a little smaller.  Which in my opinion is a good thing, unless you are trying to pack a dozen kids in it.  However, three or four kids, have a great time.  The pool comes with the slide, palm tree, 2 inflatable animals, an inflatable floating coral and some rings to toss.  Plug in the house and the pool spouts dozens of four feet high streams of water.  If you have an air compressor, set up is quick, and all the parts do fill properly and stand up. It might as well be a water park for all the fun and excitement it generates. We've left it outside in the elements with kids bouncing in and out of it for the past two months, and it's held up.<br /><br />The only downside is that it my kids never want to get out.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|No other musician has captured my heart and soul like this man did, and his music touched deep parts of my soul so much that unexpected tears arose with the awesomeness of his abilities making love to that guitar.  Not since SRV have there been the pure passion and talent from a performer who brings out the best in every guitar like no one else could.  SRV was definately smiling down from above on the Bonamassa talent showcased here.  My husband walked into the room and had the same reaction.  My kids came in and were dancing and playing air guitar right along with this amazing concert.     I had never heard of Bonamassa before, and had I not happened upon this concert being aired on television, I might have missed this golden opportunity.     The ultimate blues guitar talent has returned and it is Bonamassa who I hope will hold that title for a long time.  I had hoped that John Mayer would step up to that plate but his talent has been mismanaged.  His band refuses to yield to Mayer's talent and plays to loudly over his poorly chosen solos, but I digress.    The guitar god, Eric Clapton even shows up to play with Bonamassa and from the look on his face, you can tell that even he is impressed with Bonamassa's talent.  I dare to admit that bonamassa puts Clapton's talent to shame, and I still think Clapton is the godfather of the blues guitar.      Have I mentioned this man is nothing short of AMAZING?    I had to wait until payday to make this a part of our collection.  Bonamassa should not be missed and this is a must have for everyone's collection.  You will NOT be disappointed.
0307269752|5.0|A little hard to get started but most all novels are, but it really held my interest. The more I read, the more I wanted to not put it down.
B003F3NDP8|1.0|In my opinion this was the worst season ever. I stopped watching right in the middle and bought the DVD just for collectors reasons, because I own the other seasons, too.    To my disappointment there is no large box any more. Just a typical cheap plastic DVD amaray case with a paper cover around it. It looks very ugly in my shelf and I think I will gonna sell it.     This show is dead for me nov and I do not think it will getting better in the next season.
