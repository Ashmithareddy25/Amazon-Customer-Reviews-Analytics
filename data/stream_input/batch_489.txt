B0002Z0EYK|3.0|As far as spectacle goes, Troy is a pretty good movie. Battle scenes are well-mounted and executed, there is a lot of action, and lots of pretty faces play all of the key roles. My basic disappointment with the film is the portrayal of Achilles (Brad Pitt) as something of a two-dimensional, emotionless, skirt-chasing murderer of many.<br /><br />My reading of the Iliad did not reveal Achilles as being quite so enamored of the fact that he'd (had to?) kill so many adversaries. This Achilles also seemed to be something of a rather cruel womanizer, too; a bloodless, almost lifeless, conquerer of the fairer sex. I really did not see the *passion* engendered by the man who was like a god to the Greeks, including Alexander the Great.<br /><br />That seems to be the main failing of this picture. It conveys little of the true ardor that the story of Troy raised in the blood of Homer's readers, nearly all historians of the era, and early-to-contemporary archaeologists and anthropologists. A better source of the fervor felt by those who have searched all of their lives for Homer's Troy (and eventually found it), try reading (I know, it's not as much fun as watching!) Michael Woodards (Woodward's?) book,<br /><br />Another minor quibble, given that Hollywood is frequently dismissive of the bakground of characters, real or imagined, is that Helen is played by a very modern-looking, blue-eyed blonde. Other than to say that she was considered the fairest woman in all of Greece, Homer is silent on the details of Helen's looks, but no Greek I've ever met - man or woman - is quite so \\"fair\\" in the Northern European way that this actress is. Connie Nielsen as \\"Drucilla\\" in \\"Gladiator\\" was a much better casting choice.
0446608955|5.0|The book, A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, is a very moving book that draws the reader in and makes them feel as if they are in the story. The book is about a seventeen year old boy named Landon, and the Baptist minister's daughter, Jamie who both live in the small town of Beaufort, North Carolina.  <br />As a last resort, Landon decides to ask Jamie to the prom. Jamie says that she will go with him, but he has to promise not to fall in love with her. Landon, not believing what he just heard, doesn't have to think twice about promising, who would fall in love with Jamie? After the prom though, Landon starts spending more time with Jamie than he ever thought he would, and questions if he has kept his promise. Then Jamie tells Landon her biggest secret, and neither of their lives will ever be the same.  <br />This book is very descriptive and brings you into the mind of Landon Carter. You are destined to feel all of his happiness as well as all of his pain. The book will make you laugh and cry. This young love story was very well written and will draw you in right from the first page. I would recommend this book to everyone from teenagers to adults. This is a story for anyone who knows what it's like to be in love.  <br />Danielle <br />
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I really liked this movie when I saw it on satellite. But when I tried to buy the widescreen 1.85:1 Dolby 5.1 on the new and used section here, I got a fullscreen 4:3 Dolby 2.0 version instead. Nothing in the sale listing to warn me that the seller was substituting a less expensive version. Beware !
0441172717|5.0|Dune is probably the greatest Science Fiction book you can find, excluding Fantasy. If I were to recommend someone (especially someone who doesn't read Science Fiction) a Science Fiction novel, Frank Herbert's Dune is what I would primarily recommend. Frank Herbert adds myriad, quite verbose and hard to read details to intensify the condition of this story. While these details may be considered unneeded to some people, without them many people would probably be reading Arabian Nights even though these two books are scarcely similar.  <br /> <br />Frank Herbert creates a nearly uninhabitable landscape for the moisture-lacking desert planet of Arrakis for the Atreides family including Paul, the main character, to live on. However, Arrakis was once inhabited by House Atreides' archenemy, House Harkonnen and is also currently inhabited by Arrakis natives called Fremen during the story. The Fremen are an intelligent race that do everything they can to survive on the planet which includes wearing special suits called stillsuits to preserve the \\"body's water.\\"  <br /> <br />Adding yet another variable to the living conditions on Arrakis are the colossal sandworms; many are larger than whales. They reside under the sand and can hear movements on the sand's surface. They hunt down travelers and spice factories alike, completely consuming anything moving on the surface of the sand. Fremen have adapted to this way of life but people like the Atreides have much to learn.  <br /> <br />There are two things that are valuable on Arrakis. One is water and the other is mlange spice. Spice is the only reason why people other than Fremen inhabit Arrakis. It is the major export and profit maker of Arrakis. It is addictive like a drug to and is prized among the wealthy outside Arrakis. Atreides make portable spice factories to mine this spice despite their high vulnerability to sandworms.  <br /> <br />15 year-old Paul Atreides has intelligence beyond perceptibility in this novel. He is the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, leader of the Great House Atreides. Much of his intelligence comes from special training, but it is easy to doubt this is where he gets all of his superhuman adeptness. He is burdened by a self-founded \\"terrible purpose.\\"  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book. It isn't a book that I couldn't put down. It's too much of a mind-draining book to read it continuously for hours. I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book all at once. Dune gives you an idea of how good your present living situations are compared to the characters in this book. This is a book that I would have regretted not reading. <br /> <br />Tyler H.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Gen. George S. Patton was an @$$hole. He was also one of the finest combat commanders the US ever produced. He could be extremely loyal, mourn the wounds of his men and at the same time shamelessly spend the lives of those men in pursuit of his own glory. He had a myriad of faults and quirks but he also had some really fine, almost anachronistic qualities. In short, he was a very complex individual. This film depiction does a magnificent job of bringing all of that out. <br /> <br />George C. Scott earned his oscar in this role. He captured the complexity of the man who was George Patton and does so with style and vigor. The warts are there but so is the genius, the charismatic leadership and the thirst for glory. <br /> <br />Carl Malden does no less a job in his portrayal of Omar Bradley, a vastly different type of character than Patton. The two film personalities complement each other as well as the historical ones ever did. <br /> <br />This movie was rightly hailed as a masterpiece. It did not just portray Patton's real achievments. Those were spectacular enough for a movie without all the character study. This film provides more, however. It gives the character study. It gives a glimpse of understanding of the complexities that made up the historical figure. Even more remarkable, it does so in an entertaining manner.
074353946X|4.0|With several different groups to follow such as NASA, a presidential race and politics in general, I found myself re-listening to some of it over again so I was sure that I understood the story line.  The in-depth details reminded me of Tom Clancy's writing.  There were also a host of colorful characters -Senator Sedgewick Sexton, his daughter Rachel, Zack Herney, Gabriel Ash, William Pickering and Michael Tolland - just to name a few.<br /><br />Rachel is an intelligence analyst employed by the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office).  She has been asked by the President to help verify the authenticity of a meteorite found in the Arctic ice.  She is flown to the site and meets Michael Tolland, an oceanographer who is also there to verify the meteorite.<br /><br />The President is scheduled to break the news to the country in a news conference.  Within minutes of the conference, Rachel and Michael begin to suspect that all is not as it should be with this discovery.  They try to stop the President but are thwarted by Marjorie Tench, chief of staff.  It seems everyone wants this discover to be true; some for good and others have an agenda all their own.  To find out if the facts are true or not, Rachel, Michael and two other scientists go into the Artic landscape.  They are ambushed; one of the group is killed and the rest are left for dead.  Shifting ice saves their lives and a submarine in the Artic depths rescues them.  Armed with the knowledge that all is not right, the hunt for the truth begins in earnest.<br /><br />Who is a friend, who is a foe?  Keep listening because all is not as it seems.  There is lots of scientific gear, high tech computers secret weapons and fast-paced action to make you want to read until you figure out \\"who-done-it\\".  This reader never saw the \\"who\\" until the author revealed the answers.<br /><br />Richard Poe was well chosen as the reader of this book.  His inflections allow you to distinguish between the people speaking with little difficulty and he never sounds bored or tired of doing the reading.  Dan Brown has a winner in Deception Point.ficulty and he never sounds bored or tired of doing the reading.  Dan Brown has a winner in Deception Point.
0671319809|5.0|After so completely enjoying the 4th volume of the Honor Harrington series, I was anxious to begin the 5th but there was trepidation as well. It could not possibly be as good as the 4th. Instead, it was even better.<br /><br />All of this comes after my mediocre reception of the 3rd volume. \\"Flag in Exile\\" deftly handles the problem I perceived in the thrid book. Flag captains just don't have as much opportunity to shine as independant commanders. It should be worse for an admiral with a fleet command. Weber solves this problem quite handily in that Honor's responsibilities as an admiral are a very minor part of the story. Mostly, she spends her time defending herself and her minions from those arrayed to destroy her. The attack her and all around her with both savagery and depravity. She, on the other hand, maintains an honorable and admirable stance throughout. In the end, she destroys almost all of her enemies and then takes on the enemy fleet for good measure. Even so, there are enough political enemies and foreign enemies to ensure at least a few more great books after this one.<br /><br />Again, Weber does a great job melding the institutions of the British Royal Navy in the Napoleonic era with space opera. There is not as much technical analogy in this volume as in others. Instead, political analogies abound. Rob S. Pierre is the chairman of the Committee for Public Safety of Haven. Robespierre must be twisting in his headless grave! There are also analogies which can be drawn with other societies and times. The SS makes an appearance. There is even much that can be seen in our modern world.<br /><br />Buy this book but read the others first. This one can stand alone but stands so much better with all of the previous story in place.
B00004Z459|2.0|When I got into Linkin Park a couple of years ago, I was pretty new to the whole music scene.  I was pretty impressionable at the time and after listening to this album, it was just about all I listened to.  Now, me reviewing this album a few years later, I realize it is not good at all.  When comparing Linkin Park to many others groups on the Metal/Nu-metal music scene like Tool and Chevelle, I realize Linkin Park is far inferior.  Here's a couple of reasons why: <br />1) Awful guitars.  The guitarist plays the same 2 chords over and over again.  Wow, the words \\"guitar solo\\" would never even come into the ears of this band's members. <br />2) Nonexistent Bass. Bass? What bass? Oh right, that instrument that nobody can even hear. <br />3) Annoying Vocals.  Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist, has a voice that's so annoying.  He sounds like a girl who hasn't even started puberty yet. <br />4) Rapping.  I hate rap and the fact that it dominates the music scene.  And even more of a disgrace, Linkin Park combined with Jay-Z for an album. Now, I have lost all respect for them. <br />5) Manipulated by Recording Company.  These guys are just the tool of the record company who tries to pump as many singles out of these guys as they can and controls their lyrics with the same, monotonous lyrics in every song. <br />There you have it, Linkin Park.  Please don't call these guys metal.  If you want to hear TRUE metal, listen to Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, early Metallica, Megadeth, etc. or if you want good nu-metal listen to Korn, Mudvayne, System of a Down or even Slipknot.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|This movie is only for die hard fans. It is all spoken in Japanise, but there are English subtitiles. The Graphics are realistic. I love the way they kept the main characters in 2-d and the back ground in 3-d. It makes it like the comic strip witch the movie was baised off of.
B000002UAR|5.0|That's it. Revolver by The Beatles is THE recording of modern music history. It's the greatest album that has ever been released. It has never been matched and probably never will. A long review is not necessary from me...if you listen to only one album in your entire life, make it \\"Revolver\\". You'll never want anything else.
0316776963|1.0|I had this recommended to me as laugh out loud funny. However I only got a few smiles throughout. It just wasn't that funny. The stories had a lot of potential, but the writing wasn't that good, and didn't make the most of potentially funny material. Skip this one.
0792846443|5.0|Writer Paul Sheldon gets into a horrible accident. When he wakes up he finds himself in the house of a women claming to be a nurse (Kathy Bates). She's also his number 1# fan as she puts it. It isn't long before he realizes he is stuck alone with a mad women. Soon after she finds that he killed off her favorite character. So she has him burn his manuscript to his newest book. Then has him start writing a new book bringing back the character she loved.There's no phones in the house and she never contacted the police like she claims. So he's stuck there with no one even knowing but her. He needs to find a way out but he can't use his legs and she barely ever lets him out of her sight.<br /><br />  James Caan and Kathy Bates are fantastic when they carry most of the movie by themselves. Kathy Bates is creepy but she even makes you like her at times while being afraid at the same time. Caan wasn't originally casted for the role but is hard to picture anyone else. Kathy Bates nails her part though and is no wonder she won best actress. Caan probably should've been nominated too though. Rob Reiner, who directed should do another King movie.  I mean this is one of the best king adaptions.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was quite impressed by this movie! Sure, it does take away some of the dramatics of the stage... but I enjoyed it for what it was.    Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford would have been great, but I like Emmy and Gerard too. Original London Cast or the film cast, I like both of them.    Emmy Rossum is quite an actress and singer! She isn't as operatic as Sarah Brightman, but what a voice! So strong, clear, and crystalline, and an impressive range! And at her age? This young lady is going to go quite a distance! I'm impressed that she'd never seen the play before and that she's nailed this role dead-on.    Gerard Butler...! He just stole the show for me! His dusky singing voice is actually quite lovely concidering that he's not this highly-trained vocal acrobat. Michael Crawford has a lovely tenor, but it seems lightweight, and not rich and full enough to pull off Erik's role, in my opinion.     Gerard actually hits those high notes quite well. He's able to go into the tenor range for more intimate, romantic moments, and into the baritone for the highly dramatic ones. He has gotten some criticism for being too young and handsome (and cute) for Erik, but I don't care about that. He has Erik's strong, mysterious, tempramental, and *very* sensual nature! And he's totally sympathetic and poignant as Erik, especially after \\"All I Ask of You\\" and at the grand finale. I just wanted to hold him at such moments. Obvious stalking put aside, I just can't see why Christine chose Raoul over Erik.    Patrick Wilson's Raoul is handsome and has a lovely voice, and he has more backbone than in the play... but I still don't care for Raoul, mainly that he took Christine away from Erik when he could have gotten any mademoiselle.    Minnie Driver is a wonderfully obnoxious but funny Carlotta! Margaret Preese(I think that's her name) did a wonderful job lending her singing to Minnie's Calotta. Minnie's actual singing voice in \\"Learn To Be Lonely\\" is very unique. Beautiful and really haunting.    Miranda Richardson was wonderful as the brooding Madame Giry. Dramatic and intense from her appearance to her voice. And Jennifer Ellison sure is a gutsy Meg!    This production was truly stunning! I cannot wait until it's released!
0812550706|5.0|I'm not the kind of person to whip out a science fiction story and get all excited over it. So when my english 2 teacher took it out I thought \\"great, science fiction, I can't stay awake during Star Wars let alone read some space book.\\" I'm more of a fantasy type person, like magic and stuff. But with \\"Ender's Game\\", I became immediately interested. I truly enjoyed this book. It's highly recommended. There's so much description and you can feel the emotion behind the words. It's a story of a boy being trained to be a killer in space, a boy having to grow up way before he's supposed to. Ender is a character we can all realate to which makes this book great for children and adults.
0743454529|1.0|This is my first and last novel by this author.  There is no surprise ending to my review:  I intensely disliked this novel.  A friend suggested I read it, and because the subject matter - which if memory serves me correctly actually happened several years ago - was interesting and totally plausible, I decided to read the book with much anticipation.  Unfortunately, for me this novel was a huge disappointment and waste of time.  With a different author, this might have been a great novel.  Instead, the book was poorly written, and much of the storyline was completely unbelievable.  I could sit here all day and point out the book's flaws, but many of them have already been discussed elsewhere by other readers.  In my mind, there could not have been a neat and happy ending to the story, but this particular ending didn't even make sense.  I had been prepared for a \\"surprise\\" ending, but at the very least I expected an ending that would make sense in the context of the whole story.  However, my expectations were too high.  My advice is to skip this book altogether, and rent a good DVD.  The Doctor, by director Randa Haines, is one that comes to mind.
B00005JNRB|5.0|This movie was obviously meant to be taken lightly and enjoyed, and enjoyable it is!   <br /> <br />There were quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, plenty of blow-em-up adventure, and most refreshingly, no gratuitous sex or foul language or gore... <br /> <br />Who has to have a strong storyline to be entertained? It isn't \\"Roots\\"...  it's a fun movie that you wouldn't be embarrassed taking anyone to see.   <br /> <br />Go with that in mind, and you won't regret the admission price.  I'll also get the DVD when available, it's a keeper! :)  Well done!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This is THE Blondie \\"Greatest Hits\\" package to own.  Their previous hits package that has been out since it was originally issued on vinyl back in the early 80's did not include some of their lesser hits, nor did it include some of their hits after it was originally released.  This CD includes 2 key tracks from \\"Eat to the Beat\\" that were left off of \\"Best of Blondie\\": \\"The Hardest Part\\" which peaked at #84 on Billboard's Hot 100 and \\"Union City Blue\\" which did not chart but received airplay.  The CD also includes 2 songs that were released after \\"Best of Blondie\\" was released: \\"Island of Lost Souls\\" from \\"The Hunter\\" which peaked at #37 on the Hot 100 and \\"Maria\\" from \\"No Exit\\"  which peaked at #82 on the Hot 100.  I am sure some people will complain that other essential Blondie tracks were not included, but all of the chart hits are here, except since this was released the band put out another album (\\"The Curse of Blondie\\") with a minor hit, \\"Good Boys\\".  Do like I did and download \\"Good Boys\\" and you will have all of the essential Blondie tracks. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B0002XL35G|5.0|I just want to be honest with what I've saw, the picture is excellent, the soundtrack is great, the slide guitar fits so well in every scene, the actors did a superb job and what else can I say, I haven't seen a movie yet this good and has an excellent cinematography. The long conversation between Travis(Stanton) and Jane(Kinski)is difinitely the best and very memorable that until now, no matter where I go it lingers on my mind just that scene alone, its very touching that Ive tried so hard not to cry, but tears just roll down, kinski's role here is short but it seems to me that her presence seems to be in the whole movie. Its difinitely the best road movie ever, that I was so surprise that it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar but thank God it won the grand prize in the Cannes Film Festival coz it deserves more than that.

B00005AWMF|5.0|neo-soul is kinda like this chic urban soul type music.its retro yet modern in sound.but sade isn't really neo-soul she's not even fully R&B.she's more of a fusion of smooth jazz,R&B,and island rythems and a small touch of rock.if you want neo-soul try angie stone,anthony hamilton,or d'angelo.<br /><br />sade is kinda in the catogory of being a cult chic artist within the urban music scene along with other artists like dionne farris,lenny kravits and living color.she's liked and recognize within the urban demographic but not liked enough to be mentioned in the same sentence as anita baker or to a lesser exstent whitney houston.in other words she only have cult status in the urban demographic(a large cult status none the less).besides she does get played on adult contemperary R&B stations,that play old,and new school R&B. so she's not totally beyond urban listeners ears.either way she's been sampled by rappers,and covered by rockers.so she's more or less popular<br /><br />on to the review<br /><br />this album would have been perfect if feel no pain was on here.but all 16 tracks are hauntingly beautifull paradise,sweetest taboo,and never as good as the first time,has this nice midtempo island beat to it.cherish the day and no ordinary love are great hauntingly beautifull ballads.<br /><br />your love is king,and is it a crime has a nice jazz lounge vibe to it.<br /><br />over all this cd is a must for any type of late night erotic encounters.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|<br /> Ok, I am writing from Bangalore in India, bought the CD for  <br /> 400/- Rs Only. Which is about 9 and odd dollars. I did not  <br /> get the DVD with this purchase. I think the album does pretty <br /> well though not spectacular. <br /> The best tracks in priority order are : <br /> 1. Hell Rider <br /> 2. Judas is Rising <br /> 3. Angel <br /> 4. Deal with the devil. <br />  <br />  They are old- Judas Priest, the band members are over 55  <br /> I think. Robert Halford sounds good but not as good as before. <br /> Regards,                                           Lakshman.
0060555661|5.0|The original text by Mr. Graham is very interseting and insightful but the commentary by Mr. Zweig really helps make this a very useful tool. From a psychological perspective this is a great way to perform a reality check on your expectations!
B000021Y77|5.0|I just watched this movie for a History of Cinema class, and I must say that it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. Don't let the fact that it is a German movie throw you off; this is brilliant movie making to the extreme! A pulsating, non-stop action thriller, you will NEVER want this movie to end.  <br /> <br />Run Lola Run is an great example of the New Wave style of movie making; but while this movie is cinematically innovative, it's also incredible for its message: We are all just pawns in the game of life. The slightest, smallest thing can change the path of our lives completely; and this movie shows this message perfectly. Any fan of action films must watch this movie! And if you are thrown off by the fact that it's a foreign movie, the DVD also offers an option of English dubbing. The dubbing is hardly noticible after a while, and the action more than makes up for it. I must also say the the amazing techno music accompanies the action supurbly. Everything is edited around the music, and the results are awesome.  <br /> <br />Some of you may recognize the actress who plays Lola from the Bourne movies. She was amazing in those movies, but she is at her best here. She perfectly mixes action and drama, and is often very humerous as well. She helps to make this movie the great cinematic masterpiece that it is. <br /> <br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you watch this movie. It is a terrific film, and you will be rivited from beginning to end. OVERALL RATING: 10/10
0385338082|5.0|Can You Keep a Secret is one of the most hilarious books I've ever read! The premise is fantastic- who doesn't have a secret? Who hasn't been tempted to just reveal all, especially to a stranger on the plane whom you'll never see again? Emma does just that when she thinks she's going to die on a bumpy plane ride- only to go to work the following Monday and find out that that \\"stranger\\" is the CEO of her company! Luckily (or perhaps unluckily for Emma) her boss has a sense of humor- making for side-splittingly funny encounters. The romance in the book is cute, too- not saccharine sweet, but endearingly sweet. Kinsella managed to think of a funny premise and then follow-through with an entertaining book. This one surpasses all the other chick lit books, in my opinion. Pick it up- you won't be disappointed.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The music of this album is fantastic. The vocals are the cleanest and clearest I have heard is such a long time.  There is something about listening to every one of these ladies that reassures me God is smiling indeed.  This is a MUST have for music lovers.

All I hear from my friend is that this album is so great and that it is so different. It sounds to me like they are trying to HARD to be DIFFERENT. I dont even care that they wear masks their music sucks a**, and have you seen corey w/o the mask please keep it on.  <br />
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I'm keen to see this film, so rather than wait on Amazon I purchased it from the local WalMart. Fortunately for me, I browsed the Amazon reviews before I actually cracked the packaging! <br /> <br />I saved myself money, spared myself the disappointment and got a refund before I got to actually 'enjoy' the subtitling debacle for myself, because that would have driven me nuts. Thanks to those who reviewed it, and gave the rest of us some advance warning...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie made me laugh...alot!  I honestly haven't laughed as much as I did after watching \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" since I saw \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\"  It is pure genius.    I would describe it like this:  Is is a clean, movie version of Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"  Or if thats not your cup of tea, it is a non-Christian, teenage version of Percy's \\"The Moviegoer.\\"    My point is that this is a movie of disjointed scenes that simply explores the life of a socially inept mid-western teenage boy.  It is shot beautifully and the actors do a great job.  They all play their stereotypical roles wonderfully.    If you are bored and want something to make you laugh, buy or rent this movie today!
0143034901|5.0|This intriguing book tells the story of Daniel, who is the son of an antique bookseller. Daniel is taken by his father to the \\"Cemetery of Lost Books\\" and allowed to pick out one book that calls to him. He picks out \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", and soon begins unraveling the mystery of it's author, Julian Carax. I loved this book, and the way the story unfolded. The whole \\"story within a story\\" thing reminded me somewhat of A.S.Byatt's novel, Possession. It also has the same gothic feel to it that Possession does. A wonderful book and I highly recommend it.
B00007JMCX|1.0|A movie is supposed to entertain, and enlighten, not confuse.  Maddeningly incoherent plot, quirky and annoying camera work, terrible acting, especially by Candy Clark in bad adapation of her American Graffiti role - if she said, \\"Tommy, Tommy!\\" one more time, I was going to scream!  The director should have been taken out back and shot!  Could have been a good film if the story was simply told!
B0007LCNKM|4.0|I guess it's the nature of Americana -the most puzzling new genre label since \\"New Age\\"!- to find its worshippers in the most unlikely places, whether it's a borough of New York -having relocated from Cincinatti- or Leeds in the UK when it comes to Dakota Suite, or even somewhere Norway in the case of Midnight Choir.<br />Anyway the international references above are not gratutious or forced to make my point, The National ultimately belongs to the same community of voices as the above mentioned bands. Like its peers in Europe, they are keen on emotive ballads that manage to evoke and make sense of the pains of being alive.<br />Where The National does distinguish itself is in their ability to sound as convincing when it comes to the a louder and more epic songcraft, as they do with the intimate stuff. And, in this album, The National proves their range, whether it is the tender melody of \\"Daughters of the Soho Riots\\" or the building passion of \\"Looking For  Astronauts.\\"<br />Other reviews have already mentioned influences and similarities. Certainly the singer will remind you of Stuart Staples of the Tindersticks, although the references to Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen -both of whom I know and admire- are less obvious to me. Actually, at least when it comes to two of my favorite songs -the brooding \\"Val Jester\\" and the gorgeous \\"All The Wine\\"- Matt Berninger's voice evoked the tone and phrasing of Robert Fisher from the great Willard Grant Conspiracy.<br />That said, and more importantly, these guys have their own things to say musically and lyrically, and the names mentioned should only be taken to give new listeners a sense of reference, but not to imply that The National's music owes anyone a major debt. They stand on their own, and they deliver a beautiful, heartfelt album, whether they rock or they long, when they turn the volume up and when they lower the lights.<br />If you were impressed by last year's EP -Cherry Tree- this full-length gem will fill you with joy.

B00008J4P5|5.0|This is the most original new band to come out and in my opinion the best. The reason Jack White is a genius is not that he is one of the greatest guitarists ever but in a similar way to Kurt Cobain. Not the best voice, not the best guitar, but there's something that sets them totally apart from everyone else. There's not denying it when you see them and hear them. They justify there hype by having success after success. And this album is proof.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|As SAW opens, two men awaken to find themselves chained in a filthy industrial bathroom without any memory of how they got there.  One is given the instruction that by a certain time, he must kill the other man or his family will die instead. <br /> <br />We soon discover that the scenario is the work of a serial killer known as `Jigsaw,' whose M.O. is to place people in sadistic set pieces from which escape is possible, but at great cost.  Like the killer in SEVEN, Jigsaw is trying to teach a lesson.  He targets individuals who don't seem to appreciate their lives.  But unlike `John Doe's victims, Jigsaw's have a way out available to them, horrific though it might be.  The sole survivor of his traps emerges a changed woman and claims \\"he helped me.\\"  This is an interesting point that I wish had been given more attention. <br /> <br />SAW is a gripping, suspenseful and unpredictable thriller while it's running.  It wasn't until I thought about it afterward that I realized it just didn't make sense.  The plot of the film - at best - relies on the remotest of coincidence to play out, while many of its elements don't work altogether.  In the manner of Dario Argento, the filmmakers went for style and effect rather than logic.  I'm willing to overlook it in this case because I was thoroughly entertained for the duration. <br /> <br />For the benefit of the timid, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the film is not as grisly as its subject matter and promotional imagery would suggest. <br /> <br />The DVD of SAW includes commentary by director James Wan and writer/actor Leigh Wannell.  It is fairly interesting and often funny.  There are two music videos for Fear Factory's \\"Bite the Hand That Bleeds You\\" - one rated and one unrated.  The rated one is actually better.  The unrated video requires the band and a model to act (badly) while singing the song and is kind of embarassing.  There is a \\"making of\\" featurette for the unrated video, as well as a very brief one for thefilm itself.  Finally, there are trailers and poster art.
B000001EL7|3.0|As I read over the dozens of reviews, I get the feeling that the majority of you feel that KISS could/can do no wrong, especially for those of you who live outside the USA.  I got this album for my 8th birthday, and I think I even had the lunchbox too.  At the time, KISS was everything to us fans.  It was a world/language unto itself.  Everything released by KISS was cool, no matter how ridiculous or absurd it seemed to adults.  Now that I am an adult, I still like certain songs, but I now see through the veneer that was (and is) largely a money making venture/collective Paul and Gene ego trip.  Yes, they had some killing rock songs.  'Love Gun' has a couple-notably 'I Stole Your Love', the title track, 'Plaster Caster' (the album's MOST underrated song), and, of course, 'Shock Me'.  But each album, particularly after the success of 'Alive!', reached lower and lower.  Lyrics got dumber, costumes got more ridiculous, and the musical vibe got poppier and poppier.  But what was really happening here was that KISS was becoming incorporated.  Though they would expand and expand as the decades came and went, finding new ways (and new things) to sell {the first 5 years of the band} would take precedent over everything else.  Even now, in 2005, Gene Simmons is the headpiece of a staff that markets the original band in nearly every way possible, and Ace and Peter don't get a dime of it, and haven't for quite a long time.  'Love Gun' was really the beginning of making KISS overly accessible to anyone with money, particularly to those too young to know better.  Once upon a time, KISS was indeed something special.  1977 was actually the year that Gene and Paul decided that the band would have more life as a marketed product than as a musical entity.
B00000JCOV|2.0|Slipknot's self titled CD gets 2 stars for one reason and one reason only, and that is that although it is absoultly horrible and the fact that people have called it death metal is an utter disgrace the fact is that bands like Slipknot are perhaps paving the way for good metal to make its way into the mainstream.  Now, with that out of the way lets review this utter disgrace to music. <br /> <br />Slipknot has nine members.  Why?  I have no clue.  Listen, if you can't make quality music without the aid of a turntable and 2 extra \\"drummers\\" you shouldn't be making music.  Peroid.  It doesn't make your band special if you throw extra members in there and then try to pretend it makes you unique.  No, it makes your sound sloppy. <br /> <br />One word can be used to discribe this CD, and that word is cluttered.  This CD pretends to be heavy by making as much noise as humanly possible.  Little tip for the future, anyone with even MINIMAL knowledge of music knows that slipknot isn't heavy or aggressive, it's just the same \\"in YO face\\" mentality that has been associated with metal, thanks to bands like Slipknot and Korn.   <br /> <br />I'd try to cite examples of how their instrumental ability is bland and boring, however the truth is I can barely discern things from one another in this CD.  Truthfully, I can't really tell when there is two guitarsts and when there is one.  I can't hear the bass hardly ever, and with all the random percussion going on, I can't tell what's a drum set, and whats a trash can being banged on.  <br /> <br />This CD gets a 12%.  If you want something heavy listen to Deicide's Legion, Vital Remains Dechristianize, Cannibal Corpse's Tomb of the Mutilated.  Listen to anything better than this vapid garbage.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Not being a fan of all these new american metal bands  and specialy hating killswitch engage, shadowsfall, unearth all that metalcore and mallcore crap... I will set the guys from lamb of god aside from that crow because i feel that as a deathmetal fan? These guys got what it takes to make a indecrible work of art...Truly amazing. I mean, even if you dont like metalcore or the new american metal bands lately? Give these bands a chance between the buried and me, the redchord,dead to fall,pow, and of course lamb of god and make sure if you already haven't ? Buy lamb of god's  \\"ashes of the wake\\" and for some one who does not like hardcore music that should give an idea of how great these guys are and you won't be letdown and make sure  you catch lamb of god live! \m/
B0007O38F8|3.0|What is rap coming to? The massacre is really a 2.5(stars) but i'm such a nice guy i gave it 3 instead of 2. but really rap has come to a point where there's almost nothing to really look forward to. There are about 5 or 6 songs that are even worth being released. \\"Im supposed to die tonight\\" and \\"position of Power\\" are good, they actually sound like \\"Get rich or die tryin\\" material. Candy shop and Disco inferno are what they are hot singles(i guess u can add So amazing, its another single type but its just ok). Hate it or love it and God gave me style are good too and they show another side of 50 instead of the all to familiar \\"I got shot 9 times\\" b.s. Piggy bank is funny but is the weakest diss track I ever heard. Most of the album sounds lazy and like he's on medication <br /> <br />Go get Beanie Sigel's the B-Coming or even Will Smith's \\"Lost and Found\\"(I've good things about it)
B000002L68|5.0|I also fell in love with this album.  I bought it the day after seeing the film, and becoming a non virgin!! at the same time - mainly due to the emotions bought about by watching it.  I was 15 at the time and had never felt it worth bying a LP with my 4 weekly pocket money at the time, but I did this time.   <br /> <br />Now in my mid 30's I can honestly say it is still my favourite album, but I've only recently managed to work out what the lyrics are at the end of Darling Nikki (despite trying many times on my record player before getting a bolloking from my dad for abusing the player.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this band. Enough said. Amy Lee's voice can penetrate your soul and make you weep. This band is famous because of their sound but people should really listen in onto the lyrics as well and hear exactly what Lee is singing about because then the songs will really be powerful. I like this band's difference, and I also do like their sound and their in- depth lyrics. I love songs that sing out like on Fallen and if I could ever meet Amy Lee I would hug her because it feels great to know others feel as you do in life and have the courage to sing out about it. As I said: Love the band. Period.  <br />The songs on Fallen that get straight As are Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Everybody's Fool, My Immortal, Tourniquet, Hello, and Whisper. But this entire c.d. is worth listening to. This is one of my favorite c.d.s and always will be in my music rack.
B000000OQF|5.0|In 1987, I was an awkward teen trying to be different from the masses in my oh so average high school full of jocks, nerds, misfits and headbangers.  I always dreamed about living in LA where freestyle BMX reigned, snowboarding was emerging and Life's a Beach clothing flowed freely.  So even though I was stuck in Boston, everything I liked was SoCal...and when I got my hands on some metal mag talking about some upcoming band name Guns N' Roses who had the baddest attitude, I knew I had to hear the album.  There was Axl all glammed out with big hairspray, mirrored sunglasses and black leather pants etched \\"Glam Sucks\\" on his thigh. He looked cool and dangerous.  Good enough. <br /> <br />Well a dozen record stores later in the summer of 1987...there was nothing on the shelves...until one day in August a single cassette of Appetite for Destruction was found.  I bought it, got home and on comes Welcome to the Jungle.  It blew my mind..so much so that I played it like 5 times in a row before I even got to the other songs.  I think for 6 months, that was the only album I kept in my cassette deck.  As I learned to listen to the other tracks, I would come to school preaching the sound of a new band out of LA that would define my music.  I wanted a GNR t-shirt to wear proudly then and there, but it would take a few months before Welcome to the Jungle would make its fiery debut.  Then came Sweet Child...and a hard rocking monster band was born on an album that time would later tell to be a classic, that far outlives the legacy it's authors have, or will ever, achieve. <br /> <br />The core tracks of AFD are Jungle, Paradise City and Sweet Child because those were the big MTV releases.  All three songs are defined by their immense openings...preludes to the tracks that combine an incredible hard rocking beat mated to the timely screams and vocals of Axl.  However, true fans of the album know the remaing songs are giants in their own accord.  It's so Easy and Out to Get Me, though musically very different in tone, evoke the same raw hardcore image of the LA club scene of fast times, fast girls and fast living.  Brownstone is probably my favorite track on AFD as Axl goes into deep vocals and the combination of the bass beat with Slash's lead combine for a true classic.  Side A of AFD is one of the strongest set lists I have ever heard.   <br /> <br />Side B is less powerful, because it is handicapped by 2 throwaway songs...Think About You and Anything Goes (this is an AWESOME song in it's original form if you can find it bootlegged).  My Michele and You're Crazy are hard hitting songs that are solid contributors, but to my ears, not nearly musical enough to anything on Side A.  However what makes up for Side B is Sweet Child and Rocket Queen. These are two long songs that combine unprecedented music harmony with hard rock.  They are that good...and elevate AFD, as an album, to another level. <br /> <br />~20 years later, I do not play this album that much any more because it is an andrenaline pumping machine moreso than background after-dinner music.  However it is, and will always be, my first album choice in picking one to add to any collection.
B000050XEI|5.0|From the grand country of Scotland comes an artist of great talents.  The remarkable and soothing voice of the famous Enya sets the mood for relaxation.  The melodious harmonies from her music has given her loyal fans a sense of peace and serenity.  Enya, with a sense of flow in her music, has a unique style like no other.  Each of her songs have movement.  Also, in most of her songs, Enya sings in one key tone, but then shifts to another tone at any point in the song.  From her album \\"A Day Without Rain\\", the track \\"Only Time\\" is a perfect example of this feature.  <br />  <br /> The album \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is worth buying in order to experience the Celtic styles of Enya.  Enya's ever popular song \\"Only Time\\" contains music with such tranquility and composure.  It also has soft tones that can help unwind the daily stress we all seem to experience.  Another song from this album, \\"Flora's Secret\\", is another song with much sweetness.  It is a very happy and cheery song with much joy and excitement.   <br /> <br /> The title track \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is a very powerful and melodious song that is a part of Enya's album.  Although Enya does not sing in this song, it still has the same distinct style that is being carried in her songs.  Another song, \\"Lazy Days\\", is another song with a rhythm added to it.  There is the same style of different tones used in the song.  Each of Enya's songs has a different harmony that greatly influences and creates the sense of placidity. <br /> <br /> Enya's music seems to be very healthy and good for the soul because it doesn't contain harsh tones or inappropriate language that can send a negative message.  It is her lyrics and styles of music that make her songs so beautiful, elegant, and apposite for listeners to hear.  In fact, Enya's music is suitable for all ages, young and old.  Her songs are traditional, fairytale-like songs, each telling a different story.  Enya's music is awe-inspiring and sends a positive message to her fans. <br /> <br /> The artist from Scotland has so much to offer.  Enya has accomplished to create songs of such significance and meaning.  They bring pleasure and a sense of peace.  Also, Enya's music is very appropriate for all ages and is good to listen to anytime of the day.  Let Enya's harmonies fill your heart with joy, peace, and tranquility through her album \\"A Day Without Rain\\".
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens are an interesting band because they don't really follow trend or date, they just try to write stuff that they think is cool. Well, I think it's cool too. This album is their masterpiece to date. Great songs, tight dirty sound, and stellar performances by all involved. Josh Homme is very apt at putting together great musicians who can really create a chemistry. Lanegan sounds awesome and really adds a nice color to the songs he's on. 'Former' bass player Nick Oliveri is rabid and screaming his own sonic contributions and cooler than ever. <br /> <br />As for their drummer on this album, the 'Too Damn Talented For His Own Good' Dave Grohl, well let's just say that his drumming on this record is just plain perfectly sick. Tight, energetic, tasteful and always adding to the songs. It's guys like Grohl that make musicians like me pissed off. In a good way though. <br /> <br />If you like original, guitar heavy, atmospheric rock then look no further. As far as I'm concerned this is the best rock album put out in the last 5-10 years. Yeah, it's that good.
B000000WA4|5.0|all i have to say is this album is amazing in every aspect, both musically and lyrically.  In my opinion, Thru The Eyes of Ruby is the best song ever written, with amazing lyrics and unforgettable guitar.  This song has so many great points, and is both soft and rocks out.  They last 30 seconds of the song is beautiful. Some other favorites are tonight tonight, jelly belly, here is no why, muzzle, thirty three, and 1979.  This is an epic album and contains a legendary mix of music.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Forget Brothers In Arms. Throw it away. This red sleeve houses the most important and satisfying 37 minutes Mark Knopfler has committed to record. From the open chords of Tunnel of Love to the camp closing of Les Boys, in between lies so much tasty guitarwork, memorable tunes, and heart tearing lyrics, that you cannot fail to be moved by the music herewith. <br /> <br />Dont believe what you read about this record being \\"American\\". It may have been recorded at The Record Plant, but its roots are in North East England (Newcastle, Knopfler's home town). He even namechecks The Spanish City, a fairground of his youth in the seaside town of Whitley Bay. Yes, Roy Bittain is there, and the record is exponentially better for it. His soul filled ivorywork during the 3-minute coda on the title track is worthy of a song in itself, and has been nominated by dozens of axemen, filmakers, and fans alike as the reason they worship at the temple of Knopfler. Listen harder, and you can hear it across all the tracks, a masterful counterpoint to the guitar symphonies taking centre stage. <br /> <br />Listen to the steel string tears of Romeo & Juliet - has a man ever been able to put this much emotion about a break up into a song before or since? <br /> <br />Or sit between your speakers and marvel at the duel between two lead guitars in the core of Expresso Love, each slightly differently tuned, so that a single guitar seperates into two tunes, counterpointing each other. <br /> <br />1980, and with two albums under their belt, Dire Straits went into the studio with reduced expectations, and less pressure. The result is a piece of work, that 25 years later still stands the test of time.  Mark Knopfler would go on to record other great material (Telegraph Road, of Love Over Gold; You And Your Friend, from On Every Street; What It Is, and the title track to Sailing to Philadelphia) but never would he plug his guitar and his heart in with the same intensity as he did for Making Movies. Owning this album is not an option. It should be mandatory.
B000002LOE|4.0|I would recommend that if you are new to REM, you should get this cd (unless you want their best of cd).  If you want to collect the albums like I am, then this cd is completely worthwhile, and has a big hit of theirs called \\"losing my religion.\\"  the whole cd is very upbeat, and sometimes a little too peppy, and it alternates between slightly slower and faster paced folky college rock, but accessible enough for the mainstream.  REM go a lot deeper than this, especially on Document and Automatic for the People, but this cd is a good introduction and a fun cd of theirs to listen to.  I recommend it very much, unless you don't want to get all of their albums and want the best of cd instead, which is good too.
B0000062FN|5.0|Excelente disco!!! Es una verdadera maravilla, no cabe duda que esta primera banda de SANTANA quiz fue la mejor, tiene una excelente seccin de percusiones a cargo de Mike Carabello, Jos Chepito reas y el maestro Mike Shrieve en la batera; la meastra de Gregg Rolie en los teclados junto con su voz. El disco abre con Batuka, en donde se nota un duelo de guitarras de SANTANA y Neil Schon, para seguir con No to depend on que es un clsico de todos los tiempos. Taboo es otro corte de maravilla con la voz de Gregg Rolie y una excelente guitarra de SANTANA,y la seccin de percusin es fabulosa, esta cancin son de esas que no son muy conocidas, pero son un tesoro escondido.Toussaint L'Overture es otra de esas clsicas del disco.En cuanto al lado dos del disco sin palabras, todo excelente; con Guajira es otro corte que pone en alto a la msica latna en todo el mundo, Jungle Strut aaaahhhhh fabulosas percusiones, que en el disco lo dejan a uno boquiabierto, esa sincrinizacin de estos msicos es perfecta. Los cortes en vivo en el FILLMORE WEST (uno de los templos del rock) son excelentes. Por supuesto que tiene influencias de Miles Davis, John Coltrane y otros maestros, pero tienes el sello de la primera banda de Santana. Si que te la sacaste paisano SANTANA.  Viv Mxico
B0000019PA|5.0|A better album has never been made. In the millions of years to come, it is possible that a better one never will be made either.  This record changes everything.
B00006AW2G|5.0|..for anyone who is even remotely a Stones fan. It is one of the classic hard rock albums of all time. No more need be said.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Some movies are just fluff, while some can change lives. 28 Days falls solidly into the second category, although it is by no means it is a documentary. It is a light Hollywood treatment of a serious topic. You can take the point of view that at least maybe people who ARE addicted will see it without realizing the full import up front, and realize they need help.<br /><br />We begin with Sandra Bullock's character, who is a New York lady living the high life with her boyfriend. After a night of heavy drinking, she wakes up late for her older sister's wedding. She completely destroys the wedding, crashes the wedding limo and ends up in rehab.<br /><br />You get the typical transition from surly, angry newcomer to understanding, coping recovery person - learning more about her past and the characters around her along the way. Situations are extremely two dimensional and oversimplified, but to be fair, the movie only has so many minutes in which to tell the story. There are the traditional set-backs and problems, and small victories.<br /><br />So where is Viggo, the 2nd billing, in all of this? If you're a Viggo fan, you spend about half the movie waiting for him. He eventually shows up as a baseball pitcher tossed into rehab to fix his drugs-and-girls habit. He's got southern charm and a laid back personality, as always. And yes, there are horses. It seems Viggo likes to be in horse-movies. In this case, the horse is one of the key \\"characters\\" - it symbolizes Sandra's ability to finally let things go and trust in life.<br /><br />It's actually suprising that Viggo got second billing here. He doesn't have many lines, and he isn't even a 'romantic partner' for Sandra. In fact he is quite innocent when Sandra's boyfriend accuses Viggo of stepping into the situation.  Viggo does deliver the final message to her as she leaves rehab, though - to learn how to forgive, and to cut her boyfriend loose in order to face a new world alcohol-free. Sure enough, it turns out her boyfriend is trying to drag her right into the same world, and she does better to go it alone.<br /><br />The scenes with Viggo were a little contrived, but they had their own charm. Viggo had his low key country charm, but punched Sandra's boyfriend pretty quickly when things got rough. He showed Sandra how to pitch, and had her throw the ball with her eyes closed, to teach her trust. On the other hand, he was literally caught with his pants down, showing that he hadn't quite given up the sleeping around yet.<br /><br />The only thing missing here in the \\"Viggo Standards\\" was another language - Viggo only gets to speak \\"southern American\\" in this film!<br /><br />Interestingly, this was Viggo's last movie before the Lord of the Rings series. So he went from a very understated role, to one which made him world famous.yfriend is trying to drag her right into the same world, and she does better to go it alone.<br /><br />The scenes with Viggo were a little contrived, but they had their own charm.

068987474X|3.0|I read this book from cover to cover, in about half an hour, and I seriously didn't get a whole lot of information other than a bunch of excuses guys give to avoid a relationship.  <br /> <br />There's nothing in the book about really UNDERSTANDING guys! <br /> <br />That's where the book seriously lacks content! It's a funny read, it gives good examples of guys that are too lame to be real, but the rest is just not there.  <br /> <br />Greg is a fantastic writer as far as humor goes, his style made the book fun to read, but this is really NOT a serious relationship book.  <br /> <br />Basically, if you're getting mixed messages - MOVE ON! That's the message of the book, which is a good one, and that's all the book is about.
B00005JNQ8|3.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" is a fundamentally sound suspense thriller made unconscionably tedious by the imposition of a romantic subplot.  It looks great, sounds great, and when it sticks to the smart-thriller game plan it really works.  Scott Frank's wonderfully old-fashioned sensibilities and Steve Zaillian's epic tone are both evident in the screenplay which does a fine job of making global-historical issues tangible and compelling.  In the best sequences - the opening, the bus, and the high-stakes finale - Pollack's direction is typically strong and assured.  But when the Broome/Keller (Kidman/Penn) relationship strays unnecessarily from stressed-out, suspicious professionals to would-be lovers, you're inevitably reminded you're watching a movie which probably owes too much to nervous executives and low-scoring all-female test screenings.  The apparent willingness of Keller to contemplate bedding Broome when his own dead wife is barely cold is a character curve ball that adds nothing to the story but distaste.  Had the chemistry been left to the performances rather than corny, hamfisted dialogue or, better yet, had the relationship been restricted to the more interesting ground it ultimately regains - two inconsolable people helping each other through grief - then this would have been one of the 5-star movies of the year.  As it stands, \\"The Interpreter\\" ends up being one of those most frustrating cinematic experiences - a very good film that is nonetheless strangely disappointing.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this! It was like watching an action packed 1940s adventure/Sci-fi comic book come to life! The pacing, the story, the acting, the feel and look all nailed down that whole 30s/40s art deco/streamlined futuristic experience. If you have a huge screen and a home theater system this is worth a buy. <br /> <br />The special features were enjoyable too. Just because it was nice to see how this unknown guy and his brother from nowhere was able to make this dream and vision come to life in a big way.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I give Theory of a Deadman - Gasoline two thumbs up.  <br /> <br />PROS: Their follow-up is example of their ability to break the one hit wonders curse that plagues many bands. When I listen to the track \\"No Surprise\\" or \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" by Theory of a Deadman, I feel like this is the caliber of music you should expect to see on a comic book soundtrack like Spiderman 3.  I mention Spiderman because I was first exposed to their singer/guitarist front man, Tyler Connolly, featured with Chad Kroeger (Nickelback) and Josey Scott (Saliva) on the Hero song. I took a chance on Theory of a Deadman's original CD, I was not disappointed. This new batch of songs on the Gasoline CD is a little darker than the first release, but no so that it deters from the sound. It feels like the life on the road has been tough, and the guys,  Tyler Connolly (vocals/guitar), Dean Back (bass), David Brenner (guitar) and Brent Fitz (drums) wrote songs to reflect their travels. I found this one by the band to be enjoyable enough to take a break to write about it. <br /> <br />CONS: No enhancements per say. I would like to have seen a music video or two on the CD, or even better yet release a music DVD featuring live performances and collected music videos released so far. Their tunes are good enough to warrant a DVD release, so that is my only objection. On the flip side of this complaint, you can download some videos such as \\"Nothing Could Come Between Us\\", \\"Make Up Your Mind\\" and \\"No Surprise\\" from their official website. <br /> <br />Theory of a Deadman Gasoline is available in stores now, I would recommend it. This is one of those CD's that will fly under the radar if you are not too careful, and let it pass you by. I enjoyed their first release, and was totally unaware of this one.
B0002BO0HG|4.0|If asked forcefully to imagine the ideal scenario while listening to Antony and the Johnsons eponymous album I'd have to imagine him sitting in a dark Upper East Side loft, hunched over a metallic and broken desk, sipping merlot and smoking packs of American Spirits. An operatic voice, Antony can grab the happiness from your stomach and turn it into reflection of relationship, love and abuse. But the album isn't Music Noir, it has a sense of doves flying out of their cages.  <br /> <br />Like Rufus Wainwright, Antony seems to proudly express his sexual preferences through music and give power to himself by a voice that could shake mountains. An instrument in itself, the chords and levels he reaches bring even the slower songs to a monumental peak and finish. His sound is best displayed in \\"Cripple and the Starfish\\" and \\"Hitler My Heart.\\" The former is a scene about relationship abuse and the strength that Antony might have had to obtain in such a situation. \\"Hitler My Heart\\" might be the effect of such a relationship, trying to express his kindness but having an evil side in his heart he can't let go.  <br /> <br />The album changes on \\"River of Sorrow\\" a title that breads blue and lonely evenings, but reminds that there is promise in the future. \\"Can you see the light/At the end of the dark passageway/Take me with you towards this light/Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river.\\" <br /> <br />Antony's album is much expected lyrically. He steps wayside to Wainwright in song writing, but where Rufus is strong in text Antony is strong in sound. Antony and the Johnsons can lead you through an album with little care to what is being said. A mother's lullaby has little meaning to a child that understands no language, but is relaxing and shows love. Antony accomplishes this feat with great esteem, and shows much promise outside of the realm of popular music.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Robert Johnson apparently was murdered by a Cuckolded husband, who put poison in his whiskey.  Legend has it that the blues singers spent the last minutes of his life on all fours, salivating and barking like a dog.  Whether that story is true, Johnson's post mortem career was every bit as extraordinary.  The then little known singer's disciple include not only such usual suspects as Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, but also later day Punk, Metal and alt Rock stars such as The Red Hit Chili Peppers and the White Stripes. <br /> <br />So there is something potentially exciting in the Master of Blues-Rock guitarist, Eric Clapton, returning to the realms of his youth, and producing and album featuring the songs that have escaped the confines of the Mississippi Delta, and are now an integral part of the global blues/ rock scene.  You'd think Clapton would offer a brand new interpretation to the seminal works of the master, wouldn't you? <br /> <br />Well, you'd be wrong.  Almost everything that's wrong in this album is right there on the cover.  Old, white Clapton in a suit, comfortably seated on his chair, legs crossed, holding an acoustic guitar, ready not so much to rock as to trot.  Johnson's face is in a distant picture on the wall. <br /> <br />Johnson's music is erotic and sensual, vicious and innocent, sacred and dirty and profane all at the same time.  Clapton's renditions turn the urgent songs into middle of the road electric blues, of the kind you can hear in any half decent blues bar.  Johnson had hellhounds on his trails; Clapton's Hounds are as dead as Johnson. <br /> <br />Thus the eroticism and swagger of \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\" (so brilliantly captured in the Rolling Stones' cover) is nowhere to be seen.  Middle Aged Clapton sounds silly when he sings the songs of the youthful, arrogant Johnson.  Coming from Clapton, a line like \\"You can squeeze my lemon 'til the juice run down my leg\\" (from 'Traveling Riverside Blues') sounds downright corny.  The desperate viciousness of 'Me and the Devil', (\\"Me and the Devil were walking side by side/ and I'm gonna beat my woman/ till I get satisfied\\") is all but gone. <br /> <br />Musically, too, the songs are uninspired.  'Kind Hearted Woman' lacks energy entirely, delivered like a standard, never-ending slow blues, B.B. King for the masses.  \\"Rockers\\" like 'If I had Possession over Judgment Day' and 'Last Fair Deal Going Down' are lackluster, lacking any sense of excitement or passion.  Although Clapton's band is well rehearsed and technically competent, you rarely hear a riff or a rhythm that is even slightly surprising.  At best, Most of \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" is competent and by the number, at worst, as in the unfortunate Jazzy rendition of \\"They're Red Hot\\", it's just plain bad. <br /> <br />But every cloud has a silver lining, and here it is \\"Milkcow's calf Blues\\".  Among the least known of Johnson's works, it allows Clapton a strong interpretation, which captured the richness of the song.  Clapton speeds it us, adds distortion to the guitars, groove and panache to the chorus, and delivers with enthusiasm and charm.  It's a classic blues-rock track that is pure revelation: one of the weakest of Johnson's songs emerges as equal to his best.  And whatever has become of Clapton, he still has the genius to let us see it.
B00005JNQ8|3.0|The Interpreter's utopian perspective of the United Nations provided by Sydney Pollock and his crew doesn't pass the laugh test.  Never mentioned is the real one's financial corruption and consistent kowtowing to dictators.  There are even a couple of snide remarks regarding the United States' decision not to fully comply with the UN war criminal courts and how most of the world supposedly (and implicitly with good reason) hates us.  All of the UN officials come across as benevolent and more than willing to bluntly confront national leaders suspected of genocide.  These people are remarkably efficient and relentless in the pursuit of world justice and peace.  Leni Reifenstahl would have been proud. Pollock lacks her genius ability to frame a shot, but he's the late film maker's equal as a propagandist.  This film is pure liberal propaganda.  Of course, what should one expect?  Sean Penn is an unapologetic spokesman for the radical Left.  There's no way that this ideologue would not push his peculiar point of view.  How did the investors get suckered into putting their money into this project?  Couldn't they sense a train wreck in the making?<br /><br />The plot is overly complicated and implausible.  The relationship between Sean Penn as a secret service agent and Nicole Kidman as the UN interpreter seems inauthentic.  Sparks do not fly between these two individuals.  Conservatives will shun The Interpreter, and liberals will feel uncomfortable with the violence. The latter prefer not to know that evil people truly exist. Political moderates will leave the theater bewildered and dissatisfied.  In two weeks, this film will be on its way to the video stores.  Nobody involved in this project will receive an Academy Award nomination.  Some things are best quickly forgotten.  This is definitely the case with The Interpreter.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a movie which is beautiful on all levels. The cinematography is truly astounding, in fact I believe it won an Academy Award. The story is a Depression-era South adaptation of Homer's Odyssey. It is what you would call \\"loosely based\\" on this epic. It is a movie that manages to be funny, odd, and heart-achingly beautiful all at the same time. The 3-stooges dynamic between Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson is excellent. Clooney proves he can do comedy, and I must admit, I was surprised. The music is also excellent; a cross-section of blues, bluegrass, and other old-country styles.
B000089CJI|5.0|Short and simple-- the best indie rock band out today.  If you like these guys, check out Death Cab for Cutie.
B00003CXXS|2.0|I thought this film was just, whats the simple word? Horrible. I mean when I first walked into the movie theatre I was expecting to see a great film considering the first two were amazing though I was skeptical because #1. Steven Spielberg wasn't in the directors chair and #2. John Williams wasn't doing the music and last but certaintly not least, #3. The plot was corny and too simple. A 'married' couple(William H. Macy, Te'a Leoni) invite Dr. Alan Grant(Sam Neill) on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna for there wedding anniversary, at first he says 'No' but when they offer him money he can't refuse. So when they arrive to the island, he finds out the real reason why the couple brought him to the island, to look for there son Erik(Trevor Morgan) who had gone missing eight weeks before while parasailing with his moms boyfriend. It turns out that the 'married' couple actually got a divorce plus they can't give any money to Dr. Grant because they don't have any so basically it was all for nothing. <br /> <br />The reason why this film was in my opinion a total disgrace to the 'Jurassic Park' series is because: <br /> <br />#1. 'Jurassic Park ///' lacks the magic and originality that the first two 'JPs' had. It doesn't have that 'feel' of the first two at all but I guess you would expect that due to Spielberg not being in the directors chair. Now i'm not saying that Joe Johnson did a horrible job, he actually handled the directing better than I thought he would but i'm not saying he did a great job. He did an average job in my opinion.  <br /> <br />#2. The film also lacks the sciency feel that the first two had, instead of focusing more on charector development and the science of the plot the third film focuses more on the action, I think that the director thought that if there was a ton of action then people would love it and not notice that it was missing everything else.  <br /> <br />#3. The great things about the first two films is that you could never tell whether thedinosaurs were CGI or Animatronics because they were both used and blended in so well together. Well in this film thats not the case, you can easily tell when the dinosaurs are CGI or Ani or even a blend of the two, it kind of ruins the movie on its own.  <br /> <br />#4. The look of the dinosaurs, I don't know what they were thinking when they made the Velociraptors. The raptors this time around loose there thrilling and scary appearences and instead look rediculous because of there purple,red and blue color scheme. Plus the film overplayed the 'Raptor Intelligence' a little too much that it soon gets rediculous and impossible to believe. Also, WHAT was wrong with the writers and crew when they decided to kill off the TRex five minutes in when it appeared and bring in the terribly portrayed Spinosaurus?! The way it killed the Rex would almost make you want to vomit seeing as how it would be impossible for the dinosaur to do. I don't know why Horner thinks that the Rex was a scavenger?! <br /> <br />#5. If you want a movie with a great climax then this film is not the one for you, I would instead recommend that you watch either 'Jurassic Park' or 'The Lost World:Jurassic Park' which in my opinion both have some of the most memorable climax's in movie history. Jurassic Park /// doesn't even have whats considered an ending, I can't even explain. <br /> <br />#6. The length of the film. Why is it that JP/// is only around 1 HR and 30 MIN when 'Jurassic Park' is 2 HR and 7 MIN and 'The Lost World' is even longer reaching at 2 HR and 9 MIN? If this film would have been longer than first of all, maybe there would have been a better climax, maybe it would explain more of InGens backstory like part /// was supposed to do and focus more on developing the charectors and inserting more science.  <br /> <br />#7. Theres way too many plot holes left unanswered like the beginning for instance. <br /> <br />Now there are some good things in this film like... <br /> <br />Acting: The acting was very good except for Te'a Leoni, she overacted when it came to the 'being scared' scenes. When I first saw her she wasn't so bad but then when they got to the island her charector just went completly downhill, plus Te'a Leoni screamed too much than what she needed to, theres a scene that made me want to cover my ears. William H. Macy's acting was not near as good as his other films, I think his talent was put to waste in this film but his charector was likable at some times and his acting was averagly good. Sam Neill was the best in this film in my opinion though both him and his charector was wasted I thought his charector wasn't portrayed as good as it was in the first film but it was still good here though and once again Sam Neill's acting is superb. Alessandro Nivola was also good playing Alan's assistant at his dig site, his charector Billy Brennan tags along with Alan on the trip, I thought Alessandro did a pretty decent job and handeled the scenes pretty well. Trevor Morgan was also surpringly good considering he had acted in a Barney film in the past but once I saw one of his previous films 'The Patriot' I was less afraid do to his great performance in that film. Michael Jeter and the other actors did pretty good jobs in this film as well. One of the biggest highlights of the film was Laura Derns 3 minute cameo at the beggining and one minute cameo towards the end, she did a great job as Dr. Ellie Sattler in the first film and I was happy to see she was even slightly involved in this film even though the writers made it to where SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Alan and Ellie are now split up and shes married to some other man which made me mad about the film even more than I already was.  <br /> <br />Overall if you expect this to further the JP series then don't look here but if you just want mindless action filled scenes then I guess watch it. Even though I hated part /// I am still very much looking forward to the upcoming 'Jurassic Park IV' becauseSpielberg is actually choosing the script and everyone working on it look and seem to be very dedicated on making it be as good as the first two especially from the recent news it seems to me that there actually taking there time on the fourth instead of doing a hafe-fast job like on JP///.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Number one, drop any idea that this is a factual account of 9/11.  moore is probably the holder for the most lies told in one film.  If you treat it as a piece of fiction, it is still unviewable.  I kept saying to myself - where on earth did he get his supposed facts?  I gave up and decided that this film should be relegated to the trash heap and never see the light of day in my house.  Words fail me at the disgust I feel for this man and hence the title of my review.  He is not an American, I don't know what he or it is.  I cannot begin to list the outright prevarications in the film.
B000002LEU|5.0|Substance in a single album covers the entire music scene form '77-80 by mixing vim and venom Punk Rock New Wave and experimentations in between.  It is a strange mix of tunes that are exciting and full of that primordial creativity that carries through all of Joy Division's music.   That being said it is a fantastic album and for a band that has only two studio albums this is essential material.  Covering the span of the Pre JD days when the band was known as \\"Warsaw\\" probably very near to the very end though the tunes aren't chronologically arranged it shows the range and development of the band.  This is truly required listing for anyone interested in the development of the `80's music scene as well as old school punk albums.    Opening up with the song \\"Warsaw\\", which has a quintessential punk rock opening, the album starts off very energetically.  \\"The Leaders of Men\\", the next track, is a bit slower and less bombastic and is not among the best.  \\"Digital\\" which follows this one is terrific: it is energy and with great lyrics.  The next song to come is \\"Radio\\" which is fantastic full of energy and upbeat in a very non-JD way but it is very good.  Next comes \\"She's Lost Control\\" which is very dark and has something of an S&M feel to it.  \\"Dead Souls\\" comes next on the playlist and it is a great tune with a long intro but a great tune.  Fans of the Crow will recognize this one through NIN's cover of the song.  The cover is great but this original is better.  The next song worthy of note is \\"Love Will Tear us Apart\\" which seems to be JD's most famous song as it was the one that really broke into the mainstream.  It is very New Wave and is a good song but really not my personal favorite.   The next song I want to mention is \\"Failures of the Modern Man\\" which is a return to the very punk rock influenced early work.  It is really a great one and has one of the most well developed JD guitar solos I can recall.  \\"Glass\\" the next song is really one of my favorites.  With echoing vocals that are at a fevered intonation and biting guitar it really sums up the JD sound.  The last 5 songs really sound have a very common essence and if my beliefs are correct these are probably the beginning of the work that would have filled the third album if Curtis didn't pull the plug. They are interesting in that they show the real musical development of the band.  These song have increased complexity but retain the same feel of the band.  Here we find the real gems of this album.     These brief descriptions really don't do the songs justice and the few that I didn't mention are good too.  This album is really terrific even though it is a mix of different sounds. Seeing as this band has remained so influential putting right next to The Velvet Underground in its influence, it is really an important work.  I recommend this album as highly as possible and for all fans of 80's rock, new wave, goth and emo this band will resonate with you I am sure.  Get this one and I am certain you will agree.

B0007TKNIS|4.0|I have to agree that I LOVED the movie for many many reasons, but the singing was not one of them.  So, for all you who appreciate good music, don't get your hopes up too much.  Here's a breakdown of the voices. <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum- Her voice definitely has POTENTIAL, but it is no where near as polished as it should have been to play the role of Christine.  Yes, I know the character of Christine was young, but she was supposed to have this absolutely AMAZING voice.  Miss Rossum has a nice voice for a teenager, but not incredible.  It was quite breathy in instances as well as pinched and shallow in other areas.  She also wimped out on higher notes...letting her voice go into a shallow bell tone with no presence behind it.  And what is up with the sliding?  Overall, plesant voice but not as high caliber as Christine needed to be. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson- What can I say? I don't think they could have chosen a better voice for Raoul.  Now, his acting wasn't really great, but his voice was breathtaking.  Sure, he had a few notes a bit out of tune and a couple of his vowels were weird, but overall, he had the best musical theater voice in the cast.  Pure tone, consistent vibrato and a pleasure to listen to. <br /> <br />Gerry Butler- Well, Gerry, as beautiful as you are and as wonderful as an actor as you are, you definitely needed a few more years of voice lessons before doing this show.  I think Gerry has potential to become a good singer, but you can tell he just wasn't trained or had very little training.  He didn't quite have the breath support to finish his phrases and the tone was inconsistent.  There was also quite a bit out of tune and very little or no vibrato.  His years of smoking probably have something to do with his breathing and tone, but overall, don't expect too much from his voice.  Just not Phatom caliber.  He is a pleasure to look at though. :) <br /> <br />Carlotta (dubbed voice) - I don't know the name of the soprano who sang Carlotta's role, but DANG...that woman can SING!  Yes it was overly dramatized and a bit piercing at times, but hey, that's her character.  Definitely the most trained singer in the bunch and most consitent.  She could outsing anyone in the cast by far.  You go girl!! <br /> <br />
B000002J1O|5.0|In the 50's jazz realm there wass Miles Davis' Kind of Blue.  Then, in the 60's pop realm came the Beatles Sergeant Pepper.  In the 70's Progressive Rock realm there came Genesis' Selling England by the Pound.  Each timelessly defining their mark in music history.  I bought my first LP copy in the 70s, wore it out and replaced it.  When CD's arrived it was among my first acquisitions.  It's now time to replace the CD and upgrade to the remaster.  A true music lover can't be without this album.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Cate Blanchett should have won the Oscar hands-down! She was absolutely superb in the role as Elizabeth...and her supporting cast was also outstanding!  From start to finish this movie offers it all: a love story, intrigue, murder, mystery, danger and the rise of one of history's most prominent figures!  \\"Elizabeth\\" is an exceptional film...everything was done just so..from the costumes, to the hair, to the scenery...it was all top-notch and gave one a true feeling of the era!  Great, great movie!
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude provides a wonderfully dark, ironic contrast between the angst of growing up and the celebration of growing old and embracing death. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon put in excellent performances.<br /><br />Even if the plot line doesn't appeal to you, the sound track for the movie--exclusively Cat Stevens--is stunning and makes this a must-hear movie.
B000002BE9|5.0|I was first compelled to explore the music of Fiona Apple after hearing the complications her third album \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" has had in getting released, due to her record company's refusal to put it into manufacture because of the lack of any 'radio material'. I for one was disgusted by this, and my disgust was confirmed even more when I finally bought this album. I always kind of knew that buying an album by Miss Apple would be a wise move, but I didn't know just how good...<br /><br />Let's just get a few things straight; this album is absolutely f**king incredible. Nothing less than an alternative female rock masterpiece, and undoubtedly one of the greatest albums I've ever purchased. \\"Tidal\\" is its name, released in July 1996, when Fiona was a mere 19 years old. It was certified Gold in December of the same year, and has currently racked up US sales of 3 million. Apple possesses a raw yet smooth voice, which is rather smoky and jazzy. Her music is primarily rock but boasts hints of jazz and pop. Her songwriting is incredible, totally something else. She's quite the poet.<br /><br />The album opens with the amazing \\"Sleep To Dream.\\" The thumping beat that opens this song soon manifests into a raging and man-hating rock classic! Fiona's vocals here are amazing, and the song has great lyrics. \\"Sullen Girl\\" is one of the most amazing songs on the album. It's such a beautiful and tranquil song. It's a really brilliant break-up song, with visual lyrics such as \\"Calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion.\\" There's some very relaxing sounds swirling around in the background towards the end of this song, making it very memorable and a perfect song to relax to. Fiona is like a mermaid in this deep ocean of a song. \\"Shadowboxer\\" is a real grower, which I didn't really like much to begin with. After a few listens, though, I absolutely love it. This song is so powerful and moving, and it all comes from that amazing voice. Here, Fiona's vocals bellow all over the arrangement which works amazingly with the piano. The song tells the story of a destructive relationship, with almost a hint of physical abuse. This may not be the case, but the ambiguity adds furthermore to its intrigue.<br /><br />\\"Criminal\\" is one of the songs that was released as a single from the album, and perhaps the most well-known. The song is an uptempo rocker with lyrics about how Fiona sees herself as a criminal because she toyed with a boy's emotions. It's a great song and was a huge hit. I love the bridge halfway through the song as Fiona's vocals climb and climb until she's absolutely belting her acid-tongued voice out. Stunning. \\"Slow Like Honey\\" is another beautiful and relaxing song, and the most Jazz-like song on the album. The piano creates this unusual atmosphere in the song as Fiona sings a Joni Mitchell-type classic. This song may take a while to really grab you, but once it does you'll be listening to it on repeat for hours. I just can't describe it anymore, but it's very surreal. \\"The First Taste\\" is the most experimental song on the album, and features a catchy piano riff that kicks in after the unforgettable line, \\"I do not struggle in your web, because it was my aim to get caught. But daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growing weary of waiting to be consumed by you.\\" One of the best parts of the song comes when Fiona sings, \\"Full is not heavy as empty, not nearly my love, not nearly my love, not nearly.\\" Close your eyes at this point and you'll find yourself somewhere totally different. \\"Never Is A Promise\\" is probably the most beautiful song on the album and runs for almost six minutes. It's a slow and moving song that features little snippets that may last only a second or two, but which are so memorable that will be drawn back again and again. The lyrics are amazing, the most noticeable being ones such as \\"I realize what I am now too smart to mention - to you.\\" What I love most about this song is the vocal style Fiona adopts; almost weary, lagging and tired of being hurt. Beautiful and astounding.<br /><br />\\"The Child Is Gone\\" is a mid-tempo number with a swaying piano riff and some unusual lyrics. I'm not quite sure what this song is about, but I do like it. This album has 10 songs of pure genius, and while some are better than others, they're still all pretty damn good. \\"Pale September\\" is one of my favourites due to the amazing piano melody that Fiona incorporates into the song. It almost sounds like a lullaby, but rather ominous too; like something doesn't bode well for the future. The lyrics, however, contrast this; they're absolutely stunning. If you read the lyrics slowly and take in each word while Fiona sings them, you'll be transported - visually - to another place. \\"Carrion\\" is another great song, but probably my least favourite from the album. This is the last track on the album, and it closes the album in fine style. Fiona's vocals are very hushed, almost whispered, which creates an intimate setting between the listener and herself.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Fiona Apple has only had two albums released to date, the aforementioned \\"Tidal\\" and its 1999 follow-up \\"When The Pawn...\\" I bought both albums at the same time, and actually liked the latter much more. Tidal took a while to grow on me, but after repeated listens I can't stop listening to it. It's really impossible for me at this stage to saw which album I like the best - that kind of answer can only be given, at least in my case, in about a year. What this album brings for me is beautiful melodies, gorgeous vocals, thought-provoking lyrics and just something different to my already alternative CD collection. Only ten songs on this album, I hear you cry? Fear not, because in the case of Fiona Apple, less is most definitely more.ed of being hurt.

B00000DGUY|5.0|This album is great but it needs more like Skateaway, Expresso Love, Solid Rock, Telegraph Road, When It Comes to You, The Bug,<BR>&amp; My Parties. But anyway it has most of the songs I like. My favs off this album are Sultans of Swing, Tunnel of Love, So Far<BR>Away, Money for Nothing, &amp; Heavy Fuel. Others I like are Lady Writer, Romeo and Juliet, Twisting by the Pool, Brothers in Arms,<BR>Walk of Life, Calling Elvis, &amp; On Every Street. The weakest song<BR>on this is Private Investigations. Well I hope you buy it because<BR>I am a huge Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler fan. Get it now.
0596007124|5.0|The first Head First book that I bought was Head First Java, which I got from a local store here in Taipei for a good friend of mine who was learning java... but I ended up reading it myself.  I was so impressed with that book, that I have to buy Head First EJB and JSP/Servlet for our department.      Now comes probably the best book of the Head First series (and may I mention the best looking cover of them all).  It makes reading one of the most serious, important and sometimes difficult to understand subjects in the OO universe fun and easy to read. This isn't the first design pattern I read though, and it made me regret the fact that it wasn't.  Maybe the difference between this and any of Mr. Fowler's design patterns books is that this one sits on my cubicle while Fowler's are in my shelf.

B0006IIKS0|5.0|I've never been a big Metallica fan... heavy metal just isn't on the top of my music list, so I was marginally interested in seeing this movie. But, I often find documentaries fascinating, so I watched it.  <br /> <br />I have to confess... I was extremely moved and captivated by what I saw. Actually, I couldnt's stop watching it. It was genuinely inspiring to see these hard-core metal icons being courageous enough to face their demons and show up real, exposing their humanity to the world ~ rather than being content to hide behind their fame.  <br /> <br />Oddly enough, this movie gave me a sense of hope ~ hey, if these spoiled, ego-centric \\"rock stars\\" can evolve and learn from their own human experience how to make peace with each other... maybe there's hope for us as a nation? My personal thanks to Metallica for having what it takes to tell the truth.
B0000009RX|5.0|why is everybody so obsessed with best,gooder,arguably or otherwise when it comes to frank?when this album came out(i had an original issue) it was fun to learn about not taking ourselves so seriously and it got me to listen (again) to the 4 Tops,Little Anthony and the Imperials,Odetta etc. etc etc....as he did in those early days frank hated to play the \\"old stuff\\" and wanted to pull more from his \\"mechanics\\"(his term for musicians)and of course his instruments. <br />the music form this album(cd)is as it should be today,old but still good to listen to.

B00009V8Z9|4.0|I've been fairly disgruntled with music lately, so when I purchased this CD, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. <br /> <br />Imagine my surprise, I haven't taken it out of my CD player since! <br /> <br />I prefer the stripped versions of the songs, but enjoy both versions. Standout tracks for me are \\"Follow Through\\" \\"Chariot\\" \\"Nice to meet you\\" and \\"More than anyone\\" <br /> <br />I really don't care for \\"I don't wanna be\\". Maybe because I've heard it so much on that cheesy teen drama, One Tree Hill, and I've become a little immune to whatever charms that song originally had. No matter, the rest of the disc more than makes up for it. <br /> <br />If you're not into lyrics, not into a pop-bluesy sound, not into piano, you won't be into this disc. But if you do enjoy those things, I think you'll find this a worthy purchase.
B000088E6D|3.0|If you want to hear hits by Lou Rawls, George Michael, Peggy Lee, Queen, and--above all--Frank Sinatra, you may want to seek out those artists' albums. You can't go wrong with Sinatra's versions of \\"Summer Wind\\" and \\"Come Fly With Me\\". Michael Buble's CD is a musical short-cut. Yes, it's a well-paced, enjoyable outing, his phrasing is immaculate and his music choices are 95% right for him(the Queen song can be skipped over), but it's a derivation of the real goods. Not unlike Harry Connick, Jr., although much easier to take, Buble's repertoire will start crying out for some originals soon if this keeps up.
B00005JMX6|4.0|Holy cow!  Elisha Cuthbert is beautiful!  She can act too!  She has a face well suited for acting and she really knows how to use it to convey emotions.  She is a young lady that is not just beautiful on the outside but her inner beauty comes out as well just making her all the more breathtaking!  My fond wish is to see more of her in the movies in the future.  The young lady can act, she's down to earth and is just heartbreakingly beautiful.  I did not expect much from this movie but enjoyed it a lot.
B00005KHEU|4.0|I think it's important to note that, while not a major E.L.O. fan, I really do admire this album. It's a necessary distinction because as the group moved into the featherweight late-'70's, they became a different band than they were at their beginning. Early E.L.O. fans were disgruntled at the time, and they probably still hold a grudge against \\"Discovery\\". On the other hand, a casual listener like myself might really discover something special here that eluded the band's cult. It's a lightweight, slick affair, but on this level it delivers. \\"Shine\\", \\"Confusion\\", \\"Need Her Love\\", \\"Last Train\\", and of course \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" are utterly fabulous. The bonus tracks are wonderful too, and one never tires of the tear in Jeff Lynne's voice(a modern-day Roy Orbison)on the soft songs or his tough, hot growl. He's not an angry performer, and not a trembling, sensitive soul either. So...who or what is Jeff Lynne?? This album isn't telling, but the soulful mystery is danceably provocative.
1593072937|5.0|...or black and white for that matter. The good guys in this book are bad and the bad guys are just plain disgusting! A pill popping murderer(with a soft heart) battles a flesh eating priest and his misunderstood cannibal friend. It just doesn't get any darker than this.<br /><br />Besides the unnaturally sexy women (most of whom are prostitutes), there is nothing attractive about this world that Frank Miller has created. Yet still you will find yourself sucked in by that part of yourself that wants to slow down as you drive by an accident.
B0008JFMEC|5.0|First of all, Amazon's product feedback feature is not the place to praise or berate Sony or UMDs in general. Please stop bringing down the rating of this specific release just because you want to whine about the decisions Sony has made for distributing movies for the PSP. There are plenty of other forums for that. People are coming here to decide whether to purchase this title and couldn't care less about your opinions outside of that.  <br /> <br />After that rant, I'll keep this review short: The video quality is stunning. The soundtrack is clear and crisp (although stereo only). The valuable extras from the DVD are all here (only missing the trailers.. who cares?). This is a solid UMD release. If you can wait, certainly the price will drop, but if you can't $21 isn't unreasonable for what you get here, early adopter.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is the UMD movie to get today.
B00004Z459|5.0|Well, I'll be short. Guys, I'm not gonna waste your time, so...just a few words. The first Linkin Park's LP is something special. Hybrid Theory is one of the CDs that's supposed to be in your collection. Believe it or not - I find it one of the most great albums for last 10 years or something.
0316172324|1.0|Ok! Now I read this book and thought it would be something totally out of this world (considering the buzz about it everywhere and nearly every excutive I meet citing terminology from it), but after reading it, I feel cheated out of the money I spent on it. So what does this book teach you? In one word \\"nothing\\" other than relating a whole spread of stories about people who can take instantaneous decisions. It is very ironical that Gladwell who exhorts to not overanalyse things spends so much time himself on the topic. <br /> <br />Bad read for people who aim to learn things, more suited to people who are accustomed to reading publications that provide more gossip and little useful information. I think folks who shop the HSN will identify very well with the Blink way of decision making.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I took my sister out for her 22nd birthday and \\"Van Helsing\\" was the movie she wanted to see. What resulted were shaking heads, mild chuckles and a whole lot of perspiration. This film was so bad it actually made my feet stink. No, I'm not kidding.     To get down to brass tacks, Stephen Sommers is a hack who means well but never hits the mark. The first \\"Mummy\\" film was adventurous and suspenseful, with some well-balanced humor thrown in, and then people started to do a double take of uncertainty when \\"The Mummy Returns\\" was unleashed. Sommers obviously brushed the flak off his shoulders and wanted to do a film that brought back the campy, exciting appeal of the 30's era of monster classics we have all grown to know and love. People were jazzed that they would finally be seeing Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man and even Mr. Hyde on the same screen. Sommers simply raped this opportunity and utilized each and every single monster in the worst light. Dracula? Nothing more than a snivelling idiot. Frankenstein? A hulking idiot who not only whines incessantly, but also possesses a vast vocabulary and serves as an ally (!) to our \\"heros\\", Van Helsing and the, uh, woman played by Kate Beckinsale. Wolf Man? A badly CGI'd cardboard cutout of a monster that does not exude the tragedy he is famous for.    This was a bad move for Hugh Jackman. Here he is, fresh out of X2, and can't seem to hold his ground without invoking reminders of Wolverine. In fact, Van Helsing's character dangles a hair away from rip-off lane. Van Helsing, like Wolverine, has no past he can remember and is probably immortal. In a scene where I literally exploded with chuckles, Dracula comes VERY close, and I'm not screwing around here, at giving Jackman a line of dialogue that resembles what Brian Cox said to Wolverine in X2, except in a different context.    Kate Beckinsale. Again, this was a bad move on her part. It is as if she walked right off the set of \\"Underworld\\" and filmed this puppy the following week. Starring in two movies that deal with werewolves and vampires is not a good way to play your cards straight.         I know that this was intentionally cheesy, but like \\"Batman and Robin\\", it tries vainly to combine new-age sophistication with cheesiness, and that immediately rules it out as a bad film. When I wasn't angry at this travesty, my laughter was a subtle reassurance. My sister chimed in there was an awful stink near. I don't know if it was my feet or \\"Van Helsing\\". I'm hedging my bets on \\"Van Helsing\\".
B00009L1TA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  A real brain bender!  My only complaint is the separately released soundtrack (or lack there of). The music added alot to this flick, but from all that I've found there was nothing released along with it.  I can't even find the remake of \\"Black Betty\\", only the original.  Anyone have any tips?  Movie is definitely worth your time though!  Rent, buy or borrow today. :)
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Once again Mariah delivers a super duper excellent album, I love the Emancipation of mimi, the sounds, the lyrics and her voice is amazing. My favorite tracks are: \\"stay the night\\", \\"we belong together\\", \\"circles\\", \\"mine again\\", i mean, i love the whole album!!! you should get it and you'll agree with me. Congrats to Mariah for being #1 AGAIN!
0743454529|5.0|This book is very touching and yet very upsetting.  The way each chapter is written from different characters points of views really makes your heart pull one direction then flip-flop the other direction.  I personally liked the ending and for someone who always guesses the ending, I did not see it until I was almost there, which is always a plus.  I did not just shed a few tears, but was actually sobbing (which is very rare for me).  A definite thinker - a \\"what if it were me\\" kind of book.  Definitely worth reading and discussing!
0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath, portray a migrating family that is in search of a better future after they were brutally kicked off their own land by the \\"bank.\\"  The Joads encountered several problems, not only with the conditions of the vehicles and food, but with the people of other regions.  In every region people viewed outsiders as a major threat, and treated them as criminals.<br /><br />Steinbeck took one family and related their circumstances with many.  The journey of pursuing a better future with everything at stake adds a sense of suspense to the overall theme of the novel.He was able to capture the despair of not being able to feed their children or to provide a stable household. The novel keeps the reader intrigued with what is going to happen next, a true classic.
0790731479|5.0|I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmanns and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

B0007GAERG|4.0|The beats within Emancipation of Mimi are typical fare, sonically resembling past Pop and R&B efforts.  The guest appearances are far from phenomenal, and, at times, far removed from the rhymes and flows one would be accostomed to from the respective artists.  Mariah's voice is clear, crisp, dynamic, and utterly beautiful, which is to be expected.  At times, one would quickly recognize a sound reminiscent of prior Carey albums.  Despite all of this clich typicality, Emancipation of Mimi stands out, if not sonically, then emotionally as one of the most powerful Pop/R&B albums to hit shelves. <br /> <br />When I first picked up this album, I wasn't overly impressed.  Usually after a listen or two to any album, I can form a firm opinion of it, first listening casually, then picking up on vocals, background beats, the highs, and the lows.  After five or six listens, beginning to end, I just wasn't impressed.  However, I found myself listening to \\"Get Your Number\\" on repeat, then mixing in \\"We Belong Together,\\" and, in less than a day, I was listening to the album clear through, enjoying every moment.  Pick this album up, and you'll find at least one or two songs you connect with.  Faster than you realize it, you'll be listening to the whole thing over and over.  It's just that good. <br /> <br />The tracks vary from succinct ballads, such as \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Mine Again,\\" where Mariah's voice reaches unbelievable highs and breathtaking lows, to upbeat, empowering staccatos like \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"To The Floor.\\"  Unlike some of the more prominent artists today, Mariah manages to make every song sound different from the previous tune, ensuring that there's at least one or two songs every fan of this genre can connect with.  This sonic variance gives the album a unique flavour, despite it's similarities to everything released prior.  Listen to every song enough times, and the infectious nature of the total product will consume you.  It's really just that good.<br /> <br />I don't know if this signifies a \\"comeback,\\" as Mariah never really went too far since her release of the film Glitter.  However, if the emancipation of her alter-ego has proven anything, she can make a fantastic album that supercedes all of her previous efforts.   <br /> <br />It's really, truely just that good.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Okay, I was not going to add to the already hundreds of reviews out there for this movie, but after reading some of the monstrous reviews here on Amazon, I felt I needed to. Here's the scoop (And my background!): I was an English and Theater minor in college, I read Gaston LaRoux's original book, I saw Lloyd-Webber's musical many times, and I saw several different movie versions (Yes, even the one staring Freddy Kruger as the Phantom!). <br />  People, stop taking this movie so drastically seriously! It is a good movie. Fun to watch; I actually got teary eyed at the poor \\"baby phantom\\" in the circus cage. It is a plain old different story from the stage musical, movies, and book. The original stage version is different from the book: Erik was with his father in the book as a mason building the opera house; in the stage he sings of having a \\"mask\\" as his \\"first unfeeling scrap of clothing.\\"  <br />  Does that make the Musical hideous? Heck no! DRAMATIC license, people! <br />  People are complaining that it is not close enough to the Lloyd Webber stage version. Now, no one is Michael Crawford: he IS the Lloyd Webber version. But Gerry Butler is quite good as a younger, cuter, movie version that they created. I think they KNEW that they would never capture the magic that is on the stage 100% and made the movie a little \\"different\\" in order to make it satisfying. Perhaps the movie is even a bit more true to the Lloyd Webber score? <br />  People also complain that it is not closer to the book. Scarlett in \\"Gone with the Wind\\" had 3 kids, not 1 like the movie. Does that make it any worse? Nonsense! It's an OSCAR winner, for goodness sake.  <br />  So here's the good things that should make you want to see the movie: It is a good story. It is casted well (Especially Emily Rossum who defines the word Ingenue!). The special effects are wonderful. The score is brilliant and beautiful. <br />  So, OPEN your mind to what it it, not what it was, and you will like it! <br />  Thanks for reading.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|... because this is a pretty good record.  <br /> <br />The only thing I knew about LCD Soundsystem was what I read on Amazon. They sounded like my kind of act - any record that can spur comparisons to the Fall, Eno, Can, the Contortions, etc. is something that belongs in my record collection.  <br /> <br />So I bought the disc... and was initially a little let down. On first listen, I realized that I'd heard \\"Daft Punk is Playing at My House\\" before, and didn't particularly like the song (I still don't). The rest of Disc 1 had its highs and lows, but it sounded a lot more disco-house than disco-punk. As a fan of the Rapture, !!!, et. all I was hoping for more guitars-and-electronics mayhem. Disc 1 has since grown on me a little - particularly the bleepy \\"Tribulations\\" and the lush, gorgeous trah \\"Great Release\\" that completes the album.  <br /> <br />The real gem here is Disc 2, a collection of LCD Soundsystem's earlier singles. Basically, it's droning and at times stunning house (with and without vocals) interspersed with some pretty rauchous sludge-punk ... great stuff! This must be where all the Fall comparisons are coming from, because I really didn't hear it much on the first disc. \\"Beat Connection\\" and \\"Yeah\\" are fantastic house tracks. If you just don't like house, it'll sound repetitive and tired. If you DO like house, these two tracks in particular (among others on the record) reach some hypnotic heights.  <br /> <br />The reviews here are pretty funny. On the one hand, this is a good album but it's far from a contender for \\"album of the year.\\" It's probably not even the best example of this kind of music to come out in early 2005. But on the other hand ... what's up with the hipster backlash? It's as if some of these folks aren't content to be cool enough to like LCD Soundsystem - nope, it'd be that much cooler to DISlike them. With all the crap that's all over MTV and the airwaves these days, I don't understand picking on a band that's doing something alittle different. <br /> <br />Fans of the Faint, the Rapture, !!!, and the whole electroclash revival (when did it happen the first time?) will be happy to add this to their record collections.
1582403589|4.0|Writer Robert Kirkman and Artist Tony Moore aren't offering readers anything new or original in their Walking Dead series.  Zombies are just plain popular right now what with films like 28 Days later, the Dawn of the Dead remake, and Romero's new film \\"Land of the Dead\\".  Zombies in many ways represent the ultimate horror as single-minded, almost a hive like existence whose sole purpose is to devour the lving...while they are still living.  That's just a tad more provocative than being bit by Dracula while you're sleeping, I'd say.<br /><br />Kirkman uses Romero's influence as his zombies are slow and shambling as opposed to the jack rabbits of the Dawn remake.  Since you really can't tell any zombie story from the zombie's point of view you naturally can only focus on the survivors and their grasp of the situation.  The story does borrow from 28 Days Later as a cop named Rick Grimes, wakes up in a deserted hospital and very confused.  he meets a couple of other survivors who give him the lowdown on what's happened in the world.  He heads to Atlanta to try to find his family  but instead finds the city overwhelmed by the undead flesh-eaters.  He eventually arrives at a small camp of survivors where he miraculously finds his wife and son.  From there we focus primarily on the relationships of the various survivors.<br /><br />Tony Moore's art is a bit 'cartoony' for my tastes. It's almost like a movie storyboard and I would have liked have seen a more grittier look to it.  Not saying that the art is bad, mind you...he does render some pretty decayed looking zombies.  As a zombie fan I really enjoyed this first trade collection of the comic series.  Kirkman sticks to the core zombie roots and produces a strong storyline.
B0002OERI0|1.0|U call this rock? This is lame. This is crap. The Ramones would lay these guys to rest. This is shameful, mainstream sell-out music. But then again, they were always sell-outs.

B000000ITI|5.0|On the Threshold of a Dream\\" followed \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\". This album has a darker feel to it than \\"The Lost Chord,\\" which periodically became lightly whimsical (\\"Dr. Livingston, I Presume\\" as an example) and was generally upbeat.<br /><br />\\"Threshold\\" begins with a somewhat paranoid interchange between several characters that in a few short sentences explores individuality in modern computerized society. While Graeme Edge is generally upbeat in that he says that as individuals we can \\"...perceive the web they weave and keep on thinking free,\\" the sinister tone of \\"Big Brother's got your number\\" begins the album darkly. A listener will interpret the other songs in the album by this initial tone. Furthermore, the closeout by the last three Mike Pinder selections, \\"Have You Heard\\" parts 1 and 2 and \\"The Voyage,\\" end the album in a melancholy fashion that also reflects on the other tracks, many of which are melancholy themselves.<br /><br />In spite of the dark mood of the album, it is still great for those times when you are a bit moody yourself. For some reason I enjoy listening to this album when it's raining outside, or when I'm feeling down. You would think that the album would drive me further into the depths of depression, but it does not. Instead, it tends to make me think about why I am depressed and ultimately overcoming those issues cheers me up. Okay, it's a little weird, but it works for me.<br /><br />How is the album? This album is excellent. This album was experimental and further associated the Moodies name with progressive rock. The dialogue at the beginning of the album and \\"The Dream\\" by Graeme Edge segueing into \\"Have You Heard Part 1\\", followed by \\"The Voyage\\" which then takes you back to \\"Have You Heard Part 2\\", while being a signature feature of Moodies' albums, was still very new to the world in 1969. While the music is very mellow, it was also in some ways more dreamily psychedelic than \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\". Examples are the aforementioned Mike Pinder selections, \\"Never Comes the Day\\" by Justin Hayward, and \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", an awesome way-too-short song by Justin Hayward and Ray Thomas. This album is great for a bottle of good wine, a dimly lit room, perhaps some black light posters (seriously!), and whatever else you want to add that fits the mood.<br /><br />The lyrics are often cryptic in this album.  For example, just what the heck do the lyrics of \\"Never Comes the Day\\" by Justin Hayward mean? One enjoyable feature of Moodies' lyrics is the point of the lyrics is to be intentionally cryptic. Yes, they meant something to the authors. However, the authors are often vague enough to allow you to interpret them to fit your own life. The Moodies have traditionally been able to make lyrics sufficiently vague that you can easily interpret the lyrics to fit your needs, while making very enjoyable songs that you need not interpret.  I believe this album may have been the best of the classic 7 to achieve both these abilities for a majority of the songs; a very interesting approach that works well for the Moodies.  Others have not been able to create the same kind of lyrics nearly as well or at all.<br /><br />Graeme Edge, as noted above, has two selections on this album. I truly enjoy \\"The Dream\\", which may be Graeme Edge's very best \\"poem monologues\\" on any album by the Moodies. There is a lot of symbolism and blues in this poem that are the perfect lead-in for the three Mike Pinder selections following.<br /><br />Ray Thomas authored \\"Dear Diary\\", \\"Lazy Day\\" and coauthored \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" with Justin Hayward. \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" is by far the best of the three, and I think is the best song on the album. \\"Lazy Day\\" is likely the most whimsical song of this CD, and perhaps the least blue.<br /><br />Mike Pinder, in addition to the last three songs, also penned \\"So Deep Within You,\\" a love song about knowing what is in your lover's heart. This song is very beautiful and easy to understand. Mike's contributions to this album are consistently good and among the best of the album.<br /><br />John Lodge wrote back-to-back love songs: \\"Send Me No Wine\\" and \\"To Share Our Love\\". Both are fast-paced (for this album), and both are good. \\"To Share Our Love\\" is the better of the two, and exploits John's voice well.<br /><br />Justin Hayward, in addition to the excellent \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", also wrote \\"Lovely to See You\\", which is a song of friendship helping alleviate the blues (which you may need after listening to this album!), and \\"Never Comes the Day\\", which I think is a song of love, but it is mixed with other concepts that are difficult to put my finger on. Regardless, it's a good song.<br /><br />If you are a Moodies fan, buy this. If you are not, and want to listen to something different, buy this. Is it dated? This album may be a little dated, but not a lot. The lyrics are about concepts that transcend time. This album is incredibly mellow. It is the third album of the second incarnation of the Moody Blues, and the last album by the Moodies to be this spacey and psychedelic. After this they begin to tackle issues of the environment and how we treat each other and our role in the universe. This album is very unique and should be part of the reason to induct the Moody Blues into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (why they have yet to be I do not have the foggiest clue).

B00001U03Q|5.0|Clapton is simply the greatest guitarist who ever lived. I am 15 year-old guitarist and i have listened to hendrix. i am not impressed by his guitar work like i am by claptons. Claptons guitar work blows my mind every time i turn on one of his cd's. just because this cd does not have some of his more rockin songs (cocaine, shes gone, sunshine of your love, ect...) does not mean it is not a great cd.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|+++++<br /><br />(This review is for the special edition of \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" released in 2003.)<br /><br />This movie attempts to blend the various ancient legends of Robin Hood into a story.  It definitely succeeds magnificently in doing this!<br /><br />Adventure, romance, and spectacle are most apparent in this definitive version of the legend of Robin Hood (Errol Flynn).  Never before has good triumphed over evil with such spectacular color and flamboyance.<br /><br />This movie begins with the printed word serving to orientate the viewer:<br /><br />\\"In the year of Our Lord 1191 when [King] Richard, the Lion-Heart [Ian Hunter], set forth to drive the infidels from the Holy Land, he gave the Regency of his Kingdom to his trusted friend, Longchamps, instead of to his treacherous brother, Prince John [Claude Rains].<br /><br />Bitterly resentful, John hoped for some disaster to befall Richard so that he, with the help of the Norman barons, might seize the throne for himself.  And then on a luckless day for the Saxons [it is announced that King Richard has been captured in his Holy Land battles].<br /><br />The great cold hall of Nottingham Castle, the stronghold of [the evil] Sir Guy of Gisbourne [Basil Rathbone, perhaps best known for playing `Sherlock Holmes'], knew an unaccustomed warmth this night, for Prince John and his friends [which includes the High Sheriff of Nottingham, played with comic brilliance by Melville Cooper] were met to celebrate a promising future.\\"<br /><br />However, Prince John underestimated the loyalty to King Richard of the Saxon Sir Robin of Locksley (Robin Hood) and his Merry Men.  Robin's main Merry Men included Will Scarlett (Pat Knowles), Much the miller's son (Herbert Mundin), the very tall Little John (Alan Hale, who played the part three times; his son was the skipper on \\"Gilligan's Island\\"), and Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette).  Robin later gets the help of Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland), the royal ward of King Richard.<br /><br />The movie ends with a climactic sword duel between Robin Hood and Sir Guy.  You can't miss this!<br /><br />All actors do extraordinary jobs in their roles.  And then there's Errol Flynn as Robin Hood.  He displays an irresistible charisma that shines through on screen and as well, imparts an athletic grace essential to this role.  (Do you know anyone else that can do this in leotards and a silly bonnet?)<br /><br />The Academy Award-winning background music for this movie is superb.  It adds to each scene.<br /><br />I also have this movie on videotape with all its distracting artifacts and dull colors.  The DVD, however, is perfect.  All artifacts have been removed.  All colors are lush.  The spoken word and music are crystal clear.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD includes fifteen extras, all of which I found interesting.  My favorite extras include:<br /><br />(1) \\"Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of the Adventures of Robin Hood.\\"  This 2003 documentary explains everything about this classic movie including how it was made, the people involved both behind and in front of the camera, and the evolution of the Robin Hood legend.<br />(2) Commentary by a film historian.  This historian does pretty much the same things as in #(1) above.  However, this commentary has the actual movie playing in the background as the historian is talking.<br />(3) Music-only audio track showcasing the movie's marvelous musical score.<br />(4) \\"Robin Hood through the Ages.\\"  A look at Robin Hood's earlier screen adaptations.<br />(5) \\"Classic Cartoons.\\"  Here you get to see Bugs Bunny in \\"Rabbit Hood\\" and Daffy Duck in \\"Robin Hood Daffy.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a classic movie that has been restored on DVD.  Never has Sherwood Forest looked so good!!!<br /><br />(1938;  29 scenes;  2 discs;  100 min;  full screen;  color)<br /><br />+++++chard.<br /><br />The movie ends with a climactic sword duel between Robin Hood and Sir Guy.

B00004W510|5.0|Having just \\"gotten into\\" The Band, two things stand out: <br /> <br />1) Robbie Robertson was absolutely right in breaking the group up when they did. Drug addiction was tearing them apart physically, ultimately leading to the deaths of Richard Manuel and Rick Danko. Levon Helm was, and still is bitter about it, but he was wrong. <br />2) Robertson did not solely compose these songs. While the original chord progressions and perhaps even the lyrics were his, the intrumentation and varied sounds were absolutely not. These songs should have been credited to the entire group. Robbie was an opportunist and took advantage of the situation. Still, it's very obvious that these songs were a group effort. <br /> <br />Buy this record.

0553208845|5.0|One of the greater books that i have ever read. This is a book that should be read by all, it makes for great conversation. This is a book that should be read with seriousness, and MUST be read with an open mind. Unless your reading abilities are high level, dont try to read this in one sitting (it is really short, but heavy), just because this is a book that needs to \\"sink in\\" when being read to be truly appreciated to the fullest. It is a book that in reading, it really would be beneficial to just think a bit after different sections. If you are someone un breakably stubborn and skeptical, this book wont help you, but then again, if you are someone close minded, not much in the world can help you, closeminded people, the really close minded ones are lost causes in my opinon, not worth the air they breathe.<br /><br />Siddhartha is somewhat flat of a character, and he cannot be understood unless you are allready a person with at least some of his traits (most people arent). Siddhartha's apparent \\"flatness\\" does not slow the book down, the point of the book if for the READER to be affected and undergo some character changes, not Siddhartha. Read this book to LEARN, not solely for pleasure.<br /><br />If you can manage it, try to read the last half of the book next to a fountain or flowing water, it increases the greatness.<br /><br />This is a book, along with Voltair's Candide and Robert Graves' translation of the Iliad (\\"The Anger of Achilles\\"), that i will try to read every year of my life.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all.
B00005JKQ6|4.0|On the surface (no pun intended), \\"The Swimmer\\" doesn't look like the sort of movie a diehard horror fan like myself would enjoy. Look at that DVD cover, for instance. Burt Lancaster and Janet Landgard staring dreamily at each other while standing in front of a sun drenched swimming pool. What is this madness? Why would I spend even a second with a film that simply reeks of romantic drama? Well, the DVD cover is as misleading as the beginning scenes of the film contained within. \\"The Swimmer\\" is about as far from a romantic melodrama as \\"Friday the 13th\\" is from \\"Meatballs.\\" This 1968 examination of the mental collapse of a member of America's affluent class is a horror lover's dream; a grim, unforgiving film that refuses to pull any punches when the \\"Twilight Zone\\" ending unfolds with all of its sinister implications. Sure, no one's head explodes, no one finds himself or herself on the receiving end of a sharp instrument, but that shouldn't preclude the serious shriek cinema aficionado from checking this downbeat picture out and giving it a whirl. \\"The Swimmer,\\" more than most other films I've seen recently, stays with you long after the final credits roll.<br /><br />Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster), when we first see him, seems like a guy who has it all. A strong, healthy looking fellow with a warm personality and a ready grin, Merrill jogs out of the foliage to banter with a few of his neighbors. Everyone around the pool seems to love this guy even though they claim they haven't seen him in ages. Lots of \\"hearty fellow well met\\" dialogue follows as Merrill's friends inquire about his family, his job, and his impressive physique. Ned fires back like pro, cajoling and chuckling with aplomb. After taking a dip in the swimming pool, our hero comes up with a plan. Surveying the Connecticut countryside, he suddenly realizes that it's entirely possible to \\"swim\\" home, namely by swimming through all of his neighbors' pools. His friends cackle at such craziness, but Merrill is undeterred. Off he goes on his personal little quest which, when you think about, is a fun idea. What better way to spend a summer day than passing through estate after estate loaded with well manicured lawns, opulent homes, and good company? Every pool Merrill will swim through belongs to people who have known him for years. As we'll soon see, however, this is far from a good thing.<br /><br />At first Ned finds his neighbors accommodating and personable, especially when he runs into his daughters' former babysitter lounging poolside with her friends. Julie Hooper (Janet Landgard) is a gorgeous young lady with blonde hair, and she seems quite happy to run into her old boss Ned. She's so happy to see him, in fact, that she agrees to join his mission. The two caper about, running through the forests separating the pools while talking about the good times. They even spend time running around in an old horse stall, leaping over obstacles and generally having a great time. Sadly, Hooper flees after an uncomfortable conversation with Ned in which she reveals she once had a crush on him. Merrill troops on alone, but now things don't go so well. His friends turn cold and distant--some resort to outright hostility when they see him--and very unpleasant information rises to the surface. Dark insinuations hint at Merrill's insolvency in all things financial, personal problems with the wife and kiddies, unemployment, and unpaid debts owed to local businesses. Ned doesn't seem to understand the animus aimed at him, but presses on nonetheless, determined to arrive home in time to play tennis with his young daughters. What will Ned Merrill find when he gets there?<br /><br />\\"The Swimmer\\" suffers a few flaws, including an incredibly dated score from Marvin Hamlisch and some very cheesy set pieces. For example, check out that huge pool party. Whew! Those dance moves nearly had me clawing my eyes out! But once you get past the idea that you're watching an older film from a timewhen fashion and music tended to be a little off the wall, you're in for a treat. The best part of the movie is simply trying to discern exactly what happened to Ned Merrill. He committed adultery, if the emotional scene where Ned confronts his embittered former mistress is any indication, and he moved through life like the world owed him something, but what exactly sent him over the edge? For that matter, is he over the edge? Or did something far more sinister occur? Why do all of his neighbors act as though they haven't seen him for ages? Where has he been since his disgrace? One suspects the local nuthouse put out an APB on this guy. \\"The Swimmer\\" raises far more questions than it's willing to answer, so if you need a film that lays everything out in the open you should probably look elsewhere. But if you like a film that keeps you guessing, that features a guy and a girl running around a track like a pair of horses, \\"The Swimmer\\" should be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Some maintain that the movie is an examination of the hollowness of the upper class, and in several respects that assertion contains grains of truth. The wealthy nudists (!) that spurn Ned, the endless parties and the drinking in the middle of the day (don't these people work?), and the attention to material possessions certainly supply plenty of evidence to back up this argument. But I think the movie is more interested in showing us one human being's inability to cope with tragedy than it is in revealing the decadence of a bunch of upper crust grand poobahs. Then again, I could be wrong. Give \\"The Swimmer\\" a watch and decide for yourself. Me? I'm putting on my trunks and going out for a dip in the pool!a time when fashion and music tended to be a little off the wall, you're in for a treat.

B00005221M|3.0|Cooper would have loved this film, except for maybe the love interest, o'well, it's just part of the feminization of America, Daniel Day Lewis is amazing as Hawkeye, his every move spoke of authentication, the entire film was cast very well, Wes Studi has become one of my favorites, beautiful scenery, it's just too bad the DVD has been butchered so badly, maybe some day we will get the \\"real\\" directors cut, fully restored with out-takes included.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have liked Shania Twain since her 2nd cd The Women In Me. When I bought this DVD thinking it was vidoes but when I opened it I read it was Live In Chicago. At first I was dissapointed because I wanted a video collection oops. I was gonna return it but said I'll keep it and watched it and it was a great DVD the best mistake I have ever bought and I have watched it to many times to admit. The performance was excellent mixing the old with the new. I think that show really brought out how very talented her band is they were awsome. Though its been 2 years I hope she plans a tour in 2005. A must have for the Shania Twain fan, I recommend it.
B000006NPY|4.0|I'm very impressed with the reviews people have given this album. In a lot of cases when a band does other music thats not like the regular stuff they release, there fans tend to disappear instead of giving the music a chance. But that wasn't the case here. The Pumkin fans have stayed loyal. Thats really awesome. This album is a really good album. A lot more mellow then anything the've done in the past, but its a nice change of pace for the Pumkins. I would definitly recommend this album. I read somewhere that this album was still dark like the rest of the Pumkin albums, but I would have to respectfully disagree. There is a lot more hope in this album then any other albums from there past. There music still has a dark touch to it, but the lyrics are definitly more on the uplifting side. Anyway, good cd.
0609610570|4.0|Larry Bossidy's and Ram Charan's book \\"Execution\\" is a guide that helps leaders to be successful if they use a corporate strategy that focuses on the ability that is most essential to every business - to get things done.  Bossidy and Charan forward the idea that execution is best achieved in a business setting through the three core processes of people, strategy, and operations. They argue that a leader must work closely with these three core processes in order to achieve execution and positive results. Therefore, this is not a book that explores individual execution as much as it instructs how a leader can get the most from their companies.   The writing is clear and simple. The book contains great details and energy to show how execution should be approached through people, strategy, and operations. In my opinion, it is great book for all struggling leaders and those who want to become great leaders. However, there are quite a few repetitions that make the book longer than it should be. Leaders could use that time on practicing execution instead of reading the same results again.
B000002KAT|2.0|I got into Van Morrison with \\"Poetic Champions Compose\\" back in the '80s, and can say that through the lovely services of Amazon.com I have now bought EVERY one of his albums.  Yes, I'm talking even clunkers like \\"You Win Again.\\"  Yet, I am not a rabid Van fan;  rather, a crazed collector of Kate Bush, Roxy Music, Peter Gabriel and Cocteau Twins.  That being said, I recognize that the Van Fan Club has apparently descended on this site with the overwhelming 5 star review for ASTRAL WEEKS, and I recognize many critics give this album high regards as well.  But this review is not for the Fan Club, but for you, dear casual buyer of Van's work, who is looking to expand beyond, say Moondance, Poetic Champions and Avalon Sunset.  To thee, I say, verily \\"this album is not very good.\\"  ASTRAL weeks came out late in 1968, and is truly a product of its times (and thus NEW Van fan beware):  Its hippy sentimentalities and instrumentation are just downright annoying today.  If you were THERE at the time, back in 69-70, or picked this up in the early 70's after hearing Moondance blow your mind, then this album RESONATES with you because it comes with the dust of nostalgia (credits to Dylan on that phrase).  Stripped of any personal nostalgia, casual Van fans, this album is not very good.  Up until the Beatles' monumental \\"Seargeant Peppers\\" effectively established modern album rock in '67, Van was known as the 3 minute rocker/popper doing \\"Here Comes the Night,\\"  \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" and \\"Chicka Boom.\\"  He obviously went back to the woodshed and retooled his songwriting (for a year plus!) after \\"Seargeant Peppers\\" came out.  ASTRAL WEEKS was a startling new vision from a heretofore 3 minute rocker, and that probably blew people's lids back in the 60's.  OK, highlights would be \\"Sweet Thing\\" which is as close to a structured song (chorus/verse) that one could come, and maybe the last bit of \\"Madame George\\" where Van starts to settle into a nice groove.  But the album is just darn annoying.  Van's voice is HARSH - both in terms of its timbre (high, thin, kinda angry, in-your-face in the mix), and in how he uses it, trying to swoop, scat, etc.  Other than Sweet Thing, there is no real song STRUCTURE to these songs - it's mainly bass player Davis soloing (mixed very high in the mix) to Van's stream of consciousness vocals.  And if you want Sweet Thing, get the Best Of, Vol. II, which has other great tracks as well.  I guess if you were there in the 60's and see this as a soundtrack to your '69 'Cuda roadtrip, or if you're a student of poetry, regardless of the MUSICALITY of the song, then this album may have further rewards.  But really, if you're getting into Van and want to explore beyond the usual greatest albums, Moondance, Tupelo Honey, Avalon Sunset (yeah!), Poetic Champions Compose or Best Of Volume I, try the following, available on Amazon.com:  Wavelength (Oh come on people, how about \\"Hungry For Your Love\\"?); His Band and Street Choir (Gypsy Queen, etc.); The Crying Game (love it, sounds like the whole thing should be covered by Bonnie Raitt).  The problem with ASTRAL WEEKS is its just so damn free form, without much song structure (and without the exhilerating unexpected rewards of improvisation that one gets from say bebop Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis etc).  I mean, come on, 8 minutes repeating one chord progression?  I don't care how \\"meaningful\\" the lyrics are; even Arlo Guthrie on the 18 minute Alice's Restaurant (from the same 60s hippy period) had a snappy chorus to reward at the end).  I really WANTED to like ASTRAL WEEKS, especially since I forked out the $$ to Amazon.com to buy it.  So go into buying this album knowing it's historically significant and well regarded by those who were there when it came out, but if you don't already know all the songs on this album, the plain fact is you probably won't like it much. And that's hard to say for someone who even has \\"Hard Nose The Highway.\\"
B00005JMUL|2.0|I took my daughter to see this movie just after Christmas.  I heard mostly good reviews about it and it seemed like a very good movie from what I saw from the trailers (the computer graphics looked amazing).  But I also heard from many parents I knew that their children were so frightened by this movie that they had to leave the theater early.  I sort of poo-poohed them, thinking that some kids were afraid of everything.  I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />There were only two good things about this movie.  1.  The scenery is (mostly) beautiful beyond belief and looks real, and 2.  my daughter was not frightened, though I wouldn't have been surprised if she was.  If I was three years old and saw this movie, I would have probably screamed the whole way through.  It's not like any Christmas movie I've ever seen.  There's nothing cheerful or uplifting about it.  It's very dark, depressing, & scary.  It's much more reminscient of a Halloween movie than a Christmas one.  I wish I had never taken my daughter to see it.  The theme seemed to be, \\"If you don't believe in Santa Claus, you're going to have to go on a train ride from hell and scare the pants off of you.\\"  That doesn't seem to be a very good thing to tell young children.<br /><br />Not only does it not have a very good story, but the characters are very unoriginal and wooden too.  They all only have one quality--the main character is brave, maybe too brave (he climbs onto the top of a moving train in the middle of a snow storm to get a friend's train ticket for example), one is saintly, one is withdrawn and depressed, while another is annoying beyond belief.  None were even the slightest bit interesting.  Though the scenery was realistic, the human characters were stiff and lifeless, resembling the animatronic characters on Disney Rides.  Far away they look real enough, but when you get closer, it's more than obvious they're only manniquins.<br /><br />I figured while watching the movie that when the traumatic train ride was over that the North Pole would be amazing and stunningly beautiful.  I was wrong about that too.  The town at the North Pole looked like something you'd see behind the Iron Curtain in the 1950's, boring, bland, and desolate, while all the elves (all male and all clones of each other) and even Santa, looked a little bit creepy.  Near the end, the elves enjoy a concert put on by than no other than Aerosmith, which seemed very odd and didn't fit with the overly serious & melancholy tone of the movie.<br /><br />I would definitely not recommend this movie, especially for young children.  I only gave it two stars because of the incredible background scenery and the train (which is designed to perfection and looks like it could be real.)  Other than that, it's not very good at all.  Maybe model train enthusiasts would like it, or people who enjoy freaking out young children, but other than that, I can't think of anyone else who would possibly enjoy this movie.in ride was over that the North Pole would be amazing and stunningly beautiful.

B000004CYT|5.0|Known mostly for authentic performances of older music, I was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful performances of Beethoven's great nine symphonies.  I initially just purchased a CD of the first two performed by AAM under Hogwood, however being sufficiently impressed by their performance of those early symphonies, I purchased the entire set.  Very nice performances that I think Beethoven would have approved of.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com

0151008116|2.0|A boy stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger in the middle of the Pacific.  It takes quite a masterful writer to make a story out of this premise, and let me tell you, Mr. Martel is not that masterful writer.   The story starts slow, never builds a climax, and certainly does not end with a bang.  Characters are marginally developed, and scenes are poorly described.  I can't figure out why, but the book advertises itself as a story that makes you believe in God.   Come to think of it though, there must be a God if a book like this can get published!
B00005S6K8|2.0|Sydney Pollack says that he was reluctant to direct this movie, a remake of the version with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, but was finally coaxed into it by Harrison Ford. He had to be disappointed with the result, however, for the resulting comparisons were inevitable. The story stays with the essentials: two brothers-  Ford, the older one, a serious and successful businessman; the other, the irresponsible, handsome playboy played by Greg Kinnear-  vying for the affections of the chaffeur's daughter, Julia Ormand, playing the center role in a variation of the Cinderella tale. It was updated for the modern era, including the politics and finance of corporate take-overs, but otherwise is faithful to the theme of its predecessor. Among other things, one point seems to be clear: why Ford wanted it made. It's a full-blown screen confirmation (do I mean intention?) that our Indiana Jones Superstar still has that \\"thing,\\" that ability to attract younger women, as his character does in the story. Unfortunately, with a stiff, cardboard performance, he demonstrates none of the irony and vulnerability that Humphrey Bogart brought to this role. Likewise, as ravishing as Ormand can be, she, too, lacks the coquettish charm that Hepburn could provide. Together, they make an unappealing pair, as there's little apparent chemistry between the two stars.  Kinear, for his part, is pretty good, as he lately has developed a real penchant for playing the cad, but he too falls short when put up against William Holden.  To make matters worse, the script doesn't lend too much aid to the cast, lacking the wit and zest of the original. Overall, this is not a worthy re-do, but more simpy boring.<br />Pollack would be the first one to admit that they don't make movies the way they used to. So, when he hesitated on this one, he should have stayed with his initial instincts.
0385510454|5.0|From his very first novel until his current work, John Grisham has evolved as a writer, having become more introspective and a keener judge of human character.  <br /> <br />The Broker is a cross-genre classic that melds the thriller with wonderful insights into the culture of modern Italy all the while analyzing the the flawed but repentant soul of its hero, Joel Backman.  <br /> <br />Grisham never creates perfect characters, even the good guys have unmistakeable flaws. Even the bad guys have good in them. That's the case with the Broker.  <br /> <br />A highly charged political plot hatched by the powerful invalid who runs the CIA snatches corporate criminal and former powerful lobbyist, Joel Backman from the depths of prison life into the unique culture of Italy. Always on the run and yet nowhere to go, Backman is forced to become one with those around him in the slow-paced everday life of Milan. Until he makes his break and undoes all the wrong he manifested on the world during his heyday.  <br /> <br />Grisham delivers a mildly thrilling, but especially captivating novel full of suspense, rich, layered characters, and introspection into Italian culture. Its a fine read, a wonderful book, and another chapter in the evolving work of John Grisham.
B00005JNEW|5.0|There can be no doubt that Friday Night Lights is a remarkably good motion picture, but I have to admit that I have mixed emotions about the film.  Maybe that is a good thing because one thing this movie makes almost all of us do is think about ourselves.  The majority of us are in there somewhere - maybe you're the dad who puts too much pressure on your kid to be a star athlete, or the coach's wife whose very way of life becomes defined by a simple game made much too complicated by the community, or the rabid fan who lives and dies with your team and never hesitates to berate a coach or player who makes one mistake.  Maybe you're the star athlete who saw your dreams die in the form of a serious injury, or the little guy who had to prove your toughness, etc.  If you care enough about sports to watch this movie, you're in here somewhere.<br /><br />Back to my mixed feelings, though.  I love football; it's a great sport that lets you have some fun and learn important lessons, such as teamwork, you can put to good use throughout your life - but there is an ugly side to the sport, and Friday Night Lights shows you just about everything that is wrong with this great game.  There is nothing fun about being a Panther during the season chronicled in this film.  On day one of practice, every kid on every high school team should want a state championship, but none should expect it.  Desire brings out the best in you, while expectation sets you up for a fall.  In Odessa, Texas, though, the very spirit of the game is betrayed by the adults in the community; not only do they expect a championship, they demand it; these most rabid of fans might know every play in the playbook, but they know nothing about what football (in my opinion) should really be all about.  The stress these kids feel to not only win, but pulverize every opponent is much more than any 17-year-old should ever have to bear.<br /><br />The film basically takes us through the 1988 football season for the Panthers, from the first practice to the final game.  That first practice sets an ugly tone for what is to come, and things get even uglier when the team's star running back hurts his knee in the first game.  It will not be a perfect season in Odessa.  Losing, of course, brings out the worst in some people who were already pretty bad to begin with.  The parent of a chronic fumbler, already embarrassed that his son isn't following in his footsteps, pretty much goes off the deep end; the quarterback, living with an ailing mother and desperate for a scholarship that can take him away from this town, gets pushed pretty close to the breaking point, and the star player refuses to believe he is seriously injured because he can't imagine a life without football.  What of the coach, the enabler, the molder of young minds?  Billy Bob Thornton may be terrific in this film, but I never got inside the head of the coach he played.  In the end, I see him as perhaps the worst kind of coach you can have.  He's not honest with his team, he doesn't take care of his players, and he puts an obviously injured player back in action without even consulting either of the doctors who examined him.  He plays down expectations at times, but it's just an act; all too soon he is frothing at the mouth on the sidelines.  Some say he figures things out in the end, realizes that football is just a game, but I disagree.  That heartfelt talk with the quarterback: a cruel form of motivation; that half-time speech at the big game: more psychological motivation.  It's all about winning for him - that's my interpretation, at least.<br /><br />The film does have its moments, though.  When the injured superstar finally breaks down, it's more than a poignant moment - the film virtually stops right there; it's one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a long time.  Other big moments, though, rubbed me the wrong way.  Having your father finally show something better than contempt for you is good, but the reason whyit happens in this case sends a message I find quite wrong.<br /><br />This is definitely a film about high school football.  Academics, the very thing that high school is supposed to be all about, is nowhere to be found here - except in the reading problems of a certain star athlete and random comments about more money going to athletics than education.  As a full-fledged nerd, and as someone currently involved in education who has to hold his tongue when he sees luxurious athletics buildings erected on a campus desperately needing additional classrooms, I am going to have to stifle myself right here.  It does disappoint me a little bit to interpret this film the way I do - for, the way I see it, it ultimately says winning isn't everything - but it is pretty darn close.  Whatever its message, though, Friday Night Lights does make you think, and it is a gripping sports-related film, and that is more than enough to make it well worth watching.ason why it happens in this case sends a message I find quite wrong.   <br /> <br />This is definitely a film about high school football.

0195170776|5.0|I knew I would like this new edition, but I didn't know how much! The Oxford American Dictionary is the best new dictionary of American English out there. It seems counterintuitive that OXFORD would make a great AMERICAN dictionary, but they really have more coverage than the other dictionaries I have (and I have a lot of dictionaries!).  <br /> <br />The new edition has so much more material, including a really great new essay on etymology and new synonym studies.  <br /> <br />I personally like the new page layout much better. The old one was very \\"dance-y\\" and distracting -- too much going on. This one is much simpler and flows better. I had no trouble finding the phrases (they begin with a dark triangle and the word PHRASES in bold type, so they're hard to miss!). The eytmologies start with an open triangle, but they always come near the end of the entry so I don't see how they're difficult to find, either. The font they use for the pronunciations is easier to read, as well, and they now have the key on every right-hand page. <br /> <br />And this new edition has a CD inside the book that lets you load the ENTIRE DICTIONARY on your smartphone or Blackberry or Treo! <br /> <br />If using a dictionary makes you cranky, you owe it to yourself to get this one and never feel cranky about looking something up again. It is the most usable, best-laid-out, most comprehensive dictionary I've seen yet.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Rating: A <br />Though some would argue that the departure of frontman Syd Barret would cause the decline of one of the most experimental, and influential rock bands of the late 60's, it was actually the genius artists departure that fueled the fire for most of Floyd's remaining catalog of music. Released in 1968, Saucerful of Secrets, dabbles in dynamics and sounds much in the same way as the previous effort The Piper at the Gates of Dawn did, creating a slightly whimsical, but overtly dark and foreboding prescence in each of the songs. As the band became more popular, Barrets \\"problems\\" became more and more apparent, leading to his steady decline of his mental structure, along with any resemblence of the friend that the band once knew. After basically deciding just to not pick up Syd on the way to one of their shows, thus kicking the man behind the music out of the band, Floyd followed up their surrealistic masterpiece, with a tour de force of an album. <br />Starting with Let There be Light, the album opens to let you know that even though the man and the mystery has departed, the band is still in tune with its amazing distortions and manipulations of sound. All the songs have a playful, melancholy feel to them, with the exception being the title track interspersed at the middle of the album, taking center stage, as a dynamic voyage through sound and a trip through the imagination of these aspiring and developing songwriters. Basically if you enjoyed  PatGoD you will enjoy this album, as long as you can understand the mythos of Floyd, and the magic behind their music. 'Tis a shame that some bash this album as a \\"sophmore jinx\\" as truly, this album is as experimental as their previous effort, but with Barret nixed down to only one track at the end of the album, it might be a downer to some. Perhaps Jugband Blues, was Floyd's early ode to their original frontman, and the beginning of his legacy, which would climax with one of the greatest albums of all time with Wish You Were Here. The musicianship of this album is auspicious, and masterful as the landscapes of music are a dense apparation of ones mind, and this is one album that should not be overlooked in the Floyd catalog. Have fun listening, later.
0786890754|1.0|I kept trying to finish this book, because the story seemed cute. However, it is very hard to read while rolling your eyes every third word. This book is unintentionally funny many times when it uses trite or literal wording. For example, \\"Holly explained the story about the woman in the salon and they both rolled around laughing.\\" Good lord. Throughout the entire part that I did read, all I could think of was my junior high teacher saying \\"Show, don't tell\\" - I think Cecelia Ahern must have been absent the day that concept was taught in school.  <br /> <br />Other reviewers commented on how her dad is Ireland's prime minister. I may be wrong, but I think he wrote a fawning review on this site. Somehow, that made the book even more pathetic to me.  <br /> <br />I wish I could give the book two stars because her intention was to tell a good story, but I just can't get over the awful writing. Maybe she will have worked on that with her next book, Rosie Dunne - but I am not going to spend the money on it to find out.
0618526412|2.0|I read this book because it was mentioned and held in very high regard in the book I just finished Off Magazine Street. Although it was very well written, it's definitely not for everyone and it made me feel as though I was reading it for a class. It was a struggle at times. I appreciated it, but would not recommend it.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I used to think I knew what good TV was. HAH. I had no idea. Until this show came along (dramatic much?). Seriously though, I've fallen in love with this show. It's completely and utterly perfect. The chemistry the actors have is amazing, the storylines are emosewa, and you couldn't ask for better writing. I know the earliest release possible of this DVD will help the show, as many people who want to start watching it feel it's too late. If they could buy the DVD sometime this summer, I'm sure they would start watching Season 2. This show is so addictive...I can't wait for the DVD. <br /> <br />In Rob I Trust.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|The art and animation in \\"Robots\\" are the star of the show --incredibly detailed and inventive. The commuting scene near the beginning is a vertiginous and seemingly endless escapade through loops and jumps and slides that was as delightful to the eye as it was turbulent to the stomach. And there's a domino scene that is just stunning. The movie's characters are lovable and well-drawn, and the action is VERY fast-paced.<br /><br />The story--a hoary and cliched tale of a down-and-out kid trying to make it to the big time--nearly sinks the film. There were the expected subplots of \\"doing it for my Dad,\\" and taking on the big corporation -- this time a soul-sucking firm intent on making a profit (and running out the small-timers) with shiny new products that everyone was induced to buy. I don't suppose there's any irony that the film, made by a big business (20th Century Fox), is making oodles by pandering to the very folks who are pushed around by big business. Alas.<br /><br />\\"Robots\\" includes an awful lot of toilet and sexual humor, most of which will sail thankfully right over he kiddos' heads. Some won't, though, and is thoroughly unfunny. A character with an enormous backside was the source of a string of vacuous rear-end jokes. The extended farting scene might have delighted six-year-olds but seemed out of place in a robot movie -- don't you need flesh to fart? And was it that hard for the writers to resist telling a meek character to \\"grow some bolts\\"? One senses that Robin William and Drew Carey (who voiced two of the characters) improvised some if this \\"adult\\" dialog. We're a long way from \\"Alladin,\\" here, both in humor and intelligence.<br /><br />Personally, the best way to enjoy the movie is with the dialog off, allowing you to enjoy the incredible animation (the shots of oil flowing over metal are incredible) and action without the turnoff of the incessant potty humor and banal story line.
B00005JMAH|1.0|I have read this book at least 30 times so seeing the movie shouldnt have confused me as much as it did.  I cant imagine what a person who hasnt read the book would think.  The movie makes no sense, I dont understand why the screenwriter and director left out so many plot points, but found time to put in pointless sceenes with shrunken heads, harry deep in thought or harry walking through the woods talking to lupin(that especially makes no sense for lupin to spend so much time with harry. I know he did in the book, but I dont recall them having deep heart to heart talks. Most people arent that close with their teachers.) <br /> <br />All in all I just dont like this movie, it will go on my list of the worst movies Ive seen. Not because it is that terrible, but the book is so incredibly good, I cant understand how this came from it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|<br />When i went to see The Red Hot Chili Peppers in london last summer their set consisted mostly of californication tracks,which was great because i have always thought of californication as a really summery jump about album partly due to its number of upbeat songs (and hot front cover!).The track that stands out for me from this album will always be californication but there are some real other quality songs and each one goes in a different direction.There are quieter tunes such as this velvet glove and porcelain and faster paced tracks such as right on time and paralell universe.Alot of the tunes are quite experimental for the chili peppers as soem are quite unlike the bands previous material.The album has a good balance of fire fuelled tracks and moving mellow ones. <br />Californication is a must because the chili peppers,such talented and experienced musicians who are really at one with what they do,make its catchy guitar riffs and feel good beats cant help but work their way into your head!Defnitly my faviroute and i hope it becomes your too! <br />
B000002GQG|4.0|(Four and a half stars).  The Moody Blues' \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" was a superb follow-up to \\"Days of Future Passed.\\"  The band, in dropping the symphony orchestra, demonstrated thier prodigious talent in playing all the instruments themselves, whether it be harp, cello, flute, harpsichord or, of course, the pervasive mellotron.  I look at this as a concept album: We all have lost our minds, in attempting to keep up with our unenlightened lives, and we need to find an alternative (\\"Departure\\" with that wonderful Graeme Edge insane laugh at the end -- which I understand was unintentional; and \\"Ride My See Saw,\\" about being in the rat race with the inability to advance -- \\"but by now I know I should have run\\").  We attempt to search through physical travel (\\"Dr. Livingstone I Presume\\" -- \\"we're all looking for something\\").  On the next level, we turn to doorways in the mind and substances (\\"House of Four Doors,\\" \\"Legend of a Mind\\").  The next level is to look to the Divine and Love (\\"Voices in the Sky,\\" \\"Visions of Paradise,\\" \\"The Actor\\") with some astral projection (\\"Thinking is the Best Way to Travel\\").  Finally, we achieve perfect spirituality (\\"The Word,\\" \\"Om\\").    Okay, so admittedly the above is a little silly and pretentious.  But, \\"Ride My See-Saw,\\" with its soaring four part harmonies, is, in my opinion, one of John Lodge's two best songs (the other being \\"I'm Just a Singer\\").  \\"Legend of a Mind\\" is Ray Thomas' signature song and has those wonderfully memorable lyrics about Timothy Leary (did anybody hear the cover of this song, albeit about Jennifer Love Hewitt, in the movie \\"Mayor of the Sunset Strip\\"?).  \\"Voices in the Sky\\" and \\"The Actor\\" are wonderful offerings by Justin Hayward, typical of his extraordinary singing and songwriting that he consistently displayed in the first seven albums.  My criticism is that the rest of the album is just alright. \\"House of Four Doors\\" and \\"Om,\\" are simply too long, and downright pretentious, even by Moody Blues standards.  \\"Dr. Livingstone,\\" \\"Best Way to Travel,\\" and \\"Visions\\" are not bad, but don't stand out.  That being said, however, after recording its classic predecessor, the Moodies avoided the typical \\"sophomore slump\\" with the psychedelic classic \\"In Search of the Lost Chord.\\"
1400032717|5.0|This is the story of a young autistic kid who decides to investigate a murder (of a dog) while at the same time writing about his experiences in a book. <br /> <br />The story is simple, short and is guaranteed to keep you reading \\"that one more page\\". The narration is very effective and the author (Mark Haddon) has really created what i'm sure would be a classic! <br /> <br />Another big plus is that this book will surely appeal to readers of all ages -- which in my opinion is something extrodinary and tought to achieve. I also believe that it means that this is a quality work. <br /> <br />\\"Totally Recommended\\"
B000001EGE|5.0|While many critics and fans cite Elton's 1973 album \\"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player\\" as the emergence of the \\"new and glitzy pop Elton\\", This 1972 release, while far more tame and less extravagant, was the first release of Elton's to show the turning of the tide. Up until this point, Elton's albums were darker, more somber, more serious. Elton's live shows in the U.S. were anything but. On stage he was a madman at the piano. Thumping away with great gusto and flair. His first 4 albums showed Elton as entirely different. It was decided that the powers that be wanted the Elton that was on stage, the 'live' Elton, to be translated to the records themselves. Make Elton, who already had a few hits under his belt at the time, more accessible. And \\"Honky Chateau\\" was the brilliant result. Released in 1972, the shift in tone was evident off the bat. The album was written in five days(!), and it was recorded within the walls of Chateau d'Hierouville(hope I spelled that right!). The resulting album had a more unified band feel to it, and the music was fantastic. You knew things were different with the first track, \\"Honky Cat\\". A funky pop tune that is far more complex and structured than just a fun, fly away pop tune. Something Elton is always good at. A jaunty little pop tune with a dark edge was \\"I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself\\", a track that cleverly goes against it's title and lyrics by having a jaunty pop tune to it. \\"Mellow\\" may not of broken the mold or set Elton's career on fire, but it is a pleasing and soothing little ballad. Sweet and nothing more. One track I really have no feeling for is the ballad, \\"Salvation\\", a tune that really has nothing to it and goes nowhere. \\"Susie(Dramas)\\" is a funky little up tempo number, that may not stand out so much, but sounds good as you are listening to it. The very slow ballad \\"Slave\\" is given two different interpretations here. I already mentioned the slow as molasses one, and the other version is a revved up rock version. The song does have a great piano part in the rock version, and a pretty good catch too, so it makes it the more essential version. \\"Amy\\" is pretty much a flat out rocker. One of Elton's hardest rockers at that point. It sounds good and fills out the album, but will mostly be forgotten afterwards. Same with the album closer, \\"Hercules\\". Two of the stand outs here are the big ballads. \\"Rocket Man\\" is here. Although Elton had only a scant few hits at this point(Your Song, Friends, and Levon), this track was his first real smash hit, although \\"Your Song\\" in 1970 was a top ten hit as well. It's a great example of Elton's way with a simple pop ballad that can be turned into something more. The other is a song that's a classic to me and others, but wasn't released as a single. That song is \\"Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters\\". The song has gained a lot of following and a definite place in Elton's canon in the last several years because of Elton incorporating it more and more into his shows and other performances. It is a stark and rich ballad, with wonderful lyrics by Taupin. A sequel(of sorts) was released 16 years later, to a much lesser degree, on 1988's \\"Reg Strikes Back\\". There was an obvious change to Elton's delivery as well. More fresh, spirited, and pop/rocky. The lyrics by Taupin were fresher and more accesible, and allowed more from Elton. HC is looked upon as one of Elton's finer moments. At the time, it was. It won't be put up on the pedestal with \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Captain Fantastic\\" and others, but it is a fine, fine piece of work. It is one of the better Elton efforts, and at the time of it's release, was his best effort. It would be in the top five. Honky Chateau is classic, warm, and inviting. It's time to visit it again.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|She looks damn hot in her album!!!! <br /> <br />As for the music, they are ALL GOOD! They reason I give it a 4 star instead of 5 is that I hoped to hear some inspiring songs such as Hero, through the rain in this album. However, all of them are love songs except for the last one.  <br /> <br />Mariah is so sexy! You definitely don't wanna miss this album!
B00000I07P|1.0|... how awful this band are and this album is, already just looking at this page has allowed that dumb piece of non-sensical tosh, aka Living On A Prayer, to filter into my mind and thoroughly depress me with its complete and utter blandness. i am ready to end it now, luckily i have an antidote, i hum \\"I'm In the Mood for Dancing\\" by the Nolans, yes i agree, complete rubbish, but even that's better than anything by bon jovi. buy this album just to burn it.. make a statement!
B00005AQF7|5.0|this album has not one song that isnt amazing.......every song has amazing beats...amazing lyrics....snoop dogg was never the same after this one. <br /> <br />every song gets 5/5 <br /> <br />this is one of dre's finest produced albums <br /> <br />pure classic
B0007Y4USW|5.0|This CD is by far the best she has ever come out with!! ITs amazing how she continues to do it!!! The songs are sooooo BEAUTIFUL and anyone in love or finding their one and only or trying to Shake it off will be able to understand where her lyrics are coming from!!! <br />You MUST OWN THIS CD!!! <br />you will not regret it!!! I assure you, you will enjoy every track.... <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I think they are fantastic!  My fav songs are On Top, Andy You're a Star and Everything will be Alright.  I'm seeing them live May 31st here in Toronto and I hope they are as good live as they are on their album.  <br />I've been listeneing to them straight for months and haven't gotten sick of the CD yet.  It is worth the buy and the listen to!<br />Signed, HUGE Killer's Fan!
B0007WZUMO|5.0|Awesome album, love the whole thing.  I have all the Halo's including this one.  I'll admit that I don't like this as much as the downward spiral, but it is still an amazing album.  At least as good as the fragile, better than broken, maybe tied with pretty hate machine, but most of all just different.  Trent truly doesn't care if you like it or not, he makes music for him, take it or leave it.  Don't write this album off before it has had a chance to grow on you.  Pretty Hate Machine was the only NIN album that didn't have to grow on me, but everything else did.  Once this album grows on you, you will love it.  It was worth the wait as always :).
B000063DFS|5.0|This album has it all- Heavy Riffs- Great Chorus- And THE AMAZING GUITAR SOLOS! MY FAV OZZY BY FAR!!!!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I give this album a 4 and a half star if i could.  This album is excellent from start to finish.  The only song that didn't capture my attention from start to finish was homecoming.   <br /> <br />One of my favorite song on this album is she a rebel.  This song is unlike anything i have ever heard.  The only two repeative song on this album is blvd of broken dream and watsername.  in retrospect they are quite good on their own.  I Definitely like blvd of broken dream more than whatsername.   <br /> <br />Now the song that i have heard the most have to be American idiot.  Some on here say that it the worst song on this album, but i would say i fine it as one of my favorite song of all time.   <br /> <br />my second favorite song on this album would have to be jesus of suburbia.  Dang, Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tres Cool really know how to make a 9 min song enjoyable.  This is why green day is so unique on their own.  I haven't seen a band that Divided their song into subcategory.  This is by far the most impressing thing i have seen. <br /> <br />Now if most of you are thinking if you should buy this album or not, my answer would be \\"if you don't buy this, you are truly an american idiot!\\" <br />
B000005RFQ|5.0|Is this the old style 1970's Black Sabbath? No, it is not, and I wouldn't have it any other way--and not that I don't *love* early Black Sabbath, because I do--but because this album, judged solely outside of the older \\"Sabbath\\" frame of reference, is one of top ten best albums of all time, and, even more amazingly, in \\"spite\\" of some of its songs, rather than due to them... <br /> <br />As a Black Sabbath album, it is great as well, and is the heaviest and darkest of all their works. Ozzy is obviously absent, and gone is the \\"softer touch\\" of the RJD era--this Black Sabbath comes right from the pit. It has some truly creepy and beautiful moments, and the end of \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" makes the flesh crawl. <br /> <br />Trashed. Stonehenge. Disturbing the Priest. Born Again. Those four songs make this album a five-star entry. \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" and \\"Born Again\\" are both top-ten all time Sabbath bests, and that is something considering it is without Ozzy! <br /> <br />This album easily beats \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and \\"Never Say Die.\\" It also beats 1/2 of \\"Black Sabbath,\\" and kicks several tracks of \\"Sabotage\\" into the gutter.  <br /> <br />A must get. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|When you listen to the Stripped version of the album it's as if Gavin is singing directly to you.  You can hear every breath he takes and feel every note change.  I listen to it on my ipod and I swear it's like he's singing into your ear.  His lyrics are incredible and the stripped down version really lets you concentrate on the words.  You'd think it would be monotomous to listen to the same album twice, but they are really quite different.  Chariot Stripped showcases what an incredible talent Gavin really is and how he can actually truly sing.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Personally, I love this CD. Its a very original variation on your everyday emo band. The lyrics may talk about everyday angsty things, but at least they attempt to tell a story and the songs have very dynamic arrangements. <br />As for the bashers of emo: Keep in mind that emo is mostly suited for teens. For the time in a persons life when emotions are magnified a thousand times and a break-up with a boy/girlfriend is an epic rift in the universe. And i can say from expierience that fans of emo bands are the most passionate, devoted fans in the world, and that is what music is about (how it makes you feel, NOT how intelligent it is). And I can bet that no one ever feels the same passion for music ever again than what they felt as a teenager. So let those crazy emo kids have thier fun while they can.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|If anything this CD is worth 5 stars for its originality.  You can't find songwriting music like this nowadays.  Gavin DeGraw's lyrics pull you in and his voice is so pure.  The raspy tone of his voice screams for you to sing along.  With so much hip/hop nowadays asking you to shake your ass it's nice to be able to listen to someone who is mellow and just wants you to enjoy the music.  Listen to the CD once and you'll get hooked.
B000002OX5|5.0|This is just a great album that should be owned by any fan of 60's music, and centrainly by any fan of The Who. If you do not know about this album it is The Who's first concept album. It is meant to sound like a radio station (and does) as it has catchy jingles between most songs and a few songs that are a whole advertisments (Heniz Baked Beans/Medac). It works well and creates a unique feel to the album.  <br /> <br />   The extra tracks on this album are all good and recorded around the same time as the orginal tracks. The booklet is infomative but really exagarates how good the album is, and the meaning of songs. The author claims it is his favorite Who album and the best album of the era. They also claim that songs like tatto represent the attidue in the 60's which is strange because theres only so much meaning you can get out of a song about a person getting a tatto. You can hear the begginings of Tommy is this albums with parts that sound like Sparks, Uncle Ernie and the line \\"It's a girl Mrs. Walker its a girl\\" from It's a boy
1416909532|5.0|Ok, read this book before you go out and start to date. I like this book from the perspective that before you get invested with the guy watch how the treats you. Now once again, do not get invested with a guy until you see how he treats you. This book suggests you deserve someone that will treat you the way you want to be treated. Do not settle for less.<br /><br />It is a little cold hearted, but I think for the most part this book might save you some anguish. This book almost employs the tough love approach. You can not work from the perspective that you can make someone into the person that you want them to be, but if they do not match your standards move on, immediately.<br /><br />Once again this book isn't about forming deep and meaningful relationships, but should really be a way to cull through the men in your life, and finding your keepers. Its a quick read, but worthwhile. A good book on relationships and those dynamics is Make Up, Don't Break Up by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil.
B0000CABK8|5.0|I just can't figure out what is up with the other reviewers who are so hung up on whether or not this boxed set should have been made or not....  Why do they care that some of the movies included in this set are collector editions and some are not?  Don't they realize that offering something for everyone is the American way?  Instead, why not tell me about the sound or picture quality? <br /> <br />I did buy this set, and am thrilled to have all 10 movies at my fingertips any time I'm ready for an evening of sci-fi entertainment.  And they take up only half the shelf space as all 10 individual movies would.  Such a deal!
B000002O51|2.0|The worst tragedy of this album isn't so much that it's resolutely awful. I've certainly heard worse albums. It's that clearly Tom Scholz believes he's made a significant artistic statement.<br /><br />He proudly boasts (twice!) that \\"it took nearly six years to conceive and complete this album\\" (in his home studio in his garage). He spends a full page of the liners explaining exactly how it was recorded (all-analog), with what instruments (he goes so far as to tell you type of pickup on the guitars), what effects (\\"No those aren't violins, they're electric guitars through a Rockman\\") and when he wrote them (he was scrounging as far back as 1972 for material). There's another full page of acknowledgements. If that doesn't convince you of Scholz's self-importance, how about lectures on vegetarianism and animal rights? It's easier to forgive a little conceit when it's backed up with great art, but that's in little evidence here.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />\\"Amanda\\", the album's only hit, was a deserved one. It's a catchy well-produced hummable ballad. Outside of that, the only other one that really made me take notice was rocker \\"Cool the Engines\\".<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />\\"My Destination\\" is completely derivative of \\"Amanda\\". Compare them and tell me they're not the same song with different lyrics. (And you can't get away with telling me it's a \\"reprise\\" as part of a concept album. You don't change lyrics on a reprise. This is Scholz trying to pull a fast one.) \\"The Launch\\" was an overblown attempt at creating the sound of a \\"liftoff\\" as a pre-amble to \\"Cool the Engines\\". It doesn't work. It's nowhere near as great a lead-in as \\"Foreplay\\" was for \\"Long Time\\". \\"Hollyann\\" is a self-congratulatory backslap to aging hippies.(\\"Hollyann/We made the dark into the light/We saw the wrong and the right/We were for life/And we would never concede it\\") It leaves a bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />The songs are mostly faceless. I hope during the 6 years Scholz spent in the garage he was able to find time to tuneup the vehicles and clean up the room in general. If not, he pretty much has nothing to show for all that time.ears Scholz spent in the garage he was able to find time to tuneup the vehicles and clean up the room in general.

0316168815|5.0|Having followed the success of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" I finally broke down and paid full price for the book. As a bestseller, it wouldn't sink into the discount bins while the media continued to rave about it. I'm glad I broke down. Alice Sebold's writing is superbly transparent. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" has what readers of good fiction always want; the safe suspension of disbelief. Sebold's spare but haunting technique gives Susie Salmon, adolescent narrator and victim of wanton murder, a striking voice.<br /><br />I must explain that I could have been Susie. Like her, I used to thread my way through a quaint suburb on my way home from school. Like Susie, I was a girl who wore unconsciously, a woman's body.  I never considered that someone might watch me; I never thought I could be hunted.<br /><br />But I was. So I ran, I dodged. I knew instinctively what the man wanted and what he would do though I couldn't give it a name. I darted up a side road betting he wouldn't know the road ended in abrupt overhang. From there, it was a minute to my parent's door.  I ran, not looking back as a leering man I didn't know, yelled in frustration as I fled. I didn't hear what he said but something, perhaps innocence was ended.  A dark thing no one had thought to describe for me, narrowly missed taking me with it.<br /><br />When I reached my family living room, my mother noticed that I was pale and out of breath. She queried me, but I couldn't answer. I had no words, even as my heart hammered in my chest.<br /><br />If you haven't read \\"The Lovely Bones\\", if you wonder whether the book is just another sell-out to the macabre industry that merits \\"true crime\\" and the terror of serial-killers, think again. Susie Salmon's voice is authentic, spare and unsparingly true. I needed to hear it.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a work of sublime compassion. Susie  speaks after her precipitous murder causes her innocence to float untethered through an oddly familiar heaven. She tells her story and the story of her surviving family but remains surprisingly untraumatized.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones asks (indirectly) why girls on the cusp of maturity must endure what they do.  How we can tolerate the sexualization and summary disposal of innocence?<br /><br />I ask, because I don't have answers. I recount my experience to highlight the jarring truth of \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" Though fictional, the book portrays the reality of a subliminal monster hiding behind suburban facade. Reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is to discover a victim's clear perspective, which is redemptive, not victimizing. Though innocence be lost, purity is surely made of harder stuff. (This Susie Salmon saw her daughter learn karate.)remains surprisingly untraumatized.      The Lovely Bones asks (indirectly) why girls on the cusp of maturity must endure what they do.

B000784WMW|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. I saw it not long after I first read the book and was captivated. The miniseries has been the only way to go for other such classics as Pride and Prejudice, and Vanity Fair. There is only so much of a novel that can be captured in a 2 hour movie and most of the details are left on the cutting room floor. <br /> <br />This is not your normal romantic story!!!! If you are looking for the warm fuzzies of a romantic comedy this is not your movie. For those true Bronte fans this is the show to watch!!!!
B0002DB52M|5.0|I'm a fan of Von Trier's movies without really knowing why. I'm not sure what Von Trier intended with this film. I appreciate it, though, as a comedy--but one in which you probably won't find the humor of until after the film is over and you reflect on it. Actually, it may be the best comedy of its year. As such, it's probably best not to take its views TOO seriously (which I can't say for all of Von Trier's films). If this sounds appealing to you, check out the movie. Also, like all of Von Trier's films, avoid the reviews. Von Trier films thrive on the element of surprise. Even the review that Amazon provides gives too much of the plot away.
B000005RMY|5.0|I distinctly remember listening to this cd in a store in Gothenburg in the summer of 1992.I had just turned 18 a month or so ago and I thouhgt it was astounding. I had never heard anything like it. So untamed and out of control and very cutting edge and different. Even though I do not dress like that anymore and my palate has grown considerably I still consider it to be a grand album with amazing tracks such as the extended temple of love, heartland and 1969. The book-let is great with all the images of the the singles and eps. The story written by Eldritch is hillarious and inteligent at the same time. This is a very well done compilation from the very intriguing mind of a certain Andrew Eldritch.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Like The Smiths, The Pixies never made a bad record.  They may have made a few that didn't live up to the standards of their best albums, but the lesser efforts by either band (eg, \\"Meat Is Murder\\", \\"Trompe Le Monde\\") could have been any other band's greatest masterpiece.  During the brief but amazing careers, neither band ever really had anything to prove.  Except, perhaps, that they could deliver on the promise of their initial offering.  While The Smiths second \\"proper\\" album may have slipped a bit from their debut (even though their second actual release didn't), The Pixies surged full-speed ahead with \\"Surfer Rosa\\", the full-length follow-up to their debut EP \\"Come On Pilgrim\\". (One then can't help but wonder, could the band follow up on a masterpiece? I think that we all know the answer to that one.)<br /><br />\\"Surfer Rosa\\", all 33 minutes of it, is overstuffed with everything that made The Pixies creepy, unpredictable, and impossible to resist.  The guitars are sometimes chainsaws, sometimes lasers, and sometimes surfboards.  (Plus, there is that cool distorted James Brown riff in \\"Bone Machine\\", and the beginning of \\"Something Against You\\" sounds like a game show theme.)  Frank Black's vocals are alternately shrieking and pensive, while Kim Deal's are a winsome counterpoint, and the lyrics are always at least a bit obscure, no matter who is singing them.  Finally, David Lovering's thunderous drumming gives the songs an earthquake-like quality.<br /><br />For all the truth that there is to how modern and groundbreaking The Pixies were, The Velvet Underground and especially The Stooges are the most obvious influences on this record .  But as I said in a previous review (of The Strokes' \\"Is This It\\"), rock's greatest bands usually combine elements of the music that came before them, and breathe new life into it.  Nowhere is The Pixies' ability to do this more obvious than on \\"Vamos\\", which answers the question of what a jam session between The Velvets and The Stooges would sound like (assuming, of course,  that either Lou Reed or Iggy Pop could speak Spanish).  Iggy Pop screams are all over the record - \\"Bone Machine\\", \\"Something Against You\\", \\"River Euphrates\\",  \\"Tony's Theme\\", etc.  And while there is genuine beauty in the mess of this music, one cannot help but be struck by the creepy lyrics.  Three of the first four songs make some reference to bones, usually broken ones.  Moreover, strange sexual references are also sprinkled throughout the record, eg, \\"I miss your kissin' and I miss your head\\", \\"He bought me a soda and tried to molest me in the parking lot\\", \\"There was this boy who had two children with his sisters\\", \\"We'll have our sons, they'll all be well hung\\". (Considering this, the name of their 1989 tour - \\"Sex and Death\\" - comes as less of a surprise.)<br /><br />Like The Velvet Underground, The Pixies had their abrasive and softer sides, and were able to display both on a single record, and often within a single song.  On \\"Surfer Rosa\\", the softer - but equally cryptic - side is evident in the pensive \\"Where Is My Mind?\\", the T. Rex-ish \\"Cactus\\", and Kim Deal's delectable song \\"Gigantic\\", an innocuous-sounding song about voyeurism.  \\"Gigantic\\" always comes as a bit of a welcome relief, as Kim Deal's voice is beautiful and the song is so damn singable.  It is every bit as significant to the album's quality as any of Frank Black's songs.  (It's too bad that his unwillingness to record her songs lead to their acrimonious breakup, but he probably couldn't help but feel a bit threatened.  And Frank Black doesn't seem like the type of person you want to piss off.)<br /><br />From the tempo-defying opener to almost the very end, \\"Surfer Rosa\\" storms through your speakers like an aural blitzkrieg.  I say \\"almost\\" because the final song, \\"Brick Is Red\\", is practically a throwaway, but it at least gives the listener the chance to catch his/her breath.  This is probably one of the Top 5 American albums of the 80s, yet is inexplicably excluded - as are all Pixies albums - from MOJO's book of the greatest albums of all time. This has been partially remedied in the most recent editon with the inclusion of \\"Doolittle\\", but it certainly didn't have to be one or the other, so the continued absence of \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is still inexplicable.<br /><br />All the same, it is hard to go wrong with any Pixies record.  This happens to be the one that I like the best, and I highly recommend to, well, anyone who hasn't heard it.as are all Pixies albums - from MOJO's book of the greatest albums of all time.

B0007Y4USW|5.0|Ok, let's all breath a sigh of relief that Mariah is back!  This album brings back the mult-octave range that we fell in love with when we first met her.  The songs are all personal and deliver on beats, lyrics, and the overall good sensation when she breaks in to harmony and ad libs. <br /> <br />Of course, the song that's making the club rounds, \\"Like That\\", is enough to get the attention of any cynic who may have dismissed her.  I am forever in love with, \\"Shake It Off\\", because she delivers not only on the vocals in its sheer sassiness of a woman leaving a goodbye message on a cell to a cheatin lover, but the beat is too infectious not to shake your tail feather to. <br /> <br />Now, you know she listed the top notch producers, and they didn't fail to deliver. The Neptunes touch can be felt on, \\"Say Somthin'\\", and Jermaine Dupri vibe is on, \\"Get Your Number\\", which he also laid some tight vocals on also. <br /> <br />She came back with determination on the ballads. \\"We Belong Together\\", which is in heavy roatation now, is a timeless classic to all those who have let someone go who was the best thing to happen to you since CSI.  My favorites are, \\"Mine Again, which harkens back to the 70s in its vibe, and, \\"Circles\\", for its storytelling lyrics. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is destined to become a classic. Thanks Mimi for bringing us \\"The Voice\\", we fell in love with. <br /> <br />Norris <br /> <br />
630521610X|5.0|All horror movies are the same old predictable thing right?  They're all about the blood and gore and horny teenagers right?  Well, Scream doesn't disprove that, but it does manage one thing: to make fun of the horror movie genre while at the same time being a horror movie itself!<br /><br />Scream, I'm sure you all know, is one of the movies that redefined the horror genre.  Still bloody and gory (and sorry to say but too much blood and guts ruin the scare of the movie), but the way the film is crafted is beyond genius.<br /><br />A group of teens who are being chased by a killer don't realize they're in a horror movie!  In short, it's a cliched horror film in which the main characters are a bunch of teenagers getting killed.  But there's more, these are teens who know the secrets to surviving through a horror film.  From the rules of \\"Don't have sex\\" to \\"Don't say, 'I'll be right back'.\\"<br /><br />Yet \\"Scream\\" manages to break the rules.  The Killer also knows the rules of a horror movie, and at the same time those who seem to follow the rules are the ones who seem to get it the worst.  There's also a very clever twist at the end, and while it gets old to see it, the way \\"Scream\\" pulled it off is better than most other films.<br /><br />However, I'll have to say this.  \\"Scream\\" is in-fact overrated as a horror film.  It IS a genius film by making fun of the horror genre as well as being a part of it, but it's not scary.  I mean come on, this is Wes Craven, meaning nothing is really scary, there's just going to be a lot of blood and gore.  Who gets scared by blood and gore?  Really, it ruins most of the creepy parts and it quickly looses its scary motive and becomes the movie about guessing who's going to die next.<br /><br />\\"Scream\\" is good, but again, it's ruined by too much blood that just isn't needed.  Horror movies are always better when they don't need to be hack and slash.  Unfortunately, that's what \\"Scream\\" is.  A slasher film.<br /><br />See it though, you'll be quite surprised at how good the movie is.  It somehow redefined the horror genre, but it'll never hit the mark that \\"The Sixth Sense\\" left./> <br />See it though, you'll be quite surprised at how good the movie is.

B00005JNRB|4.0|The movie SAHARA proves on indisputable fact. Most reviewers would not know entertainment if it came along and bonked them on the head. The movie, based on the novel of the same name, is high-standard entertainment that has enough drama, humor and good natured fun to fill a couple of movies. It also avoids being pretentious unlike some other big budget movies I could mention.<br /><br />This movie was unfairly targeted as an Indiana Jones clone. Sure the two have obvious comparisons - both searching for historic treasure - but the reviewers fail to comprehend that Cussler was writing Dirk Pitt novels over a decade before Harrison Ford donned the fedora and cracked the whip in 1981's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.<br /><br />Pitt (and sidekick) Al Giodino are modern-day adventurers whose quest to explore the deep oceans often lead them into high adventure against improbable villains. Here, the two search for a civil-era Confederate iron-clad that Pitt firmly believes is in Africa. Of course everyone around him scoffs at the notion, but Pitts belief is further reinforced when he discovers a coin from the ship.<br /><br />Joining Matthew Conaughey and Steve Zahn (as Pitt and Giordino respectively) is Penelope Cruz as a World Health Organization scientist out to investigate a mysterious plague - in a role which Cussler nominated Selma Hayek for. I have always found Cruz somewhat annoying in her other roles, but here she was actually a very appealing heroine.<br /><br />The three take on a multi-millionaire industrialist and a two-bit African dictator and I found the journey of getting to the climactic confrontation to be highly entertaining.<br /><br />I'm personally hoping to see one of Cussler's other novels (Night Probe) make it to the screen. That always seemed to me to be the most cinematic of the adventures and hopefully McConaughey and team get to film that one.<br /><br />There are a number of differences between the filmed version of SAHARA and the Cussler book:<br /><br />o In the movie Pitt is an ex-Navy Seal. In the novels, Pitt is a Major in the Air Force (technically, he is still on staff, but is \\"on loan\\" to Admiral Sandecker to work at NUMA).<br /><br />o Dirk and Al are no longer former Air Force officers, on loan to NUMA as marine engineers/scientists. They are now ex-Navy SEALs who work for NUMA as treasure hunters. Ruins their credibility a bit, I think.<br /><br />o NUMA is no longer a massive government agency dedicated to the preservation of lost nautical craft or concerned about the aquatic environment. It is a private-run organization dedicated to locating treasure and archeologic finds in aquatic areas. However there are hints at the end of the movie that NUMA may become more tied to the government.<br /><br />o In the novel, Sahara begins for our heroes when they are confronted with the threat of the accelerated red tide. Along the way, they find out about the legend of a lost Confederate ironclad. In the movie, Dirk is, right off the bat, dedicated to finding the ironclad, giving him more the image of a shallow treasure hunter. It is during his search for the ship that he helps Eva Rojas in her search for the cause of the poisoned water and the accelerated red tide.<br /><br />o The Rudi Gunn of the novels is Sandecker's enigmatic right-hand man. I say enigmatic because he is short, nerdy-looking, and appears rather unintimidating. However, he is a Naval officer who had served under Sandecker, and is EXTREMELY capable of handling himself in rough situations, holding his own with Dirk and Al. The film's Rudi is just a scientist, extremely nerdy, with no military experience.<br /><br />o The humor is a little more dumbed down, I thought. There were several instances where Al acted quite a bit like...well, Steve Zahn.x-Navy Seal.

B00008YZYM|5.0|Before she was the famous super sex-symbol that she has blossomed into, Lindsay Lohan was first introduced to movie audiences in this light hearted 1998 remake of the Disney classic.<br />Let me preface this review by saying that I saw this version first before I caught the remake. As I understand it that is critical to the appreciation of this movie - ie you'll prefer  whichever version you saw first<br />I really loved this movie, it contained just enough light touches and humor without getting in the way of the character interplay. The premise is familiar to most by now and so I will not go into specifics, in this update we find an English girl and a Californian girl meeting at a New England summer camp and, after some humorous hijinks becoming friends and then realizing they are twins.<br />I saw this about four times in the movie theater and seem to end up drawm back to it about once a week. It joins the ranks of a very few select number of movies (1980s FLASH GORDON and NORTH SEA HIJACK come to mind) that I can watch over and over again.<br />I find it funny, chatming, delightful and one of those movies that gives me those nice warm fuzzy feelings all over. It also features a pretty good toe-tapping soundtrack which manages to combine modern hits (for 1998 at least) with the tried and true classics.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone.

B00000K0E5|4.0|After a six-year absence it was with breathless excitement that I sat there in a darkened movie theater at the Mall of America in Minnesota waiting for that familiar gunbarrel sequence focusing on one of my favorite television and movie actors.<br />What followed was a great couple of hours with the best femme fatale in a 007 movie since 1983s Fatima  Blush. Famke Janssen was so much fun as Xenia that she dominated the screen in every scene in which she appeared.<br />Brosnan throws himself into the role with vigor. With something definitely to prove after being denied the role eight years earlier he gives a rousing and thoroughly entertaining performance as the British secret agent. Brosnan never looked better and it's only a shame that he failed to live up to his initial promise with his subsequent movies.<br />Judi Dench gives the series, and all the tired old-boy M-scenes of previous movies, a shot in the arm with a fresh take on the part of Bond's boss. The dialogue was crisp and crackling and although the novelty has since worn off back in 1995 it was a welcome change.<br />One of my favorite young British actors Sean Bean (of the Sharpe series and `Stormy Monday') appeared as the main villain. It was great to finally get a good, involving fight back in the 007 movies as the two agents threw themselves around the lofty inclines of a radio transmitter.<br />Which brings me to - secret villains base. It's not quite a hollowed out volcano, but hiding the transmitter under a lake was a nice touch. The actual location has since appeared in a number of movies and television shows but at the time of GOLDENEYE's release it was exciting to see a return to the world of secret villains super-lairs.<br />One element I really liked was the score from Eric Serra. It was fresh, different and toe tapping good. Serra thankfully used the James Bond Theme sparingly (unlike some idiots I could mention) and I really enjoyed it.<br />Overall a good, solid James Bond movie that allowed the viewer to have a fun, entertaing ride along with the actors.<br />This DVD was released with a nice selection of bonus features that includes an engagingly amiable and entertaining audio commentary between Michael Wilson and Director Martin Campbell.

If she asks me about it, I usually say \\"I didn't feel a great connection.\\" Not every guy is a complete jerk, without the ability to be honest. I thought the fake letters in this book were purely entertainment, and they were funny too, thanks to Behrendt's humor, so it's not a total loss. It's a good book to read in a night just to see how complete jerks act, cold, indifferent, unavailable and dishonest. The whole book could have been a running list of excuses some guys give on one sheet of paper. I was scratching my head wondering where \\"The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys\\" part of the book was. I looked on every page, and couldn't find it. That's because it's not in the book.  <br />The title is seriously misleading. It should have been: \\"He's Just Not That Into You: A One Sheet List of His Excuses.\\" <br />Greg Behrendt is a great, funny writer, so it's nothing personal. There's just nothing in here to really understand guys.

0920668364|5.0|I love this book! <br />I at first thought that it was creepy but then one night I was holding my 3 year old daughter in the hospital waiting for the doctor to come and was trying to think of stories to tell her and was running out (if you have a child and have ever needed to take them to the emergency room while they are sick you know how long a wait that can be), when I thought of this story. I was amazed that remembered most of it by heart and all I did was change \\"he\\" to \\"she\\" and told it to her. Both she and I felt this calm as I rockd her and sang \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you always, For as long as I live my baby you'll be.\\" <br />Now it's become an every night ritual and if I'm busy and her step-daddy is putting her to bed she ask for it and will wait to go to sleep until I get there.  <br />I understand the book, what it shows is that no matter where my baby goes or how old she gets I'll always love her and as I say my prayers everynight I mentally will be still rocking her and letting her know how much I love her. <br />

0780625129|5.0|I won't go over the same ground covered so well by the other reviewers, but I want to add one observation: Racism is not really the central theme of this movie. It is the vehicle for showing the true theme, that blaming \\"them\\" (whoever \\"them\\" happens to be) for our problems leads to misery and destruction.  <br /> <br />Derek's redemption is only in part demonstrated by his release of hatred and anger. In my opinion, the true redemption occurs when he takes full responsibility for his life and how his decisions and actions influence those around him. In the end, Derek completes the transition from blind hatred (\\"They cause all our troubles!\\") to questioning (\\"What have I done to make my life better?\\") to realization (\\"My god, what have I done?\\"). It's all about personal, individual responsibility questioning, then rising above, the herd mentality.
B0000025P9|5.0|I first heard 'Africa' on the radio when it charted in 1983 - almost a year after this album was released, but I somehow didn't get around to buying this album until 10 years ago.  Since then, it has been a favourite of mine and one of my most-played records of all time. <br /> <br />I decided to write a review after reading a series of reviews by people who either are brain-dead or have cloth ears.  This album is brilliant.  In fact it is probably the best AOR album of all time.  1982 was a time when the charts were dominated mostly by the new-romantic movement, but there was also this. <br /> <br />The first side starts well with 'Rosanna', 'Make Believe' and the classic ballad 'I Won't Hold You Back', and then runs out of steam a bit as 'Good For You' and 'Its a Feeling' are not as good as the rest of the album.  Side two is much better.  'Lovers in the Night' and 'We Made It' are quite high energy tracks with Steve Lukather and Jeff Porcaro on top form, 'Waiting for Your Love' is good too, and side two ends with the massive hit 'Africa'. <br /> <br />Toto played as session musicians on many albums around this time (most notably on 'Thriller' shortly after this one was released), but out of their own catalogue this was their best.

0553573403|5.0|For many people, myself included, stories of knights and ladies, wizards and spells, dragons and wolves, are not the sort of thing that they would ever imagine themselves carrying to the checkout counter of a bookstore. And mostly, this is for good reason - virtually all fantasy is clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; , with bad writing and predictable stories. Using the word \\"fantasy\\" for most of these books is misleading, since they all follow the same few formulas to such an extent that virtually no imagination is required either to read or write them.<br /><br />So it comes as a great pleasure to be able to recommend a fantasy book that is satisfying to those of us who do not complain (as some reviewers have) when there is an insufficiency of wizards, dragons and spells.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones (and its sequels) contains many of the same elements of classic genre fantasies - a pseudo-medieval world of Lords and Ladies, knights, big swords, and warring kingdoms, with a (thankfully) small element of dragons and spells. However, where it differs is the realism of the politics, the motivation of the characters, and the scope and range of the story, and the sheer entertainment value of it all. The politics and stories are often complicated, yet Martin writes so well that, despite the many stories and perspectives, it is always absolutely clear what is happening. Similarly, Martin's characterisation could be used as a textbook for genre novels (including fantasy, science fiction, spy novels, thrillers). No, Martin's characters do not show the complexity and subtle ranges of emotions and psychology of characters in a Tolstoy or Henry James novel, but compared to other books of this kind, Martin creates vivid, psychologically persuasive characters whose difference are well-portrayed and convincing. Similarly, his prose is not particularly elegant, but then we don't read this type of book for Proustian sentences; Martin's writing style is functional and clear, and perfectly suited to his story.<br /><br />Not surprisingly for a book of this size (and this is especially true of its sequels), there are occasional longueurs, and certainly many moments of silliness (and the books could do with a few less tedious descriptions of jousting, and I don't need to be told the colour of every character's doublet), but these are not as frequent as you might expect, and don't prevent this story from being absolutely cracking entertainment and a riveting read.<br /><br />As an aside, I find it amusing that much of the novel is exactly what Cervantes was satirising in Don Quixote nearly five hundred years ago, in describing the Don whose brains had been addled by reading too many heroic fantasies of brave knights and fair maidens. Don Quixote could well have been written with this book in mind, and it shows that nothing has changed in five hundred years, either in the books being written or the tastes of readers.<br /><br />As a further aside, you will need a new vocabulary to read this book: a working knowledge of the meanings of \\"barbican\\", \\"portcullis\\", \\"dirk\\", \\"hauberk\\", etc will definitely help.<br /><br />Read these books. Don't expect Tolstoy, but do expect to cancel appointments and stay at home on weekends to finish them because they're great entertainment.ted to his story. <br /> <br />Not surprisingly for a book of this size (and this is especially true of its sequels), there are occasional longueurs, and certainly many moments of silliness (and the books could do with a few less tedious descriptions of jousting, and I don't need to be told the colour of every character's doublet), but these are not as frequent as you might expect, and don't prevent this story from being absolutely cracking entertainment and a riveting read. <br /> <br />As an aside, I find it amusing that much of the novel is exactly what Cervantes was satirising in Don Quixote nearly five hundred years ago, in describing the Don whose brains had been addled by reading too many heroic fantasies of brave knights and fair maidens.

B00005JNQ8|4.0|This is a pretty good thriller that can be a little long winded at times, but still managed to keep my interest throughout the two hour running time. The acting by Nicole Kidman is some of the best she has done in quite some time (a great comeback after the horrible \\"Stepford Wives\\" remake) and Sean Penn takes a more laid back approach to his character here and it works to his benefit. It's hard to describe this movie without giving anything away (it has a pretty standard political assassination plot), but if you are the mood for a political thriller which focuses on the character drama just as much as the thriller aspect, you might enjoy this one. I don't regret seeing it in theater, but I kind of wish I waited to see this one on DVD.
B00005A8MA|5.0|When John Mayall initially started out to make this recording, he didn't realize that he was attempting the near impossible. He traveled the world with master tapes in hand, determined to succeed. What most of his fans didn't realize is that the majority of the musicians were not playing together. In fact, on some of the tracks, the musicians didn't even know each other. Today we are fortunate to hear most of the tracks that Mayall recorded and produced. Together with his long time drummer, Joe Yuele, we can once again appreciate this Herculean task. The list of great tracks is endless. My favorites are \\"Blue Fox\\" and the remix of \\"Boogie Alert.\\" Yet I must admit that the remix of \\"Home Again\\" is something of a must. Mayall and Clapton are once again at their creative best. Your Mayall collection is not complete without the addition of \\"Back to the Roots.\\"
B00005YUNY|5.0|I have just watched this and decided to write a review.  I have been going to Yes concerts since the late seventies.  They never disappoint and this DVD is no exception.  The picture and sound quality are both excellent.  If you are a Yes fan and are thinking about getting a DVD of one of their concerts, this is the one.  It was recorded in 2001 in Amsterdam and has a lot of their great songs on it as well as a few new ones.  There is a symphony orchestra backing them up that only adds to the sound.  It is two and a half hours long and is all concert footage that is very well edited.  My favorite song is \\"And You and I\\" and they do it very well here.  Jon Anderson's voice is as strong as ever.  My advice - buy it, put it on, turn the lights down and crank it up!  You'll feel like you're there.
B000002HRE|3.0|People are always comparing this album to Metallica's old metal stuff.  To me, if you just look at it on it's own merit, it's a great straight ahead rockin' album.  There are some really great songs here like Fuel, The Memory Remains and Fixxxer, and it's sure heavier and more real than some of those nu-metal and teen angst 182-something bands out there.  Maybe we should be grateful that Metallica doesn't do the same thing album after album.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have to admit I have never been a fan of Mariah's music, except for fantasy But, with The Emancipation Of MImi, Mariah has definitely gotten my attention.  All the tracks are perfectly done.  Vocals are tremendously great.  Mariah is definetely back.  Congratulations Mimi, you gave us a great album.  I trully recommend this record even if youre not a mariah fan, buy it and listen to it I'm pretty sure youre going to love this record, even if you have to hide it from other people (that is if you dont want to admit youre listening to a mariah album).  Overall a 5 Star debut. <br />
B000002AZ8|4.0|Pearl Jam - Vitalogy (1994)<br /><br />I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who claim this is their favorite PJ album. I find it more challenging and not as immediately likeable as their first two (TEN and VS.), but that seems to be part of the appeal for some.<br /><br />The strange, sort of jazzy noodling that introduces the first song is appropriate as it exemplifies the \\"anything goes\\" feel of this album. A somewhat disjointed affair with some strange tangents, VITALOGY none-the-less contains many very good songs and a few of their best.<br /><br />My impressions:<br /><br />\\"Last Exit\\" - kicks the album off on a strong note with a powerful, insistent beat. Soaring chorus from Eddie Vedder. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Spin the Black Circle\\" - cranks the rock meter up even higher. This is one of PJ's thrashiest songs with Vedder in scream/sing mode (as he is on much of this album). Rocks hard! ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Not for You\\" - a more even tempo compared to \\"Spin\\" but still very powerful. Vedder gets pretty emotional and cusses but no need for a parental advisory note since this isn't a rap album (please note the sarcasm) ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Tremor Christ\\" - rather strange song with wavering guitars. Seems to be about maintaining faith despite everything that goes against it. \\"Believe in lies/ To get by . . .\\" ****<br /><br />\\"Nothingman\\" - Pearl Jam classic - tragic and gorgeous. *****<br /><br />\\"Whipping\\" - another thrashy rocker, supposedly a protest against violent abortion protesters. ****<br /><br />\\"Pry, To\\" - brief, funky little interlude. ***<br /><br />\\"Corduroy\\" - another PJ classic. Very distinctive guitars, very passionate song. Very exciting live - typically played harder and faster. *****<br /><br />\\"Bugs\\" - pretty awful to be perfectly honest. I don't care much for accordion to begin with and I certainly don't care for this rudimentary accordian riff played over and over. Gets an extra point for being totally off the beaten path. **<br /><br />\\"Satan's Bed\\" - Pretty basic riff rock that actually sounds really cool. The chorus is great. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Aye Davinita\\" - kind of a hypnotic mantra or chant. Actually quite pretty. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Immortality\\" - excellent song with intriguing lyrics. Other reviewers have mentioned it's dedicated to Kurt Cobain. It definitely seems to be about suicide. The reviewer right after me claims it was written before Kurt's suicide in which case the song is eerily prophetic. *****<br /><br />\\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\" - although I actually really get into experimental music, I can't say I really like this bizarre, atmospheric piece loaded with feedback. It drones on for quite a while, eventually resembling a song to a certain extent with wild drums and a simple bass line. The disembodied voices are quite disturbing. Other reviewers inform me they belong to mental patients. If they really are mental patients, some might find this piece to be exploitative, but I ultimately trust Pearl Jam's intentions to be noble. Vedder has always been a voice for the disenfranchised. I gotta wonder about the reviewer who claimed this to be one of his/her favorite songs, though. ***ed\\" - Pretty basic riff rock that actually sounds really cool.

1563898586|5.0|If you're a fan of Victorian genre literature and have any interest in comics, this will very probably appeal to you. I'm a very casual comics reader, never buying any but borrowing anything that's at the library except for manga or pure superhero fare. As for 19th-century genre lit, when I was a child, I read some Stoker, H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and the like. All that said, this is a highly entertaining work, probably the most purely enjoyable trade comic volume I've encountered.<br /><br />The concept is pretty outstanding: Moore's taken public-domain \\"heroes\\" of the 19th-century and remixed them into a classic superhero team in the spirit of Justice League, X-Men, etc. They are tossed into a steampunk version of Victorian London to do battle with a nefarious villain from the same era of genre-lit. In this volume, the head of the British Secret Service orders his minion (Campion Bond), to assemble a team for a secret mission. He starts with Ms. Murray (the widowed wife of Mr. Harker from Dracula), who drags the gaunt former adventurer Allan Quartermain (the intrepid explorer of H. Rider Haggard's stories) from the depths of a Cairo opium den. They are spirited to safety by H.G. Wells' incomparable stern Sikh pirate, Captain Nemo, in his magnificent submarine technological wonder The Nautilus. Next stop, the backstreets of Paris, where a beast is terrorizing the prostitutes of the Rue Morgue. This ends up being the terrifying Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, whom they barely manage to subdue. The final stop is to the \\"Rosa Cootes' Correctional Academy for Wayward Gentlewomen\\", where a mysterious spirit has been \\"possessing\\" some of the boarders. This bizarre combination of boarding school and S&M academy is where we meet Hawley Griffin, aka The Invisible Man.<br /><br />These initial adventures do a very good job of both establishing the marvelous setting and the individual nature of the five heroes. Each is a formerly respected, now somewhat fallen member of society. When a storyteller assembles such a team of flawed misfits, the result is usually either slapstick comedy or some form of redemption. In this case redemption is the order of the day, as the team is assigned to recover a stolen container of \\"cavorite\\", a mysterious compound which makes flight possible. It seems an evil Chinese East End triad leader named Fu Manchu has stolen it in order to build a superweapon. The remaining 2/3 of the book details their attempt to infiltrate his Bond-villainesque secret base and recover the material. A major plot twist halfway through reveals yet another literary criminal mastermind at work, one that many readers will have guessed at early on. Things build to a climactic and chaotic aerial battle above London's East End, with crazy fighting kites, firebombs, and plenty of wild action.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in the book, notably an attention to detail that is head and shoulders above most graphic adventures. When Arabic and Chinese speaking characters are encountered, their dialogue is rendered in the actual script. The story and visuals are packed with 19th-century literary inside jokes that will reward repeated reading and the curious who seek out their meaning. (Alternatively, you can pick up Jess Nevins outstanding Unofficial Companion to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which decodes the inside jokes and tells you where everything came from.) This is not to imply that the book is stuffy or dull, because the writing is actually quite witty and arch -- providing you like puns, double-entendres, and other such wordplay. The artwork perfectly supports the story, as O'Neil's techno-gaslight London vibrates with energy and activity. The paneling is traditional and straightforward, as befits a retro-romp such as this, and full-page pieces teem with background activity and wit. There's a lot to look at in these pages, such as pickpockets and thieves operating in the background, or more amorous silhouettes... And when things get violent, they get very violent, as we are shown limbs getting ripped asunder, heads getting blown off, and soforth.<br /><br />This is an outstanding work, although definitely not for younger children. Without being overly sensitive, one has to also keep in mind that in keeping with the setting and origin of the characters, one of the villains is a pretty vile stereotype of an evil \\"Oriental\\". Perhaps more disturbingly, the serial rape committed by the Invisible Man is treated as a subject of humor. This latter is slightly counterbalanced by having the team led by Ms. Murray, a setup which seems improbable for the setting. However, minor caveats aside, this is a splendid work of escapist adventure that is much better than the movie made from it. There is a second volume, which finds the team battling a Martian invasion.And when things get violent, they get very violent, as we are shown limbs getting ripped asunder, heads getting blown off, and soforth. <br /> <br />This is an outstanding work, although definitely not for younger children.

0553277472|2.0|I read through some of the other reviews of this book, and found myself hard pressed to find out what the book was actually about.  Rather than discussing the plot, other reviewers like to talk about the tingly feeling this book gives them.  The reason why the other reviewers do not discuss the plot is because it is paper thin, despite the 400 page thickness of the book.  After reading the book, I am hard pressed to explain what it is about.    I realize this book is intended to be a philosophical exploration of the modern world, but I just can not see it.  The main character uses his motorcycle as his metaphor for life.  Just as things go wrong in life, motorcycles malfunction.  Each person has a unique approach to fixing the problem.  The main character's problem is his strained relationship with his son.  Together, they travel cross country via motorcycle, enduring the quirks in each other's personality and enjoying some beautiful scenery.  This story is about 30% of the book.  In the rest of the book, the main character explores fantasy/his alter ego while discussing philosophy and all of the great philosohers.  If you did not enjoy reading this type of literature in your college philosophy class, reading these passages will feel like a trip to the dentist.    While the coming of age story and father and son bonding stories are readable, I would hardly call this book \\"one of the most profound best sellers of our time\\".  One man's navel gazing is a waste of another's time.

This is a surprisingly good album amidst all of the controversy surrounding G-Unit.  Fifty spits some hotter than hot rhymes, and the beats are banging.  I'll be the first to tell you that I'm not a big fan of 50, but you have to give credit when credit is due; ladies and gentlemen it's due.  Great album, but it doesn't have enough grade A tracks to warrant a 5 star rating.  Hot list - In My Hood, Piggy Bank, Candy Shop, & Get In My Car.  Don't sleep on this album....

0670033375|3.0|This account of why societies fail, by the eminent author of the study of why societies succeed, is not nearly as logical and has major problems in tying together the discussions of failure.  The book is mainly based on environmental mismanagement and how that has led to the total collapse of such diverse societies as Easter Island, the Maya and the Anastazi.  All the accounts are accurate, fascinating and basically true, especially in the case of Easter Island.  But there are a lot of holes in this text.  For instance it tries to connect Easter Island and its overpopulation and destruction of forests with what happened in Rwanda in 1994.  Then it shows a map titled \\"conflicts in the world\\" and a map below it titled \\"environmental problems in the world\\" and both show the exact same countries.  This is just totally fabricated to prove a very weak thesis.<br /><br />What does Rwanda have to do with Easter Island.  Overpopulation destroyed them both.  But in the case of Easter Island it was deforestation that led to unsustainable population whereas in Rwanda the environment was fine, the people were misled into slaughtering each other.  One had racial issues, the other trees.  There is almost nothing in common.  Finally this book includes its first chapter on Montana and environmental problems along the Bitterroot valley.  The subconscious idea is to connect environmental issues such as mining in Montana with Easter Island and to lead the reader to say `oh my god...because of logging our country might destroy itself'.  This is so wildly moronic a connection that it leaves the reader wondering if the book, which grew out of a few lectures and had many research assistants working on it, is simply a collection of stories, with a faked thread between them.  Lastly it is important to note that this survey is far from complete.  It pocks and pans a few societies over the last 2000 years that destroyed themselves, leaving the vast majority that declined for other reasons unmentioned, since they might take away from the overall claim that environmental mismanagement leads to disaster.<br /><br />Seth J.

B0007GAERG|4.0|I don't think Carey ever needed an \\"emancipation.\\" Each album, she says she feels she's able to step out for the first time and be who she really wants to be as an artist and as a person. She said the same for \\"Rainbow,\\" \\"Glitter,\\" and \\"Charmbracelet.\\" What I felt she did with this album was take a cue from Madonna and re-invent herself. She doesn't go totally into the R&B track as she did with \\"Rainbow\\" and joins forces with some interesting people. Jennifer Lopez claimed her album was a \\"rebirth,\\" returning to the roots of her first album. I think that title fits this latest Carey effort.<br /><br />1. \\"It's Like That\\" is a good song that relies on heavy beats more than it does the conventional musical style Mariah is usually associated with. Similiar, style wise, to Snoop Dogg's \\"Drop it Like It's Hot\\" but Carey actually sings, hits high notes, and sets the tone for this CD with a song about partying and having fun. The first single.<br /><br />2. \\"We Belong Together\\" to me is one of the best Mariah Carey songs ever. Period. A beautiful song with a wonderful piano and solid percussion beat in the background that keeps the time, her voice carries a heavy tone of emotion. This song, to me, is about loving someone and perhaps realizing you haven't made the best decisions in life. The second song.<br /><br />3. \\"Shake it Off\\" is an interesting, \\"nothing is going to get me down,\\" type song. This is more of a R&B-tinged song but still sounds fresh and unique. While she does her vocal flips and such at the end of the song, she sings in a lower voice and raps a little. Even with words coming out a mile a minute, it's a fun, edgey song that seems to be a Carey fan favorite.<br /><br />4. \\"Mine Again\\" is one of her songs that shows off how high she can sing. This is another ballad, sort of middle-range tempo. I think the highlight of this song has to be her ability to still hit the high notes that she was known for back in the '90s.<br /><br />5. \\"Say Something feat. Snoop Dogg\\" is in my opinion of the the weaker tracks. It's an upbeat song with Snoop Dogg having a little voice over at the start and a little rap in the middle.<br /><br />6. \\"Stay the Night\\" is another high note for the CD. A song produced by Kayne West. It has the West touch - the classic song sample playing in the background - and Mariah's personal touch- wailing high notes that manage to convey hard-hitting emotion.<br /><br />7. \\"Get Your Number feat. Jermaine Dupri\\" is an okay song. It's the weakest of Jermaine Dupri's contributions to the CD, with his own voice pleading with Mariah \\"can I get your number, girl?\\" being a bit annoying and over-the-top cheesey. Mariah does a little bit of everything in this song; She hits some high notes, she does a little rapping about having \\"a house in Carpi\\" and other things in her lavish life. Still, it's listenable.<br /><br />8. \\"One and Only feat. Twista\\" is up there in the great accomplishments. You have Twista's usual fast, \\"what did he just say?\\" lyrics flying at you. It's not a fast song, but a moody, brooding type of slow R&B/Hip-Hop thing. Mariah even steps up to the bat, rapping just as fast as Twista but pulling off a great song.<br /><br />9. \\"Circles\\" is a song that sounds a little dated, but in a good way. It has the choir echoing some words, a feel-good, chippy tone to it, trumpets, horns, etc. It's a good song, doesn't completely click with me but it's far from being a bad song.<br /><br />10. \\"Your Girl\\" is short! That being said, I really got into it. I liked hearing Mariah sing about being happy because in previous releases, she sounds a bit depressed or she feels she needs to escape something from her past. Perhaps this is a sign that she feels free. She sings back-up and everything so her voice sounds as if it's tripping over itself as she coos, \\"I should be your girl...\\" It gets loud and triumphant in sound in the middle. I wish it was longer but with what's there, it's great.<br /><br />11. \\"I Wish You Knew\\" reminds me of something Alicia Keys would do. It opens with in-track applause, as if it's taken from a live concert. In a Keys-fashion, she speaks at the start in a low tone as Keys does, then she gets into the song. Her speaking is interesting, as if you're getting into her head, and yet you're still left with her singing the usual R&B ballad about not really having the love she wants.<br /><br />12. \\"To the Floor feat. Nelly\\" to me isn't all that bad. It's meant to be a dancey track, with Nelly, similar to Dupri in \\"Get Your Number,\\" at times interupts a decent song with his cheesey sound while screaming out, \\"to the floor, everybody to the floor!\\" I personally prefer this over the Snoop Dogg collab that's earlier in the CD though.<br /><br />13. \\"Joy Ride\\" was partly written by a 15-year old, I've heard. It's not the best song but the lyrics save song. I like how some words are repeated, how it is sort of juvenile yet is mature for it isn't just about being in love but sort of has a vulnerable, openess to it. It's a slow song that reminds me of a love poem or a sonnet being recited than an actual song.<br /><br />14. \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" has a snippet of the pastor from the church that Carey attends. This is the expected inspirational song, similar to \\"My Saving Grace\\" from \\"Charmbracelet\\" and other uplifiting, gospel-type songs from her past. It's a nice note to end on, with a choir, ending rather abruptly, but with her singing her behind off and leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />  One of the complaints I have is that this is rather short. It clocks in at a little over 50 minutes. Why not add another track or two? I guess that really wasn't her decision though but probably those in charge of her album. The import version from Japan has the tracks \\"Sprung,\\" which is rather electronica/techno in sound, and \\"Secret Love\\" which I wish was released with the U.S. version for it is a great song. The Limited Edition version, in my opinion, isn't really worth getting it. It's in a digi-pack, meaning really that instead of having the usual jewel case, the CD is kept within a cardboard container the size of a usual jewel case. Also, it comes with a limited edition poster, which is of the same image on the front of the regular CD, but all the lyrics are on the back so would you really want to hang it up if it acts as the booklet too? The limited edition doesn't come with any of the extra tracks.<br /><br /> This was close to a 5-star release. If it wasn't for the few stumbles, meaning the Snoop Dogg collabo and the \\"Get Your Number\\" Dupri moments, it would have been a near perfect CD. There are many songs that could be good singles and there really isn't a track that I would immediately skip. Which means that there really aren't any filler tracks, something a lot of CDs, such as Lopez's \\"Rebirth,\\" suffer from these days. This was the first CD since 1997's \\"Butterfly\\" to debut at #1 so really, this is the comeback Carey and her fans have been waiting for and is well-deserved. Definately worth your money and attention.<br />11. \\"I Wish You Knew\\" reminds me of something Alicia Keys would do. It opens with in-track applause, as if it's taken from a live concert.

1576751988|5.0|I recently read this book and found the advice to be very practical and easy to implement.  It read well and offers its advice in a concise and helpful format.  I would highly recommend it to others that are seeking to \\"Eat That Frog\\" or take care of your biggest, most critical task and find yourself not making the progress you would like.
B00006GO9Q|3.0|\\"In a Silent Way\\" is a pretty unbalanced record-- consisting of two sidelong tracks with a fantastic band (Wayne Shorter- sax, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul- keys, John McLaughlin- guitar, Dave Holland- bass, and Tony Williams- drum), the material represents beginnings of experimentation by Miles, full embracing of electronic instruments, and the first really concrete experiments in composition by tape splicing from products Teo Macero.  The result is both compelling and in many ways of mixed success. <br /> <br />\\"Shhh/Peaceful\\" opens and closes with what is actually a solo by Miles, but of such coherence of form and fine shaping that it sounds like it could have been composed-- in the middle, fantastic playing by McLaughlin and Shorter follow, but what really matters is the vibe-- three keyboards swirl and create this sort of haze that keeps the affair relatively low key, and yet at around 18 minutes, the piece maintains interest. <br /> <br />The second track is a bit less interesting, Zawinul's \\"In a Silent Way\\" theme is a bit lifeless and opens and closes this, but the bridge, with its driving rhythms is superb. <br /> <br />This is a man whose music is very clearly in transition-- better things would come, better things had past, but there's enough magic here to make this one worth it.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Ok, let me begin by saying I am a die-hard product of classic 70's and 80's rock and am a musician of over 20 years.  Very little music today moves me, as the musicianship and commitment to melody in today's bands has take a very drastic step backwards.  However, there are some exceptions.  Bands like Jimmy Eat World, Green Day, and My Chemical Romance have found a niche for themselves in that they really pour their hearts out into the music and do it with catchy melodies, which is somewhat of a forgotten staple in music nowadays.  Sure, not the greatest musicianship (but neither were the Ramones or Nirvana and so many countless metal bands I used to follow) but they get a free pass in my CD player for making up for it with melody and just good song writing. If being drawn to music that moves me emotionally and as the same time, makes me want to sing along, makes me a simpleton, than I guess that's what I am.  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but JEW, Green Day, and MCR are probably the only commercial rock bands I listen too nowadays. I think the problem is that many people quickly rush to judgment and associate these bands with other young and less talented bubble-gum punk bands of today like Blink 82, Simple Plan, etc. of course all the horrible rap metal stuff.  The fact that they wear make up doesn't do anything for me because at the end of the day it's about the music.  Great album, from beginning to end.
0670033375|4.0|I enjoyed this book on audio and found the subject fascinating. How societies collapse. After a while though I had to remind myself, just because the premise section of each society may have factual data presented, it doens't guarantee the author's conclusions are technichally correct. For example he states  or implies the Vikings didn't survive in so many words because they didn't \\"integrate\\" with the Inuit.\\" Perhaps if they were PC they would have had viking sensitivity training. They could have learned to eat fish and abandon cow farming. His message is when in Rome do as the Romans. IF this is the case then is that why the Pilgrims survived. They did the Pochahantas deal that saved their skins. He also lectures about environmental issues causing Rwanda's civil war. Overpopulation was the cause, not the ethnic hatred. I saw the movie. The movie didn't bring this up at all. Obviously one of two sides is wrong here. I just am not sure which one is wrong, thereby making me question how is the author so sure of his positions in this book. <br />Obviously some good food for the future here, but be careful making assumptions on ancient data. The interpretation may be wrong and biased.
068987474X|5.0|I'm not big on self-help books (especially when it comes to dating) but a few months ago, I checked this one out, just to see what the hype was all about. <br />   Boy, am I glad I did. Yes, a lot of it is very obvious, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. Unfortunately, we women tend to make a lot of excuses for men and sometimes, when you live in a city like New York, you find yourself lowering your standards - putting up with guys who don't call when they said they would, make no apologies for having two long-term girlfriends simultaneously, etc. It seems that's just the way it goes, right? Wrong. As Greg reminds us, every girl deserves better. Period.  <br />   Recently I found myself in a somewhat familiar situation. Guy who says he likes me a lot, has been admiring and dreaming about me for weeks, thinks I'm beautiful and fabulous, blah, blah, blah. So, is he actually acting like he likes me? (calling, asking me out, etc). Of course not. \\"That's just the way I am\\", \\"I went through a rough divorce,\\" \\"I date a lot of women,\\" etc, etc. In the past, I would probably bought all those excuses, accepted less than I really wanted (and deserved) and wasted a lot of time. Now, thanks to HINTIY, I walked off his life and felt a lot better - and more empowered. So thank you, Greg and Liz, for writing this book. I only have one complaint - WHY DIDN'T YOU WRITE IT SEVERAL YEARS AGO????
B00003CWL6|5.0|One of the good movie/film during the 90's period. A recommendation for those whom are interested in this genre of movie/films. Look out for some titles like Crook's work, Laurel Levor, Kenneth and Keith, Hooker's tragic loss, the fate of vignette's life, life of two women, sleeping beauty (Adult), Sexual fantasy, Sexual obsession and deviant sex lover if you can find any. Enjoy..... <br /> <br />
B00079ZACM|2.0|My review is not of the movie itself, which has always been one of my favorites and is grand, but of the cheap DVD just released by MGM.  I have been waiting for several years for a DVD of this movie and was eagerly anticipating buying it as soon as it was available.  My disappointment is based on several factors: one, the transfer is only OK, it looks much the same as the VHS version.  It's clear that no restoration or enhancement was done to create a sharp, clear DVD.  It's just a video transfer to DVD. So, one must ask why did MGM bother to do this except to cash in.  Second, whichever idiot  wrote the liner notes on the back cover obviously hasn't even seen the film.  Also, there isn't even a card on the inside listing the scenes or any information at all about the film.  In addition, the sole \\"extra\\" is the trailer. No one even took the trouble to give biographies of the actors or the producers/director.  An essay on the Kordas would have been most welcome.<br /><br />It will be a long time before I buy a DVD released by this company without reading the reviews first.  I feel like a sucker and I would advise any real movie fan to pass on this one and wait in hopes that a better one is in released in the future.  As a footnote, I would like to recommend that whoever is in charge of this stuff at MGM call up Warner Bros. or Universal for a how to lesson on releasing classics in DVD.  Maybe then they'll \\"get it.\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|It is very seldom that I listen to a CD and like it the very first time but this CD is truly the exception.  Mariah is fresh and new and this CD is the best from her thus far.  The Emancipation has just the right blend of very strong vocals mixed with fresh beats, tight lyrics and the right blend of pop funk.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Let me begin by stating that I truly look forward to David Lynch's films. I enjoy them not necessarily for what Lynch has to say, but more for HOW he says it. Its common knowledge that David Lynch's films have unquestionable style, but many question its substance (relax Lynch die-hards!). In Mulholland Drive, however, I was a bit disappointed mainly because I found Lynch's style to be a bit thin and recycled. Sure, there are many signature scenes that are viscerally engrossing and hauntingly disturbing, but generally, the film seems a bit cautious for Lynch. Since he originally wrote and filmed it as a television pilot for an ABC series, it's clear that it was necessary to pull back on his choices at that time. It's evident that the many characters and sub-plots would have been fleshed out if the pilot had been picked up, but we never do get the opportunity (and pleasure) in this film. It's quite clear when, where, and how Lynch tried to salvage it once his censorship shackles were removed, but the damage was done way back in ABC's womb. Trying to recycle this into a feature film (something that it was not intended for), is dooming it to be flawed. Even after reworking the script, reshooting scenes, and shooting new ones, it still tastes like a hot meal served up luke-warm. In spite of that, I must clarify that, for me, any meal served up by David Lynch is still more engrossing than 90% of the fare out there.<br /><br />Strong proponents of this film may point out that like in a dream, characters and scenes drop in and out, sometimes are interlaced, and don't exist in the realm of reason. This is all true, but there are so many that it fractures the film into too many nonsequiturs weakening its storyline. His characters are not as sharp and indelible as in his other films (ie: Robert Blake in \\"Lost Highway\\", Dennis Hopper in \\"Blue Velvet\\"). His themes, however, on the lack of self-realization, emotional transference, and fascination with split personalities are alive and well in this film. As always, Angelo Badalamenti's musical score perfectly compliments the emotional undercurrent of Lynch's films. The acting is over-the-top, but perfect in a Lynchian world. In particular, Naomi Watts (Betty Elms) is truly astonishing. Her character undergoes a severe transformation and Watts' performance is nothing short of remarkable.<br /><br />In its most simple state, the plot is about the search for the identity of an amnesiac woman. The film, however, is filled with subplots that twist and turn. The story mainly revolves around two women. Rita (Laura Harring) loses her memory after surviving a car crash at night on Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. Dazed and confused, she manages to find her way into a home of a stranger who has gone out of town. Enter Betty (Naomi Watts). A Hollywood actress wannabee, Betty shows up at her Aunt's home only to find Rita staying there and ultimately decides to help her find her identity.<br /><br />Notwithstanding its original television intent, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is still a unique, personal vision. It is not as dark and paranoid as \\"Lost Highway\\", nor is it as disturbing as \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Eraserhead\\", but it is still undeniably David Lynch and that alone is worth the price of admission.live and well in this film.

0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a great example of life in late 18th century England that depicts the struggles of women competing in a society dominated by men.  Her main character, Elizabeth Bennet, portrays an independent, headstrong women acting out against her duty as a woman to get married in a time where men are the dominant sex.  Her eventual love with Mr. Darcy creates a novel that is both humerous and romantic.  I highly reccomend reading this classic novel by Jane Austen.
0553802534|4.0|I am a relatively recent fan of Lisa Gardner and have been pleased by almost everything I have read so far. Alone was particularly good, and I recommend it for pure entertainment. there are a few flaws, but nothing too outrageous, and the writing is very good (except some dialogue doesn't ring true) so I can overlook it. I think Dodge is a strong character and hope she brings him back in another adventure tht doesn't stretch the bounds of credibility quite as much.

B0007OY2MG|5.0|The third season of Gilmore Girls is another superb dvd release for this first rate series. It is a season of change for both Lorelei (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel).  Rory is in her senior year at Chilton and Lorelei is look to move on from the Independence Inn to follow her dream and open up her own inn.  Rory also finds herself more and more attracted to Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and drifting away from her first love Dean (Jared Padalecki) which comes to a dramatic conclusion in the \\"They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?\\" episode.  The season opens with Lorelei dreaming she is married to Luke (Scott Patterson) and is pregnant with twins.  She is confused about her feelings toward him especially when he starts dating a young attorney Nicole (Tricia O'Kelley).  The season also finds Rory making a surprise choice (much to Lorelei's dismay) about college and the Independence Inn having a major fire.  Lauren Graham does her usual excellent job, but Alexis Bledel really shines in this season.  She adds dimensions to Rory and perfectly captures the fears and confusion about drifting away from your first love and graduating high school and leaving the comfort of your home.

B00008PC2O|1.0|I bought this version of Terminator 2 because it had an optional DVD that was in High Definition for the computer. What a waste! This WMHD high defintion DVD is so messed up. First problem I have windows media 10, well this DVD does not like windows meda 10 so I had to download a t2.patch  to correct the problem. Unforunately this does not correct the problem, but only makes things worse. This ended up messing up my CODEX for the DVD playback, in simple terms it trashed my existing DVD player. Many DVD's I have do not work now because this DVD's T2.patch corrupted everything! My DVD player now is half the time not detected by windows so when I insert a CD or DVD I get the error message no DVD player detected! If you are happy with windows XP don't use the High definition DVD, or else you might be reinstalling windows later. <br /> <br />   Ok when I finally Did get the DVD to work on my computer I was expecting jaw dropping graphics; lol here is the difference between hi-definition and the standard DVD: zilch, nada, nothing, no difference! All that effort to get this DVD to work and I discover the standard interlaced DVD looks better on my 19\\" TV. Minimum specs to play the high definition DVD are 3.0 GHZ processor, 512mb ram, 128mb video card!  Ha ha ha, that is definitely the minimum because I have 3.2ghz processor, 756mb ram, and a 128mb 6600GT Geforce card and this DVD runs like a slide show! Choppy, computer freezes, glitches, speach and video become delayed. What you really need is more like  Dual 3.6ghz processors and a 256mb 6800 Ultra Geforce card.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I just saw this movie on DVD last night  I laughed hard.  My wife did not.  I thought it was funny and fun to watch.  My wife thought it was \\"mean.\\"  I thought almost every scene was funny.  My wife was bored and kept commenting on how slow it was.  This is the magic of Napoleon Dynamite.  Either you get it or you don't.  I get it.  It has many layers of meaning.  Its deadpan delivery masks layers of emotions.  The movie happens inside of you not on the screen.  On one level or another we are all like Napoleon.  And although we are not as imobilized or socially retarded like him, we all have had our awkward moments, and our moments of triumph.  And like Napoleon, if we have his integrity, we come through it all with our PRIDE INTACT.  This is what this movie meant to me.  And besides the time machine scene made me laugh so hard it \\"killed.\\"
0385495323|5.0|I thought it got off to a bit of a slow start, but about a quarter of the way through it, it became almost impossible to put down.  The history of code makers and code breakers is very well put together with inteesting stories.  The details on the methods used to break the Enigma ciphers (finding cycles that allow automated searching for correct wheel alignments independent of the scrambling patch cables) was new to me and fascinating.  Good description of quantum techniques (which would be the ultimate win for the code makers side of the \\"arms race\\").
B0007N1AI6|2.0|Take every Priest lyric written between 1980 and 1990, combine them all together no matter if they make sense or not, and you have this album.   <br />Though for some, that may be a good thing.
0930289234|5.0|It's seriously bizarre that a comic book employing the all-too-familiar concept of super-heroes in a good vs. evil combat, -albeit one that goes more and more awry as the end approaches- can be used so effectively to convey such complex ideas.  Although a single reading will in no way suffice to get a full understanding of the intriguing story, it is enough to leave a mark. The kind of mark that gets left after reading, say, 1984 or fahrenheit 451, although any comparision would be very unfair.<br /><br />Watchmen isn't a warning of doom; its a prophecy.  however the entire story is only a carrier for an evaluation of human-kind in the present day. There are various perspectives that are presented here, mostly by way of different 1st person narratives.  But overriding all those is the writer's own view of things as they are and of things to come. People who kill aren't always villains, and this is one of the most striking things that set it apart from other conventional comic-book heroes. Also, every person(or hero) is distinctly human, with his own weakness, that is laid bare at some point in the story.<br /><br />What still surprises me is the myriad personalities that the writer was able to deal with within a single story, and to such detail. The messages aren't cryptic at all, and thus are not tough to read, but they do require some thinking to understand them.
B000005JA8|5.0|Check it out - this is pop music at its most accessible!
B000002UAC|5.0|It's impossible for me to disagree more with the people who say this is a weak album. If anything, it's one of the Fab Four's most powerful early efforts. Not all of these tracks made the Top 40. Who cares? What's important here is the quality of the music, not the popularity of it. And that's what With the Beatles gives you: quality. <br /> <br />With a track listing just bursting with jangly guitars, danceable drumbeats and youthful, vibrant voices, this album is essential to those wanting to get the feel of Beatlemania. And just so you'll know, I'm 18. I bought this album when I was 14. People who claim that modern kids wouldn't \\"get\\" this kind of music need to sit down and shut up.  <br /> <br />But back to the CD. With the Beatles contains a few of the band's popular numbers, like McCartney's \\"All My Loving,\\" but more importantly, it boasts some of their unsung (though equally impressive) early material, such as the raucous \\"It Won't Be Long,\\" the easier-going \\"Not a Second Time,\\" the fun \\"Little Child,\\" as well as the boys' inspired covers of Motown standards like \\"Please Mister Postman,\\" \\"Money\\" and \\"You Really Got a Hold on Me,\\" which hold their own well against their predecessors (and in certain cases, surpass them).  <br /> <br />If you want to understand why everyone in the '60s was always copying the Beatles, get this album. It'll do your ears good.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have been a Mariah Carey fan since her debut album was released in 1990. I've followed her career and appreciated each album she has released. We've all been on the roller coaster with her - throughout her marriage to Tommy Mottola, her divorce, the failure of Glitter and its accompanying soundtrack and her desperate attempt at a comeback with 2002's Charmbracelet. <br /> <br />Like many others, I was growing weary of all of Mariah's drama and the tired sound of her \\"whispery\\" voice. I knew that Mariah had it in her to belt out her trademark 5-octave range like she had done on all of her albums up to Butterfly. After she recorded When You Believe, with Whitney Houston, I noticed she restrained herself from singing \\"over the top\\". I think this was a response to music critics who panned Mariah for \\"showing off\\" over the years. <br /> <br />Well, Mariah has definitely showcased her voice to its fullest ability on this album and it rocks! She doesn't hold back. From the catchy opening track and first single, It's Like That to the beautiful, pleading second track and single, We Belong Together, Mariah proves once again she is a force not to be reckoned with. <br /> <br />The Emancipation of Mimi is definitely Mariah's comeback album. For those of us who have been waiting for an album that marks the \\"return of the voice\\", this is it!
B00005JNQ8|3.0|Physically beautiful, produced in a style that harkens back to the \\"big\\" movies of the 70's and 80's Sydney Pollack's (The Way We Were, The Day of the Condor) \\"The Interpreter\\" incites reactions from its audience for some of the wrong reasons. It's gorgeous to look at, it's directed to within an inch of its life, the actors look great and seem sincere and yet the experience is very much like eating Low-Carb Ice Cream: it just ain't the real thing...something is missing and that something is a decent script, which at the very least should make an honest attempt to piece together the disparate plot threads into a cohesive hole. No such luck: this script is muddled at best, incomprehensible at worst.<br />On the other hand Pollack directs a scene that is shot simultaneously on a bus, in several cars and features all the key actors that is terrifically exciting and makes you marvel at a style of film-making, both in the directing and the editing which can cause such a tremendously visceral reaction.<br />Also, on the plus side, Nicole Kidman as Sylvia Broome, a UN Interpreter with a dicey past, is so magnetic that your eyes follow her every move and when she begins to speak in KU, a made-up language of the ficticious Matobo people of Africa...you buy it hook line and sinker. Kidman once again plays the ice-queen but at least here she has a back-life that is mysterious, murky and ultimately spells trouble for all concerned.<br />Sean Penn as the Secret Service man assigned to investigate Sylvia, Tobin Keller seems to be stuck in a groove playing men who have recently lost something (21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon) or someone and are in deep despair and mourning. Here, Keller has just lost his wife 3 weeks before the film starts and he cries a lot of the time. Don't get me wrong: it's great to see this fine actor cry on the screen but Sean... do yourself a favor...do a comedy, what don't you? If  De Niro can, you can.<br />Catherine Keener does her, by now patented smart-ass, dry-witted best to add levity to the proceedings and for the most part she succeeds.<br />\\"The Interpreter\\" is a good way to spend an afternoon: it's pretty, it has good manners and it says please and thank you. I just wish it would have been less polite and kicked ass a little more.-ass, dry-witted best to add levity to the proceedings and for the most part she succeeds.  \\"The Interpreter\\" is a good way to spend an afternoon: it's pretty, it has good manners and it says please and thank you.

0375507256|5.0|I am afraid to write a review for this novel because I fear I will not do it justice.  Therefore, I'm going to avoid rehashing the plot because it has been so well described by other readers already.      This novel ranks among the top two contemporary novels I've read in the past five years.  It is fearless in its epic scope that travels across time with great audacity and perhaps, a smack of well-deserved arrogance.  I mention 'arrogance' because Mitchell displays a flexibility and stylistic quality  across the genres that I've never witnessed in a writer.  What is quite astounding is that Mitchell does not lose sight of the novel's defining core whilst showing-off his skills (I say this with great affection).  The six stories in Cloud Atlas are united fundamentally by its exploration of what civilisation entails and the humanity that is lost in its pursuit.  Each of the six stories contain a character that is exploited and a character that is the abuser - Mitchell raises the question of who the 'victim' may be as we hurdle through time in the quest for a more 'civilised' society.  Perhaps, Mitchell suggest, it is the abuser as well as the exploited.          I apologise for not going into detail regarding each character and the sextuplet of stories - I am terribly sorry for being vague. But I truly believe that this novel has to be discovered by the individual reader.  Each section is amazingly well-written, split and book-ended on either side of Zachry's story, which is the only section that begins and ends in a single unit.  Zachry's story is placed in the middle of the novel because it is central to the novel's theme, and perhaps the most explicit when conveying the issues raised.  I know many readers have said that this is their least favourite section but it was certainly my favourite for its profundity, and for Mitchell finally getting serious - the violence and exploitation seen in the sections prior to Zachry's story were largely light-hearted or so embedded in the genre (e.g. Louisa Rey's detective-thriller story) that the characters seemed almost like caricatures.  Zachry's story is the turning point for all the sections.  You begin to care about these characters, and start to take their lives and the world in which they live in seriously.      So read it - because it is entertaining, because it makes you question your beliefs about humanity, because you will learn something new about novel-writing, and about how you view history.  Moreover, it's a novel that I hope, you will want to share with everyone and discuss it - that is certainly what a good novel should make you do.  I would share it but I can't bear to part with it for now.  :)

0380778556|5.0|Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca is one of the most gothic-romantic stories of the 20th century, and is very compelling story, for all types of readers. One of the most interesting things about the story is, of course, the main character : The Second Mrs. DeWinter, who happens to not have a name present in the story.<br /><br />  The story revovles around a girl who is young mid-teens' early 20's, who works for a cold, obnixious old woman. Her life isn't really worth wild intill she meets the widower Mr. Maxiam DeWinter. The distant maxiam, who's dead first wife, Rebecca, present is still strong as ever, as if she was alive. Mr. DeWinter than marrys the naive woman, who would later in the novel, only be known as \\" The Second Mrs. DeWinter.\\" The second Mrs. DeWinter than moves into Manderlay, Mr. DeWinter's home. While there she meets the sinster Mrs. Danvers. Who seems to not get over the fact that Rebecca has died. And trys to make The Second Mrs. DeWinter's expirence as unplesant as she can.<br /><br />  I first read this book after watching the movie, and just like the phrase, the book is much better. I enjoyed how the character really didn't have a name, which adds to her personality. Her having no name makes sense, The second Mrs. DeWinter, she's mousy, navie, not very confidence, which is the opposite of Rebecca, Maxiam's first wife. I would recommend this book to 13 years or older, or people who enjoy reading, simply as that.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey regains #1 on the US Billboard Album charts.    At the moment, Mariah Carey's star shines the brightest of all her arch-rivals in music: recall Janet Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and the likes? This review does not intend to take a stab at those artists (who are talented in their own right), but let me start off by asking \\"who has the last laugh\\"?    My awareness for music started in the 90s. And you could not get past those 10 years without having at least ONE Mariah Carey CD. Just doesn't happen. As such, Mariah Carey's release of The Emancipation of Mimi is an EVENT in itself; and really, it kinda reminds me of those times, especially the period of 1995-1997 (encompassing Daydream and Butterfly), when Mariah Carey was (no comparisons intended) the Beyonce or Alicia Keys of music. Of course, one could aruge that Mariah Carey IS Mariah Carey and cannot be compared to anyone. Her voice, her music, her image and definitely, her transformation.     This review of the CD lets you in on what I, a person who might not necessarily be a die-hard Mariah Carey fan but have always taken the initiative to give her efforts a listen, have to say.    IMAGE:  The first thing that got my intention is the album cover. Black rings a bell - Daydream. Gold too - Butterfly? The image has been perfected, suits her fine. She's looking good too.    MUSIC:  We as music listeners are most concerned about this. I would say that the music leans towards the R&B inclination of Butterfly. Having thought about this, I am of the opinion that Mariah was indeed a visionary. She knew all along how she wanted her music to sound like, and 10 years ago, she left her ballad heavy songs for more urban sounding tracks and first presented it to audiences via Daydream, then more through Butterfly. Fortunately or unfortunately, Mariah's music was rather left-field (though there are some gems) on Rainbow, Glitter and then Charmbracelet. Really, those albums could be seen as experimental and transitional, something artists have to do before arriving at a 'higher level', if I may say so. Musically, people like to say that \\"She's Back\\". I beg to differ. Mariah Carey had not gone anywhere in the first place.    The music on this CD is not remarkably creative, and does not break new ground. But it is good music with very heavy beats. Nonetheless, the melody is strong, and caters to radio listeners today. Besides, the production and vocal arrangement is sleek. We are fed with urban/hip-hop/'Neptunes-produced' tracks today that the music on this CD can be readily accepted, and liked. One may question the staying power of the content on this CD 10 years from now, however. There is no One Sweet Day or Fantasy.    On the other hand, we are given \\"It's Like That\\", a signature first single from Mariah Carey's albums - catchy, upbeat, and leaving you wondering about AND wanting her album. On first listen, the song that appealed to me most was \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (a gospel, high powered, inspirational song). Powerful, emotional and soaring, it closes off the CD excellently. I would describe the other songs on this CD as being something you might have heard before, only because the beats and music sound familiar to radio staple. \\"To The Floor\\" sounds a bit like \\"I'm A Slave For You\\" (maybe due to the Neptunes trade mark beats) and Say Something sounds like the current \\"Signs by Snoop Dogg and Justin Timberlake\\" hit. So yeah, the music is likeable, though not awesome. But this doesn't mean that the music is bad - just not \\"fly straight in your face WOW\\". One exception though: \\"We Belong Together\\" is treasure.    VOICE:  Which leads me to the point of distinction - Mariah Carey's voice. WOW. Really WOW. She's got full control of it, the power, the key, the breathing, the 3 octave gliding act. No wonder this CD is marketed as the Return of the Voice. The songs that seem almost common at first is given a face lift with Mariah's voice glazing the simple melodies. This is a case of singer making the songs rather than the other way round (which we can see with, no offence, Ashlee Simpson, Hilary Duff etc.)    Mariah sings to my pure awe and marvel on \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\". Very, very good voice - perhaps at a place no one can match at this time. You can hear it, really - the experience, the time, the polishing and the emotion. This IS singing. I would think that Mariah might pick up a Grammy or two for vocal performance this time around.    VERDICT:  3 stars for songs, 5 stars for singing - averaging 4 stars. The music is R&B and Adult Contemporary. Let your ears hear singing. It is glamorous, grand, and soaring. It is everything \\"Mariah Carey\\" stands for. You HAVE to buy this CD.
0790730960|5.0|Tim Burton did a sequel to Batman, which turned out to be one of the best sequels of all the movies. Micheal Keaton returns as Batman, the dark, distant, superheo. Michelle Pfhifer plays Selina Kyle, the repressed woman, who later turns into the sexy Catwoman. Danny DeVito play the peguin, a man neglected by his parents, and decides to hatch a terrible plan and only Batman can stop him.  <br /> <br />        This time, it's christmas in Gotham, but nothing as jolly as it's suppose to be. Someone is planning attacks in Gotham city during the christmas lightening parade. And during this time, a man who looks like a peguin, who calls himself Hoswald Cobblepot, comes from the seward. He onlys wants to look for his parents, but Batman knows what he really wants to do. Selina Kyle, is a woman who works for the degrading Max Shrek ( Christoper Walken ), who is repressed and very mousy. During one time, she is murdered, and is brought back to life by cats. She than starts to have werid feelings and almost starts to act like a cat. All these people, by the end of the movie, than meet up for an explosive ending.  <br /> <br />        The movie is wonderful, the acting is great, Michelle was wonderful as the complex Selina Kyle. The music!!!! How could I forget the music! it's wonderful, Selina's theme, uses all string instruments, and it's sounds purrrfect for a cat. The movie tends to be over-looked due to it being dark, but that's it's appeal. And the whole Christmas in Gotham, adds to it. The script was written by Daniel Waters ( the same man who written Heathers ). Recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the early batmans.

Fails in the system of the Strategical Air Force Command of the United States sends orders for six B-58 bombers, equipped with nuclear ogives, to bomb Moscow. General Bogan [the actor Frank Overton], Commander of the Air Force, tries desperately to establish contact by radio with the bombers pilots, but they had been taught that once exceeded the \\"security limit\\" any order of reversion must be disrespected, because the enemy can know how to imitate the voice of the commanders and even of the president. Running against time, the president [the actor Henry Fonda], helped by Buck, an interpreter [Larry Hagman], informs to the Russian prime minister the imminent nuclear disaster. Working with the Strategical Air Force Command, the Russians send all their antiaircraft armory to knock down the American bombers. Unhappyly, an aircraft commanded by colonel Grady [Ed Binns] escapes and continues in its fatal mission. Perceiving that Moscow is doomed, the president takes then a radical decision to prevent the Third World-Wide War.<br /><br />In Time: There was a remake of \\"Fail Safe\\" produced in live with 85 minutes by CBS in 2000, directed by Stephen Frears. In this film, also in times of the Cold War, an unidentified flying object intrigues the American army that orders some bombers to investigate. When they arrive, they  discover that it was only a commercial airplane out of its route. However, a fail in the computers of the Department of Defense sends to a squadron of bombers a transmission of the codes of a nuclear attack. The orders are irreversible and indicate that the target is Moscow.

B00008S2VG|5.0|With the exception of the title track, this album is damn good. Much better than the critics made it out to be.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Much better in original Australian.  American accents used in \\"original US\\" version coupled with Australian vernacular always sounded stupid to me.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Much better than Cube 2:Hypercube, Cube Zero still falls flat in comparison to the low budget original, Cube.  The more Cube movies they try to make, the more I begin to believe that Cube was a one-trick-pony that has already had its day in the sun.<br /><br />Cube Zero is a supposed prequel to the happenings in the original Cube, showing us the observers of the victims trapped inside the cube.  One of the observers, Eric (Zachary Bennett) suddenly develops a conscious when he discovers that one of the victims is inside the cube involuntarily.  Naturally, since she is a pretty woman and a mother, Eric decides to enter the cube and rescue her.<br /><br />That's about all there is to the plot.  The dialogue is weak, stilted, and a bit repetitive, but the traps are numerous and cool.  If your only complaint with Hypercube was the lack of traps then you will like Cube Zero much better, but there is no study of human nature in this prequel as there was in the original, the one point that made Cube fascinating outside of the gory messes the traps left behind.<br /><br />My recommendation is to pick up the original Cube first, to see the best version first and to get an idea of the plot behind putting people inside the Cube, and what the Cube really is.  Then watch Hypercube and Cube Zero to judge for yourself.  My opinion, Cube is a 'Buy', Hypercube and Cube Zero are 'Rents'.  Enjoy!

This came out during an era of exploitative films such as reefer madness, and other seedy underworld pieces that were like erotic fables trying to tittilate and teach simultaneously.  I don't even want to give a breakdown as to what lies within at even the chance of throwing up a spoiler.

B000003TA2|5.0|To think this was made in 1990 is unbelievable. Sonic Youth have always interested me in some way or another. There's always been this sort of thing about them. I've only just decided to get into them and buy one of their albums, and this is it. \\"Goo\\". (I actually saw the video for \\"Kool Thing\\" on T.v, thought it was amazing, and so looked up which album the song came from..) And i must say it is totally, unbelievably, impressive. I can't stop listening to it.  <br /> <br />I still have yet to get into any of their other albums, in which i've read on Amazon that \\"Daydream Nation\\" and \\"Dirty\\", in particular, seem like really good buys, but after hearing this album i think i'm hooked. Sonic Youth's songs on this album \\"Goo\\", just keep humming around my head. And i really like Kim Gordon's singing and sort of, talking to no one it seems like, in between the verses and choruses in some songs. I think it's a totally unique approach, and really adds a sense of 'cool' to the songs. Chuck D, from rap-group \\"Public Enemy\\", also appears on the song, \\"Kool Thing\\". He only adds a few words here and there though, really. <br /> <br />From the excellent opening song \\"Dirty Boots\\", to the extremely catchy \\"Kool Thing\\", this album is straight-away, non-stop energy. \\"Mote\\" goes for 7:36 minutes, with the last 4 minutes or so being a long spiral of feedback. It's definitely one of the many highlights on this fantastic album. \\"My Friend Goo\\", is sometimes laughable. Not at the playing, but at Kim Gordon's singing and the lyrics. It's definitely, i guess, a fun track and it's also catchy. \\"Disappearer\\", \\"Mildred Pierce\\" and \\"Cinderella's Big Score\\" are sort of mid-paced songs, and i think \\"Disappearer\\" especially brings the energy of the album down a little bit, but in a very good way.  <br /> <br />\\"Scooter + Jinx\\", although only going for just over a minute, is yet another of the many highlights on this album. It sounds like mega-feedback that has a sludgey tone to it. And \\"TitaniumExpose\\" is brilliant from start to finish. This album is just a true classic, and i'm just hooked on this. Like i said, i can't stop listening to it. My favourite songs would be \\"Dirty Boots\\", \\"Tunic (Song for Karen)\\", \\"Mary-Christ\\", \\"Kool Thing\\", \\"Mote\\", \\"My Friend Goo\\", \\"Disappearer\\", \\"Scooter + Jinx\\" and \\"Titanium Expose\\". <br /> <br />This album won't leave my CD Player for a long while, and i'm happy to say that Sonic Youth have gained yet another fan in me. Now i know exactly what everyone has been raving about for so long..
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This 2004 film isn't for everybody.  It's slick and clever and requires full attention to appreciate.  When I first started watching, I wasn't prepared for this and nearly turned it off because it was a little  hard to follow.<br /><br />All that changed however, and, by the time I had been watching for fifteen minutes, I was completely engrossed.  I did a double take, sat back and relaxed and enjoyed the unfolding of this complicated story directed by Mike Nichols, based on a play by Patrick Marber.  The acting was exceptional too.  And even though the actors were easily recognizable film stars, they each portrayed their characters so well, that I soon only saw them as the people they were portraying.<br /><br />The story is set in London, where, in an early scene Natalie Portman and Jude Law fall in love.  She's a young American with dyed purple hair; he's a Brit who writes obituaries for a newspaper.  Later, he writes a book and has his photo taken by Anna, a professional photographer, played by Julia Roberts.  He's wildly attracted to her but she rejects him.  He's angry and decides to play a practical joke.  This involves the internet and a chatroom in which he writes explicit romantic notes to Clive Owens and pretends to be Anna.  This causes Anna and Clive Owens to meet and they soon become lovers.<br /><br />This just the beginning through, and the rest of the story plays out in increasingly complex and interesting ways.  These four people deceive each other, lie, tell piercingly brutal truths and suffer complex emotional pain.  There are constant surprises and turns and twists.  Each character took turns at being the one I hated.  And then things change and I was forced to re-think the scene I just saw as the film becomes faster paced as it moves along.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this film and give it one of my highest recommendations.  However, it is only for those with a sophisticated appreciation of human complexity.of human complexity.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I loved it.  Absolutely loved it!  Wonderful music.  Wonderful singers.  The lovely voice that brings Elphaba the Witch to life is unique and entrancing and I am amazed.  It was heartbreaking and humorous all at once and...I loved it. <br /> <br />If only...yes, if only the producers of this CD had bothered to put in a synopsis.  I'm a musical fan who lives in a town that doesn't get the new musicals.  We're lucky to have local productions of Oklahoma (need I say more?).  My connection to modern musical theatre is through CDs.  And it was such a disappointment to buy this soundtrack and try to figure out the story from the songs.  Some musicals, you can do that with.  This one was difficult.  I actually went on-line and found an unofficial synopsis for which I was ever grateful.  It unlocked the meaning behind these beautiful songs. <br /> <br />Also, I hear tell that one song was left off the CD to \\"preserve\\" some sort of surprise in the story.  As someone who experiences musicals through CD, I was disappointed and a bit hurt. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, beautiful music.  I can only hope that someday (probably in a town far from where I am) I will get to see it performed live.

Exactly one hundred years ago, the treasure ship \\"Elizabeth Dane\\" was horribly wrecked in a thick, errie fog under mysterious circumstances.

Starring Adrienne Barbeu in her film debut, Jamie Lee Curtis Oscar winner John Houseman and Janet Leigh The Fog waits... to creep into your soul and chill you to the bone!!!!  This is my favorite John Carpenter movie.  It used to be \\"Halloween\\" but that was before I saw \\"The Fog\\".  Once I did I changed my mind.  This was a hell of alot better than \\"Halloween\\".  My favorite part was when the survivors make a final stand against the deadly Fog in an abondened church.  They risked their lives to save others.  This film will have you on the edge of your seat from its exceptional beginning to is terrifying conclusion.  Once you hit play you won't hit stop until the very end.  This movie rocks!!!! I can't wait for the ramake.  I want to see it for 2 reasons.  1.) I loved the original.  2.) Maggie Grace is in it.  She is HOTTTT!!!!
B00024BHTC|5.0|Nightwish released their new album to a waiting world.  I believe the world went wild.  This album is not only their most orchestral, but it is by far the heaviest and most intense album to date.  \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" begins so metallic that my head almost exploded!  And then come in the orchestra followed by operatic vocals which is followed by Tarja Turunen.  And this goes on for the whole album.  My favourite track is the epic \\"Ghost Love Score\\" spanning to ten minutes in length, perfectly fusing together classical music, metal, and opera.  One of their best balads of all time is \\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" which is sung completely in Finnish.  Other highlights are \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" , \\"Nemo\\" , \\"Planet Hell\\" , and the excellent end to an album: \\"Higher than Hope.\\"  Oceanborn may still be my favourite Nightwish album, but this one is rising higher and higher and may one day (sometime soon) surpase OCeanborn, becoming my favourite Nightwish album of all time!

B000002LCI|5.0|All through high school i listened to nothing but hard metal rock. Thats what kids my age would normally listen to, either hip-hop or rock. I am huge huge huge deftones fan and i found that their lead singer was a huge fan of The Smiths and Depeche Mode. So curious as i was i downloaded some songs from both bands, The Smiths were alright but i past on them. However, once i downloaded Never Let Me Down Again i was hooked. Davids vocals is just amazing! This is my first Depeche Mode album. I didn't get the Singles albums because i am planning on getting every DM album. In Music for the Masses i found myself enjoying Never let me down Again, Strangelove, To have and to hold, Little 15, Behind the Wheel and Nothing. I heard this album is their most experimental one, so i think they did a good job at it with dark music and that deep, mellow voice of David. Depeche Mode is a great band, i wish more kids my age would listen them, because i dont want this band to die off in the future so we Depeche Modeholics should blast its music to spread it out again!!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Man, when I heard Slipknot's \\"Duality\\" played on my radio, it's clear to me that they have sold out big time. MTV has got them. TRL has got them. Now almost every people, specifically the mentally challenged and the ignorants, will listen to this utterly pathetic excuse for a band. They haven't realized how crap this band is and all the others like them. Don't get me wrong, I have never been a fan of this band. And I will discuss this argument about Nu-Metal again. Nu-Metal is NOT Metal. It is a wrongfully labeled genre marked by the media to get people to think that it is Metal. Well, news flash, this is NOT true. It is Alternative Rock with slight Metal INFLUENCES added with an X-Factor (anything that has Hip-Hop or Industrial references). Genres are defined by FACTS, NOT OPINIONS. And it is a FACT that Nu-Metal is NOT METAL. Slipknot, Korn, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, etc. are prime examples of this genre. I'm glad Nu-Metal has finally died but people nowadays sadly still listen to these bands. <br /> <br />This album exemplifies the fact that it's bad music. Most of the songs here pretentiously try to be Metal but fail miserably. \\"Duality\\", as aforementioned above, is the album's first single. It's quite unreasonably schizophrenic and lyrics are like, \\"I push my fingers into my eyes, it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache. If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!\\" Can you believe how unrealistic is that? If I ever intend to do that, I will be blind. Vermilion Pt. 2 is the second single of the album and this is pretty much your typical angsty and terrible song. Actually, ALL of the songs are terrible beyond belief. Some of them have soft parts in the vein of their music (i.e. melodic singing and acoustic guitars) but that doesn't save them from being inconsistent and typical.  <br /> <br />It's quite unbelievable that most people who have never heard Slipknot before and listen to any of their albums will think \\"this is the heaviest band in the world.\\" Infact, no. There are tons of other bands that are heavier and in all aspects, they beat Slipknot in their game fully because they have a lot more talent and consistency (for example, Death). A band with nine members is completely unnecessary and has no point. As aforementioned, there are many other heavier bands that are in fact WAY better than this band and it's just that they don't have that many members. A true band is supposed to be comprised of 3, 4, or 5 members. Any more than 5 and I know it's going to suck. And since Slipknot has more than 5 members, not only are they that bad but they are also retarded. Take a look at Rage Against The Machine. They only have four members and although they aren't really Metal, they are highly talented (for the most part, however, it is Tom Morello who has a lot of talent in the guitar and he displays it in all of the songs in all of their albums). <br /> <br />And about the person who said that anyone who listens to Heavy/Death/Black/Power/Grind/Thrash Metal are \\"posers?\\" That person is an absolute idiot and HE'S the one who is the poser. I have had enough mindless stereotyping of good bands in good genres such as Metal. I don't know what the world is coming to but this is a sad day in the music industry. Call me anything derogatory all you want or push the \\"Not Helpful\\" review anytime. You people may think I'm wrong but admit it, I'm right. I have known a lot about music. And it's just that I depreciate bad bands in a bad genre, such as Nu-Metal (again this genre isn't Metal).
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is absolutely insane.  The album offers a few ridiculously complicated beats as well as flowin' lyrics that go together like fish n' grits.  This is for real; nothin' but pure hip-hop.  A few tracks even offer a phat R&B feel.  I must've listened to the whole cd 50 times over.  The only track not worth listening to is track 6, \\"Spaceship\\" just cause the rhythm is whack.  The final track, #21 is absolutely amazing; offering 12+ minutes.  Kanye raps the beginning follwed by Kanye's \\"story\\" told by the man himself.  He lays it down literally to the hottest and most complicated beat I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Fave Trax: <br />#13: Breathe In, Breathe Out ft. Ludacris <br />#20: Family Business <br />#21: Last Call
B00005JNQ8|2.0|This movie would have recived a four star review if it were not for some obvious political slants in the movie. After watching the movie one might conclude that the U.N. is gods gift to civilization. It was laughable that this movie criticized the lack of U.S. involvement in the \\" world court \\" and yet many of the members of the U.N., if there was justice in the world, would be sitting in the same court,, as DEFENDANTS.   It is unfortunate that a decent movie must have its good name tarnished for the sake of making a political statement, albeit a foolish and ignorant one at best. Whatever happened to movies that didn't insult the viewers intelligence?

B00004XONN|2.0|What is the problem with Radiohead ? Well Radiohead fans of course, no matter what awful music this group produces people will still go out and buy it. If you think the sound is new and innovative, it's not. Aphex Twin has been making the similar kind of music for years. I think with a good record deals music like this sells, gets into major magazines and TV slots. I am not an (...)retentive person that dislike electronic music, but there is just a great deal of electronic genres out there that pushes the boundaries far more then Kid-A I suggest something like Download, Aphex Twin, Psychic TV...
0743454529|3.0|The subject matter of this book was interesting, timely, thought-provoking.  Much of the book was unrealistic, of course, but still rather engaging.  The \\"twist\\" at the end was soooo cheap, so Hollywood, it pretty much ruined the book for me.   <br /> <br />Sort of a spoiler coming up.  There was a real case over the last couple of years at Mt. Sinai in NY where a healthy brother donated his kidney to his brother.  The healthy brother died as a result of the operation to donate his kidney, and his brother lived.  If the author really felt the need to have the well sister die and the sick sister live, this would have been a far more realistic, and less manipulative, way of doing it.
B000667FN8|3.0|This cd shows that Simple Plan has progressed in their sound, and its pretty awesome. Moving away from the constraints of the so called \\"punk\\" (or pop-punk which might be an oxymoron ) music genre, and just trying to make awesome songs, they are more truer to a 'POP ROCK' catagory.<br /><br /> And that ain't bad. Practically every song could be some sort of hit or another. The songs are still catchy but with more energy and a sound that is a little more faithfull to their live performances.<br /><br />This cd captures that power pop sound that is sort of \\"uplifting\\" in a way , a sound that is reminiscent of like those good 80s songs. It shares a similar brand of energy that is kinda rare in pop and rock today. Its allmost non-existant in rock music. Except for a few outstanding musicians.<br /><br />Anyways... you wanna know if this cd is worth buying...<br /><br />If you love Simple Plan. Definatly. If you enjoy awesome creative pop rock or \\"pop punk\\" like really no other band in its \\"class\\" Ya, it is worth it, its an awesome album.<br /><br />It isnt any GREAT SUBTLE DEEP MASTERPIECE , but its not bad , its a pretty good \\"pop punk\\" cd. The best album yet by Simple Plan. They really know how to make powerfull pop rock. And they are going to get even better i think with each new cd.<br /><br />Check it out, the one word that describes this cd is AWESOME.
0385335482|4.0|Although nowhere nearly as lovable as Emma, the heroine in Can You Keep a Secret, Becky ends up redeeming herself by the end of the book. Becky is a compulsive shopper who can't afford it- and her attempts to avoid her creditors and try to earn more money are hysterically funny. The humor is what keeps the reader engaged- the character Becky becomes exasperating with all of her rationalizations and bad judgment. Despite becoming downright frustrated with Becky numerous times throughout the book, I kept reading because it was also so funny! And by the end, I was rooting for her. I'm not sure if I'll pick up Shopaholic Takes Manhattan- it looks like a rewrite of this book- but I'll certainly consider reading the later ones in the series.
B00003CXGG|2.0|I understand that a lot of today's action films feature a numerous amount of scenes that can only be achieved with the use of wires, but at least they attempt too hide it.  \\"Romeo Must Die\\" has to be one of the worst movies to ever use a wire.  The characters can often be seen holding on to a mysterious, invisible force that has the ability to control their movements and keep them in continual levitation.  THEY USED COMPUTERS TO GET RID OF THE WIRES, BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO HIDE THE GRIPPING HANDS! <br />Example: In the football scene, Jet Lee can easily be seen having his hands positioned over his head holding tightly on to what would be 2 wires.  He is also seen to effortlessly glide forward throwing kick after kick only to stop in mid air and softly land. <br />Example 2:  In one of the beginning night club fighting scenes, something happens that I would find embarrassing to put my name to.  A man is standing with his arms placed comfortably behind his back.  When he is attacked, the camera cuts to a different angel where he has a hand over his head \\"holding a wire\\". He proceeds to spin around at a horizontal angel to kick a guy, and then he effortlessly spins back around to kick someone else. <br />The movie is full of stupid crap like this. <br /> <br />In addition, the acting is bad, the story is flawed and uninteresting, and the action is questionable.  The entire movie seems as if it was set up to sell a terrible CD.  If I have to hear \\"Try Again\\" by Aaliyah one more time, I am going to give up out of spite. <br /> <br />I don't know what to say.  Buy a better movie.  Don't even consider this if you are looking for a good fighting flick.

B00005JLWN|5.0|The facial expressions of Christian Bale in the Equilibrium, are good enough to be seen and enjoyed on any small TV screen.  He just pulls you into the movie and you forget all else.  To my mind this is what great entertainment is all about.  I have watched this movie about 10 times and still I watch it when I see it on TV.  The action is excellent, Christian Bale is beautiful.  I never thought that a sci-fi movie could grab me like the Matrix trilogy did - I was wrong.

B00006LPER|5.0|Many of the reviews have provided very good plot summaries, descriptions of major scenes, etc., but none have really given a good description of how this film makes you, as the viewer, feel.  This is a pity, because here we have a powerful film that leaves you unsettled and puzzled.  The main characters are far enough askew that you cannot identify with them, but real enough that you empathize.  Moreover, while it is easy to say that the sado-masochistic themes are what makes this film troubling, there are really many layers where we are stymied in our hope for resolution and explanation.<br /><br />Clues are strewn throughout the story, bits of history that we latch on to in our quest to understand why this piano teacher is so cruel, why she withstands the abuses of her mother, why she mutilates herself.  The easy answers are unsatisfactory.  She abuses her mother as much as she is abused.  Her father went crazy, but was there something unspeakable in his past?  She is a perfectionist, but seems jealous of others.  Inevitably we attempt to use these clues to \\"solve\\" the puzzle, but our piano teacher always seems one step ahead in eluding us.  Further, this leave-a-clue/elude-resolution pattern continues through the final scene of the film, thus we cannot attempt to understand or explain it until after we have seen it in its entirety.  Watch this film with someone and you will spend hours discussing it in an attempt to understand it.  Usually, when my wife and I watch a film, we discuss how it fits in with other films, its potential importance and influence(s).  With this film our discussion never made it outside the film - we were trying to understand the characters.<br /><br />This film changes the way you look at other people.  When we are introduced to the main characters,Erika Kohut and her student Walter Klemmer, we see characteristics that remind of of others we know.  Yet as we learn more about them, we are disturbed.  We don't like what we find when we cross from the public to the personal - and by extension we begin to wonder about those around us, even how we appear to others.  That we never resolve the characters, that we never figure out how to categorize and place them, exacerbates this disruption of our view of humanity.  The real and the surreal are so tightly woven in the characters that we lose confidence in our ability to discern.  We become a bit like Walter Klemmer who is clearly flailing in his attempt to regroup after his teacher reveals a bit of her \\"real\\" self.<br /><br />While the film is disturbing, the shock comes from the characters, particularly Erika.  Her actions defy our sensibility, and while there are serious sexual overtones - if not plain sexual actions - in the film, everything is so much imbued with a sense of pain and emotional sickness that we are shocked rather than titillated.  Visually the film is beautiful, if a bit dark.  Sense of space, mood, and feeling change with ease.  This is a film that looks natural, rich, and vibrant.  The disjuncture between the public scenes and the private interior of the characters (again, primarily Erika, though Walter throws us a few curves) is part of what makes this film work so well.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this film, but with the stipulation that it is not for the weak of heart.e cross from the public to the personal - and by extension we begin to wonder about those around us, even how we appear to others.

B000068IEU|2.0|look i love most horror movies, and senless violence and gore. i dont have many morals or principals. if u want to rob a few banks, kill some cops on the way out then spend the money on hard drugs and prostitutes, sign me up. but rape is in no way entertaining or at all enjoyable to even think about. it's the worst thing to have ever disgraced the human race and that's saying a lot. i'll respect other reviews because this film was groundbreaking or whatever. if you dont like anything to do with rape your a good person and you can skip this movie.theres hundreds if not thousands of other violent disturbing movies that dont involve that level of sickness. if u like seeing young girls being raped and tourtured please do humanity a favor and kill yourself. i only gave this movie two stars because of the ending.10 minutes into this all i could think of was i hope someone kills these sick (...) before they can do that to anyone else two was more than enough.if u want something twisted and disturbibg watch audition but this movie is horrible. then again maybe i'm just a little sensitve when it comes to seeing innocent young girls suffer through an unimaginable hell no one should ever have to experience.
B000002X2B|5.0|`Blows Against the Empire' by Paul Kantner and a very large collection of major San Francisco musicians, mostly from the Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, and `Crosby, Stills, and Nash appeared in a transition between the Jefferson Airplane's last major album, `Volunteers' and the Diaspora of Airplane personnel into the groups `Hot Tuna' and `Jefferson Starship'.<br /><br />As several excellent reviews already done on this album have pointed out, this is NOT a recording by the group that would later record under the name `Jefferson Starship', centered around Kantner and Grace Slick. These reviews have also very accurately pointed out the connection between songs written for this album and the fiction of Robert A. Heinlein, especially the novel, `Methuselah's Children'. In spite of these excellent reviews, I'm prompted to write one of my own because I experienced the release of this album with all the expectations of the coming of a new Messiah, or at least a new gospel. This was the era when new music represented the cutting edge of alternate lifestyles and protest against the war in Vietnam and segregation. New recordings such as the Beatle's `Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', the Who's `Tommy', and the Rolling Stones' `Beggar's Banquet' and the Woodstock festival were epoch-making events. At least, until Altamont.<br /><br />Upon reflection, I also experience a great irony in the appropriation of Heinlein's plot to the service of a an artistic, virtual protest against the government. At the time Heinlein wrote `Methuselah's Children', before writing `Stranger in a Strange Land', his politics were much closer to those of Ayn Rand than to the ideology of Bob Dylan or Woody Guthrie. The easiest way to get some taste of this very conservative politics is to watch the movie `Starship Troopers', based pretty closely on Heinlein's novel of the same name. This is not to say Heinlein was not sensitive to the evils of oppression. Both `Methuselah's Children' and the novella `If This Goes On' are about either escape from or revolt against an oppressive prejudice. In Heinlein's starship hijacking story, the oppressed group is a generation of very long lived people who acquired this trait as a result of genetic experiments several generations before the time of the story.<br /><br />It is very worthwhile, as an aside, to note that most of Heinlein's works written up to `Stranger...' are part of a `Future History'. `Methuselah's Children', `Revolt in 2100', most of his short stories, and most of his novels written for a high school audience take place in this timeline. What is doubly ironic about Heinlein and the counterculture is that Heinlein literally predicted the culture of the `60's as what he called `The Crazy Years', an era of cultural unrest.<br /><br />Getting back to `Blows Against the Empire', I find it just a little disappointing in comparison to `Tommy', or even `Spooky Tooth's `Ceremony' in that it is really only a collection of songs, some of which are based on the SciFi story line and some of which are based on other counterculture themes. Also unlike `Tommy', there is no coherent style or feeling from one song to the next. Influences range from typical Airplane riffs to Varese to folksy tunes to the soundtrack from `Forbidden Planet'.<br /><br />This is not to suggest that there is no great emotional power in these songs. Of the major `60s groups, the Jefferson Airplane is probably second only to The Who and Bob Dylan as remembered spokesmen for the issues of young people in the 1960's which lead to a major redirection of American culture between Kennedy's assassination and Nixon's resignation. It is the Airplane's songs from `Volunteers', for example, which are used to evoke rebellion against conventional images of investment. Talk about irony!!!<br /><br />You can do a lot worse than to go back to both `Blows Against the Empire' and Heinlein's fiction to see artistic interpretations of the strains in American culture in the `50s and `60s.
B00005JMJG|2.0|I have never been so confused by a movie.  The acting itself was good but there were very slow, creeping parts and then the movie would move with such speed that you couldn't keep up and didn't understand what was happening.  I kept saying \\"what the hell is going on?\\"    <br />Carey and Winslett's roles were very different from what we have seen from them in the past.  Carey was believeably serious for a change.  He was painfully bashful and introspective and Kate was crazy, off-the-wall liberated.  She was like a balloon that has been blown up and let go, wildly fluctuating all over the place.    <br />There were some spots in the movie that were enlightening and meaningful, but they were few and far between.  The basic story could have been told in a more straightforward, less confusing way.  There were interesting, but strange camera angles and the use of very bright lights that make some grotesque scenes.  Guess I just can't get into \\"artsy\\" films.  I did not like \\"Vanilla Sky\\" either, another confusing film. <br />This is not one I would recommend because of the confusion and frustration it leaves you with.     <br />
B0007XTOKC|5.0|In the last few years there have been loads of Elvis Presley releases. Very few prove as exciting and essential as this double CD-set covering Elvis' first two post-army studio sessions in March and April 1960. These sessions not only produced a series of sterling cuts which made the original exemplary \\"Elvis Is Back\\" album, they also gave us true classics like \\"It's Now Or Never\\", \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight\\" and \\"Stuck On You\\". <br /> <br />This new \\"Elvis Is Back\\" set masterminded by the Follow That Dream team gives us the original album, the singles and all the substantial outtakes. Several of these outtakes have been released earlier (7 are released here for the first time, just as 19 false starts and workparts), but to have them all assembled often in augmented sound quality, makes the investment really worthwile. <br /> <br />This set, presented in the now characteristic tri-fold digipack the size of a 45rpm, has no less than 53 tracks, with both discs running well over 78 minutes each. Digitally transferred and mixed at the Sony Studios in New York, the sound quality is outstanding. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002WPI|5.0|this album is a must get for any true hip-hop fan. wu-tang took the whole world by storm using  kung-fu elements and mixing it with underground rap. this album has the lyrics, the beats, everything you want on an album. enter the wu-tang album got the most rotation ever in  my car and my stereo equipment. it's the best undergound album ever. my favorite is c.r.e.a.m. because cash rule everthing around me at that time.
B00005A46T|1.0|Nowdays everyone thinks Slipknot is the heaviest, most evil, most aggressive band out there but Iowa is a complete disgrace. First off, the vocals SUCK. They are not evil, brutal, heavy, just a cheesy mess. Listen to Darkthrone, Morbid Angel, or Maniac of Mayhem and those are TRUE evil, brutal vocals. Also, the instrumental work is somewhat heavy but no good rhythm, and the drumming is awful. If you want TRUE metal DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!

B000000H4V|4.0|when i listened to this for the first time long time ago, i just thought . . hmmm this album is not as heavy as the previous one. i still liked it though. <br />now when i go back to this album, now i consider this as a masterpiece. a very successful creative attempt of sepultura to widen their musical approach. it's an essential album for thrash metal fans. drum part especially is very creative with tribal tricks! i'm a thrash metal drummer myself.
B0000039QA|5.0|this is my favorite rap album period. this album just show how versatile biggie was as a mc. no other mc had a flow with great beats throughout an entire album. biggie on this double disc had something for all rap fans. the streets, the hustlers, the radio airplay, the westcoast, midwest, the dirty south and of course the east coast. this album was meant for him to take it to the next level which he did. this album in 1997 made bad boy the best rap label at that time.  r.i.p. biggie. you'll always be the kingofny rap.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album is amazing from the production to the lyrics. Fiona is a true musician. The only other female singer songwriter that can compare to her today is Tori Amos. Fiona's sophmore album is quite different from her debut. Has less piano sound and even more dark and smoky undertones on this one. She brings out her blues influence in this album. This is one of the those albums that you listen to all the way through but stand out tracks are \\"Limp, As fast as you can\\", \\"Paperbag\\", & \\"Your love\\". She  has one of the best melodic voices in todays music and it really comes out on this CD. The message on the front sleeve of CD \\"When The Pawn... is a profound statement about preserverance and tells a lot about Fiona Apple. As a talented songwriter.
0811729117|5.0|This is one of the better books I've read on WWII tank action at the tactical level.  The author addresses not only tank combat, but the whole spectrum of activity at the tactical level--the conduct of route-recon, the vital necessity, and often complete lack, of infantry support, the critical importance of maintenance and vehicle recovery operations, the impact of initiative (or lack thereof) by junior officers, etc.<br /><br />This book is also interesting because it describes many of the personal aspects of the German military:  how the author's commander refused him a jeep necessary for combat operations so that the commander could go womanizing; the relationship between the Werhmacht and SS, and the status of nobleman-officers in the army.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was his repeated harping about how post-war German society betrayed the WWII veterans (...OK, we get the picture...), and to a lesser extent, his scathing remarks about the US army and soldiers (but he is entitled to his opinion, I suppose).<br /><br />Overall, very highly recommended for those interested in tactical armored combat or the Eastern Front.
0802130208|5.0|The fact is that we New Orleanians all have known Ignatious Reillys . . . and their mothers! In fact, none of these characters are drawn any larger than reality in \\"da quahtahs\\" and \\"da nint wahd.\\"     Ya gotta live there a while to understand but this novel was a snapshot of the kind of misfit that New Orleans specializes in. For the most part, these kind of people find their niches in New Orleans' most arcane troposphere and somehow cobble together a rich and interesting life. Every once in a while someone comes along who is so outre that even New Orleans doesn't know what to do with 'em. John Kennedy Toole was one of those lost souls. Fortunately, the world received a fantastic gift in the master piece \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\". You've got to read it to understand.    Whatever you do, do NOT get excited and rush out to buy Toole's only other published work, The Neon Bible. It was a travesty, fought tooth and nail by executor Dr. Kenneth Holditch, forced by the courts in order to provide revenue for greedy cousins. The Neon Bible was a piece of half-baked juvenalia that Toole himself never tried to publish (it wasn't even finished). It, as opposed to Confederacy, is practically unreadable.    All told, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" should be required reading material before landing at Moissant Airport. Read and laugh. Then, read and use it as your streetmap of the Quarter. Either way, enjoy this flash of brilliance from a slender taper that blazed for a moment in time . . . before giving way to the darkness . . . but, in that moment, how he blazed!    10/13/05 Let me add that I have now listened to C of D on audiobook and re-loved it all over again! The narrator is clearly not from New Orleans---mangles an accent or two, mispronounces street names,keeps saying \\"Sahnta\\"---but generally he does it justice and does a great job with the pomposity of Ignatious. Having read many of these reviews now, I would say that either you get it or you don't. Love it or hate it, read(or listen to it) and you WILL learn something real about New Orleans. I also think that post-Katrina, we can know some things from this book about why things turned out the way they did.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|Considering I had a field-day ripping her first album, I feel obligated to point out the improvment Avril's made in her second effort. <br /> <br />Clearly she's placing the right people around her and it's starting to show.  She's still got a long way to go before she gains any TRUE credibility, but she's quickly making up a lot of ground.
B0002WZTOI|2.0|Wow. <br />How can so many people really think this is a good movie? <br />The majority of the film consists of Cruise and Val just flexing whenever they move. Cruise even flexes, shamelessly, when he checks his watch! <br />The rest of the movie is homoerotica gone beserk.  <br />People, don't be ashmed of what you are. There is nothing wrong with being homosexual. Stand up and say it: you're gay and proud! Now go buy some real gay porn and leave this fluff behind. <br />Cause that's all this is, deep down. Come on: Val and Cruise snapping gum at each other in the shower room? The constant rivalry and the sweaty volleyball game?  <br />Why can't Cruise and \\"The Ice Man\\" Val just kiss already? Why do they keep trying to one-up each other? If anything this movie is about two men who cannot face their homosexuality head-on so they flirt in the poorly masked guise of testing one another. <br />The female lead is good looking, but Cruise is more interested in his male buddies, including \\"The Goose\\", whatever that's supposed to mean. Wink Wink. <br />The movie is also a disgrace for being little more than a montage of music videos, much like ROCKY IV. One video montage after another makes up the bulk of the movie. In the 80's, music videos were fresh and hot so movies somehow got away with this format. <br />The air force is pimped left and right in this as being a frat house for boys who just wanna have fun, when in reality it's just a place where young men go to learn to drop bombs on people. <br />The jets fly about to the Mr. Big and Scorpions type music, creating more inane montages for the mindless masses to drool to. <br />Overall, this movie is drivel.  <br />Two stars because you can laugh at it, ... for a while. <br />The Nintendo video game was much better. All shooting down jets, no man-on-man oil wrestling, no \\"Take My Breath Away\\", no Val gnashing his jaws at me for no reason. Seriously, what was he doing? What the heck is that? It's ridiculous!
0380713802|4.0|I love travelogues, but I've never read any of Bryson's books, so I can't say whether it's one of his best or not. But on its own merits, I enjoyed the writing and his views of the different parts of Europe. He comes up with some wonderful metaphors, and the book held my interest throughout. At age 42, I no longer feel I have to read every word of a book--life's too short, so skip the parts you don't care about--but I did read every word of this one.  BUT--on the last page, when he decides to go home, he reveals that his wife is pregnant again and he really thinks maybe he ought to get back. WHAT??!! What kind of lowdown leaves his pregnant wife and kids fending for themselves while he gallivants around Europe for a couple months? What kind of idiot woman stays married to such a schmuck? I lost all respect for Bryson then and there.  But still, you can't deny the writing is good and enjoyable. So read it, just skip the last page. :)

B0007DAZW8|1.0|This is in response to the review by the gentleman who uses the phrase \\"slamming\\" to sum up the album.  Yes they do play repetitive loops but i think they must be going through a creative block as this album is not worthy to be mentioned along side homework.
B00005JNQ8|5.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" is a riveting suspense thriller! Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are excellent! Sydney Pollock's directing is excellent! This is an engrossing and riveting suspense thriller that will keep your mind and your heart racing at the same time.
B000063DFS|5.0|Just for the record: Zakk Wylde is Ozzy's fourth guitarist. 1) Randy Rhoads, 2) Brad Gillis of Night Ranger (Speak Of The Devil) and 3) Jake E. Lee.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Ozzy since Blizzard, but NMT is truly his finest effort. The over-the-top goofy showmanship is blissfully absent on this one, and we get a look into the soul of an icon of our age. I can't watch his silly TV show, being that his money-and-fame-obsessed family have turned him into a marketing product, and parody of himself. However NMTs will always be a testament to his art.
B000093BDX|5.0|This release features seemingly 30 of The Beach Boys best hits, all on one disc featuring some of the best pop/rock music of all-time. They space out the collection nicely and also found in this compilation are some of the original Mono versions of songs which is a great thrill to hear, and for some of us older fans, brings back very fond memories.<br /><br />It begins with the insatiable California Girls, a song which will always hold a spot on my list of song favourites. Moving along, we get some fantastic choices placed well, including the biggest hits and ones that were minor hits such as Surfin' Safari. The music is in top form sounding as clear and vibrant as ever. The first half of the Disc very much so concentrates on the biggest hits from The Beach Boys while the latter half find us hearing more of the minor, yet nearly equally impressive tracks. This is a wonderful buy for those of us who are casual Beach Boys fans, and is also essential for fans who maybe only own one album of theirs and are looking for some great hits on this \\"Best Of\\" compilation. I have only one minor complaint. They left out a favourite of mine. Where is the song \\"409\\"? I love that song and was hoping it also lied amongst these classics. However, it wasn't easy selecting 30 perfect songs and I'm sure others are still not quite satisfied with the song listing. Surprisingly, and effectively, the compilation closes out with Good Vibrations. This surprised me a little, because at first it the collection seems almost partially in order of how big a hit one particular song was. The essentials are all here: I Get Around, Wouldn't it be nice, God Only Knows, and Surfin' USA and they're still as fresh as ever. There should be no serious complaints about this collection, but as always, there's bound to be someone who'll lash out at this collection which is totally ridiculous.<br /><br />So, If you're a casual fan of The Beach Boys, looking for the best hits, or just wanting all the hits on one disc, this is the perfect buy for you.Despite 409 missing, it's great music which  all rock n' roll lovers should appreciate. Buy it without hesitation if you don't own a Disc by The Beach Boys.on one disc, this is the perfect buy for you.Despite 409 missing, it's great music which   all rock n' roll lovers should appreciate.

B00004XONN|5.0|Wasn't supposed to be a good album they say. Heh! WRONG, this album was awesome! It really has an emotional feel to it. I remember when I first got it and was trying to figure out just what was \\"Kid A\\". From what I gathered in reading some of their interviews, \\"Kid A\\" is the first human clone which they believe to already exist. If you take the approach of \\"Kid A\\" being a human clone living in our world... you get exactly what this album is about. Ok, so maybe I'm wrong... but think about it... from the very first song where \\"everything in its right place\\"... is clearly not in its right place, as the song is all over the board (in a good way!) and just keep moving along the entire album, it is almost like we are listening to a concept album about the first human clone. Now then... my favorite song on this is Idioteque. I love it, love it, love it. I believe this is my favorite song of all time, even more so than Fake Plastic Trees. Thom's volcals in this song are at his best and are so hauntingly amazing and beaufitul I can barely describe how awesome it is. Bottom line, get this album!!
B000031EGV|5.0|Wow, can you imagine waking up on Christmas morning and finding JUMANJI under your tree?  Talk about a game that would literally bring down the house!  JUMANJI was critically bashed upon its release, but viewing it now, one has to wonder why.  It has some pretty inventive special effects, and its premise is neat in that you never know what you get with the roll of the dice.  Giant mosquitos?  Spiders?  Mad monkeys?  A stampede of African animals?  A crazed hunter?  Floods, etc., etc.  While the movie sometimes drifts off on unnecessary tangents, it's still a whirlwind of fantastical adventures.  Robin Williams, the king of playing grown men who act like children, is remarkably restrained as Alan Parrish, a young boy who was sucked into the game back in 1969 and is released in 1995 by a young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce.  In order to stop all the horrendous things happening, they must finish the game Alan started in 1969, which includes his now adult girlfriend, lovingly played by Bonnie Hunt.  Of course, the demented hunter (Jonathan Hyde in a dual role as the hunter and Alan's rather loutish father) doesn't want the game finished.  Smaller children may find themselves frightened by some of the catastrophies that plague our heroes, but for older children and even us adult children, JUMANJI delivers.
B000002TQV|5.0|I once listened to this CD non-stop on a 14 hour driving trip. This album is amazing in every way possible. Radiohead is my favorite band of all time. Get this CD, you will _NOT_ regret it. Even in 2005 this album still withstands the test of time. Every song is great, unlike today's albums that have so many 'filler' crappy songs. I think they said it best in an interview when asked about how the record industry was blaming music piracy causing low sales, \\"I think they should maybe concentrate on releasing better records\\" (not an exact quote, but close). Amen... and Radiohead is the answer!!
0780624890|5.0|BLADE is one rollercoaster ride of a movie.  Fueled by an intense performance from Wesley Snipes (easily his best action role), the comic book movie is one heck of a ride.  Snipes plays a half-man/half-vampire who has taken it on his own to ride the world of vampires, who \\"are everywhere.\\"  His mentor, Kris Kristofferson in one of his better roles too, has trained him well and provided him with all kinds of nasty weapons.  The action scenes are awesome in their frenetic scope, and they never stop coming.  Stephen Dorff as the vampire Deacon Frost is the epitome of vampiric evil, and Dorff's performance is underrated and he matches Snipes in all their scenes.  Donal Logue (Comic Book Villains) is appropriately nasty as the henchman who keeps losing his limbs; N'Bushe Wright is very good as the hematologist who finds herself victimized by vampires and ends up joining Snipes' crusade; Sanaa Latham (Man on Fire, AVP) is seductively sinister as Blade's vampire mother.  Director Stephen Norrington (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) knows what the audience wants and he delivers.  Udo Kier (Andy Warhols  Dracula) has a supporting role as well.<br /><br />BLADE inspired two sequels, which I haven't seen yet, but if there as intense and imaginative as this one, I'll be happy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is one of, if not, the greatest band of all time and this album stands as a tribute to just how great they are. Every song on this album is amazing. Thom's vocals are unbelievable. I know it is hard for some people to grasp the concept that someone can use their voice as an instrument rather than just \\"saying\\" the words. I love everything about this ablum... and well, I love everything about Radiohead. Every album they have released is 5 star quality. My only hope is that they give us at least one more album.
B00005R24K|5.0|When you closely examine THE EVIL DEAD, you may ask yourself, why is this movie considered a horror classic?  The acting is pretty bad, even Bruce Campbell is ineffectual in the early scenes of the movie, but once the demons kick in, Campbell turns on the talent and assuages a classic hero in Ash.  The gore is plenty, but the special effects are rather cheesy, down to the oatmeal that comes out of one of the demons near the end.  But one can't deny director Sam Raimi's incomparable style and energy.  There is suspense in every scene in the cabin; the incessant barrage of blood and violence in the final scenes is both repulsive and mesmerizing.  Notice how Raimi uses Campbell's and his girlfriend's eyes in two very different ways.  Initially, it's a lover's game over whether or not she's going to open a surprise gift; later, it's a demonic game when he's preparing to bury his former lover's demonic body.  I guess the reason THE EVIL DEAD stands at the head of its class is its bold desire to be as frighteningly horrific and sardonically humorous at the same time, with no respite for the weary.  It's claustrophobic intensity and its over the top action makes THE EVIL DEAD one of our most unique and thrilling horror films, spawning two commendable sequels as well and making both Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi very successful young men.
1558908323|5.0|That quote from JURASSIC PARK always comes to mind in films like MIMIC. <br />A scientist finds a way to beat a horrible disease crippling and killing children, but the method used is not fully thought through. One senior geneticist is ignored, and the JUDAS  bug is implemented. And what they have done is accelerate the genetic process by many thousands of generations in a short space of time ... in a species that was engineered to \\"die out\\". <br />The acting is top notch, casting has people perfect for the role, and this stellar cast delivers in spades. <br /> <br />ENJOY.
B000000WA4|4.0|<br />A decade ago, I was in Sam Goody's looking for ANY Alternative album to quell my disappointment over the Nevermind tape I'd bought the year previous. I hated it. It did nothing for me. It was mediocrity glossed up and marketed as Alternative when it was the most mainstream album ever. It didn't express what I felt. I wasn't an apathetic stoner. I was an awkward-yet-intelligent teen who didn't fit in. I came across the double tape set of Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness in the store, bought it, took it home, and loved it to pieces. All the radio songs PLUS others just as good. Further proof that Alternative doesn't need to be a tuneless, glossy-over mess from Seattle to be good. Thank God The Pumpkins came along and re-invented the traditional schematics of 90's Rock. What other Alternative band would have the guts to combine distortion, a string section, synths, and guitar Rock on the same album (besides the fantastic Depeche Mode)? \\"BW/BW\\" \\"1979\\" \\"Love\\" and \\"Bodies\\" are all songs I couldn't live without.  <br /> <br />I also recommend DM to any Pumpkins fan. The Pumpkins went on tour with them and recorded a great rendition of \\"Never Let Me Down\\".  <br />
B00003CX8V|5.0|Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, who is strongarmed by his executive bosses into letting them use his apartment for after-hours rendezvous with woman. Things get complicated when the big boss, played wonderfully by Fred MacMurray, wants to use it, too, only it's to use it with a girl that Lemmon likes also. Shirley Maclaine plays the girl, and she's never been better. The movie goes on too long, especially in the middle part when Maclaine is forced to stay with Lemmon after a suicide attempt after she learns that MacMurray is only stringing her along. But the movie has a great sophisticated feel about it, thanks to Billy Wilder's script and direction, and the great theme music. Quite a bit of the movie remains memorable long after viewing it. It won a bunch of Oscars and deservedly so. Definitely worth a watch.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|Here Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman show why they are superstars and why they are where they are.  Both give excellent performances in what is an interesting if sometimes not very thrilling political thriller.   <br /> <br />Sydney Pollack directs an interesting movie where we never really know the motives of everyone involved until the end.  He and the screenwriters do a grand job of giving us little pieces of information throughout the movie where we can, along with Silvia and Tobin, find out exactly what is going on, why it's happening, and who is doing it.  While there are moments of genuine suspense, anticipation and fear, overall the movie is more talking than action.  People who don't like talking movies may want to think twice about going because at 2 hours 20 minutes, it could be a potentially long time.  I happened to enjoy it, but I also enjoyed the interplay between Silvia and Tobin because you never really know what the cards will deal.   <br /> <br />Fans of political thrillers will enjoy it, and it was interesting to see a little behind the U.N. doors.  This is the first movie that has allowed Hollywood to film behind the U.N. doors in the unclassified areas and it was kind of cool.  I'm at a loss of what exactly to say.  It isn't the greatest movie I've seen but it is probably one of the best released this year so far.  The acting in it is incredible (as always when concerned with these two actors) and there are enough little surprises about how the plot comes together to create enough intrigue to last for the length of the movies.  Those who don't like a lot of talking in movies may be turned off though.  Overall, I'd recommend it.  It's actually intelligent and sometimes genuinely thrilling.
B000059TEP|4.0|I give it 4 1/2 stars. Another sappy tear-jerker of a flick, but this movie is actually pretty damn good. Things start happening when a boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) are approached by an armed mugger. Sam Wheat ends up getting killed after the thug shoots him in the chest and doesn't even realize it UNTIL his ghost sees Molly sobbing while holding his lifeless body in her arms. Wheat later has an entertaining and interesting encounter with a spiritual reader Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). Both end up helping one another out. This movie hardly has a boring moment. Slow, maybe but never boring. Many twists and surprises included. For example, when several times during the two plus hours, we see what happens to a person's soul the VERY MOMENT they die or when Wheat uses Brown's body to make 'one last physical' contact with Molly before Heaven whisks him away. Good acting, directing and script. Indeed, an in-depth drama. See it with someone you love.
B00005JLU1|4.0|To enjoy and love \\"Crybaby\\" as much as I do, you need to have an appreciation of John Waters' strange, tacky, and very tongue-and-cheek approach to film making. Anyone who sits down to a Waters' film and takes it seriously is missing the point.  His films are meant to be cheesy and ridiculous because they are, in his own way, attempts at social and cinematic commentary.  \\"Crybaby's\\" silly songs, groanable dialogue, and off-the-wall characters are intential - they are both mocking and emmulating a world that Waters wishes he could have been a part of.   <br /> <br />Of course, you don't have to worry about looking for the deeper meanings in a John Waters film - another reason they're so much fun to watch. You can just sit back and laugh.
B00005JNQ8|5.0|Sometimes movies can be parceled into good points and bad points: the story may be weak, the acting may be pedestrian, the camera work may be so over the top that the film is lost, the editing may cry for clarity - or the opposites can occur in one or two of these categories for critique.  Not so in the case if THE INTERPRETER.  This film is a model of integrity and incisive execution of a fine script into an intelligent, highly suspenseful foray into the world of international politics as 'overseen' by the United Nations.<br /><br />In the pre-title opening scenes we are plunged into the imaginary African country of Motobo and witness a tense and grisly episode that for once serves as the appetizer for the story that is to follow. Watch is very carefully and you may be able to get close to the spark that motivates the action and message of the film.<br /><br />Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is a governmental agent in charge of protecting visiting dignitaries, but as he enters the story he is an emotionally broken man, drinking heavily, an in mourning for a wife that has once again left him for another only to end up dead in a car accident: his outlook on life is bleak but he is able to maintain his brilliance in his job. His job partner Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) is able to keep him together and lighten the atmosphere with some very funny if unintentionally comic asides.  The two are assigned to the upcoming UN visit by Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), the president of Motobo, who plans to address the United Nations Assembly in defense of his controversial position.<br /><br />Incidentally observed high above the delegates during a UN session is Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter for the UN who is one of the few who speaks Ku, the language of Motobo (she is from that small country riddled with political intrigue and strife, having been involved in the peoples' struggle for fair government until an incident altered her perception and encouraged her to leave her country and seek the higher moral issues of the UN as a voice).  After an evacuation of the UN building on a routine day, she returns to her soundproof interpreters' booth to retrieve her bag and while there she overhears a whispered statement in Ku that sets the suspenseful story into play.  Frightened she has been observed in the dark of after-hours at the UN, she eventually  tells the authorities about the whispered message that likely indicates an assasination threat to Zuwanie.<br /><br />Keller and Woods question her, doubt her story as a hoax, begin to suspect her as a perpetrator and eventually believe her and are assigned to protect her.  Posted in the apartment across the street from Silvia's apartment, Keller is slowly drawn into the credibility of the intrigue and spends every moment of his broken life guarding Silvia.<br /><br />Tension mounts as Zuwanie's arrival approaches and amidst all of the preparation, clues are dropped, plots and manhunts abound, and eventually played out against this background of terror Sylvia and Keller mutually reveal their inner demons and bond.  The story seers to a breathtaking conclusion that ties the ending to the beginning in a climatic scene.  The ending for once addresses not only this story but makes a powerful statement about the multiple countries around the globe that are involved in heinous genocide.<br /><br />And on top of this fine story is the crowning achievement of the extraordinary acting skills of Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn.  Their spectrums of finessed qualities of character creation are as fine as any actor on film today.  Whether in individual scenes or in the electrifying interchanges together, these two consummate actors redefine the gold standard of acting. They are amazingly fine.  Catherine Keener as the sole comic relief in this tense story is the pinnacle of understatement. The entire supporting cast from bit part to major/minor role is superb. Sidney Pollack's direction keeps the story focused andpropelled in the way of the masters of the genre (one aside: why must he always write himself into the screen action of his films? Megalomania?).<br /><br />The musical score by James Newton Howard is riveting as are the cinematography of Darius Khondji and the precise and story-driven editing of William Steinkamp. In all this is a successful film from every vantage and will doubtless go down as one of the finest films of the year and of the genre.  Highly recommended.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|The extraordinary music of Fiona Apple is almost now-legendary in the world of alternative rock. Her 1996 debut \\"Tidal\\" was definitely a stunning collection of rock-pop-jazz influenced songs that blew critics away. Her fanbase was moulded from this album alone, and it sure was one hell of a strong fanbase. Her refusal to conform to the illusion of celebrity and the fakeness of the music industry earned her respect and devotion from fans but mocking and ridicule from her fellow peers.<br /><br />Fiona returned three and a half years later in late 1999 with her second album \\"When The Pawn...\\" This 90-word long album title is more remembered for that aforementioned poetic statement, but musically it is a total masterpiece. Not many artists can top their incredible debut album with the sophomore release, but Fiona is definitely an objection to the rule. This album is, in my opinion, slightly better than her debut, but my opinions change like my underwear (which is often) so tomorrow I could be saying that I prefer the debut. On this album Fiona explored her love for bluesy-jazz type music even further, and the result is more amazing lyrics, stunning music and incredible arrangements. The woman bares her soul like no other female artist; the female Kurt Cobain in my opinion.<br /><br />The album opens with the brilliant \\"On The Bound.\\" This song has a very plodding, mid-tempo beat with the piano being played hard and strongly. Fiona's vocals are very powerful in the verses, and even more so in the choruses where she bellows \\"You're all I need!\\" This is such a great song, than once it finishes you're disappointed, but then pleased when you hear the intro of the next song. The song in question is \\"To Your Love,\\" which is a very fast and rocking song that is even better than its predecessor in my opinion. The verses are great, almost spoken, and the chorus is very anthemic. The best part of the song comes when Fiona vents her anger into the words, \\"My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you! But by the time I'm close to you, I lose my desideratum and now you...\\" This part is incredible, it has to be heard to be believed. \\"Limp\\" is an amazing song in which Fiona vents her anger so much that it has been said to make Alanis' \\"You Oughta Know\\" quiver! This is definitely Fiona's angriest song ever. The verses creep in slowly with a sense of anticipation, before breaking out into venomous choruses. The drum beats build in the verses to let you know what's bubbling away underneath the surface, waiting to be released...<br /><br />\\"Love Ridden\\" is an absolutely gorgeous ballad about a relationship that has been destroyed, with sad lyrics such as \\"Only kisses on the cheek from now on.\\" Fiona's vocals on this song are so emotional and intense, and they work in total harmony with the sole piano. \\"Paper Bag\\" is seen by many as the best song on the album, but this is not the case for me. I love the song, though, it's incredible; the paper bag analogy at the beginning of the song in the first verse is amazing, and really gets you thinking about what Fiona is trying to communicate. Reading the lyrics, one will feel depressed by the tone of the song, but Fiona sings with a light-hearted joy. Rather unusual but effective. \\"A Mistake\\" is one of my favourites on the album, because it's different to anything she's ever done. The lyrics are great, and the focal point of the song is where Fiona's vocals are drawn out as they rise and fall, before the start of the second verse. \\"Fast As You Can\\" is the album's most popular song as it was the biggest hit to be released as a single. The song is a fast-paced, almost schizophrenic/psychedelic observation of Fiona's interest in a man. The choruses scuttle along until the song finishes, shifting shape and speed all the time.<br /><br />\\"The Way Things Are\\" is a real grower that I wasn't too keen on to begin with. However, I really do love it now. There's something about this song that just takes youaway - I think it's the guitar in the background as the song plays out, it's so vivid. I love it when Fiona sings \\"How can I fight, when we're on the same side. How can I fight beside you.\\" The next song is the amazing \\"Get Gone.\\" This is definitely an album highlight, because the piano is so unusual. The riff that Fiona adopts here is absolutely unforgettable and it will burn its way into your mind forever. The verses are amazing as Fiona sings about a man she wishes would just leave her alone. Lyrics such as \\"I'll idealize, then realise that it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid, and there's nothing left to grieve,\\" are so intelligent and thought-provoking. Every word just fits perfectly and the way they are arranged is beautiful. The album closes with the amazing \\"I Know.\\" In this song there is almost light at the end of the very dark tunnel that has been the past nine songs. The blues-style comes out most in this slow, moving song. It's very beautiful and powerful, especially Fiona's vocals twisting themselves around the violins.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />I bought this album about three weeks ago, and was completely blown away. It's the kind of album that requires repeated listens for you to really benefit from all the little things that form this amazing record. It's been almost six years since this album was released, and I'm only sad that I didn't buy it sooner. After my recent love of artists such as Tori Amos and Bjork, it seems only fitting to expand this interest and explore more alternative female artists. This album will stand out for much more than it's long title in the long run.

B000001GK9|3.0|it's difficult to argue with Mahler,interpretations and who conducts it, who brings the real true Mahler to light who understood his soul unpretenciously, well that's difficult to comprehend for someone like Bernstein I think you really get more Lenny than Mahler, but the two \\"souls\\" meet someplace and that is exciting,the music's content is never sacrificed,mayber there are wrong notes plyed more of them. I think Mahler has ended if we say his music should be like this and no other way.<br /><br />Abbado's Ninth was a new experience,taking over the helmsman wheel from Karajan,it is truly balanced in every respect,emotive, sonically, aesthetically without sacrificing the dramatic and Abbado and Boulez have indeed more sensitivity for the timbre produced,isn;t music about hearing and listening, on the clarity of what you are hearing. Karajan was not one to practice such sensitivity, I think he usually had a strong vision on what the piece should be to make the most memorable experience,usually the obvious predictable features of the work were what had guided his conducting, Solti has a similar demeanor.This philosophy I think works best with music that has a vacuous strength in and of itself as Richard Strauss.Karajan's skill were elsewhere no timbral sensitivity,he rarely conducted modern repertoire,mostly a corporate planner for the Berlin music establishment, he had his sights set on the Almighty Buck let's be clear about this,so his Berlin Sound was that \\"cathedral\\" sound, rounded full bodied, excellent for Bruckner, and indeed his Brahms is a vacuous overblown affair, Brahms was a man ofdiscreet private timbre,not giant cathedrals, and for what Karajan actually understood of Mahler is open to question at least from this recording.Certainly it is easy to judge all this in retrospect for music grows and develops, we never stop thinking about it, and conductors as well think about what can be done further, I'm sure Boulez began thinking about Mahler when he attended Klemperer's rehearsals in the Sixties in London, the last years for Klemperer.A useful conception of Mahler I think comes from Theodor Adorno who always drew attention to Mahler's interest in timbre,in the strings in uncomfortable strident positions,that he was no great innovator,and how the orchestral timbre can be changed,and searches for a \\"tone\\" a balance of colours as his haunting \\"Seventh Symphony\\" and he always revised the parts after he had heard the morning rehearsal, He sent poor Alma back to the hotel room to correct parts. The Ninth of Mahler was his final testament to art,it was about the transgression of beauty, of the human spirit,little did Gustav know that the darkest pages of Europa were coming. But here he enjoyed the Landler, the thrill of childhood, of unadulterated thoughts,of physical labour, the peasant life filled with the rush of blood(as D.H.Lawrence said of the German peasantry) or the Rondo Burleske the complexity of the metropolis, Vienna a city obsessed with itself, with the science of the mind,games and sexual play, the psychology of the penumbral, and the final Adagio, nothing triumphant here, a Symphonie that ends slowly,an ongoing endless melos.The first movement was like Mahler's diseased heart that didn;t beat a regular pulse.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|I am not a huge fan of of any of the four actors.  I like them, but they wouldn't be a reason I would watch a movie.  I popped Closer in because the previews were so sparse that I figured I would watch it and actually see what it was about.  The movie itself isn't half-bad; it's obviously not a rosy, Brady Bunch kind of film, but I guess it's realistic in the sense that (some) people swear, have sex, look at porno sites, strip, etc.  There were parts of this film I thought were funny...mostly Clive Owen's character because he seems to be a strong up-and-coming actor.  (I did really like King Arthur and he was pretty hot in it) <br />    My biggest surpise was Natalie Portman.  I thought she brought a lot of truth and vision to the film, especially since it's an extremely dilalogue-driven piece, and she shined.  She showed range, and I honestly found myself saying, \\"Natalie Portman was a much more likely Oscar contender than Virginia Madsen (Sideways) was.\\"  Virginia, I love her, had zero range in her fifteen minutes performance, but that's another review.  I just really couldn't believe what an excellent job Portman did...and Clive Owen is certainly upping the scale in the looks department.  Julia?  Eh. she should stick to bland roles like My Best Friend's Wedding...when she gets serious, her career suffers.  Go Natalie!
B000002J1O|5.0|I listened to Genesis obsessively while in graduate school and this 1973 recording was always a favorite.  For me, Selling England by the Pound represents everything about progressive rock that I hold near and dear: intricate ensemble work, virtuosic musicianship, cool synthesizer sounds (ARP Pro Soloist!), and \\"hummable\\" melodies.  I know the \\"hummable\\" melodies thing will raise a few eyebrows, but they are nice to have around and there is no shortage of them on this recording.<br /><br />There is a mixture of long and short pieces on Selling England by the Pound, which range from quiet acoustic pieces to full-blown, over the top, prog extravaganzas.  The longer pieces include Dancing with the Moonlit Knight (8'03\\"), Firth of Fifth (9'37\\"), The Battle of Epping Forest (11'44\\"), and The Cinema Show/Aisle of Plenty (12'41\\").  Sandwiched in-between the longer pieces is the poppy I Know What I Like (in 1974, it reached #21 in England), More Fool Me, which is an acoustic piece with Phil Collins on vocals, and After the Ordeal, which is a short instrumental written by guitarist Steve Hackett.  Each of the longer pieces are excellent examples of their highly disciplined ensemble approach to arrangements, which include pre-composed solos and display the use of a few carefully placed chords that make the transition between sections in different keys seamless.  The transitional chords and mellow 12-string acoustic guitar parts, along with smooth synthesizer and guitar tones, a full Rickenbacker bass sound from Mike Rutherford, and the ability of excellent drummer Phil Collins to make even a 5/4 seem natural impart an unhurried, warm, and intimate feel to the whole recording.<br /><br />Based on what I have read, writers block plagued Genesis during the recording period even though Selling England by the Pound is conceptually sound (it comments on English class structure) and it is only Firth of Fifth that suffers from a dodgy lyric.  Furthermore, keyboardist Tony Banks expressed irritation with vocalist Peter Gabriel's decision to plaster lyrics over the entirety of the already busy The Battle of Epping Forest.  So many lyrics in fact, that Peter reportedly ran out of breath during live performances of the song.<br /><br />Although the sound quality of this 1994 remaster is not nearly as good as my old LP, it is still pretty good.<br /><br />In spite of it all, the guys in Genesis came through with a remarkable recording of progressive rock - one that I return to again and again.

0385513755|2.0|I had to read several of this author's books after losing a bet to one of the smaller ladies in my doltish wife's Big Readers Book Club.  They (\\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\") were fast paced, easy to read, and contained some interesting (and perhaps bogus) information about science and theology.  This book is similar in the last regard, but a little sluggish in terms of pace.  The writing is unpoetic (there is no other word for it) and the plot is silly.  Bessie loved all the gibberish about the sacred femini and even insisted I refer to her as The Grail after she caught me sneaking a beer at little Chad's school play.  Well, I found it pretty ridiculous (the book, not the beer).  Almost as ridiculous as the casting in that \\"film\\" 'The Return of Martin Short'.  But my real complaint isn't about the content--which is poor at best--but about the item itself:<br /><br />The pictures are nice, appropriate, and a-plenty. However, the book itself is bulky, heavy, hard to read in unnatural light (the pages are too shimmery), and just plain annoying to lug around.  Worst of all, I hurt my excellent throwing arm tossing it across the room after Bessie shouted \\"I am the sacred femini, worship me\\" after I asked her to refill my beer mug.  A losing situation in every regard.  And not recommend to anyone.

B000002AHC|5.0|Recorded while the original line up of The Byrds were in the midst of breaking up, \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" has a number of rich, powerful songs. During the recording of the album David Crosby left the band as did drummer Michael Clarke. Original member (and the band's best songwriter) Gene Clark returned briefly appearing as a backing vocalist on the finished version of \\"Goin' Back\\" and co-writing and appearing on \\"Get To You\\" (although it's credited to McGuinn-Hillman, Chris Hillman had nothing to do with the song. McGuinn isn't quite sure how the credits were messed up as he himself has admitted that Clark co-wrote the song with him). In the middle of chaos McGuinn and Hillman pressed on. With the exception of the disasterous reunion album \\"The Byrds\\" in 1974, this was truly the last gasp from a quartet that introduced Dylan to a larger world and produced a quartet of the best folk-rock records ever during the 60's.<br /><br />Crosby's \\"Dolphin Smile\\" and the McGuinn-Hillman song \\"Change is Now\\" are among the other highlights on a stunning finale to the original band's career. Augmented by 6 bonus tracks, we get to hear McGuinn's odd \\"Moog Raga\\" instrumental, a version of \\"Bound to Fall\\" (which Hillman later convinced Stephen Stills to cover for his Manassass release in 1972) and Crosby's \\"Triad\\" which probably should have been included on the original release (and was the final straw that pushed him to exit the band). There's also \\"Universal Mind Decoder\\" an early version of \\"Change is Now\\" as well as a slower less interesting version of the Goffin-King song \\"Goin' Back\\".<br /><br />Featuring great liner notes by David Fricke and Johnny Rogan's track by track analysis of the album (Rogan wrote a biography of the band), \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" marked the end of an era for this great American band. McGuinn and Hillman would recruit Gram Parsons for the classic country-rock album \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" and then Hillman would finally depart to join Parsons' in The Flying Burrito Brothers. McGuinn would be the last man standing recruiting the brilliant guitarist Clarence White (who appears as a session musician on the album)and Gene Parsons to fill out the band. McGuinn would produce one more worthwhile album \\"Untitled\\" featuring White. The rest of the albums he recorded under The Byrds moniker would slow a sharp decline in the quality of the music and the band's fortunes.n Parsons' in The Flying Burrito Brothers.

There are more things to say about Meteora. But I'll be short as usual. The release of this album consolidated Linkin Park's position as one of the biggest bands on the planet. This album rocks!
0755111974|5.0|Gerald Durrell was not only a naturalist and a gifted writer about his beloved animals, but a loving brother and son whose descriptions of his family and their foibles will keep you laughing all the way through.

B000002AGE|5.0|This excellent 1977 release opens with the highly popular Birdland, a synthesizer-heavy piece that introduces the awesome talents of the greatest bassist in the world, Jaco Pastorius.  As a bass player myself that was heavily influenced by Jaco, I was floored by his incredible technique on this recording, which includes a heady brew of harmonics, false harmonics, chords, and occasional bursts of lightning fast 64th note triplets.  This is not to say that Jaco could not lay back - the moody and haunting Zawinul composition A Remark You Made features some very tasteful and restrained playing.  The Wayne Shorter tune Harlequin and Zawinul's The Juggler are also very nice and similar in texture to A Remark You Made.  The truly odd track is the the percussion driven piece Rumba Mama, which features a live performance by a duo comprised of excellent drummer Alex Acuna and percussionist Manola Badrena, who also \\"sing-shouts\\" in Spanish at the beginning of the piece.  Although I really enjoy the entire disc, for me the highlights of Heavy Weather include Birdland, A Remark You Made, the Jaco tunes Teen Town and Havona, along with Wayne Shorter's superb Palladium.  Although Joe Zawinul's use of synthesizers is heavy (a lot of Oberheim Polyphonic and ARP 2600) the sounds are natural and blend well with the jazzier and \\"straighter\\" aspects of the music.  Then again, I am a huge prog rock fan so the synthesizers probably would not bother me much.  If you like this recording, Black Market (1976) is also superb and in addition to Zawinul and Shorter, features a large and revolving rhythm section including: Narada Michael Walden (drums), Chester Thompson (drums), Jaco (bass), and Alphonse Mouzon (bass).
B0001CCXY8|4.0|One of the marks of a good band is songwriting. If you look at Cannibal Corpse's song writing from Eaten Back to Life to the present day, you notice significant advancement in musical composition. When Cannibal Corpse started with Eaten Back To Life, they sounded more like heavy death thrash...but this is a jaw dropping promotion to hellish, brutal, and technical death metal compared to the primitive and gruesome debut album. Instead of setting themselves into a comfort zone, they push harder and harder with each album, which shows in The Wretched Spawn when compared to their previous release - Gore Obsessed. Not only does this package come with the feral and fierce Wretched Spawn album, it also comes with a bonus DVD which contains footage of the making of the album. <br /> <br />I'll say right now that the drumming doesn't really compliment the acrimonious guitars and bass on the equal level. Paul is a great drummer for being self taught, but let's face it; the guy has been doing practically the same thing for the last ten years. Mid-paced blast beats and other medial drumming techniques are all he really seems to go for in a world of hasty music. I don't mind a drummer taking an intermediate stance in speed, but when it becomes the only style the drummer uses, it's pretty much an unspoken connotation that maybe they need to try something new. This isn't bad drumming by any standards; it's just very parallel to previous albums. <br /> <br />Gathering from previous performances, this is George Fisher's best vocal delivery since he's been with the band. Instead of trailing off in mid song and going in seemingly random directions, Fisher's singing goes more with the flow of the music and keeps that tight formation all the way through. This is why Barnes can't hold a torch to Fisher. Other than the fact that Barnes' bloated ego helped him gain momentum to being ejected from the band, he had no vocal rhythm in comparison to Corpsegrinder. Barnes, more or less, would wait for the band to conjure some devastating tunes, and then just dump his vocals onto them without any precision or planning. <br /> <br />Let's face it - Barnes was sloppy and Fisher is not. Undeniable is Fisher's ability to sing more coherently as well. Take Tomb of the Mutilated for example; that was a great album, but most of the time it was a vein effort to even attempt to understand what Barnes was singing. While vocal comprehension isn't always priority to most people who listen to death metal, I consider it a pleasure to be able to decipher what it is I'm listening to while it remains brutal and heavy. Little has changed in Fisher's voice since Gallery of Suicide; it's still got that mid-tone growl that lies in comparison with death metal singers like Glen Benton and Erik Rutan. <br /> <br />Jack Owen and Pat O'Brien rend flesh into nothing but pulp by creating a razor storm of sharp and succinct structure with their fleet and expeditious playing styles. Jack Owen wrote four songs on this album, some that I enjoy immensely, others that I think are just good. I don't know what it is about Owen's writing style, but his songs don't stick with me the way O'Brien's or Webster's do. Jack Owen tends to overuse fast chug riffs, has seemingly synthetic aggression, as well as lack of memorable tunes. Owen just seems to be short of passion in a lot of the songs he writes, as if he couldn't get into it. <br /> <br />I find Pat O'Brien to be much more of an interesting song writer than Jack Owen on this album, due to the fact that he usually goes for faster and more difficult riffs than Owen. I am not a believer of the whole \\"complexity equates to splendor\\" type of mind set, but Pat writes catchy stuff and manages to keep pushing the boundaries on difficulty. If you watch the DVD that came with this album, you'll be able to see Pat playing guitar for one of his songs, \\"Frantic Disembowelment,\\" which takes away any doubt that Cannibal Corpse go for simplicity as Pat runshis fingers around the fret board with amazing speed. When Pat plays, he goes for unrelenting aggression and brutality; I notice that Pat tends to favor tremolo harmonization as well. This also gives me the idea that he actually loves what he's doing, unlike Jack (it's why he left the band after all). <br /> <br />The entire production is crystal clear, much like Gore Obsessed. This is also the first all digital album that Cannibal Corpse have done. The problem with old Cannibal Corpse albums was that the production usually rendered Alex's bass sounding almost like a joke. Remember the nice little bass solo on Hammer Smashed Face before the singing started? It sounds like a piece of rubber! <br /> <br />Thankfully, the serene production allows you to hear Alex's bass as it pummels in the background like a machine gun. I'd love to hear more standout bass activity from Alex, maybe a bass solo or two, but I digress. Production can't get much better than this. Almost every song on here is built around speed, except for the ever groovy \\"Festering in the Crypt,\\" which speaks in more of a \\"sit down, relax, and enjoy\\" type of manner. Some thrash elements show themselves in songs like \\"Severed Head Stoning,\\" and attack all bones in the listener's neck by forcing them to head bang until paralysis is achieved. <br /> <br />I can't say I was really looking forward to this album. I purchased it the day it came out, but I was expecting it to be somewhat of a Gore Obsessed clone, but no...This is even better! I tip my hat to the death metal veterans for spawning this fine creation.

The music on the cd is amazing, the singer is amazing. The words sound cool, but in english-Rammstein would the wussiest metal band around. Most lyrics are very cheesey, and makes you wonder why does he sound so mad when he is singing about something like that? Rammstein is better off in German, if it was English-the cd would be the funniest non comedy cd ever.

B0002XDODU|3.0|Mutter was an ace album and one that everybody who likes the heavier, more gothic side of rock should own. however this album ditches the electrics that made them the kings of industrial metal in favour for more MTV-friendly metal (Amerika for example). Don't get me wrong this is still a good album from Rammstein and I'm glad i bought it im jus slightly disappointed with the way they have structured their music. Listening to songs such as Keine Lust, Mein Teil and Reise, Reise (the highlights of the album) you can see how this album should have been. But then listening to songs such as Stein Um Stein, Dalai Lama, Moskau and Morgenstern you have a bland mixture of heavy guitars and the lead singer speaking some random gibberish in German. Moskau reminds me of Speiluhr off the Mutter album and that isn't a good thing since Speiluhr is crap as well. This is a good album but i'd stick with Mutter. If you already own Mutter then get this album just so you can have the latest Ramstein album. If you don't own Mutter, why the hell are you sitting at your computer. GET OUT AND BUY IT!!! NOW!  <br />Conclusion: Buy Mutter instead <br />Best Songs: <br />Reise, Reise 10/10 <br />Ohne Dich 9/10 <br />Mein Teil 9/10
0767830555|5.0|There's no point in gushing because as you can see there's more than enough to convince you to buy this classic. It aims at two audiences, crime noir fans and the Travis Bickle-ites, and for a time I felt very much like 'ol Travis myself. Love, acceptance, sanity, these were things that were alien to his mind, and when you live in a world, no, a city, where you're a thread away from becoming another faceless drone in the sea of insanity around you, it is a truly depressing thought because it's not a question of 'if' but rather a question of 'when'. The moment Travis Bickle topples the television set over with his foot, his downward spiral truly begins in horrific fashion.     It holds up to this day as a truly unforgettable film because every single person who had a hand in making it worked in perfect harmony to craft what could have been a simple reel of film into a gem. The creepy, soft jazz-laden music score by Bernard Hermann, the hypnotic cinematography, the top-notch directing by Marty Scorcese, the disturbing yet insightful screenplay by Paul Schrader, and one of the best performances by a young DeNiro, all prove that you're not only watching a movie, you're watching cinema.     Alright. I gushed. How can you not?

038073186X|5.0|It was just by chance I picked up this book in a local bookstore, I'm not overly into thrillers but I thought I'd try this one just to expand my horzions in the literature field. The book is about a cop named Eddie trying to uncover the secrets of a insane asylum, pretty adventurous topic to create and much to my suprise it's done not only perfectly, but with originallity and with extreme cleverness.<br /><br />Lehane mixes thrills and suspense within a bowl, then sets a timer for them to rise and believe me arise they do, by the end of the book you'll be craving for more of Lehane. The story flows without ever floundering once, the pace is contstant from the get go and nothing including the hurricane featured in the book can stop this runaway book from reaching it's climax.<br /><br />Entwined within the book are Eddie's memories and dreams from the sudden loss of his wife, usually I would groan at this part as often in the past I have felt that writers throw these in for character background as an afterthought to try and tie their story together, Lehane on the other hand uses this charater's background in a different way and uniquely, it is very much still part of the plot while at the same time contributing to Eddie's history.<br /><br />Without giving too much of the story away, we watch Eddie as he tries to unscramble the hidden secrets of human experimentation that are occuring on Shutter Island, the story unravels itself quickly, with more than a few twists embedded within and as I reached the end of this book, I realised before my final few pages that I had beome a huge fan of Lehane's writing, his writing prose, his character development and his plots.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the most clever and well written books I've read. Well Done Mr Lehane
B000002UJQ|5.0|1993. When I first hear of Radiohead, I'm 6 or so at the time and my brother is listening to \\"Creep\\" incessantly like every other teenager is at the time. \\"Creep\\" was without a doubt one of the best alternative rock songs of the 90's, but I never really cared for \\"Pablo Honey\\" as a whole. Radiohead is dismissed as a one-hit wonder (and I have a feeling that most alternative rock bands are falling under this bill even now as we speak). 2002. I'm watching a re-run of Saturday Night Live when I see Radiohead perform their jazz-meets-funk-with-a-vengeance number \\"National Anthem\\". The band was really into their music and I mean REALLY into it. Front man Thom York was stomping on the stage, wagging his radio-sized cranium all over the place, and I thought to myself, \\"What the hell is with this nut??\\"    2004. I hear a lot of good rep about \\"OK Computer\\" and am a little dismissive at first, even when it is among MTV2's 25 Greatest CDs, but my curiosity is overwhelming. I buy it for 20 dollars without listening to any song clips like any normal skeptic should, but boy am I glad I didn't, because when I popped that CD in and played \\"Airbag\\", it blew me the hell away. Never before had I heard alternative music sound so fresh and unique, and OK came out around '97, so trust the words of others when they say it has enduring appeal. \\"Pablo Honey\\" this is not.     As for the tracks themselves, almost all of them manage to carry along a disjointed premise that revolves around the future. At its core however is a colorful and sometimes scary exploration of de-humanization. All the songs range from funky to poppy to creepy to rockin'. Whatever you're looking for you will find it in this brilliant little package. I can't praise it more. 5 stars.

0790737345|5.0|Nicolas Cage gives a wonderful performance as Seth, an Angel who falls in love and begins to long for the ability to express that love, in a film that in some respects resembles the 1930's film \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" with Fredric March and Evelyn Veneble. Seth's assignment as an angel is to help the dead cross over in this quasi remake of the Wim Wenders foreign film, \\"Wings of Desire.\\" Few films since the glory days of Hollywood and the old studio system have been given the romantic glow of this film.<br /><br />Meg Ryan is Maggie, the heart surgeon who is the object of Seth's affection. He is stunned when she somehow senses his prescence when trying to save one of her patients, and is touched and bewildered by her. Andre Braugher steals every scene he is in as Seth's fellow Angel and friend. They all hang out at the library and gather every morning at the beach to see the sunrise and hear the singing of heaven.<br /><br />Dennis Franz has a fine turn as a patient in Maggie's hospital who knows Seth is there because he too was once an Angel. As Seth and he become friends, Seth contemplates how wonderful it would be to truly love Maggie, and searches for the courage to leave heaven behind and, simply fall.<br /><br />This is one of the most romantic movies to come out of Hollywood in decades and has a message about the wonderful things we all take for granted. More than that, it is a story about the importance of love, even one felt for only a moment, for it is that experience which makes us special among all creation. To love is all, and to be loved in return is truly divine.<br /><br />There are some memorable scenes in this romantic and haunting film. One involves the simple act of shopping for fruit at a farmer's market. Another involves Maggie being able to feel Seth in her room but unable to see him. Even Hemingway's Moveable Feast plays a part in this magical throwback film to a bygone era. This is very much a film which could just as easily have been made in the 1930's.<br /><br />I will not ruin the last portion of this film if you have not seen it, but as we all know there is a price we pay for being human. This film is for anyone who has ever loved someone as Seth does, who would trade all eternity for just one breath of her hair. If you have ever loved someone so much your heart ached when they were not with you, then you will be deeply moved by this film. It is painted in broad romantic brushstrokes and colored in rich oils not easily removed from our hearts. This is a truly memorable film you will watch over and over.<br /><br />Films like this are rarely made anymore and this is one to cherish. You will never forget the line: \\"When they ask me what I liked best...I'll say it was You.\\"ruin the last portion of this film if you have not seen it, but as we all know there is a price we pay for being human.

B00005JNQ8|4.0|This movie is suspenseful and full of drama. Nothing here is black or white but plenty of gray. Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who overhears an assasination attempt or is it? Sean Penn plays the skeptical investigator. You constantly ask yourself in this movie. Is anyone who they really are? But you will have fun trying to find out. The ending is real winner.
B0000028M7|5.0|This Album is the definitive heavy metal album of the 90s. Sure AIC get labeled with the Grunge Genre but All AIC frans know that they're more metal than anything. Layne's voice sounds GREAT and Jerry's lyric writing is at its best. Buy this album if your an AIC fan, its a must have for any metalhead.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Sure they digitally remastered a lot of the scenes, even added some extra scenes that we werent able to see years ago. But the story and the movie are the same, as exciting and adreneline rushing as they have always been.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for one DVD set to caputure the magic of the original Star Wars, order it up.
B00000JCOV|3.0|I have been a Slipknot fan since 2002, and I still listen to them today. However, I wouldn't recommend this album at full price. Some tracks are filler, but classics like \\"Wait and Bleed\\" and \\"Surfacing\\" make the disc stand out. A lot of people these days have been giving crap to Slipknot, in which I see no point at all, especially with their matured effort, \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\\". If you just like metal in general, I'd pick this up. Otherwise, I'll just purchase a few tracks off iTunes.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Robert Johnson wrote the blues, sang the blues, and lived the blues.  He died at the tender age of 27, but packed a lifetime of hard living into those several decades.  He only produced eleven albums, a total of 42 tracks, but still earned the moniker 'King of the Delta Blues' before strychnine poisoning proved to be another man's permanent solution to Johnson cheating with his wife.  Johnson obviously walked his talk. <br /> <br />Johnson is viewed by some today as one of the founders of rock music.  While that may be debatable, what isn't in question is his influence on one of the greatest rock performers of all time, Eric Clapton.  Throughout his storied career Clapton has been a devotee and practitioner of the blues, even while his career has diverged into other genres, such as his late 1960's forays into psychedelic rock with Cream and Blind Faith, and his flirtations with reggae music in the 1970's.  Clapton began his career in the blues-oriented hands of The Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, and his song selection has frequently featured renditions of Johnson compositions.  In recent years Clapton has devoted entire albums to the blues, beginning with 1994's 'From the Cradle' and continuing with 2000's B.B. King collaboration, 'Riding With the King'.  But never has Clapton so unashamedly returned to the heart of his inspirations as he does here, putting his own spin on 14 Johnson classics. <br /> <br />I've always found it difficult to immerse myself in blues music, prefering to sample it in small doses.  One of the appeals of Clapton's music for myself has been his mixing of variations in rock music, often turning his albums into musical boxes of chocolates.  His work with Derek and the Dominos, fearuring occasional forays into the blues, suits me best.  'Me and Mr. Johnson' begins to grind on me a bit for that reason, yet Clapton offers a gritty mix of funky-blues ('Stop Breakin' Down Blues' and 'Come On In My Kitchen'), slow-tempo traditional blues ('Little Queen of Spades', 'Kind-Hearted Woman Blues', 'Love In Vain', and 'Hell Hound On My Trail'), and fast-paced, lighter fare ('They're Red Hot', and '32-20 Blues').  All of the songs are performed plugged-in with a thick, bassy sound from the guitars, and just the right mix of harmonica and piano to spice things up. <br /> <br />The best track on the disc is 'If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day', featuring a mesmerizing lead guitar riff as the foundation and a sweet harmonica to make things all the more interesting.  If Johnson performed this song as Clapton does, he's clearly the Godfather of Rock.  Another high point is 'Traveling Riverside Blues', which Clapton drew one of his biggest hits, 'Crossroads', from.   Familar lyrics begin popping up, such as \\"Goin' down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side, we can still barrelhouse baby, 'cause it's on the riverside\\", and \\"...stop breakin' down, the stuff I got will bust your brains out baby, gonna make you lose your mind\\".  Such lyrics mix with more predictable fare for a blues artist, such as \\"I love my baby, my baby don't love me\\" from 'Kind Hearted Woman'. <br /> <br />Clapton undoubtedly has his choice of back-up musicians, and Steve Gadd on drums and Nathan East on bass put up consistantly inspired work.  Jerry Portnoy's harmonica is ever-present, but perfectly nuanced.  Billy Preston and Jim Keltner also make contributions. <br /> <br />Given Johnson's short life and limited output, one would think his impact would be immeasurable, especially given that the time period he lived in, despite the Harlem Renaissance, was uncomplimentary to black artists.  Clapton has proven any such assumptions wrong by producing an audible record of the classic work Johnson wrought.  Clapton himself has said that \\"at first...I could only take it [Johnson's music] in small doses\\".  Thankfully, Eric gradually introduced, and then fully informed, all of us on the breadth of Johnsons influence upon himself and all of rock music.  'Me and Mr. Johnson' is an education as well as entertainment. <br /> <br />
B0007WZUMO|5.0|I own an early version of the album and I can't go through a single day without listening to it at least five times.  Can't wait to own this in 5.1!!  This album has everything and way more than what I ever expected.  I was kind of afraid to listen to it at first because I am a big fan of NIN and I was like how can Trent outdo himself anymore?  Does he have anything left after this long hiatis?  God was I relieved the first time I listened to it!  What is really great about this album is the more you listen to it the better it gets.  You find the lyrics to become more meaningful everytime around that some songs like \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" and \\"With_Teeth\\" almost burns a perminant scar in your soul with how deep they are.  Great stuff!!  I'm not going to go into great detail about every track, but they are all unbelievable and touch so hard!   <br /> <br />Overall With_Teeth flows so well and every song has great value.  People will find that this album will be in the top of their play list for a long time to come.  There is no doubt about it, this album will be the album of 2005 and will eventually become a classic!   Thanks Trent for the gift of real music and another masterpiece.
0790729407|2.0|First of all, a few misunderstandings which a few previous reviewers highlighted:     The Old IRA of the War of Independence were not 'terrorists', as you may find out by looking up definitions of terrorism. Guerrilla wars may involve terrorist actions; however, the war is not directed against the population (naturally enough, because they are supporting the movement) but against the force of occupation. There is (contrary to the assertions of some posters here) no comparison to be drawn with September 11. However, this film blurs these obvious distinctions.    Collins was never, as Jordan misleadingly implies and indeed declares, the leader or creator of the IRA, neither was he the inventor of modern guerrilla warfare. His role in the Irish war of liberation was certainly considerable, but considering the nature of the guerrilla campaign in Ireland, one man was never likely to control it.     This film cannot decide whether it is a 'biopic', a drama or a thriller, and the story, burdened with this indecision, becomes sloppy, confused and sometimes ridiculous. Jordan appears to think that the period of 1919-21 is directly analagous to the later war in Northern Ireland. He seems to suffer under the apprehension that he cannot sympathise with the IRA who fought one of the 20th century's most notorious terrorist gangs, the Auxiliaries/Black and Tans, because to do so would be to sympathise with the modern-day Provisional IRA. On the other hand, he sympathises with his protagonist.     Much of the story's confused feel is owing to this; some also to the fact that he also feels that the antagonist demanded of a drama cannot be English. Hence the raw deal served out to de Valera. It has been suggested that making de Valera's character so despicable eliminates the chance that both Collins's and de Valera's characters would become more complex in relation to the other's. If de Valera is a one-dimensional villain, so Collins too remains static, never generating much sympathyin spite of Liam Neeson's admirable attempts. Similarly, characters such as Harry Boland and Cathal Brugha are mere ciphers of Collins and de Valera's conflict.    The decision to exclude negotiations with the British, possibly necessary in view of Jordan's decision to prevent anyone other than de Valera becoming an antagonist, is a serious gap in the audience's understanding of the issues involved. (You can't just say: \\"Ah Mick, you signed the treaty! You accepted partition!\\" and leave it at that.)     Jordan's portrayal of the decision by Collins to accept the treaty as a heroic attempt to promote peace merely adds to the confusion. He apparently has no problem in using English heavy artillery against his compatriots (and on the order of the British government, let us not forget), but when they fight back, it is a dreadful crime, laden with furtive connivings and hints of murder. Jordan's claim that he did not intend to link de Valera with Collins's death is unconvincing. If the character termed 'Collins' Assassin' is seen acting with de Valera's permission and under his orders, what conclusion does he expect the audience to draw?     There is a frantic energy to the direction which engages the attention, and occasionally the admiration. It raises the speculation that had Jordan (evidently following genre conventions, but not sure which one to stick with) made a decision as to what kind of film he was making, and perhaps decided not to try to explain 20th century Irish history in the gaps between intelligence intrigue and an appalling love story, we might have had a decent film. As it is, the good scenes are too few and far between to make it worth watching, unless some nice cinematography can be said to rescue it.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The lamentation of one star on the above rating is due to the fact that these are all of their NUMBER ONE hits, not necessarily their GREATEST hits.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Not sure what the kid below listened to or where he got his facts (or lack thereof).    Classic, 5 stars. The tighest, most brutal thrash metal album of all time. Precision like playing, one of the most influential metal albums ever. Reign In Blood is still the standard nearly 20 years after it's release. Dave Lombardo is one of the best drummers in any genre.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah's latest CD is truly superb, striking the perfect balance between hot mid-uptempo trakcs and sublime ballads. Complementing the great songs is the top-class production with contributions from Jermaine Dupri, The Neptunes and Kanye West. All the promotion herladed the return of the voice and returned it certainly has. Mariah's voice has always been in a class of its own, but lately fans were concerned with the 'whisper' nature of her voice. Well those fears have well and truly been dispelled. Her voice is powerful and clear - it hasn't sounded this strong in years. We get to hear the entire range - I recently read an apt description of her voice being accurate to at least ten decimal places - that's certainly evident on this album. All the songs demonstrate her vocal proficiency and prowess. The versatility of her voice really shows on the ballads like 'Circles', 'Mine again' and 'I wish you knew'. 'We belong together' is beautiful, it has a great melody, great lyrics and is powerfully sung. The final track, the gospel-tinged 'Fly like a bird' really demonstrates that nobody can sing like Mariah. She really is astounding here.  <br /> <br />The mid and up-tempo tracks are also really strong. 'It's like that' is a great opening track. Mariah and Twista vibe so well together on 'One and only'. The Neptune tracks 'Say something' with Snoop is good and 'To the floor' with Nelly is very catchy. So too is the JD produced 'Got your number'. All hot tracks. For me personally, the Kanye track 'Stay the night' is one of the standout tracks.  <br /> <br />Overall, this album offers polished,contemporary r'n'b songs. There are so many excellent tracks on the album that it's really hard to pick an absolute favourite. What is most exciting about this album is that the focus firmly centers on Mariah's voice and with her voice back in top-notch condition, everything else perfectly falls into place. A must have for your collection.
B00005RHGK|4.0|First of all, Jeepers Creepers is not that bad a movie.  Now, on to the main reason I am writing this quick review.  HorrorMan's 1 star review, and all of his other bs 1 star reviews are nothing more than a moron rambling on amazon.com.  90% of this guys reviews are 1 star reviews, and almost all of them are reviews of horror movies.  I HATE, I mean HATE stupid morons that give 1 star for almost EVERYTHING they \\"review\\".  Horrorman...why don't you go make a horror movie that is up to your \\"standards\\"...?  Oh, that's right, you can't, you are too busy wasting your pathetic life on amazon giving 1 star reviews for other people's work.
B000002NG7|4.0|In My Eyes, ever since Patton Joined Faith no More, they can do no wrong.  While this being my least favorite album by them, it is the LEAST BEST, meaning that it is all amazing, but it isn't as good as angel dust or The Real Thing. <br /> <br />This being the Last Faith No More album really comes with alot of emotional baggage.  The singing is amazing and ballads fill this album to the brinks.  Get this and you'll understand WHY everyone likes faith no more.  Pick up Mr Bungle while you're at it.
068987474X|4.0|There is absolutly nothing revolutionary or complex here to learn about men; and if I'm not mistaken that's exactly the point. When it comes to men and whether or not they are \\"into\\" a woman, we gals do make it far more complicated than it needs to be.  Men are sexually motivated, men who do not want to have sex with you are NOT into you.  Really, everything else Greg says should be required reading by all women/girls prior to entering the dating world.  It would save us all alot of heartache and humiliation.  Honestly ladies, men like to pursue, if they're not, then you know your answer. Okay there are shy men who may require a \\"nudge\\", but honestly any guy who's received the \\"signals\\" from a woman he's interested in will be like a dog with a bone (eg. all over it and not willing to let it go!)
B0007TKNL0|5.0|There is nothing missing in this feature. It is a rich tableau of beauty, grace, chivalry, and yes, tantalizing evil. Actors Emmy Rossum of The Day After Tomorrow and Gerald Butler of Tomb Raider: the Cradle of Life, sing their roles like nightingales. I will never cease to be amazed at the versatility of talent and the quality that these actors bring to the table. The rest of the cast is of a similar calibre.<br /><br />Rossum is the picture of innocence and Butler that of seduction. Together, they make your hear beat faster. Then the good guy comes along and Schumacher, the director, succeeds in making you torn between the two men. Who will win the angel's heart? Butler achieves the consummate: pain has never looked so good on a man! Bravo to all the cast and crew.
B00000JG41|5.0|This Album defintely has that Sound Track feel to it.  which makes it perfect.  All of it is amazing and off the wall.  that is why I love this band so much, each album is totally different from the last and you can't expect ANYTHING at all from them, except that it is going to be amazing in some way or another. <br /> <br />Get this album only because Patton is in it, and because it is an amazing piece of musical artwork.
B00068IOWM|3.0|I noticed that the first two pages of reviews for U2's latest album are almost entirely made up of one-star ratings, and it almost made me sick. But I just want to clear things up for the lovers AND haters of this CD: no, I'm not a hardcore fan of the band; and no, I didn't rate this less than four stars because it's no Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure where the title How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb came from, but at any rate, this is a pretty decent album. The album starts out with \\"Vertigo\\", which had to grow on me for some reason (and I know this is old news, but...did Bono forget how to count?). Other good songs include \\"Yahweh\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" and my favorite, \\"All Because of You\\". And \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a wonderful I'll-be-there-for-you track that doesn't sound so clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />To be honest, though, this album is half-good, half-okay. And there are a couple of missteps. As good as \\"Miracle Drug\\" is, it sounds just like \\"Beautiful Day\\"; and \\"Original of the Species\\" makes no sense at all. Anyway, while this isn't U2's best album, it's definitely not a bomb, so if you're a more open-minded consumer like I am, then you won't be mad that you picked this up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert<br /><br />P.S. In response to another reviewer, \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is the third single off this album, not the second (\\"All Because of You\\" was the second).
B00006IU73|4.0|All I have to say is that this album is so relaxing.  i have it in my playlist next to Opeth and Dying Fetus.  This is defintely a good album to get especially if you like Radio Head, Floyd, and Opeth.  For some reason they all just blend together.  Also Bright Eyes goes with it in some way.  If you're a stoner you'll understand. <br /> <br />Get this album, you won't regreat it at all.
0385510454|4.0|I've always been a bit skittish when it comes to reading courtroom dramas, which is what Grisham is known for. But, when I read the jacket of \\"The Broker\\", and having been a fan of the espionage novel, I thought I'd give this a shot. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />It's a fun read, for sure. As Grisham admits, he's no author of spy books, and this was something \\"different\\" for him. So, don't read this expecting the all-out, gun-toting action of Ludlum, or the piercing character development of LeCarre.<br /><br />If you're a fan of fun summer reads, this will do very nicely. It's well-written, and doesn't make you feel too smart, or too dumb like some other books tend to do.<br /><br />The one thing that actually sticks out for me, is that Grisham points out a LOT of setting points. Italian customs, weather almanac, that sort of thing. So, you actually feel like you're sitting in an Italian cafe, or learning Italian.<br /><br />All in all, a really good book, though not fantastic. People who love Italy will love it most.<br /><br />Happy Reading!!
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork's third album is the culmination of two emotional years compressed into 10 beautiful tracks. The cover has a tinge of emotion,even. So much contrast in one album is hard to come to terms with. Bjork's albums usually take a couple of listens to truly appreciate, but this one only took one and I was hooked.<br /><br />She shows wide versatility on this album, with sliding strings and grating dance beats.You will love this album, I promise.<br /><br />She shows so much tenacity in her voice and immerses herself fully into the song. That is why so many people like Bjork because of her genius, that shows well on this album.

B000005DSN|1.0|Up until 2005, I had never heard of Stratovarius. After listening to Visions, I now know why. What is this album? I went back and listened again. I do feel that Visions is their best work up to date, including their newer releases. However, there best work is cabbage. I would describe Visions as video game soundtrack material where the game producers are trying to Mock the 1980's cheesy metal scene. It's hilarious, actually. The Track \\"Forever Free\\" made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br />I think it's the vocals that turn this album into something I can't take seriously. Every time I hear that voice, I bust up. Total Cheese Whiz. Where's that hotdog? <br /> <br />The most potential with Visions are the drums and the beats. The rhythms are quite good and really involve you. <br /> <br />Statovarius? No.  <br /> <br />Next question. <br />
0671027387|5.0|Deception Point<br /><br />When Intelligence Analyst Rachel Sexton was sitting aboard Air Force One, after agreeing to the President's request to verify the authenticity of a NASA discovery of \\"such scientific importance... such earth-shattering significance... that it validated every dollar Americans have ever spent in space\\", she had no idea some very powerful people would soon be using an array of remarkable weapons to try to kill her.  This is how the opening scenes of Dan Brown's Deception Point (first published in 2001 by Pocket Books) unfold, leading to a 5-star thrill ride that combines scientific deception with cut-throat political maneuvering.  After her meeting with the President, Rachel is taken to the scene of the NASA discovery, which she soon discovers is a hoax; in trying to reveal this fact it is clear that someone in the establishment does not want her to succeed and a life or death chase commences on the Arctic ice shelf and continues on a sinking ocean research vessel, and concludes in Washington.  On occasion Dan Brown takes the excitement a little too far, particularly in the climax on the ocean where I thought the underwater volcano was unnecessary, but otherwise the science is believable and combines well with the sinister political double-dealing that provides the other main theme of the novel; this unusual mixture of science, politics, action, adventure and betrayal has produced a thoroughly entertaining book.<br /><br />As with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", another of Dan Brown's novels, there are many well researched facts in Deception Point that make the novel believable while you are reading it, even if it seems somewhat far fetched when you look back at it.  In fact the opening scenes of Deception Point require less of a leap of faith by the reader than those of The Da Vinci Code, which are almost bizarre by comparison.  By basing a thriller on scientific facts Dan Brown reminds me of Michael Crichton.  Even the science that gives rise to the dinosaurs of Crichton's Jurassic Park is believable, and so it is with Deception Point.  As Rachel Sexton and her colleagues slowly unravel the hoax Dan Brown manages to explain the obscure facts they use to do so in such a way that, even if they are pure science-fiction, he has me believing.  There were times however when I thought Brown was stretching credibility a little too far particularly with the introduction of things such as weapons that fire ice bullets, and super-fast hydrogen powered aircraft.  Oddly it is the use of an underwater volcanic eruption, the existence of which is certainly unquestionable, that seems to be unnecessary and, by the boundaries set earlier in the novel, most unbelievable; the scenes on the sinking research vessel are already so suspenseful and dramatic that I felt let down by this plot twist.  It is almost as if Brown had backed the story into a corner and had to resort to this remarkable plot twist to rescue his hero.<br /><br />No such plot twists are required to keep the suspense going in the scenes in Washington.  While Rachel is racing to expose NASA's deception, we are also following the unraveling of political deception back in the capital.  Rachel's father (for whom she has little respect) is an ambitious senator, whose Presidential campaign is gathering pace after making criticism of the government's wasteful spending on NASA its cornerstone.  Consequently the announcement of NASA's earth-shattering discovery would appear to mark the death knell of his presidential ambitions.  However, it is not that simple and Dan Brown has weaved an equally complicated web of deception in Washington to match the one in the Arctic.  Gabrielle Ashe, Senator Sexton's assistant, discovers he has been taking illegal campaign contributions from the private sector space industry in return for promising, if elected, to privatize space exploration, something he has been publicly critical of.  While Gabrielle is secretly gathering more evidence ofthese contributions she discovers a desperate fax from Rachel exposing the NASA hoax, and pleading for her father's help to save her life.  Gabrielle is amazed that the Senator plans to ignore his daughter's plea and instead use an expos&eacute; of NASA's hoax to resurrect his campaign.  Although these scenes in Washington are less action packed than the scenes involving Rachel's escape from the Arctic, Dan Brown still manages to make them dramatic.  The fact that the level of deceit and the corruption portrayed in these scenes does not seem excessive is probably a sad reflection of politics in the 21st century.<br /><br />By frequently switching between the corruption in Washington and Rachel's increasingly desperate struggle, and by keeping the scenes short, the novel is written at a pace that is fast without being breathless.  Switching scenes frequently also creates a series of mini \\"cliffhangers\\" that encourage the reader to continue reading.  Of course, though, the pace keeps building as it leads to the final climax, as it should.  Scene switching also offers the chance for further plot twists; we know very early on of the existence of the Delta squad and their potentially deadly intent, but the identity of their controller is carefully left in doubt until much later.  Even the mastermind of the hoax is hidden until late in book, and is a surprise because of the way the author has led us to believe we have seen all the behind the scenes activity in Washington.  Any fan of good thriller writers such as Crichton, Robert Ludlum and Frederick Forsythe, will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Deception Point is a tremendously enjoyable thriller.  While not quite \\"unputdownable\\" I certainly looked forward to picking it up whenever I had the opportunity; it is not a classic to read over and over but it is great entertainment.  In other words it is not an intellectual book about the science of meteorites or NASA funding, and it is more Hollywood blockbuster than art house movie, but it is fun.  Once this is accepted, Deception Point does not disappoint.hese contributions she discovers a desperate fax from Rachel exposing the NASA hoax, and pleading for her father's help to save her life.

In other words it is not an intellectual book about the science of meteorites or NASA funding, and it is more Hollywood blockbuster than art house movie, but it is fun.  Once this is accepted, Deception Point does not disappoint. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a hardcore Sci-fi buff for many years, I have tolerated a lot of crap - material lacking plot, character development, consistent worlds that SOMEHOW got renewed for 4-6 seasons. Firefly was a casualty of short-sighted decisions by FOX execs and programmers.<br /><br />Firefly is a tongue-in-cheek, wonderfully-crafted romp of a sci-fi western. After each episode concluded, I would sit there, wowed. When the series was over all too soon, I sincerely hoped that some studio exec would hunt Joss Whedon down, give him a budget worthy of the storyline, and let him finish it up, right.<br /><br />Update, 2006-7-19: Well, Look at that! While I don't imagine the execs read this review, Whedon got a chance to finish the tale. Firefly was reborn as the feature film, Serenity, released in the fall of 2005. It is a spectacular and fitting completion to the series. Watch all of Firefly, in sequence, then Serenity.
B00005JLEU|5.0|spirited away is like a dream. i espescially like the pure emotion put into this film.  Director Hayao Miyazaki poured his heart and soul into making this movie a special experience for its viewers. i like the way he connected the real world with the imaginary by plucking real live personalities, studying their emotions and then inserting them into this amazing piece of work as hand drawn charachters. that is another thing i like about this film, it wasnt made by some barely pubescent teen with a computer, it was made by teamwork of a large staff working, eating and socialising within gimli studio. what suprises me is that a film of this magnitude started with Miyazaki meeting a bored unsociable 10 year old daughter of his friend. Miyazaki observed the girl and concluded that he must makke a movie that is interesting to 10 year olds. he wanted to show them they werent just short teens forgotten near the floor, he wanted to excite them into taking a more active role in their lives. THANK YOU MIYAZAKI FOR THIS WONDERFULL FILM, AND THANK YOU AMAZON FOR GIVING ME A CHANCE TO WATCH IT!!!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Admittedly, I was initially a bit disappointed in this one.  I thought possibly they would delve a bit more into the young Obi-Wan. In fact, when it first came out on DVD, I didn't even want to own it. The worst part of movie for me was the overlong Podrace, while a great special effects masterpiece, it really broke away from the main plotline.  <br />I beg to differ with those who do not buy the idea of the sense of the Force being an inherited ability; if they will recall towards the end of Episode IV, when Luke is trying to blow up the Deathstar, Vader says he feels the force is strong in him.  Since we all know that Luke is Vader's son, then we must conclude that he inhereted his sensativity to the Force. <br />As to the character of Jar Jar, I found him rather funny. <br />The acting for the most part was pretty good.I loved Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan and I have always liked Liam Neeson. He played the part of a Jedi Master very well. <br />Maybe you have to look at this movie as part of the whole series to appreciate where Lucas is going with it.  Watch Episode II and you might like this movie a little more.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I remember seeing this the day it came out in the theatres. Mind you, my friends & I planned on seeing something else (don't even remember what movie it was, it was so long ago), but it was sold out. So was our second choice. Our only option was to see the newly-released The Terminator, or go do something else. We nearly did something else 'cuz the trailers for The Terminator were flat-out lame...even the name \\"The Terminator\\" seemed kinda hokey. But we said \\"what the hell\\" and bought some tickets. There were maybe 10-15 other people in the theatre when the lights went down...not exactly opening night numbers to be popping champagne over. But I'll tell you what...when we walked out after it ended, my friends & I were SHOUTING at anyone who'd listen to GO SEE THIS MOVIE. NOW. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so jazzed & amped after seeing a flick...the original Star Wars, maybe?? We even bonded a little bit with the other 10-15 people, who were just as gleeful as we were...I mean, we felt like we stumbled across the mother lode of \\"best kept secrets\\"...LOL Apparently our small group must've not been the only ones who overly gushed about The Terminator, 'cuz in short order it became a smash hit at the box office. Years later, it still sucks me in like few other sci-fi thrillers. I know alot of folks say T2 is the best of the trilogy (and there's no denying it's a DAMN good film), but the original is BY FAR the cream of the crop...the effects might not be quite as sophisticated as T2 & T3, but it's darker, creepier, more suspenseful, and--dare I say it--more believable. If you've never seen the original Terminator, be prepared for a hell of a ride...
B00000IQMT|5.0|Once again, John Williams has given us an excellent score.  The \\"Duel of the Fates\\" tract is fantastic and is perfect for the background in the final duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. <br /> <br />Anyone who loved the original trilogy music should enjoy this one as well. I give this one 10 stars!
B00005JM0B|3.0|as long as you detach yourself from the first two Terminator movies, you might realize \\"hey, this ain't such a bad flick\\". Super action sequences and great effects make this an enjoyable popcorn flick. However, T3 sorely lacks the depth of both T1 & T2, so its unlikely that you'll get sucked into the storyline or get attached to any of the characters. And another thing...if this is the THIRD time the machines have had to travel back in time, you'd think they might take a quicker, no-nonsense approach this time around, considering they already went 0-for-2. I mean, why not just show up unannounced & drop a few bombs in whatever neighborhood John Connor lives in, and be done with it? No one (including Connor) would know what hit 'em. Wait, I think I know the answer to that...there's no money to be made by Hollywood execs. But gripes aside, T3 is worth checking out. It's deserving of 3 stars based on the action sequences alone, but admittedly is inferior to T1 & T2...
0060920084|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"In a Sunburned Country\\", \\"Made in America\\" and \\"Neither Here Nor There\\", but this book really rubbed me the wrong way.  In my opinion it is 299 pages of complaining and whining.  In this book Mr. Bryson comes across as being almost anti-American, and also a homophobe.  I'm all for sarcasm and biting humor, and agree than America's propensity to build superhighways and strip malls and \\"main drags\\" with car dealerships and fast food joints is tiresome, but this book kind of crosses the line into a bitterness that is not enjoyable to read.  If I were given the chance to take months off work to travel the route that Mr. Bryson did in this book, I would have had a great time!  Mr. Bryson sure didn't - every place was boring and filled with a bunch of hicks.  It appears that Mr. Bryson was wishing he was in Europe, or somewhere else.  The fact that he might have been going through a difficult time in his life seems to me to come across in this book.  Who wants to read the unhappy travel writer?
B00005JN0T|4.0|Caveat: I am not an Asimov or sci-fi purist.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, especially the special effects. It's a very imaginative and suspenseful story. Lots of action. Surround sound/DTS is great. Sonny the robot rules -- and steals the show. Beltrami's soundtrack is excellent. VERY strong 4 stars for this.
B000002WYT|5.0|If you're a longtime DMB fan, you shouldn't have to look at other people's reviews.  You know that you have unique favorites and some songs don't appeal at first to beginners.  This review is for those who are new to DMB: <br /> <br />1. So Much To Say - 7/10 - Welcoming guitar rythm, catchy      beat.  I recommend downloading it for beginners. <br />    <br />2. Two Step - 10/10 - Incredible. The intro sets up the song beautifully for the famous \\"Celebrate we will\\" chorus.  Many fans' all-time favorite song. <br /> <br />3. Crash Into Me - 8/10 - You've probably heard it. Radio friendly song.  <br /> <br />4. Too Much - 7/10 - Jazzy uptempo song. Another good one. <br />  <br />5. #41 - 9/10 - One of my favorites along with Two Step.  So smooth, so good. <br />   <br />6. Say Goodbye - 7/10 - Not for beginners. Although it is undoubtly a great song, it takes time to appreciate it. <br />  <br />7. Drive In Drive Out - 6/10 - For beginners. It will appeal for the first listen, but after a while it falls down the ranks as others move up. But there isn't a poor song on this cd anyways. <br /> <br />8. Let You Down - 6/10 - Not one of their most well acclaimed songs. Skip it. <br /> <br />9. Lie In Our Graves - 9/10 - I love it. Loved by everyone I know. Highly recommended. You can't go wrong.  <br />  <br />10. Cry Freedom - 7/10 - Not great, but not bad.  If you're a new fan, stick to other songs. <br />    <br />11. Tripping Billies - 9/10 - Another great song.  Upbeat, and loved by everyone. <br />  <br />12. Proudest Monkey - 8/10 - A long mellow song. Not bad though.   <br /> <br />In conclusion, this albums is a good place to start.  So Much To Say, Two Step, Crash, Too Much, #41, Lie In Our Graves, and Trippin Billies are songs that should be listened to first.
0316172324|3.0|I read a brief review of this book and it sounded like an interesting read. I tend to always look for an author's previous work before buying the current bestseller. To my surprise Gladwell's other work was also a bestseller...still!!! <br />So I read Tipping Point, it was a very quick read and very entertaining to me. However, that being said it still was getting very bad reviews here on Amazon. I kept thinking that maybe I'd put off Blink until it comes down in price and/or came out in paperback. All of that was about 2 months ago. In the meantime, I've read three other books and found myself in a Amazon dry spell (Waiting for 4 new books to be delivered). So I went over to my local price club and picked up Blink for $17 dollars. I liked Tipping Point, I thought it was engaging up until the end where it dragged slightly but I suspect it was the rehashing that caused that. Anyway, Blink is a little different in that it starts to become bogged down halfway through, not because of the rehashing (Which it does plenty of) but because Gladwell chooses to insert a message into the book. I'm not against it and I don't want to turn others off because I think the book is still a good product. It was very obvious to me that the tone of the book changes and vears from an exploration into a dissertation on certain unfortunate facts of life that effect everyone. But the tone and message do make the argument very one sided and doesn't even begin to consider the other point of view. Both books are good reads and will not hurt you or make you feel like a lemming, unless of course you let yourself feel that way. I believe that's why so many people have left very terrible reviews here. They feel betrayed by themselves because they expected to get a better read. The venom is unneccasary... Move on.  I do suspect though that Gladwell will make a trilogy and will tie all together. Hence Gladwell's Journey.
B0000AUHPB|1.0|I'd read about this movie for years in my British movie magazines. Apparently it's an institution over there. I can't imagine why. It's a badly dated film that plods along without any discernable humor or wit. Most of the dialogue is just characters endlessly explaining the plot, which still makes little sense despite all this exposition.     The direction is badly paced and unfocused and the actors are eithed adrift or worse, like the talentless girl who plays Caine's girlfriend and sounds like she's reading her lines off cuecards while stoned. Yes she's gorgeous, but couldn't they have found a girl who could look good and also believably portray a human being.    I wanted to turn this thing off by ten minutes in, but forced myself to keep it on in hopes that it would improve. It didn't. Avoid this at all costs, it's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back.
6305428557|5.0|The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain is the greatest English comedy set in a small village in Wales. Its about a mountain that is actually a hill, but is so beloved by its people, that they are willing to put some thousand feet of milage on it, just so it will earn the respect of the surrounding countryside. That, and the man who is measuring it. Hugh Grant.<br /><br />Hugh doesn't understand at first why the people are taking such an adamanet side on behalf of the hill, but gradually he is influenced by the small town comraderie and decides to help. That, and the fact that he has fallen hard for the lovely maid Tara Fitzgareld.<br /><br />What the deciding outcome is I won't relate, its better to see for yourself. This is a lovely movie in every sense of the word. The countryside is gorgeous, the music wondeful, and the perfomances humerous to say the least.<br /><br />Besides, who wouldn't want to watch Hugh Grant?
B0006HXXBA|5.0|this cd is just filled with complete brilliants  <br />i wish they would have started out this good <br />just the combination of elements for a good thrash album are here <br />so i suggest if you like or love thrash metal buy this album
B000002GQH|4.0|Although perhaps not as good as the two previous albums (\\"Days of Future Passed\\" and \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\") nor the subsequent one (\\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\"), \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" nevertheless holds its own as one of the great first seven albums of the Hayward-Lodge led Moody Blues.  To me, \\"In the Beginning\\" is a frivolous version of the beginning of Genesis with technology thrown in, but the last 30 seconds or so serve as a fine introduction to the best song on the album \\"Lovely to See You\\" which clearly proves once again that Justin Hayward is the best songwriter in the group.  When Hayward/Lodge/Thomas/Pinder sing together, the song really takes off.  I love the stanza, \\"tell us what you've seen, in far away forgotten lands, where empires have turned back to sand.\\"    After \\"Lovely to See You,\\" though, the album is a bit uneven.  I really don't care for the two Thomas entries, and think that the Pinder song \\"So Deep Within You\\" is simply annoying and not worthy to be on this album (why wasn't Pinder's powerful \\"Simple Game\\" recorded instead?). The two Lodge songs are average (have you ever noticed that the beginning riff on \\"To Share Our Love\\" is similar to that of \\"Victoria\\" by the Kinks?).  On the other hand, the Hayward/Thomas collaboration, \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably,\\" with its references to the Arthurian legend, is wonderful and moving, and is almost equaled by Hayward's \\"Never Comes the Day.\\"  The close of the album, consisting of Edge's \\"The Word\\" and Pinder's \\"Have You Heard\\" and \\"The Voyage,\\" works for me, but I could see why others might find it over-the-top.    Overall, \\"Threshold\\" is a fine album, which highlights some of the best attributes of the Moody Blues, all of which would be enhanced on their brilliant, under-rated, next album, \\"To Our Children's Children's Children.\\"
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles are at the top of their game in 'Revolver'. It's the perfect album to begin your Beatles collection if you are a new fan. It's the CD to pop in and listen to over and over again for the veteran fans. Why is this CD so good you ask? It's because this is probably the only Beatles' CD with virtually no filler songs. Almost every track on this CD is good and ofcourse, a majority of them are exceptional :) <br /> <br />Absolute classics: <br />* Taxman - George Harrison rocks in this intro track! <br />* Here There and Everywhere - Paul's romantic classic. <br />* She said She said - My absolute fave track on this album! John Lennon was a genius! I can listen to this song endlessly! <br />* And your bird can sing - Great Guitar riffs! This track short and sweet.. John's magic again! <br />* For no one - Paul's best track on the album. <br />* Tomorrow Never Knows - What a way to end this magnificient CD! The Beatles sign off with a truly outstanding experimental track that is more psychedelic than anything I've heard! <br /> <br />COMPARISONS.. to Beatles' other albums does no good! Each album defined a phase in Beatles evolution as artists and probably this is the CD which captures them in their very finest form. Everyone should give this CD a try. After all, it is one of the best CDs by one of the greatest bands ever.. The Beatles.
076790592X|5.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" by Mitch Albom <br /> \\"So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important.\\" A college professor gives valuable lessons to his student right before his death. Mitch Albom's book, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" deserves a five-star rating for the fact that it is inspirational and filled with some of life's important lessons. Perhaps, deep down inside we already know these lessons, but for many they are dormant. This book awakens the best in all of us.  <br />The author Mitch Albom narrates a touching true story about his professor, Morrie Schwartz with whom he reunites after 16 years. Morrie has been dealt with a terminal illness that gives him only six months to live. During this short period, Mitch a sports reporter receives the most important lessons that will change his way of living. For the next six months, every Tuesday afternoon, Mitch visits Morrie at his home; they talk about their life experiences and lessons that should be learned. Mitch is a very private person who does not know how to express his feelings. He is always busy with work and never has enough time to enjoy life. The professor teaches Mitch how to live life to the fullest. He teaches him about giving and forgiving, and about the importance of marriage and family.          <br />Although Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a beautifully written book, filled with so much wisdom, I would have liked to have known more about Morrie's early work experience, and more about his personal life, his wife, and children.                                                                  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book because the story brings out so many emotions and makes one reflect on one's own life. Clearly it brings to the surface all the importance of life: love, compassion, forgiveness; the tools needed for living a well-balanced life, especially in a world that is so busy. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is worded in such a tender way that one cannot stop reading; it warms one inside and leaves a long lasting impression that should be passed on to others, one of love and kindness, the valuable lessons of life.  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|If you have never listen to nirvana like me, then you will Definitely not like it the first time.  Quite honesty, it took me about 7 times listening to it nonstop to actually understand it.  It not that it bad, but it actually hard to hear Kurt Cobain sing.   <br /> <br />After listening to it nonstop, i would have to say that NIRVANA are AWESOME! <br /> <br />I can't believe i like grudge so much now.   <br /> <br />The thing about music is having to listen to it a lot of time before you get it.  I never gave up and you shouldn't to. <br /> <br />This was a change of pace from the usual pop/punk like good charlotte and the loud screaming of system of a down.   <br /> <br />Now on to the review: simply put: it brilliant!  I'm a nirvana fan for life now!  This is a must buy!  So even if you are a poser like me (darn proud, when was being different a bad thing, at least i have courage to admit it) and like good charlotte and the like, you can still like nirvana. <br /> <br />In conclusion all the 12 song on this cd is rockin' AWESOME!  My personal favorite is smell like teen spirit.  This is a different approach from the usual pop/punk, emo and even the ramone, but grudge is a great music genre. <br /> <br />I hope this help.  Remember to listen to it more than one time!  <br />
B0007OCG56|4.0|Adam Sandler continues to surprise. Tea Leoni rises to the challenge, and Paz is a great discovery. I agree with most other reviewers that this film was heavily mis-marketed. It was a romantic drama with comedic elements. This is what happens when you try to do something different in Hollywood. Where its true that Spanglish avoids a pat ending-I think this is the first time that I'm actually rooting for the hero to leave his wife. And its solely because James L. Brooks refused to give Tea any redeeming qualities. Simply put, her husband was way too good for her. Her confession of misbehaving and the subsequent tears felt like another level manipulation. She never asked or try to understand how her actions affected her husband--or how her actions affected anyone.  Yes, I understand this might very well reflect a certain level realism-but in the land of movies, characters, at some point in the storytelling, are suppose to have a character arc and change.  Take Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as it Gets (antoher James L. Brooks creation) All the characters change or grow during the course of the story.  In THIS story, everyone stays exactly the same--and in return-its an unremarkable journey.<br /><br />Mrs. C refused to the end to hold up a mirror to herself or bear any blame. Just when you think she's cornered-she then turns to her mother and say-this is all your fault. Even now, I'm thinking-this man chose to live the rest of days with this lunatic. He deserved better than that.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce (daughter) was adorable-and I understand the sacrifice was his feelings for his family. But what type of family are we talking about when you have a looney, self-servant mom at the helm?<br /><br />I was rooting for Flor to show up that night, snatch her daughter back, and open a good old fashion can of whoop arse.  Now that's a level of realism I can deal with.<br /><br />Good film-but I wished for a better and more satisfying ending.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|First, adjust your expectations and open your mind and you'll be fine as you watch this first-rate movie. Secondly, could reviewers please separate opinions of Mr. Penn OFFSCREEN from his performance ON SCREEN and just concentrate on the movie, the art itself? No fair panning a movie because you don't like the way a guy conducts himself at the Oscars - or whatever. Thanks.<br /><br />  Now, as to that movie... Nicolle Kidman plays Silvia, a U.N. interpreter and her motives are left somewhat unclear for a good part of his movie. Is she truly someone who has overheard what she should not and is the target of bad guys? Or is she possibly one of the bad guys, with her own, complicated agenda, one she can't own up to?<br /><br /> Penn plays Keller, a federal agent who is sent to figure out what is going on and separate truth from speculation and his emotional tension is palpable. In fact, tension, suspense and paranoia are major elements of this film, which was plenty strong enough to hold my interest.<br /><br /> But I was also riveted by the personal pain of the main characters. Keller has lost his wife, Sivia has lost much of her family (I don't want to give away too much of the plot so I'm being intentionally cryptic here, better you watch it unfurl yourself).<br /><br />  I'm sure the movie will get mixed reviews as it wasn't without flaws (it isn't formulaic and it does challenge the viewer; some people don't like that) but I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me think of the ramifications of all sorts of political scenarios and \\"what ifs?\\" and it haunted me for days, burrowing into my subconscious and bringing up ideas and impressions at odd moments. I love films like that, the ones that stay with you long beyond the drive home from the theatre.
B000068QY7|4.0|My first introduction to Oasis was morning glory. After that I got definitely maybe. Then i simultaneously got this and be here now. Both of those albums took more time than definitely maybe and morning glory to enjoy, but I love them both. I really enjoy this CD, and the only reason I'm not giving it a five is because it doesn't flow quite as well as their first two CD's. And, afterall, it is Oasis. Little by Little is mr favorite on here, and easily in the top 5 songs they have ever written. stop crying your heart out is a great slow-tempo song, beautiful but ear-grabbing. I like songbird, a sweet short little ditty penned by liam, which is unusual. If you're first getting into oasis, i would recommend morning glory or perhaps definitely maybe. but if you're already a fan, I highly recommend this album.

B00005JNVS|4.0|Having seen Stephen Chow gone from goofy TV star in the late '80s, to becoming the king of comedy of Hong Kong with a long list of box office hits since the early '90s, it's great to see him combining jokes, outlandish special effects, and Kung Fu in this film that is by far his most entertaining work, even better than Shaolin Soccer. This is no doubt Granddaddy Sing's(his nickname) most ambitious movie, since it had already conquered the box office in all Chinese cinemas as well in most Asian countries. Finally, his movie is getting to be launched in North America in wide release. Let's see if it'll kick ass like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br /><br />Since I have already acquired Sing(Stephen Chow's) style of comedy and action for film, I know it's not going to be a Jackie Chan or Jet Li kind of action/comedy. He's very much on a league of his own, so he's got something different to offer the foreign audiences. Fans of Jim Carrey will very likely dig Sing's movie, because the two actors have been compared a lot.<br /><br />The movie is about the war between The Axe Gang and The Pig Sty Alley, and Sing is pretending to be an amateur while seeking<br /> to become a member of the Axe Gang. There are some very powerful retired masters of Kung Fu Warriors living as normal residents in The Pig Sty Alley. The Tailor, The Coolie(handyman), and The Baker all have great power and skills, but have not use them until the intrusion of The Axe Gang. They defeated the gang effortlessly. The Axe Gang then hired The # 1 Killers(two men who use musical instrument to produce deadly melodies as their weapon) to fight against the Alley. Just when they had defeated the three defendents of the Valley, The Landlord and his wife The LandLady came out to show them some serious kung fu. The Landlord's special power is his body movement that can be bent like elastic, so his opponent cannot hit him easily. As for The Landlady, she can ran like a motorcycle, and her ultimate power is her voice(a skill known as The Lion's Roar). Sing was hired by the Gang to go help The Beast escape the mental Assylum, so that he can fight against The Alley. The Beast was known to be the best of the best in the world of kung fu, and he was in the Assylum because he had defeated everyone already. The Landlady and The Landlord were caught off guard when The Beast appeared. They thought they were the best in kung fu, and now they have to face the enemy of a life time. Who will save them if they failed?<br /><br />Wah Yuen(Landlord) and Qiu Yuen(Landlady) are very good together, and they delivered the laughs and great battle scenes. Qiu Yuen is actually very striking, espeically when she had the funniest lines and a outrageous personality. Other supporting players including the goofy Gang Leader(Danny Chan), and Tailor provided with some funny moments. The scene when Tailor was prancing around wearing a pair of red underwear seen through in a pair transparent pants, and got mocked by Landlady was a comic relief. The Lollipop Girl was unerexposed here, and I was expecting to see her practicing some special candy power, but she's just Sing's love interest. The action direction from renowned martial arts veteran Yuen Woo Ping certainly made the fight scenes over-the-top here. Along with a ton of special effects, it's very captivating, even if it looked kind of cartoonish at times.<br /><br />Stephen Chow didn't totally dominate the movie like his other films, and he allowed the supporting cast enough screentime, so that the group scenes are worthwhile. In fact, I didn't find him to be as funny as his previous films. He's more serious, and his fight scenes have improved a great deal, considered that he's not an action star.ll known as The Lion's Roar).

B00081PPX8|1.0|I'm just writing this review to bring the star average down so less people think of buying this obvious rip off. Don't waste your time or money.

B000001DQG|4.0|From 1970 to 1973, Elton John produced a body of studio work on par with the finest material anybody has ever recorded over a comparable time span.  By the time 1974's \\"Caribou\\" appeared, EJ was a fixture in the pop-music stratosphere.  This album was released as a launch pad for EJ's much-anticipated world concert tour, and given this backdrop, may explain the relative simplicity of many of the tunes contained here.  To be sure, this collection lacks the variety of tone and texture that made its immediate predecessor, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" such a satisfying listening experience, but one shouldn't sell \\"Caribou\\" short.  In addition to its signature offering, the monstrously popular \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\"---this set is uniformly tuneful, and contains two of EJ's most memorable rockers, the chart-topping hit \\"The Bitch is Back\\" and the driving \\"She's So Static,\\" both songs propelled by the stellar horn section of Tower of Power. By contrast, the love song \\"Pinky\\" features a lovely melody (the lyrics are to some a bit sappy).  \\"Stinker\\" is an earthy blues with a funny lyric that features the pulsating bass of Dee Murray (the TOP horns again contribute here).  \\"Ticking\\" stands as one of Elton's most memorable epic story-telling ballads---excellent piano accents punctuate the discordant theme.  \\"I've Seen the Saucers\\" successfully mocks the early 70's media obsession with the UFO phenomenon, and is also appropriately \\"spacey\\" in musical terms.  \\"Dixie Lily\\" is a tribute to a paddle-boat, the customary country-tinged offering on this album, while \\"Grimsby\\" extolls the virtues of seaside village life.  Both songs are of the \\"hum-along\\" variety---melodic but without high distinction. This album has suffered much criticism for not meeting the lofty standards of EJ's preceding albums, but such comparative judgments are much too harsh in the present case.  \\"Caribou\\" is straight-ahead stuff...nothing really complex here, but middle-of-the-road Elton is still ofa quality that eclipses the best offerings of most of his contemporaries.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I'm so sad that this show is leaving us after such a short life. But fear not fans because they will live long in beautiful long lasting DVD. I liked this show from the beginning and thought it was well done, Scott Bakula was a great captain and the rest of the crew was well cast. The early episodes were actually pretty good for a new show and I was quickly impressed. The effects were great and the set design was top notch. I have had this item on pre-order for quite a while now and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival. I've been a fan of Star Trek since I was a little girl watching re-runs on our 13 channel TV and have watched every movie/spin off series that has come around, some were better than others but all were satisfying and carried their own. Maybe there will be a movie in the future, hey one can hope right?
0812550706|5.0|I have read a lot of Science Fiction books, and I believe that this genre is one of the best (You get insight on the human mind through experimenting with extreme circumstances).  Anyway, I was going to read this book for awhile, but never thought it would interest me.  I heard it was amazing, but never wanted to read it.  One day I decided to pick it up, and the rest is history.  This book was intelligent, thought-provoking, and fast-paced.  It told of people going through extreme challenges and how they delt with that.  It was great, I don't want to give anything away, but if you like science fiction you have to read this book.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Sometimes when someone believes so obsessively in a certain philosophy it becomes hard for that person to destinguish between opinions and facts. What one needs to keep in mind is that the \\"facts\\" cannot \\"speak for themselves\\" (as the editorial review says) if they are not believable as true facts or not sufficiently proven. The viewpoint in the film is weakly presented and seems to be based more on what Moore wants to be true than what he can prove to be true. The argument is tenuous and juvenile and reasoning is often subsituted by low and base satire, the kind that could be made of anyone (for example, footage of Paul Wolfowitz combing his hair with saliva or superimposing the heads of the party members on cowboys). The great irony is that Michael Moore never seems to consider the possible humor of filming a hypothetical documentary of himself trying reach around his fat to his less readily accessible parts in the shower or trying to fit into his briefs in the morning. The true shallowness of the film can be seen in one scene in particular, the scene where Moore is standing outside the congressional building passing out military enlistment flyers to congressmen asking them if they want their children to enlist. After a few hours of doing this, to the point where congressmen become annoyed with him and run away, he triumphantly concludes that his prediction was correct, that the congressmen would be repulsed by the flyers (although the thought probably never crossed Moore's mind that it may have been him repulsing the congressmen rather than the the flyers). The bottom line is that Moore seems to assume that proof is not necesary, that all people everywhere will automatically agree with him and the liberal doctrine and do not need to be presented with a mature argument of why they should follow it. I am sure that many Moore-ist liberals will go ahead and vote this review \\"not helpful\\" simply out of suspicion that I disagree with the film, but there are no \\"facts\\"in it that \\"speak for themselves.\\" The only thing that speaks for itself is the obsessive urgency to sway the election results, an attempt that in the end proved to be inconsequential and unsuccesful.
0441172717|5.0|I love science Fiction, but really I only watched science fiction films.  Once I decided to through myself into the book world I researched what books to read.  Dune came up everytime as THE book to read.  So, I went out and bought it.  This book was truly an experience.  You get lost in that world and start to see things the  way they see things.  I never want to give the book away, so I will be vague.  I have to say, this is the best book I've read so far.  It had everything in it: Adventure, Action, Romance, Drama, Comedy.  If you haven't read this book then you have missed out.  And hopefully ever science fiction fan has read this, it's a classic.

0743490304|1.0|Ahhh, I didn't really like this book.  It didn't really interest me in any way.  I didn't really find the characters that cool or identifiable (b/c I don't know anyone in politics).  Anyway, I kind of just skimmed some of the book, b/c I could care less about some of the ocean biology and technology they have down there.  Just not that interesting to me, and Dan Brown's books are becoming to formulatic to me (I've read all of them).  I don't think I like this author anymore.  It's cheap thrills, and I don't get anything out of them.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD, along with his first CD, is fantastic.  Please, if you're considering getting this CD, get it.  It's great.  I'm not exactly sure what guys like \\"B.Rall\\" or \\"Maestro Mike\\" are listening to.  But it can't be this.   <br /> <br />If they knew anything about opera, they'd realize that what Josh is singing is not opera, but songs.  Romantic songs. So, do not compare him to opera singers.  He has never claimed to be an opera tenor, nor should he.  He does not sing quite as high as a tenor, but he actually has much more range.  Most tenors cannot sing as low as him, as they shouldn't have to.  Although there are some tenors that you can tell who it is when they sing(Pavarotti).  Most pretty much sound the same, at least the good ones do. Since the object of must classical music is to perform the music as close to how Verdi or Puccini or whoever originally wanted it performed, if a tenor sounds drastically different than how a tenor is \\"supposed\\" to sound, he's not performing the way he should.  Since Josh, I assume, has not been classically trained, or at least as much as the tenor \\"greats\\" have been, I'm sure he would sing opera miserably. <br /> <br />But, unlike most opera singers, Josh really sounds unique.  His voice is beautiful and very strong.  And he sings romantic songs about as well as I've ever heard.  I can tell his voice right away.   <br /> <br />In short, buy this CD.  It's unfair to compare him to opera singers or compare opera singers to him. It's unfair for both, since it's totally different.  Carreras, Pavarotti, and Domingo are great in their own right, for what they do.  As it Josh. <br /> <br />-ROB BURNS
0440234743|3.0|This was my first John Grisham book.  My parents had raved about the book, and basically shoved it into my hands.  I like John Grisham movies, so I said what the heck.  It was an enjoyable book, but it was nothing great, and really wasn't that close to greatness.  It passed the time with some entertainment, much like tv.  But, I would rate most of Tv either at a 3 or below, so there is my take on this book.
B0000640VO|5.0|Smart comedies are often relegated to the cult bin or even the bargain bin because they lack a universal quality. _Amelie_ has the ability to appeal to everyone, to transcend any language barrier (the film is in French and comes with subtitles). In the end, the film is a different kind of romantic comedy for all of those reclusive nerds out there who live in their own world and are itching to join the outside. <br /> <br />_Amelie_ features some wonderful, playful music using instruments that U.S. movie watchers may not be familiar with. The film is decidedly French, with its exaggeration of colors and tonal hue and variety of different camera lenses. <br /> <br />(On a side note, the film is likely the source for the sudden commercial use of the gnome imagery, iconography, and branding.)
0312995423|4.0|This is an enjoyable book.  But, it is really about encryption, and if you aren't even remotely interested in that, then don't come close to this book.  I took a class on encryption algorithnms in college.  So, I was already interested in what digital fortress had to offer.  I must say, Dan Brown puts a little too many plot twists and crazy acciedents for me, but it was enjoyable.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The credits and music are for starters out of this world. John Williams is at his peek(though much too close to the later theme of Indiana Jones for comfert). Even on vhs and now DVD, it`s a thrill when the opening starts.<br /><br />Superman gets the REAL treatment, it`s both serious, comic and actionfilled. This film really developes its characters. The entire cast and crew is magical; though the accident and later demise of Christopher Reeve brings sad thoughts to the mind... You really THOUGHT he was Superman, at least my generation did and still does:-)<br /><br />Every action film since owes much too much to this great movie. To my mind, only \\"The Hulk\\" 2003 and \\"Spider man 2\\"  2004 are of equal brilliance.
031286504X|1.0|This is one of only a few horror books that I have read, but I didn't think this book was good at all.  Maybe it was inventive at the time it was written, but now it doesn't strike me as very clever at all.  It is extremely boring for one thing.  It isn't exciting, it isn't scary, it's really depressing and boring.  The end is good, but even that can't make it get above a 1 star for me.  I was happy the book was over (I hate to stop reading a book in the middle).

0064409422|5.0|I must say, I hate fantasy books (Le Guin, Tolkien).  I just can't relate to the characters.  But, with this book, C.S. Lewis bring people into this world, we explore Narnia with them, and that means we can relate to the kids.  Also, the book brings us back to childhood.  I never read this book as a kid, but it brought me back to the joy of reading when I was young.  It brought back all the imagination.  I loved this book.
0316548189|5.0|(Autobiography) Since Mandela was so integral to South Africa's freedom struggle, this is a story of that struggle as much as it is a story of his life. This is a fascinating account of an amazing struggle. Mandela effectively captures the paradoxes of leadership: means versus ends, ideology versus tactics. Mandela is a remarkable man, not because he is flawless (for he shows that he is not), but because he was not afraid to fight with all his might for something he believed in.    Potentially offensive material: some violence, lots of racism
B000784WMW|5.0|The 1983 BBC adaptation of JANE EYRE is absolutely the best, in my opinion.  I often wonder, when they got it right the first time, why did the BBC keep on making newer versions?  As one who has actually read the book as well as a few biographies about Charlotte Bronte and a history of the Bronte family, I know that developing a screen play based on this huge and complex novel is not an easy undertaking. And, as one can tell by viewing the various adaptations, depending on the literary outlook, different aspects and themes are emphasized.<br /><br />In this version, undertaken in the early 1980s when Feminism was a virtue, Jane consistently emphasizes that she wishes to remain an \\"independent\\" woman. She is willing to be the helpmeet of her cousin who has been called to India to perform missionary service but does not wish to marry him. He is tall and blonde and blue-eyed and handsome, but unlike Mr. Rochester who she likens to a `Vulcan', he does not love her. More than anything else, Jane wishes to be loved, which may explain her penchant for teaching little children who love unconditionally (although truth be told, little else was available for educated women of no means in those times).  The woman's movement, underway in 19th Century England when the book was published made JANE EYRE an overnight hit, especially with \\"the lady readers\\" who sought their basic civil rights. This adaptation, emphasizing the desire for personal liberty relies on the words Jane speaks in the book.<br /><br />Produced with the technology of the times, so it was originally filmed, the transfer to DVD is excellent. Moreover, if you saw the film `Wide Sargasso Sea' ( based on a controversial book and modern novel posing as a  literary \\"forerunner\\" to JANE EYRE which introduces racism into the mix) starring Nathaniel Parker as the young Edward Rochester, you can easily believe that Timothy Dalton could have been the same man, and that the beautiful young mentally ill wife had evolved into the hideous creature hidden in the attic.<br /><br />Bronte introduced a complicated plot with many elements used by modern writers.  For example, St John's heartless proposal recalls Hiram Bingham's proposal to Jerusha Bromley in Michner's HAWAII. And, the destruction of Mr Rochester's ancestral home and the legacy of a first wife are reminiscent of conditions in REBECCA.<br /><br />The Bronte sisters were geniuses who were female victims when women could only dream of being \\"independent\\" and exercising the free will they believed God had given them and men taken away.  JANE EYRE is a timeless classic and I highly recommend this screen version.d into the hideous creature hidden in the attic. <br /> <br />Bronte introduced a complicated plot with many elements used by modern writers.

020530902X|5.0|(Style manual) I understand why William Zinsser (On Writing Well) recommends that everyone read this book once a year. Instructive and witty, it's a quick read and an excellent guide to clearer writing. Reading it through makes me think more carefully about how I write and how I speak.
B0007OCG56|4.0|This movie starts out with the college application to Princeton by a young Hispanic girl who is writing about the most influential person in her life--her mother (Paz Vega).  She relates the story of how her mother was hired to be a housekeepr by a neurotic Anglo woman (Tea Leoni)who demeaned her daughter for being overweight and who did not appreciate her long-suffering husband (Adam Sandler).  Paz's warm and accepting manner wins over both Sandler and his daughter, but does not endear her to Leoni, who spoils Vega's daughter with outings she does not have permission to take.  This movie touches on issues of race and social class, and has surprising depth.  As many of the other reviewers, I expected this to be a shallow comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking content.
B00009V7RF|1.0|This was a very bad album.  From a group who put out Joints and Jams to Fallin Up to all of there second album which was a classic to this album, man, I am dissapointed.  What happened to the we don't wear no Tommy Hilfiger?  Now there on VHI's fashion crap.  They always preached about real hip hop and not having to do gimmicks to be good, now they have that stupid girl, what ever her name is and doing wack songs with the super wack Justin Timberlake.  Do not waste your money on this, don't even waste a blank cd to burn this album.  The beats were not the soulfull production like the first two albums.  This is completely different than what they've done and it sounds as if every beat was made for the radio and not for hip hop.  I give props for the political statements on some of the songs, but man, adding that ugly chick to the mix and the beats that was put on the cd sounds as if the BEP's finally sold out.  If you want good quality hip hop done by Black Eyed Peas, check their first two albums, the second of which has Mos Def on it, but do not get this album.
B0007INZXO|5.0|Album Description <br />Coldplay's massively anticipated new album, X&Y, is the follow-up to 2002's 16-million selling A Rush of Blood To The Head and includes the single \\"Speed of Sound\\". X&Y was recorded at studios in the UK and has been produced by Danton Supple (Morrissey, Elbow), Ken Nelson (Badly Drawn Boy, Kings of Convenience) and the band themselves.  <br />Tracks include: <br /> <br />\\"Square One\\":Probable single. Built around a subtle electronic drum beat reminiscent of Brian Eno or Berlin-period Bowie, the song builds into a huge chorus featuring massive guitars and organ. Like Radiohead's \\"Paranoid Android\\", it sounds like their most ambitious and possibly best song yet. <br /> <br />\\"What If\\":Starting with a simple piano, a fragile-sounding Chris sings, \\"What if you decide/You don't want me there by your side... in your life\\". This album's \\"The Scientist\\". <br /> <br />\\"Talk\\":A possible B-side to the first single, \\"Talk\\" takes the riff from electronic music legends Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\" and builds a completely new song. It keeps the mechanical beat of the original but adds a huge guitar and dancefloor filling bass-line. Stadiums won't be big enough to contain it. <br /> <br />\\"'Til Kingdom Come\\":This was written for Johnny Cash, but he died before he could record it. Coldplay's version is a sweet Dylan-esque folk song on acoustic guitar. \\"For you I'd wait til kingdom come/Until my days, my days are done.\\" Chris vows. <br /> <br />\\"X&Y\\":The dreamy, synth-heavy song features the chorus, \\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave together/You and me are drifting into outer space.\\" Beatles-style strings suddenly appear towards the end, and the anthemic singalong \\"woo-hoo-hoo\\" outro is set to become the sound of the summer festivals. <br /> <br />\\"The Hardest Part\\":A classic Coldplay love song about loss and heartbreak, in which Chris sings, \\"The hardest part was letting go, not taking part.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0679736646|5.0|UBIK is easily my favorite P.K.D. novel, and for good reason. Excellently paced with plenty of mystery, intrigue, and dashed with Dick's trademark humor. A rollercoaster of a plot dressed in great sci-fi concepts. This is sci-fi at its best!
B000002572|5.0|I can't believe it's been almost 30 years since I (and a lot of my friends) bought this debut album by Boston, and it rocks today as much as it did then.  Back in '76, it came out on 8-track and LP - I still have the originals in both versions, although I have the original \\"Picture Album\\", one of few back then that were released for various bands. Pictures on CD's and DVD's today are common, but for those of you who have never seen a picture album, imagine the entire vinyl LP with one big picture embedded in the vinyl, normally the cover shot on a regular LP's jacket.   <br /> <br />I remember looking at another review on this album by a kid who broke out his parent's old records and found this one - hard to believe it's been that long and I'm one of the parents who originally bought it when it came out, but Boston's music and the fact that it rocks 30 years later shows that Boston will live on as one of great rock bands of our era - and I don't mean the crap they play today that's labeled as \\"rock\\". Stuff today should be put under a rock, not classified as rock.
0141439831|5.0|This is a rich, complex epic story.  As other reviewers mentioned, the main issues of the book are still relevant today.  The female characters aren't that great.  One is the stereotypical virtuous 19th century woman who is basically a doormat-she gets a bit tiresome.  The male characters were more sympathetic.  One of the best parts of the book is seeing how some characters evolve and some do not.  The book does take a while to get through, but it is worth the effort.
068484267X|5.0|In his memoir Frank McCourt tells us the story of his miserable Irish childhood without holding a thing back. The tone is the same throughout - neutral and half-conscious; it is as if a child is narrating the story, not quite understanding the situation. There is no wallowing in self-pity and exaggeration, it is the events that make the reader gasp and not the writing that could have easily been overdone with the topic. There is no fluff to the story, it is simply a story of survival.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|I, like many other bought this album because of \\"Blowers Daughter\\" hearing it in the movie \\"Closer\\"  It was such a hauntingly beautiful song I couldn't get it out of my head.  The cd is filled with equally haunting and painful tracks.  It's not a feel good piece of work.  In fact it brought back many painful memories.  Filled with love, loss and emotion this is not music for everyone and may not be something I can listen to often. It is a tremendously powerful collection of music.
B0007VZ9DK|2.0|The film itself is great; everyone will agree on that. <br />What bothers me here is the fact the film appears on an abhorable double-sided disc without a commentary. <br /> <br />First fans had to suffer through the indignity of the DVDs initial release with a lackluster transfer, zero extras, flimsy case and a price that never dropped in the nine years the film was available on DVD. Now, if the studio wants to bother with a anniversary edition please 1.) pack it to the gills with -real- extras like commentaries, documentaries and maybe some sort of retrospective... not just a couple deleted scenes and a few other forgettable thorw-away scraps on an f'n flipper. <br /> <br />But then again, who am I kidding, I'll still buy it.
B000002J09|5.0|The fourth album of the legendary band Led Zeppelin is the best of their entire discography. Greatest hits like \\"Rock And Roll\\" and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" are anthems to rock music. John Bonham is on fire here, he makes the best drumming I've ever heard. Not even Keith Moon can beat JB. Jean Paul Jones gives a good performance on his bass guitar. Let's not talk about the superb riffs of Jimmy Page because it will take a whole century to describe it. I don't know where Robert Plant got that AMAZING voice, I mean, it's just unbelievable. Well I think you can guess it from here, Led Zeppelin is my favorite rock band, along with The Who. <br />Anyways, if you're new to Led Zeppelin and you don't like collections but only albums (like me) buy this one, I swear you won't regret it, you will thank me later. <br />See ya. <br /> <br />Note: who's that bastard \\"poop\\" or something like that who says that classic music sucks? Man, do you even know what you're talking about? And believe me, today's commercial music sucks so much that it makes me want to kill myself when I hear it on the radio. Especially those wanna-be-punk like Blink or Green Day. If you wanna listen to some real punk listen to the MISFITS, DEAD KENNEDYS, BLACK FLAG, and stuff. Nu-metal? Worst music EVER.
B0000029DD|2.0|I find this guy's voice extremely unappealing. He sounds like he can't control it. Sometimes his voice sounds good, but then it goes weak. I'm amazed that so many people love it. This album is borderline pretentious and I just don't think the songs are very good. But some of the more atmospheric stuff sounds kinda cool, especially on the last song.<br /><br />P.S. - the guy's review below me is laughable.

B0000024IE|5.0|asks the question: WHEN DID YOU FIRST LOVE HIP-HOP. The answer for me was a cold summer night in 1987, at Finsbury's Park, London, waiting to hear Roy Ayres perform Live. In the interim, they were spining toons, and this one cut came on and upoar was let loose in the house. 'Rebel without a pause'was the joint.From that moment on I was hooked. Public Enemy are my favorite hip hop group of all time, and this was the last great CD,s that they released. I would recommend 'Yo Bum rush the show'(not a great CD, but you can see where they are going) it'll take a nation of Millions'(For me the most complete, best, Hip hop album OF ALL TIME)and Fear of a black planet.This album kicks off with Contract on thw World Love Jam, which is funky, and from this, directly into 'Brothers Gonna work it out, which is hyped musically, and carries a positive message for black males. Other favorites cuts are'Polly wanna cracka'(dealing with inter racial relationships) Burn Hollywood(Hollywoods abysmal record with people of colour,) Revolutionary Generation, and the brilliant Fight the power. Listening to this reminds me why I love Hip hop, and how far back the genre has gone. I feel the lack of variety in hip hop today, where by every one is either sexual, bling, or money oriented is sad.Lastly, mostly importantly. LISTEN TO THE LYRICS.I don't agree with everything they say(Love of Farakhan, and what he stands for) I believe that anyone wanting to get into this thing called Hip hop needs to include some PE in their collectiom. Essential.
0618526412|5.0|Mr. Singer had a special quality with people; a gift of compassion that he used without a word spoken. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, a fictional story by Carson McCullers, is an excellent five-star rating, taking us through one mans struggle and the many lives he encountered in a small town in the south. Even though the main character had a disability it never stopped him from becoming a mentor to four individual people. This is a well written touching story about true emotions, unfulfilled dreams, and a close companionship with a deaf mute that has a somewhat confusing and unexpected sad ending, but it can make you think about your own relationships. <br /> <br />            McCullers begins this story in a small town in Georgia. Mr. Singer and his Greek friend were two deaf mutes living together and sharing an apartment for ten years. Their relationship unfortunately, takes a turn for the worst when the Greek mute becomes very ill and destructive. Fearing the worst; the cousin of the deaf mute, whom he works for, decided to put him in a asylum against Mr. Singers pleads. The cousin did not want to become responsible for the Greeks outburst and strange behavior. Mr. Singer was heartbroken for his ten year relationship with his friend was over, but that did not stop <br /> him from visiting his Greek friend. He stayed true till the very end. Mr. Singer then  <br />became a mentor for a young girl; who loves music. A black Doctor; who struggles with <br />a strong true purpose for his race and his family. A proprietor of a bar, and a drunk by the <br />name of Jake; who reminded me of his Greek friend. <br /> <br />        Mr. Singer initial meeting with Jake was not under the best of circumstances, but <br /> Mr. Singer took him in and became his friend anyway. Jakes' behavior was so destructive, and the writer portrays him as an intelligent man. You could only expect <br />something more destructive to become of him because of his behavior. Jakes'encounter <br />with Doctor Copeland, a man who had high aspiration for the black race, and with a <br />strong true purpose, was strained and confrontational. Their relationship was confusing <br />and unexpected.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this cd a week ago. I had been told by my friends how awesome the cd is, so I purchased it. I was so excited. I love this cd. I listen to it everyday on the bus ride to school and on the bus ride home. I know all or most of the words to most of the songs already. I haven't seen the broadway show, yet but I would really like to. My friend went to NYC and saw the show and he said it was really good. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND \\"WICKED\\" TO ANYONE!!! I'm currently reading the book by Gregory Maguire and it's an incredible book. I LOVE WICKED!!
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey is unbelievable; it is amazing how much she has accomplished in her ten-year career. Technically it has been fifteen years but she has done little worth mentioning over the last five years. That's not to say her last album Charmbracelet was worthless, it did contain some memorable tracks like \\"Through the Rain\\" and \\"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy\\", but for the most part, Mariah could have done without it. It's unfortunate that \\"Glitter\\" hurt Mariah's career so tremendously because \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" proves that people were too quick to pull their allegiance out of Mariah Carey. Nothing on \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" provides the immediate gratification of her previous #1 singles, but this is undeniably her best album yet. \\"Butterfly\\" was perhaps her best until this point in that it was less formulaic than her other albums and seemed to have a genuine sense of sadness beneath it. This time, Mariah never sinks too low on her ballads but never gets too swept away with her pop songs either. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is refreshing and well-tempered. None of the production here seems trite; her ballads aren't as cloying as they once were. The Neptunes even manage to make themselves sound less familiar. \\"Say Somethin'\\" and \\"To the Floor\\" aren't beat-heavy or immediately catchy but they prove to be some of Mariah's strongest R&B cuts and they still have incredible potential at radio. This wasn't the Mariah I was hoping for in that I wanted the delight that songs like \\"Fantasy, \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Dreamlover\\", and \\"Honey\\" seem to give. But I am actually pleasantly surprised because these songs have more lasting power than any of those. \\"It's Like That\\" is the first time Mariah has really celebrated herself in the first single instead of another person and that proves that this is truly her emancipation. Those expecting \\"the return of the voice\\" may be disappointed in that the ballads here are not the kind you heard on Adult Contemporary radio back in the early nineties, these ones are all modern, up-to-date, and much less contrived. The second single \\"We Belong Together\\" has heartfelt lyrics but it also has more of an R&B flourish that keeps it from getting to be overdramatic. \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Circles\\", and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" are similar in that they aren't just run-of-the-mill ballads. Mariah owes a lot to her producers on this album and they owe a lot to her. Together they have created an album that is consistent, composed, and enjoyable all the way through while at the same time, creating something that isn't like much else on radio nowadays. Mariah's voice doesn't have the same strength it used to but she still has an incredible talent that people have to admire. Let's hope this emancipation revives her career and gets the credit it deserves.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I saw them in Indianapolis at the Murate Center and they sounded so good live it was awseom! The energy in the room was wild I had a great time! I went with my brother but made friends fast and we partied and danced. Cute girls were dressed up pretty cool too and we all had lots of fun. I bought the album and I loved every song! Thanks for such a great time and great music Strokes!
B0007GAERG|5.0|You know, I've been a fan of Ms. Carey from day one.  I remember the day and minute I heard Vision of Love on the radio, and I've been enchanted ever since, even during the not so good CDs.  I must admit this CD had to grow on me, but I find myself obsessed with different songs each time I listen to the CD.  It started with Say Somethin' (a nice summertime mellow groove with a good bounce).  Then it was We Belong Together (a nice ballad with a good climax).  The next time I heard the CD I became fixated on Your Girl (unbelievable chorus).  Tonight while driving home from the club I fell for Joy Ride (another mellow groove).  Mariah definitely returned to her former vocal style, a la Daydream.  In fact, I haven't enjoyed an MC CD this much since Daydream.  If you're relatively new to MC's world, try listening to a few of her classic songs: Forever, Anytime You Need a Friend, So Blessed, Dreamlover, Without You, Open Arms, Fantasy, Vanishing, Till the End of Time, and my ALL time favorite, All I've Ever Wanted.  You only have to listen to the way Kelly Clarkson and Christina Aguilera turn a phrase to realize MC's impact on music over the past 15 years.  The Emancipation of Mimi just proves once again, that my girl can SING, and that's why we love her.
B000286RKW|5.0|\\"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.\\" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.     Based on the real life story of Henry Hill, Goodfellas depicts two Irish-Italian Americans, Henry Hill (Liota) and Jimmy Conway (De Niro), and their full-blooded Italian friend Tommy DeVito (Peschi) rise in the mafia. Goodfellas progresses into the day-to-day life of three members of the Mafia as they try to rise up the ranks. The story revolves around Henry and his personal struggles from petty crime, to hired killer, to drug dealer.     Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Casino, Cape Fear, Raging Bull) delivers in Goodfellas, perhaps his best movie. Scorsese does a wonderful job of allowing the music to set the mood. As the viewer, you may not notice it, but Scorsese's music sets the tone for the rise and fall of the emotion throughout his films. Scorsese depicts very dark images well. The viewer feels the villain in each character. There is no good guy in Goodfellas and Scorsese makes you feel it.     Scorsese adds little pieces to the movie that are not necessary, but really add to the film. Some examples of these occurrences are when Hill gets beat by his Dad for not attending school. The local mob drives around, finds the postman, then roughs him up for delivering mail from the school to Hill's house. Another prime example occurs with the guy who continues to irritate De Niro with the line, \\"I want my money.\\" This guy is a smuck, all movie you are waiting for him to get whacked, you just know it is coming. Then, you think he might make it, nope.     Joe Pesci, and his little man complex are wonderful once again. Lethal Weapon 2 was his launching point in my opinion. However, Goodfellas depicted him as the little guy with the big attitude you did not want to mess with. This little man complex he developed and depicted to perfection in Goodfellas definitely helped him later grab the roles in Casino, Home Alone 1 & 2, My Cousin Vinny, and A Bronx Tale. Pesci really had a coming out party in Goodfellas, and it was wonderful to watch unfold.     Samuel L. Jackson even had his bit part. The poor guy did not last very long, too bad, because he just made it big. Then he got his for not doing what De Niro told him.     Overall Goodfellas is a must have in your DVD collection, one of the great mob movies of all time. I know a lot of people on Amazon want to place it ahead of Scarface...but I cannot. Scarface is brilliant from beginning to end, while Hill punks out at the end. If Hill went out like a man, similar to Scarface, the two films would be tied. Unfortunately, Hill turned into a waste of life, as Tony Montana was on his way to becoming. I must say for that reason alone, Goodfellas is the second greatest Mob movie of all time.     Grade: A     (...)
B00005JKC3|4.0|I wish I had a dollar for every reference to the TV show, dare I write an article on this film, here.<br /><br />Maybe Hulk is not be the best movie ever made, but what it did is something not many people know how to accept.  I have never seen people's opinions so varied!  (One person told me it was \\"too artistic\\"!)  I recommend reading Roger Ebert's review on his webpage, because he gets it right.  The film is about \\"children of egomaniacal parents\\", and this is what characters Banner and his girlfriend have in common.  It is not so hard to connect one's self with the characters in this film, except that they, too, (as people with individualistic traits) were misunderstood in their childhood.<br /><br />I credit Ang Lee for the art, research, and development of this film.  His pet-project uncannily identifies the Hulk as a modernized classic horror and monster genre tale, and he made it a thing of beauty.  I felt remorse over Banner and his girlfriend for \\"the curse of the Hulk\\".  (I use quotes because it could've been named \\"the Curse Of the Hulk\\".)  This movie was as graphic as Beauty And the Beast, the Phantom Of the Opera, Frankenstein's creation and the Bride, Night Of the Demon, King Kong, Curse Of the Werewolf, Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde, or particularly Forbidden Planet's CREATURE OF THE ID.<br /><br />The first scene of Banner turning into the Hulk scared hell into me.  The Hulk wrecked a laboratory like an angry rhino in a china shop, and people would run from the Hulk the way bystanders ran for their lives from a collapsing NYC scyscraper, with another teetering.  I liked the animation of the Hulk, who, in this film, characterizes 5000 pounds of rage.  The metaphor of anger and how it's used is the basis for the Hulk character.  One horrificly fascinating scene is set in a steamy bathroom where Banner peers into the sink mirror and a reflection of the Hulk pulls him through it, and the two fall into a chasm.  These scenes are very adult and obviously more connected to the subconscious rather than reality.<br /><br />The visual technique of the film, with all its artistry and montage sequences, makes quite a cinematic presentation.  (Additionally, Elfman puts in a great score with his signature of electronic instruments.)  Experiencing the movie from the DVD using the DTS track, or from a High Def D-VHS with a large, plasma tv presentation in a dark room gives Hulk extra fright.s rather than reality.

B00005JNVS|4.0|I watched more than a week of commercials for \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" on such TV venues as TBS, and figured I'd go, since I can always use a good laugh and don't mind some action as well.  But then I get there, find the whole thing is in Chinese, and with a story I couldn't follow.  I suppose there was humor I could pick up on, but it was far from side-splitting.  I suspect that this was a case of pearls before swine, for I'm guessing that a lot of fine martial arts film values were present but I couldn't appreciate them.  My own experience would rate 3.7 stars.  I'm sorry.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I made the mistake of listening to the cast album several times before seeing this movie, and consequently I hated it the first time I saw it through.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />I forced myself to go back and rewatch it a few times, mainly because I found the visuals above all else, enthralling. Lo and behold, as my mind slowly let go of my iron-wrought image of Michael Crawford as the Phantom, Gerard Butler's mark made itself known. While certainly not the vocal alumni that Crawford is, Butler has an amazingly powerful voice that had many noteworthy performances throughout the film if one can simply let go of the stage production. Aside from his singing, Butler was an extraordinary visual actor, allowing for inner turmoil to be displayed through close-ups and facial acting simply not possible in a stage production. I found his ability to convey his emotions through his face far more appealing than his actual looks (which are, mind you, good). He is not without his flaws, however, probably the more glaring of which is apparent in the final confrontation between himself and Raoul, where he is so focused on being intense, he forgets to sing so much as scream. It made my head hurt. However, he was absolutely beautiful in this role and now holds as much love in my heart as Crawford.<br /><br />Emma Rossum I still have mixed feelings about. Actually, compared to Sarah Brightman, their good points and flaws are just about opposite of each other. With Brightman, I was pleased by her perfect singing voice, yet later on in the cast album, it starts to run emotionally flat and sounds a little more robotic. Rossum's voice is somewhat immature as a \\"professional\\" singer. Many of her higher notes become unclear and a bit nasally, but there's a unique tone to the notes that she can perform, a vocal effect unique to her voice that somewhat difficult to explain in writing. However, one thing is certain is that it is indeed a very pretty voice, and easy to appreciate. I actually came to enjoy her performances of \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" and \\"The Point of No Return\\" more than Brightman's, in many respects. Along with Butler, she is also a very strong visual actor, able to act along with her singing in a believable way.<br /><br />My thoughts of Patrick Wilson are probably somewhat biased to my general dislike of Raoul's character, but while his singing voice was solid, moreso than the main characters', it was bland and unappealing, lacking any sort of luster or emotional connection to his feelings for Christine. The same goes for his overall acting. But then again, as I said...I'm not fond of Raoul to begin with.<br /><br />Minnie Driver made me like Carlotta. Her performance was absolutely fall-out-of-your chair hysterical. The same goes to the men whose names I cannot recall who play Andre and Firmin. Kudos points definitely go to the comedic appeal added to the movie version.<br /><br />As for the movie itself...There's a lot to both love and hate.<br /><br />Love points go to: The addition of scenes such as the epilogue (no spoilers). The Phantom crushing the rose he gave to Christine (I cried like a baby). The costume and set design; I was absolutely floored by the visual appeal this movie has, especially the Masquerade number and the design for both the Phantom's mask and his deformed face...to which they found a comfortable middle of shocking without disgusting their audience. Additional love points go to the chemistry between Rossum and Butler who pulled off their roles beautifully and gracefully and gave me a whole new set of visual playbacks to draw on when listening to either the cast or movie album.<br /><br />Hate points go to: Minor lyrical changes that just weren't as good as the original, too small to even bother pointing out. If you have the script memorized as much as I do, you'll know what I mean. Frustrating as well was the decision to speak parts of what were originally sung. It worked well in one scene.Not so with the others. Probablly the most horrific of which was Christine talking about her engagement to Raoul, and again when she's expressing her unwillingness to perform in the Phantom's opera. For all the awkwardness of it, they might just have easily written new dialogue and annoyed me less. Rhyming just does not work well in spoken acting. Probably my biggest beef with this movie has to do with the graveyard confrontation between the Phantom and Raoul. The swordfight...I don't mind the swordfight being added, I really don't. It was actually really fun to watch, and Butler was a VERY aggressive swordsman which made it all that much more appealing. (SPOLIER ALERT)No, my biggest problem is that he LOST. The whole point (or at least one major point) of the entire production is that Raoul CANNOT beat the Phantom in wits or strength. Gone are the smartass remarks of the Phantom urging Raoul to his death, no instead we get Christine saying \\"No Raoul, not like this...\\" I mean, really...how clich&eacute; is that? Even more than clich&eacute;, how different is it to beat the Phantom in a sword duel than shoot him in the back during his own opera?! It just doesn't add up for me. (/SPOLIER ALERT) My other major gripe was the visual directing of the final confrontation in the Phantom's lair. The lasso-ing of Raoul and the smashing of mirrors could have been ALOT more visually appealing in the hands of someone else's directing. I felt that visual themes were wasted here; they could have been alot more emotionally provoking.<br /><br />Overall, once I made myself go back and watch this movie again, I loved it, in spite of its somewhat annoying flaws. The good points definitely outweigh the bad; the main thing to remember is not to hold it again the stage production. Both versions have their merits in my eyes now, and I enjoy each just as much, as, I think, any fan of the musical should. For those of you who don't like Andrew Llyod Webber's work: this movie will not changeyour minds. But for many people like myself who can love productions in spite of imperfection, this movie will definitely leave a large mark on your heart.
B000002UAO|5.0|I rarely will write in any of my reviews that a particular album is essential listening. I have a very eclectic taste in music. There are few albums I truly believe that everyone who loves music should own, one of those albums is The Beatles \\"Rubber Soul\\" album (the other is \\"Revolver\\"). I am not a big fan of The Beatles music by a long shot however I cannot deny that the legendary British band put out some of the catchiest pop/rock songs known to mankind and that they helped shape rock and roll music to what it is today (some of it good, and some of it atrocious). My all time favorite song by The Beatles is \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\". I absolutely love the melodies. I'm not really fond of \\"Drive My Car\\". The gruff vocals from Lennon and McCartney wasn't really easy listening for my ears. After listening to the band's earlier songs from the compilation \\"1\\", it is amazing how much the band's sound evolved from that infectious pop songs to the more mature songs like \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Think For Yourself\\". The music has an edgier sound, almost psychedelic which is quite a stretch from the goofy pop ditties \\"I Just Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week\\" (good songs though). I just started listening to this cd in a couple of years and I am just in awe of just how well \\"Rubber Soul\\" has managed to still hold up well when music is flooded with bands that won't be remembered in five years. I can never tire listening to \\"Rubber Soul\\". Just give me The Beatles, I'll pass on bands like The Strokes and Jet.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys once again give listeners something enchanting to listen to... It may be basically her same, traditional R&B sound, but she has indeed matured as a vocalist and comes forth with classy, outstanding style on this album.      The radio superhit \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is here, and a true highlight among the 15 song set; Her strong vocals give the ladies a new anthem with the infectious \\"Karma\\"; She sings with genuine emotion about love's ups and downs in the soulful \\"Samsonite Man\\" and \\"When You Really Love Someone\\".  The sweet, free-flowing title track is easily my favorite of all the songs.  Kanye West's hypnotizying \\"So Simple\\" is another great.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes remarkable singing and good R&B music.
0440237688|5.0|I am not the kind of person who reads one book more than once in a short period of time but the Giver  was an exception. The first time I read it I couldn't put it down. I read through math class, through dinner, after my parents told me to turn my light off I read it with a flashlight under my covers until I was done. For the next month I couldn't get it out of my head (the first sign of a good book) so I picked it up again. I read for what seemed like barely minutes but must have been hours because by the time I stopped I was more than half way through. I seriously got lost in the Giver and I have a feeling I will need to read it quite a few more times before the year is over.     This book is about a perfect era. There is no pain. There is no fear. There is no sorrow. But there is also no love, no color, no music, no snow, no pure joy. Everything is planned and calculated so there are no choices. There are rules for everything. When you get too old, break the rules three times, or are simply a baby that won't develop fast enough, you are released, sent Elsewhere. But Elsewhere isn't what the people are led to believe. Children don't live with the people who gave birth to them but with a 'family unit,' two people who applied for spouses; babies. There is only one person who remembers what used to be, who remembers love, color, music, choice. He is the Reciever of Memory. The Giver.     I guess I don't really have much original to say about this book that hasn't been analysed and discussed thouroughly already, but just imagine if that is our future, total sameness. No individuality, no pride, simply sameness. If that is what we are to become, than what is the true cost of pain? It's true that war must end and that starvation is torturous, but I think we can fix these things without getting rid of love.     I think everyone should read this book. It is a bit disturbing and it makes you think, but it is not jut your ordinary fluffly little kid's book. Some people commented that because it was about a perfect place it wasn't exciting or scary. But it was the perfectness that scared me. Now I know that perfection has a cost. And that even that whicg appeears perfect could be, in fact, sheilding the lies.
B0006284JQ|4.0|This album is perfect for Britney Spears because it compiles the BEST of her last 4 albums into one, greatest hits compilation that doesn't quit.  It also brings to mind the truthfully wonderful element of her success -- bona fide enchanting dance-pop music accented by a sexy, young vocal.  The new tracks aren't anything to shout about, but the scope of the album is her past success and career triumphs, so the album is probably her best in terms of the music. <br /> <br />Highlights for me include \\"Stronger\\", \\"Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Me Against the Music\\", but most pop fans will find a handful of enjoyable tracks.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Two words: \\"Telegraph Road,\\" which is quite simply one of the most beautiful, somehow simultaneously heartbreaking and uplifting songs ever written.  14+ minutes is not too long, and you owe it to yourself to hear it in its entirety.  (The crimes committed against it within the \\"live remix\\" on the _Money for Nothing_ compilation aren't quite as bad as those committed against that album's title track, but they're still pretty bad.)<br /><br />It's got to be between this and _Making Movies_ for the title of Best Dire Straits Album.  _MM_ has a few more songs, which is a definite positive.  Then again...have I mentioned, \\"Telegraph Road\\"?
B00006879E|5.0|From the moment I heard \\"This Love\\", I knew Maroon 5 was a great band.  I don't know if it was the captivating lead vocals of Adam Levine, or the funky, driving bass line of the track.  More fascinating is the entire album, Songs About Jane.  True, Maroon 5 has deep, real lyrics full of emotional substance and intent, but the one thing that stands out on this album is the mix of soul, R&B, and good 'ol rock and roll.    Maroon 5 possess the soulful vocals, harmonies and hooks that make R&B songs chart-toppers; the crying, seductive guitar lines and steady, powerful percussion of rock music; and that grooving bass of classic funk and soul.  That not only makes them an effectively eclectic band, but also deems them capable of COMBINING all these much loved styles together.  Songs like the breathless \\"She Will Be Loved\\" elude a dramatic, rock love ballad, while others like the upbeat, swingy, bassy \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Through With You\\" possess R&B-like vocals that sweeten up a hard-driving percussion line.  A lot of the songs border on Matchbox 20 and Train in their post-relationship content and falsetto, yet gentle lead vocals (...respectively, needless to say...), like \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Tangled\\", but unlike those attention-aging bands, Maroon 5 excels at joining R&B, funk, pop, soul, and rock in meaningful, addictive songs, which evidently is in demand in the new millenium.  And their candid, unplanned, non-traditional style?? -- that's the essence of the new millenium, for those that haven't realized it!
B0000028VT|5.0|Music Box is my favorite Mariah Carey album. It holds sentimental value to me because it was my first MC CD. Every song is top notch. Here's my quick review of all the tracks: <br /> <br />DREAMLOVER: Very fun, cute song. It's been around for over ten years now and I still love it as much now as I did back then.  <br /> <br />HERO: This is probably my favorite Mariah song ever. It's the song that made me a fan of hers. It has a great message. You've all heard it of course, so you know how meaningful the lyrics are and how beautiful the music is. My favorite part is \\"The Lord knows dreams are hard to follow, but don't let anyone tear them away. Hold on, there will be tomorrow, in time you'll find the way.\\" <br /> <br />ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND: Love this song. The chorus gives it that extra quick. I like to listen to this song when I'm feeling sad, it makes me feel a little bit better. <br /> <br />MUSIC BOX: Appropriately, this song really does sound like a music box. Absolutely beautiful and soothing. It very much like a lullaby. My mom once joked that she wouldn't be able to listen to this song driving because she'd probably drift off. I think this is one of Mariah's underrated songs. <br /> <br />NOW THAT I KNOW: Very fast paced song. You may have dozed off a little listening to the previous song, but this one will definitely wake you up! Great, fun song. <br /> <br />NEVER FORGET YOU: Very nice, lovely ballad.  <br /> <br />WITHOUT YOU: Wonderful cover. I've just always loved this song and the way she sings it. <br /> <br />JUST TO HOLD YOU ONCE AGAIN: I have to admit the honest truth. I really didn't like this song the at first. I thought it was too slow and too boring. But now, I've learned to appreciate it more and I just love it. It's a beautiful ballad. It starts off soft, but gets louder at the end of the song. <br /> <br />I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU: If I had to pick my least favorite track off this album, this one would probably be it, but it's stilla pretty great song. There really are no bad songs! Fun, fast paced song. <br /> <br />ALL I'VE EVER WANTED: Like \\"Music Box,\\" this is another calm, soothing ballad. It's a beautiful finish for this CD. My favorite line is \\"If you were my own to caress and hold, I would shower you with love and drown within your soul.\\" <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is the funniest movie since Spinal Tap.  The people on here who give it one star reveal their Paris Hilton level low IQ's.  You will especially love this film if you grew up in rural America- very real and very hysterical.  It is so brilliant that Haylie Duff is in it, ridiculed as a typical rural barely pretty chick with an attitude, and she doesn't even know it.  This is a film that you will end up watching over and over again much like Spinal Tap or even Shawshank Redemption.
B000002LAC|5.0|This memorable collaboration remains a masterpiece of heavenly harmonies on some timeless songs by Parton, Phil Spector, Jimmie Rodgers, Linda Thompson and Kate McGarrigle plus traditional country classics. There is also plenty of stylistic variety, from the uptempo country wailer The Pain Of Loving You, through the lilting ballad Making Plans to the elegant interpretation of the Spector classic To Know Him Is To Love Him.<br /><br />The three songbirds take turns with the main vocals, e.g. the authentic piece of Americana, Hobo's Meditation with Linda on lead is followed by the breezy song Wildflowers with Dolly taking lead, but of course the most impressive sound is where they all sing together.<br /><br />One of my favorites on an album of consistent listening pleasure is the fragile and soulful My Dear Companion. The rhythmic Rosewood Casket with its lovely nostalgic imagery follows the tender and melancholy I've Had Enough. The album closes with the gripping spiritual Farther Along, an achingly beautiful and uplifting song.<br /><br />The song selection is superb and the singing is a triumph as the strengths of the three singers' voices are brought to the fore in all the right places and they blend perfectly. I am primarily an Emmylou fan, but every one of the trio deserves equal credit on this one. Western Wall is another great harmony album, with just Emmylou and Linda Ronstadt but the sound is more folk than country. Trio is highly recommend to fans of all three artists, and provides a great listening experience.

B0007KTAU4|5.0|All the reviews above are great... I just wanted to add that not only Carla Bruni is an Italian supermodel, a singer/song writer but also a great actress in French movies!! Think 'L'apartement' and many more since...
B000002AHC|5.0|This album is the most far-reaching effort by the Byrds and packs a powerful punch.  The group seems to be struggling with the excesses of the times and perhaps of the \\"artificial\\" energy spoken of in the title cut, but to a sublimely creative peak.  I love all of the Byrds albums, but this one really astounds with one great track after another.  I can't see how there could be much of an argument that this collection of songs is some of the best of the era.  And by the way, the remastering job is very good with a great selection of additional tracks (Moog Raga, Bound to fall, Triad & Universal Mind Decoder are welcome additions and alternate versions of Goin' Back & Draft Morning are fine since I love both of those songs).  There is even a secret extended track of the band arguing through rehearsals which is quite funny.  If you don't know this album and are just nosing around, trust me that this is one of the most classic psychedelic albums and worth twice the price.  This is a desert Island pick for me.  My vote for the greatest hippie song - the free love \\"Triad\\" by Crosby that got cut from the original album and was lent out to Jefferson Airplane on Crown of Creation and later on the first CSN album.  The song itself, and this version particularly just soars as a melodic and harmonic masterpiece with the great guitar and winking lilt of Crosby's voice, and the subject matter........someday maybe others!  Draft Morning could bring a tear to any caring vet's eye, what a powerful song (sad for me too, a family member just went off to the army...strong reminder of the Vietnam fiasco)!  The Byrds are hitting on all cylinders here and the emotional impact is heavy.  An essential, get it if you don't have it in this remaster, it is well worth it.  (Dolphins do SMILE, and you will too!)  Funny it appears to be the cheapest price of the Byrds albums???  Peace!!
0670033375|5.0|COLLAPSE: HOW SOCIETIES CHOOSE TO FAIL OR SUCCEED by Jared Diamond was a fascinating book. It has history, anthropology, conservation and the mother-ship of organizational communication issues: What societies do/decide that makes the difference for<br /><br />them in their ultimate success or failure. Also, as I was reading, I would think, \\"I LOVE this book. I learn five things on every page!\\" (I learned what a palynologist was, how Australia's old soils make farming difficult, and how the Greenland Norse died out in large part because they wouldn't eat fish.)<br /><br />Diamond writes in the opening that the book's structure may be pictured as a boa constrictor that has swallowed two large animals and several small ones. The two large sections of the book deal with Modern Montana and the Greenland Norse (four chapters: \\"The Viking Prelude and Fugues,\\" \\"Norse Greenland's Flowering,\\" \\"Norse Greenland's End\\" and \\"Opposite Paths to Success\\"). The shorter sections deal with the past societies of Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the Anasazi and their neighbors and the Mayans and the modern societies of Rwanda, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, China and Australia. The final section of the book is titled \\"Practical Lessons,\\" and in it, Diamond analyzes why societies make the decisions they do, how big business and the environment interact and what it all means to us today.<br /><br />Though not rigid in his structure, Diamond analyzes each scenario by examining five categories of influences on the outcome of that society. Those categories are environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and friendly trade partners and the society's response to its environmental problems.<br /><br />Some have found fault with Diamond's means of analyzing these issues and his conclusions are very powerful, but flawed because he looks at island nations predominantly (whose environmental<br /><br />issues may be different, more rigid, etc.) and that these \\"under current conditions\\" hypotheses rarely hold up because people correct themselves to avert the dire outcomes that may come if those trends continue unabated.<br /><br />But having read COLLAPSE, I disagree with that criticism of the book. First, I think that while not all of the lessons Diamond extrapolates  from the examples he outlines here are applicable to each society and community on earth, general ideas are instructive in terms of how we make our choices and what we may be fooling ourselves about regarding our futures and our own culture's security. Also, Diamond's contribution to the \\"marketplace of ideas\\" along with the concerns of others and the innovations that answer those concerns are actually what avert the direst of outcomes from happening in the end.<br /><br />GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, Diamond's preceding book in this vein, is essentially the first section of Diamond's method of \\"explaining<br /><br />it all.\\" Diamond won the Pulitzer for that book. He is a professor of geography at the University of California. He actually began is scientific career in physiology and has \\"expanded into evolutionary biology and biogeography.\\"<br /><br />I found particularly interesting the modern society chapters on Rwanda and the Dominican Republic and Haiti, but I learned an incredible amount of history, politics and anthropology along with environmental and ecological information on every page, in every section. I was never bored (plus there are maps! maps!!), and it changed the lens through which I view the world and our place in it.<br /><br />I unequivocally recommend this book.t conditions\\" hypotheses rarely hold up because people correct themselves to avert the dire outcomes that may come if those trends continue unabated. <br /> <br /> <br />But having read COLLAPSE, I disagree with that criticism of the book.

B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran is an 80's Essential.......now that we live in a world dominated by crappy rap and bland nu-metal and don't forget those horrible scremo poseur punk bands like \\"Good Charlotte\\"........anyways Duran Duran is pop and when i say POP i dont mean GAY MICHAEL JACKSON LITTLE BOY POP A BONER MAN.........i mean smooth flowing songs......although all the songs are dated i find pleasure in listening to them although there are some songs that i can take seriously still such as Come Undone and even A View To A Kill some songs are cheesy but then remember it was the 80's............its really worth the money good stuff...........drop brittany spears Justin Timberlake and pick up some Duran Duran
B000092ZYX|4.0|I can understand the mixed reviews this album has gotten... I have similar mixed feelings myself with the band in general.  I LOVE material off The Bends & OK Computer, but the 2 in between did nothing for me.  Even a diehard fan friend of mine was quite disappointed with Amnesiac... I can still picture the expression of disappointment on his face when we 1st heard it.  In the back of my head, I was hoping that the next release would be better, & after seeing the video to \\"There There\\" on MTV, I was very relieved.  But I wasn't gonna jump on the bandwagon just cuz one song was good.  I then had watched a performance they did on MTV or MTV2 at the time, & liked the other material... but didn't hear the rest of it until a year or 2 later.  So yes, this does have to take time to grow on you.  I also have to be in the mood to listen to this all the way, but when I am, it sounds pretty amazing.<br /><br />1. 2+2=5 - I wouldn't say this makes the greatest opener, but it does give a good impression with what to expect the rest of the album would sound like.<br /><br />2. Sit Down, Stand Up - pretty good.... the repetiion of \\"raindrops\\" kinda gets to me though<br /><br />3. Sail to the Moon - yah, I immediately thought of some Pink Floyd references at first, but I don't mind... one of my favorite slower songs on here.<br /><br />4. Backdrifts - I really dig the electronic sounds in this one<br /><br />5. Go to Sleep - ahhh, more classic sounding Radiohead to me with acoustic guitar & more of a general rock feel<br /><br />6. Where You & I Begin - I LOVE this one! probably my favorite song on the whole album, thanks to the moving bass line & wavering synth line... one of the ones that makes me wanna listen over & over.<br /><br />7. We Suck Young Blood - with a title like that, you'd expect it to be on the soundtrack of a vampire movie... & it seems to do just that to me, esp. w/ the wavering bass line & interesting chord changes.<br /><br />8. The Gloaming - more electronic... not my favorite, but good<br /><br />9. There There - The song itself is really good... the video is very very cool... you must see it if you haven't already.<br /><br />10. I Will - good slow track<br /><br />11. Punch Up at a Wedding - doesn't quite sound like other songs on here, but that's not a bad thing<br /><br />12. Myxamatosis - one of the heavier songs on here... I like it a lot with the fuzz guitars<br /><br />13. Scatterbrain - slower again, but at least still with regular guitars & drums... the kind of song where you just do nothing but sit & listen<br /><br />14. A Wolf at the Door - nice slow almost waltzey closure/>9. There There - The song itself is really good... the video is very very cool... you must see it if you haven't already. <br />10.

6305075492|5.0|There's not much to say about THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI that hasn't already been said, in depth and available at your local bookstore.  An internet search will yield a rich harvest of scholarly discussion on this film, as well.<br /><br /> CABINET demands a bit of adjustment from its 21st century audience.  We don't make silent movies much anymore, nor do we wrap Conrad Veidt in leotards and black eye makeup, tell him to creep about the sets like Baryshnikov, call him the Sonambulist and hail him as the first horror creature in cinematic history (or one of the first, anyway).  We don't dress our sets in wild and weird angles, have characters walk through rhomboid doors and peer through windows that seem to have started as square before lying on their sides and taking a nap.  If time has robbed CABINET of its ability to horrify, it has fully retained its ability to creep out.  The cumulative effect of watching this movie is a definite feeling of unease, of a sane world violated and displaced.<br /><br />Beyond its place in cinematic history (it sits at the first table) and artistic merit, CABINET remains an eminently watchable movie.  Of course it's silent, the sets are outrageous and the acting is highly stylized, but it all works to a rewarding end.  I watched this one twice in the span of three days - once without and the next time with the commentary track, and I will probably put it into the rotation of movies that I watch again simply for the pleasure of it.  The print is in good to very good condition and the commentary by film scholar Mike Budd is scholarly and interesting.
B000669GAI|5.0|As a 20 something starting to look back on the proverbial 'days of my youth', I've recently (within the past few years) started listening to all the bands that I grew up with.  It also doesn't hurt that I've had to learn many of these songs for various bands I play guitar for.  Many of these bands have broken up, and I already own their whole catalogues.  Others, like Pearl Jam, have remained active and have recorded a slew of songs in the time since I last listened to them on any regular basis.  Seeking a way to reintroduce myself to the band, especially the material from the period after Vitalogy, I decided to give rearviewmirror a try. <br />This compilation seems to do a good job of providing a cross sampling of the music Pearl Jam has recorded throughout their carreer.  The format is also quite innovative and pleasing.  Eschewing the usual trend of chronological order for the tracks on a 'best of' cd, rearviewmirror gives the listener an 'up disc' and a 'down disc'.  The up disc contains Pearl Jam's more rockin' songs, while the down disc contains the ballads and other slower tempo sings.   <br />All in all, rearviewmirror is a great way for an old fan to get reintroduced to an old friend, or for anyone not familiar with Pearl Jam (a travesty in my opinion) to get to know them.  Even fans who already own these songs may enjoy the compilation for its splitting of songs into \\"up\\" and \\"down\\".  The remixed versions of PJ standards Once, Alive, and Black are also amazing.  These remixes provide great separation of the instruments, and a very up-front sound with a lot of dynamics.  The price is very reasonable as well (less than 20$ for 2 cd's).
B0001I561E|5.0|One of disney's best Animated movies is Aladdin. Robin Willams adds alot of humor for adults which makes this a perfect family film.The Soundtrack is also one of the best at disney.It includes the song 'A whole new world'. On the bonus disk there are minigames, deleated scenes, and the making of special. Although some of the bonus material is not adequet you get your bang for your buck.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|If you enjoy plot holes, a killer with a seemingly endless suppy of time and money to spend on torture devices and surveillance equipment and a plot twist at the end where it is discovered that the identity of the killer was not some well thought-out clever surprise, but rather some guy just pulled out of the writer's buttocks - then this is the movie for you.
B00005JMAH|2.0|There were several things very wrong and left out of the movie that I felt were crucial to the overall plot Just a few things are: <br /> <br />-They never explained that Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were Lupin, Petigrew, Sirius, and James <br /> <br />-They left out the Quidditch Cup <br /> <br />-They never explained about Lupin's werewolf potion. Hermoine says \\"Professor Lupin didn't take his potion tonight!!\\" or something along those lines. People who haden't read the books would be confused. <br /> <br />Instead of including these plot points, they wasted their time on \\"artsy\\" shots, shrunken heads, and bad acting. Not to mention the screenwriter probably had never even read the books. Don't waste your money on this movie... It's not worth it.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" is an excellent movie. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, an African-born U.N. interpreter who overhears a conversation about a plot to assassinate the dictator of Matobo. Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is then assigned to protect Silvia and crack the case.<br /><br />This is a great suspense thriller with an interesting and witty plot. It's also a psychological drama of sorts: Tobin and Silvia are both coping with personal losses while trying to deal with the stressful situation at hand. Kidman and Penn are both amazing Oscar-winning actors, and they turn in amazing performances in this film.<br /><br />My favorite thing about \\"The Interpreter\\" is that it is the only feature film that has ever been shot on location inside the United Nations. It was great to see the details of these famous and somewhat intimidating government buildings and watch this exciting story unfold. (There are also some really great scenes shot in the streets of New York as well.)<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me about this movie was the ending. Silvia kind of flips out at the end of the film, and although she definitely has clear motivation for what she does, I had a hard time buying into the fact that she wigged out to such an extreme, and also that her little speech to the dictator appeared to have such a profound effect on him. The story wraps up pretty nicely at the end, though, so that one little inconsistency can easily be forgiven.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller: good movies are hard to find these days, and \\"The Interpreter\\" is definitely one you don't want to miss.
0486266885|3.0|While many extol the supposed virtues of this novella as either a great gothic story, or insightful social commentary, I found neither. Rather, it is a tale of Dr Jekyll, a man who invents a potion that allows him to transform himself into a more assertive, albeit fiendish being (Mr. Hyde) for a small period of time where his original personality is suppressed. These periods grow longer as Jekyll loses control etc. etc. It's not a bad concept but I found it not to be much more deep than that - it seemed kind of on the same level as spin-off versions of the concept, like the film \\"The Mask\\". <br /> <br />This had the potential to be a much more punchy, psychological story but psychology is not Stevenon's special trademark. The result is simply a good (not great) and not particularly memorable novella - at least it wasn't memorable for me.
B00070DK5K|5.0|1974. Bowie had just finished his brillant \\"Diamond Dogs\\" album. He was coked out of his mind almost daily. Then, decides to do a world tour. Somehow it worked. <br /> <br />This album, recorded from live shows at Philly's Tower Theater, is completely underrated. Brillant musicians (Mike Garson, Herbie Flowers, Earl Slick, David Sanborn), soon-to-be famous backup singers (Luther Vandross) and of course, Bowie.  <br /> <br />The songs are great versions of the then new \\"Diamond Dogs\\" material, some R&B covers, Bowie singing \\"On Broadway\\" at the end of \\"Aladdin Sane\\" plus jazzy recreations of Bowie's classics. This album has plenty of sax but don't let that scare you. The band still plays hard which works great as a comparison to the jazz pianos and saxes. <br /> <br />Bowie, as I said, was lost in a white powdered daze at the time. As Bowie himself said about the album, \\"it should be called David is Live but only in theory.\\" He was about 100 pounds at the time and pale as anything but somehow his voice still sounds great. Not as good as it could be but still very powerful. His voice, at his worst, he's still one of the best singers out there.  <br /> <br />To put it best, if you're a hardcore Bowie fan you'll love it. If you're just a casual fan, you still want to check this out.  <br /> <br />P.S. I resent the review on CDNOW saying that \\"By the mid-80's Bowie's \\"Changes\\" came to an ironic dead end.\\" Alright, I'll admit his mid-80's stuff wasn't the best but his career DOES NOT end there. And his \\"Changes\\" (a very old and tired cliche pun when talking about Bowie) don't end there. Check out Tin Machine, his 90's experiments or his back to basics rock stuff from this decade.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is a nearly unclassifiable film.  You could call it noir occult with more than a dash of science fiction and wry social commentary thrown in for leavening.  I tend to thing of it as a Gnostic restatement of 'Back to the Future.'  But the truth is that it is in its own little world of creativity and spookiness.  What director Richard Kelly has done is taken the story of a mildly psychotic teenager caught in someone else's cycle of guilt and expiation and turned it into something that deserves cult film status if nothing else.<br /><br />Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is our semi-psychotic hero.  His insanity sets him apart in the religious sense, making him liable to insights and visions which are crazy by our standards, but pierce one of reality's veils in an almost prophetic way.  When a jet motor comes out of nowhere to crash on his bedroom, from which he has been lured by an evil rabbit time becomes the crisis of Donnie's existence.  Mumbling old women whisper to him and a teacher passes him a secret text in a darkened classroom.  The book 'The Philosophy of Time' is Donnie's only guide in a building whirlwind of events.<br /><br />Donnie is surrounded by a family almost as odd as he is, a psychiatrist determined to drug him into sanity, a kiddie porn maker who does motivational speaking on the side, and a love interest (Jena Malone) that lays the groundwork for a stunning conclusion.  Gyllenhaal's performance captures the inner discontinuities of a character whose world alternates clarity with hallucination, leaving us to wonder what is real and what is inadvertent juxtaposition.<br /><br />As a film, Donnie Darko is as deep as you want to take it in a range between pure spookiness and metaphysics.  By the time I hit the closing credits I found it hard to believe that a modern director would take the risks that Kelly did with this film, and very glad that the risks were taken.  There is a lot of fine detail in the settings and scene action that only gradually sink in.  This was a much more carefully made film than it appears on first contact.<br /><br />By all means see this for its creative adventurism if nothing else.  Stay to watch it a few times and you will find it eerily optimistic despite the tragic thrust of its central story.  In the end you may very well feel as happily perplexed as I did.much more carefully made film than it appears on first contact.    By all means see this for its creative adventurism if nothing else.

B000002HRE|3.0|There are better songs on this album than the radio hits like \\"Fuel\\" \\"The Memory Remains\\" and \\"Unforgiven 2\\", which is actually a good thing becouse those are not the very best tracks on RELOAD.<br /><br /> If your a tried and true lover of Metallica, and if you actually take a little time to listen through the songs, you might see that  \\"Devil's Dance\\" is a good song. That song near the end has James sort of pushing his vocal range, reminiscent of Freddie Mercury's power from QUEEN.<br /><br />\\"Better Than You\\" and \\"Slither\\" are not bad, they are allright, with good lyrics with that attitude that James puts into the songs.<br /><br /> The song \\"Carpe Diem Baby\\" is a good song, with good lyrics and how its sung is inspired and has some power.<br /><br />\\"Bad Seed\\" is another song that isnt bad, it has a good chorus part, its ok. The chorus that sings all together is the highlight i think of the song that sings<br />\\" Swing the noose again, Pierce the apples skin , Bit more than you need, now youre chok'n on a bad seed\\"...that part sounds pretty good.<br /><br />Now the song \\" Where The Wild Things Are \\" is the best song on the album, the most creative of them all i think. Best lyrics and has the single best guitar solo on the entire cd. Could of been done on pre-load era albums if the style was altered to Metal. The style it has dark superior lyrics, and a sound that is slightly similar to something dark done by Alice In Chains. And im sure Alice In Chains was influenced by Metallica.<br /><br />\\"Prince Charming\\" is a good song, another dark lyrically driven song that speaks directly to you with its old-school-esque rock attitude, that James Hetfeild and the rest of Metallica seem to create well. Its the same dark \\"friend\\" one first found in \\" SAD BUT TRUE\\" and later lamented about in \\" Until It Sleeps\\" of earlier Metallica songs , of the Black album and Load variety.<br />Atleast thats one way to see it. But \\"Prince Charming\\" is NOT anything like \\"Sad But True\\" , dont let there be any confusion. Its more the self appointed bad ass attitude you find in this album. What ever that means.<br /><br /> \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" is another good song, but is different, its a little moving, sort of, in a way. I describe this song as 'TRAVELED' , i hear that traveled feeling in some of Metallicas later songs like this. The song is good, it has meaning.<br /><br /> \\"Attitude\\" is the song that is just self explainitory, its not awefull, its a little bit more of the same i think, the same feel, but with different melody. I think by now it be safe to call it 'FILLER' if not allready lol. but its not a crap song, its just there basically, idk lol.<br /><br />The final song called \\" Fixxxer \\" is a good song, yet again, and again is a tad reminiscent of some QUEEN, but this time in the guitar part. If you are a lover of QUEEN's you'll recognise it.<br />Metallica , i think its fair to say, in one of way or another has been very much influenced by QUEEN. I invite to listen to the song \\"INUENDO \\" by Queen and wait to hear what would sound to be an old school Metallica riff, its pretty awesome.<br /><br />But anyways that is getting off subject, to say the least.<br /><br />The bottom line is RELOAD is a good album and along with LOAD has helped the band explore themselves musically and do things they used not be able to do since it was all \\" METAL UP YOUR ASS\\"<br /><br />Find a good price on this album here on Amazon and buy it if your despret for some more Metallica besides the pre-load era albums.ppointed bad ass attitude you find in this album.

B0000041LL|1.0|These were the first recordings of these works that I encountered as a young listener. There wasn't a great selection of complete sets of Beethoven's quartets back then. I purchased the set on LP's and more or less steered clear of these works for a number of years until I heard other performances. Quartetto Italiano's (QI) boring performances of these dynamic masterpieces are among the worst on the market. In fact, the only set I can recall that would fall into this dismal class would be that by the Orford Quartet on the Delos label. I have no intention of purchasing the set on CDs, and when I have gone back to the LP's on occasion, I have only found that my original impression of these performances was absolutely correct.<br /><br />The most significant problem with this set is that its chosen tempi are consistently too slow resulting in a disruption of the flow and vital rhythms of this music. Too many amateur listeners (and some professional critics) equate slow tempi for depth of emotion and insight. A good example of what I am talking about can be found in the first movement of the Op.127 quartet marked \\"maestoso - allegro\\" (majestic, grand - cheerful, quick). There simply isn't anything majestic, grand, cheerful, or quick in QI's performance. Compared to say, performances by the Yale String Quartet, the Hollywood String Quartet, the Bartok Quartet, and others, QI's is plodding and lifeless.<br /><br />Cycles by the Bartok, Borodin, Tokyo, Cleveland, and Alban Berg - to name the best - come closest to the intentions of Beethoven, and are all around much more enjoyable to listen to. Other quartets that haven't finished a complete cycle, but also easily outshine QI in this repertoire are the Petersen and Turner quartets. If you are just looking for \\"pretty\\" Beethoven, stick with QI. If you want \\"Beethoven\\" Beethoven, go with the others.<br /><br />While I have enjoyed QI's performances of Mozart's string quartets, there are a number of better performances of those pieces now in the catalogue. Those of the Suske, Mosaiques, and Alban Berg come to mind.catalogue. Those of the Suske, Mosaiques, and Alban Berg come to mind.
1573228214|5.0|If any of you know a guy who is having trouble growing up, who is jumping from short term relationship to short term relationship and not being able to settle down, then be sure to point them in the direction of this book.  Why this book?  Because Nick Hornby, the author, does a great job of capturing the struggle that some men go through as they move between that awkward stage of wanting to play games and never settle down, vs. the desire to get into serious relationships and start that nesting phase of life.<br />Now while this might seem like a touchy-feely novel, it isn't.  Hornby deftly stick handles through what might be a dangerous topic only to cover the subject with humour and excellent observations.  And while at first glance this might novel appear to be target to men only, women should find an interest in this novel too, as it provides a good glimpse in to how men think and operate.<br />This book most definitely rates five stars for having human and believable characters, a story line that everyone no matter their age or sex or race can follow, and a writing style that is easy to read.  Never mind the many references to cool bands and the great music scene found in London.<br />Even if you saw the movie, you should still pick up the book and give it a read.  The novel does a much better job of capturing the struggle experienced by the protagonist, and better still, the novel is set in London rather than the movie locale of Chicago.  For anyone looking for their first Nick Hornby novel, this would be the one to give them.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead were stuck after Ok Computer, the album that brought them critical acclaim and great album sales. Radiohead didnt want all the fame and acclaim, so whats an isolationist band to do? Well for one indulge almost entirely in electronica and leave behind almost any trace of anything that could be considered mildly catchy and/or commercial. Kid A is an exercise in mood over rhythm, and perhaps even style over substance. Where Ok Computer was already far from mainstream rock, Kid A is leaps and bounds beyond it, even the album cover leaves one with a cold and removed feeling. Yorke's lyrics are even more bleak and depressing and the music itself sounds like it was recorded in a UFO; the core of the band, the bass, drums, guitars and vocals, are saturated in electronic bleepings and distorted phasers. Yorke even publically claimed that with Kid A Radiohead were trying to weed out some of its massive fan base, much as Kurt Coban and Nirvana attempted to do with In Utero. The result was a cryptic, nearly unaccessible record that increased their popularity and was hailed on many \\"best of\\" lists. Yorke and company combined the electronica of Aphex Twin and the mood pieces and obtuse art rock of Brian Eno to birth this difficult album, the brass section on \\"The National Anthem\\" even brings to mind Captain Beefheart's squealing epic Trout Mask Replica, another notoriously difficult to digest album. This is definitely a step in the right direction, this is in essence what 21st century rock should sound like and I compliment Radiohead for their accomplishment, though I have to say their initial mission has failed.
B000003AEB|5.0|This is rap at its best. <br />Its one of those CD's where you can just play it through without skipping any tracks because every single one is a classic. <br />Snoop is definitley the best thing (bar Eminem) to be produced by Dre.

B0002OERI0|3.0|OK So wen I First listened to this cd It sounded like the greatest album ever. As it did for the second and third time. However after that, about 1/2 the tracks started getting kinda boring. And now that i look back on it, the whole reason why it seemed so good to me, and everyone else was that, it wasn't just the greatest rock album of 2004, IT WAS THE ONLY ALBUM OF 2004!!!! ANYONE WHO SAW THE OPENING ACT OF THE GRAMMYS COULD TELL THAT WE HAD AN EXTREMLY SH*TTY YEAR IN MUSIC. I MEAN COME ON  U2, THE BLACK EYED PEAS, AND GWEN STEFANI DEMONSTRATING ONE OF THE BIGGEST SELLOUTS IN HISTORY, AND THEN THERE WAS MAROON 5. Another thing is that i was comparing it to warning and shenanigans, which flat out sucked, but either way here is a rundown of the tracks. <br />   <br />   1) When i first heard this song, i loved it. then it got overplayed as hell on the radio and now i'm sick of it. <br /> <br />   2) probably my favorite song on the album, i'm not sure y tho. <br /> <br />    3) ok this song rips off london calling by the clash so bad it's not even funny. catchy chorus tho. <br />    4) see one <br />     5) ok, a little slow tho. <br />     6)eh <br />     7 Hilarious. Give me novacaine!! lol great song <br />     8) eh <br />     9) boring <br />     10) ok this song is awesome, kinda reminds me of insomniac a bit. <br />     11) give me a break this song is so pathetic <br />     12) eh <br />      13)Boring <br />  <br />       So overall. is it punk. in other words shall i laugh from not to eternity at how rediculuos that is. Green day were never genuwine punk but they came close with insomniac kerplunk, and dookie. However once you get over that, this is definatly a comeback from the monstrocity that was warning (all the songs sucked) it is about where nimrod was, only nimrod had a bit more balls except for good riddance.
0743490304|5.0|I have read all the books by this author and I think this one is by far the best.  I even liked this better than the Da Vinci Code.  I found it hard to put down.  It's a real edge of your seat, nail biter.  It has romance, mystery, and deception at the highest ranks.  Highly recommended!
B000002BPS|5.0|OK first of all i'll admit that my first hearing of the offspring(tho i've heard of them for awhile previously) was listening to pretty fly(for a white guy) which I found to be a pretty cool song cuz it was cynical about those wangster losers who i'm forced to stay in contact with. However, I was wondering why everyone, and their dog was accusing the offspring of \\"selling out.\\" So I picked up a copy of one of there earlier albums (this one), and although it took a couple of listens to fully appreciate, I can now see why. Ixnay on the hombre is sooo great it makes pretty fly sound like generic fluff by comparison. Except for that one \\"amazed\\" song, every song here is instantly memorable. But one of the most hilarious things about this cd is john mayer (the mondo-corporate-pop-mtv-wuss) appearing in the intermission. Who would of guessed? Either way i guess the point is tath this is just a great album from the disclaimer ( \\"this american apple pie institution known as parental descretion, might clense any sense of innuendo from lyrics that might actually make sense while insulting your intellegence at the same time\\"), to Change the world  (\\"Go listen to heavy metal. Kiss my ass\\") and is definatly worth buying.

0060578793|5.0|You know, reading this book, one might get the impression that it was developed by and for crazy war vets who are completely paranoid about getting stranded on a desert island and left for dead. Which is a good thing, because it is filled with invaluable knowledge about making shelter, fire, food, first aid, how to make deadly traps for animals or angry cannabilizing natives, well, actually I kind of adlibbed that one but you could definitely manufacture a trap deadly enough to kill one or even many people. kind of scary, actually but I think this should be mandatory reading for all US citizens just because it teaches us preparedness for the most harsh of all unexpected circumstances.

B0002KQNJU|3.0|This is one of those campy films that you just have to love.  The plot is thin, but the laughs are big.  It most certainly is not meant to be anything except mindless entertainment.  My 15 year old daughter tells me that the music is very wierd, and that the sound is to low to actually hear what they are saying. She seemed to like turning on the sub-titles. All of her friends also said that it is to weird, but it still goes to all of the teen parties with her.  <br />Overall, it is a funny film that has no redeaming social value. <br /> <br />I really liked the movie when it first came out, but over time I think that it has not held up all that well. <br />Give it a look if you like.  Easily worth 10 bucks for the DVD, but no more than that. <br /> <br />Jonathan <br />   <br />  <br />

B0007Y08IS|5.0|Anyone that grew up in the sixties with the original \\"Thunderbirds\\" marionette \\"cartoon\\"/show can appreciate this film. Once I saw the trailer I knew it was a spoof on marionettes. No one else seemed to get it. There are no holds barred on this film, it is a world wide satire on EVERYTHING!! They make fun of marionettes (some call them \\"puppets\\", but that is a misnomer), the U.S., Iraq, North Korea, actor-activists, you name it. If anyone has told you that it leans this way or that politically, they are mistaken, it is all over the place. No one is safe. This film is absolutely hilarious. Period. One warning though, DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS! It is filthy.<br /><br />I think it's funny that people from other countries don't think that we in the U.S. would think it was funny. Just shows how they THINK that they know us and they don't know us at all! Most U.S. citizens do not fit into this stereotype. Someone is watching too many hollywood movies!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against the Machine had a hell of a career, if a bit too brief.  Their debut was brilliant, but I find Battle of LA to be the band's most distinct and impressive work.  Nearly every song on this album is memorable and stands out in its own way, and the songs have a larger-than-life quality and sense of authority that most heavy music lacks today.    The sounds and dynamics of 'Battle' are crunchy and in-your-face, and give the album that epic feel.  Even with the shorter tracks, the band never slacks off; the sounds on this album are creative and original and never fail to entertain.  RATM was always a band with a political message, but they knew how to have fun with it and make it entertaining and energetic.  Born of a Broken man, my favorite song on the album and one of my personal all-time favorite songs in general, is especially heavy and driving, not to mention atmospheric and beautiful.      Fans of metal love to bash RATM mainly because of Tom Morello and his refusal to sound like every other guitarist out there.  To you people: get lost (to put it lightly).  A virtuoso guitarist is not one who shreds the fastest, he is one who knows his own music well and creates a dynamic sound that makes the songs work.  For example, Dave Mustaine is one of my favorite guitarists out there, and he's fast and very technical, but he still could not replicate Morello's sound, riffs, or solos.  Only Morello can.    As for the people bashing RATM for their political stance: politics and music go hand-in-hand.  Always have, always will.  And I'm sure Morello has more of a right to talk politics than most politicians do.    Overall Battle of Los Angeles is nothing short a masterpiece.  As the title says, I consider this to be one of the last true epics of rock.  And for the rock/metal elitists who whine about this not being \\"real rock\\" or \\"real metal\\" for its rap and techno influences, think again.  This is creative metal set to groove and rhythm, and it rules.
0553573403|5.0|Even though A Game of Thrones starts a little slow, Martin creates an intense and thoroughly believable world. In Martin's world, the good guys don't always finish first!  The plot twists almost to the breaking point; and the characters are surprisingly complex.  But be warned, this is not a children's fantasy.  All in all, it's an intriguing story told by a master of storytelling!  Like so many other fans, I'm eagerly waiting for the next book!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Being a much more song-driven record than \\"Kid A\\", \\"Amnesiac\\" also offers an opportunity for more hooks and \\"moments\\" (so to speak) than \\"Kid A\\" did. That being said, where its predecessor succeeds in putting together a cohereant, pulsating album, \\"Amnesiac\\" contains more of what I would call \\"blips\\". Thom's voice is as always, and it usually either loved or hated by fans (I tend to vary based on the particular song).    There are group of songs, those that would score about 4-4.5/5, on my scale. Pyramid Song is solid, but lacking in any progression, with the exception of some excellent lyrics and a strange drum inclusion. Morning Bell/Amnesiac is a redux of the song from \\"Kid A\\", and I actually perfer this haunting version, with a background chorus and acoustic guitar. Hunting Bears is an interesting instrumental, guitar based and very moody. Leads well into the next track, Like Spinning Plates. Knives Out starts off very similar to Dollars and Cents. It's nice to see a straight up, alternative rock song on this album of oddities, especially with such amazing vocals and a neat little guitar solo.     Now for the REALLY good. I Might be Wrong completely rocks out, on a central, absolutely killer guitar riff. This track showcases the most perfect blend of rocker and synth-based work that Radiohead has ever done. The ending is also a nice touch. The album's closer, Life in a Glasshouse is also stellar, it really picks up at the end, with a full jazz ensemble, an emotional end to the album. Like Spinning Plates is also amazing, doing with minimalism what Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors could not. The melody is beautiful, and the lyrics are completely intense. I truly cannot stress how incredible this song is, lyrically, melody, everything. The opener, Packt Like Sardines, is another awesome vocal performance, and is different, because it is structured like a rocker, but is entirely electronic. Weird. Finally, You and Whose Army is probably my favourite track on here, openingwith just a slightly muted piano and Thom's best vocal performance on the record. The lyrics invoke mockery, a lovely clash with the beauty of the piano. At around 2 minutes, everything explodes, as the track finishes with an anthemic ending, highlighted by Thom's haunting vocal melodies. Killer.    Then, there are the song that need a few (hundred) listens to appreciate/understand. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors is one of those, an entirely electronic song, based on a strange, rotating beat. Thom's voice is totally manipulated by electronics, I don't particularly care for it here, but the lyrics are astounding. Some of the arbitrary ambience that comes in is nice, this is definitely a song to be listened to in the dark, alone in order to grasp every layer of music that is being presented. The other oddity on this album that may not seem like one on a first glance is Dollars & Cents. It sounds \\"rock\\" enough (relatively speaking, remember the album that I'm reviewing). The lyrics here reflect the Thom Yorke tradition of having a couple of anti-capitalist themed tracks on each album. This song is very monotonous, but then again, this is relatively speaking. Thom's voice is acting as the lead instrument here, and enters some chaos around 2 minutes in, then chills out for a while on a bass line. Both of these songs can't really be rated, they are terribly subjective, but cannot be ignored.    So there you have it, Radiohead's strangest, but also much appealing album (in this reviewers opinion). Like it or loathe it, \\"Amnesiac\\", much like \\"Ok Computer\\", is required listening.
0440237688|4.0|The first time I ever read this book was back in grade school, I think I was about 12.  I had to read it twice because it was so amazing to me, a world that was perfect, but not.  Recently, I just saw a movie titled \\"Equilibrium\\".  It has the same theme.  No pain or war but also no love.  Feelings were outlawed.  The movie was definitely no blockbuster, and it was pretty violent, but it reminded me of this book.  After seeing the movie, I had to read this book again.  I'm 23, and to this day this book has stuck with me.  I would recomend this to anyone, young and old just because it makes you think of what it would be like to live that kind of life and if you would have the courage as Jonas did to show the community what it was missing.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin's true genuis was crystalized on their fourth album released in November of 1971. The acoustic experimentation of LZ III combined with the raw, powerful hard blues rock of their first two lps reached its culmanation with the untitled album. Everything that Led Zeppelin's music represented was present here in all its earth shattering glory. Key tracks are obvious and represent the greatest music in the history of Rock n'Roll: \\"Black Dog\\" (my personal favorite- check out the version on 'How the West Was Won\\", ridiculous!!), \\"Rock n' Roll\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" (greatest drums in history) and of course \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", anthem of all anthems. These songs need no further introduction and are mythic in our popular culture (hello Cadillac). More energy should be expended to chronicle the beauty of \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Going to California\\", proving once and for all the Zeppelin could do it all. I find it extremely curious that when VH1 rated the 100 greatest albums ever (back in 1999 or 2000) that this one was not one of the three Zeppelin albums chosen (only 3???). Are those people alright?? Anyway, four symbols represent the essential elements of what makes timeless music. Each member of the band created a template of top musicianship that still resonates thirty four years later as the crowning achievement in the history of rock music. Whether or not you like Zeppelin is irrelevant, this is fact. Again, what is up with idiots posting reviews of music they couldn't possibly understand. Anyway, messieurs Page, Jones, Bonham and Plant immortalized themselves in the fall of 1971 and forever since as the premier rock band of all time (along with the Stones).

B00065JTBA|5.0|This is a great box set and worth every cent.  Not only hearing because of the diffent versions of released songs, not only because of the unreleased songs.  Not even just because of the DVD of backstage and interview footage.

0375703764|2.0|I like horror, so when I heard of the House of Leaves I had to pick it up.  It was very difficult for me to read 2 stories at the same time and I very quickly grew frustrated.  To complete the story, the only thing I could do was read the actual story of the House.  I realize the problem is my own, as I like a quick and straight read.  For those of you who can concentrate on more than one story at a time - this is a great book.  I rated it a 2 because I grew so frustrated with it, but I did enjoy the story itself.  For those of you who grow frustrated with the switch in narration, I would suggest you just read the main story first and pick up the rest later.  It is a good book, but I found it daunting at times.

B00005JLR8|5.0|There are few movies out there that can truly touch the heart,and 'In America' is certainly one of them.It is a moving story about the hardships faced by an irish family that has just moved to New York City,and have recently lost their young son do to a tragic fall down the stairs.It a simple yet powerful tale that is extremely life affirming,and ill bet like me you will shed a tear or to at the end of this wonderful film.All of the performances are outstanding(especially the 2 young girls),and the movie will stay with you long after it is over.I highly recommend that everyone see this movie,and that you tell everyone you know about it,because it deserves to be seen and appreciated.Its one of the best films of the decade and will certainly stand the test of time.
B0002S947K|5.0|Absolutely amazing first works from Ray Lamontagne. I am in complete agreement with everything all of the other [top] reviews have said about \\"Trouble\\".  I am not going to reinvent the wheel by restating the facts. My favorite song on the album is \\"Hold You In My Arms\\".  <br />Here is a sampling of the lyrics :  <br />\\"So now we see how it is  <br />This fist begets the spear  <br />Weapons of war  <br />Symptoms of madness  <br />Don't let your eyes refuse to see  <br />Don't let your ears refuse to hear  <br />Or you ain't never going to shake this sense of sadness \\" <br /> <br />I look forward to future works from Mr. Lamontagne!
B0002IQJUK|4.0|After hearing and liking the three singles off this album on the radio I reasoned that if I liked three songs I would probably like the rest.  Well, I was right there.  Gavin blends his strong, sincere voice with creative lyrics and fresh beats to make songs that stick in your head long after the CD is over. <br /> <br />The most listenable songs are Follow Through, Chariot, I Don't Want To Be, (Nice To Meet You) Anyway, and More Than Anyone.  But really, there aren't any \\"filler\\" songs here, just fun, catchy tunes. <br /> <br />A cool Bonus: the Stripped CD.  It creates a more laid-back mood and is just a nice addition to his regular album.

044024157X|5.0|when willie traynor arrives in mississippi in 1970 and buys a small bankrupt local paper, his hopes are not high. but through innovative writing and the crime of the decade, his subscriptions jump sky high. for the crime is murder and one of the most feared families in the county has one of their own up for the murder. he is found guilty but only serves less than a decade and is released and all of a sudden juror members start turning up dead. coincidence??? must read the book. <br /> <br />this book takes you in for nearly 10 years of living in a small town in the south, back to a decade where civil rights were just being defined and showing how you can change the laws but that don't mean you change people's hearts. but it is well written and it gave me a better understanding of my parents childhood who were raised in the state of mississippi in a small town not unlike clanton. makes you want to go down there and get a house and move right in. almost.(i couldn't take the heat and mosquitoes but that just says a lot about the writer).
B00012BD0S|5.0|When I have the money, I always look for something new and different in Metal, and Symphony X delivers everything that I listen for in terms of sound. While staying on the emotional side, the band keeps things nice and heavy through out the entire album. Quite easily one of the best, and most impressive songs on this album is the twenty minute long epic: \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\". I won't go into describing the song, because it'll spoil the surprise if you have not heard it yet. My favorite songs on this album are:  \\"Sea of Lies\\", \\"The Accolade\\", \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\", and \\"Candlelight Fantasia.\\" All in all, Symphony X is a great band to add to your collection, highly recommended for fans of \\"Evergrey\\", \\"Blind Guardian\\", \\"Kamelot\\" \\"Sonata Artica\\", etc...
B000805796|4.0|Beautiful Intentions is the third Melanie C album and her first on her new Redgirl record label. <br /> <br />The album is generally a collection of her now established soft rock/hard pop style songs with the first single Next Best Superstar  having hit the top 10 in the UK she's established her new label with a bang. <br /> <br />The album is less ambitious than Northern Star and to be honest doesn't have any high points as high as Going Down or Northern Star; however; it doesn't have any of the cringingly bad moments that blighted NS either.  <br /> <br />Co-writing all the songs here it's obvious she's getting a lot more involved in the background and her song writings coming on (no \\"I couldn't live without my phone you don't even have a home moments\\") . <br /> <br />This is a more memorable album than reason, currently available in a handsome slipcased edition (don't get too excited it's still only the 1 cd it's just in a nice slip case.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent little album well worth a listen I'm not going to review tracks in detail as that's already been done if you're in the UK over the next few weeks she''s currently on tour doing a matinee acoustic set and signing in places she's playing live in the evening (harrass her website if you want an accoustic album she's up for it if there's a demand) <br /> <br /> <br />   <br />little album and nice to see at least one of the Spice Girls
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|As a big Clint fan, I've grown disappointed by his work over the last 20 or so years.  His direction is often slow, and the material he's chosen has been subpar.  'Mystic River', however, was great.  Fascinating characters, great atmosphere, interesting story, good subtext, and great direction.  The movie moves along nicely, but not too fast for its own good.  It's good to see Clint getting it together after so many recent 2 and 1/2 star movies.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|It seems supremely ironic that two of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work have taken place in prisons:  THE GREEN MILE and this mesmerizing drama, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  With director/screenwriter Frank Darabont's careful execution, this movie offers us Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in some of their most outstanding film work.  Years later, both actors would win supporting actor Oscars, which can only be inclusive of their work in this film as well.  As far as its length goes, I think Darabont wanted us to experience the time factor of being locked up in a prison, where hope is certainly not on the menu for these doomed gentlemen.  As the movie unfolds, we are treated to some fine characterizations and superb, understated performances.  In addition to the brilliant work from Robbins and Freeman, savor the other performers:  Bob Gunton as Warden Norton, a Bible spouting hypocrite who uses Robbins to become a wealthy man; James Whitmore as Brooks, who after fifty years of incarceration is set free and cannot face life in the outside world; William Sadler as the loud-mouthed but affable prisoner; Clancy Brown as the brutal and vindictive guard; Gil Bellows in his brief but powerful turn as Tommy, whose fate only vilifies the corrupt warden even more.  With a marvelous score by Thomas Newman and the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a powerful examination of the power of hope, and a dazzling cinematic experience.

0060930187|5.0|I was reading down the reviews for The Bell Jar to see what other's thought of one of my favorite books, and I noticed something that was lacking.  From what I saw, many of the reviewers saw Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiography as a have-to-read classic, or as well written.  Ouch.  I think Sylvia Plath would be spinning in her grave to here such dry words about her one and only novel. <br /> <br />I suffered from severe depression.  I could not find words to give to the doctors to describe all of the feelings that go along with the illness.  So one day I brought in my copy of the Bell Jar, and I pointed out specific parts that echoed the madness in my head.  I am not making this up as a sappy story.  Sylvia Plath's writing is so real to me, that it has always held a special place in my heart. <br /> <br />So, lets say you are not crazy, and can not have such a visceral experience as I had.  Read The Bell Jar.  Plath's words are so powerful, the poetry that fills each page is so strong.  I will admit that I got mildly disinterested near the beginning, but (dont want to give to much away) all of the events that lead to the pivotal point in the book, and all the of events that follow, are charged with electricity and passion.  This is a woman's fight for life, and everyone should pick up a copy to enhance their own.
B00000HZTB|3.0|This is a good Lou Reed album, but a \\"masterpiece\\"?  Uh...not at all, in my opinion.  Robert Quine's guitar sounds nice.  \\"Waves of Fear\\" is a great track.  \\"My House\\" has some nice lyrics.  \\"The Day John Kennedy Died\\" is well-intended, but very schmaltzy.  And the rest is no better or worse than anything on \\"Growing Up in Public\\" - compare the two, folks.  There ain't much difference.  A much better album is LEGENDARY HEARTS from 1983.  Lou's previous masterpiece was STREET HASSLE, prior to BLUE MASK, and he wouldn't have another until NEW YORK in 1989.<br /><br />BLUE MASK is just another good Lou Reed album, nothing special.
0345446798|5.0|I own all of her books, though I have not read them all YET!  8-} <br />But I read this one and LOVE it!  It is THE book to give people who have a dog but  do not cherish it as a member of the family yet.  <br />
B000002WPI|5.0|This album is probably the one album in my collection of probably a hundred or more CDs that is consistently in my CD changer's regular rotation. I got it in junior high when it came out and it's been my favorite album ever since, even after Tupac, even after Notorious B.I.G., even after Illmatic, Jay-Z and definitely even after all the cash money and G-unit artistic debacles (albeit ill-deserved monetary triumphs). This album is my favorite simply because it is the epitome of what hip hop should be: creative emcee'ing, useful (and not irrelevant, overdone) sampling, infectuous beats, and connectivity with urban life, and not the idiotic \\"hey I'm rich look at me now, losers\\" approach taken by such hip hop frauds as 50 cent. Not that Wu-Tang or Biggy or Nas never talk about making money, but they do so in an artistic and more importantly ironic way in that they convey the hunger and desperation of hoods to aim for \\"cream\\" that average urban young people can relate to, instead of the dumba$$sed way that many rappers today flaunt wealth and rap about people still in the hood as though they are worthless. <br /> <br />Wu-Tang could say \\"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang! over and over again but it actually worked since it was actually like a tribal chant. <br /> <br />G-G-G-Unit! I don't think so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The tracks on this album are ordered in such a way that one song segues naturally into the next so that after one listens to it they feel as though they have truly gone a long way toward understanding real hip hop, at least from the clan's perspective. Standout tracks for me, were (numbered as they appear on the album): <br /> <br />1. Bring da Ruckus   - minimalist beat, ghostface really shines as the lead-off rhymer on this track <br /> <br />2. Shame on a Nigga  - ODB (R.I.P.)somehow manages to be hilarious and f'ing ill at the same time on this track, as he is on others. It's hard to imagine that he was only 25 or so when he rhymed on the track; most people thinkof him as an actual, old man since he sounds a lot like a lot of peoples' crazy uncle or grandpa.   <br /> <br />3. Clan in da Front - another minimalist beat that works well with the rhymes spat  <br /> <br />5. Can It Be All So Simple - a surprisingly energetic albeit laid-back song, with poignant rhymes. don't miss this one <br /> <br />6. Mystery of Chessboxin' - for me, the best Wu track EVER. ODB and Masta Killa (appearing for the one and only time on this particular album) are particularly outstanding. Only ODB can get away with rhyming \\"boom!\\" with \\"just warmin' up a lil' bit, vroom vroom!\\"  listen to masta killa's verse at the end and you'll be amazed. \\"We have an APB on an MC killa! Looks like the work of a master, evidence in a case of this stature indicates a terrorist -- merciless hard to capture.\\" \\"I'm movin' on a n***a' with the speed of a centipede -- a ninja, any muthaf***ing condender.\\" <br />  <br />He's just so f'ing sick.       <br /> <br /> <br />8. C.R.E.A.M. -- even people in their 60s know the chorus of this one. Check it.      <br /> <br />9. Method Man -- he shows how awesome he used to be before he signed onto that ridiculous self-titled \\"let's amuse white people with our non-threatening ghettoisms\\" sitcom with fellow \\"I used to write better songs\\" rapper Redman.      <br /> <br />10. Protect Ya Neck - great track, unforgettable beat. the only thing though, on my copy the song seems to have all the profanity edited. wtf?     <br /> <br /> <br />Buy this album -- do yourself a favor! Do me a favor, too &lt;3. Do everyone a favor. Do hip hop a favor.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had never seen the stage production previous to seeing The Phantom of the Opera movie.  I can't really say anything bad about the movie.  I'm not going to go into explicit detail here, the only \\"bad\\" thing I have to say is the fact that they dubbed in Carlotta's singing voice.  Now, I have no problem with the fact that Minnie Driver couldn't sing the part, but clearly was AMAZING at it acting wise.  I just disagree with them using another cast member's voice.  It would've been fine if Margaret Preece didn't have a solo in Il Muto right before Carlotta sings.  It was so obvious their voices were from the same person.  Other than that I loved this freakin' movie, and cannot WAIT until next Tuesday to buy it!

B00005JMXX|3.0|I want you to make a picture in your mind. Picture a studio room, with some really imaginative people inside of it. They are loaded with money. They go on their computers and spend and spend and spend and use lots of nature and special effects and camera views and just do whatever they can to make you think \\"hey, that looks pretty neat.\\" This is what the directors did while making this. <br />    But there is a drawback. After doing all this, they thought \\"hey wait a second! this is a movie! darn it! ok lets add a script and quickly get some actors and all that\\" and they did that quickly, with no effort at all. They used a billion formulas, made it so hollywood and not original whatsoever, but theres some cool stuff to see. They have money, but they do not have talent. The acting was complete ****. Sorry for cursing, but I cannot find a more suitable word. Jake Gylenhal was great in Donnie Darko, but awful in this. It's weird. All of the actors overdid their roles, and the whole science thing was totally stupid. The script is awful. The music is awful. The acting is awful. Everything is awful, except the visual stuff. So what is the moral? Get lots of money, and you will succeed. I guess so. However, I would recommend this to a lot of children. It really expands your imagination, and kids don't care about much in movies, which is actually a good thing. So go see it, just take it as a movie about the visuality, and not a movie that's actually good.
6305696071|1.0|Plausible story of a rich homosexual man who falls in love with a dirty prostitute. Makes sense. Happens all the time. <br />I may not be able to sit through the romantic shy-girl-gets-the-guy movies because they sicken me, but I'll take \\"Dirty Dancing\\" and \\"Ice Princess\\" and many others in the braindead chick-flick vein to avoid having to watch this. <br />If I were a Dad, I would ban this movie from my children's viewing, be they boys or girls. Because this movie sends out every possible wrong message.... <br />Prostitution is a way to get by. Like waitressing to put yourself through school. Hey, maybe it's even glamorous. These girls seem to be having fun, right? <br />Why NO scenes of Julia smoking crack, being gang raped, or getting razored by her pimp for not bringing in enough dash? Too real, I guess. Takes away from the fairy tale, like that bummer \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" reality check flick. <br />Oh, and money equals love. Big Richie doesn't do much more than buy her stuff and get her into froo-froo stores for snobs to prove his devotion. How can women sit through a movie like this? I am a straight man and even I'm offended! <br />The only good thing about the movie is Roy Orbison's song, which was ruined for me once it became associated with this atrocity. <br />Julia Roberts should be ashamed of herself, for making generations of girls think that sex for cash can and will transform into love, riches and a Cinderella-like fantasy world of magic.  <br />Everyone involved in making this should be slain!!!!!
0790749815|4.0|It's one of Hitchcock's later movies. He puts his signature cameo in the first few minutes of the movie, so people will get on with watching it instead of playing the \\"where's Waldo\\" game of finding him.<br /><br />It's also an American classic. Some of the scenes have truly become part of the culture's visual memory: the crop-duster chase, climbing across Mt. Rushmore, and of course the train and tunnel. It's a good action movie, 1950s style, with Cary Grant - what more needs to be said?<br /><br />Here in the next century, perhaps a few more things. This is remarkable as an artifact of the cold war, which provided entire basis for the plot. It's also noteworthy as a snapshot of 1950s style. I don't just mean clothes, though the women's styles have a quaint look now. I mean the railroad sleeper cars (do they even exist now?), the Prairie School architecture as the height of sophistication, and the morals of a simpler era. I'm also interested in that chase across that most reconizable of American monuments, as if the gunfire represented an attack on all of America's citizens at once. Well, I guess that's how the Cold War eye really saw the world.<br /><br />Among Hitchcock's movies, it's not the one that builds tension the best - \\"The Birds\\" is a lot more nerve-wracking, for example. It's still a good one, for itself and for the 1950s sensibility that it has frozen in time.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0006399FS|1.0|I feel that U2 are becomimg another rock dinosaur to be embarrassed about and havent managed to get excited about much theyve done since POP. <br /> <br />With this extremely overhyped overestimated comeback U2 have just followed a winning formula from the last one ATYCLB. <br /> <br />Not only did they sell out to the new evil of ipod even before the album was released, but they now fail to interest me for more than two songs on the album. Which is something I cant forgive in a well established supposed legendary band.  <br /> <br />If this was their first album, I think they would never be heard of again. The only reason this album will do well is because of the thousands upon thousands of die hard loyal fans. Thank God I downloaded it instead of wasting good money. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle isn't the monumental album we've come to expect - or deserve - from the hype-machine that surrounds this album. It's time for U2 to risk it all and push forward. <br /> <br />This album chronicles steady U2's decline into mediocrity.  The band don't sound musically competent and strive for nothing more that a rehash of past glories. Bono's lyrics on this album are the worst he's ever written:  \\"Freedom is little the scent on the top of a newborn babies head.\\"  What the f**k?  In several songs, Bono is \\"on his knees\\" and then he ices this cake with the s**t frosting that is \\"Yahweh,\\" the worst song he's ever written.   <br /> <br />Don't be a sheep, be different: go and buy Zooropa and POP instead and let both ATYCLB and HTDAAB rot under Rolling Stone Magazine's support.
B0000041LO|5.0|There are times - even for the most engaged classical fan - when the denser textures or sudden changes in dynamics of a symphony, concerto or even string quartet cannot quite be processed, but still the musical-person-within desires to hear great music.  Well, for those times - such as a cozy Sunday afternoon reading on the couch - Haydn's piano trios are the perfect prescription for musical bliss and contentment.  And while these trios are lighter in character and texture, they are definately not monotonous, run-of-the-mill divertimenti but rather quite musically intelligent compositions which are exceedingly pleasant, full of exuberance, rich in invention and always in good Haydn taste.    Haydn's Piano Trios is an abundant, marvelous cache of chamber music to explore.  Many are similar in mood and interplay to Mozart's sprightly Piano Trios, while some movements of the late works forshadow Beethoven's expressivity.  Haydn's piano trios never cease to delight with their classical balance, lightness-of-heart, bubbly joy and smooth textures.   One reason for such a proliferation of works in the piano-trio genre in Haydn's time is that the home market for such compositions was exploding in mid-18th century with seemingly every middle to upper class household now owning this new, must-have musical instrument - the clavier.     The Beaux Arts Trio do great justice to this works and show they really care and enjoy Haydn's music. The artistry, performance and sound quality of these recordings are superb on all levels which is probably why this set won the impressive awards of \\"Top CD of the Year\\" and a \\"Top 100 Recording\\" from Gramophone - the latter being a supreme compliment.  The crisp, dancing piano tempos from pianist Menahem Pressler in these trios are energetic, sure-footed and delightful, while the two strings bring a rich tonality and elegant mannerism that is most fitting for this genre and period.  As a whole, the Beaux Arts Trio exhibits the kind of natural,seamless musicianship that comes through years of playing together.  Their playing and this CD show classical-era chamber music at its finest, and \\"legendary\\" would not be an out-of-place description of this fine trio.  As of 2005, the trio is now in its 50th year with original member pianist Menahem Pressler still going strong.  All of their recordings still decades later are among the top positions in the ratings in spite of much fine competition (Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms piano trios).  I would say the Haydn Piano Trios are just as enjoyable and musically rich than their Mozart and Beethoven recordings.  I would not be without one set.     For all these reasons, these most-admirable recordings are some of my most frquently played discs in all my collection (I play music all day while studying or working).  Others note this \\"ever-fresh\\" appeal that allows lots of play before any weariness sets in.  So, the quality of recordings, beautiful slim packaging, decent liner notes and exceptional value all combine to make this set a compelling investment for the chamber-music lover. And if you think 9 CD's of piano trios are a lot, consider it a lifetime investment and exploration.
6301763041|5.0|I can only imagine that the popularity of John Waters is due to people under the delusion that they are suppose to like John Waters.  As much as I love Sontag I do have to take exception with the focus on camp as a meaningful medium.  Certainly there is humor in campy fare like the original Batman series, but when do we simply call tripe for what it is?  Cry-Baby, is the greatest example of this, as it is by far the worst film in a list of films by perhaps the most overrated director I have ever come across.  Cry-Baby is not goofy, it is not fun, it is not silly, it is not camp, it is simply a terrible terrible movie.  The acting is abysmal, and I like Johnny Depp.  The story is extremely terrible, and the overall production exemplifies my point: there is no such thing as so bad it is good.  Laughing at a film (as opposed to laughing with a film) for it's low brow style cheesiness doesn't make the film funny.  This movie seriouly belongs on a MST3K style lampoon, but instead people revel in it for what I can only assume is a sensation that they are suppose to like John Waters.  I had a similar sensation when watching Pecker, the other supposed great Waters flick.  If you happen upon this film because you have heard of Waters, and are curious, trust me, he is not an artist, and this film is a waste of time.  Johnny Depp may be a good actor, but sweet mother of all that is holy, even Ed Wood made better films than this.  Avoid John Waters like the plague, because frankly, if I had to choose between dying having the bubonic plague and watching this film again, I would gladly choose the plague.
B00005ARDC|5.0|First and foremost, this is the music of the future!  Black Rebel <br />Motorcycle Club bring their noise-influenced, psychedelic speed <br />of sound to the indie scene.  It was a relief to hear a band like <br />this come out when they did.  Their speed of sound hark back to <br />the indie 80s elite (The Jesus & Mary Chain, Spiritualized, Love <br />& Rockets).  More than that, they have carved their own modern <br />niche to that nostalgic period.  And with this niche, their sound <br />seems to be ahead of its time right now.  Don't be surprised if,  <br />eventually, more and more bands begin to sound like BRMC.   <br /> <br />Their debut is filled with a pleasant mix from the straight- <br />rock-rollin' (Love Burns, Whatever Happened...) to the  <br />smooth-psychedelia (Awake, Salvation) to melodic- <br />heavy (Rifles,Head Up High).  One reason this cd is so  <br />pleasant, it flows nicely from start to finish.  Another,  <br />it always remains fresh and will certainly stand the test of time.   <br />It makes for finesse background music at home, in the office,  <br />or in the car too. <br /> <br />This debut, to say the least, is one of the most impressive <br />debuts from any band to come out in ages.    <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|S. Sigel (reviewer listed herein) is exactly right. This is the best studio album by the Stones. I first bought this album back in the day when there was nothing but vinyl and cassette. I was a new Stones fan and still couldn't accept the pure blues aspect of the band.  <br /> <br />Eric Clapton once said that the blues is the most honest music and that the bluesman represents the man whose back is against the wall--nothing to lose. If you've never listened to this album, well, you'll get a dose of the most honest music, and the image of the man whose back is against the wall. The pure rage, honesty, emotion filled tunes have never been matched by the group--ever again.  <br /> <br />Since then, the group has done what would be the equivalent of double albums in the day of the CD (Voodoo Lounge and Bridges to Babylon). Those albums, although very good, cannot compare to the brutal sounds (I mean that as a compliment) of The Rolling Stones. Just listen to \\"Let it Loose\\", \\"Soul Survivor\\", and the classic \\"Rip This Joint\\": adrenaline supreme. Hopefully the Stones will do that again. Hope it's soon.

B0007OCG4W|1.0|I've noticed a lot of these \\"dramas\\" that everyone raves over as being such a great answer to soulless, Hollywood, action and special effects movies are really just dull, pretentious, artsy fartsy nonsense.  The thing that reveals this movie to be another example of this is the fact that the characters in it just don't behave in a remotely believable fashion.  Julia Roberts' character hooks up first with a man who she learns went to an aquarium to meet her after having cybersex with someone he thought was her the night before (what kind of women are attracted to desperate perverts?).  She then dumps him for a stalker whose followed her around for a year.  Then she dumps the stalker and gets back with Mr. Cybersex after he grovels for her.  What man ever won a woman by grovelling?  What woman ever did anything but hold a man in contempt after he grovelled?  I may not be the world's foremost expert on women, but I do know that women are just plain not attracted to men they don't respect.  And what person respects a grovelling beggar?  Begging and grovelling KILLS attraction.  This character's behavior is so contrary to reality it just kills suspension of belief stone dead.<br /><br />Clive Owen's character grovels and begs for this woman after he learns that she was seeing someone else when he married her, and is now throwing him over for this man.  In other words, the evident fact that she never really loved him, and has been deceiving him over an extended period doesn't seem to upset him all that much.<br /><br />Jude Law's character Grovels in turn for both Julia Roberts' and Natalie Portmans' character, though more realistically he ultimately loses them both.<br /><br />And Natalie Portman can apparently forgive Jude Law for cheating on her, lying to her, and dumping her for another woman, crawling back only after he's lost the other woman.  That's not too much for her.  But apparently she can't forgive him for asking her if she had sex with Clive Owen's character.<br /><br />Excuse me?<br /><br />Do real people act like this?  Not in the world I've lived in all my life they don't.  So how is it good drama to portray people so unbelievably?  I'm sorry, I just can't see what critics find so enchanting about films like this.  The only thing this movie has going for it are first rate actors, and that's not enough to save it.aracter. <br /> <br />Excuse me? <br /> <br />Do real people act like this?

B0007GAERG|5.0|First, those people looking for a trip back to 1990 should hop into a time machine instead of expecting Mariah to recreate all of their fantasies. It's 2005 and Mariah has evolved and so has everyone else. I prefer her voice on this album than any of her others. Her voice sounds the best on \\"We Belong Together.\\" That's the BEST song I've heard her sing. Mariah's voice has improved for the better. I don't know why people would want her to sound exactly the same as she did in 1990 anyways. She's going to have to adapt, adjust, and make slight modifications to her style just like anyone else would. To just come out and sing the identical stuff that you did 15 years ago would be a rather ignorant approach. She has made an effort to recapture some of the essence of the 1990's in overall style and songwriting. Every song sounds like a Mariah Carey song. But she has added a more modern element to it. It was really unavoidable. So vocally, she's just matching what her new material actually requires. I think Mariah has applied her voice more thoughtfully on this CD. It sounds as if she approached each song individually instead of just applying the same vocal technique throughout, which is what her earlier work resembles more.  Mariah really didn't start to experiment with her voice until \\"Butterfly.\\" So \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" combines the efforts undertaken by her debut and \\"Butterfly.\\" \\"Mimi\\" is like a hybrid. Meaning, you get the best qualities of both.
0792833201|5.0|For whatever reason, this film is an amazing reference point in cinematic history.Whilst Tobe Hooper must have made some significant contributions to the film, I can't help but feel that the film was story-boarded by Spielberg.  In many respects, the film is finding its footing as to how it plays off the innocence of Heather, the Geekiness of the brother, the parental concerns of the \\"parents\\", and the incoming and gradually pervading malevolence of the spirits that no-one knows about.  In so many ways, the film leaves very many threads loose. And probably, this is why the film can stand up to multiple viewings. There is no resolution for many of the story elements. About the only element that is definitely resolved is how the parents treat TVs forever  after... especially in the last shot of the film.  This is one film that works on its own, but can work well with POLTERGEIST II and the discovery of one set of answers.  However, POLTERGEIST is a scare on many levels, and just works so well on tapping into primal, primaeval forces, maybe even promordial  forces, in life.    ENJOY
B000000W5F|5.0|Charlie Watts once said (and I'm paraphrasing) he has been with the Rolling Stones for 40 years but has worked about 10. Well, Tattoo You is the epitome of that quip. Over ten years of recordings mixed in with drugs, laziness, touring and debouchery produced one of the great albums of the group's catalog. There are various complaints about the album. Granted Mick Taylor got pissed about not being credited on the album. However as most Stones fans know the album has little if no, credits, and Taylor isn't the only one not getting the names placed in lights.  <br /> <br />The album is a great rock and roll set. It was Start Me Up that made me a fan forever. There are others of course: \\"Have you ever heard those opening lines..you should leave this small town way behind...\\" (TOPS). I had known of them especially during the pre-MTV days of videos like Emotional Rescue and She's so Cold shown on TV's Show SOLID GOLD (Remember that?) But this album and its hit tune did it for me. Amazingly only three years later Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA became the last great Rock and Roll album.  <br /> <br />By 1985 Rock and Roll died only to be pushed aside by a new generation and its new artform rap subsequently hip hop and the new dance music. Surely rock and roll continued in the forms of U2 and Oasis, but the Old Gods were gone from the front rows and now placed on the mantle of the respected Grandfathers of Rock. In 1986 the Stones were given the dreaded \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" award at the Grammys (given to them no less by Pete Townsend (or was it Eric Clapton? hmmmmm))and since then, music has never been the same. Listening to this album again reminds you of what rock use to be.
B000006TRV|5.0|I find myself loving individual tracks on this album more than the album itself...as a whole.  This is different for a Floyd album in that reapect.  Yes, it has a central theme clearly, but there are tracks that I just dont like at all.   <br /> <br />Here's my advice...GET A TURNTABLE and BUY SOME FLOYD LPs.  It is the only way to experience their music.  Crank up a really good stereo system, turn the lights off, and let it spin baby. (hint: Vinyl, particularly Floyd LPs, sound like heaven)
B000002UAO|5.0|This is for sure one of the greatest Beatle's albums.  One sidenote is that the CD version of this album is definately different from the original record.  The record include I've just seen a face, Norwegian Wood, You won't see me, Think for yourself, The word, Michelle, It's only love, Girl, I'm looking through you, In my life and Run for your life.  It's only love and I've just seen a face, actually appear on \\"Help!\\"  If you can get your hands on the original record then you will be able to listen to this masterpiece as The Beatles and George Martin intended.  Otherwise, get this great classic Beatle's album.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|It's amazing what you can find when you're flipping channels.  Sometimes, you strike gold and find something captivating, and sometimes you find something that's so bad you just have to watch it to see how bad it gets.  This is especially true on Saturday nights, such as yesterday.  I was cruising the movie channels, and I happened upon Van Helsing, just starting.  I'd heard that it could be a fun movie, so I decided to stay on the channel and watch it.  Over two hours later, it ended and I was wondering, \\"What was that??\\"  Hugh Jackman tries hard, and the only really bad thing about Kate Beckinsale was her accent, but otherwise, this movie was a mess.<br /><br />It's usually a bad sign when the viewer starts giving the movie the Mystery Science Theater treatment right from the very beginning, but Van Helsing just called for it.  The very first scene, detailing the classic scene from Frankenstein where the good doctor (Samuel West) is bringing his creation to life as the villagers attempt to storm the castle, is horribly overacted, mainly on Roxburgh's part as Dracula.  Then, after a thoroughly ridiculous action sequence in Paris with Van Helsing and Mr. Hyde, along with the introduction of Anna in a Transylvanian sequence, we get to the Vatican and get introduced to the best character in the movie:  Carl (David Wenham).  Carl really did make this movie for me.  His dialogue consisted of the only lines that didn't make me cringe (some of the stuff Beckinsale and Jackman have to deliver, despite their best efforts, is truly laughable).  His was the only accent that didn't sound badly done (probably because he wasn't trying to put one one).  His \\"actually, I'm only a friar\\" excuse for why he can both curse occasionally and why he can take his reward from the young lady who he saves was great.  The movie literally improved every time he was on the screen.  Especially good was the \\"Q briefs Bond\\" sequence in the Vatican's underground chamber where he's talking to Van Helsing, showing him his new weapons and his other gadgets.<br /><br />The other good thing about the movie is the cinematography.  The scenery, both natural and computer-generated, really heightened the mood of the movie.  It was beautiful, but it was also dark and moody, bringing a sense of the underlying evil layered over the village and castle.  Both castles were also magnificent, with towers reaching for the sky, bridges over vast chasms, and huge rooms to make room for all of the equipment.  It is truly a beautiful movie as far as setting is concerned.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's where the good things stop.  While most of the computer-generated scenery is first-rate, that doesn't stretch to the effects themselves.  Everything else looked like computer animation, throwing me out of the movie almost constantly during the action scenes.  The transformations from human to wolf or from vampire to flying harpy were decent, but the results of those transformations moved around like a video game rather than anything coming close to realism.  I realize effects are going to look like effects at times, as computers are not perfect.  Van Helsing just moved too far toward the fake end of the spectrum for me.  When the characters are thrown through the air, they don't bear any resemblance to human movement.<br /><br />Speaking of the action scenes, too often they contain scenes that are so far out of the realm of possibility that they threw me out of my suspension of disbelief.  Anna gets tossed high in the air, hits a wall at full force, falls at least 30 feet, and lands.  She gets up trying to shake the cobwebs out of her head from a fall that would shatter the bones of any other human.  Van Helsing has an automatic crossbow, which is a forgivable conceit.  It looks really cool.  I guess God is granting him the crossbow bolts, though, as he goes through dozens of them in one battle without ever reloading.  One funny bit was when Anna takes one of Dracula's brides to task for talking rather than just killing her, neatly turning an action movie clich&eacute; on its head.  It would mean more in a movie that wasn't committing all of the other clich&eacute;s, though.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie, however, was the dreadful acting by almost everybody involved. I've already singled out Roxburgh for the first sequence, but his acting is terrible throughout the movie.  I don't think there's a piece of scenery left on the set after he's done.  Dracula's wives do their best to out-do him, though.  They are consistently horrible.  All of their accents sound incredibly fake and forced (I don't know the actors' nationalities, but they sound fake to me).  None of the others even really reach the \\"acceptable\\" line.  Jackman and Beckinsale try their hardest, but even their acting abilities are strained by what they're given.  The dialogue is horrible all the way around (except some of Carl's).  When Dracula tries to entice Van Helsing by informing him of some of his past, I was beyond the point of caring.<br /><br />There are two reasons I'm giving this movie two stars rather than one.  The first is Carl.  The second is, despite how bad it is, it does entertain a little bit.  Once you've accepted the action sequences for what they are, they are kind of fun.  The climactic sequence is actually quite entertaining in a \\"yeah, right\\" kind of way.  Beckinsale's beautiful and Jackman (for you women out there) is hunky.  While I certainly wouldn't pay money for this monstrosity, I don't feel like I want my two hours back.  I'd settle for an hour's change back for the two that I spent.<br /><br />David Royes to task for talking rather than just killing her, neatly turning an action movie clich on its head.

0805066691|5.0|This book is, and will continue to be the authoritative thesis on the effects of the 'opening' of the American West in the late 1800s from the perspective of American Indians.<br /><br />You can not understand American history if you haven't read this book.  I know of no other book that could make this claim.  Quite simply, no one has crafted what Mr. Brown has crafted in regards to communicating the effects the opening had on Indians, including their perspective on how this effected them personally, spiritually, and culturally.  The lessons these people teach us have stayed with me for years; I try and emulate their dignity, their love for their country, and their love for each other, and easily admit their bar is set too high for me.<br /><br />This book is also a great lesson that reading history only by the  victors insures you really don't understand history at all.  A great re-affirming lesson to me.<br /><br />Besides its incredible impact on American history, its also an easy forthright read, if you don't mind crying about 20 times.  Thus, I believe it should be a reading requirement for all high schoolers, especially in this day and age when many of our churches and politicians preach and condone bigotry and hatred of the \\"other\\".
B0002IVN9W|2.0|I made the mistake of buying this when it had 2 5-star reviews and because it was recommended in association with a CD by an artist I like.  If you like accessible saturated music than you'll probably love this; I expect 80% of the 'crossover alternative' scene will think it's deep.  It has emotions and stuff.  But for me it was something that looked interesting but turned out to be as irritating and boring as being tied up and being forced to listen to coldplay.  I'm giving mine away to a friend.  The risks of being exploratory...
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Persuasion is perhaps Austen's most atmospheric novel. Her last completed novel, it is pervaded by melancholy. This film expertly captures the moods of the novel, by means of powerful performances from the leads, perfect detail and a pointed yet simple script.  <br /> <br />The heroine, Anne Elliot, is an intelligent and gentle woman, whose sense and generous spirit are slighted by her vain and vacuous family. We see that, in spite of having been persuaded not to marry a poor sailor eight years previously, her steadfast nature eventually convinces the hurt and stubborn Wentworth, now a naval officer, to rekindle the romance after many obstacles have been overcome. <br /> <br />The production values are not lavish, but seem very real. Bath, Kellynch, Lyme and Uppercross Cottage are just as the audience can imagine Austen to have envisioned them. This film is a treat.
B000001EKX|4.0|KISS's sophomore \\"Hotter Than Hell,\\" is a fine album, but one of the weaker offerings from the classic era.<br /><br />If you listened to KISS's self-titled debut album, and then listened to \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" you might conclude that \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" was a demo tape recorded years earlier. This album sounds very stuffy, as though it were recorded in a basement on an eight-track.<br /><br />KISS also run into a bit of a sophomore slump with \\"Hotter than Hell.\\" You know how it is when a band uses up all their best songs for their debut, and then they have to use the leftovers for the followup (i.e., Van Halen II). The songs on \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" are by no means bad. They're all quite good, it's just that they don't quite reach the level of greatness as the songs on the debut, or future releases. Still, this album does have some undeniable classics, like \\"Got to Choose,\\" \\"Parasite,\\" \\"Goin' Blind,\\" Watchin' You,\\" and \\"Commin' Home.\\" The rest of the songs on this disc are good, if not quite as memorable.<br /><br />One thing that really works for this album is that the band sounds young and hungry. The whole band sounds focused and energized.<br /><br />\\"Hotter Than Hell,\\" is a bit of a step back from the classic debut, but it's still a fine album and should please most KISS fans.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's catchy songs, powerful lyrics and positive vibe was everywhere in this album... guy's'll just like her for her body(why not!), but this cd is JAM PACKED with inspiration and uplifting messages!... word of caution: don't judge a song too quickly cos it's slow, eventually u'll realise how catchy and wonderful the song is... i mainly see this cd as a girl's thing, guys u can buy it for ur g/f. <BR>ONE OF MY FAV CDS!!!...
B00028HBKM|1.0|...until the sequal comes out...\\"The Passion of the Christ -- The Resurection!!\\"  I'm thinking...and Mel, go ahead and take these ideas, because, as we all are childuns of the Lord, you can religiously steal from me...we could make it a religous musical (I was disappointed that they didn't make the first one as a musical like \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\") and here's the quick storyline:  Jesus lies in state for three days, and then the Easter Bunny rolls the rock from in front of Jesus's grave, freeing him. No one has figured out the connection between the Bunny and Easter and Jesus, but this is a God-Squad project...these followers will believe ANYTHING we push at them (and make sure we ask for 15% more tithe in the collection on opening week). (Note for the Hispanic version:  If we pronouce Jesus as \\"hezus\\", we'll make big bucks from the Latin/South American market and the transplanted Latin/South Americans who lost the property that they stole from the citizens, once their favorite government was overthrown and they had to flee for their lives..but I digress) so Jesus is saved and resurrected by the Easter Bunny, but Jesus is hungry, so miraculously, he produces eggs...hard-boiled eggs --but there is no heat, how did he cook them it's a miracle!!--and they are multi-colored, blessed with multi-hues by God himself!!!  And Jesus gives out baskets..woven straw baskets, there were only three but they miraculously duplicated themselves...he gives out baskets and commands his followers to go out and hunt more multi-colored eggs to feed themselves. His followers are estactic..they make and weave multi-colored hats, or \\"bonnets\\", to honor Him as they hunt for the \\"Easter eggs\\".  Of course this is a Mel Gibson film, and while the first film was woefully deficient, the second film will involve a high-speed chase between Jesus and the Devil in pimped-out Porsches thru the LA streets...at night, on the rain-swept streets, like a \\"Miami Vice\\" thing...with some pumping music by some popular nu-metal band like Linkin Park (but they are so \\"yesterday\\", we need somebody more exciting) and of course, as with all Mel films, we need explosions explosions EXPLOSIONS big time....and in the end, Jesus gets the girl (Carmen Electra would be good) but he says NO, he has a job to do, the risks are too great (see Spiderman script) and \\"we can never be together, I have a Holy Duty to perform\\", so he speeds off into the sunset/distance on his skates...that's right, he's a Holy Roller.  THE END...it's gonna be boffo box office, and I'm waiting so I can get the collector's DVD box set before I spend any money on this one.
B00006LWSF|4.0|The movie was better but the soundtrack was still hot. Includes \\"Lose Yourself\\" and \\"Wanksta\\", among other classic cuts. Whether or not you like rap, you'll love the soundtrack of this movie. <br /> <br />1. Eminem - Lose Yourself - you've all heard this 1000's of times. 9/10 <br />2. Eminem feat. Obie Trice & 50 Cent - Love Me - classic Eminem song featuring his two solo protoges. I love Obie's album \\"Cheers\\" and am awaiting his second album. 10/10 <br />3. Eminem - 8 Mile - another classic Eminem song. you most likely heard this on the radio; should have released a video for this. 10/10 <br />4. Obie Trice - Adrenaline Rush - I love Obie Trice (even more than 50 Cent, esp. after the disappointment of The Massacre) and this is one of his best songs. My favorite song on this whole soundtrack. 10/10 <br />5. 50 Cent - Places to Go - hot song that I think shoulda been a bonus cut on Get Rich or Die Tryin'. 9.5/10 <br />6. D-12 feat. 50 Cent - Rap Game - beat and song are annoying as f**k; the 50 Cent hook and Eminem verse saved this in a major way. 5/10 <br />7. Jay-Z feat. Freeway - 8 Miles and Running - like Jay-Z, hate Freeway; gotta be in the mood to play this. 5/10 <br />8. Xzibit - Spit Shine - found out about X-to-the-Z through Pimp My Ride and picked up Weapons of Mass Destruction and 2002's Man and Machine. I then wanted to play this soundtrack again recently and noticed he was on the song. Hated it at that time, but now is one of my favorite songs!!! 10/10 <br />9. Macy Gray - Time of Your Life - I had the worst of this hearing this song. 1/10 <br />10. Nas - U Wanna Be Me - not his greatest song; I've heard MUCH better from this dude. 6/10  <br />11. 50 Cent - Wanksta - second video from the soundtrack and first from his debut \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\"; u most likely heard this joint. 9/10 <br />12. Boomkat - Wasting My Time - exactly what I did listening to this song. 1/10 <br />13. Rakim - R.A.K.I.M. - he kills it on this song. Definitely worth a listen. 10/10 <br />14. Young Zee - That's My N---- Fo Real - not a great song; his freestyle on D-12 World was MUCH, and I mean MUCH better. 6.5/10 <br />15. Gang Starr - Battle - heard much better from this dude. 4/10 <br />16. Eminem - Rabbit Run - an Eminem song with no hook; that's about it. 8/10

B0007YVBFC|5.0|I have been a Mariah fan since she came out and  i have to say this is the best we seen from miss MC. The cd is a upbeat r&b cd that will make you say \\"Beyonce who?\\". She also has some ballads that will still blow you away. \\"We belong together\\" is such a great ballad. Vocally and lyrically. I also recommend the track JoyRide(number 13). This is such a great ballad. It was done by a 16 year old boy. How amazing. Then there is \\"Fly Like A bird\\" which goes back to church. The lord is praised in this amazing track full of high notes and a choir to die for. Over all the cd is amazing. It fits every mood you have. Happy, sad, and club going. So pick it up if you dont have it already cause Mariah is back and on fire baby.

B00003XB8K|2.0|MCMMLVIIICIXVIX was 5 stars, cross of changes was 3 at best, le roi was 4-maybe 4.5 stars, but this one sucks.  The sampling of Verdi or whoever it was is popularizing and stinkifying to high hell some incredibly gorgeous operatic music.  It's shameful, and Cretu maybe should be castrated--oh, wait, He must be to hit those feminine notes he does.  The female vocalist (not Cretu) is the only good singing on this record.  The voice of Cretu is as usual saturated in reverb and delay, which really crapifies the sound, and makes it seem like he was desperate to somehow make this feeble attempt at music sound good.  There are some good melodies here and there, but they are too broken up by garbage that the album as a whole is unlistenable and annoying.  Enigma's strength is melody and weaving it into an album length song-experience, and this one entirely fails.  The artwork seems to reflect the music too--choose an album based on the picture--it's about right.
0553296981|5.0|This story is incredible.  It really shows you what a human being is capable of.  Even in such conditions, Frank's family constructed an environment designed to foster growth.  And further, Frank's last diary entries are stunning in their depth.  She realized things that it takes others decades or more to learn, if ever.  This story is one of the many lights of our human heritage.  If you haven't read it with the maturity of an adult, there's no time like the present.
630542828X|1.0|Don't bother wasting your time with this movie, instead read the book.  The book was one of the best I have ever read, the movie left me wanting.  I rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through.  So maybe I am being unfair since I did not watch the whole movie, but honestly I couldn't, it just didn't do the story justice.  For a book that was captiviating they sure made the movie boring, if the movie industry is in this to make money, they should have tracked the book more closely.
B00003XB8K|4.0|I love Enigma. I really love Enigma. \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\" is another great offering from this tight, creative ensemble. Whenever I want to kick it and calm down (which I need to do because I do get easily worked up my friends say) I put on an Enigma disc and fly.  I don't know why it took me so long to get around to this one but I was not let down. I especially connect with \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" and \\"Gravity Of Love\\". And I have to say, I really love the artwork on their covers. The visuals put me in in the mood for the aural experience.  <br /> <br />One big complaint: This CD is way to short!!!!!
B00003000M|5.0|A lot people begin their review of this album by saying, \\"I've been listening to Bob Marley for a long time, and this album sucks....\\" Blah, Blah, Blah.  I've been listening to Bob Marley for a long time too.  And anyone who has a drop of sense in their heads and a splash of open-mindedness will embrace this album.  Sure its not Bob Marley pure and spiritual.  But its a tribute, and its done well.  It employs musicians from different genres who probably have been influenced by the Great One.  Saying this album sucks because Aerosmith rocks out to Bob Marley is like saying a Christian cannot read the Koran.  Come on people, open up your minds.  Do I hear fiiiiive stars????
B000002GFC|5.0|Cream got it all right with their \\"best of\\" Compilation, which features 20 of their best hits at a reasonable price. I myself just got into Cream music through first hearing the bass controlled Sunshine Of Your Love and falling in love with it. In order to pursue my potential interest for the band, I wanted an album, but felt it necessary to become more accustomed to their music. Therefore, I downloaded several Cream tracks and liked them all. Recently finding out that Disraeli Gears is supposedly the essential Cream album, I went to check out some prices at a music store. My option was to pay 2 dollars more for the Best Of compilation which featured 20 songs, a number of them being already on the Disraeli Gears album, or buy the 11 track album, Disraeli Gears. Despite how classic a rock album it is, I let common sense get the better of me and bought the Very Best Of Cream.<br /><br />To review this compilation, I would have to say it hits its stride once we reach N.S.U., a lyric shouter which flows together very nicely as a whole. That doesn't mean to say that Sweet Wine and Wrapping Paper aren't great songs though. I love the jump into I'm So Glad, and then as we continue, we get into more of the classic Cream hits that made them ever so popular. Swlabr is a huge highlight to this compilation, as is the smooth tendencies of I Feel Free. As with many discs, the first half stays consistent with song collection and the disc very much seperates itself in half, the first half focusing primarily on some of the more heavier sides of Cream, with controlled riffs. The second half features essentials like White Room and Strange Brew. Politician is art, with a heavier insight and noisier. We're Going Wrong is a softer, more melodic track, and then of course we have the blues based tracks, Spoonful, Sitting On Top Of The World and Born Under a Bad Sign, two of them being  covers interpreted quite differently on the lyrical standpoint with small changes made. Badge seemse to close the album out nicely, and with a glorious piano accompaniement, and the changes of pace.<br /><br />All in all, this a great compilation. Some people feel ashamed to buy Best Of's and Greatest Hits compilation, thinking they're not a true fan by doing so. I on the contrary, see it as a wonderful opportunity to explore the works of a particular artist or bands who you're not as familiar with as you wish you were. So please buy this compilation if you're a casual fan, someone who has an interest for 60s rock, or are just another Cream fan who's looking for all of their great hits on one affordable Disc. You won't regret your purchase, I guarentee it.album out nicely, and with a glorious piano accompaniement, and the changes of pace.    All in all, this a great compilation.

B00028HBKM|1.0|why would mel gibson make a movie that would promote alot of controversy? hmm, do you think maybe it might be because ALOT OF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO SEE IT THEN? i cant believe mel made this movie in honor of god, because if he did then he would of at least made it about an interesting story with a good plot and character development... <br /> <br />i agree with the guy who said there should be a sequel. but instead of making jesus a race car driver let him come back from heaven decked out in all sorts of crazy gun crap like rambo. \\"Jesus is back, and he is pissed\\", follow jesus as he goes back in time to save john conner from the evil robots, and then when thats done jesus will master the magic dragon and go save the elven maidens on mount gundor! we can make it a coming of age story about how jesus is still learning about emotional development or something stupid like that, and in the end can become a pirate and sail into the sunset with a eye patch and pegged leg, or we could just crucify him again, and make sure the nails stay in place
0385510454|2.0|Where were Grisham's editors? Inconsistencies--both in character's actions and in logic--destroy any chance of suspense or the reader feeling any genuine interest in what's happening in this non-starter. Neither suspense, nor mystery, nor thriller, The Broker is simply a dressed up travelogue, sprinkled with superficial language, fashion, and geographic touches. Grisham's prose is flat and workmanlike in this outing, making one yearn for even the least inspired James Lee Burke effort. Give this one a miss.

B0000C1733|5.0|When I first got this CD in December of 2003 I literally played it non stop for most of 2004. I can see why some hardcore fans would be disappointed with the absence of it's more funkier EMI stints (keep in mind even though Higher Ground from the 1989 album Mother's Milk made it on to here it is still a Warner Brothers release so any other songs made during their EMI days would not be on here, you can go to What Hits!? from 1992 for that). I am a hardcore fan, yet I am still not disappointed by this collection.  From the raging pounding funk of Give It Away from it's 1991 breakthrough Blood Sugar Sex Magik to their newer funk-punk sound of Fortune Faded and Save The Population, this greatest hits album best displays the diversity in their sound over the years and it goes to show that there is not a better, more creative, and more vibrant band than the everlasting Red Hot Chili Peppers.

B000051YDH|2.0|To paraphrase, speeds overall too fast. Ozawa's earlier 1969 Boston Symphony Version on RCA-BMG FAR preferable.
B0007OASII|5.0|......since Kamelot's last release, _Epica_. And so that indisputably makes it the best power metal album to date. For Kamelot to elevate and perfect a genre that is usually so poorly represented might seem a lesser feat than to do so where one's peers are strong. Yet the absorbing nature of _The Black Halo_ and its predecessor _Epica_ should be never be considered a mean accomplishments. These are some of the best, most consumingly listenable albums out there, along with output of such bands as Pineforest Crunch, Thinking Plague, the Beatles, Spock's, and Meshuggah.<br /><br />In terms of music, everything that was said about _Epica_ can be said about _The Black Halo_. This is fitting as they are two halves of the _Faust_-inspired Epica_ concept. The only really important differences are that the music is heavier (guitars are more up in the mix, lots of tasty crunch) and even _more_ melodic (much to my surprise, they outdid themselves again). Kamelot's art of orchestrating tension-filled verses into huge, sweeping choruses and azz-kicking riffs and little symphonic bitties has apparently tapped into an endless well of inspiration.<br /><br />All of the songs are completely great. Kamelot changes gears and opens the album not with a high-speed, but a rather dark, mid-tempo \\"March of Mephisto\\", twistingly melodic riffs and Shaggrath from Dimmu Borgir as Mephisto, backing Khan on the chorus. Then they dish out \\"When the Lights Are Down\\" with blazing double-bass pedals and driving, crunchy riffs. It pretty much switches between mid- and fast-tempi throughout (and soft interludes in most songs), split in the middle with \\"Abandoned\\", a piano-based ballad with Khan's pure singing (awe-inspiring, really), and Mari singing as Helena as the music begins to swell on crests of strings and heavy drums. There are interludes, through though fewer than the previous disc, including some interesting moments which add nice touches of variety, like an atmospheric cabaret and a brief vocal solo from Khan. The album builds all builds to a ridiculously high level and then goes right over the top with \\"Momento Mori\\", Kamelot hugest, best song to date. Perhaps the best part of Kamelot's _Epica_ story is that each album's finale song (\\"Three Ways to Epica\\" and \\"Momento Mori\\") are the best, most intense finale songs with the best choruses ever in power metal. Why do other power metal bands even exist? Kamelot wipes the floor with all of them. Sad but true. The story ends and \\"Serenade\\" provides an epilogue much like \\"The Center of the Universe\\" is a prologue. \\"Serenade\\"'s glistening riff and yet another soaring (but somber) chorus ends the album perfectly. The story of _The Black Halo_ begins with Ariel still mourning Helena and under Mephisto's power. As it goes on he learns that Mephisto is merely a part of himself, and that the choice between paths of righteousness and of evil is his alone. In the end he comes to peace with himself, then he dies. By the way, i'm probably just a fanboy. You might be better served by someone more objective.<br /><br />a note about editions: this review is one the amazon page for the normal johnny edition. A boring, ghetto-plastic jewel case and no bonus tracks. there is another domestic special edition (probably out of print now), packaged in a bright, sleek digipak with two bonus tracks (radio edits of \\"March of Mephisto\\" and \\"The Haunting\\"). I think it might have a music video on it too. The BEST EDITION TO GET would be the Japanese one, because it has a bonus track that is _not_ a radio edit, \\"Epilogue\\"). It's an awesome song and a big crazy Kamelot fan with only be satisfied if they have the edition it is on.ef vocal solo from Khan. The album builds all builds to a ridiculously high level and then goes right over the top with \\"Momento Mori\\", Kamelot hugest, best song to date. Perhaps the best part of Kamelot's _Epica_ story is that each album's finale song (\\"Three Ways to Epica\\" and \\"Momento Mori\\") are the best, most intense finale songs with the best choruses ever in power metal. Why do other power metal bands even exist? Kamelot wipes the floor with all of them. Sad but true. The story ends and \\"Serenade\\" provides an epilogue much like \\"The Center of the Universe\\" is a prologue. \\"Serenade\\"'s glistening riff and yet another soaring (but somber) chorus ends the album perfectly. The story of _The Black Halo_ begins with Ariel still mourning Helena and under Mephisto's power. As it goes on he learns that Mephisto is merely a part of himself, and that the choice between paths of righteousness and of evil is his alone. In the end he comes to peace with himself, then he dies. By the way, i'm probably just a fanboy. You might be better served by someone more objective. <br /> <br />a note about editions: this review is one the amazon page for the normal johnny edition. A boring, ghetto-plastic jewel case and no bonus tracks. there is another domestic special edition (probably out of print now), packaged in a bright, sleek digipak with two bonus tracks (radio edits of \\"March of Mephisto\\" and \\"The Haunting\\"). I think it might have a music video on it too. The BEST EDITION TO GET would be the Japanese one, because it has a bonus track that is _not_ a radio edit, \\"Epilogue\\"). It's an awesome song and a big crazy Kamelot fan with only be satisfied if they have the edition it is on.
B0007GAERG|5.0|After getting this album, I'd like to 'Say Somethin''. If you are after great music, great voice and great enjoyment, stop running around in 'Circles', the 'One And Only' Mariah (aka Mimi) is 'Your Girl'. To all old/new/ex-Mimi fans out there, 'I wish You Knew' that 'We Belong Together'. Don't you like the 'Joy Ride' she takes us through her albums? 'It's Like That', her music makes us 'Fly Like A Bird'. We rush 'To The Floor' and dance. When we get sad, we 'Shake It Off' by listening to her music. When our bf / gf refuses to 'Stay The Night', her music will. Is she your star, she is definitely 'Mine Again'. 'Get Your Number' One album now!

B0007GAERG|5.0|She's back!!!!!!!!Yes, the talented, the one, the only, the emancipated Mariah Carey has returned to reclaim her throne as \\"the voice\\" for music today. Although I have to admit that I was apprehensive of buying the album due to the unsavory reviews of her past albums like Charmbracelet and Glitter something within me told me buy this album and I was so glad I did. It was worth every penny, dime and dollar!! I was very pleased with the work that was executed on this album. Mariah has truly left the me speechless. I have to say it has been a long time, since I can actually listen to a whole album without skipping other songs.  All of Mariah's songs in the emancipation of MIMI album are unique, different, and convey her sadness, joy, and peace she has finally found. The emancipation of Mimi not only emancipates Mariah, it emancipates the public with the current distasteful sounds of todays modern artists that we the public must suffer to hear. Move over Beyonce,Britney,  Christina, J-Lo, Alicia, and especially Ashanti & Ashley Simpson!! Ms. Carey has returned to show how a real artist performs and sings her songs. No, I am not a hater of the aforementioned artists I actually like most of their work. However, their voices cannot hold a candle to Mariah's. In this album the voice of Mariah is what an music artist is supposed to accomplish to move the audience within their entire being by using the instrument of their voice. What seperates Mariah from the current artists is that she can truly sing and does not need the support of music to hide any flaws. emancipation of mimi if anything states her point that an artist a music artist is one who not only writes their music and words on the manuscript of their song but also can use their voice as instrument to convey the emotions of the human heart. Back to the album although there are many instances where you see the Mariah of the early 90's, you also see a glimpses of the modern artist that is Mariah of today. All in all Igive this album a 5/5. Word of Advice to fellow readers and listeners: Amazon advertises to buy J-Lo's rebirth album with the emancipation of mimi, I actually have the \\"Rebirth\\" album and unlike most critics found that the album was great! The only problem is try not listen to the strong voice of Mariah first and then listen to Jennifers \\"Rebirth\\" you will really hear the vocal difference and range of a singer to a well... you make the call. The thing is you will feel cheated! I had some of my coworkers listen to Mariah's album first and then Jennifer's and they told me that they could not take J-Lo's Reirth album and quickly gave it away. Any how, here is what I rate the best songs of the \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\":  <br /> <br />1)It's Like that: Great song to come out with as the first single it keeps you moving and anticipating what the rest of the album will sound like. 5/5 <br /> <br />2)We belong together: Her first ballad of the album is very R&B'is and demonstrates Mariah's heartbreak over failing loves. Mariah's voice starts of strong in the album with this song and the strength of her voice, the heartache of her fleeing lover can be heard. 5/5 <br /> <br />3)Shake it off: This song is average. Nice, sweet and is the first song on the album that conveys her infamous high soprano tones. 4/5 <br /> <br />4)Mine again: Love ballad. This song is absolutely amaxzing both lyrically and musically the horns and instruments played in the album along with Mariah's album allow the listener to get into the mood of loving. This song is reminiscent to her early 90's works ut better. 5/5 <br /> <br />5)Say something: this song features Snoop Dogg and if you like cry baby on the last then you will surely like this one. Pharrell provides the background vocals to this song and the lyrics are amazing!! 5/5 <br /> <br />6) Stay the night: Another ballad Catchy and nice but slows the tempo of the album which I think was masterfully done because it arouses your curisoty of what comes next. 4/5 <br /> <br />7)Get your number: Mostly a pop club song. Not my favoriet song on the album not really feeling the rap. 2/5 <br /> <br />8)One and Only: Mariah's vocals are really nice here but I think she should have used a different rapper for the song. Although I love Twista I think 50 cents and the entire G- unit crew or Jadakiss shoudld have featured in the album, but it was nonetheless a great song. 4/5 <br /> <br />9) Circles: Again another great ballad by Mariah her voice was the bomb and the lyrics and background vocals were great 5/5.  <br /> <br />10)Your girl: A pleasant song at first the beginning music reminds you of \\"one and only\\" track however Mariah surprises you with her voice. The beats are very soulful. This song although short is very pleasant and sweet and very R&Bish. If you are not a R&B lover than this song is not for you. This song also starts of the strength of the rest of the songs of the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />11)I wish you knew: Loved this song!! five of my top songs of the album!! the old Mariah comes back with this song had to give it a 5/5 <br /> <br />12)To the floor: This song features Nelly and is very weird. The music also sets a different tone in the album. 3/5 <br /> <br />13) Joy Ride: My favorite song of the album. Mariah's infamous high strung sopranos cover this song and she uses them carefully and executes them with sophistication. The backgorund voices are strong and give weight to the song. The music very catchy is very modern R&B. 5/5 <br /> <br />14) Fly Like a Bird: Great inspritation song and is my second song of the album. In then end Mariah tells you to lift your spirists to be the best you can be and this song is reminicent to the wonderfyl \\"Hero\\" of the Drealover album, although entirely different in its own way. 5/5
6300214419|5.0|There is a romantic glow to this very undervalued film. It is a throwback to films of the 40's and 50's. Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep give old style performances to match the story's atmosphere, which is sweet and sentimental. It does not make light of the subject matter of having an affair but instead is a film about finding love itself. In keeping with that theme, the romantic feelings of the two leads are never allowed to reach their natural conclusion. The love that gently blossoms is one of the heart.<br /><br />Frank Raftis (DeNiro) and Molly Gilmore (Streep) are going about their mundane and uninspiring lives amidst the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season in New York when they literally run into each other at a bookshop. Both are married and when they meet again on the train to work, a friendship begins. Even the small prospect of riding to work together is handled gingerly as both are good people who would not want to hurt their spouses.<br /><br />As they become more dependent on each other the moral dilema escalates. There are charming scenes as each almost misses the train, and the chance to talk. Her father is sick and Molly's response is to call Frank. It is the little things that separate this film from others. Frank and Molly fall in love for the reason we all do; because of how we feel about ourselves when we are with that person.<br /><br />When they finally can not stand it anymore they have a clumsy and aborted attempt at making love. Both DeNiro and Streep are wonderful at capturing the moral dilema of two people already married who have found the love of their life. Dianne Wiest has a nice turn as Molly's best friend Isabelle and Harvey Keitel as DeNiro's pal Ed is engaging. Jane Kaczmarek, of television's Malcolm in the Middle fame, gives a nice performance as Franks's wife Ann.<br /><br />This film begins at Christmas and ends at Christmas a year later. It is a sweet and charming film about falling in love and finding happiness. Dave Grusin helps the atmosphere with a nice score that perfectly captures the sweet exhilaration and anguish of Frank and Molly's love. If you enjoy films that deal with love instead of lust, then chances are you'll fall in love with this one. It's a very nice film to own..

B000092T6M|3.0|Alan Rickman. And the entire 3 stars in my rating go to him. I just actually saw this movie for the first time the other day, and he completely blew me away, he looked like he was having the time of his life playing the Sheriff. I agree with everyone who says he stole the movie. I loved how he just camped it up, he was almost going quite Python-esque in some scenes, just with his little mannerisms and quirks. I understand the director gave him free reign to play with the character however he wanted, and we should all be thankful for that! The movie on the whole would suck if he wasn't in it!
B000001OAA|3.0|this cd was just that...ok.i like garbage,but this was not the best.the only song really standing out is only happy when it rains.so...if ur a huge garbage fan or u like pop buy this.if ur expecting their great new single why do u love me,dont.
B0007GAERG|5.0|To the idiots giving this disc 1 star reviews when clearly you have not listened to the disc - STOP IT.  We get that you don't like Mariah or her style of music so GET A LIFE and use your precious life moments to do something else besides bring down the rating of what is definitely one of the best r&b/pop albums released thus far this year. <br /> <br />Mariah is clearly happy and in control of her music and seems to enjoy being Mariah again.  Her performances on both BET's Blueprint and VH1's Save The Music were awesome and no one can claim that she has totally lost her voice.   <br /> <br />I feel really sorry for her early 90's fans who feel soooo betrayed by her change to a more r&b format but artists change and grow (Thank God) - if Mariah had not been able to do the kind of music she enjoys she would have stagnated and her so-called fans would have left her, just like Celine Dion & Whitney Houston \\"fans\\" who complain about the sameness of their newer releases (proving that some singers can't win for losing - if they change or stay the same, people will always complain). <br /> <br />Again, this is one of the best albums out now, it has a good balance of dance tracks and ballads (the ballads: We Belong Together, Mine Again, If You Only Knew should appease her 90's craving Mariah fans).  I haven't enjoyed a Mariah disc right off the bat like this since 'Butterfly'.  If radio is fair, she can have at least 5+ solid hits: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Fly Like a Bird, Stay The Night, If You Only Knew...(again, this is a really terrific album). <br /> <br />I hope that most people who read Amazon reviews truly read between the lines of the negative reviews to see that probably 90% of these people DID NOT BUY OR LISTEN TO the disc. <br /> <br />Congratulations Mariah - job well done!
B00005JKL8|3.0|I liked the last action scene, when the lead character was finally rescued. It's one of the only few good things about the movie -- another being that much of the movie was shot beautifully. The shots on the deck of the aircraft carrier and of Owen Wilson on the top of a small hill were eye-pleasing. <br /> <br />But the director seemed determined to trump character developments by his visual styles, maybe being afraid that too much of the former would have diluted the latter. The \\"killer\\" was virtually portrayed as a cardboard monster whose only goal in life was to kill and hate. The movie also felt kind of choppy, being more of a series of separate scenes rather than a smooth development of plot. The screenplay was weak as well: perfunctory and thin.  <br /> <br />Over all, if you are looking for a piece of junk entertainment (filled with hokey and unsophisticated stuff) for a mindless Saturday night, you might have found a winner right here.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This is the first time I have been crazy for a show since Fastlane...ah,memories (good thing I taped that show). But I want this one on DVD! My mom even watches it!!! She's a Law and Order fanatic. I've missed a few episodes of this show, and when I finally got to watch it again...all I have to say is I'm kickin myself for missing those episodes. I just keep thinking 'when did all this happen?'. Watch it, love it, when it comes out buy it.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|After reading close to most of these reviews it has become clear that most of you, not all. But most are probably into electronic music just for the scene and not because you enjoy the music. <br /> <br />Some of you have gone crazy reviewing this album as if Daft Punk did \\"you\\" wrong. When they were simply doing what they do best experimenting. Before any of you go reviewing this Album as \\"The Worst Daft Punk Album EVER!\\" Please check out everything that they have to offer including DVD's and Thomas Bangalters Roul label. Then listen to Homework and Discovery one more time and tell me there is not repetitiveness already in these two albums but maybe because your mind is just all wrapped up in the wacky synth effects and vocoders you can't actually pick them. <br /> <br />To sum it all up Daft Punk are different and repetitive. Don't listen to Human After All expecting classy happy beats like you're favorite album, Discovery.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This is above and beyond, even for Dylan.  This record is an amazing testament to the the oceanic potency of this great master story-teller.  This is an essential recording by a superlative artist and is malleable enough to suit the taste of any collecter regardless of genre preference.  It's just that timeless, it's just that good.
B000059XUP|3.0|Pros: <br />1. Fresh and new orientation of LOVE element (A love of a father for his son) <br />2. Very very dark feeling, sometimes to dark to my stomach. <br />3. Interesting role for the woman that found the Crow. <br /> <br />Cons (Too many of them to list'em all): <br />1. Annoying music after the first 20 - 25 minutes. <br />2. Lame pursuit and \\"making justice\\" sequences (except one.. you'll know which is it). <br />3. Not much action, just rock & roll, drugs, alcohol, party party and more parties. <br />4. Good performance from the \\"good guys\\" actors, lame one from the \\"bad guys\\" (especially from the BIG bad one). <br /> <br />Recommendation: Buy it only if you're a die hard crow series fan. <br />
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah's \\"Music Box\\" album alone has sold almost 30 million copies Worldwide. the power ballad \\"Hero\\" continues to touch many people to believe in yourself and Dreamlover was an uptempo #1 hit..Other songs that are really good are All I've Ever Wanted and Endless Love, and the whole album...lol
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Seems like there's two sets of fans of Daft Punk. Ones who loved their Homework album, which was more club oriented floor fillers. And ones who loved their second album, which was a pop album. Human After All seems to fall right in between, not too underground and not pop enough. I am a fan of their Homework album and was hoping to hear some of that. I'm also a DJ who plays One More Time at almost every Barmitzvah I do. After barely able to listen through the whole album, I can honestly say \\"Human After All\\" will not get any play in any format. It's boring and emotionless. Can you say REMIX.
B000002AVF|5.0|This album like Mariah's new album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is hot from start to finish. Daydream marked a new era in music as Mariah and ODB teamed up on the Fantasy Remix..Mariah's influence can be seen today very much..This is an all time classic album and was Mariah's biggest seller in the US.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Although there may be some clever placement of factual content in order to steer the viewer in one direction, Michael Moore still covers all the facts. <br /> <br />It might not be the exact truth, but it sure makes you stop and think about all the events....
B0000062GE|5.0|This album means so much to me...you wouldn't believe.  When I first picked up this CD, I was at the absolute lowest point in my life.  Every song on this CD was an almost exact reflection of what I was going through at the time.  At the time that I bought this CD, I knew next to nothing of Stabbing Westward or their music.  I was looking for something new to listen to, and it was really cheap.  I've never regreted that purchase.  If you're at a really low point in your life, pick up this CD...it will be like having a friend who understands everything that you are going through...because they've been there.
B00004VXF2|3.0|OK, I don't own this album. I just listened to the samples, because I've heard stories of pure feedback on a CD. Well, I was quite shocked. But it's not that horrible. I don't know why, but I kind of like it. Maybe I'll buy it. But I have to ask: \\"Lou Reed..WTF!\\"
B0000X61VE|5.0|This is my second copy of \\"Shape your body\\" workout, the first one was VHS and I'm absolutely delighted it finally came out on DVD.  I purchased both Tamilee Webb's \\"I want that body\\" and Cindy's dvd, and it only proved to me once again how much I love her workout. Whereas Tamilee does work your buns off, Cindy's is actually both fun and effective! It works all the parts of your body, keeps your interest piqued and is performed both indoors and outdoors which breaks the usual monotony of exercise videos. Besides Cindy is a pleasure to look at, she just looks strong and toned and not like a stringy walking muscle which a lot of the fitness instructors suffer from. She performs the whole workout alongside you and you can see her sweating and breathing hard and it's kind of encouraging in an odd way. The effects are amazing - I am not a slouch, but I still have to rest a lot in between the sets if just to catch my breath. You shape up really fast with this one!
B00006CXXU|5.0|How can a singer sound so perfect, great cd, great songs the best being Cruz. This is one of the best CD'S out there.
B0007GAERG|4.0|This is sold return for Mariah, although many of the songs take a while to catch up. <br /> <br />Rating of vocals - 4/5: <br />Vocally, this is not quite \\"the return of the voice\\".  For a long time it has been clear that Mariah is not vocally as impressive as she was on her debut album, where in performances such as \\"vision of love\\", \\"vanishing\\" she rivalled Whitney Houston. However, this album is vocally still superior to Mariah's current rivals, and there art parts of the songs (Circles, the end of joy ride, where she sings with a thicker tone to end the song) which show a return to the quality of her thicker voice of \\"Music Box\\". It's hard to know whether Mariah sings with the thinner voice merely out of choice or for lack of ability - her 2001 Superbowl rendition of \\"Spar Spangled Banner\\" showed she could then belt out thick notes.  However, it is at least clear that Mariah's ability to transitions through registers has deteriorated - she can't do it quite as smoothl as displayed in earlier works such as \\"your so cold\\" (from Emotions), and also her fuller-voiced undulations in \\"visino of love\\" and \\"vanishing\\" (from Debut).  <br /> <br />Songs - 4/5: <br /> <br />Highlights include the certain number 1 \\"get your number\\" and the less commercial \\"circles\\" and \\"joy ride\\".  Only the duet with Snoop Dogg is really dull.  \\"We belong Together\\" is sort of disappointing second release, being a rather bland ballad.  Some of amazon readers are comparing this song to \\"vision of love\\", but they are not really in the same league, and listening to the 2 songs side by side really highlights how superior Mariah's voice was on her debut albu, (the final chorus in vision of love was truly extraordinary). I can't see \\"We belong together\\" being more than a top 20 hit, which makes it a shame that it's her second release, and has the potential of underminning the momentum of the album's No 1 debut release - to the floor, or get my number would have been commercial better releases. <br/> <br />Overall: 4/5 <br /> <br />This is her most consistent album since her debut, however, it doesn't have the classics that Music Box and Daydream had so it would probably rank as her 4th best album. It is certainly stronger than all her releases since Butterfly <br /> <br />Is this a true comeback? <br /> <br />The album will probably need to reach 3 platimun to be classed as a comeback, and 5 platimun as a return to being one of the world's biggest. I imagine it will be about a 2-3 platimun album, particularly, if \\"we belong together\\" suggests Mariah will release the wrong singles. \\"emancipation...\\" won't match the success of either her debut, Music Box or Daydream, as it lacks the clear standout number 1's like the aforementioned albums (which collectively had 9 No1's). Mariah could benefit though because of the lack of rival divals currently (particularly, with Whitney gone, Mariah's is without a top rival vocalist) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000099T2L|2.0|There was a point in time when I was a Beyonce fanatic. Posters plastered on my walls, Destiny's Child albums scattered about the room, and I couldn't wait until her first solo effort was to be released. That is, until I bought the album.  I purchased the CD the first day it was sold in stores, despite the fact that the single \\"Crazy in Love,\\" didn't impress me too much. One spin in my stereo and one look through the credits inside of the CD and I was convinced. Beyonce was nothing more than a commercial rip off and I was just a foolish consumer who had fallen into the pit known as music marketing.  To my disgusted amazement, I discovered that eight of the fifteen tracks either sampled songs form the past or were written by someone else. All Beyonce' did was take songs from the past that weren't well known to mainstream music listeners, and sit down with a group of writers to come up with clich, predictable, inarticulately written, lyrics. The song I liked most which was \\"Be With You,\\" sampled several different songs for both the music AND the lyrics.  Yes, Beyonce is beautiful, and yes her voice is just as impressive, but her music is nothing more than overly synthesized, re-edited, poorly written tracks stolen from past musicians and groups. The lyrics alone turned me against the singer, who ranted about \\"Baby boy, you stay on my mind/ Baby boy, you are so damn fine,\\" and mutilated the already clich rhyming of the words crazy and baby in \\"Crazy in Love.\\" Then to top it off she threw \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" on the CD and gave her album the same title as if no one was aware that it was the same song from the Destiny's Child album \\"Survivor,\\" with a few piano keys added.  Beyonce has the talent--VOCALLY, but as a songwriter it would be best if she left that to professionals. I am personally surprised and appalled that she won so many Grammy's for this album. I at least hoped that the music industry would be able to recognize real music when they heard it, but apparently they're as reliable as the masses that have purchased this so called \\"brilliant\\" album.  The music is bland, the lyrics are jumbled and easily forgotten, and there is no depth to the record at all. Songs like \\"Hip-Hop Star,\\" and \\"Signs,\\" will make you scratch your head and wonder how such nice beats could compell such sorry lyrics. The songs like \\"The Closer I Get to You,\\" and \\"Naughty Girl,\\" seem to drag on for hours on end, while pointless songs such as \\"Gift from Virgo,\\" and \\"Daddy,\\" will just plain annoy you as you listen to her try to fit 5,094,091 words into what seems to be, ten seconds of music.  If mainstream music with no meaning or purpose is your cup of tea, you should most certainly purchase this album. It will be around an hour of Beyonce failing attempts to sing in a Mariah Carey style, as she rushes words and repeats clich's as best she can, and you will LOVE it. If you like originality and true songwriters/musicians, you'd be smart to steer clear of this album. As the title states, it is dangerous.
0788821075|5.0|I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews to this movie. It's a fairy tale; the rules of the real world don't apply. But moreover, I've never agreed with some of the things said. I wanted to respond to some of the claims of those reviews: largely, the statements that this movie glorifies prostitution, and that it teaches you that money is self-respect. <br /> <br />Maybe the movie was supposed to be a cynical echo of those thoughts, but it certainly didn't turn out that way. Glorifies prostitution? Roberts' character, Vivien, is attacked by Edward's slick lawyer when he finds out what her job is. She tells Edward that it isn't something anyone dreams of doing, but she couldn't make rent, and the first time she did it she \\"cried the whole time.\\" Vivien's friend, Kit, couldn't pick up the money Vivien left for her at first, because she had to hide from Carlos. Need symbolism? As a hooker, Vivien wore a short, platinum blonde wig: when she took off the wig, she pointed to her hair and said \\"Red.\\" Edward said \\"Better.\\" <br /> <br />As to the money - the fact that that Edward told salespersons to suck up to Vivien while she waved his credit card at them - well. As Edward says in the movie, he and Vivien are very alike: they \\"both screw people for money.\\" Money is how they work and how they think; it's how they relate to people. More  importantly, however, is that you WATCH THAT CHANGE through the movie. Vivien turns down Edward's offer of an apartment to keep her off the streets - she told him \\"it's just geography.\\" Why? Because she \\"wants more\\" now. She's going to San Francisco, planning on finishing high school. As for Edward? He turned down a BILLION DOLLAR DEAL so that he could build boats. Boats, people.  <br /> <br />The movie is a fairy tale for adults. It isn't trying to say this happy ending is common - it's just one amazing story of an amazing place. Kind of like a new \\"far, far away.\\" It's like the random guy who talks at the end of the film: \\"Welcome toHollywood! ...Some dreams come true. Some don't...but keep on dreaming.\\" <br /> <br />I love this movie. It's Cinderella, people. It's about as probable as fairy godmothers and magic pumpkins, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.
0790729644|5.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" is no more a western than \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a biography. To reduce such complex films to such simple classifications would be to overlook everything important in them. \\"Unforgiven\\" is equal parts morality play, psychoanalysis, social critique and character study. But most of all, like \\"Citizen Kane\\", it is tragedy. It strives to show its central characters brought to ruin or death through tragic flaws: people doing horrible things not because they are evil, but because they cannot or will not overcome the worst of their natures. Eastwood's genius consists in his taking character flaws and turning them into moral flaws. This is the meaning of the title--what could easily have been called \\"Unredeemed\\" is transformed into \\"Unforgiven\\", because the rejection of redemption is unforgivable. <br /> <br />This extra insight is what makes the film great and allows it to transcend its genre. Prior to \\"Unforgiven\\", many westerns had already adopted the conventions of noire and showed anti-heroes unredeemed, riding off into the sunset, in no sense good men but generally none the worse for having killed others. In \\"Unforgiven\\", Eastwood shows us men who lose pieces of their souls every time they kill, and he doesn't shrink from applying this imperative to the anti-hero himself. Munny loses not only his old friend Ned, but the redemption that his wife had gifted him and that he had earned in turning his back on his past. This is the boldest statement that a man like Eastwood could make--as a director Eastwood figuratively disavows the characters that made him famous as an actor. This is no Man With No Name or Dirty Harry wreaking divine vengeance or cathartic retribution. This is a man who, in accepting his last bounty, kills unjustifiably, causes the death of a friend, and surrenders forever the right to forgive himself. <br /> <br />Eastwood would go on to make further films of incredible depth and stature. It is one of the most wonderful things to see a man, latein life, transformed from a one-note actor into a virtuoso director of subtle and almost infinite expression. \\"Unforgiven\\" is the first in a string of Eastwood triumphs, many of almost Shakespearean depth. But \\"Unforgiven\\" remains Eastwood's most well told story and richly deserves the boatload of awards that it harvested.
B00005JLK1|4.0|~May Contain Spoilers~ <br /> <br /> <br />This movie really doesnt offer anything new to horror addicts...but it does have a sort of \\"different\\" thriller to it...and it is sort of scarier because of the whole atmosphere, but other than that its nothing we horror lovers havent seen before. The gore is typical and normal, not very creative, but there were some \\"out there\\" scenes that were sort of wierd. <br /> <br />A group of people go to investigate a boat floating off the local coast, only to realize that it is haunted with spirits of the previous \\"riders\\". As time goes on they are slaughtered in different ways until the girl, of course, who else? realizes that the person who asked them to investigate the boat isnt nessecarily says he is, and finds a way to thwart his evil plans before he gains more and more power, unfortunately, this doesn't have a \\"protaginist winning\\" story...
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|\\"Mystic River\\" aspires to transcend its genre so boldly that I found myself overwhelmed by its audacity. Those who expect a plot driven murder mystery or a crime story will be sorely disappointed. In this film, the plot recedes into insignificance. Like all great works of art, the heart and soul of this work is not its plot, but its characters and its themes. The result is one of the most powerful explorations of tragedy to come out of modern cinema. <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood has crafted a film of unique scope, examining multifaceted aspects of tragedy with a mix of depth and simplicity that, on the one hand, relentlessly examines themes of sin, guilt, victimization and vengeance, while on the other, combines directing and acting so clean and uncluttered that we are not so much audiences to a narrative as we are witnesses to broken lives. <br /> <br />This film cannot be approached lightly. It is unsparing in its intensity. Characters are trapped in the arc of tragedy as inevitably as in a Greek play, unrelieved by either redemption or reprieve. The darkness of the story does not result from some self-indulgent existential auteurism. Rather, it arises out of an uncompromising sense of authenticity. Eastwood takes this tragedy to its honest conclusion and does not give in to the Hollywood hankering for happy endings. This is an intelligent film for mature people who refuse to put up with cop-outs. <br /> <br />The acting is nothing short of inspiring. Sean Penn is unforgettable as a tormented Jimmy who claws his way out of evil through the love of his daughter, only to sink back deeper than ever in the aftermath of her murder. Tim Robbins, in a similarly pitch-perfect performance, is tormented by even crueller demons, and never finds any sort of relief, save for transient moments of grace with his son. Kevin Bacon gives a subtle and restrained performance as a cop who acts as our disjointed moral sense, never sure of guilt or innocence, counting on the law to separate good from evil, and silently praying that that will prove sufficient. The supporting women, from Laura Linney to Marcia Gay Harden turn in performances in every way equal to those of the lead male characters. Character flaws abound, suspicion builds to blind fury, events unfold and vengeance compounds into tragedy until we arrive at an ending nothing short of Shakespearean. <br /> <br />It's a shame that the typical film synopsis leaves the impression that this is another who-dunnit. This film is no more about story than \\"Hamlet\\" is just about some guy out to catch his father's murderer. In both cases, focusing on the plot is to entirely miss the point. This film is a modern work of art, sharing a deeper kinship to masterful psychological studies like \\"Heart of Darkness\\" or \\"Crime and Punishment\\" than to any crime story. What matters is not how characters act, but why they act. We are compelled not by the arc of the story but by the arc of tragedy. We sympathise not with the virtues of the characters, but with their tragic flaws. <br /> <br />Approach this film the way you would \\"Othello\\". Then prepare to be moved by a depth of insight rare to our superficial age.
B0006399FS|5.0|It's an awful shame when morons intentionally set out to skewer an album;I'll be the first person to say that U2's latest album is not their best;but what we have here is an organized hate campaign by a few of  these idiots who have no desire of writing an objective review of this album,all they want to do is bash U2.In fact,a number of them have not even HEARD the album...maybe all they heard was \\"Vertigo\\" on the radio but you can tell they haven't heard the rest of it..nor do they want to.         I am seeing some of the same people write multiple negative reviews under different aliases....like the Pearl Jam idiot and others. Objective reviews are fine....organized negative reviews are not.
0316096199|3.0|I thought it was a good read- with an interesting twist at the end.  The writers conveys what it feels like to deal with a tough topic that makes everyone once close to her become removed from her experience and how she manages to find peace within herself to survive through her experience and continue with her life.
B00006GFAB|2.0|What is it with Kiss and greatest hits packages?  Don't Gene and Paul have enough money already?  Or is it that they don't have enough talent anymore to write any new, decent songs? <br />   If you are any kind of Kiss fan then you already have all of these songs on 10 other best of CDs.  If you are not a Kiss fan, and don't have any of these songs then where in the hell have you been hiding?  Please guys.  Enough with these greatest hits releases!  Put out some new, good material or go straight to the retirement home!
B000002UAX|5.0|First of all, to all the Kids Reviews, This is not a scary album.  How can you say this is scary it is completely Experimental.  How is The Continuing Story of Bungalo Bill scary, How is Piggies scary, how is Blackbird sscary, how is anything on this cd scary.  Revolution Number 9 isn't even scary, it's interesting.  Everything on this cd is interesting.  This cd shows you how each and every member is talented.  Since they were fighting at the time this cd was released, it is like listening to a mixed cd, not like when you listen to Srg't Peppers where it is the same genre of music or like Rubber Soul where it is the same genre of music.  You hear the Psychedelic, Rock, Pop, Meatl you hear it all on this album which makes it one of there greatest albums ever because of that.    Secondly, How can you say The Continuing Story of Bungalo Bill, Honey Pie, Revolution Number 9, etc is not good everything on  disc one and everything on disc two is amazing.  yes there are going to be a couple songs no one likes because that is how it is on almost every album (not every album, some have exceptions).  To me though I have to respect every song on this cd because it shows the talent of Jon, Paul, George and Ringo.  Like I said before it is like listening to a mix.  We hear the differences between Jon, Paul, George and Ringo.  Where as on other cd's we didn't.    My ratings:  Disc one is 100 out of 50  Disc two is 100 or of 50     Some of you guys need to know what talent is before you say this is the worst album ever.  becuase it might not be there greatest but it has to be pretty damn close because you hear Jons talent, Pauls talent, Georges talent and Ringos talent (like i said before).  Actually know The Beatles before you judge them.  Actually know what you are talking about before you judge them. Actually know them individually before you judge them.  Do some research for CHRIST SAKES.  One more thing to that damn KID how can you prefer Steely Dan and Bob Dylan over The Beatles.  Yes, I love Bob Dylan, but I can't choose him over The Beatles (I am not a big fan of Steely Dan, but I give the man Credit because he has talent).  Also just because Bob Dylan is a solo artist doesn't mean he is better then The Beatles .  One thing The Beatles have over Bob Dylan is that they can actually sing (The Beatles can write music also).  Bob Dylan is more of a Songwriter than a singer.  One thing Bob Dylan has over The Beatles is Bob Dylan's poetry is just amazing.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I just bought the cd \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" by Mariah Carey.  Let me tell you I fall short when I say I'm trully impressed by her voice and music.  This cd gots to be one of her best work in years after Butterfly.  You can trully appreciate her excellent voice in all the tracks.  You can't help but feel that mariah is having fun with her music feels less restrained vocally artistically and musically.  Every single track is unique in this album, something new for ms. mariah carey, the music found in the emancipation is new and fresh something we havent heard in a while in radio.  People tend to put mariah's music down, blinded by what they want to hear, stuck on the old mariah like daydream musicbox which where some of her best work.  But somethimg Mariah has shown us is that she never stays the same musically she is always evolving, and people need to accept that, just like people change music changes also.(personal note \\" Get Over It\\") Lets move on to new fresh music which is what The Emancipation of Mimi is.  This album is worth every penny.   <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are in order from best to least: <br />1.  We Belong Together <br />2.  Its Like That <br />3.  Say Something <br />4.  Shake It Off <br />5.  Mine Again <br />6.  Circles <br />7.  Stay The Night <br />8.  Get Your Number <br />9.  Fly Like A Bird  <br />10. Joy Ride <br />11. I Wish You Knew <br />12. One And Only <br />13. Your Girl <br />14. To The Floor
B00005A0N5|4.0|This is the third Nightwish album I bought (the first one was 'Once' and the second one 'Wishmaster'), and this album is okay. It's definitely good in comparison to their next album, Wishmaster. The line-up in Nightwish had been, at the time, Tarja Turunen (vocals), Tuomas Holopainen (keyboards, piano, and synthesizers), Emppu Vuorinen (guitars), Jukka Nevalainen (drums), and bassist Sami Vaska (who was replaced in 2002 by Marco Hietala). <br /> <br />On this album there are not many male vocals at all, which is good, because although I think that Tapio Wilska is okay for the two songs he sang in, I don't think I'd be able to tolerate his voice being used more often. <br /> <br />1. Stargazers-It's a very energetic song, talking about the stars, the moon, and the galaxy.  Tarja does a very good job in the chorus.  <br /> <br />2. Gethsemane-I think this is the weakest song on the album.  It's a song about Jesus and his time spent in the Garden of Gethsemane. There's just something about this song that doesn't hold my attention like other songs on this album do. <br /> <br />3. Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean-This is the first song with Wilska's vocals. I actually really like this song, it's very energetic. The lyrics were also excellent. The only thing that makes me cringe is that part where Tarja is singing 'Leave me be, leave me be, leave me...bee.eeeee', that just sounds rather strange. <br /> <br />4. Sacrament of Wilderness-This is probably one of my favourite songs on the album. There is an awesome opener. I love the continuing theme of snow angels in this. <br /> <br />5. Passion and the Opera- It takes a while to really be able to appreciate this song, but it's good.  Awesome cellos. <br /> <br />6. Swanheart-This is the first ballad. The lyrics are really nice, and soft. I think Nightwish has made better ballads but the song is still wonderful. <br /> <br />7. Moondance- This is an instrumental, for the most part. It's very bouncy, and it sounds like it has Russian (musical) influences. <br /> <br />8. The Riddler-I actually like this song quite a bit, it poses some very interesting questions.  It's very fast-paced, even though it's very long. <br /> <br />9. The Pharaoh Sails To Orion-This is another song featuring Wilska's voice. I like this song a lot better than the other song he's in.  The lyrics are really fascinating, especially if you're into Ancient Egypt. <br /> <br />10. Walking In The Air- This is a cover of the theme from 'The Snowman'. The song really does make you want to walk in the air. It's a soft song. <br /> <br />11. Sleeping Sun-This was written for the solar eclipse that was occurring in Germany. Even if you weren't there to see the eclipse, or if you didn't even know that there was an eclipse, you can still appreciate this song. It's slow, but it holds your attention. It's a great closing song. <br /> <br />All in all, I would reccomend getting this album, there are more good songs than bad, but I would suggest getting one of their other albums first, because if you buy this album first you might not form a very good impression of Nightwish.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I saw Citizen Kane for the first time the other day. I had never seen it, but had heard about it. It is a great, deep story. It is a human story. I was amazed at the complexity of the story, at the same time how it is a simple story. Everyone knows what \\"Rosebud\\" is, but not what rosebud represents. I don't want to give too much away, for the ones who may not have seen it. Get this movie and enjoy. Oh, and if your a \\"Simpsons\\" fan, get it and see how many gags the writers got from this movie. Citizen Kane is one of the influences for the character of Mr. Burns. Eeeeexcellent!
B00005JNRB|4.0|First of all, know that Sahara does not try to be something it's not - namely, a great movie.  It's simply a fun movie, and worth watching at that. <br />If you are a Clive Cussler fan, you might be upset because Dirk Pitt and especially Al Giordino are very different from the book characters.  However, Matthew McConaughey's Pitt is at least as cool and likeable a character as the book Pitt.  Plus, he's pretty doggone hot. <br />Another impressive thing about the movie is how clean it is.  Penelope Cruz's character manages to be a good female lead without being snotty and obnoxious.  There are no filthy sexual scenes and very little profanity.  On the whole, the movie is unbelievably wholesome.  McConaughey is fun-loving and even chivalrous; Steve Zahn as the sidekick is funny without being vulgar; the villains are improbable but manage to be evil without being slimy and repulsive. <br />Although the plot is pretty improbable and requires a LOT of the willing suspension of disbelief, if you've got an imagination you'll enjoy it.  On the whole, I'd say  <br />A) die-hard book fans, don't watch; <br />B) stodgy people, don't watch; <br />C) everyone else, have fun!
B0006284JQ|1.0|It's a product.  It's nothing more then a product.  This makes me sick.  It made me sick when she first appeared on TV and she still makes me sick.  She has machines fix her voice in the studio (she came from Louisiana I believe), she lip syncs onstage because she's too busy dancing with gay guys and therefore show no real talent.  Real talent is determined most of the time by how well you can pull off something in the live concert.  Britney doesn't have to worry about that, she's just a rich, spoiled plastic b*tch who doesn't care that she has severally brain damaged millions of girls.  But here's the thing, they are starting to grow up and catch on, people are rejecting her image and her music.  No body cares anymore, critics bash her, most of the girls have moved on, leaving the (...)style and going for somebody else.  And so are the record companies.  Her sales have dropped with each record, and this is their attempt at getting as much money as possible while she still has a fan base.      At my High school, there was a senior who was in love with Britney Spears, and was very stupid (I'm not the only one who thought so), and guess what job she wanted.  She wanted to be a model.  Clich isn't it?  Sad isn't it?  Pathetic isn't it?  If you answered no to those questions, then you too have had your mind raped by this product.  Chances are you have a mind much like that senior.  Listen here, take this as advice.  The next time someone tells you to listen to some real music, ask them what they mean by that.  Then go out and sample what they suggested.  Chances are you'll find something that will change your life in a far more positive way then this tramp.      Forget Michael Jackson, Britney is the one who has fondled the minds of many, many little kids, and many times it is accepted by the parents.  It's bad to buy a CD with a parental advisory on it but it's perfectly fine for your little daughter to buy something like this.  That's perfect sense.  *sarcasm*  Parents, if you think this is something good that your kids should listen to, I advise you to step back and let your kids discover their own music or give them something like guns n' roses, led zeppelin, something that you listened to (as long as it wasn't Madonna) or even Tori Amos.  None of this Spears, Simpson, J-Lo cr@p that has manifested itself in MTV.  Give them something that is talent.      My final comment about this Britney Beers.  Greatest Hits?  Are you joking?  This is pop chart singles on a disc.  She has no good songs, her most annoying is her telling someone to hit her, and she only has 4 albums out.  4 is way too early for a Greatest Hits or Best Of.  That's something for Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Guns N' Roses, the Beatles, etc.  something that actually changed music and won't be forgotten or considered to be an embarrassment.  This is a big cash grab plain and simple.  Anybody who listens to this pop cr@p.  Please grow up, don't become a stereotype.  That's all I cans say.  For those who weren't around when \\"hit me baby one more time\\" was everywhere, please avoid this and you won't risk having your brain damaged.
B000000H5K|5.0|just a good trash album and there are a lot of things this cd has <br />that some bands just don't have on their albums the only bad thing <br />the singer left and he made soulfly and i don't like soulfly that much <br />but i recommend this album to people who need different metal
0553208845|4.0|Never has such a short read been so inspirational. Through the entire spiritual journey that begins similar to that of the Buddha, but ends in drastic variance, I was enthralled. While I did find problems with the style of narration and the symbolism was at times crammed down my throat, the story itself was strong enough to keep me interested.
B00003CXCT|4.0|For fans of the trilogy the first noticable edition besides clean up, has been complete scene touch ups. One key scene (one that this writer was glad to see) was the redux of Vader's conversation with the Emperor from Empire Strikes Back (V). That bug eyed version of the Emperor is no more! The Rancor scene (the creature attempting to have Luke for lunch in VI)has been enhances. The original scene had noticable black lines in shots with Luke (Mark Hamil). Some add-ons raise a brow even among huge fans. The inclusion of a young Anakin (Hayden Christensen)standing next to a much older Obi Wan, and Yoda doesn't add up when you consider that Anakin died an older man. It wouldn't be the first time that George Lucas made a questionable change. The Special Editions (once officially part of the saga) were themselves the debate of both fans and fellow directors. Lucas will likely continue to make changes as he sees fit. As fans will simply stand in line. Changes or no, it's Star Wars and that's all I need.
0553212478|5.0|With a feminist mother, a philosopher father, and a poet as a lover, is it any surprise that a nightmare-stricken nineteen-year-old could come up with such a profound text. I've argued for the merit of this book in the past, and will happily do it in the future. Few stories from its time can compare.
B00005JNRB|3.0|Yes I am. I'm grateful for many things, and in this movie, what I am most grateful for is that Matthew McCaunoghey playing the lead, does not laugh as much as he could.<br /><br />Grateful that Harrison Ford wasn't resurrected to take the Indiana Jones roll<br /><br />Grateful that the first half of the movie soundtrack was actually quite good<br /><br />Grateful for the rose tinted glasses finally being removed from our view of Penelope Cruz (playing Damsel in Distress aka Ms Hotstuff)<br /><br />Grateful I could sit through the whole movie<br /><br />Less grateful I didn't watch something else<br /><br />Grateful I get enough satisfaction outta watching the movie by reviewing it here, on Amazon<br /><br />Grateful that my every expectation of this movie was fulfilled - it WAS a marginally entertaining remix of Bond/Indiana Jones hero adventures<br /><br />Mostly I am grateful that although the scriptwriters took advantage of every well-known plot twist, they refrained from having \\"Dr Evil\\" kidnap Cruz's character out of twisted love for her (although it was a near run thing!)<br /><br />So they let Cruz kick some *ss - they still had to excuse her presence by making her the romantic sideline for swashbuckling MC<br /><br />The actor I most enjoyed was goofy sidekick, as seen in such cinematic greats as... well there weren't any cinematic greats for this actor so let's leave it there<br /><br />kotori ojadis@yahoo.com
0767803434|2.0|Who decided to write this plot? Its boring! Although I am not expert, wouldn't the President's plane just have a bit more security? I mean, this is the president where talking about. Everything in this movie just seems so pat and set, there's always going to be an out, and surprise! Guess who's going to do it! Yes! Harrison Ford! Our president is going to kick (...)!<br /><br />Doesn't that bother anyone? This movie screams Hollywood and follows it so faithfully its scary. In real life, for that is what we are trying to portray, would the president jump out of a falling plane, try to save his rogue commander or any of the other numerous things that never stop happening? Maybe...maybe not. Obviously on Air Force One he's a superman, because he is able to do all these things.<br /><br />Air Force One needs to come down out of the clouds and have some reality shot into it. Other than that, this movie is a rather decent action thriller. Just for action mind you. That, and fans of Harrison Ford should apreciate his superhuman role.<br /><br />I didn't, but there's no saying you won't.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I've seen this movie last night and can only say: awesome. <br />End of the review, just: George Clooney has been created for this role.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|Decent without ever losing its stride and becoming good or better. The plot was good, but underwritten to many things happened that left questions. The first being... they didn't steal that much money to enable the thief to survive for so long and still have money to spare when they stole it back. What was it? Like fifteen million or so? Alot, but a far cry from the money heisted in Oceans Eleven or Heist.<br /><br />This is basically just an entertaining film,  you don't have to think about the plot, just sit there and let the movie while<br /><br />away the hours. If you like decent cars and ok acting than this is a movie for you, otherwise....
B0007O38F8|5.0|Now this review is for the edited version.  Hey what can I say--I bought it at Wal-mart.  Anyway, I'm usually disappointed when I purchase rap albums (Read: Jay-Z) because the cuts are nothing like what I'm hearing on the radio or seeing in the videos.  But this CD with its 20 something cuts was surprisingly entertaining.  My faves are: Candy shop, Disco Inferno, and Hate it or Love it.  While 50 Cents is no Tupac or Biggie, it doesn't mean that he isn't an interesting character in the Rap Game.  I enjoyed this CD.  Recommended.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Unlike the spinoff of U.S Marshal's the fugitive manages to enthrall us without seeming old or even having a plot being redone. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are so good in their respective parts that they have cheering for both sides as the film progresses.<br /><br />Definate Popcorn movie and anything else you feel compelled to eat while watching this.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000002513|2.0|I know many of you diehard Bruce fans rate this album high but.............. I think at this point in his career he was lacking musical direction. This album shows. Sure, it includes the classic \\"roseletta\\" but that's about it. He tries to jazz, tries to be like Dylan. Some of the lyrics are bad too. If you're a diehard buy it, but if you are a newbee to Bruce get \\"born to run\\" or \\"darkness at the edge of town\\".
B000002GQJ|4.0|In \\"Question of Balance,\\" the Moody Blues tone down the cosmic nature of their prior concept albums, and offer songs that are more straight-forward and solitary.  The album starts off with the Justin Hayward classic \\"Question\\" with its compelling lyrics, driving acoustic guitar, and moving ballad in the middle of the song.  \\"Question\\" is one of the Moodies all time greats which was lauded even by the toughest critics of the band.  It is easily the best song on the album.    I don't particularly care for \\"How Is It (We Are Here)\\" and find Pinder's lyrics particularly grating.  \\"And the Tide Rushes In\\" is a memorable Ray Thomas ballad, simple, but beautifully textured.  I know others love \\"Don't You Feel Small\\" and \\"Tortoise and the Hare,\\" but I think they are relatively average songs that don't really add to, or subtract from, the album as a whole.    Hayward again scores with \\"It's Up To You.\\"  It doesn't grab the listener immediately like \\"Question,\\" but it's a wonderful lighter-than-usual song with superb harmonies.      John's \\"Minstrel Song\\" is unique and better than average (is it just me, or does Carly Simon's \\"Let the River Run\\" from the movie \\"Working Girl\\" sound similar?).  \\"Dawning is the Day\\" is okay for Justin, but \\"Melancholy Man\\" is a particularly good effort from Pinder and requires many listenings to fully appreciate it.  \\"The Balance\\" is a silly biblical parable (similar to \\"In the Beginning\\" from \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\"), but quite enjoyable.  Overall, a very good album.    Footnote:  to this reviewer, about after the Moody Blues album \\"Octave,\\" band member Ray Thomas started getting the short end of the stick (Mike Pinder had left the band at this point).  These later albums would contain only one Thomas song, and, but for that song, Thomas' brilliant flute playing is, for the most part, absent.  Furthermore, Thomas' compositions are largely omitted from the ubiquitous greatest hits albums that have come out in the last decade or so.  For instance, although the wonderful \\"The Tide Rushes In\\" was included in \\"This is the Moody Blues (the first, and best, of their greatest hits albums) it was inexplicably omitted from \\"Time Traveller,\\" the boxed set, which further omitted Thomas' superb \\"Eternity Road\\" and \\"Our Guessing Game,\\" but included some other very average songs by, not surpisingly, Hayward and Lodge.  Just an observation!
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay is one brilliant band, they compose some of the best music of the day, and they are altogether one of the greatest bands of our time. I remember when I first heard one of Coldplay's interesting songs entitled 'Yellow'. I loved the song, although the video was a little strange, the song held onto its charm and intense emotion. I find A Rush of Blood to the Head to be a much more powerful album on a much more complex level, because it explores a more personalized spectrum of emotional feelings, its core is very haunting yet it is compelling. The great song entitled 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' named after the album itself is one of my personal favorites. Everytime I listen to it I become almost like a ghost, both dark and gray, and the world slowly vanishes from me, and I am lost in a world of music. The album is awesome.
B00005T30L|5.0|Yes, it's funny. Yes, it's quirky. Yes, Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen act their collective socks off. But the best thing about this movie is the unbelievably true way it depicts friendship. The scene with Thora Birch crying on the edge of the bed because her friend has rejected her is simply amazing. If you liked Welcome To The Dollhouse, you'll enjoy this.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I don't like Adam Sandler but I liked this movie. I think the acting was great from the entire cast. I really loved Cloris Leachman. I just wish the ending was a bit more uplifting.
B00009L1OB|4.0|For those that only recall \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and all the countless songs Duran Duran had on the radio, one can easily forget how different, unique and innovative a band like Duran really was in the early 1980s. Duran Duran were no doubt the first \\"new romantic\\" or \\"new wave\\" outfit that bands today like The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes, The Bravery, Interpol and the like are influenced by/imitating to a great degree of success. (Who said the '80s were never cool? The joke is on them now!)    The third album by Duran Duran showcases a different and more pop/dance-oriented sound the band was experimenting with at the time.  Elements of early Duran Duran, the dark, brooding and eerie \\"new romantic\\" sound they mastered on their first album and again on RIO, are less noticeable here.  Perhaps only \\"The Seventh Stranger\\", a stand-out track on its own, reaches back for the classic, darker Duran sound.  What is here is the masterful pop/dance rock music with elements like abstract lyrics (perhaps best personified in \\"New Moon on Monday\\") and  night club taboo grooves (of which \\"Union of the Snake\\" screams).  And then there is \\"The Reflex\\", which combines both elements to a flashy and climactic finish.      The underlying story of this album is that Duran lost a bit of its edginess as they struggled to maintain their original sound while trying to capture the glossiness that was friendly on radio at the time. (A struggle that eventually broke the original lineup apart in 1986.)  However, the relevance of the Duran sound has been vindicated by the current rush of today's top acts to say Duran Duran was an influence. And in many respects, the songs on this album sound better today than they did in 1983.  Even though the album was a huge seller and spawned three top 10 hits, it's a little uneven.  But when they deliver, they put forth some of the best material of their original run, like the engaging instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger\\" and the masterful pop of \\"(I'm Looking For) Cracks in the Pavement\\" and the highly underrated \\"Shadows on Your Side\\".     Some often forget Duran Duran was indeed a talented and instrumentally gifted outfit. The rhythm section of Roger Taylor (drums) and John Taylor (bass) are at long last getting their dues for the true talent they possess. Andy Taylor is an underrated guitarist who shines with both his delicate, atmospheric tones and what quickly became more urgent and rocking sounds, and Nick Rhodes does just the same thing, only with keyboards. Finally, Simon LeBon is perhaps the most brash and over the top front man since Mick Jagger, and that fit perfectly into the Duran style here, as by the time this album was released Duran were the kings of MTV.    Many of the songs on SEVEN AND THE RAGGED TIGER remain highlights in a live Duran Duran concert setting in 2005. You like The Killers? You like the rush of \\"new wave\\" influenced music currently underway?  This album, as well as \\"Duran Duran\\" (their debut album), \\"Astronaut\\" (their excellent 2004 comeback album), \\"The Singles 81-85\\" and \\"Rio\\" showcase the originators of the sound, of which there are many imitators (still today) but only one original.      Recommended.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Almost a decade later two adrift souls reconnect after a literature soir&eacute;e at one of Paris' infamous bookshops where cats and coffee belong to the mystique.  These two individuals are Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who now are wiser and simpler while their lives have actually become more complex.  Despite the complications in their lives, their reunion awakens old emotions from a day in Vienna some nine years ago when they toured the city and each other.  This time they only have a mere 60 minutes, as Jesse has to fly back to the United States like he did 9 years ago.  With no time to lose they begin to converse, as no time has passed since last.  Yet, both feel the pressure of time constraints, as they feel time breathing down their neck. This anxiety is caused by the ticking of time while they know that can only say so much, and they must wisely choose what to say.<br /><br />Interestingly the story brings the audience through a short verbal venture that recaps what has happened to them during the time between now and when they were supposed to have met in Vienna after their first encounter.  Through their personal narrations of what they have been up to, feelings and personal thoughts seep through the walls of tension that they both try to keep up in order to protect themselves and their presence.  As the minutes evaporate, personal concerns filter through cerebral stress and anxiety that rests on a limited foundation of expiring time.  An emotional distillation of verbal expression concentrates on what is important, yet they repress any emotional outburst, as they lean on their social and personal values.  This becomes a balancing act between fear and desire, as they both care for one another they do not want to offend the other, yet they desire to tell what is eating them inside.<br /><br />Delpy and Hawke perform in a brilliant manner, as they depict a delicate balancing act between what they desire and fear of loosing - each other.  The director Richard Linklater depicts the meeting with intense verbal outlet and touching delicacy where the honesty of words are covered in a jumble of emotion that confuses and bewilders both.  This is where the true brilliance of the film rests, as Linklater captures the essence of the reunion.  They desire each other, yet cannot say, as fear of possible pain that could visit them again if sudden erotic feelings were expressed.  Visualized pauses and awkward silence illustrates the duality of the moment where genuine emotion and logic crashes into the wall of apprehensive tension.  Nonetheless, random moments of Freudian feelings pop up without warning, which lightens up the mood between Celine and Jesse.  These moments depict the subconscious ability to surprise where repressed honest feelings infiltrate the anxious consciousness.<br /><br />Throughout the film Celine and Jesse seem to be on the move while knowing of the near impending separation.  This constant movement provides a visual unrest that enhances the lovelorn anxiety within the story, which also transfers genuine empathy for the characters.  Cleverly, Linklater captures the unrest, as they walk, travel by car and boat, and feel that they must gain as much as possible from their limited time together.  Simultaneously, there is an internal struggle within one of them, which seems to want to depart in fear of experiencing the same pain again.  Yet, they hold onto the moment while learning more about each other's pain and suffering.<br /><br />There is a continuous level of serenity within the story that Linklater captures by filming the story of a summer evening in the Paris sun.  The friendly atmosphere between Celine and Jesse combined with the easy flow of the camera from location to location without any sudden movement helps to induce this tranquility.  The calmness within the story suggests that there is something special going on between Celine and Jesse, but maybe it is too late, as they already have their lives in Paris and New York.  Nonetheless, the unbroken serenity provides a notion of something special, yet it also seems as if this calmness stirs up strong emotional currents from the past, which could be very hurtful.  The story does not provide any climatic moments.  It merely continues, as the clock keep ticking pressuring them about the expiring time.<br /><br />Before Sunset is a wonderful film about moments and opportunities in the light of signs and symbols that offer a chance to see the truth--the truth of what one wishes and desires while time rapidly warns that there is no time to loose.  An inner voice whispers, carpe diem, while logic tells one to ponder the long term effects.  This occurs while wisdom offers a middle path where one should follow one's own heart without listening to fear, or temporary pleasure.  All of this is shrewdly tailored in a cinematic experience that takes brilliant consideration to script, cinematography, performances, and mise-en-scene, which in the end presents truly great cinematic experience.have their lives in Paris and New York.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble is fantastic. His voice will take you where ever you want to go.I have to listen to this CD everyday, can't get enough. It's fabulous, can't wait for the next one.
B000002N2Z|4.0|This is probably Deftones' worst album, but it's a good CD. The style is a little harder than Around the Fur or White Pony, and the production values are rather low. Sometimes it sounds like the music is being made up on the spot, just people hammering away on their instruments with convoluted lyrics that aren't really about anything, but it somehow works, which is pretty amazing. Chino's vocals are as good as ever and most of the riffs are catchy enough. The only song I don't really like here is \\"Minus Blindfold\\". <br /> <br />Definitely pick this up if you own the other albums, but those new to Deftones should probably buy White Pony first, it makes this easier to get into.
B000957O82|3.0|Hitch was a alright movie but it just wasn't Will Smith. He could of done better. I think he's really good on action/comedy movies.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is the best hip hop album to come out in years -- point blank. Both the flows and the beats on each song are better than most of some of the most popular singles put out by most popular hip hop artists that have come out over the last decade. GET IT!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am a huge Mariah fan, mainly of the stuff that she did in the 90s. But, you gotta admit that the music she produced recently(ie Glitter) hasn't been that good.  But, THe Emancipation of Mimi totally turns the tide.  This album restores Mariah to her previous glory.  All of the songs are great and I didn't hit the skip button once...which is very rare.
0312263120|3.0|I will not review the plot as many other have done that already. The interesting part of the book is watching Dan Brown begin to develop his craft.  I have now read all four of his books and in some degree they are all similar but they improve.  Each is researched, although according to several reviews the research in this book is spotty especially as it relates to number theory and Spain. Each takes place in a long day.   In each the conclusion is reached just on time.   <br /> <br />Digital Fortress is not nearly as interesting as the others.  Also the plot is even more far fetched than the later efforts The characters are not as interesting  <br /> <br />All in all it was worth reading because it shows how someone who has become a master started.  I have  read that Mr. Brown is having trouble finishing his next novel. Maybe he is concerned that he has reached his peak and does not want to just mail one in as other authors such as Grishom have done on occasion.  Maybe he also has realized that he has hit his peak.  In any event it will be interesting to see what he does produce next. <br /> <br />In rereading this review I see I have spent more time talking about the author than the book.  After thinking about the Digital Fortress that is an appropriate comment. <br />
1400031354|5.0|I'm glad to say this is the second in the series and the action follows on \\"The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\" The reason I'm glad to say that is that it means there are three more to come that I have to look forward to. If such were possible, it's an improvement over N1LDA because the separate stories are more closely intertwined.  Each mystery presents an ethical dilemma rather than a clue driven puzzle, and each tale has a moral. The primary mystery is about a young American whose mother is trying to find why he disappeared.  Several others crop up, and Mma Rambotswe gets engaged to Mr Matekoni, who has been talked into adopting two children. <br />       It's written in a very simple moralizing style. I must confess I had qualms about whether Africans were being represented in a condescending way as lovable but childlike, and whether I was being seduced into an idealized sentimental Pollyanna view of Botswana.  Janet Malcolm's essay in today's New York Times Book Review has set my mind at rest a little, but even if I can't enjoy these books with a clear conscience I'll still enjoy them. <br />
038551123X|5.0|Before I picked up this book, I had not previously heard of Jeff Lindsay---well, all Im going to say is that Im sure glad I did!  The book was fast paced, and had an unusual twist.  I love reading mystery/thrillers and sometimes get disappointed when a book seems too formulaic.  However, this one definitely broke the mold.  I would never have thought that someone who is supposed to be one of the \\"good guys\\" would have that dark side.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves mystery/thriller type novels, and am eagerly awaiting his next book which is due to arrive in stores in July I think!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|It did take a creative genius like Tim Burton to put this story unto celluloid. While this film has entertainment value, the content is more of a serious nature. Aside from the depiction of an interesting father/son relationship, this movie also tackles vital aspects of human nature regarding the retelling of certain events, or stories that we all tell to put it simple. While these stories may seem unbelievable to some, these may be perceived by others as flat out lies. <br />\\"Big Fish\\" brings out the magic of the workings of our memories that while there might be even a significant underlying truth and actual events to every story, our perception and memories are also influenced and even dominated by our emotions at the time of such events and later on again when retelling and/or expressing such memories. It's the memories that nobody can steal from us and which we carry with us throughout our lives. <br />When we share our memories, the issue is not that we retell the exact detail of actual events, but rather that we let our human nature express itself with its emotions, passions to perhaps even share our dreams with others to communicate a moral to a story or maybe even an important lesson in life. We are creative individuals and this is what makes each one of us so very interesting and valuable. That's what this film brings out in a really exceptional way and that's why it is a literal masterpiece. <br />True, this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, but nevertheless it is a sweet story, and makes you think about yourself and other people in your life, as it is also a true classic motion picture event. The acting is absolutely superb as it is always the case with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor does a great job too. The scenery is beautiful and the photography is exceptional, and sure you will find some of Tim Burton's trademark shocking or even somewhat scary moments, but always the humorous relief. <br />I think this motion picture has been overlooked andit is definitely a treasure in every DVD collection.
0385510454|4.0|Even though I am only 22, I still remember when Grisham's classic, the Firm came out.  I have always been an avid reader, and remember reading that book shortly after it came out.  I became a fan of Grisham's book after I read that book.   <br /> <br />Recently, I have begun to think that he lost his \\"magic touch\\" as I have been disappointed with his last few books.  However, the Broker is quite a refreshing change from his last few books.  The character, plot, and pacing were all up to par.  An added bonus for me was the Italian incorporated into the novel, as I am currently taking Italian 2 this semester in college.  I have travelled to Italy in the past, and loved having Italy as the backdrop for this novel.   <br /> <br />Overall, I think this was a welcome departure from his last few novels and I definitely encourage others to read it!
B0007GAERG|2.0|Mariah is a legend because of the albums she had where she used her voice and her talent. Her sound was strong and clear, not this whispery half-hearted effort she exhibits on her last few albums, this one included. Granted there is a little more of her voice on this album, but it's sparse and still not what she's capable of. Mariah sounds like so many other no-name R&B singers on this album, and with the strength her voice has it makes it much more painful.    <br /> <br />Go back to your roots, Mariah. This style isn't flattering.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Was this insipid CD recorded by William Hung???? Madge can't sing &, the lyrics are hysterical. <br /> <br />She's hit rock bottom.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This CD got me from the beginning.  From the first few words of \\"Jaqueline\\" on into \\"Take Me Out,\\" and \\"This Fire,\\" \\"Michael\\" and finally with \\"40 ft\\" I was hooked.  Every song is good, in my opinion that makes a noteworthy CD.  I love these guys!  Granted, I'm always driving when I'm listening, and it's great driving music, but their sound is unique to me, with that driving, throbbing, Scottish beat throughout that just gives me (as someone else said) goosebumps! Treat yourself and buy this CD!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is one of those albums that gets better the more you listen to it.  It is refreshing to find a band that is difficult to categorize.  There is not a weak song which is amazing considering \\"Funeral\\" is their first full length album.  We plan on catching their show on tour as much as we can.  What will they bring in the future?  This fan can't wait!!
B00080Z53O|3.0|While \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" riled up angry conservatives nation wide, \\"The Sea Inside\\" flew under the radar while actually defending what some were accusing \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" of defending. On the positive side we probably learned everything we ever needed to know about the conservatives thanks to that flare up. We learned that they are so angry and drunk with power that they feel they can unnecessarily attack one of their own (Clint Eastwood), while at the same time being so culturally tone deaf that they were picking on the wrong movie.  Also, \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"-gate plus the Terri Schiavo incident should put to rest any notion that conservatives stand up for personal freedom. As far as this film goes, it is a good movie, but really can't stand up to \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" in any way. Dealing with the real life struggle of one man to end his life, it spends more time playing around with his personal life than actually debating the issue. Of course the movie is at it's best when it is debating the issue, as in the scene when Ramon stands up to the priest (if only we could get the Democrats to stand up to the Republicans). Also, the movie does not try to whitewash the dilemma. More than one character chooses life, and that makes the movie all the stronger. The ending of this movie is also very touching, as when Ramon sits in front of the sea before his death. You realize then that he was lucky to find a friend who was not so in love with themselves to help him end his struggle. On the downside, this movie does seem to fall victim to \\"Barbarian Invasion\\" (a movie I really did not care for) syndrome. In that film the whole fantasy was that when you die you'll be surrounded by all those that you love (even your wife and mistress simultaneously). If that film was a fantasy, then this movie is a super sized fantasy, because here Ramon lies on his death bed while the women around him fight for his attention. I'm sure when I look like that I'll  be lucky if my one girlfriend is still hanging around. The movie was also a wee bit melodramatic, but all that is forgiven because this movie has a heart and a mind. It's not a great movie, but still worth your time. ***1/4lfriend is still hanging around. The movie was also a wee bit melodramatic, but all that is forgiven because this movie has a heart and a mind. It's not a great movie, but still worth your time. ***1/4
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac has gone thru many incarnations exploring blues, rock, and experimentation. This collection takes you from the 70's thru today spannng 3 decades!<br /><br />The Mac changed line ups several times and after Peter Green's departure the band recruited Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks who had recorded previously under Buckingham-Nicks.  This added to Christine McVie (formally Brit Blues-Chanteusse:  Christine Perfect) gave the core members John McVie and Mick Fleetwood a much stronger line up of talents.<br /><br />Now armed with three singer songwriters the group rose even higher with early singles like the mythical \\"RHIANON\\" and the amazing selections from RUMOURS their penultimate album whose great songs include here such as \\"GOLD DUST WOMAN\\", the airy bewitching \\"DREAMS\\", and \\"DON'T STOP\\", \\"THE CHAIN\\" and the rockin' \\"GO YOUR OWN WAY\\" to name a few. The band then entered thru another experimental era via Lindsey Buckingham on TUSK a double album that spawned the title track as a hit single performed with a marching band. Another hit from TUSK is Stevie's dreamy \\"SARA\\" which makes you want to 'drown in the sea of love'!<br /><br />Of course around this time the group began to splinter due to tension among the shattered relatioships. The band members went their own way (wink!). One fruit from the solo projects is an accoustic live version of Lindsey's \\"GO INSANE\\" performed with the band in 1997 live...an incredible addition to this package.<br /><br />Stevie Nicks of course soared like the white winged dove to the pop charts extablishing herself as an important singer/songwriter but returned with the group for the MIRAGE album which spawned the amazing Buckingham-McVie duet \\"HOLD ME\\" and the Nicks swirling perfumed hit \\"GYPSY\\". It wouild be a few years later when Christine brought everyone back and recorded the album TANGO IN THE NIGHT which brought out \\"SEVEN WONDERS\\", \\"LITTLE LIES\\", \\"BIG LOVE\\"(here a great live version is presented), and Christine's angelic tune \\"EVERYWHERE\\".<br /><br />Lindsey soon parted ways and the Mac replaced him; but the magic had drained away and everyone disbanded again. It would be about 10 years later when they reunited for the RUMOURS anniversary tour and live album THE DANCE which spawned the hit \\"SILVER SPRINGS\\", an amazing omitted track from RUMOURS oringally on the b-side of \\"GO YOUR OWN WAY\\". The original studio version is included here.<br /><br />The songs in bold in the bio are included in this anthology which span the lives of Fleetwood Mac and help cement their music and magic!<br /><br />A great gift for both the die-hard MAC fan or the newcomer to great music!

0743454529|5.0|This is the third book I have read by Picoult and felt that it was absolutely AMAZING!  I like the fact that the story did not end up as the reader would have thought.  I cried so hard at the end.  It has been a long time since a book has had this effect on me.  Definitely a must read!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Wow, this is a kick ass album! It was one the last Van Halen albums i bought, because I was convinced it was a bad album. this was because there was only one song from it on the greatest hit. Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br />Maybe with exception for \\"Push Comes To Shove\\", this album is spotless. Basically all the different Van Halen DLR era music you want to hear is on this album. <br /> <br />It's very exciting and the song that intrests me the most was the last song \\"One Foot Out The Door\\", which has to be heard to be believed. It's quite short, but a really cool song. <br /> <br />I'm giving it 5 stars, because I can't really think of anything bening wrong with this album, so that's why it gets five stars.
B00004W52U|5.0|this is a really good cd. a great cd. the only thing that i mind is when i was reading these reviews i noticed people were saying the cd was great then naming songs that were \\"the best\\" i say every song was equally great. my favorite cd ever.

B00005JNTV|1.0|I have to be honest and say I've never seen the comic that this film is based on. So, I probably wouldn't be interested in seeing the comic for this. But I have to say that this is absolutlely, the most stupid, pathetic, movie I've ever seen. If I could rate it with 0 stars, I would. After about 5-10 minutes, I completely lost interest. For the first time in my life of watching movies, I felt like getting up and walking out. However, I didn't as I was with a friend. Partway through the movie, my friend told me she didn't care for the movie either and we both said that we couldn't wait for it to end. Afterwards, my friend and I talked about how horrible the movie was. Other people in the theatre also mentioned their displeasure with the movie. I felt like I completely wasted $6.00, and if it were possible to get it, I would want a refund. Don't bother wasting your time to see this movie!
B00004ZAZZ|5.0|I just love this album. I really love it. It's the Australian edition, where three new tracks are added: Girl in the Mirror, Heart and You Got It All. Oops! is really the best in the album (though it's not my favorite song in the album), and it's the title track and her greatest hit in it. Stronger, Lucky and Don't Let Me be the Last to Know, the other singles, rock too. I haven't listened to all tracks...yet. I got the album as a Christmas gift last year because Britney is my absolute favorite! Even if everyone I know hates her, she's my heroine.  <br /> <br />I also love the three bonus tracks - in fact, these are my 2nd to 4th favorite Britney songs (Toxic the first). Girl in the Mirror is so popular in the radio where I come from (Manila). I love it. Her cover of The Jets' \\"You Got It All\\", which I'm listening to as I type, is MUCH better than the original version. Heart, the Sarah-Geronimo-sounding ballad, is my favorite of the three. It's too beautiful. Had it been an original album track, it could've gone to the Greatest Hits album, although there's some gossiping of Britney and a friend at the end, hence the track is 29 seconds longer than mentioned in the album. <br /> <br />Britney, you rock, dude! Keep it up, and good luck with THE ORIGINAL DOLL!!!!! Your most loyal Filipino fan.

This one has two more tracks, Rock & Roll and Born. Actually, this album deserves 4.5/5 stars. I don't really like the order of songs, and it lacks two songs. <br />If I were to fix the album, it would be: <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative <br />2. Stronger <br />3. Born to Make You Happy <br />4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman <br />5. I'm a Slave 4 U <br />6. Overprotected <br />7. Don't Let Me be the Last to Know <br />8. Outrageous <br />9.

Lucky <br />16. Boys [CO-Ed Remix] <br />17. I Love Rock & Roll <br />18. Me Against the Music <br />19. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) <br />20. Do Somethin' <br />21. Everytime <br /> <br />Everytime's a good closing song because it's a slow ballad, which is very nice as a closing track. My Prerogative is good as opening. Born to Make You Happy sounds better after Stronger (I guess), and the Oops until From all sound better in that arrangement.  <br /> <br />But even if it has 19 tracks only, I really love this album. It's my favorite album in the world! Britney rocks! She's the Queen of Pop and Rock!!!
B00005JLR8|5.0|A sweet, magical movie where love conquers everything, even grief, and where hope can bridge even the infinite which divides the living from the dead. <br /> <br />Stellar performances by everyone, including Samantha Morton, Paddy Considine, and Sarah and Emmy Bolger. <br /> <br />Great praise, of course, to Jim Sheridan, who understands the power of drama which exists in our aspirations. <br /> <br />I couldn't recommend this movie higher.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Hilarious. That's the only word you can use to describe this movie. It's just so funny you won't know what to do! You can watch it over and over again and find new things to laugh at! It's got kind of a strange humor that you will either love or hate, but nearly everyone that I know absolutely loves it. Check it out if you love offbeat humor and randomness.

I thought this would be the same, but it wasn't. Boo. I couldn't be bothered watching it after an hour, so I gave up.<br /><br />I don't know what it was about this movie, but mainly for me, it was really boring. And it was a lot darker than I remember the kid's story too. I didn't like Jason Isaacs, who played Hook, but then I did grow up with the utterly camp Dustin Hoffman playing Hook in Hook. :) (And something I didn't know, following tradition in both theatre and film, the actor portraying Captain Hook is the same actor portraying Mr. Darling, in this case, it's Jason Isaacs. I thought they looked familiar!) Also the kids played on my nerves a bit. Not so much the actors playing Wendy & Peter, but John & Michael. And Smee just wasn't the same as Bob Hoskins playing him.<br /><br />It's quite weird as well, there's a lot more of a relationship between Wendy & Peter than I've seen before - shall we soon be seeing an adult version?! I'm not sure what it was, but there was a lot of talk at the start of the movie, where they talk about Wendy having a \\"kiss\\" at the corner of her mouth - what was all that about?! And it sounded like they were talking of marrying her off when she was barely 13! I thought this was made in the early 1900s, not the medieval days! (And don't even get me started on the dog as a nanny - I didn't get that as a kid, and I don't get it as an adult.)<br /><br />Jason Sumpter was OK playing Peter, he's totally your stereotypical picture of Peter, but there was something always quite right. You could see how much he grew up during the film - he went from 5 feet tall to 5' 8\\" during filming. The window of the nursery had to be rebuilt 4 times because he kept hitting his head on it.<br /><br />The thing I loved about the book (and the wee bit in Hook) was Peter coming back and seeing Wendy growing up. Apparently, there was an alternate ending was shot where Peter meets the adult Wendy and her little daughter Jane. I don't know why this part of the story always appealed to me. (And seeing the Lost Boys grow up too - I loved that!)<br /><br />A cool little bit of trivia for you - the preview trailers for this film used music from the video game, \\"Myst III: Exile\\", but the music was never used in the film itself.<br /><br />The film was noticeably cut, and at one point badly, as I noticed it! (And that's saying something.) I have the region 2 version of the movie, and before I switched it off, Peter & Hook are fighting (in the cave I think), and it looks like Hook is about to headbutt, when we suddenly, and very abruptly cut to the little rowing boat. This was cut in order to secure a PG rating. I also think we lose the bit where John & Michael are hanging upside down, and on some versions you see them from behind, with their nightshirts over their heads.<br /><br />I found one similarity between this & Labyrinth, particularly since in the children's bedroom, there is a lot of pirate, mermaid etc stuff, very similar to the scenes in Labyrinth.<br /><br />The extras on this look pretty cool, and are split into different sections, some categorised under the different places that appear in this. The extras include: 11 featurettes; Visit the Darling House: Alternate Ending. What happens when Wendy is all grown up! Hilarious Deleted Scenes. In the dog house with Mr. Darling; Board the Pirate Ship: Through the Eyes of Captain Hook - Jason Isaacs' behind-the-scenes Home Video Footage! The Lost Pirate Song - The Swashbucklers sing a deleted tune; Explore the Neverland Forest: Tinkerbell - Behind the Fairy Dust. I Do Believe in Fairies - Inside the magical world of the fairies; Enter the Black Castle: Learning to Fly - Go on set to the \\"Flying School\\" training camp. Mermaids' Tale - Behind-the-scenes with these mysterious mermaids; Dig into the Home under the Ground: The Legacy of Pan - Duchess Sarah Ferguson gives an insider's look at how the story of Peter Pan came to be!<br /><br />I haven't seen another bad review about this movie, so I feel slightly disappointed to be giving it a two-star review. I'm going to keep the DVD though, as the extras look really good, and I might be persuaded to give it another try at some point. Now bring on the adult version!maids' Tale - Behind-the-scenes with these mysterious mermaids; Dig into the Home under the Ground: The Legacy of Pan - Duchess Sarah Ferguson gives an insider's look at how the story of Peter Pan came to be!  <br /> <br />I haven't seen another bad review about this movie, so I feel slightly disappointed to be giving it a two-star review.

B00007GZR5|5.0|This is a wonderful, life-affirming movie about personal tragedy. It's about what it takes in a person to surmount tragedy, to take it in fully, to surmount it, to build more of a life even in the presence of that tragedy, and to continue even in the enveloping fact of death. And yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />I like this movie, but all that chick-lit surmounting stuff doesn't do it for me. What does is good visuals, and this movie has never been equalled. Turn off the sound if you want, just drink in this magnificent achievement for the eyes. That first sight of heaven is all about juicy, wet paint. Hell is not just a church inverted, it's a gray place. Red fabric, billowing in the wind carries another message, though I'm not sure what. Blue shirts most often carry a message, too - again, I'm not sure what.<br /><br />In the larger sense, this movie is about Life (but I disagree with it). It's about Death (and I disagree again), then it's about more life (and I still disagree). Well, that doesn't matter much.<br /><br />It's OK to like this movie for its tear-jerking side. It's better to like this for the stereotypes that it breaks, or that it uses in unique ways. It's best to sit back and let a unique visual experience open up in front of you.<br /><br />//wiredweird.
B00004T9AF|1.0|Why this recording is so hyped by the critics is beyond me. <br />Any individual with a good musical training and a recording studio could write something like this. This is just a bunch of embellishments over two poor musical themes. Save your money.
B00005JKTF|3.0|This movie disappointed me.  The performances of all involved were EXCELLENT.  But the screenplay was awful.  Charlotte should have ended up with the pilot, Peter Gregory, and if not, they should have left him dead.  Very sad indeed.   <br />There was not enough chemistry or building of a relationship to believe for a minute that she'd go all the way back to be with the French resistance fighter.  Especially when she lets him flee alone without her and she returns to London. <br />Flawed story, poor plot.  I was very disappointed in the story.

B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I was so sick of Brad Pitt's puffy face by the end of this movie.  He was in practically every scene and it really ruined the movie for me.  The story wasn't developed enough, Branna's part as Hector was fabulous and his portrayal was fabulous.  Orlando Bloom's character Paris was downright cowardly, foppish and almost dislikable.  <br />I really felt the part of Achilles was badly played, and it was very hard to believe Brad Pitt was this great warrior.  He's just not the type.  He was too small and not believable at all that he could be beating all those men.   <br /> <br />See another epic, see Gladiator or even Braveheart, over this.  I hope it does not kill Branna's career.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I agree with the multitude of music reviews from Rolling Stone to Entertainment Weekly that are calling this one of the best rock albums in many years. Even non-fans are finding this CD to be innovative, catchy and most importantly, compelling. Amazing, given how Green Day used to be written off as a punk band.  People will be listening to this album for a long long time. Give it a listen. It's musically and lyrically outstanding.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Rating:A+  Katsuhiro Otoma is quite possibly one of the greatest writers/artists ever in the field of anime and moviemaking, and Akira shows that even the most epic of ideas can be fully accomplished with devoted time, as well as effort. Though the movie only scratches the surface, of what the comics delve into so much more deeply, the movie itself is not flawed in any aspect, and is truly the epitome of animated movies that not only has withstood the test of time, but still eclipses modern moviemaking as well. Telling the story of a biker gang that is run by the leader Kaneda, as he is accompanied by his friends, most notably Tetsuo, his best friend, who strives throughout the movie to not be treated like an inferior individual, the movie pushes you mind and imagination into areas where your emotions are grabbed from your soul and wrung out like a damp towel. As these two friends are drug through the war that is raging in Neo-Tokyo in a post-apocalyptic world in 2019, after the effects and destruction of World War 3, strong dominant politicians, and government agents emerge to fuel the fire of this amazingly multifaceted storyline.  After an accident on the outskirts of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo is left in shambles and taken to a hospital, where his friends are unable to get into contact with him. Tetsuo emerges with newfound \\"abilities\\" that tap into his inner psyche, and show us the true power of the human mind. Saying too much about the story would spoil too much, as truly whether you are a fan of animated movies or not, this is one movie that must be seen to be believed. Friends of mine that bashed this movie for so long, actually sat down and watched it, and came away understanding why myself and others hyped it up so much. Though it might require multiple viewings to truly understand, the emotional afteraffects, of friends torn apart at the seems, can connect with each and every one of us. However, this movie is definitely not aimed at a younger audience, and is highly recommended for mature audiences, even teenagers, who have an open mind and are willing to sit down for two and a half hours, and have their mind twisted and contorted. After walking away from the movie I dare you to say that this movie did not strike an emotional cord, as truly it is and will always remain one of the finest accomplishments in all of moviemaking, period.

B0006SSOHC|1.0|I want my money back, this was one of those movies that in the first 15 min you know you have made a bad investment. Figure it takes 30 min to make money at a job to rent this but it takes 100 min to watch it, now you have totally wasted 130 min of your life.  Watch the Exorcist or even Barney instead you will be more pleased  with the end result. Only thing it had going for it was the last 4 minutes which I will not give away. But it was the best minutes out of the whole experience. Maybe they could just rent a dvd with 4 minutes on it of the ending?? I might have been more willing to pay for that.

B00005JNRB|5.0|Breck Eisner's \\"Sahara\\", adapted from a Clive Cussler novel odf the same name, may look, at first, like a routine action comedy. The action sequences are overdone and outlandish, the plot is thisck enough to hold up for a solid 137 minutes, and the stars are giant. All of that is true, but it adds to the endearing charm of the movie. Really, it's just a throwback to the old Indiana Jones films, but this seems much more accomplished. It seems as if the action really explodes off the screen, and that when something is fired, a gun or a cannon, the theater seems to vibrate. The film works on many levels, one of which is that it evenly balances comedy and action. The first scene, which is very misleading, launches directly into an action sequence, and it seems for a while that \\"Sahara\\" will be just another run-of-the-mill adventure with the overly cocky adventurer and the joke making sidekick. OK. That again is true, but it is done in a much better way. Adding attempted rape to the plot (on part of the villains, not the heroes), also makes the film different. Usually the heroins are resourceful, but early in this movie we learn that Penelope Cruz's character is anything but. It takes a spear gun and a severed hand to get the criminals away. The scene is, however, relevant to the plot and not just a weirdly out of place scene. At times, the movie drags a little, such as scenes where the heroes are captured over and over again, and one must ask at one point \\"If the team was already in the villains fortress, why did they leave and come back?\\" I still think it was so that they could shave and get a nicer car, but I may be wrong. I have heard people calling this movie \\"National Treasure 2\\". Alright, that just isn't true. First off, \\"National Treasure\\" was PG, so there was no spurting blood when people where shot, and I don't remember a person ever getting their hand sliced off with a harpoon gun. Funny, too, I also don't remember people getting sliced off with machetes. There is another plot that is not given away in the preview (more on that later), and it adds to why it is unfair to call this movie \\"National Treasure 2\\". I also don't remember attempted rape in \\"National Treasure\\". Or do I? I liked both movies, but if I had to pick between the two, i would probably pick \\"Sahara\\", just because it was more daring and had better action sequences. One scene, set in a power plant reactor of some sort, is spectacular and quite original. I must say that the sequence in itself was one of the best choreographed I have ever seen, and also contained some astonishing special effects. <br /> <br />The plot revolves around soap-opera named Dirk Pitt (Mathew Mcconaghey) and his sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn, who really should just be a full time sidekick) searching for a war ship from the late 1800's that carries a large treasure. Along the way, Dirk meets, or more rescues, doctor Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz). Eva works for the World Health Organization, also known as the W.H.O. She is investigating a strange sickness that is sweeping Mali and leaving its victims with bloody holes in their body and wildly disfigured eyes. There are sinister people who do not want Eva to learn the origin of the disease, and they will stop at nothing to kill Eva, Dirk, and Al. Early on in the film, the army ambushes Eva's crew and threatens then with death, so Eva is now truly scared. William H. Macy turns in a good performance as Jim Sandecker, the captain of the boat Al and Dirk work on, and the person that contributes heavily to the troups trip. The film spans to about three locations in the 2 hour 17 minute running time, and their is an action sequence in each.  <br /> <br />The movies action scenes stretch from five minutes being the shortest to twenty minutes being the longest. Although they stretch forever, and contrary to what I may have implied, the movie has more than three action scenes and they never seem to grow old. They keep you on the edge of your seatall the way through, and the special effects never grow old, as they did so quickly in the similarly themed (and set) \\"Scorpian King\\". I liked how the movie wasn't all action, and how the film graciously took its first hour to introduce characters. I also enjoyed the movies many references to those strange 1940's action movies( the opening title sequence pans across a wall of newspaper clippings and the title is accompanied by the subtitle \\"A Dirk Pitt Adventure\\"). Nice touch. But that is what the whole film is. One good, fast paced, funny, thoroughly entertaining popcorn action film. This is officially the first good action blockbuster of the summer. If only they all could be this good. <br /> <br />\\"Sahara\\" is approximately 137 minutes and is rated PG-13 for Violence, which is at times graphic with shootings and stabbings, and lots of bombing and helicopters exchaning gunfire. Most of it is non-gory except for a thoroughly graphic scene involving a severed hand and a harpoon gun.
B00008LOS1|5.0|First off, this is a message to the people at amazon.  I've noticed a lot of bogus reviews where you get these pin heads with nothing better to do then to give one stars to classic albums.  This is only being done so they can pull down the over all rating of perfect albums like this.  The fact is that todays recording tricksters will NEVER match the greatness of The Who, The Beatles, The Stones, Led Zeppelin, or anyone else from that period.  If you look at any art form (fine art, theater, or other forms of music) they all have a golden period, this was Rock/Pop's.  So all you little Rap and so called Alternative listening wankers listen up, THE WASTE OF AUDIO TAPE YOU LISTEN TO DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN THE SAME RECORD STORE WITH THE WHO.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it!

Jude Law has the sexual attention of both Roberts and cute as a vixen on fire with a whip, Natalie Portman, and the geeky nerd chooses the older, stiff as a board Roberts. Dysfunctional? Maybe. Stupid? Absolutely. Clive Owen marries Roberts and after a marital indiscretion, retreats to watch Portman do a slinky striptease pole dance. I should have such troubles. Anyway, love is hate and hate is love, or something like that. Julia Roberts barks out a mouthfull of obscenities, ripping open a sexual current not unlike an audio Hustler magazine teaser sound bite. Grrrroooowwll! Natalie Portman has a great lower back. Fish swim in The London Aquarium. Clive Owen, dude, if you can sing, if this acting thing don't work out, you could be the next Tom Jones. Natalie Portman, smart move. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!  She looks around at the other actors and says, \\"Hey, you guys ain't thirtysomethings! You're all fortysomethings and Julia is ... I'm gonna beat it and find a younger crowd to swing with.\\" Sweet move, darling. You'll always find work.

Miller was very cautious as to whether or not he wanted to bring his comic to the big screen (he had been burned by Hollywood before with \\"Robocop 2\\"). But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is much in the same way & inspiration as that of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film. A minor debt he owed to Rodriguez, since Rodriguez supplied Tarantino the score to both editions of \\"Kill Bill\\" for one dollar). If you like \\"Fiction\\" you'll love \\"Sin\\".<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.<br /><br />The first two stories bookend the film.

The cop gets in over his head when he finds out that The Bastard has family in high places.<br /><br />The 3rd story has a former boxer turned nutcase, by the name of Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is looking for the killer who killed off his favorite & only prostitute, Angel, & getting framed for the whole thing.<br /><br />The final story has a brutal cop and his buddies getting killed by a group of prostitutes, in Prostitute Row, a section of Sin City that is ruled by its prostitutes.

0393324818|2.0|Let's see ... as of April 2005 Jeremy Brown (one of the picks highly touted by Billy Beane in the 2002 draft and detailed in Chapter 2 of the book) is playing double-A ball with the Midland RockHounds.  His stats for 2004 were .256 BA, six home runs and 49 RBI.<br /><br />As of April 2005 Jeremy Bonderman (2001 1st round pick for the A's; this pick so enraged Beane that he threw a telephone through the wall, and in part led to the dismissal of the scouting director) is 2-2 for the Detroit Tigers, with a 4.28 ERA.  In 2004 he was 11-13 with a 4.89 ERA.  He has been starting games for the Tigers since 2003.<br /><br />It's a bit too early to say that Bonderman will be a success or Brown a failure, but this and other examples in Moneyball lead a questioning mind to wonder if Beane may be using sabermetrics to an extreme.  Unfortunately the author doesn't question anything in this book.  His writing is filled with slavish praise for Beane and his like-minded front office, and derision for those who haven't embraced sabermetrics fully.  The book also doesn't mention the effect of the A's pitching trio (Mulder, Hudson, Zito) on the team's success.  As a result, I agree with an earlier review that this book resembles a PR piece more than an unbiased review of Beane's methods.  Even as the author admits he \\"fell in love with the story\\", being more objective or even playing devil's advocate on occasion would have this a much more interesting read.  Disappointing book.

After reading this book it gave a completely different point of view on life and death.  So many of us take the little time we do have on earth for granted and Morrie taught Mitch that we cannot do that if we want to make the most out of life.  I think anyone who reads this book will be completely changed by this book.  You won't want to put this book down until you finish it believe me, I couldn't put it down when I had to.

I cant distingusih songs apart, and sometimes thats just fine, but this album never goes anywhere.  it just drones on like a test screen.  I cant listen to more than 2 songs at a time without falling asleep, which was terrible case i was driving!

For me, \\"We Belong Together\\" is equally as striking if not more moving actually. Mariah always has at least one song that just grabs your attention from the beginning and this time it's \\"We Belong Together.\\" But she doesn't stop there. I consider \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" to be the contemporary of her debut. Both equally as stunning, but born in two different eras.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Many ppl say that Avril Lavigne can not sing and can not play the guitar bc she relies on her band. Well this cd definately show she can sing.   She has also performed by herself with just her acoustic guitar on many shows including The Ellen Show, Mad TV, Snl, and MTV unplugged.  Avril Lavigne can definately sing, play the guitar, and is an awesome song writer.      I am definately an Avril fan.  I thought her first cd was good but her second was great.  It touched apon much more topics and was definately a change from her first poppish album.  The cd has so many good songs, right wen i listened to it i knew which songs were going to be her next hits.  Her cd closes with a song dedicated to her grandfather who died before one of her concerts--another song tat is so great ---This cd is definately one to have--i definately recommend this cd
B00005JKL8|1.0|While the acting of the movie and the graphics are subperb it lacks in story and plot, the movie is placed in the former kingdom of Yugoslavia where the so called \\"evil\\" Serbian forces are \\"killing\\" innocent ethnic Albanians which by the way the NATO invasion of Yugoslavia turned out to be bogus and the so called mass graves found turned out to be fake, as well as all the crimes they placed against Serbian army, our star Owen wilson's character happens after detouring his planned flight just so happens to spot these activities and captures them on his F-18 recon jet, soon after his violation of Serbian air space, he is shot down with his navigator(weapons officer) his navigator is shot and killed by the \\"ruthless\\" Serbian army, soon after Owen's character is off and running trying to get across to a safe pick up zone, all awhile being hunted by a expert serbian soldier.... after some time our character gets picked up and rescued but not after of course getting the incriminating evidence from the ejection seat back where the movie started, and in a typical Hollywood BS a small wing of navy hueys on level ground over the edge of a cliff are able to beat back  a small army of tanks and APC's while the serbian soldiers miss every single shot they fire out of thousands of rounds but the americans are able to pick up the single soldier and get away without damage, AMAZING *cough cough*<br /><br />Well if you don't mind watching such rubbish and are only interested in the action the movie can be okay, but if anyone prefers a bit of realism and facts in their movie this one is NOT for you.<br /><br />To: \\"M.T.\\" and I can tell you the factual horrors of what the KLA  were doing in the early 90's to the serbian civilian population, during their \\"cleansings\\" the fact is this movie tries to pro-market the NATO aggression on serbia.<br /><br />\\"Also I will tell honestly to readers of this comment that this is NOT my real name, and I won't pretend to be as Mr \\"Flick\\":\\" And there is nothing false of my name, Flick is German, M is a initial for my first name, you might be afraid of people knowing your name, but I am not.ame, Flick is German, M is a initial for my first name, you might be afraid of people knowing your name, but I am not.
B0006M4SO6|1.0|Sad to say, this is not PMG's best work.  It seems uninspired and  derivitve.  When I watched PMG recreate the album as their opening number in a recent concert, I found myself looking forward to its conclusion so I could hear some quality PMG work.  During the concert, I did get to see Lyle Mays playing arena rock power chords on guitar.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
B00003CWPR|1.0|This is a very bad movie. The acting is poor, the script trite, and editing less than decent, and the plot has more holes than swiss cheese. This movie was entirely bland and Nicole and Tom had no chemistry to speak of. The beginning of the movie was embarrassing and foolish.  This movie gets two thumbs down, and all ten toes for that matter!!!!!!!
0451205146|5.0|A couple years back I saw an amazing movie, Black Hawk Down. I was so moved by the movie that once I heard it was based on a book I eventually went out and bought the book. Before I go into the book, I should make a not that I count the number of books I've read that I wasn't required for school without having to take off my shoes. Even though I'm not a big reader, I knew this would be something I'd enjoy. It did take me a while to finish with the book clocking in at 430 pages. Not to mention my penchant of reading my magazine subscriptions before getting back to my place in the book <br /> <br />As for the book itself, everyone should know the story by now. Like the movie, it chronicles the failed 1993 mission in the Somali capital of Mogadishu that ended with two Black Hawk helicopters being shot down by Somali insurgents that left many Americans solders dead or wounded. The movie itself did a very good job keeping with the spirit of the movie, but with the book at 430 pages, there were plenty of things that were left out of the 144 minute movie. Where the movie focused almost exclusively on the actual battle, the book covers more of led up to the conflict and goes more in depth analyzing the outcome. The movie also depicted only a handful of the solders that were involved the book profiles about three times more. The movie spent almost of the screen time focused exclusively on Somalia, but the book also looks into the families of the soldiers back home and also looks in on some of the response from Washington.  <br /> <br />Included in the version of the book I bought (the Movie Tie-In Edition) was an eight page Afterword by author, Mark Bowen, written in 1999 as it was interesting to hear Bowen talk about the impact his book made (even before the movie was made), even being embraced by the military itself. It would be interesting to see what else he would say about the impact now that the movie has been released. <br /> <br />The Back Hawk Down incident is evenrelevant today as we are currently fighting a primarily urban war in Iraq. Many of the problems the soldiers were facing in Mogadishu, the current soldiers are facing in places like Baghdad and Fallujah with not being able to tell the difference between insurgent and civilians, the opposition carrying rocket launchers and other high-tech weapons, and questions of \\"why are we there?\\" from a portion of the population back home. Interestingly enough, Bowen said in the book that not finishing the job in Mogadishu would make the United States look week opening us up to attacks abroad thinking we would retreat like we did in 1993. And it looks like he was right with the Embassy attacks, the attack on the USS Cole, and later the September 11th attacks. Many experts even point to Somalia as the inspiration for Osoma bin Laden and Al-Quada.
0385659806|4.0|I read this book after telling myself that I would avoid the novel because everyone was raving about how great the novel was, and I didn't want to get caught up in the rush.  Thankfully though I ended up having a business trip with nothing else to read but a copy of this book, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.<br />This is a mystery novel, written and narrated by the detective who is going to solve the crime.  Only the detective isn't a police detective, but a 17 year old man.  And what's more, this man has autism.  This later fact makes for great reading, because it allows the author to put a very unique perspective on his story and words.<br />I must commend Mark Hadden for a very well written and descriptive book.  Although one might think that reading a book written from an autistic perspective would be difficult to understand, quite the opposite is true.  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time flows quite well from chapter to chapter, and at no time is the reader left wondering what's going on.<br />This is a good novel and one that I should have read a long time ago.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Wu-tang! Wu-tang! Wu-tang! <br /> <br />The reason why Wu-Tang Clan gets away with chanting the name of their crew over and over is that they have an intellectual philosophy behind it (beyond the martial arts inferences) that poignantly outlines the hopes, dreams, and struggles of Black Americans coming up from the slums, with religious undertones. <br /> <br />This \\"G-Unit!\\" chanting that 50 cent and his stable mates do is, like the whole \\"Wu-TANG!\\" thing, part of his musical theme, however there is no point behind it other than gratuitus \\"gang-repping\\" (like most hardcore mafioso, G-Unit prints Tshirts and Jeans and sells them in department stores --*eye-roll*) and because he mistakenly thinks that catchy gimmicks will distract listeners from the fact that he is a sh***y rapper. <br /> <br />The Massacre is a terrible album. I have the feeling that when he is an old man (assuming he lives that long -- if he gets shot [god forbid] he probably won't be martyred like other slain hip hop legends) 50 will look back on most of his musical career and think, \\"wow, I sure was a jacka$$ when I was young.\\" <br /> <br />The fact that the only listenable tracks for me are the already played-out club hits \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"Candy Shop\\" (these songs are trendy when new but get supremely annoying after a while) tells me that 50 is more of a popstar than someone who actually reps anything remotely connected to the hood. His songs are very time-sensitive and not timeless. You'll hear them two years later and not really want to bump them anymore. I'll give him props for \\"In Da Club,\\" which is an anomaly for 50 since it is still a good track. A lot of \\"Get Rich...\\" is trendy and poppish just like this album, but unlike \\"The Massacre\\" the songs from \\"Get Rich...\\" were Fifty Cent when he was fresh and new and not Fifty Cent when he was out of ideas and repeating the same ones over again, and they weren't original in the first place. <br /> <br />50s best work is 50 being a Top 4- schill and not 50 desperately trying to look like he's really NOT a gigantic fraud and sellout who couldn't rap his way out of a paper vest, let alone battle rap his way out of his teflon. <br /> <br />50 is obviously a prepackaged, corporation promoted \\"gangster\\" that people who have absolutely no idea what slum life is like can buy records from in the erroneous belief that listening to 50 cent turns them into some sort of true hip hop head or hood, and rich people who control 50 from their clean Fifth Avenue offices are loving every penny (certainly more than \\"fifty cents\\") of it. <br /> <br />This record is boring and doesn't say ANYTHING. 50s rhymes are elementary and rely totally on the production to make him listenable. His delivery style is stupid. Mumble mumble mumble. \\"B***h this, I'll shoot you that... blah blah blah, mumble mumble, glower... \\"hey did I mention I know Emimem?\\" <br /> <br />It would be nice if the beats produced for this album were used by an artist who could torch some hot lyrics over them. Good beats and a good rhymer are a winning combination. As it is, the excellent beats for this album serve instead to camouflague rather than complement fifty's rapping. He is so limited lyrically that maybe this is the best he can hope for. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I love this collection of songs. There is something about this album that feels unexpectedly nostalgic yet fresh at the same time. Wonderfully infectious melodies, nice grooves and of course the remarkable voice.<br /><br />OK. So there was a lot of hype surrounding the release of this CD. It seems that Mariah was everywhere.<br /><br /> Just forget the hype and give it a listen.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the song Joyride and the awful cover photo, \\"Mimi's\\" a keeper.
0743454537|3.0|Would you live in hell to save one that you love? That's essentially the question being asked of Anna Fitzgerald in My Sister's Keeper, a novel by Jodi Picoult. Anna is the younger sister of Kate Fitzgerald, who has a rare form of lukemia. Kate was diagnosed when she was young, and had very little chance of living much longer. Sara (their mother) was incredibly and understandably distressed. You don't take news like this lightly. <br /> <br />My Sister's Keeper explores the destruction of a family, and whether or not that family could ever heal. Anna doesn't want to give up her kidney. Her mother insists on it. The solution? Anna finds a lawyer and sues her family for medical emancipation. How would you react?  <br /> <br />It's a difficult book, full of emotion, moral dilemma, and sorrow. Would you give up your life to save your sibling? And no, I don't mean taking a bullet for them or dying or anything easy like that. I mean giving up all your time and stopping everything at the drop of a hat to make a trip to the hospital and get stabbed repeatedly with needles of varying size. Giving blood, bone marrow, or even a kidney. The world of the Fitzgeralds revolves around Kate's health. When she goes into relapse, everything is dropped, be it a holiday, a birthday, or even Christmas. Everything comes second. <br /> <br />Including Anna.
0812550706|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" is a hard sci-fi novel that explores, among other things, the importance of leadership and strategy in warfare and the practical challenges posed by war in free space. After successfully repelling two alien invasions thanks to superior leadership from legendary general Mazer Rackham, Earth sets up a Battle School to train the next generation of space commanders, in preparation for an anticipated Third Invasion. The training is tough and begins at a young age, forcing potential commanders to grow up too quickly.    Enter young Ender Wiggin, the novel's protagonist. Ender quickly became one of my favorite heroes in popular literature. He's smart and sensitive, but don't let that fool you. He thinks like a strategist, he plays to win, and he's willing to stand up for himself.    \\"Ender's Game\\" is very difficult to put down. It's really interesting to see Ender's thought processes as he overcomes both the grueling training and the Third Invasion, against impossible odds. I definitely plan on reading the rest of the Ender saga. Highly recommended for ANYONE, not just sci-fi addicts.

0380789019|5.0|I read this book in two sittings, and the only reason I didn't read it in one is because I had to go to work before I had finished it. It was a fun book, a fairly light read in my opinion, but something that I enjoyed.<br /><br />The one issue that I had with this book is the descriptions. Some of the descriptions were very detailed, like of the floating market, but some of them, particularly the tube stations and trains, weren't as detailed, and that made it harder for me to imagine those things. Also, a lot of the buildings weren't described too well. I don't think it was something intentional on Gaiman's part, just that he knows those buildings and tube tunnels and trains very well, and so he assumes unconsciously that everyone else does too. Unfortunately, that's not true.<br /><br />I suppose I could have done some research online and found pictures, but I don't like stopping in the middle of something to do that, especially when I'm curled up in bed all warm and comfortable. Getting up to figure out what a building looks like isn't a high priority.<br /><br />Still, it didn't distract from the book too much. I actually find it hard to believe that I'm complaining about the lack of descriptions, because I'd much rather have plot than description, but you do need some, and I don't think that some areas quite got there.<br /><br />Other areas, however, were wonderfully described and places like the floating market and Down Street became the real stars of the book.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about the book was the characterization. The people from London Above were very one-dimensional (except Richard), but the people from London Below weren't, even the ones who were only met briefly. They all had their little quirks and idiosyncrasies that made them who they were, and made them denizens of London Below.<br /><br />I especially liked how, except for Croup and Vandemar, you couldn't really tell until the end (and sometimes not even then) who was a \\"good guy\\" and who was a \\"bad guy\\". Everyone seemed flawed, and everyone was suspect (to me at least) at some point in the book. Even those people who were obviously trying to help Richard and Door weren't very altruistic in their motives. Everyone wanted something before they would do anything at all and then the methods that they used to accomplish supposedly good things weren't always the most moral way to do them. Even after finishing the book, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to feel about some of the characters.<br /><br />Croup and Vandemar, however, were delightful villains. You knew that anyone who would employ them had to be a terrible being, but since it wasn't made known until almost the end of the book who that was, you mostly focused on them and their devilishly creative and painfully fun ways of maiming, torturing and killing. They contrasted perfectly-Croup's tendency to appreciate the finer things in life (though not the way most people appreciate them) and his excess verbiage set off Vandemar's impatience, silence, and need for action wonderfully.<br /><br />This isn't a book that I would read for plot alone, because the plot itself isn't that strong. This isn't to say that it wasn't a good plot, because it was, but the places and the characters stole the show. If the imaginary people and places that Gaiman created hadn't been so vibrant and entertaining, I think the book might have fallen through the same cracks that lead to London Below.<br /><br />Still, the plot was engaging enough to keep me interested, I'm just not sure how much I would have enjoyed the book if it hadn't been for the people and places in it.<br /><br />As I read the book, I felt more and more like Richard did-that the world of London Below was more real than London Above. It was a different world, and one that I wouldn't want to live in, but despite the darkness and dankness and impossible magic, it seemed more alive and more real than London Above. It almost seemed that the reason the people of London Above couldn't see the people of London Below unless they were directly addressed was that they were looking so hard at what they wanted to be there that really wasn't, they couldn't see what really was there.<br /><br />Maybe we all do that sometimes.eemed that the reason the people of London Above couldn't see the people of London Below unless they were directly addressed was that they were looking so hard at what they wanted to be there that really wasn't, they couldn't see what really was there. <br /> <br />Maybe we all do that sometimes.
B000002N2N|5.0|Just getting into the Ramones? Instead of picking up a greatest hits comp (after which you will have no need once you buy the actual studio albums), and pick up the live recording, sort of a \\"Greatest Hits of the Early Years Live\\" disc. After \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" and \\"Live at Fulsom\\", this is the best live recording I have heard. A must buy for Ramones fans and for fans of rock 'n' roll in general, this being the second best album of the bruthas after \\"Rocket to Russia\\". The best live albums are the ones that make you feel the energy of the show, the ones that make you wish you had been there. This manages to fall into both categories.
0393057658|4.0|This is a great book for baseball fans, or for anyone who loves a good underdog story.  If you're the latter, you'll find yourself rooting for the Oakland Athletics as they march towards the playoffs with a $40 million payroll, one of the lowest in the leagues and less than a quarter of what the Yankees spend on their roster.  The fascinating thing about this sports book is that most of the action takes place in the GM's office, not on the field.  But that doesn't make it any less exciting.  Reading the play-by-play of how Billy Beane orchestrates a deal for an undervalued minor league prospect can be just as gripping as a bottom-of-the-ninth playoff situation.<br /><br />What is really fascinating about this book is the notion that you can analyze the game without ever watching it, that the value of a player can be found in the box scores without ever seeing him play.  And there is something truly satisfying, something so American, about the notion that spending lots of money doesn't necessarily guarantee success.  In this book the little guy comes out ahead, or at least has a fighting chance.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|when I picked up this album- I didnt really know what to expect. <br />I wasn't looking for anything real heavy, hate filled or anything like that. <br />However, even if you never heard of Slipknot before- This album is their best for non-hardcore fans. <br /> <br />My favorites on this CD are: <br />The Blister Exists <br />Duality <br />The Nameless <br />Pulse of the Maggots <br />Before I Forget <br /> <br />This band doesnt just play, it sounds- <br />There is real music behind any of the lyrics- no matter what message is being proclaimed, if any. <br /> <br />Pick up this album, you won't be sorry.

B000069HKH|5.0|I went out and got this cd a few days ago, and I became immediately hooked to the wonderful atmosphere of the cd, its uplifting message, and its broad focus on all aspects of life.  This is the album that people call the \\"9/11\\" album, and yes, there is a lot of focus in the songs about bringing our country up after the horrific attacks, but there are no songs that are straightforward about that day.  Springsteen prefers to explore the cultural and relationship changes that came after, and tries to reach out to as many people as possible.  THe music is the most powerful and evocative he has ever created, and appears stunningly in songs like \\"my city of ruins\\" and \\"empty sky.\\"  This is a mature and sound album from a man who personifies a lot of the conflict and the heart of American culture. A \\"cash in on 9/11\\" it is most definitely not; I see no possible way that someone could cash in on something so terrible (in any country, not just the U.S.  these types of disasters happen regularly in less fortunate countries).  I personally recommend that the new fan gets Greatest Hits, and then they should get this album.  I am sure it is the best thing he has ever made, and certainly the most mature.  I hope it is remembered as a classic album in future years. <br /> <br />Now about all those one star reviews: <br /> <br />I think the people who come on this site are just mean spirited yokels (notice most of them are from the south, no?) and hey guys, I dig music down there (Skynyrd, Allman Bros, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams and the like) I find you lot to be incredibly misguided in you lambasting of this album.  For one thing, Bruce writes extremely intelligently and truthfully about the tragedy, as did many other people at this time.  But only Bruce gets accused of a \\"cash in\\" by you guys? that seems pretty unfair, in my view.  Also, Springsteen has designed his music so that it reaches out to everyone, and is not exclusive to certain areas.  You guys are all mean spirited.Don't lead normal people to get misguided impressions of the fabulous music on this cd.
B0002EXH4K|1.0|I was excited when Dave Mustaine said he was going to remaster Megadeth's back catalogue... I didn't know he was going to remix it too.  The remasters off Capitol Punishment sound good, here Mustaine decided to remix and play with the master tapes, creating a completely different sound to the original.  The first major problem is the smooth and intermingledness of the album as now it lacks that distinct almost cyborg-metal sound that the original had.  The extras aren't that special, just a couple of Japanese extra tracks and demos, and the demos are not that special.  While it would have been interesting to have seen an evolution of the songs, in the end we have a version that sounded like it the version before they recorded the album instead of a really early version.  In the end, stick to the originals, this doesn't offer anything new... just different and not better.
B000003S09|5.0|this is an album you either love or hate, and I happen to enjoy it a lot.  It is an underrated classic of prog rock, a genre that has been despised over the years.  The powerful opener is heavy metal before heavy metal existed, and the control of the arrangement and vocal distortion is just stunning.  The rest of the album is mellower, but no less powerful.  If you like Rush and Yes and similar bands, than you need this cd.  Read the other great reviews for more detail.
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge proves that Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips actually want to rock!!!  After the third Creed album, you could tell that Stapp was having too much say in their music.  Creed's music was becoming too watered down, and Stapp was struggling to make radio friendly songs!  With that being said, Alter Bridge approaches their music in a more traditional fashion than Creed did.  How's that?  Well, Myles Kennedy (the lead vocalist) can actually sing, and the band plays great quality, modern, hard rock!  Tremonti's guitar solos are nothing short of impressive, and adding some traditional metal accents in for good measure!  Those of you that grew up with 80's metal know what I'm referring to.  For those of you that didn't, well listen to some Dio, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Queesryche, and get back to me!  As for Phillips, he's not hidden in the background and you can actually tell he can play!  He's a very impressive drummer, but I haven't realized it until One Day Remains!  On another note, welcome back Brian Marshall!  You never realize how much a great bassist puts into the music, until he leaves a band!  Overall, if you want a great mixture of modern and traditional hard rock, then buy Alter Bridge's debut, One Day Remains!  It's well worth the brand new price!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A magnificent political documentary which explores the retrospectives and political hindsights of Robert S. McNamara who, in years gone by, was the Rumsfeld of the Vietnam War. Speaking candidly about the lessons he's learned from his experiences of war, McNamara shares his controversial past with us, including a frank discussion about his role in the planning of the WWII firebombing of Japanese cities in order to maximise their destructive efficiency. In one night alone we are told that McNamara's B-29 bomber group burned to death 100,000 men, women and children in downtown Tokyo. Most of this history, plus other political insights on the Cuban Missile Crisis and LBJ's now released tape recordings on the Vietnam War was news to me and I felt that McNamara's war lessons and hindsights should never be underestimated or dismissed. As a matter of fact, there were many instances when the war footage was rolling and McNamara was speaking about the lessons from his life, I found myself wondering just how much wisdom have today's political leaders acquired from studying war failures from America's past? My conclusion having watched the Fog of War is, as you might expect, very little. The faces and the suits have all changed from Washington in the sixties, but the war rhetoric is still very much the same today as it was back then. This is a powerful political documentary and a valuable history lesson and I recommend that you buy it, watch it and Study The Past.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Wow...I just have to say I absolutely love this cd.  Every song is just wonderful.  From the saucy \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" to country-esque \\"Home,\\" this cd has a little bit of everything.   <br /> <br />Now for those of you who like the song \\"Home,\\" I must warn you.  That is the only song on the entire cd that sounds country/pop.  The rest of the cd is mellow jazzy tunes.  So, if you're into \\"Home,\\" I would check out the rest of the cd before you decide to buy the whole cd.  But you won't be upset if you buy it!   <br /> <br />I really like calming music with good lyrics, and this cd does it perfectly.  I can listen to the entire cd through and through on my long trip home every weekend.  And most of you can agree that you normally can't listen to an entire cd from start to finish.  CD's these days just don't have great songs from beginning to end.  But Michael Buble does it - and then some.  I love the mellow, soothing sound of his voice.  It's relaxing.  Perfect for an outside bbq or a pool party.  It really feels like summer when I listen to this cd.   <br /> <br />Buy this cd, you'll love it and get hooked!!
B000002UAU|5.0|sgt peppers was so good and was so succesful that EMI did not feel the need to release singles off it.anyways anybody who recommends lousy crap like N'SYNC,BACKSTREET BOYS and BLINK 182 over the BEATLES has to have some serious brain damage and mental retardation.this album is a masterpiece.rush to your record store and buy it.
B00066N8JS|5.0|This re-release of TDS is like listening to the album again for the first time. The excess of this type of thing might lead you to believe it's just a marketing gimmick, but that is simply not the case here. Of course, if anyone could perfect something that was already perfected, it's Trent Reznor. <br />First of all, the 13-track bonus disc is reason enough to buy this deluxe edition for any NIN fan since it has three previously unreleased demos. That might sound like peanuts to fans of any other band, but NIN fans know that on the rare occasion you get to hear something you've never heard before from Mr. Reznor, you cherish it. Also contained within are a handful of the best remixes from the singles and the &quot;Further Down The Spiral&quot; versions which are nice to have on one disc. Then you have the Joy Division cover &quot;Dead Souls&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot; from The Crow and the Natural Born Killers soundtracks, respectively. Last but not least is the Soft Cell cover, &quot;Memorabilia&quot; which is an excellent track and it sounds fantastic here. <br />Getting on to the good stuff, the album itself is a whole new listening experience. Everything feels more alive, more crisp, more precise than it did before. When you've listened to The Downward Spiral as much as the average NIN fan does, you start to pick up on things you never noticed the first 50 times you heard the song. Well that is what the deluxe edition feels like. Hearing new things all over again, letting your senses soak up the layers upon layers of... well, noise. There was a lot of it to begin with, and here it just becomes even more evident, and beautiful. You can never truly appreciate the artestry and brilliance put into the masterpieces which are Nine Inch Nails albums, until you hear them multiple times. That said, we are now able to let it happen all over again. <br />Reznor couldn't have marked the 10-year anniversary of The Downward Spiral any better, and it is definitely a must havefor any Nine Inch Nails fan, or someone who just never owned the album in the first place. It sounds great even if you don't own an SACD player or have 5.1 surround sound. Highly recommended.
B000089RVR|5.0|This compact disc titled, \\"Life for Rent\\" by Dido takes you on a journey through the greatness of life. It's music takes you through humility, light, and healing.     The music is also wonderful dance music. You will listen to this compact disc many times and never be be tired of it. It's music that you will probably love for the rest of you life. It is music that I will remember for a long time.
B000002GQL|5.0|SEVENTH SOJOURN is yet another classic album by the Moody Blues. On this one, the band seem to be questioning their status as professional musicians and wondering if they'll lose touch with reality, even as they turn in the beautiful love songs \\"New Horizons\\" and \\"For My Lady.\\" This album is relevant to a lot of ordinary people whose reality focus has been affected by the Internet and fantasy TV, and is a must-own for anyone interested in progressive rock.
B0000024SI|5.0|It's not possible for me to pick ONE Dylan album as his \\"best\\", because he's been through so many phases, but this one seems to me to be not only one of his best but one of the best albums of any artist.  (Another one of my favorites is \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".)  Classics such as \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" set the pace for the genre of \\"you'll get yours\\" rock that was not necessarily from a love song perspective; \\"Tombstone Blues\\" is a fantastic blues-rock song where  the lyrics could mean just about anything.  My favorite song is one of the best hard rock/hard blues songs of all time, \\"Ballad of A Thin Man\\", evokes (in my mind) someone who encounters a situation not of the subject's making, and the dark lyrics and barren chords lend the song a spooky feeling that has a very personal image to me. It is this song, I believe, that John Lennon refers to in \\"Yer Blues\\" when he says \\"Feel so suicidal, just like Dylan's Mr. Jones\\".  I also particularly like the slightly out-of-tune guitar on \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\". <br /> <br />Among all of Dylan's many albums, understandably, there will be some \\"lesser lights\\".  But he was, most of the time, true to himself in a way that most other  artists  can only pretend to.  At his best, Dylan is a lyricist and songwriter without peer, and \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" shows some of his best songs with minimal instrumental distraction.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Cape Fear is one of the best movies in the world! I absolutly love it! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys revenge movies, because this is the best revenge movie ever!

0451526384|3.0|Persuasion is a romance book.  The story took place in the 19th century in Kellynch hall.  Anne and Captain Wentworth was in love.  Anne's father didn't wanted Anne to married to Captain Wentworth because of the social class.  Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returned having made his name and fortune with the British Navy, and its now his turn to reject her.  Anne still love Captain Wentworth but her father persuaded her not to married the man of not having good money.  The three main characters of Persuasion is Anne Elliot, Captain Wentworth, and Sir Walter Elliot. The theme was Social mobility.  Sir Walter objects to letting the house to an admiral because the navy offends his two most valued traits. <br /> Persuasion is for teenagers to adults type of audience.  The romance go toward older people.  This is a type of book for people who are mature.  People who are older would love this book more than a younger person because the book is a classical book.  Persuasion was a very appealing book.  The was very awkward.  They should change the ending because it sound crazy.  They should made it sound like they got married instead of them engaged.  It was a good book because it show how someone was persuaded to not married someone.  Anne was in the world because the person she love , she couldn't get married to him.  The story shows how much trails they had to go through to get together.  Persuasion is considered to be a classic because it show how people got married in the 19th Century.  The 19th Century romance was beautiful.  It is also considered a classic because they married their cousins a lot in this story, they didn't mind if they married their cousin.  Now these days, that crazy to married your cousin.  I really recommend this book to people who like to read literature.  So I believed that adults should read this more because they would be interested in it.  I also recommend for people who love to read books.  I rate this book \\"Persuasion\\" a three star becuause the ending was not good, they should change the ending.  Everything else was about the book was good.   <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|I agree completely with the review below. This album is so amazing and tool are some bloody great musicians.  <br />The person who gave this album 1 star should really go back to listening to their pop or soft rock music or whatever it is they listen to, because they obviously don't listen to this type of music. So how dare they say this album is only worthy of 1 star?? IT'S AMAZING!! I think it's a real stirrer of emotions .. <br />If you like hard rock/metal buy this!!!!

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Unlike so many albums worshipped by indie sycophants, the Arcade Fire's Funeral is original, memorable, and very, very musical.  Warning to scenesters: listening to this isn't going to make you look cool at all.  This is just plain great, well-written, orchestral indie rock 'n' roll.  Not exactly Wolf Eyes or Xiu Xiu.<br /><br />The record has a very epic, emotional feel to it.  Most of the songs build up to a cathartic crescendo that is often predictable, but nevertheless awesome.  The vocal melodies are incredibly strong and the backing instrumentation (including strings, glockenspiels, accordions, horns, etc.) is possibly the best of its kind since Neutral Milk Hotel.  The songs are definitely distinct from one another, but weave a record that works marvelously as a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Funeral is a testament to the power of excellent composition.  There are no gimmicks, no irony, and nothing trying to make the record more than it actually is.  These are simply beautifully written songs that are destined to be cherished and adored by true lovers of music.  I'm keeping this review short because the record is meant to be listened to and enjoyed to the fullest, not scrutinized by amateur reviewers like myself.  Bad press has already turned too many off to an amazing album.  Pick it up and experience it for yourself.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I had high hope for this movie - all of my favorite characters of novels being hunted by Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine in X-men).<br /><br />However, from the star this movie is just plain silly. It relies completely on computer technology but the story is lost. There is no character development and no decent interactions. There are not even any decent one-liners!<br /><br />Save your money from something much better - say \\"Dude, Where'w My Car.\\" That movie was one of my worst rated films, but then came Van Helsing.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", the 2nd movie in the trilogy:  I was disappointed and confused but I still think it's worth watching just for the action and special effects.  It doesn't have the same originality, creativity, intensity, passion and excitement as the 1st and original movie in the Matrix trilogy, but you really need to be a true die-hard Matrix fan to watch the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies in this trilogy, in my opinion to truly enjoy them.  I would not have bought the DVDs:  \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" or \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" if I had watched them BEFORE I bought them - (I wish I had just rented them instead).  I never regretted buying the 1st and original movie:  \\"The Matrix\\" on DVD, (which I consider to be a masterpiece). <br /> <br />My Rating:  B-
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I'm trying to think of another movie that I could put on the same list as GLADIATOR. Maybe Amadeus. As with Amadeus, Gladiator's sound track has no equal. When you take films like these and add scores that have no equals you get movies that stand alone on top of a small list. Gladiator is the world's GREATEST movie ever made!
B00005JMCN|4.0|I liked this movie but I was disappointed also.  I have seen a lot of very well made documentaries on Seabiscuit and one in particular that I saw on PBS just before this film was released on DVD.  So, I couldn't wait to see the movie.  The documentary I saw was actually more entertaining than this movie and had that \\"edge of your seat\\" suspense that the movie lacked.  The documentary on PBS contained a lot of exciting horse races that Seabiscuit was in and the narration and story was very well made.  Also, I found the narration in the MOVIE to be out of place - the movie didn't need it.  It's a great story but it was a bit lackluster at times.  The acting and cinematography was very good.  I wonder if my review and rating of this movie would have been different if I had not seen all those great documentaries on Seabiscuit before I watched the DVD - I may have had a better reaction to the film.  Maybe time will change my rating to a higher grade.  It still was entertaining and I recommend this movie to all.  My rating:  B+
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is one of the best animated films of all time. <br /> <br />Wait, wait - not so fast. That's a loaded statement, and we have to justify it, don't we? So let's go ahead and do just that. <br /> <br />This is Miyazaki's most polished, flawless work. You could say that this is an artifact of the fact that it takes less chances than his other full-length films, that it is more restrained and less complex, but that simply wouldn't be true. Porco is as complex a character as Miyakazi has ever made, and far less typical than most characters he creates. Let's face it, the man has certain archetypes he likes, and he sticks to them like glue: your outwardly brave yet inwardly vulnerable female lead (i.e. Fio, Sophie (wait for Howl's Moving Castle), Chihiro, Mononoke, Sheeta, or just about any other Miyazaki female lead), the standard enigmatic noble leading man (Pazu, Haku), the kindly weird old guy, the irate old witch that is morally redeemed throughout the story, and many others besides. <br /> <br />Porco is none of these. He's completely unique, and watching him interact with everyone around him is truly remarkable. He's the most well-rounded and fleshed-out character that Miyazaki has ever produced. The supporting cast is firmly archetypical, but we can forgive him for that. <br /> <br />The story is simple, but flawless. It isn't overly convoluted as it is in Mononoke, nor is it as arbitrarily and unsatisfyingly resolved as it is in Spirited Away. The tension arc throught the film is wonderfully well thought out. It starts on a high note, slightly silly, then settles into a stylish, melancholy and surreal vibe that lasts for a good half of the film. In the end, action picks up and some of the silliness comes back, but after having sat though the wonderfully surreal middle segment, you're more pre-disposed to watch it at face value, and it's inherent silliness is less irksome. The ending itself is wonderfully melancholy, resolving (some of) the plot yet leaving thetension hanging in the air. The only other Miyazaki feature that has this flawless a story-line is Castle in the Sky, but it cannot touch the nuance and emotional complexity of this film. The historical setting provides a necessary realistic contrast to the deeply romaticised characters and events in the movie, and adds a degree of unsettling tension to the atmosphere. <br /> <br />The visuals are gorgeous. Rumour has it that three times as much money was spent on this as was on Castle in the Sky, it's direct predecessor - and it shows. The detail in every frame is stunning, and the emotion and nuance in character expression is second to none. The movie was technically far ahead of it's time, and still looks fresh today, despite competition from CGI. Disney may have it's terapixel rendering pipelines and billions of polygons, but they have not come even close to capturing the freshness and liveliness that Miyazaki infuses his characters with, nor do they have anywhere near his visual imagination. The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is wonderful as always, and Gina's beautiful ballad is a melodic centerpiece of the film. <br /> <br />This is a film that is deeply humanistic yet never overly sappy and emotional. It is dynamic and engaging while being wonderfully subtle and nuanced. It is simple, yet never simplified. It offers social commentary, yet doesn't preach. It is moralistic, yet not moralizing. And it's charming as all hell. Many, many scenes will remain in your memory forever. Porco's story (you'll have to see the film to know what I'm talking about) is a stunning, surreal, typical Miyazaki moment, and is one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema (I'm not kidding). <br /> <br />So, are you going to enjoy this movie? Well, that depends. If you like everything distilled into clear, concise explanations, with no moral trickery on the part of the author, then this probably won't be your cup of tea. If \\"what happens\\" is your measure of a film's, or a story's worth, then this will probably fall short. If you can't appreciate subtle humour, then this may seem boring. If, however, you want charm, wit, grace, and refinement bundled together with dynamic action and a healthy dose of surrealism, then meet your new Holy Grail. And if you think that animation is still chiefly family entertainment, then grow a few brain cells. Animation allows us to express what conventional live-action cinema cannot (though with the advent of CGI, this may not be true for much longer). <br /> <br />This is one of the best animated films of all time. <br /> <br />P.S. Howl's Moving Castle is worth the wait. It's excellent. If you like the more surreal direction in which Miyazaki was going in Spirited Away, well, he goes further in that direction. Much, much further... but that's for another review! <br /> <br />P.P.S. My review applies to the subtitled version. I hate english dubs, and you should too. The emotion and vocal delivery of the original Japanese soundtrack is a vital element in watching any Japanese animated film. In general, it's a good idea to watch any foreign movie in it's original language. <br /> <br />I hope I've been helpful. If I seem overly exuberant and full of superlatives, that it because this is a film that's worth being superlative about. Treasure it.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|\\"The Matrix Revolutions\\", the 3rd and final movie in the trilogy:  I was very disappointed by the ending and felt betrayed - I didn't think they gave us a worthy ending to this trilogy.  But again, I gave it a good rating because of the action and special effects and also because I know that most people won't watch the 2nd or 3rd movie of the Matrix trilogy without watching and liking the 1st movie, (The Matrix).  In other words, if you didn't like \\"The Matrix\\", you sure as heck aren't going to like the 2nd or 3rd movie.  But if you liked \\"The Matrix\\", you may like the sequels but have mixed feelings about them like I did.  Also, the acting in \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" wasn't very good.  The actors seemed wooden, stiff and robotic, almost like they were machines instead of humans. <br /> <br />I have to admit that if I had seen these 2 sequels, I would not have bought the DVDs.  I bought them without seeing the movies first.  I never regretted buying \\"The Matrix\\" because it is an outstanding film and can be watched on its own. <br /> <br />I haven't listened to the commentary track on any of the DVDs yet - Maybe it will help with some of my questions.  But there is nothing that anybody can say to fix the ending of the last movie, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\".  I don't get it.  What happened to Neo?  It just didn't make any sense.  :-( <br />My rating:  B-
B00005JMYI|1.0|I had heard the negative reviews, but I went into this with an open mind and no expectations. I guess if I had to review it in one sentence it would be:<br /><br />I didn't laugh once.<br /><br />I'm not even all that sure why it wasn't funny. It had Will Ferrell, a potentially funny story, and lots of good supporting actors and cameos. And yet, not even a chuckle.<br /><br />*flush*<br /><br />What was that? Christina Applegate's \\"illustrious\\" career going down the toilet.
630469878X|5.0|I always liked this movie a lot.  Recently, this movie came on TV and I had not seen it in a long time.  I was blown away by it.  I liked it even more than the last time I saw it.  This is an excellent movie.  It's a female \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" (1969).  I see some similarities like vivid characterizations, chemistry between stars, poignant tragicomedy, drama, and action.  I highly recommend this movie!  My rating:  A
B0007GAERG|3.0|Mimi is a name used for children in Spanish cultures when they are tired.  I think Maybe Mariah needs a nap...?  I think there are a few good songs on this album, I enjoyed Shake it off very much and maybe two or three others that really caught my ear, but I don't think it is at all up to her usual standard (not including Glitter).  But I would buy it again if I lost the C.D.  It's an easy listen... x x x.  p.s... why would anyone trust a review on Mariah Carey written by someone with the name Heavy Metal??? Go figure...
B0001Z52RU|4.0|You need to realize that the story is NOT plausible and just get over that problem, then sit back and enjoy the ride this movie takes you on.  I love the concept of \\"what if I could go back in time with the brain and wisdom I have now and change things that happened, things I did or I said, etc.\\"  I have had these thoughts throughout my life and this movie really touched me in a deep way.  Be warned though.  This movie is not for everyone and especially people that are upset by violence or cruelty.  This is the most inventive and exciting movie that came out in 2004, in my opinion.    I saw the \\"Director's Cut\\" of this movie and NOT the original theatrical version.  I rented it through Netflix and they sent me one of those \\"rental only\\" type discs and it did not have the original theatrical version on the flip side of the disc.  I was able to view the alternate ending (theatrical) by using an \\"Infinifilm\\" popup and going to the chapter where it is located.  In case anybody is a member of Netflix, this information will be nice to know.  I found out about it by reading comments on the IMDb website.  I was completely unaware there was a totally different ending (theatrical version).  I have no idea if my rating of this movie would be different on the original theatrical version.  I did read several comments on the IMDb website and a lot of people preferred the original ending to the Director's Cut version.  But I did read some that preferred the Director's Cut to the original and some that liked both.  Until I see the theatrical version in full, I can't really know which one I like better.  But both endings are totally different.
B0002X314C|5.0|Reading some of these reviews I see a lot of people say that this CD is boring--I think its quite the contrary. This Cd, however, is not for people who like younger, teen, poppish type music. This CD is grown. He's the type of artist you either hate or love to death bcuz his voice is so unique. So it would probably be best to listen to this yourself before you buy it but if your a real fan--he won't dissapoint. My fav. on this one is \\"So High\\"--it's got to be one of the best songs on the CD.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I'll try to make this review short but NOT sweet: <br /> <br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two Americans in Tokyo, Japan.  They are bored, somewhat depressed and unable to sleep.  They meet and become friends.  That's basically it.  The dialogue is boring.  The acting is boring.  The plot is boring.  The scenery of Japan is interesting to look at.  There were some (few) funny situations and lines in the movie but not enough to recommend this movie.  Scarlett Johansson does a good acting job with her character with what little she has to work with (lack of great dialogue and script).  But Bill Murray is NOT a good actor.  Bill Murray played himself in this movie.  How anybody could think he deserved to win a Golden Globe, be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor is beyond my comprehension.  Bill Murray should not be rewarded for playing himself in a movie.  The movie did not deserve to be nominated for Best Picture (Academy Award) and did not deserve to win Best Comedy (Golden Globe).  What happened to the film industry?  Have they lost touch with reality?  I actually had to force myself to finish watching this movie and could not wait until it was over.  That's not a good sign.  If you are the \\"arty\\" (art-house) type, you will probably like this movie.  But if you are an average/mainstream movie viewer, you probably won't like this movie unless you like boring, quirky films.  I am shocked that this movie has been given so much praise and rave reviews from a lot of critics.  I guess that's why I like this website because I think it can be a more accurate viewpoint for people with all kinds of different tastes. <br /> <br />Just because a movie is considered a work of \\"art\\" doesn't mean it is appealing in any way or interesting enough to be a movie. It seems to me that this is becoming a trend now to make movies without anything really interesting going on.  It should at LEAST be interesting and maybe have something to say or have an impact on you in some way that you can't forget it.  I guess I put a lot of importance on a movie being interesting or entertaining so that I don't fall asleep.  Entertainment value is definitely very subjective and everybody has his or her own tastes.  I think it is VERY IMPORTANT to any movie to be interesting or entertaining enough that you would actually want to watch the movie again sometime.  I think most people would agree with me too.  This movie is NOT a great movie; not even a good movie.  Someone would have to pay me to watch this boring and irritating movie again.  I'd have to think about how much I'd charge. <br /> <br />My rating:  D
B00005JLD4|5.0|I looked at this film about a year ago and recommended it to alot of my friends and they all felt, me included that it was an excellent film.  <br /> <br />Not only was it captivating, but it was also very touching as well as educational.  The journey the girls had to endure, the scenery and the interview at the end gave credibility to this story.   <br /> <br />This is a must see for students studing civil liberties in high school and college. <br /> <br />Upon reading another review, it was mentioned that the story was not true and aborigines were not forced into these racists camps but they went voluntarily and the story is a fabrication.  The reviewer went so far as to post a website source written by none other - Andrew Bolt - of the Herald Sun which by the way is a subsidiary of Fox News Corp. This webiste offers a very critical view of the movie as being a fake but it is just an opinion.  If you're looking for facts, go to the australian government website and do your own research. <br /> <br />Like I mentioned previously, it's an excellent film and I highly recommend it. <br />  <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|My opinion: The best music made in the new millenium. The end
B00079HZUM|5.0|As a non-English native speaker, it is difficult for me to express my enthusiasm for this magnificent movie - especially since it deals with one of the richest, unique elements of English culture - the world of Shakespeare. <br />But I'll try, because the movie is just extraordinary.  <br /> <br />Stage Beauty is conceived much like a play by Shakespeare, with its layers of complexity behind the apparent simplicity of its powerful story, its well-crafted characters, and its underlying themes (interactions between genders, definition and pursuit of Excellence, disorder versus order). In fact, it is highly reminiscent of Othello in its central themes - and, not surprisingly, Othello the play is at the heart of the movie.  <br /> <br />The performance of the actors is simply stunning - they effortlessly take viewers from one emotion to the next; and watching them portray players who in turn play roles (of their own gender or not) is an absolute delight.  <br /> <br />However, acting skills are enablers - what really allows the cast to deliver such a compelling performance is the movie's overall structure, and the consistent way in which it deals with its core themes. In fact, the movie progresses in such an irresistible way that it culminates with a man and a woman simply greeting each other before a rehearsal - the masculine Excellence and the feminine Excellence, finally defined, and facing each other at last - after a period of disorder and conflicts. <br /> <br />An absolute jewel. <br />
B0002SROSQ|4.0|This is the first studio album by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds I've bought; the other was \\"The Best of...\\" which I think is an excellent introduction to newcomers, it's one retrospective album that really gives a great overview to the band's music. (In fact the brooding, apocalyptic \\"Red Right Hand\\" is reason enough to own that album.) <br /> <br />This release again revisits Cave's themes of love, faith, God, beauty, and torment spread out over 17 tracks on two albums packaged as one. I love double albums especially by talented artists who have the capability to present this much material with great lyrics and music that holds one's attention.  <br /> <br />After a few listenings I was instantly hooked by the songs on \\"Abbatoir Blues\\" like \\"Nature Boy\\" (one of Cave's best) that includes the lyrics:  <br /> <br />\\"I was walking around the flower show like a leper <br />Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria <br />When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair <br />Up against the pink and purple wisteria\\"  <br /> <br />I just think the way the lyrics fit in with the pacing of the music on that song is brilliant; the title track's simplicity with those two dramatic piano chords, the lyrically well-written \\"Cannibal's Hymn\\", and the bizarre and unsettling \\"Fable of the Brown Ape\\". No one can tell eerie stories quite like him. This one reminds me a little of one of his earlier favorites of mine, \\"The Carny\\".   <br /> <br />But the more I hear of the second collection \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" I'm finding it almost more enjoyable even though for the most part the music is pretty subtle and mellow. \\"Breathless\\" is an exercise in pastoral folk, one of Cave's more light-hearted tunes, while \\"Supernaturally\\" has enough drama and bite with a rousing chorus...\\"Spell\\"    touches on a similar theme as \\"Breathless\\", where Cave could be singing to either a human loved one or a supreme deity, if you really read the lyrics. Throughout, even though the songs can be seen as pretty heavy musically and lyrically, Cave periodically injects humor here and there as in \\"Lyre of Orpheus\\", where Orpheus is causing so much havoc with his instrument in this world so he is banished to Hell   . <br /> <br />Bonus points for the elegant but simple packaging job. With all of the online music trends and CD burning going on, it's only a matter of time before the thoughtful packaging of CDs sadly becomes a thing of the past. <br /> <br />I can't wait to get some more of Nick Cave's releases real soon, in particular, \\"No More Shall We Part\\" and The Boatman's Call\\". <br />
0375507256|4.0|the diary of the 19th cent. american scribbler and the ghastly ordeal of tim cavendish and the mystery of luisa rey sections are total triumphs--in the vein of Mitchell's supporter and master Mr William Goddam Boyd.  the sci-fi stuff sucks--skip it.  futuristic writing is for total ninnies, anyway.  david mitchell is a discovery.  he aint no Boyd, nor George Saunders neither, but he is pretty amusing/erudite.  the cove can spin a yarn...
B00030590I|4.0|This movie is getting overlooked due to \\"House of Flying Daggers,\\" but in my opinion it is right along side it, or more. There are few unconvincing aspects of the story, and romance is only part of the movie, rather than central, so you don't spend much time trying to convince yourself of what's happening. If you ever disliked Jet Li, this movie might make you change your mind. His motivation as the character here is easier to relate to than his past roles of beat-up-anyone-and-never-get-hit-even-once, especially at the end (Hope that doesn't spoil it). One downside is that it is hard to be convinced that the main character or \\"hero\\" isn't actually Emperor Qin, which would be a downside for those who've read the history books (IMO)...
B0007GAERG|2.0|I must say, I was very disappointed with this CD.  First of all, Mariah's voice sounds (to me) like she has lost those high notes she hit in her 1st. 3 albums.  In this album she does try something different & for this I give Mariah a lot of credit.  I just don't think this Hip Hop theme really fits Mariah's song writing. For one, Mariah doesn't have any rythm to get into this type of songs.  I love the idea of the video to the cover song but it's in slow motion to cover up Mariah's inability to get into it?
B000066NW0|4.0|I mean Avril has admitted a lot of times that she is not punk. It was the media who gave her that title of punk-girl and that's the problem with so many people who thinks Avril sucks because she is not punk but the truth is that Avril is a pop/rock artist, and she is talented. This album is a great debut for a 17-year-old female. Every song on 'Let Go' is a masterpiece', 'Complicated''I'm With You' 'Things I'll Never say'and 'My World' are amazing songs. The only dissapointing track is 'Sk8er Boi' i mean, i think this song is out of place but it was a top 10 hit. The reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 it's because 'Under My Skin' is a more mature album, with a much more deep writing and sound.  <br />'Let Go' is a pop Music classic, a pop masterpiece!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Yes, I'm sure you've read that tile like a million times when going through these reviews but it's true. My mind and spirit have truly been freed by this album. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" was exactly what I needed.

006028577X|5.0|Scrooge was a man whom lived in a small old house that at one time belonged to his departed business partner, Jacob Marley. Though he could meet the expense of the most expensive clothes available, he chose to dress in the fashion of a lower-class civilian. He worked in a counting house with only his clerk Bob Cratchit for business. Scrooge was a grumpy old man whom believed that Christmas is for rich people.  He also thinks that Christmas is also just a reason to miss work and get gifts to one another and also to exchange the gifts. Every time the Christmas holiday would come Scrooge would get the same feelings as the years before which are not very Christmas spirity. Most people respected his dislike for Christmas holidays, and continued to dislike him, despise him, even hate him.  He doesn't believe in all of the good cheer, happiness and charity that the season promotes, and he makes sure everyone knows how he feels about the Christmas spirit.  His money was what he lived by.  One night Scrooge was visited by his friend, which was Marley, who was also grumpy and cold as Scrooge was.  When Marley visited Scrooge, Marley told Scrooge that if he continues to be stingy and so selfishly he would continue with greed as his assemble.  He also tells Scrooge that three spirits will haunt him.  On Christmas Eve, Scrooge received three visits from three specific ghosts.  The ghost names where the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.  Those ghost showed him the true meaning of Christmas and the true meaning of his life.  They showed him his error in valuing money over people. Scrooge saw his long forgotten past, realizing all the good quality he had deserted, and all he had done to guide him where he was now. He saw his childhood, his grief and pleasure. He saw his relatives and acquaintances. He also saw himself turn from all these through his greed as his age progressed.   <br /> <br />
B00007J4SI|2.0|I was excited to purchase an almost complete set of Scriabin's piano works, and for the breath there is nothing else that compares to this album. The price is small considering you'll be getting 5 CD's of the majority of Scriabin's piano works. However, the scale is about all the CD set has in its favor. <br />The piano is horribly bright, sounding almost like a toy. Also, as the other revies mension, there is significant noise on the tracks because it was remastered from audio cassette. However, the noise is does not detract from the performance much and is more of a constant annoyance than an obstacle to hearing the playing. However, the playing isn't spectacular either. Ponti gets fairly sloppy at times (though, to be fair, Scriabin is very difficult to play). Also, I do not agree with his interpretations of many pieces (of course, that is purely personal preference whereas sloppy technique is not). <br />To summarize, the playing by many other pianists of Scrianbin is superior. If you only want one or two Scriabin songs and they happen to be famous, you can probably find them on a different CD. I would only but this set if one was looking for the complete works.
B00006JDVV|2.0|This plot didn't make a lot of sense.  We are told dragons have taken over the skies of earth, yet we hardly see any flying around.  I rented this because Gerard Butler is in it.  He has the best lines then gets killed off.  Christian Bale has an angry expression on his face for the entire movie, I bet he was sorry he signed the contract.  Matthew McConnaughy chews up the scenery with gusto, he looks like the only one having any fun.  If the dragons only eat ash, why do they chomp on people?  This is for hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fans only.
B0007RT9LW|1.0|If you're looking to buy this because it's \\"unrated\\" and you're expecting something edgier, sexier, or more violent than the original 2000 cut, don't bother -- the only reason it's \\"unrated\\" is that the studio didn't bother to submit it to the MPAA. <br /> <br />In other words, it's a marketing ploy.  Yes, this version is slightly different from the one previously released -- this one has all the deleted scenes re-inserted, so the film runs a few minutes longer.  But there's nothing in it that wouldn't get another PG-13 if they re-submitted it. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, and don't fall into this marketing ploy.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Goodness, there sure have been a lot of movies based on comic books coming out in the past few years. We've seen \\"Spiderman\\" and its sequel, \\"Elektra,\\" \\"Daredevil,\\" \\"Sin City,\\" \\"Hellboy,\\" \\"The Punisher,\\" and probably a few others I'm forgetting. Heck, we can expect to see new installments in the \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" franchises soon, too. Personally, I haven't seen any of the above listed films with the exception of the first Spiderman, and it's likely I won't see more than a couple of them any time soon. I'm not trying to bash comic books or anything like that, but for some reason I tend to shy away from films based on this medium. Why? I hear very bad things about many of these films, most of which involve complaints about how the films forego important things like plot and character development in favor of shock and awe special effects. If I remember correctly from my comic book reading days, most of the stories dealt heavily with superheroes faced with moral quandaries and personality problems that translated over into the real world. Not so in the movies. The emphasis here is on blowing stuff up and using the biggest CGI effects possible.<br /><br />There are exceptions: \\"Spiderman\\" did a good job focusing on the characters' problems. So did \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United.\\" I have seen these movies, and I liked all three of them. \\"X2,\\" however, is arguably the best of the lot. The film continues the story of the characters we saw in the first film--namely Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)--while adding a few new faces. After the X-Men saved the world in the first film, not much changed regarding human/mutant relations. Normal people still freak out whenever they see someone shape change, produce fire out of thin air, or any of the other assorted abilities common to mutants. The opening sequences of \\"X2\\" do little to alleviate such fears. An attack on the White House by a mutant with the ability to teleport (Nightcrawler, played effectively by Alan Cumming) nearly costs the president his life. The result is a crackdown on mutants everywhere with the resurrection of the dreaded Mutant Registration Act, a draconian measure that will severely restrict the activities of mutants everywhere.<br /><br />The man in charge of carrying out the new act is General William Stryker (deliciously evil Brian Cox), a man whose new mission allows him to carry out his own personal vendetta against Xavier and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. I won't spoil the reasons behind the vendetta, but his official mission sees him launch an attack against Xavier's school in order to round up the freaks. Unfortunately, he picked a bad time to make an appearance--Wolverine is back from his soul searching and is ready to kick some serious you know what. While he assists in salvaging what he can from the fiasco at Xavier's pad, the rest of the X-Men are out and about trying to track down the mutant responsible for the attack on the White House. If they can find this person, they reason, they might be able to head off the impending crackdown. Of course, their mission soon discovers that Stryker's fingerprints are all over the place. Too, Magneto manages to escape from his plastic prison and, with the oddly alluring Mystique at his side, throws a few wrenches into the whole process. By the time the movie comes to an end, we've seen the overall storyline advance amidst an avalanche of mind-blowing special effects including but not limited to huge tornados, rushing walls of water, and whipsaw quick fight sequences. Fun stuff!<br /><br />Heartfelt thanks should go to director Bryan Singer for masterfully balancing the action and CGI with numerous character driven arcs. It's great to see fights and mutant powers blasting away at everything in sight, don't get me wrong, but it's more interesting to see how the characters develop. And in that department Singer and company do a good job. The whole human versus mutant conflict receives fresh treatment, as does Wolverine's eternal struggle to understand who he is and how he came to be. The latter is probably the most intriguing element in the storyline due to its relevancy. Who among us hasn't struggled to understand our identity at some point in life? Of course, most of us haven't been the subject of government experimentation that grafted metal to our bones and wiped our memories clean in the process, but you get the idea. And while the movie simplifies that theme so even the densest dolts in the audience will catch on, it's still an almost universal human issue that resonates with all of us. CGI and character dynamics aside, \\"X2\\" is a lot of fun if for no other reason than checking out all the babes. Halle Berry (not a favorite of mine), Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and Kelly Hu provide more than enough eye candy for us older \\"kids\\" in the audience.<br /><br />\\"X2: X-Men United\\" has something for everyone. And check out the extras on the two-disc set! That's what I call a DVD! I won't waste time going over them in detail except to say that the sheer number of supplements guarantees a viewer can spend plenty of time exploring every aspect of this film's production process if he or she wishes to do so. If you haven't seen \\"X2\\" yet, prepare to be blown away. One hopes the next installment will surpass the previous two, but the absence of Singer behind the camera should cause some concerns. Oh well, even if the next one stinks we've still got these two great films to watch over and over again.eresting to see how the characters develop.

B00006BTCA|5.0|this is a great uptempo album. By uptempo, I mean driving with a solid beat. It helps, perhaps, in order to appreciate this album, to have a bit of an eighties sensibility as it seems to reference this era's music to extent. I am not going to shout \\"Joy Division\\" like the rest though. I really find this music to be a classic example of absorbing and moving on when it comes to these 80's references. If you listen to this next to any of the bands to which the sound has been credited by others, you'll find that it is not really anywhere near the same. It much more of an evolutionary leap and it sounds great. <br /> <br />I keep listening to this album (I can't help it). Solid all the way through. Seriously. I am actually a Zappa fan, but have a lingering love for The Smiths, Stone Roses, and I gotta say this kind of music comes off to me as very well composed. <br /> <br />I likey.
B0000AI45P|5.0|This album Still amazes any music fan after all these years. \\"Friction\\" \\"venus\\" and the Incredible title tracks are all desperate and beautiful at once. A masterpiece.

B000003JA9|5.0|Up until \\"Aqualung\\", Jethro Tull was known for their eclectic music that went from English-folk to blues and jazz-flavored rock. While some of that music occasionally bordered on harder rock, typically Jethro Tull's music was relatively light and mellow. \\"Aqualung\\" pushed Jethro Tull into hard rock in 1971.<br /><br />The album opens with the title track. The opening guitar riffs are immediately recognizable to anyone familiar with classic rock. As the song progresses, Ian Anderson uses reverberation on his vocals. The combination of guitars and drums with Ian's vocals placed this song solidly into some of the hardest rock being created at the time. The lyrics are about an old, homeless man with lecherous thoughts. The lyrics are very descriptive and poetic, intelligently written and executed. While the topic could have delved into a moral tale, the lyrics are descriptive rather than lamenting or accusatory or a social policy.<br /><br />\\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" follows, a story about a lady of the night (or day, apparently). As in \\"Aqualung\\", to which this song refers, the guitar riffs drive to a rock beat, along with Ian Anderson's enthusiastic vocals. Again, the lyrics are descriptive rather than judgmental. In an era when many songs exhorted compassion and care, these lyrics observed and described.<br /><br />After the first two harder sounding songs comes \\"Cheap Day Return\\", a return to the acoustic English folk sound typical of Tull's earlier albums. This short song is almost an interlude between the previous song and \\"Mother Goose\\". \\"Mother Goose\\" is surrealistic and poetic, mixing references to fictional characters and plays on names. The song is largely acoustic and heavily folk influenced, Ian's flute lending a medieval sound to the music. At one point the vocals also harmonize in a folk-like fashion. Near the end of the song an electric guitar provides occasional accompaniment to provide a slightly harder edge to this folk-sounding piece.<br /><br />Continuing the mellower music is \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\", with strings and acoustic instruments. The music is folk; the lyrics are mellow and an enjoyment of life. Before we think the album is going to stay in the folk vein for the rest of the album, \\"Up to Me\\" returns to the guitar-laden music of the opening songs. The guitar riffs are recognizable as being from the late 60s/early 70s, but the Ian Anderson lyrics continue to be obscure and poetic.<br /><br />The next five songs together make up \\"My God\\", a concept within itself that questions religion and the hypocrisy of people that style themselves believers in God. Included are questions regarding buying salvation and the role of religion in war and life, and whether people in the church are as pure and holy as religion would have you believe. Given current events, these lyrics are as relevant today as they were in 1971.<br /><br />\\"My God\\" begins with guitar riffs that may remind you of Black Sabbath. The song is complex, however, and later the vocals are chants that may be intended to invoke an image of monastic chants to the listener. While the lyrics of \\"Aqualung\\" were observatory and descriptive, these lyrics are accusatory, demanding to know why religion isn't living up to its own ideals. The remaining songs, \\"Hymn 43\\", \\"Slipstream\\", \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and \\"Wind-Up\\", all have a common theme based on religion, questioning the role and morality of organized religion.<br /><br />A word of caution.  There are several versions of this album available.  All but this version have bonus tracks.  Similarly, the cost of these various versions varies.  The bonus tracks may be found elsewhere, and their principal value is adding more bulk to the original vinyl album, which was a bit more than 43 minutes long.  Be sure you see which version suits your needs the best before buying.<br /><br />This album has two faces, \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"My God\\". \\"Aqualung\\" is relatively objective observation. \\"My God\\" questions religion. Much of the musicis rock, often with a harder edge. The lyrics are inspired, occasionally obscure, often poetic, and always intelligently done. If there was a category in rock called intellectual rock, this album would be in it. While this album is unlikely to appeal to many mainstream rock fans, the music and lyrics at the time were avant-garde, keeping in the tradition of Jethro Tull, and thus having substantial progressive rock elements. A must have for fans of cutting edge classic rock music.ch of the music is rock, often with a harder edge. The lyrics are inspired, occasionally obscure, often poetic, and always intelligently done.

B0007RT9LM|1.0|Hoping this \\"unrated\\" version will show something the original version didn't?   <br /> <br />Don't get your hopes up. <br /> <br />As with a host of other recent \\"unrated\\" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a \\"harder\\" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA. <br /> <br />Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of \\"Coyote Ugly\\" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|What you have here are good looking people we care nothing about. Preachy, wannabe chic, just plain crap.<br /><br />It's not the actors' fault or the director. The story is meaningless. Okay, I laughed through the whole miserable film, but was that the intent?<br /><br />Cheating has consequences. I get it. Actions have consequences. Deep, huh?<br /><br />From the reader to the green-light guy . . . are they zombies? What were they thinking? Or smoking??? It reminds me of Tim Robbins' character in The Player who gave the go to an inane movie about the DA who falls for the lady on death row.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Saw is one of the worst psychological thriller/horror film I have seen since Kiss the Girls.  It is pseudo-Harrision, tedious, and the writers obviously did not dwell in the research department for long while writing the script.  The plot is outlandish, unbelievable, and ultimately retarded.  Not only would a person not go to the great lengths and means to achieve his ends depicted in the film, but a person could not plausibly do any of the exaggerated actions depicted in the film.  I have heard many people say that this is the most disturbing film they have seen in a long time, and I can agree with that so long as they are disturbed by the fact that this film was actually made.  In a nutshell, Saw was a complete and utter waste of time.

0783225725|2.0|I'd read for years about how good this western is, but still put off seeing it.  I'm glad I did though.  I've seen it twice in the last 3 years, and it just gets duller and dumber.  The supernatural angle?  Painting the town red?   Shades of Sergio Leone?  None of this impressed me.  Don't get me wrong, I love Clint.  But, certain movies of his are just plain overrated.  'Unforgiven' is the same way.  I agree with the reviewer who said to stick with the spaghetti westerns.  They're much more entertaining and original, not to mention deserving of their reputation(s).
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is refreshing. Why? Because it doesn't sound like anything else out there. Mariah Carey albums always have a distinct vibe and flavor to them. It's just nice to hear exceptional voice on a CD again. Now I know what I've really been missing. If you're a fan of Mariah or a possible new one, I wouldn't hesitate to get this CD. It will be worth it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|There are no other words to describe Mariah's comeback other than...WOW!!! She sounds fantastic. This is definitely the best album released in 2005 thus far. Miss Carey deserves several Grammy noms for this. It's her best album yet. Highlights include: We Belong Together, Mine Again, Stay the Night, I wish You Knew, One and Only, Joy Ride, and Fly Like a Bird. I wouldn't hesitate to get this album.
0345457684|2.0|As another reviewer said, this author is no Gibson (or Heinlein). The graphic sex was over-the-top, but bearable. The violence and torture were unnecessary and distracted the reader from what is a clearly interesting and unique central idea for a sci-fi book. But what the heck is an Envoy? A soldier, a criminal, a freebooter? It's never explained clearly in the first third of the book (as much as I read before being too disgusted with the violence to continue). If you want great SF, read Neuromancer.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Before the album was completed, she died of a drug overdose in 1970 when she was twenty seven. This was her First Number One album. \\"Get it while you can\\" is a Beautifull song. Recomended.
6304698798|5.0|This is the only western that I can watch over and over and over and over...  Clint should have left westerns behind after this one, because he never even got close again-EVER.  He is not now, nor ever was, the caliber of director that Leone was-Clint's forte is screen presence/on screen style.  His best movies (as an actor) were those that had someone else direct, and challenged him to dig for something more or at least do something different.  This is one of those movies.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|Late one night, Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a United Nations translator, returns to her booth high above the floor of the General Assembly, to retrieve a bag she left behind. She overhears two men talking about an assassination plot involving the genocidal dictatorial leader of Mobatu, a small African country. The next day, she learns that this same leader is coming to the UN to address the General Assembly on Friday. She reports what she heard and Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) are the Secret Service agents assigned to the case. At first, Silvia assumes that she is going to be protected; she thinks that the men having the conversation may have seen her. But Keller soon explains that it is the Secret Service's job to protect the foreign dignitary in question. Not her.<br /><br />So begins \\"The Interpreter\\", the new film from Sydney Pollack. Pollack is the director behind such films as \\"Out Of Africa\\", \\"Three Days of The Condor\\" and \\"The Firm\\". It is one of his better films, but still lacks a few elements to help it join \\"Condor\\" in the top tier of great movie thrillers.<br /><br />Actually, the film begins in Mobatu. It is almost eerie how closely this scene resembles some of the recent headlines out of Iraq. This memorable prologue helps to quickly and efficiently establish the people and place the remainder of the film is about.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are both great. Kidman plays Broome, a woman who grew up in the small country of Mobatu and then lived in a number of European countries, making her a perfect candidate for a UN interpreter. At one point, Keller says `she is the UN' referring to her training and upbringing. Throughout the story, Kidman walks a fine line, balancing opposing parts of her character, which is quickly called into question. Keller has trouble believing that she overheard two people, late at night, talking into a microphone, on the floor of the General Assembly, in a language that only Silvia and a handful of others understand, talking about the assassination. As he digs further into her background and motivations, Kidman walks a fine line between victim and instigator, diplomat and revolutionary, helpless and in charge. These shades of her character are revealed gradually, as her back-story unfolds, lending a subtlety to the performance. Also, the film occasionally backtracks, as Keller's investigation proceeds, and Broome's character changes even further. The character and the performance are equally complex, adding great depth to the story.<br /><br />Penn plays Keller, a by-the-book agent for the Secret Service who has just returned from leave. He is experiencing some troubles in his life and his boss (Sydney Pollack, in a cameo) isn't sure he is ready to return to work. Preferring to stay busy, he wants to be out of his apartment as much as possible, going so far as to sleep on the couch of his office. The interesting thing about this character is that Keller is experiencing the same sort of feelings Broome has experienced many times in her life. In one of their conversations, she reveals how the people of Mobatu deal with similar problems and this seems to give Keller a degree of comfort.<br /><br />Thankfully, the filmmakers shied away from making these two characters lovers. Keller does bond with her, but he simply wants to protect her and figure this whole puzzle out. Naturally, Broome is drawn to Keller, but only because he is her protector. It is a relationship of convenience and provides some interesting conversations.<br /><br />Catherine Keener's Dot Woods is a memorable sidekick. Keller's partner, she is the equivalent of the comic relief character that all agents of the FBI, DEA, Police department, etc. have in films. But Keener's character is more intelligent, her remarks are more deeply observed and she doesn't live to provide comic relief. Woods is the longtime partner of Keller, it almost seems as though they can read each other's thoughts, and she knows a lot about him and his problems. This knowledge is what leads to her `witty remarks' and they also help us to learn more about each character.<br /><br />All of Sydney Pollack's films are created with the highest quality craftsmanship.

0790729644|2.0|It's good to know that I'm not alone when I say this was slow, boring, and forgettable.  There isn't anything here that hasn't been done before, and better-particularly by Clint himself.  Over time, I think more people will see this as a lifetime achievement 'thing' for Clint and less as any great cinematic triumph, which it's not.  Stick with 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'.  Violent (don't forget Dirty Harry) movies are why Clint even exists in the public's mind.  For him to use more violence to preach about violence is too little, too late-and hypocritical too.
B00024BHTC|2.0|I should first establish myself as a great fan of Nightwish; I found their first three albums moving, melodic and artistic. Tuomas is truly a poet, Tarja, an angel with voice to match; Emppu, Sami and Jukka created a fascinating blend of sound meeting opera and classical as I'd never quite heard before. And now, all I hear is rehashed, synthesized crap. It seems that Nightwish has certainly kept up with the times--in falling into the mainstream mangling of sound in order to enthrall a childish audience that gleans nothing from their more mature pieces. I am fond of a few songs on this album, but I can honestly say that not a single one can compare with Angels Fall First or Oceanborn, the former being perhaps their finest release to date. You can't kill a classic. I know that the band experienced a great deal of change before collaborating on Once, but I never expected that it would yield results as catastrophic as this. Tarja is now enjoying great success in her musical career, I know the others are working are multiple projects themselves--and if this is the quality of production Nightwish intends to make tradition of, then I think the band is finished, and better that it is, because this simply is not music with the symphonic beauty and integrity preserved in their previous works. Oh, and, what the hell happened to the flute? I miss Esa Letinen :( <br /> <br />If you are a Nightwish die-hard, and if you can truly communicate with their previous releases (with the exception of Century Child, which I found absolutely atrocious) as such music was intended to speak to the listener, I would not suggest disappointing yourself by buying this album. Then again, while it falls agonizingly short of the mark Nightwish had consistently set for itself prior to the release of Century Child, curiosity just might compel you to purchase it. I have to admit that I listen to the album from time to time--but I tend to skip between two tracks alone, which are not by any means soul-shaking; just a bit catchy, and lacking the grating sound so many of the songs on this album tend to have.  <br /> <br />Meh. All bands experience a kind of evolution, oftentimes for the worse. Consider Metallica, gone terribly awry, and unable to compete with its better days. Well. Go buy Angels Fall First or something.  <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|While reading an interview with Quentin Tarantino <br />online this weekend, I was intrigued when he said to a <br />magazine editor that the best film of 2004 (in his <br />opinion) was \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  Couple that with <br />the fact that my mom was born in London and I was <br />raised with a wry (or is that \\"rye\\") sense of humor to <br />the tune of Benny Hill and Monty Python.  I sojourned <br />over to Blockbuster to find SOTD and rushed home to place it im DVD player.  I just finished watching it.  <br /> <br />FIVE!!!  This spoof on zombie flicks (\\"Dawn of the <br />Dead\\" in particular), is a side-splitter.  And only <br />Tarantino could appreciate it as much as I.  It is a <br />tongue-in-cheek (maybe tongue-in-ear) look at horrific <br />Zombie flicks.  I've never laughed more during a <br />horror romp than this...maybe equal to the \\"Scary <br />Movie\\" Tri-quil\\" but with much more pizzazz and <br />intellect (that's the way the British do it...blimey). <br />  <br /> <br />The premise is superb.  It's the story of an appliance <br />store manager (a loser in the making), who lives with <br />a loser roommate, and is in the midst of losing his <br />girlfriend, his mother, stepdad...and a grip on life.  <br />A total LOSER!  But when the zombies arrive, the <br />mundane world of losers no longer holds water.  It's <br />every loser for him(her)self.  Hilarious!   <br /> <br />SOTD is popcorn munching fun!...with an awesome <br />soundtrack!  Yep!  It's a 5!  Buy it!

B0002IU988|5.0|I am enjoying this CD so much! My brother was listening to it in the kitchen a week ago, and I said \\"WHO is that you are listening to?\\" He said \\"Alter Bridge. The new Creed.\\" He loaned me the CD and I've been listening to it constantly. I'm not going to say Alter Bridge is better than Creed, because everyone has a different style. But I think they made a amazing debut album and lived up to their reputation. Hey, don't you think it's hard to come out of the shadow of a former band? And their former band has a HUGE shadow! The balance between vocals and guitar is tricky but I think they pulled it off. Both are good. My favorite songs are \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"In Loving Memory\\"... I would definitely recommend this album. Alter Bridge had a lot to live up to, and they did.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is a five star metal album (I say that because it was an album when I got it back in '86).  It amazes me more each time I pull it out.  If all of the songs sound the same to you, listen to it more.  They are definitely not all the same.  If you are offended by the lyrics, what are you listening to slayer for in the first place?  Besides, just because they sing about the Nazi \\"angel of death\\" does not necessarily mean that they are promoting what he did;  they're telling a (short) story and what better music to set it to?  It's great art!  Brutal, dark art, but if you really love intense metal, you will love this album.  If you love St. Anger, don't defile this album/CD by purchasing it, and don't bring down the rating with a worthless, nadless review.  The fact that this CD has so many shocked/confused reviews is testament to how widespread and influential it has been.

B00009ATIX|3.0|... then again, maybe not.<br /><br />This is the story of a space station where the crew has cut off communications with earth. A security force is sent to investigate but disappears - unfortunately we never find out where they disappeared to or even if they came to harm.  George Cloony plays Chris Kelvin, a civilian psychologist on earth. He is approached and asked to go to the space station to investigate what is happening with the crew and, since one of the crew members is a close friend of his, they think he may be able to assist the crew from a psychological standpoint and save the mission. Okay, so you can see we're already on pretty shaky ground here. Civilian with no training and trips to outer space don't mix well.<br /><br />Anyway, When he arrives on the ship there are just two crew members left. His friend has already committed suicide by the time he gets there and there is no mention of anyone else or anything else regarding what may have happened to other people. Anyway, the two remaining crew members don't appear in the movie much after the initial opening. The remainder of the movie is focused on his relationship with his dead wife who mysteriously appears on the ship in his locked room. That's just the opening, and it doesn't get much better.<br /><br />There are lots of scenes where they just stare at each other without speaking. Everything is dark - you feel like saying \\"why doesn't anyone turn on the lights!\\"  You wonder if anything is ever going to happen. It was one of the quietest, darkest movies I've ever watched - highly reminiscent of 2001 Space Odyssey. Some people may like this movie, but I'm willing to bet a higher percentage will be on the fence like I am, or just plain dislike it.

B000001EL7|5.0|To the KISS purist, \\"Love Gun\\" is the band's final studio album. Of course the band would go on to release over a dozen additional albums, but this was the last album in which all four members of the original lineup participated in all the songs. Although drummer Peter Criss is credited as playing on \\"Dynasty\\" (1979) and \\"Unmasked,\\" (1980) shadow drummer Anton Fig actually played on those two albums (except for Criss's \\"Dirty Living\\" from \\"Dynasty.\\")<br /><br />This is also the last KISS album in which the band stuck to its roots and made a no-holds-bar rock album (until 1982's Creatures of the Night). After \\"Love Gun\\" the band would venture out into disco-pop, with the excellent \\"Dynasty\\" and the mediocre \\"Unmasked.\\"<br /><br />To put it simply, \\"Love Gun\\" was both the pinnacle and the end of KISS's great 70s legacy. But what a way to go. From start to finish, \\"Love Gun\\" is one of KISS's best collections of songs.<br /><br />Stanley's go for the jugular, fast-and-heavy \\"I Stole Your Love\\" gets the album off to a great start. Simmons' \\"Christen Sixteen\\" is probably the best song he ever wrote, and is one of the best KISS songs ever recorded. Ace Frehley's solo in it is absolutely killer (it was actually written by Eddie Van Halen, and Frehley went over it, note-for-note). Simmons' \\"Got Love For Sale\\" is a good, mid-paced rocker and keeps up the momentum. Frehley's classic \\"Shock Me,\\" is one of the spaceman's best songs. \\"Stanley's \\"Tomorrow and Tonight\\" is an excellent, fast-paced rocker, and the backup singers are a nice touch. Stanley's \\"Love Gun,\\" is one of the best songs that KISS has ever recorded. The pounding drums, the killer solo, the infectious sing-along-chorus make it a classic. The momentum keeps on going with Criss's rocking \\"Hooligan.\\" Simmons branches out a little bit with \\"Almost Human,\\" which reminds me a little of Van Halen's \\"Atomic Punk.\\" Simmons' \\"Plaster Coaster\\" is a good rocker and a good way to wind-down the album, without loosing any steam. The closing \\"Then She Kissed Me,\\" is an updated version of the 60s classic, done in the style of KISS. This is an excellent cover version and a good way to close out the album.<br /><br />\\"Love Gun\\" is a great album, from start-to-finish.

B0000VAFO0|1.0|Obviously modern day vampires have lost the art of conversation. Paint on a malevolent scowl, grunt a few choice phrases and maintain only 2 different facial expressions and you're a vampire! <br /> <br />I remember the old style vampire movies where they were the most charming of creatures, relying on smooth talking to lure the pretty damsels into their bedrooms for some quick neck nibbling action.   <br /> <br />Now they own guns, are appallingly inept shots at target and apparently their images now reflect on mirrors and cctv monitors. <br /> <br />Werewolves walk on walls too apparently! <br /> <br />If only we could take the collective wooden performances, mould them into a stake and drive it through the heart of this garbage. <br /> <br />The vampires in this movie don't suck - they blow!

B00000J7SS|5.0|This is not my favorite Miles album.  I really don't even like it all that much, save a track or two.  I personally prefer early Miles over jazz/rock-fusion Miles, but I give Bitches Brew 5 stars because this is one important jazz album.  It doesn't matter whether Davis was the first to try to marry jazz and rock, what matters is that he was the most influential and classic jazz artist to try to do it--therefore calling the world's attention to it.  Even if you don't buy it, every jazz head needs to hear this once and compare it to Miles' earlier works of art and the music that has come after it.

B00005JNQ8|2.0|THE INTERPRETER was well-acted and pretty to look at, but the story was incomprehensible and vague. I'm still not entirely sure what the heck happened, to be honest. Sean Penn's character is given a ridiculous backstory. The centerpiece bus scene took about 5 minutes too many to set up. And the ending was a dud.<br /><br />My friend Black and I tried our best to discuss it last night, but there wasn't much to discuss.<br /><br />\\"Could you figure out what was going on?\\" Black asked me. \\"I got lost in it really early, and I still don't know what happened.\\"<br /><br />Though I'm not exactly sure happened in the film, with its one to five assassination plots explained away while the pacing seemed so slow, I am sure it was not as well-done as it could've been. The movie needed more time inside the UN, a more coherent plot and a lot more Catherine Keener.
0385474547|4.0|Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is about a man that stuggles between being a family man, a farmer, and the atributes his father left behind.  His struggles in life lead him to a devistating conclusion.  The genre of this book is postcolonial critique, which basically means this book is a tragedy.  It seems to me that Achebe wrote this novel for audiences between middle school ages to people that are mature of older ages.  This book was written in past tense.  The time was set in the 1890's.  The setting was in the lower Nigerian Villages. <br />The major conflict of this novel is the conflict between the traditional society of Umuofia and the new customs brought by the new white government.  Okonkwo also struggles to be as different from his father as possile.  He feels that his father was a weak human being.  He is afraid of his son following in his fathers foot steps.   <br />The rising action was Okonkwo's murder.  The falling action was when the villagers allow the white government's people to escape also when Okonkwo realizes the weaknesses of the tribe he has tried to establish. <br />This book could very well become a classic.  It strives upon the earlier traditions and the new customs of the white government.  I think this book is very good!  It teaches readers of all ages a lot about the struggles of new beginnings.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always been a Green Day fan. From Dookie on I loved everything they did. They were the pioneers of the current punk rock kick and really at the forefront for a long time. Then something went awry and they started to fade into oblivion. All of a sudden, American Idiot came along. Let me say that this is one of the best ALBUMS, from start to finish, I've heard in a VERY long time. As a matter of fact I would peg it as THE best rock album to be released in years. Many of the reviews here have broken down the album song by song and graded them individually. And I can firmly say that you just can't do that with this album, and THATS what makes it spectacular! Although each song can stand strongly on its own, as a whole its an unstoppable force. From the moment you meet Saint Jimmy in Jesus Of Suburbia to when you bid him adu in Homecoming your taken on a tale of depression, anger, revolution, and even love with ole' Whatsername. With all the highs and lows this album offers and the journey you take throughout the course of the CD, not to mention the absolute GENIOUS behiend JOS and Homecoming, this is one album you can't afford to miss.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|This film is not so much a documentary, but an exploration in the creative process that made J M  Barrie Write PETER PAN. <br />As such, it looks at visions that creep into the viewpoint of the main character. The Commentary illustrates just how much of the fictional story interplays with the factual story of the life of the real J M Barrie. <br />From Start to Finish the film works as an enjoyable masterpiece. You will never know what parts are FX and what parts are not FX  unless you see the \\"Creating Neverland\\"  bonus feature. In this area, the care and the love for this story is evident in the way the actors, actresses, and producers  approach the film. It is still bizarre as how the deleted scenes  were expunged since the scenes were just great. <br />Radha Mitchell plays the ice Queen a little too well, and seems to me to be type-cast with her quality persona. <br /> <br />After seeing the film, you will totally enjoy the out-takes, or what some call the Blooper reel. <br /> <br />From start to finish, this film as an amazing product. And the extras are perfectly done. <br /> <br />ENJOY.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|some friends recommended this to me, decribing it's numerous spinal tap pleasures, art auction outrages, and whining millionaire melodramas.  it delivered all these and more in spades.  this film is a very well made odyssey that made me laugh my ass off at these guys, at their use of rediculous psycho-speak and their clueless self-absorbtion...but, unlike my girlfriend who was quite over them by the end of the movie, i found myself quite liking them.  this movie does something i've never seen before, which is showing rock stars unafraid of revealing themselves variously as middle-aged farts, shrewd buisness minded people calculating every gesture, emotional children, and bored and/or uninspired musicians.  none are flattering things.  but they get props for putting this out.  what seems like a very dull premise to those who are not voyeuristic or easily seduced by jerry springer-like exploits, turns actually into something of a warm portrait.  check out james hetfeild at his 6-year old daughter's ballerina class for simutaneous warm-fuzzies/ironic debacle.  them sitting around \\"opening\\" up their feelings with phil, the \\"band therapist\\", is certainly a less appealing image of a rock star to show the masses than the reclusive/abusive stereotype. <br /> <br />i should say that i once had an ear for their music in the 80s when i was a skateboarding punk rock teen, and i lost any taste for their overproduced slowed down ballad rock as they and i got older.  that said, i got much pleasure out of this, so i don't think anyone need be a fan to watch this movie.   <br /> <br />additionally the scenes with lars' father are strange and fantastic.  and the topper being the scenes with dave mustaine of megadeth.  jeezus key-riest!  what a goof-ball!  it really is a must see. <br /> <br />o, i forgot, the outtakes with ja rule and other hip hoppers in the studio is also a must see. <br /> <br />four stars for sure!! <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is perhaps the best album I have ever heard. All you trash talkers can trash talk all you want, but you will still not find a finer example of originality and prowess in writing songs anywhere in rock, modern or past. I've listened to this CD many times end to end, and to get the real feel of it, you have to do that. I guess ill jump on the bandwagon and review each song. <br /> <br />American Idiot- 3/5. Its alright. I like the idea-- yes, george bush is a redneck, yes he is stupid, and yes, we deserve a better president. was vastly overplayed, now i just skip it.  <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia- 5/5. This is probably my favorite all-time song after an Interpol song. All five parts are spectacular, but there really isnt anything to compete with this song's meaning, beautiful melody, or ridiculously well-done weaving of a story into a wonderful song. Particularly dearly beloved-- wonderful section. <br /> <br />Holiday- 4/5. Great song, particularly the line 'there's a flag wrapped around a score of men.' Great line. I don't like hearing it on the radio, mixed in with crap like rap and want to be rock like simple plan, but not much you can do about the top 40 charts.  <br /> <br />Boulevard- 3/5. I liked this song. I really, truly did. Until the radio got hands on it. Jesus, can they kill a song. Seriously, they freakin massacred it.  <br /> <br />Are we the Waiting- 4/5. Touching song. A bit slow, a bit boring, but nothing better to listen to late at night staring at the celing wishing you could get the hell out of wherever you are. <br /> <br />St. Jimmy- 4/5. Classic Green Day, gotta love the pace of this thing, nothing better to exercise to, just makes you want to run and run and run. 5/5 except for the end.  <br /> <br />Give me Novacaine- 5/5. I love it. Great song, kinda peaceful, but when the guitar kicks in in the chorus, you know its a great song. Great story too- key component to this album. I love it.  <br /> <br />She's a Rebel- 4.5/5 . 'And she'sholding on my heart like a hand grenade.' Gotta love it. What an awesome song-- great guitar-- great lyrics-- great tune. Love song like none other. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl- 4/5. Cool song, except for the beginning. I love the chorus. Its great. beginning gets 2/5, chorus gets 6/5. Averages to 4. Just another great part of the St. Jimmy story from a different point of view.  <br /> <br />Letterbomb- 5/5. Great, great song. Perhaps the most underground song on the album, freakin amazing song. Great lyrics, great tune, just great. In my music playing application, i have this song on repeat: played 283 times.  <br /> <br />Wake me up when September Ends- 4/5. Good song, kind of peaceful, listen to this on long car rides staring out the window out to a rainy countryside. I dont know why, but this song reaches in and grabs your heart. A side of green day we've never seen before.  <br /> <br />Homecoming- 5/5. Another great song. FIrst sequence is incredible, i love it. Great message, but poor St. Jimmy is dead :-( . However, really an incredible song, amost as good as JOS but not quite. <br /> <br />Whatsername-5/5. Just a great song. Nice at the beginning, nice melody, incredible lyrics, and when the guitar kicks in, its all there is to the world. <br /> <br />All in all, this is probably the best album I've ever bought. It''s a pity it didnt stay underground more but not much you can do about that. Great album, great message, and most of all, great music.

B000002U82|5.0|Whatever you can say about this album, it struck a chord with many people. Few albums can chart for over 700 weeks, and not have an effect on a generation. <br />I remember getting the vinyl of this in the 70's, and it was an amazing work. Some stoners did tell me that they listened to the album and it sounded like it lasted two hours or so, but an album is not going to sell on this sort of level by hitting solely the hippie  market. <br />Alan Parsons was the engineer on this project, and he thought so little of it, that he worked for scale. If he had the foresight ( and who the hell does have the kind of foresight that will reveal what is going to sell like hot cakes) he would have raked the money in over the years. However, Parsons can be credited with many aspects of the sound of this album, including the  cyclical beat of the cash register in money. And who-ever thought to flow the album together had a concept of genius... and I think this was either followed by many bands ( including YES in \\"TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC  OCEANS\\", or DARK SIDE was one of many albums in this class that had the album flow through for each side. <br />The longevity of this album is one testament to the success of this album, and in many respects it separates a generation; the kind of music  that is popular now is far removed from the music that seems to be liked  by the \\"younger generation\\" .... however, they do seem to sample the music from the 70's very freely. <br />DARK SIDE is an experience. DARK SIDE is elemental ... most importantly, DARK SIDE is essential for those wanting an education in the 70s evolution of music, and the music of the timeless style. <br /> <br />ENJOY

0375507256|2.0|Is it too much to ask of a writer of genre-busting new fiction to have at least mastered the cliches that he wrangles into something if not ground-breaking, at least award-winning? I could imagine a novel in segments that used the same kind of overlapping plot structure to infuse traditional genre fiction with new vim and energy. That novel is not, however, Cloud Atlas.  <br /> <br />Cloud Atlas's strengths are the same strengths that ordinary well-written fiction has: the characters catch our attention and do interesting things. I liked the second and fourth parts, set in 1930s Belgium and present-day Britain, respectively, and would enjoy reading them on their own. <br /> <br />Here's what I don't like: the contrived structure (e.g., the heroine of the fifth part watches a movie based on the fourth part; she could have been watching \\"Miss Congeniality 2\\" for all the difference it makes in the plot) does not make a set of so-so genre stories suddenly greater than the sum of their parts.  <br /> <br />The \\"thriller\\" section's villains are as two-dimensional as Encyclopedia Brown's antagonists. The science-fiction segment posits a totalitarian state that controls every facet of its citizens' lives, yet fritters away precious resources on maintaining a clone population of dumbed-down menial workers (contrast with Brave New World). The post-apocalyptic chapter's characters are harassed at critical times by evil warrior raiders on horseback, who apparently don't realize they are far more powerful than any other society on the small island they inhabit, because they only appear twice in the entire chapter. <br /> <br />And all these resonances and mysterious connections? Yes, maybe we are all characters in someone else's story. So what? According to Mitchell, evil, unscrupulous people have had their way throughout history and things are unlikely to change in the future. I finished the book saying \\"ho-hum,\\" not \\"Wow!\\"

1400079179|4.0|While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci--clues visible for all to see, yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.<br /><br />Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion--an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others.<br /><br />In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's ancient secret--and an explosive historical truth--will be lost forever.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightning-paced, intelligent thriller... utterly unpredictable right up to its stunning conclusion.

B00005Y46O|4.0|First released in 1971 as this was Free's fifth actual lp. This import reissue features the eight cuts that were pressed onto the original album, plus seven (7) bone-headed (er, I mean bonus cuts) tagged on for your listening pleasure. A few of the bonus tracks are of a SAME tune that was on the original lp, but a live take from another gig on the same tour. So, in a sense, 'Live' is somewhat like an audio scrap book for Free's late '71 UK tour. Tunes I thought were great to hear were their only hit \\"All Right Now\\", \\"Be A Friend\\", \\"Fire And Water\\", the touching \\"Ride On A Pony\\" and \\"Mr.Big\\". Line-up: Paul Rodgers - vocals, Paul Kossoff (R.I.P.) - guitar, Andy Fraser - bass & keyboards and Simon Kirke - drums. Great sound quality. Enjoy, now.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|You know, when I saw the previews for this movie on MTV, I was the same as everyone else: WTF? <br />However, the more I watch it, and the more I pay attention to it, the more I learn about the artistic beauty of it.  <br />One reason many people down this flick is because they don't connect the scenes the way they connect themselves in the director's mind. One has to actually think, \\"Aha, so that happened because this happened,\\" and not worry so much as to why the scenes seem unrelated.  <br />Another reason this flick gets thumbs down. It's too close to something that could actually be real, that would actually happen. Napoleon and his family, although disfunctional, are really quite normal. Only some of their odd traits are exaggerated for humor, making them seem unreal at the same time.  <br />If you don't think your way through a movie, you'll never be able to understand it and appreciate it to its fullest capacity.
B00005JNVS|5.0|Stephen Chow's past films have been \\"good\\".  While they typically displayed some very enjoyable if goofy martial arts scenes, much of the humor was lost on Western audiences.  The movies probably played very well to the original Asian audiences. <br /> <br />Kung-Fu Hustle is a new beast.  The humor present here is partly Asian, but it plays much better to a wider audience and includes so many obscure references to American movies that only a true movie buff will catch them all.  Everybody I saw it with in the theater was laughing their heads off for a majority of the run time.  Suffice if to say, the comedy works with full force. <br /> <br />In addition, the martial arts scenes are fantastic.  As comical as the movie can be, some of the fight scenes were pure art (the one with the \\"instrument\\" struck me in particular).  The choreographer, Yuen Wo Ping, is the same guy who did the fight scenes for the Matrix movies. <br /> <br />Some people complain that the movie has no plot.  This is only true in the sense that before the final scene (if you don't look at your watch, which you won't) you won't know when the movie is going to end.  That is, the plot doesn't have a pace where you can see a very clear exposition, build-up, and ending.  I found this to be a strength rather than a weakness.  I was so wrapped up in enjoying every scene as it came; I didn't want it to end, and the fact that the plot didn't have a pace that revealed the end was near just allowed me to enjoy each scene more. <br /> <br />Stephen Chow has been funny in the past, but his work has reached a new level.  If you saw Shaolin Soccer, think of this as Shaolin Soccer times 10.  This is a movie that all audiences should enjoy.  I'm seriously chomping at the bit for a chance to go see it again.

B0000541AM|4.0|The first time I saw The Warriors was during my freshman year of college when I was in one of my friend's rooms down the hall and he was watching it as one of TNT's late night specials. I immediately fell in love with this movie! What a great gang flick that has withstood the test of time. <br /> <br />I won't ruin the plot in case you haven't seen The Warriors yet, because you deserve to experience the film without having the fun and suspense taken from you. The movie is loaded with plenty of gangs, cops, subway scenes, colorful characters, and (at least as far as I am concerned) the single-greatest, most action-packed fight scene in cinema history involving a bathroom and roller skates. <br /> <br />The film drips with late 70's style in hair, music, and overall look. The cinematography is outstanding, with excellent use of New York City subway locales. Lacking a big-name cast, the acting is not bad either. Released in 1979, The Warriors went on to become both notorious and legendary. At the time of its release, crime was at epidemic proportions in New York, and critiques blasted the film as a glorification of gang violence. Efforts to ban the film were unsuccessful, however. The film has since become a cult classic and ushered in an era of movies depicting street gangs and gang life. The west coast rap trio Trest Delinquentes used the image from The Warriors' theaterical poster as the inspiration for the cover of its debut album in 1996. <br /> <br />As for the actual DVD edition of The Warriors, well that's a little different story. The picture quality is rather good, but all that Paramount decided to include with regards to extras was the original trailer for the film. This is quite disappointing. They really need to re-release a Collector's Edition of The Warriors which includes production notes, cast and crew interviews, and commentary regarding the political controversies surrounding this film when it was released. <br /> <br />There is one more disappointment with the DVD release. Why did they choose the lame cover image for the DVD case? It sucks! They need to use the cover image from the movie's theatrical poster and its VHS box. That image is a classic! <br /> <br />Still, all in all, The Warriors is an absolute must-have for fans of the street gang movie genre.

B000022TSY|5.0|Easy Rider, the winner of the Cannes Film Festival (Best Film by a new Director) speaks volumes about the time in which it was made: the pinnacle of one of the most socially tumultuous periods in U.S. history.<br /><br /> Easy Rider falls roughly inside the lines of the master narrative of the western. The hero is an outlaw named Wyatt (Peter Fonda), his partner is Billy (The Kid, presumably, played by the film's director, Dennis Hopper). The sub-narrative is the road, and this time a couple of longhair hippies ride it on motorcycles.<br /><br /> Billy is a loner who can't wait to get out of almost every place that he and Wyatt visit. It's the sense of family, and community, that Billy doesn't feel comfortable with. He's his own man, or wants to be, and community is anathema to his character. Wyatt takes it in stride, and besides, he tells Billy, \\"We're eating their food.\\"<br /><br />The ACLU lawyer, George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) joins the pair and finds inspiration and new joy in life from the road experience. Wyatt and Billy are not just longhairs but, as George tells Billy, \\"No, what you represent to them (the hostile locals) is freedom.\\"<br /><br />American Individualism, in 1969, was a classic thread running throughout American history, as was communalism. What was spectacular not only about Easy Rider but the sixties overall was the sense of blending of these two major threads in American history. The tension between Billy the Kid and the Hippie commune can be viewed, among other things, as the cinematic representation of the struggle for true Individualism in the Anglo American psyche. There is no ready resolution to this dichotomous past.<br /><br /> What Easy Rider does is lay out the bare bones of a classic American dilemma and invite the viewer to piece them together. The film is European art-house style. This is no ordinary cowboy movie. Dennis Hopper's directing is not merely brilliant; innovative would be an understatement. Lazslo Kovakcs' cinematography is more than breathtaking; it's magical. A fine classic to own and watch through the years, to think about and enjoy.ical.

B0006IIPJ4|2.0|Just like another rewiewer wrote, this movie is a sad typical case of what could have been done. With this wonderful technologie, the brilliant ideas and all the means at disposal, 'Sky Captain' might easily be a masterpiece, intensely enjoyed in the years to come by every old style sci-fi fanatics, but the truth is that very early in the pictute one begins to see that behind all the gadgets and visual candy there's not a single spark of intelligence. Most of what i think was already written by the aforementioned rewiewer, so i won't repeat it. I'd just like to add that besides the brainless plot (i mean, who cares about a dead and non-existant villain?...), the characters are hollow and the supposedly funny James Bond-type jokes are simply annoying, totally devoid of elegance and subtlety.  <br />All in all, and despite this irritating flaws, it's fair to say that this movie is still terrific entertainment, and the warming nostalgic feeling that pervades it along with the stunning images and special effects kind of compensate for the rest. But i can't help a feeling of frustration thinking how wonderful it could have been, had the director the talent for the story that he demonstrates for the visuals. Anyway, i'm looking forward for his next project, 'Princess of Mars', because the storie is in the same vein, and maybe a better effort will be done concerning the plot and the characters. Further more, he already has a source of inspiration in the fantastic ilustrations of the great Frank Frazetta, beginning with the picture of the same name. Let's hope for the best.
B000002U82|5.0|It was 1973. Pink Floyd had been stars during the late sixties psychedelic era - notching several major hits in Britain. But the band's leader and prime songwriter, Syd Barrett, left after completing only one LP, leaving the band searching for a new sound. Subsequent releases often seemed unfocused, containing moments of brilliance but not remaining consistent. Until Meddle was released in 1971. It set the stage for one of the best-selling, most influential, and best albums of all time. Dark Side of the Moon stayed on the charts for well over a decade - when the band imploded after power struggles and petty fights between band members, it was still present.     Even today, the songs are amazing. The mellow, neo-psychedelic Speak to Me/Breathe leads off. One of my personal favorite Floyd songs. On the Run is my least favorite, but it's interesting. Time is another classic, with some of Roger Waters' greatest lyrics. The Great Gig in the Sky has some fantastic vocals, even if the singer isn't saying anything. Money is one of the greatest songs ever, being both innovative (using weird time signatures and great lyrics), but hit-worthy (reaching No. 13 on the charts, I believe). Us and Them is great, perhaps my favorite on the entire album. Any Colour You Like segues directly out of Us and Them, and it's a fantastic instrumental. Brain Damage is another neo-psychedelic song with lyrics that may (or may not) reference Syd Barrett's untimely demise. Eclipse is a great album closer, the repetition is amazing. Any rock fan should own this disc, its release was a watershed moment in music akin to that of Highway 61 Revisited and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.     On a side note, I think someone is being a little vengeful towards Pink Floyd. Come on. Honestly, is it worth it? Are you proud of yourself because you've dragged down the average rating of Dark Side, what, half a star? Are you sitting home, giggling at your own incendiary wit? No one here is impressed, my friend. You are the one who's sad - not the rest of us who want to share great music with other listeners.
B0000017CA|5.0|Edited on 3/20/14<br /><br />One of the most extreme and diverse metal releases to emerge in the 90's, Acid Bath's 1994 full length debut album \\"When the Kite String Pops\\" is an underground sludge/doom metal classic that just grabs your attention and blows your mind away with it's pure raw sludgy heaviness, and amazing diversity throughout. While I do enjoy listening to other bands such as Crowbar, Down, Eyehategod, Soilent Green, and among others that hail from the New Orleans sludge metal scene, but however it's Acid Bath to me that really stand out the most out of all these great bands mainly due to their amazing diversity in their music. This album blends the band's trademark sludge/doom and stoner metal sound along with elements of death, black, thrash/speed, as well as hardcore, grindcore, punk, groove, grunge, blues, and melodic/acoustic rock elements are thrown in the mix too. Words just cannot even describe how incredible this album is. It's just chock full of sick, torturous vocals and moody melodies, thick and heavy sludgy riffs, bludgeoning rhythms, and various tempo changes throughout. It is truly a one of a kind masterpiece and so well ahead of it's time as well. Specifically, this album itself musically is just absolutely heavy, melodic and dark in atmosphere, as well as lyrically twisted, disturbing and bizzare yet very poetic which indeed both go so well hand in hand, and not to mention just by looking at the album's front cover artwork featuring a painting of Pogo the Clown which was done by infamous serial killer J.W. Gacy will have you feel that you are in for one seriously amazing ride when you first crank this album with the volume all the way up.<br /><br />The musicianship on this album here is just incredibly tight, massive and flawless. Every instrument here is played with absolute flawlessness and perfection throughout. Dax Riggs is such an amazingly talented vocalist with an absolutely incredible vocal range here on this album that ranges from angry, tortured and frightening screams, growls, shrieks and shouts to dark and moody yet very strong and soothing melodic clean vocals. Backing up Dax are guitarists Sammy Duet and Mike Sanchez who both indeed prove to be a very talented and brilliant axe duo. Their riffs on here are just downright mean, thick, crushing and brutally heavy throughout this album, guaranteed to stay stuck in your head for days, and they also thrown in some very cool and unique sounding solos here as well, and not to mention the guitars on here also make liberate use of squeals, pick scrapings and feedbacks as well. Elsewhere, rounding off the band are both bassist Audie Pitre and drummer Jimmy Kyle who both combine make a very tight, deadly and bludgeoning rhythm section with Audie laying down thick, dirty and heavy bass lines and Jimmy doing an all around great job behind the drums as well. Unfortunately, in January 1997, Audie Pitre was killed along with this parents when they were hit head-on by a drunk driver on the Bourg-Larose Highway in Louisiana, and the group would disband later that year after Audie's death.<br /><br />The album's opening track \\"The Blue\\" begins with some opening feedback and then a thick, heavy bass riff comes in along with a heavy, droning and dirty Sabbath-esque riff before the song starts to grind away at a great mid-tempo pace. The song meanwhile features Riggs alternating between his angry growls and screams and moody clean vocals as well as it's share of tempo changes and cool whammy-bar solo is also thrown in for good measure. Next up, we have \\"Tranquilized\\" which is a fast and groovy 70's rock/metal influenced track that is highlighted by catchy clean vocals, groove driven guitars and pumping drums, as well as a slow crushing and sludgy Sabbath-esque middle section with another cool squealing solo thrown in, meanwhile track three \\"Cheap Vodka\\" is a short yet brutal hardcore/crust punk influenced number clocking in just a little over 2 minuteslong which boasts mostly psychotic screams and shouts, abrasively grinding riffs, and great up-tempo drumming. Another album highlight \\"Finger Paintings of the Insane\\" is a more slower sludge/doom number that brings the tempos down and is highlighted by heavy, monster crushing riffs along with fat, meaty bass lines, thunderous double bass drumming, plus more amazing vocal work and the song also ends with some wicked guitar feedback with a killer bass riff included as well. Track five \\"Jezebel\\" immediately begins with a full-on death metal/grindcore assault with a quick barrage of pummeling blast beats and ferocious death/thrash riffing galore and also features stomping double bass drums, plus more cold blooded screams, until the song does slow things down when it hits the chorus, before picking up again with some really heavily grinding chainsaw-like riffing near the end. Next up, we have track six and perhaps my favorite song on the whole album \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\" is a gorgeously awesome gothic style acoustic ballad that features beautifully executed acoustic guitar strumming as well as some nice acoustic solos, plus amazing clean vocal work from Riggs throughout as well as more dark and disturbing yet poetic lyrics as always. This song is also further highlighted by some killer yet steady double bass kicking combined with the acoustic guitars during near the end of the song. However, after the moody mellowness of \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\", track seven \\"Dr. Seuss is Dead\\" brings back the raw and sludgy heaviness with a huge bang. The song begins with some fade-in guitar feedback aided by some mean sounding bass, and the song then erupts with a crushingly explosive doom like riff. The song also later gains momentum and energy with some thrash metal like tempos which includes more faster, grinding buzzsaw riffing and some blistering double bass drumming only to slow things down again and then later regain faster energy yet again by the end of the song.<br /><br />Other highlights on here include track eight \\"Dope Fiend\\" (which begins with almost the same guitar feedback as the opening track \\"The Blue\\") is highlighted by more crunching, sludgy, teeth grinding riffs throughout including a cool grunge-like opening riff, meanwhile \\"Toubabo Koomi\\" is another fiery hardcore punk-infused mosher that even has it's share of slow, droning tempos as well. Elsewhere, \\"God Machine\\" is a brilliant death metal style song that is highlighted by some creepy spoken word parts in the beginning, along with super brutal and ear shredding guitar riffs, powerful double bass drumming, and awesome vocals and lyrics throughout, and the following tracks \\"The Mortician's Flame\\" and \\"What Color is Death\\" both keep the crushing heaviness going with the former track keeps a steady forward drum beat and features more strong crunching, churning riffage, plus some great bass work including a nice bass intro and the latter track is a brutal mosh pit worthy song that boasts more torturous vocals and pulverizing double bass lead riffing, plus a wicked solo is thrown in as well. Afterwards, we also have another brilliant and melodic acoustic track in \\"Bones of Baby Dolls\\" which sports one of the coolest acoustic solos that I've heard, and it also features more of Riggs' excellent melodic vocals as well, and of course the album's closing track \\"Cassie Eats Cockroaches\\" is such an amazing song that features a killer, brutal and mesmerizing groove induced riff, and then later kicks into a brutally menacing death metal vibe with more menacingly heavy riffs and tight double bass drumming, as well as more of Riggs' menacing vocals and sexually disturbing lyrics, and there's even some movie audio samples from \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" included as well.<br /><br />Now Acid Bath would go on to release a second album in 1996 entitled \\"Paegan Terrorism Tactics\\" and unfortunately it would also be the band's final studio album before splitting up in 1997 after Audie Pitre's death. After Acid Bath disbanded, vocalist Dax Riggs would go on to form Agents of Oblivion which also included guitar Mike Sanchez, and they would release their only self titled album in 2000. Then Riggs would go on to form an indie rock band called Deadboy and the Elephantmen, releasing two studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 2007, and then he would go solo afterwards and currently has two solo albums out now, and other guitarist Sammy Duet would go on to join fellow New Orleans sludge metallers Crowbar for three albums (\\"Odd Fellows Rest\\", \\"Equilibrium\\", and \\"Sonic Excess in it's Purest Form), and is currently shredding the axe with Goatwhore (another great band from New Orleans btw).<br /><br />All in all, Acid Bath's \\"When the Kite String Pops\\" is without a shadow of a doubt a true 90's sludge/doom/stoner metal classic, and remains a classic to this very day forward. From beginning to end, this album is just so easy and great to listen to with the volume turned all the way up. Each and every song on here definitely has it's very own identity, no questions asked. Trust me, this album is just absolutely flawless, you won't even regret buying it whatsoever. Highly recommended for fans of Black Sabbath, Pantera, Down, Crowbar, Soilent Green, Eyehategod, Goatwhore, etc...<br /><br />\m//>Other highlights on here include track eight \\"Dope Fiend\\" (which begins with almost the same guitar feedback as the opening track \\"The Blue\\") is highlighted by more crunching, sludgy, teeth grinding riffs throughout including a cool grunge-like opening riff, meanwhile \\"Toubabo Koomi\\" is another fiery hardcore punk-infused mosher that even has it's share of slow, droning tempos as well.

B00007LTIA|4.0|Upon its release, Tales from Topographic Oceans was called everything - the Yes boys heard it all. From momentous masterpiece to pretentious prattle, the response was mixed at best. And this album was never an easy one to like. Sure, Yes had tried long songs before - on Fragile there had been three eight-minute plus songs, and they had previously done an excellent side-long epic with Close to the Edge (not to mention two nine-minute plus songs on the other side), but Tales from Topographic Oceans was ten times more ambitious than that. A double album (on LP) consisting of only four songs, each taking up an entire side? Critics balked. The joke was all too easy - Yes had gone \\"over the edge\\" this time. Even keyboardist Rick Wakeman said it was overblown, leaving the band after this album's tour. And for years afterwards, Tales was victim to a tarnished reputation; an unfortunate result of its bulk and ambition.    But it never really deserved it.     Not that it's the best album Yes ever made - it's certainly not my favorite, and the long songs can sound very tedious upon first listen. It's definitely an acquired taste, at least for me. And for you listeners who have only heard 90125 and Big Generator, well, you'll probably cower at the majesty of real Yes. The Revealing Science of God and Ritual: Nous Sommes du Soleil are both classic Yes songs. The Remembering - High the Memory is, in my opinion, slightly overlong. At its best moments, though, it can give you chills. The Ancient is...weird, but Yes needed to begin expanding their vision. Actually, The Ancient points the way to the more intense moments on Relayer. The album's main problem is its flow. After finishing one twenty-minute suite, it's sometimes difficult to jump into another one. Pick up Fragile, Close to the Edge, and The Yes Album before plunging into Tales from Topographic Oceans. When you finally do listen, listen with both ears wide open. Believe me, you'll need to so that you can hear all the layers of this incredibly dense, somewhat flawed, but ultimately quite impressive rock symphony.
B000002HJR|5.0|Consisting members from Eyehategod, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, and of course the mighty Pantera, Down's 1995 debut NOLA is one of the best heavy metal albums ever made. On this album you have Phil Anselmo on vocals, Kirk Windstein and Pepper Keenan on guitars, Todd Strange on bass, and Jimmy Bower on drums. The opening song Temptation's Wings is one of the heaviest songs on here, and Phil really screams his head off on that one. The second track Lifer shows Phil's excellent singing abilities. Other great standouts include Swan Song, Stone The Crow, Rehab, Hail The Leaf, Eyes Of The South, and Underneath Everything. Overall this great album is an absolute must have for fans of Eyehategod, Corrosion Of Conformity, Crowbar, and of course Pantera. Buy this album now, ride \\"Temptation's Wings\\", and become a \\"Lifer\\". Peace Out!<br /><br />Now for the song ratings<br /><br />1. Temptation's Wings: 5/5 (Man I love that song)<br /><br />2.

1400032717|4.0|If you are looking for a book slightly off the beaten path, this was a fun little story with a quite interesting perspective. There really isn't much to the extremely simple plot, but what makes this a really fun read is the perspective. Although I am not autistic or don't know anyone who is, the book really seems to do a good job of putting you as the reader in the perspective of a child suffering from this condition. I really enjoyed the perspective of the main character that was both naive and revealing at the same time.
B0007GAERG|2.0|Poor Mariah, where has the talent gone? I had high hopes for this cd after the unfair treatment that was \\"glitter\\" and the mellow though consistent \\"charmbracelet\\". \\"mimi\\" is nothing more than a desperate attempt to relive the glory days of a once blossomed career. Why is every song ruined by guest rappers and hip hop? (to the floor,its like that).where is the vocals? where is the stand out uniqueness of earlier Mariah gems...\\"butterfly\\" \\"daydream\\" etc. Mariah's desperate attempt to have \\"street cred\\" (circles,stay the night)has over shadowed all of the songs on here. This is a horrid cd that is over produced (joyride)and way too calculated(mine again) Pity cause Mariah was once a real talent. May i suggest an accapella record next time...just \\"the voice\\" and instruments would be nice...leave the rappers at home! A shame! D-
B00005JNQ8|2.0|There's obviously a portion of the movie-going public that enjoys stressful  \\"thrillers\\".  And yes, they can be good movies if done properly.  There's a fine line between \\"thriller\\" and \\"horror\\"; Alfred Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" is a good example of a film that dances along that line.  Some movies go too far toward the horror side, and are failures.  Another way a thriller can be brought down is when in an attempt to be, y'know, thrilling, it's just hard to follow.  Sydney Pollack's \\"The Interpreter\\" winds up doing the latter. <br /> <br /> Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is a foreign language specialist at the United Nations who overhears a whispered plot to assassinate the corrupt leader of the small African nation where she used to live.  In typical government fashion, rather than believing her when she notifies the authorities, Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) instead \\"investigates\\" Silvia, which makes very little sense.  Why would someone connected with an assassination go to the authorities about it? <br /> <br /> At any rate, after a couple tense scenes where the Bad Guys try to silence Silvia, Agent Keller changes his mind and decides to protect her by doing really helpful things like watching her apartment from across the street. <br /> <br /> From the trailers, this movie looked like it had real promise, but it just never really worked.  If there is one thing that is to blame, it probably has to be poor editing.  It's not that the editing was sloppy (though I don't even want to talk about Nicole Kidman's magically switching hairstyles), but some techniques that were probably meant to be artistic or interesting were just plain confusing.  There would be two different scenes going on, and the picture apparently randomly cut between them, paying no heed to what the audio was doing.  We'd be looking at one person doing something, and hear the voice of someone who was in an entirely different place.  That's not artistic, it's just stupid. <br /> <br />Another editing-related problem was that the film was just plain-and-simple too long.  There were a couple scenes (including a very climactic, tense scene) that seemed too long.  Even that tense scene went on so long that I didn't care how it ended as long as it just ENDED. <br /> <br /> But the kiss of death for this movie, pushing it into two-star territory, was that it phoned ahead on a few things.  This is absolutely the worst possible thing you can do to a thriller.  The whole point is that the audience has no idea what's going to happen next, and if they've been tipped off, you've already lost it. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the saving grace of this film is Sean Penn.  The guy doesn't win an Academy Award for nothing, you know.  His character is definitely the most likable in the film, and he plays it brilliantly.  There's the right combination of toughness and sensitivity for him to be conceivable as a competent Secret Service agent and a caring person. <br />
0380788624|5.0|It took me many months to get through this book--I'd read it and leave it, read it and leave it.  So, I'd forget who was who, etc. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the virtuosity of the writer. I've read SNOWCRASH, years ago, and liked that as well. Couldn't finish DIAMOND AGE for some reason that escapes me. As usual, I had to have a dictionary nearby. That slowed me down as well.   <br /> <br />Anyway, as a woman, I found the witty parts terrific, and the herculian efforts of the characters to do their respective jobs quite amazing. I thought the ending didn't quite fit--I pictured the redheaded bad guy from The Incredibles in the role of Waterhouse's (if I have the protagonist geek's name correct)arch enemy.  <br /> <br />Mostly, I found Stephenson's mastery of the language and his  subject matter breathtaking.
B000002HH2|5.0|Post is far far better than her debut. On this album she likes to create darker more hectic soundscapes. She still retains a little bit of her \\"Debut\\" side  namely on tracks like -You've Been Flirting Again\\"- , \\"Cover Me\\" and \\"Headphones\\" other than that she has fully moved on.<br /><br />Post eclipses everything Debut did including chart success.<br /><br />\\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" became her first and so far only UK TOP 5 HIT.<br /><br />This album perfectly blends string groups and bursting programming into one innovative album. However this is not her best album, Medulla is. If anyone who wants to get into Bjork's music, they should listen to Post first instead of the average \\"Debut\\" or daringly beautiful \\"Medulla\\".
1400032717|4.0|I started listening to this book on audio and I really enjoyed the voice of the reader and how he portrayed the thoughts of the young boy in this story.  I was then unable to finish listening to the story and i bought the book.  Although there are pictures in the book that help you understand the main character's thoughts, such as maps and diagrams, I really missed hearing the voice of the reader from the audio-book.  It is a touching look into the mind of a child with Autism.
B0007GAERG|2.0|I am very disappointed in this album. As well as the last few albums. The last Mariah Carey album that I really enjoyed was \\"Butterfly.\\" There was really only one song on this album that I enjoyed. That is \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" However, I have always been a Mariah Carey fan and I will continue to support her music. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Rosey
006054094X|5.0|When I bought this book I did not expect such a discovery. I never liked history and it is not my strong field, but I am so surprised that there is not enough information about amazing Chinese expedition from 1421. I lived in Europe for a while and I am used to think that Portuguese and Spaniards are the \\"big ocean heroes\\". I read this book with extreme interest and too bad I have missed PBS program about it.  <br />The book is very well written for none marine, navigator or history specialist.  <br />I would recommend it to all people, to expend their horizons. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Wow, I had been waiting for this album for a long time. I wasn't sure what to expect and was hoping for the best. Boy was I surprised. This is a very good album. Sometimes after people have a string of bad luck they never seem to recover. But that's not the case with Mariah. She proved that she's back and staying for awhile. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" was much better than I expected. It's impressive because this could have been a complete disaster, but it wasn't. So many artists after taking a hiatus try to comeback and recapture their glory but find themselves unsuccessful and unable to keep up with what's current. Mariah doesn't have that problem. She escapes that with great production and songwriting. People really made a collective effort with this project. This is was great teamwork and focus can do for you. I hope some of the younger female artists take note of this. Sometimes things might look bad and may not be going your way, but if you really put your mind to something you can do it. Mariah proved that after 15 years, she's still one of the best in the game.
1401301010|4.0|I read this book in about a day and a half.  Found it hard to go to sleep because I wanted to keep reading!  Anthony's tale of misspent youth, drugs, and debauchery were both amusing and horrifying.  If you can't be a good example you can be a horror story (or something like that--can't remember the exact quote).  Have always been a fan of the Chilis music and love them now more than ever.  While later work hasn't received acclaim from critics I find a maturity and self-reflection in their last 2 cd's that wasn't present before.  Music aside, this book was a definite must-read for Chilis fans (and who isn't?).
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Comparisons to Beyonce are unfounded, but they were bound to happen upon the arrival of Mariah Carey's eighth proper album.  Of course, Carey's detractors need reminding that Mariah has been doing this since long before Beyonce's premiere on Star Search in baggy, neon colored clothing.  Miss Carey's latest outing has been heralded as the 'Return of the Voice', and it is.  Not only is Carey's voice lush, but it is still layered with the decadent whispers and powerful soul that it has always had, no matter how MOR oriented the material.  And seeing as it has already sold nearly 450,000 copies in its first week, proves that Mariah still posesses the ability to attract a large audience. <br /> <br />This is exactly the kind of music that Mariah should be doing.  Classy, yet sensual, raw and soulful, but still contemporary and slick.  Instead of her album relying on big name producers and collabos with the hottest talents in music, Carey instead decides to reach back to the sounds that inspired her.  And juding from the vibe of the album, Mariah infused her album with the elements of 70's soul; sparse arrangements and stellar vocals.  Her emancipation begins with the club banger 'It's Like That', a call-and-response, crunk induced declaration of freedom, where Carey confidently states 'It's a special occasion/Mimi's emancipation/A cause for celebration'.  It's a powerful statement laced with a delicious hip-hop backbeat. <br /> <br />'We Belong Together' is a throwback to those classic 80's slow jams that emitted passion and stirring, head bopping melodies.  Consider 'Shake It Off' one part Motown in the 60's, the other part a hip-hop layered brush off, where Mariah breaks free of an immature and uncaring lover. 'Get Your Number' is a whimsical slice of 80's inspired funk where Jermaine Dupri shows off his own vocal abilities to great affect. <br /> <br />'Mine Again' is a passionate, soul ballad reminiscent of the best of 70's soul music, and Mariah's vocals are fierce,but still infused with the subtlety that makes this standout track shimmer. 'Circles' is a mid-tempo, bluesy cut and Mariah's vocals are absolutely immaculate on this track.  <br /> <br />'Fly Like a Bird' is a lush, gospel gem further complimented by its live insturmentation and Carey's superb vocals. <br /> <br />If, after fourteen tracks of gorgeous ballads and funky mid-tempo cuts, you feel Mariah is in anyway trying to emulate overrated diva-in-training Beyonce, just take a look at the impact that Miss Carey has had on popular music.  Who else dared to challenge mainstream music with a combination of sultry r&b laced with hip-hop mixed with pop? 'The Emancipation of Mimi' signals the 'Return of the Voice' in a prodigious way.  It seems that Mariah has experienced the sweet taste of freedom, and the last true Diva is here to stay...

B00006LPER|4.0|A piano teacher superbly performed by Isabelle Huppert (one of my top favorite actress in the world), exhibits the ancient myth of Eros and Psiquis, and emerges with powerful force and dark poetry in this frustrated human being who, hidden on her art helmet, seems to watch how her best lifetime passed without any expectative. The cotidianity establishes in her life an unbearable repetition of a long catalogue of common places. Indeed, the obvious conclusion you perceive after she punishes that promising and talented pupil through the most miserable envy feeling and impotence. In her soul depths she knows her pupil will overpass her in a future not so distant.<br />But suddenly the passion appears and with it the Pandora Box will open with her cumulative sum of expected affection, sexual repressions and the wished love that came behind the masque of the oblivion.<br />She will play hard this role of victim and victimary. In her role of teacher the last profile is well known but she knows the time is brief and somehow as the famous Proust novel she intends to search desperately the missed time.<br />To be honest the camera is not to the same level than the performers. Huppert is overwhelming but the camera eye doesn't maintain the same level of required fierceness and mistakenly you can feel it. If you intend to change visual agression with the deepest insights of that troubled soul avid of love and consideration, we have big problem.<br />Think in Nagisa Oshima with the Empire Senses and you will realize that important device. The way you use your filmic language is even much more important perhaps tahn the same script if you want to accent certain issues to achieve your purpose. Otherwise you will obtain a serious artistic deficit when you analyze the final result.
0425170349|2.0|Well, mostly this novel is 899 pages of boredom. The plot centers around an anti-terrorist group based in England, comprised of primarily Americans and British commando types, with a few continental Europeans thrown in for good measure. This group quells one terrorist incident after another, setting the stage for a final encounter. Everything here is by and large predictable, a few surprises do await the reader. Tom Clancy wrote this novel circa 1999, obviously dated as you will see if you do decide to read it, being pre 911 is just a part of this. I found it long and dull, being punctuated by brief periods of action. A plodding writing style indeed. 899 pages...give me a break, if an author cannot get his ideas across in 400-500 pages he/she needs to get a better editor. Also, if you truly believe in the environmental movement and are cognisant of how we are harming the earth with our industrial way of life you will be disappointed with this novel as Clancy generally disparages environmentalists as extreme. I suspect Clancy may be a far right-wing neoconservative, just a guess on my part. But more to the point, this book is far too long and contains lots of filler, not recommended.

B0006SSOHC|2.0|to me this movie looked great in the previews and I always enjoy horror movies that critics give bad ratings to. But I agree with them this time. At first I thought I was going to sleep with the light on until I saw the ending. THE ENDING IS....... THERE ISN'T A REAL ENDING JUST A VICTIM BEING LOCKED IN A DARK ROOM. If you want to see a scary movie this isn't one to see unless you only like to watch the beginning of movies
B00005RYKV|5.0|Beat Takeshi provides another violent movie, whose purpose seems to be that violence begets violence, and ultimately it's a dead end.  The basic plot has Takeshi playing a yakuza forced to leave Japan upon the death of his boss.  He finds his half brother in LA pushing drugs rather than attending school.  Takeshi violently turns the small time crew into a major crime cartel. <br /> <br />Yakuza themes of loyalty to family and honor over life pervade the movie.  The omnipresent violence somehow avoids being gratuitous, perhaps because one realizes how more graphic it could have been.  Unlike traditional western shoot 'em ups, we are left with the aftermath instead of the fight scenes themselves.  At times it is hard to follow the plot and remember who is on whose sides, but perhaps that is the point.
B000002U9Y|4.0|Okay, let me start off with saying i'am a huge Pink Floyd fan. I love their music from piper at the gates of dawn,to the Division Bell.  <br /> <br /> A Saucerful of secrets is a great floyd album, but its lacking what floyd needed the most at that time, Syd Barrett. As you may know, syd was in terrible condition while recording this album. Roger waters was now thrown into Syds spot with a bit of help from Rick wright. Pretty much all the songs on this album is Roger trying to write like Syd. He is not using his artistic brilliance that he has. With the exception to STCFTHOTS.  <br /> <br /> Syd is infact on more than just Jugband blues, David Gilmour announced in an interview that Syd was on Set the controls for the heart of the sun, corporal clegg, let there be more light, and remember a day. <br /> <br />1.Let there be more light 7/10 perfect example of Roger trying to write like syd...good intro to a good album though. <br /> <br />2.Remember a Day 6/10 Syd influence...okay though. <br /> <br />3.Set the controls- 8/10 Heres Roger writing some original good material. <br /> <br />4.Corporal Clegg-9/10-Roger trying to write like Syd, but this is actually good.Funny too.Probably the best upbeat song on the album. <br /> <br />5.Saucerful of Secrets-6/10- Now heres floyd! When you take this song, then take the future Atom heart mother, then Echoes you can see that this song is where Floyd found there feet. <br /> <br />6.See saw-5/10 YAWN. This song was called \\"The most boring song I've ever heard bar two\\" while recording.  <br /> <br />7.Jubband Blues :-(  10/10 So sad. As you may know this is Syd's swan song with the floyd, such a sad yet cheerful way to end Syd's time in the sun. I love Syds work on Pipers, along with his two solo albums (which I highly recommend).
B000002J0P|5.0|Maybe you CAN get folk-rockier than \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", because THIS album is a true milestone in the annals of post-war pop culture. Crosby, Stills and Nash came from three excellent groups of the era of the late 60s/early seventies: The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and The Hollies, and created a group that was actually better than any of the three feeds! David Crosby was the smirking, mink hat-wearing lead singer of the Byrds, Stephen Stills was the elder-statesman/master songwriter for the Buffalo Springfield, (a group literally named after an earthmoving equipment company,) and Graham Nash was one of the elfin harmonizing voices of the Hollies, a British group whose music bore no resemblance to the country-flavored folk-rock of Stills' and Crosby's groups.<br /><br />When I first heard \\"Marrakesh Express\\", I could have sworn it was Simon & Garfunkel releasing a new single, post \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\". Imagine my shock when I heard that David Crosby and the Springfield's Stephen Stills had hooked up with the George Harrison-esque Nash to form the very first \\"supergroup\\", (others would follow, like Led Zeppelin, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Renaissance and Fleetwod Mac,) of the 70s.<br /><br />The harmonies on this album were what made CSN legendary....although there is a HUGE Buffalo Springfield influence as far as that's concerned...(they sounded NOTHING like the Byrds or the Hollies!) but it is the songwriting, (again, most of the best work is by Stills,) that really makes it stand out.<br /><br />Stills' \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" is a song praising and cajoling the great Judy Collins, a lover of his at the time. It is THE anthem of the album, and the one most DJs slap in the old console when they want a hit of ol' CS&N. His \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" is an easygoing declension of what two lovers are to each other. \\"You Don't Have To Cry\\" and \\"49 Bye-Byes\\" are the sod-kickers on the album, immediately catchy and full of Stills' trademarks, (intricate guitar-picking and aw-shucks vocals.) Crosby is a VERY close second with his songwriting, collaborating with Stills on \\"Wooden Ships\\", having also written \\"Guinevere\\" and \\"Long Time Gone\\". He easily knocks right on Stills' door with his talent as a tunesmith. Nash, on the other had, produces one of the most sickening rock tunes I've ever heard, with \\"Lady of the Island\\", an extremely gooey number that makes him sound incredibly conceited and corny. However, he must have been listening to Crosby's and Stills' jam sessions very closely, because \\"Pre-Road Downs\\", (even the TITLE sounds like something Crosby or Stills would have come up with,) pays an obvious homage to his bandmates. He almost redeems himself with this and \\"Marrakesh Express\\", probably the OTHER trademark CS&N tune besides \\"Suite\\". Yes, \\"Marrakesh\\" is the song I thought was a Simon & Garfunkel tune initially.<br /><br />I wonder just what possessed Stills and Crosby to recruit Nash....the Hollies were British...VEDDY British....fond of baroque guitar work, musical sampling from former British holdings like Jamaica and other, purely European influences in their music, while S & C were EXTREMELY American in their sound, both in their former groups and their songwriting on this and the \\"Deja Vu\\" albums. Was Roger McGuinn busy? Dewey Martin? Jimmy Page? Why Nash?<br /><br />Anyway....this album, probably more than any other, symbolized the whole \\"Love\\" generation, encapsulating the folk-country flavor favored by the lion's share of music-lovers back then...not to mention a sanitized \\"hippie\\" image that made them palatable to parents and \\"weekenders\\" who had one toe in the establishment world and another in the counterculture. No matter what walk of life you come from, you'll find yourself tapping your foot to the rockers on this album and singing along to the harmonies...<br /><br />And your harlequin will most definitely hover nearby....ls.)

B000002UA0|5.0|The debut album from Pink Floyd is in my opinon they're greatest work but very different then the pink floyd people became to know them as.  This is where it all started with there founder/songwriter/frontman Syd Barrett.  Syd wrote great lyrics and great music which in this album is probably the best debut album in history.  Every song on here is great.  The albums starts of with the spacey Astromony Domine which is one of the albums and pink floyd's best songs.  It gets even better from there With Lucifer Sam, Matilda Mother, Flaming and a couple of intrumentals Pow R Toch H and Instellar Overdrive.  the later half has equaly great songs like The Scarecrow, The Gnome this one's pretty funny, and everyone's favorite Bike.  If you haven't heard this album before click on buy now because you are in for a treat but be warned this is no Dark Side of the Moon.  As I said this album is excellent a pure masterpiece, don't let anyone tell you different.  It's definetly an essential.  Trust me buy the album you'll thank me for it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember seeing the ads for this innovative program when it was first being aired and thinking it was something I wanted to watch. However, due to work committments, I missed the first couple episodes and never found it again. Then, I heard it was cancelled after a half season. Well, soon reports of a fan following of this program developed (similar to Star Trek) and when I saw the complete series on dvd, I decided to buy it. Boy, am I glad I did.<br />Firefly unfortunately came out during the reality tv craze. It is a fine program with excellent characters and stories, a wonderful premise, superb acting and cast, fine effects, and a great production team. Watching the 2 hour pilot on dvd and the shows in order certainly built the characters and the plot. Apparently, Fox, when originally airing this, didn't air the episodes in the order that made sense losing a fair number of viewers along the way. This program is one of the best sci-fi series ever aired. Unfortunately, it died too soon. But, like the Phoenix, it is rising from the ashes and I am eagerly anticipating the feature movie Serenity in the fall.<br />One thousand plus reviews can't be wrong: if you enjoy good stories, action, humor, and a little science fiction, delve into Firefly. You may be pleasantly surprised.
B000001EC1|4.0|This is a pretty good collection of Bon Jovi's best tunes up to this point in their career.  The only problem with it is it is missing the tune She Don't Know Me from the first record, which I feel is the best song off that record, even better than Runaway.  From what I've heard the only reason the song does not appear hear is that Jon did not write it, and didn't really want to include it because it was written by someone outside of the band.  Other than that ommission this is a strong collection of their best worthy of your time and money.
B000063V8S|4.0|While not firmly in the four-star realm due to one too many episodes involving what an office colleague characterized as \\"soapy\\" premises (in other words, episodes that centered around a crew member falling in love with an alien character, with the viewer eventually having to trudge through all the tiresome reasons such a love affair couldn't work out), season four of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" nevertheless still barely secures a four-star recommendation from me due to its inclusion of a variety of excellent episodes by anyone's standard.  One of these is \\"The Drumhead\\", which is one of the most compelling courtroom dramas I've ever seen on TV or in the movies, science fiction or not.  Two others are the terrific \\"The Best of Both Worlds II\\", which concluded the season three cliffhanger involving the Borg, and \\"Family\\", an excellent character piece showing how Captain Picard slowly recovers from his traumatic experiences as a Borg abductee.  There are also some great Klingon episodes, especially the one leading into the season four cliffhanger. The extra features on the last disc are- as in previous sets- interesting, entertaining, and well organized.  If you've been discovering these episodes on DVD and want to know if you should keep going and pick up this set, by all means do so.  And you know, even the soapy episodes aren't all THAT bad.

This movie is WHORTH buying it!!!  <br /> <br />One of the reviewers above said that the movie contains to many sterotypes, it's not THAT true!! but I think he meant to the movie \\"Don't be a Menace\\".  <br /> <br />The stereotypes in this film are that the black people are VERY,VERY dangerous and few are educated (this is even worst than the Hollywood movies), black people addicted to sex, black people always cursing and black people always hearing Hip Hop music (this is one of the WORST and ANNOYING sterotypes ever). <br /> <br />The movie is also blaming other people for the problems in the hood and I don't understand why the \\"N\\" word is a horrible and racist word if they keep saying that all the time!!!  <br /> <br />P.S: Don't get me wrong! This is one of the best movies I ever seen! Im addicted to it!!! and when I said that stuf abou Hip Hop I meant that not all the black people hear Hip Hop. <br /> <br />ADIOS!!  <br /> <br />  <br />
0767834739|2.0|Now, the first Resident Evil movie, I didn't see.  But hey, I've got friends who liked it, so I went along to watch Apocalypse with them.  They all liked it, and they can't seem to understand why I didn't like this movie as much as they did.  Yes, surprisingly, the movie is close to the games, but it's cheesy and forgets that while it's a movie, things do need to make sense before you can mess them up.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at least, that the movie does manage to help me learn the gist of what happened in the first one.  Now I don't have to watch it.<br /><br />But the first problem with the movie is that it jumps into the plot right away.  No build up (people say this is scary?  all the good horror movies have some sort of build up and suspense, for an example: watch Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\"), which makes the film not scary at all.<br /><br />The action sequences were tiring at most.  Too flashy and perfect.  It also seems that characters don't have to have knowlegde of where characters are to find them.  For example, Jill and company are fighting off a group of lickers in the church when Alice comes riding through the cathedral on a motorcyle.  She's completely in gear and ready to go, doesn't sustain any wounds from the glass, manages to flip off the bike and kill all the lickers.  But she somehow knew Jill and company were there.  How?  Forget how cool her entrance was!  And then she manages to KNOW them all?<br /><br />I'll give the movie this though.  Anyone who was a big fan of Resident Evil 3 will appreciate the costume design for Jill and will REALLY enjoy seeing Nemesis on camara.  Even though the plot twist at the end is predictable (OH MY GOD!  Nemesis is Allice's old partner?  you mean we WEREN'T supposed to see that coming?), it was pulled off pretty well.  It was also stupid that Nemesis ends up helping our main protagonists through a disneylike \\"Yeah, we used to be buds\\" moment.  In the game Nemesis was a relentless bio-weapon that had no feelings or emotions.<br /><br />Really, I'm not sure why this is such a popular movie among my peers.  It's mindless, and the parts that should be funny aren't.  There was nothing really memorable about the film.  For an action film it's shallow, weak, and the main action heroine is much too perfect.  Was John McClane in Die Hard perfect?  Nope, he still got wounded.<br /><br />For horror, the movie isn't scary.  Too much of it is ruined by building up too much suspesne.  It comes off as more of a \\"OK, let's take bets.  Who is going to die next?\\"<br /><br />Really, this isn't a \\"horrible\\" movie, just a \\"bad\\" one.  Go on and buy it if you enjoy a lot of mindless action.  But if you're like me, mindless action DOES have to make a little bit of sense, or else it isn't \\"mindless\\" it's just \\"stupid\\".ss bio-weapon that had no feelings or emotions.  <br /> <br />Really, I'm not sure why this is such a popular movie among my peers.

B0007Y4USW|1.0|My goodness, why is she STILL doing that high pitched stuff that ruined the beautiful voice she had in her early years?  Even my dog knows that is what killed her ability to reach any more high notes.  When she gets past the highest note she can sing (which ain't that high) it is whispers.  Lots of whispers and now rap to cover her shortcomings. Don't care for rap  I absolutely love her first 4 or 5 cd's, but this last stuff is terrible.  It makes me cringe when I hear that high pitched stuff here.  I can sing her early stuff better than she can now and can easily hit those high notes and I'm no professional.  Mariah:  a word to the wise...stop the high stuff..take a few years off and sell real estate.  Then go back to your \\"boyz to men\\" days........that song you sang with them at the Grammys was awesome.  Sorry.
B00079ZACM|5.0|Obviously the movie's magnificence is a given, and my copy is crystal clear. What surprised me was the commentary on the backside of the DVD case.<br /><br />\\"With cannon fire ignited the North African skies, the British calvary charges into battle to capture the stratetic city of Khartoum. In the midst of the devastating carnage, a horrified officer (Clements) resigns from his post.\\"<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />The guy resigned in England and his unit left without him. Whoever wrote that commentary doesn't deserve to write another one.<br /><br />It takes nothing away from the movie, but it seems amazing such erroneous commentary would accompany this great movie.<br /><br />- Roger Carlson<br /><br />Costa Mesa, Ca. 92627
0517548232|4.0|\\"Economic In One Lesson\\" is a great way to learn the basic principles of Economics. This book covers every thing you need to know about Economics in a simple, clear, and short matter. Henry Hazlitt explains about 26 common economic fallalies from the broken window fallicies to the assault on saving.  <br /> <br />Being a collage student that is taking basic economics this has been a great tool for an introduction to the subject. Henry Hazlitt touch on every main point that my teacher goes in detail in class.  <br /> <br />Economics in One Lesson is great book for college students that are enetering into the Economic world. keep in mind that you need to read this book with an open mind and know that things always change.
1400034779|3.0|This book is both something more and something less than the Agatha Christie-type novel set in Africa that I was expecting. It is something more in that many relatively minor characters a fully developed. For example, our heroine's father's life story is told and it is both interesting and moving. The book is something less in that there is no Agatha Christie-type mystery here. Certainly there are various mysteries solved as individual client's needs are addressed but there is no primary mystery that makes up the plot. Further, the reader will be able to solve many of the minor mysteries before our heroine does. <br /> <br />As a small business owner, I can attest that this book does more-or-less accurately address the basic concerns of small business owners (as, indeed, All Creatures Great and Small does). <br /> <br />I would have preferred the addition of a locked room murder that has stymied the police or some such.
B00079HZUM|5.0|I agree w/ most of the other reviews except I feel the need to point out that I don't believe that Kynaston is necessarily a \\"gay character\\".  I'm not sure he is gay at all.   That's why his attraction to Maria is plausible. Maybe he is gay, maybe he's not.  I don't think that it really matters.  The fact is that Kynaston said it himself that he was taken off the streets, fed and educated and train to act by his \\"tutor...who liked all the pretty, pretty boys\\".  I think Kynaston's sexuality has been twisted and pulled and remolded over and over like silly putty.  Nothing is cut and dry in this film regarding sexual roles.  In some ways it almost gives us a \\"missing link\\" gender that is no longer a part of our culture.  In the film Kynaston has focused his entire self on being an actor who plays women's roles. This is not just what he does but rather \\"who\\" he is. After recuperating from a severe beating he is rejected by his lover, George Villiers, who claims that his attraction was not to Kynaston the man but rather the female roles he played, Villiers would imagine himself \\"inside\\" Desdemona or poor, poor Ophelia when he had sex w/ Kynaston. He tells Kynaston that he does not who he (Kynaston) is and does not think that Kynaston know either. <br /> By Kynaston losing his place upon the stage he lost more than just his livelihood and social standing (that in and of itself could crush an a average person) but rather himself entirely.  In the aforementioned sexual role-playing scene he inadvertently ruins the moment by inquiring \\"how does your Desdemona die at the end?\\" to Maria.  Maria jumps up and quite eloquently states \\"your tutor has done you a great disservice Mr. Kynaston, he taught you how to speak like a women and move like a women but he did not teach you to feel like a woman and love like a woman...he has taken a you and trapped you in a women's form and left you to die\\".  Quite simply with out the acting he is just a confused boy that has never grow to be aproper man \\"...for he was kept in a basement w/14 other boys, and not allowed to wear a dress for 3 years nor a woman's wig for 4 yrs, not until he could prove that he had removed every possible remnant of maleness from his very being\\".  Crudup's Kynaston tore me to shreds and the comedic moments through out the film did nothing to detract from Kynaston's deconstruction after his emotional bubble is popped and he is forced discover some remnant of what he once was and what he could have been had it not been for the unusual circumstances of his childhood.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Here's my review: I don't care what f****ng \\"critics\\" and brianwashed \\"fans\\" say, this is the most exciting and anti-commercial U2 album they've ever made. Their last must have masterpiece. Period!.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|What's wrong with all of the \\"1-stars\\" that this film received by my fellow reviewers and the elite media is a blind adherence to political propaganda. The naysayers of Team America say that, among many things, that the neo-conservatives get a free ride, Kim Jong Il doesn't look half as vile as the Hollywood actors guilty of \\"having opinions,\\" etc. They ignore the fact that the team receives commands from a computer which is an obvious play on Karl Rove/Dick Cheney and their roles in the administration. There are many situations where Parker and Stone parody the right. <br /> <br />If these critics could take off their PETA t-shirts and Green Peace membership personas for 2 seconds, they could see that the movie is actually quite funny. The songs are extremely well-done and the movie not only satirizes current events, but Hollywood and many high-key films (Star Wars, Pearl Harbor -- which sucked horribly --, and others). The parody is well done and while the jokes and dialog can be very childish, the fact that it's coming from a puppet with inherent irony in seemingly simple statements is astounding. <br /> <br />Again, if you can remove yourself from PETA for an hour and a half (and while you're at it, have a nice steak) you will find the hilarity that is Team America. <br /> <br />And as an end-note, while Team America has many conservative overtones, the main parody of the movie, the U.S. military as world police, is an attack on the so called neo-conservatives. They are depicted as non-caring and simple. I'm a Bush voter and was able to see the satire, and even humor, at that side of the debate. <br /> <br />If you're going to complain about the single conservative-toned film which also takes shots at it's own mistakes in public policy, you might want to go see any other Hollywood film with an abundance of comfortable political overtones that may satisfy your desire for the easy, non-challenging road your life has already taken you. For Green Peace and PETA members, The Day After Tomorrow won't challenge any of your dear political point of views and will be sure not to cause you to think about anything outside of your comfortable and blind political allegiances.
B0006399FS|2.0|They've lost it. No imagination, no new ideas, just recycling older material. Same lyrical treatment, same production skills. Some of their '90s albums even sound more modern. This proves two things: 1) They've run out of creativity, 2) They're just in it for the money now. Sad.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones has a fantastic voice and she has created some lovely, mellow music. I can understand why she has so many fans and why this album received so many awards. <br /> <br />However, it is not really for me. It is too smooth, too polished, too nice and while the material is good, sometimes very good, it is not great. Norah Jones does not (yet) possess the sort of voice that can transcend the material. Yes, her voice is very good and has the potential to get even better but at the moment she does not compare to the true great artists of the genre: Billie, Ella etc. <br /> <br />Wonderful if you like easy listening but I prefer something with a bit more edge.  <br /> <br />
B00014TJ6Q|4.0|1976's THIRTY THREE & 1/3 was a reasonably good album from George Harrison that spawned 2 top 40 hits & sold well enough. However, most of that album was tinged in bitterness at having lost his battle with the writers of \\"He's So Fine\\" over plagiarizing it for his own \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (\\"This Song\\" was one way of venting his anger). After that album, George took the next 2 years off, spending most of his time traveling & attending his beloved auto races. Supposedly, George was having a case of writer's block shortly after THIRTY THREE & 1/3, and was not sure if he would ever regain his main line. However, trips to Hawaii & the Virgin Islands at last got his juices flowing, and in 1979, GEORGE HARRISON appeared, its self-titled nature hinting at a new beginning & George tapping into a fresh vein of creativity.<br /><br />Having just married his second wife Olivia & witnessing the birth of his son Dhani, George was clearly in a much better mood this time around, and the sunny weather of his island jaunts also helped to bring up his spirits & inspire him creatively. For someone as upbeat about the eventual savior of the world, a song like the opening \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\" (with guitar by George's pal, Eric Clapton) comes naturally from George. He points out that acheiving peace is never easy or quick, but as he mentions \\"It only takes time\\". The closing \\"If You Believe\\" also encourages the listener to keep his chin up & that believing in oneself will save the day. At a brief 3 minutes, this is one song that could have easily followed \\"Blow Away\\" as a single, for it is everything a hit should be. Those two songs are the only times George is in the role of world peacemaker. The rest are much more personal & introspective.<br /><br />The glow of his new marriage & family obviously had George smiling bright for Olivia & Dhani appears to have been the inspiration for songs like \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" (which Olivia suggested as a Spanish-type number), \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" & \\"Soft Touch\\". George clearly took the old creative saying of \\"Write about what you know\\" to heart, and that helped him recharge his batteries. Some songs like \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" could be interpreted as being to God, but the fact they work on a secular level makes them the most successful.<br /><br />The new attitude George gained is transferred all throughout GEORGE HARRISON as the nature theme of some songs indicate. \\"Here Comes The Moon\\" was George's (un)intentional sequel to \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", and as he describes in the album's liner notes (taken from his autobiography I ME MINE), he was utterly entranced by the sunsets and moonrises of Hawaii. Maybe all of us could use a trip like that to brighten our lives.<br /><br />\\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" also was directly inspired by the surroundings of Hawaii, with George using his own \\"Deep Blue\\" as inspiration for creating a yin to its yang (if you gotta steal, steal from the best). Even George himself agreed that the lyrics are a bit flowery, but maybe those \\"magic mushrooms\\" he had encouraged him to revisit his latter years in the Beatles when one could not help but feel the need to take a trip.<br /><br />Something as simple as a leak in George's house inspired the album's top 20 hit \\"Blow Away\\", truly one of George's finest singles. While the sunny Adult Contemporary vibe of the song may have people thinking George had gone \\"too soft\\", once they start smiling at hearing the song, they will get it. Through all his occasional preaching about world affairs, George boils it all down pretty much into \\"Blow Away\\", and as he points out in the notes, \\"The only thing we really have to work at in this life is how to manifest love\\".<br /><br />It was only a matter of time before George's love of racing inspired a song, and that became \\"Faster\\". Inspired by racecar driver & friend Jackie Stewart, it is likely this song in particular helped to get George back on the songwriting track again, especially since he mentioned 1977 wasmostly an off year. The chorus is by far one of George's catchiest, making it a mystery why it did not do as well as a single like \\"Blow Away\\".<br /><br />Finally, there is the song that George held on to for over a decade, \\"Not Guilty\\". Written during the time of THE WHITE ALBUM, when the Beatles were slowly but surely growing apart, George had even recorded it at the time, with that version making it onto the THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY 3. However, maybe it was considered to below the knuckle to issue at the time, but after enough time passed, George could revisit it & record it for GEORGE HARRISON. The song seems to reflect the Beatles' meditation jaunt in India, where George came home the biggest convert & all the others thought it to be of little impact. Maybe this was the element that soured George on continuing as a Beatle. \\"Not Guilty\\" is the only time on GEORGE HARRISON that detracts from the album's bouncy, upbeat feel, though the song's lighthearted attitude is still in keeping with it.<br /><br />Again, the bonus tracks on the Dark Horse reissues come up short, with only a demo of \\"Here Comes The Moon\\" to present on GEORGE HARRISON, and it pales in comparison to the splendor of the final product. Clearly, there are some more lost gems in the vaults because it almost never happens that an artist records just the 10 songs that make up the album he releases.<br /><br />Apparently, the time George Harrison spent just living life & not caring about music for a while helped him regain his enthusiasm for the thing that he had spent his life doing. Of course, that new career of smiles would not last long as the behind-the-scenes events involving this album's follow-up would indicate. Until then, GEORGE HARRISON showed that the only thing he needed to recharge his creative fuse was to look around & see all the good things happening to him.mostly an off year.

0064430227|5.0|This book follows the adventure of Harold and his purple crayon. Harold draws things with his purple crayon and then interacts with the things that he has drawn. The text is simple but the story is strong - the illustrations are basic (they are just pictures that you could draw with a purple crayon!) but very effective. <br /> <br />Great fun and very stimulating. When I read it with my son (4) after having forgotten about the book for a while it provoked a huge number of quite complicated questions about the nature of reality and imagination. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.  <br /> <br />
B00005BJ9W|5.0|For those that only recall \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and all the countless songs Duran Duran had on the radio, one can easily forget how different, unique and innovative a band like Duran really was in the early 1980s. Duran Duran were no doubt the first \\"new romantic\\" or \\"new wave\\" outfit that bands today like The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes, The Bravery, Interpol and the like are influenced by/imitating with a great degree of success. (Who said the '80s were never cool? The joke is on them now!) <br /> <br />This second album by Duran Duran showcases both elements of early Duran Duran: the dark, brooding and eerie \\"new romantic\\" sound they mastered on their first album and seen here on \\"The Chauffeur\\", \\"New Religion\\" and \\"Lonely In Your Nightmare\\", as well as the masterful pop music found in the tremendous rush of radio hits: \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", \\"Rio\\" and \\"Save a Prayer\\". The relevance of the Duran sound has been vindicated by the current rush of today's top acts to say Duran Duran was an influence. The songs on RIO sound as fresh today as they were then on the first days of MTV. <br /> <br />Some often forget Duran Duran was indeed a talented and instrumentally gifted outfit. The rhythm section of Roger Taylor (drums) and John Taylor (bass) are at long last getting their dues for the true talent they possess. Andy Taylor is an underrated guitarist who shines with both his delicate, atmospheric tones and what quickly became more urgent and rocking sounds displayed on this album and beyond, and Nick Rhodes does just the same thing, only with keyboards. Finally, Simon LeBon is perhaps the most brash and over the top front man since Mick Jagger, and that fit perfectly into the Duran style here and with what was to come, as it was the RIO period that Duran became the kings of MTV. <br /> <br />Many of the songs on the RIO album remain highlights in a live Duran Duran concert setting in 2005. You like The Killers? You like the rush of \\"new wave\\" influenced music currently underway? This is a great place to start to see where it all began.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Also recommended by Duran Duran for modern day \\"new wave\\" fans: albums like \\"Duran Duran\\" (their debut album), \\"Astronaut\\" (their excellent 2004 comeback), \\"The Singles 81-85\\" and \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\". <br />
0790729369|5.0|When I saw this film ten years ago, I was still in high school, and my classmates didn't understand why I loved it. I guessed I am just an emotional person and more mature, so that I could appreciate this \\"emotionally impacting, romantic, and beautiful film\\". I am glad to have this film in my DVD collection now. This may not have been Meryl Streep's most acclaimed role, but it's on my favorite list, because her portrayal of an Iowa housewife Francesca Johnson is flawless. She uses body language so effective here( as well as in The Hours) to convey her her inner emotions, and once again she proved to the world that she's best at imitating an accent. This film scored her 10th Oscar nomination!<br /><br />It's a simple story about love and romance arriving into Francesca's mundune married life again when a world-travelling photographer(Robert Kincaid/Clint Eastwood) lured her into photographing her in the local sights. During the few days spent together with Robert, she fell alive again and they fall in love before he leaves town, and she's being persuaded to ran away with him....<br /><br />Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are so mesmerizing together. This is probably his best triple-duty effort as actor, producer, and director.

This collection of hits showcases both elements of Duran Duran: the early dark, brooding and eerie \\"new romantic\\" sound they mastered on their first and second albums, as well as the masterful pop music found on their third album and all of their singles.  The relevance of the Duran sound has been vindicated by the current rush of today's top acts to say Duran Duran was an influence.

GREATEST also highlights the output of Duran in the 1990s, including the two (Top 10) 1993 hits \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone\\", which are just as classic as \\"A View to a Kill\\" and \\"Planet Earth\\".  The late 1990s Top 40 hit \\"Electric Barbarella\\" is also showcased, and is worthy of inclusion here.  Even \\"Serious\\", a single off of the disastrous early '90s album Liberty fits right in.      Some often forget Duran Duran was indeed a talented and instrumentally gifted outfit.

What's missing?  This should have been a double CD set.  Classic album tracks like \\"New Religion\\", \\"The Chauffeur\\", \\"Careless Memories\\", \\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\\", \\"The Seventh Stranger\\", \\"Anyone Out There\\", \\"Friends of Mine\\", \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" and \\"Nightboat\\" are all missing.  Even latter day singles like \\"Perfect Day\\" (featuring a then one-off return by Roger Taylor on drums for this 1995 track), \\"Do You Believe in Shame\\" and \\"Out of My Mind\\" deserve recognition.  And if the collection was ever updated, \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"What Happens Tomorrow\\", from their 2004 comeback album Astronaut, both deserve inclusion here as they both received radio airplay.

0553802534|4.0|This book DOES literally travel faster than a speeding bullet, exploding from the first pages and never letting up for a minute. When Catherine was a child, she was abducted, held in the dark in an underground prison and sexually molested for a month. After she escaped from her tormentor, who was jailed for 25 years, she appeared to have made a good recovery but secretly continued in her role as an abused victim. She married the son of a prominent and very powerful judge who didn't approve of the marriage and who encouraged his son to beat and torment his wife and young son. State Trooper Bobby Dodge is a member of the local SWAT team, trained to evaluate hostage situations and react accordingly, so when he is called upon to shoot dead Catherine's abusive husband who was holding her at gunpoint, he is astonished to find that the judge  is bringing a civil case of murder against him. Meanwhile, the judge has also used his authority to obtain the release of Catherine's kidnapper, the psycopathic killer and torturer, and uses him to try to gain custody of his grandson. It's a pacy and exciting book which moves so quickly that you've finished it sooner than you'd wish...a great read!
0800141865|4.0|This film chonicles the rise and fall of Larry Flynt from his poor, humble beginnings to wealthy and powerful media tycoon, and the tragedies that shortly befall him after his precipitous rise to wealth and fame.<br /><br />However, he is a tycoon peddling more and more explicit smut to a conflicted populace used to Playboy and Penthouse. Hustler magazines sell out at the newstands while others watch his success with a growing sense of dread, since he is a threat to their conservative morality and views. But Flynt argues that if God himself created a woman's body then it shouldn't be obscene no matter what the religious and moral types say, and that futhermore, he should be protected by our Constitutional right to free speech.<br /><br />Eventually Flynt is vindicated as the case eventually goes to the Supreme Court, which upholds Flynt's right to peddle smut under the First Amendment.<br /><br />In this very well done scene, at this point there is a witty and intelligent exchange between justices Scalia and Stevens and Flynt's lawyer Isaacman, played by Ed Norton, who does a great job here. I believe this might have been Norton's breakthrough or perhaps first film, but I'm not certain of that. But this is the moral climax of the film in Flynt's ultimate vindication by the Supreme Court itself.<br /><br />The film also doesn't shrink from showing the dark side of Flynt's life and character, especially in portraying his erratic and eccentric behavior during much of the film. There are several other events and issues that get addressed, such as the shooting that left him a paraplegic, his religious conversion, and his despotic ways with his top management and occasionally seemingly arbritary decisions as president and CEO.<br /><br />And in his most self-destructive bent, he consistently antagonizes the judges in his court cases and finally  gets thrown into a psychiatric hospital for 15 months for contempt of court during the trial resulting from his portrayal of Jerry Falwell in Hustler cartoon.<br /><br />More destructive financially was that shortly after Hustler magazine's rise, he gets religious himself and starts injecting religion and morality into Hustler's approach, with an attendant drop in sales. Finally Flynt gets thrown in jail by the judge for contempt of court, after which his wife reverses Flynt's religious direction and they go back to being smut peddlers while he's in prison.<br /><br />And in the initial court trial for smut, Flynt taunts the judge before his sentencing by saying the court hasn't made a single intelligent decision so far and he doesn't expect one now, and so the judge sentences him to 25 years. Fortunately, this is overthrown on appeal after 6 months.<br /><br />By the way, the TV version is missing some of the more explicit dialog and a few scenes that I remember from the original movie. For example, Flynt isn't shown wearing the t shirt that said \\"F_ck this court\\" during the slander trial. However, there is considerable nudity, at least from the waist up.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie with fine performances by Harrelson and Norton on the rise and fall and eventual return of the media tycoon who pushed the limits of the publishing industry to new highs (or perhaps lows) and who was ultimately vindicated by the Supreme Court in a landmark case.re destructive financially was that shortly after Hustler magazine's rise, he gets religious himself and starts injecting religion and morality into Hustler's approach, with an attendant drop in sales.

B000065V1V|3.0|I wouldn't really call myself a Bowie \\"fan\\". I don't own any of his albums, but I like quite a few of his tracks over the years between \\"Space Oddity\\" and the \\"Let's Dance\\" album, so I thought this would be worth having when I had a chance to pick this up as a promo during a stint as a record store clerk.<br /><br />This Bowie album shows him making further attempts to incorporate more electronic elements into his songs, more as techno \\"flourishes\\" than a real attempt to try and put his music into clubs awash with day-glo wearing ravers.<br /><br />Overall, I found this album fairly listenable, but not really with much that \\"leapt out\\" at me. I have found that the tracks \\"settle in\\" more with repeat listens, so it could be that in a few years my estimation of it will climb, but for now it's only a (slightly) above average CD to me.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"Slip Away\\" reminded me of older Bowie in sound (70s era).The lyrics are a tribute to a (somewhat obscure? I'd never heard of it and had to Dogpile the reference) 70s-80s era kids show that apparently used rockers as guests (Bowie, it seems visited show as guest in the AUDIENCE, not as performer..see [...] \\"Cactus\\", a Pixies cover, was a good listen as was single \\"Slow Burn\\", though I think the better choice would clearly have been \\"Everyone Says 'Hi'\\" which was the most immediately catchy tune and one that might have had more universal appeal beyond the typical Bowie fanbase (as his \\"Let's Dance\\" material did).<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Many are talking up the Neil Young cover on \\"I've Been Waiting for You\\" but I didn't find it very exciting. \\"Afraid\\" also didn't really spark any interest.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is not probably indispensable for casual Bowie fans like me who really only like the scattered song or two over his career. If that's you, you'll probably be fine with just getting the \\"Best of Bowie\\" doubledisc (ASIN B00006JYI7) or \\"Changesbowie\\" if you want just a single disc (ASIN B000034DF1)<br /><br />If you're a bigger Bowie fan, you'll probably at least want to take the time to see if a friend or the local library has a copy to hear.

B0001LJC2K|3.0|I was watching late night Sunday television the other night and I came across an infomercial for these guys. It was quite a welcome surprise because the only other show on was reruns of X-Files. Any way I spent the next twenty or so minutes under the mistaken belief that this was Radio Head and the members of the band had under gone expensive appearance altering surgical operations. In the world of music, you have to deal with whatever's already out there. It's okay to be influenced by a great band; however, these guys are just totally/blatantly ripping off Radio Head. The sad thing is that even though they're ripping them off they sound even better than Radio Head. They probably could write some really good original music if they wanted to.
B00005AREQ|4.0|This album is very interesting. It is a blues,rock,jazz and funk guitar album. The songs are all instrumental and feature some great guitar work from one of the greats, Jeff Beck. Jeff Beck explores many different types of music and blends them together and the results is fantastic. The best songs are \\"Freeway Jam\\", \\"Diamond Dust\\" and his tribute to the late great master of the Telecaster Roy Buchanan, called \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\". Monumental guitarmanship from Jeff Beck.
B000089RVR|5.0|I absolutely loved Dido's second albumn \\"Life For Rent\\". Her first albumn featured several somewhat depressing songs, but this albumn sort of lightened up a little bit. Unlike the previous albumn, there wasn't a very strong hit single like \\"Thank You\\", however, all the songs are excellently produced and performed in this albumn. I especially enjoyed \\"White Flag\\", \\"Mary's in India\\" and \\"See you When You'are 40\\". This albumn also put more emphasis on Dido's great voice. The amount of instrument beats are reduced so you could hear her voice better. Dido's voice is simply amazing.  <br /> <br />Go buy this albumn today and don't miss out on the hidden track at the end either! <br /> <br />
B00004THAY|3.0|There are several good songs on this album such as \\"Three O'Clock Blues\\", \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\", \\"Key to the Highway\\" (If you want the best version of Key to the Highway it's on the Derk and The Dominos- Layla album which was also clapton's band) and \\"Worried Life Blues\\". But i expected much better from two of the greatest guiatars to have ever lived.

The Most Overrated and Pathetic Death Metal band in history.  For real stuff, listen to Vader, Malevolent Creation, Possessed, Morbid Angel (even bad Morbid Angel is better then this), etc.  This is stuff that Serial Killers jack off to.  Speaking of Serial Killers, Macabre is good too.  Good Death Metal has lyrics that aren't thought up in 5 minutes, aren't the exact same album repeated over and over, has great guitar solos (these guys suck), and a better drummer (this guy is average at best, check out Vader), and better yet, has a vocalist that has range, volume and can actually annunciate words.  Hope this helped or ticked you off.  Pressing the helpful or not helpful button, either way makes me happy.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I think this was the album that the Music industry needed right now. There's not too much going on in R&B for the moment. A lot of your big names are either working on albums or are out on tour. So the timing was right for \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\"  <br /> <br />One thing that stands out is her strong lyrics. She's one of the most competent and cohesive songwriters. She backs the fun songs up with substance. And she's been consistently great about that throughout the years. Her voice only enhances the material which makes it come off even better. That's where she really soars above some of her younger peers. As far as R&B females go, only Alicia Keys has displayed the same level of maturity and aptitude. No wonder Mariah has sold over 100 million albums. If you look through the lyrics, she's a good storyteller. There's greater rhythm and timing to her words. And when they get attached to the music, it becomes classic. <br /> <br />When you listen to \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" it's obvious that there's really something special there. It's apparent that she was meant to stand out above so many others. I don't think her comeback is an accident. It seems rather purposeful. Mariah made such a huge impact back in 1990, perhaps another reintroduction to the music world was necessary. People had forgotten why she had been so successful and had chosen instead to focus on rumors. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" brings the music back to the foreground. And that's exactly where it deserves to be. A talent like hers should be celebrated whenever possible. There may be others out there with more awards, but Mariah has always been one of the most talented female singers and will forever be. If God had a greatest hits list, I'm sure Mariah would be somewhere near the top.  <br />
B00005JNTZ|5.0|\\"Yes, I do. And I also take cash.\\"    Don't worry, your cash will be well-spent. Veronica Mars is the only television show I have ever become obsessed about. I have convinced over 20 people to watch it, and they have all fallen in love with it. You will not regret buying this dvd and catching up (however you may choose to do so) with season 2. Veronica Mars is, as Joss Whedon summed up so perfectly, the Best. Show. Ever. Great writing, great acting, funny and dark, snarky and sarcastic. Veronica Mars is love.
B0000648WZ|1.0|A tolerable action movie worth viewing once.  Otherwise it just goes to promogate the myth that Heinlein was a facist.  For someone who has read the book, the director either refuses to get Heinlein's point due to personal issues on the subject matter or he is a truly dense individual.
B00079HZUM|5.0|This is one you will have to see.  You will either like it or not.  It's pretty much that simple.  I thought it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Wonderfully acted.  Funny and sad all at once.
B00005JNQ8|1.0|Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations. She speaks Spanish, French, and \\"Koo\\".  When she leaves her flute in a soundbooth and goes back for it, she overhears (in Koo, of course) the plot to assassinate Zuwani, the president of Matoba (or something like that, it's all made up).  She reports this, and Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is assigned to investigate her (not the assassination, just her for reporting the call).  Keller's floozy wife died two weeks prior, but he comes back to work, looking all dark and brooding, as Penn always does no matter what.  His wife apparently left him many times, running off with other men, BUT, she always comes back to him, and she was coming back this time.  But as the guy she ran off with was driving her to the airport, he wrecked the car, killing them both. So Keller is mooning over his immature, disloyal wife, who was just going to leave him again anyway. Boo-hoo.  He directs all his anger toward the guy she chose to run away with.<br /><br />What follows is a bunch of political propanganda concerning South Africa, landmines, corrupt politicians, (and when you see Zuwani's chief of security at the beginning, you know he's up to no good),murders, and Nicole Kidman's wig hanging in her face. First it's in her eyes, then out of her eyes, back in her eyes, behind her ear, in front of her ear.  Very distracting! Not to mention, she's in dire need of some chapstick.<br /><br />And what's with Sidney Pollack casting himself as Tobin's boss?  That was really uncalled for.<br /><br />NOT a good movie, no matter what anybody tells you. It's been done at least fifty times already.  Bobby Zoren from Law & Order - Criminal Intent could have solved this crime in less than 50 minutes, and he would have been a lot more interesting to watch doing it.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|With all the hype and beautiful people in this film, I thought it would be a good one.  NOT.  I hated this movie the entire time I watched it.  I thought it was the worse movie I have ever seen.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B000002U82|5.0|(...).    This is a great CD. This is the best selling album and has been on the charts 30 years later from 1973. Have you ever heard of Pink Floyd at all? Where you around in the 70's?
B00005JNQ8|2.0|The trailers for \\"The Interpreter\\" make it look like a taut suspenseful thriller, here we have a case of the trailer being better than the movie.<br /><br /> This Sydney Pollack film is about a United Nations interpreter (Nicole Kidman) who happens to over hear an assassination attempt on a African dictator (Earl Cameron). After Siliva Broome (Kidman) reports what she heard the secret service get involved (Sean Penn and Catherine Keener) and soon we are engaged in a guessing game of who could possible want to kill the African leader. So far pretty straight forward, right? What I dislike about the movie though is as it's setting up its characters we can tell who's going to do it. At first we think the movie is just trying to make us beleieve it's \\"so and so\\" but by the end of the picture we see that it actually is \\"so and so\\". The movie never should have done this. What this did for me was lower the suspense of the situation. The movie is actually leading us down the right path.<br /><br /> Another problem I have witht he movie is Nicole Kidman's performance. She has a murky past, and at first agent Keller (Penn) isn't sure he can trust her. She's keeping too many secrets. Now clearly the movie is doing this to create suspense and have us suspect Kidman but the way I interepreted her character was as someone who is non-cooperative and making things harder than they have to be. Kidman's character fears for her life and yet she will not fully cooperate with the police. What's wrong with her? She could die at any moment and refuses to tell the police what they need to know. After a while I lost all sympathy for her which is bad because now who does the viewer have to invest their emotions with. This cat and mouse game betwen Penn and Kidman, while interesting at first, becomes annoying.<br /><br /> Now I should point out my high opinion of the talent involved. I think with the exception of Naomi Watts, Kidman is the best actress working today. Sean Penn is without doubt the best actor of his generation. While he may not have the box-office appeal of a Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, I think he can dances circles around them. Performance after performance he demonstrates his wide range: \\"Mystic River\\", \\"21 Grams\\", and \\"Sweet and Lowdown\\". I also have a lot of respect for actor\director Sydney Pollack who has directed some films I've enjoyed very much. Given my opinion of the people involved you can imagine my disappointment.<br /><br /> Much has been made of the fact this movie was the first to be shot inside the UN. I think once we start paying more attention to the locations than the story we're in trouble. So what if this movie was shot inside the UN. I didn't think much was made of it.<br /><br /> I want to go back to Kidman's performance because I was bothered by it so. There's a moment in the film when Penn asks 'What do we know about this woman?' What's her religion? Does she vote? Is she a Democrat or a Republican? In short who is she? The question is asked but I never quite felt we get an answer. The movie spends too much time trying to hide her past and not enough time activately involving her in action.<br /><br /> But perhaps I'm being too hard on the film. I don't know. There were moments when I enjoyed Penn's performance and thought the film had some suspenseful moments, a bus scene comes to mind. Despite everything I even thought Kidman has one or two good scenes and Sydney Pollack does a nice job of holding everything together. He knows how to handle the material. But overall I just can't help but feel the movie doesn't quite live up to what could have been.<br /><br />** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br />p.s. I noticed a goof in the movie. Pay attention to Kidman's hair in the scene where Penn questions her about a photo and a scene in a bar. Notice how her hair shifts position.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Mildly disappointing film that has a wonderful cast that doesn't quite live up to what could have been. Has some goos scenes but left me wanting more.oos scenes but left me wanting more.
B00005JH7D|4.0|Marcus Miller's \\"M2\\" was a highly regarded album, and rightfully so, upon its release-- generally known as one of the true masters of the bass guitar, Miller shows off his skills on the instrument in this series of bass-driven songs-- Miller's schtick is to state the use the bass in a melody role, and why not?  No one ever expects a sax player or guitarist to be confined to playing certain lines after all.  The bass is mixed way in front, and is the primary solo voice on most pieces, but to me what makes Marcus so special as a bassist is his ability to seemlessly step back when soemone else solos and play in a more standard bassline role.  Musically speaking, the album is hard driven electric jazz-- I hesitate to title it either fusion or smooth jazz, it is most clearly influenced by Miles' records with Marcus in the late '80s. <br /> <br />The song selection features a good number of covers on this record, incuding jazz masters Coltrane (\\"Lonnie's Lament\\"), Mingus (\\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\") and Billy Cobham (\\"Red Baron\\") and new wave rock legends Talking Heads (\\"Burning Down the House\\").  Remarkably, its the pieces that Miller pulls way out of their original idiom, namely the Trane and the Mingus song, that succeed best-- \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" gets a really deep r&b arrangement that so stunningly reinterprets the song as to bury the original and \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" is one of those songs for bassist, they all eventually pursue it.  \\"Burning Down the House\\" really fails miserably in my book, it just sounds kind of goofy. <br /> <br />The remainder of the album is largely bass-driven instruments, some succeed better than others (opener \\"Power\\", \\"Nikki's Groove\\") and a couple great r&b vocal tunes (\\"Boomerang\\", with just some monster bass playing, \\"Your Amazing Grace\\")-- if there's a complaint, its that the album is really quite long and gets a little repetitive now and again, but there's so much good material on the record that its easy to overlook this.  I'd recommend \\"The Sun Don't Lie\\" over this one, but its definitely a great record.
B00005JLU1|5.0|I love this movie so much and I own it on VHS. CB is a real funny movie, it has good actors in it, and the music is great, too!  <br />Finally the studios opened their eyes and realized that the public wants CRY BABY ON DVD! Now, not only there's going to be a DVD of CB, but it will also be the Director's Cut with 7 minutes extra, and I'm sure they won't be boring. The movie will be shown in 1.85:1 WIDESCREEN, which is awesome and we can now enjoy better this great film!
B00005NGAG|5.0|Two young women, one exceptionally beautiful, are involved with highly abusive men. They seem unable to extract themselves from these indiviual violent relationships until events pull them apart. In spite of the violence, this is actually a darkly humorous movie, laugh out loud, and well worth seeing. There are no decent men in this picture, all are twisted or corrupt and violent. That is too bad. A sense of balance here would have been better.The acting is very good and the background of Glasgow is a pleasant change. There is a Thelma and Louise quality to it without the attributes of Brad Pitt. That said, this is the better film.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I like Bill Murray and I was waiting for something to happen......anything to happen. The characters were uninteresting and yet we were supposed to feel sympathy for these two misfits???? You're in Tokyo for about a week and can't find anything interesting to do but sulk and complain and wallow in self-pity? You've got to be kidding. Total waste of time.
0143034901|3.0|There were so many things about this book that I enjoyed -- the translation, for starters, which I thought was wonderful -- but while I enjoyed it overall, I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone I know, and therefore I can only give it 3 stars instead of 4.  (Never 5.)  I enjoyed the novel, despite its predictability and lack of suspense.  Fermin was a delightful character, I thought, and I enjoyed the idea of the endless cemetery/repository of books.  A good \\"beach read,\\" I've heard it called, and maybe that's the best description for it.

0060958324|4.0|One of my favorite books is \\"Catch-22.\\"  When you read Heller's book today, it's lost none of its impact - the message is timeless.  On the other end of the spectrum is \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" which reads like a hippie farse now, its message seeming entirely dated.  \\"Zen\\" falls somewhere in between, but closer to the positive end of the scale.    The book tells the story of a middle-aged college professor on a motorcycle trip, trying to re-connect with his son, a task made necessary and more difficult by the fact that our protagonist lost his mind in the recent past obsessing about a concept he refers to as \\"quality.\\"    The story follows our hero's attempts to pull the value out of the concept of quality while leaving behind the pieces of it that literally drove him out of his mind.  Many of the lessons that come out along the way are as relevant and valuable today as they were the day the book was first published.  That said, the book still feels a bit dated in a way that a true classic never should.    Recommended if you're curious what the fuss is about.
0060934913|5.0|For all those wannabe chefs, cooks, restaurateurs, or anyone involved or wanting to be involved in the restaurant business, please read this book. Anthony Bourdain takes you through a no nonsense tour of 27 years of life experience in the restaurant underworld. In his very peculiar style he depicts in detail the cruel reality of life in a professional kitchen, and the love for food that keeps him going in this very difficult career. This book is an eye-opener, a peek -through the hole - experience, a not to be missed read by anyone ever involved seriously with food. I personally loved it, but some may not. You would have to have the food \\"thing\\" in your veins to love this one.

Still, I think the band has done a great job and if you are a fan....you'll love it. <br />
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|This sequel is a fast-paced, dark oops-another-conspiracy movie, with superb acting by Matt Damon and Joan Allen. Nice chase scenes, nice locales...but totally ludicrous in the long run once the viewer starts realizing that Jason Bourne must be able to get into and out of any room or house or office or town he chooses, no matter what the security is.  <br /> <br />Sorry, but in my opinion this is a sequel in which the producers are more intent on locales and action rather than verisimilitude of the plot and character development.
B00008YJH5|5.0|As much as the Pixies were great songwriters and innovators, they will be remembered at least as much for their influence on future genres like grunge. Amidst the excess of glam and hair metal, the Pixies helped bring music back to its basics. There are no long technical guitar solos, no helium vocals, no makeup, costumes or gimmicks. The Pixies's music had a primal intensity that was equally weird and harsh as it was catchy and powerful. The influence and lasting power of Surfer Rosa and later, Doolittle, is a testament to the power of strong songwriting.  <br /> <br />The songs here zip by fast, many under 2 minutes. So it takes repeated listens to grab the subtle nuances that make this album so enjoyable. This music isn't too layered or complex, but it has true depth.  <br /> <br />The opening four songs, Bone Machine, Break My Body, Something Against You, and Broken Face let you know what you're in for. The harsh music, melodies that make more sense with repeat listens, latin tinges, disturbing lyrical imagery, and vocal maneurisms are all prevalent.  <br /> <br />Tracks 5-7 are the core of the album in my opinion. The popular Kim Deal penned Gigantic is catchy, upbeat and somewhat anthemic hiding the dark undercurrent of the lyrics. The quiet verse, heavy chorus structure was a fixture of Nirvana's songwriting. River Euphrates is one of the more catchy songs here. It reminds me of Wave of Mutilation from Doolittle. The chorus is very catchy but not in the traditional way. Where is My Mind? is the pinnacle of this album. It's beautiful, melodic, catchy and haunting. A classic by any defintion. <br /> <br />Cactus has a chugging guitar riff and drum work with Black's strained singing. Really catchy. Tony's Theme is a silly song about a superhero named Tony. Oh My Golly! is chock full of abrasive guitars and Frank Black's bilingual hysterics. Vamos is similar with crazy guitar effects and lyrics. At four minutes it's the longest song here, but it doesn't get boring. I'm Amazed has the band going off their hinges even more than usual. The closer Brick is Red has some interesting instrumental sections with bluesy distorted soloing and acoustic guitars juxtaposed. The vocals kick in eventually to round out this beautiful song and album.  <br /> <br />Surfer Rosa a monumental record for any genre. Plus, the Pixies's next album Doolittle is also amazing. Buy them.

It stars Stephen Chow (who was in Shaolin Soccer) and it has a great cast!!!!! It has choppy (but amusing) s/fx, and the humor and action is the TOPS. But Storyline?? I really can't review that cuz I really didn't find it that amusing. But this was a great show.<br /><br />P.S. As cses44 said, Why is it rated R? I don't get that. But overall, It was a great movie.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is a Certified Classic. It's real music, real R&B mixed with a hint of Pop. The lyrics are deep, their not poppish, she has a mature nature on this album. Lets not even get on her vocals. Vocally people like Mariah Carey and Beyonce get all the recognition as the best vocalist but Christina Aguilera is most def. up there with them. She has Lil' Kim, Redman and ALICIA KEYS! on the album, it sold 12 million world wide. I'm a big Britney Spears fan and I love her latest album but yo' if u wanna hear some REAL REAL TRUE TO THE HEART, SOMETHING TO GET YO' MIND RIGHT music, pick up Stripped.
B00028HBKM|5.0|JC is called the Prince of Peace but I can safely say that he was one tough hombre! I would of passed this veil of tears within the 1st five minutes. Altogether not a story for the weak of heart or stomach. Mr. Gibson is to be commended for a great and ballsy movie.
0920668372|1.0|As others have said, it is a very unhealthy way to portray unconditional love. The little song is cute, for a small child...but sorry, if my mom drove across town in the night and snuck in my window to rock me...I would have her committed! The end where the grown man then holds his sick mom...touching, but depressing for a child to think about. <br /> There are great books out there for children...this is not one of them.
B00002E23E|3.0|Yep, I was very dissapoint when I noticed that only 40% of the film is a footage, I would give this 5 stars if it a full lenght concert film. <br /> <br />The Bad Part: <br />1.The first part of the film that show some movie clips of the band members is quite interesting but it went tooooo long. <br /> <br />2.You will see clip that show the band members riding a horses instead of play their instruments while the concert is going on. <br /> <br />3.Dazed and Confused, I have no complain about the song, it's great!!! espectially the violin part but then........during some interesting effect you'll see Jimmy climbing up a mountain and next time you see the band is when Jimmy DONE his violin bowing!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />4.Moby Dick, You'll see Bonzo work in his farm more often than playing drums. <br /> <br />5.Heartbreaker, I'm not sure if they want us to see the band playing or watching news about the money stolen. <br /> <br />6.The band themself sometimes look lackluster. <br /> <br />The Good Part: <br />1.The footage of many songs is very good. <br /> <br />2.You'll see clip of JPJ during his solo on No Quater and it's interesting. <br /> <br />3.The magician clip during violin part in Dazed and Confued is totally high art!!!. <br /> <br />4.Stairway To Heaven is cool!! but not as great as the one from Earl's Court that includeed in \\"Led Zeppelin\\" dvd <br /> <br />5.Full lenght of Whole Lotta Love!!! <br /> <br />If you're a casual fan you should buy \\"Led Zeppelin\\" instead of this one.But some song here like The Song Remain The Same,The Rain Song, and Heartbreaker that the band play very often on the stage during their career sadly not include in their full length on \\"Led Zeppelin\\" dvd.
020530902X|5.0|Here is a manual of style that makes sense, is short, and to the point.  All business persons and college students should have a copy of Strunk & White.  ....and don't just use it as a reference; read it from front to back.  That would probably take about 1 hour.  You will gain more common sense grammatical knowledge from this book than a year of English classes.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Don't throw away Chicago, but Strunk and White is light, easy to read, and just plain makes sense!
0060763280|5.0|I read the book and also listened to the cd's in my car. Talk about breakthroughs. The book flows very well and by the time you get not even half-way through you'll have your lightbulb moment. Take advantage of the great gift that Eker gives the \\"Millionaire Mind Intensive\\" Seminar. Without a doubt I would have paid full price for the seminar.
1400032717|2.0|In chapter 17 on page 12 Christopher says the universe will end suddenly in a BIG CRUNCH, which is when gravity pulls all the stars together again. But the universe could also end slowly if all the stars move apart for ever and ever and the universe gets colder and colder and this is called the BIG FREEZE. Christopher reads lots of books about physics, so he knows this. But Mr. Haddon doesn't. So I think Mr. Haddon wrote this part.    And in chapter 19, the rule for working out prime numbers has mistakes, because if you take away all the multiples of 2, then of 3, then of 4, 5, 6, 7... you can't take away the multiples of 4 because they are multiples of 2, so they are gone already. And multiples of 6 are also gone, because you already took away the multiples of 3. Christopher wouldn't have made this mistake, so I think Mr. Haddon wrote this part, too.    In chapter 179 Christopher works out the best thing to do is to go live with mother. So Mr. Haddon shows us how people with SPECIAL NEEDS work out difficult problems, and this is what I wanted to know, because a lot of the book has difficult problems which Christopher solves, and this is very interesting.    But in chapter 101, Christopher explains how the Monty Hall Problem works. Except it doesn't sound like Christopher because it has words like INTUITION and POSSIBLE OUTCOMES and Christopher always explains difficult words like SINGULARITY and NEGLIGIBLE and RED HERRING, which is a clue which makes you come to a wrong conclusion, but he doesn't explain those other words.    So I don't think Christopher wrote the Monty Hall part, and I don't think Mr. Haddon wrote it either, because Mr. Haddon makes mistakes and this part hasn't got mistakes. So I think somebody else wrote this part and Mr. Haddon copied it into the book. And Mr. Haddon doesn't really know how a savant with SPECIAL NEEDS works out difficult problems and this makes me sad and I didn't read any more problems because they are a RED HERRING, and thatmakes these parts of the book a lie.    In the letters part, Christopher's mother spells words wrong. I think Mr. Haddon wants to show us she hasn't got a good education. But on page 135, Christopher's mother spells \\"really\\" and \\"lonely\\" each right once and wrong twice (\\"realy, lonley\\"). People that haven't a good education don't do that. They spell the same word wrong the same way, especially in consecutive sentences. Mr. Haddon is being CONDESCENDING, which is what intelligent people do when they try to be like people that are not so intelligent. But Mr. Haddon doesn't really know what that is like, so that makes this part of the book a lie, too.    Christopher's mother also explains big words like ANAESTHETIC (which she spells \\"anathsetic\\") just like Christopher does, so I think Mr. Haddon only has two character voices and he writes the whole book with these two. Also, on page 11 the policeman says \\"don't make me lose my rag\\", which Christopher doesn't understand, and on page 109 his father says the same thing and on page 136 his mother also says the same thing.    So I don't think Mr. Haddon has a lot of IMAGINATION, which is what you need if you want to pretend to be somebody else, like Christopher, so maybe even Christopher is a lie and that makes me groan and hold my hands over my ears push my head against the floor and makes me want to be sick.
0141439475|5.0|I love this book, and I love everything Frankenstein, even the cheesy movies.  But this book is where it all started, and I think it is one of the most profound examinations of the relationship between God and man I've ever read.<br /><br />The creation, the \\"Monster,\\" represents humankind.  The creation is constantly questioning why he was created, especially created with such deformities and faults.  Haven't we all felt that way?  Anyone who has ever cursed God (\\"Why did you create me this way?  Why did you make life so hard?\\") would related to the creation.  Eventually, the creation meets his creator, and demands to have what the creator has; here, a wife.  But doesn't that represent our wish as people to overcome our hardships and have what our creator has?  We humans yearn to be so much more than human!<br /><br />Dr. Frankenstein represents God, but unlike God, has (in the view of his creation) neglected his responsibility to his creation.  He created the creation just because he could, then couldn't follow through.  The Doctor is, afterall, only a man and not up the challenge of being a creator.<br /><br />In what ways do I feel like the creation, let down by a creator that I think has forgotten me?  What do I think God's responsibility is to his creation?  Is that realistic?  Stuff to meditate on sometimes.
B000003S1A|5.0|Discipline is a departure from the shattering Avant-Jazz-Metal-Classical amalgam that typified King Crimson's approach in the 70's. This was arguably the best music made in the 80's.  On Discipline, King Crimson revealed the potential of 80's rock before it was co-opted by the music video movement and degenerated into a parade of talentless one-hit wonders. Discipline is flawless from start to finish.  The musicianship is a wide-ranging marvel of technique and control. Elephant Talk and Thela Hun Ginjeet are sinewy and propulsive examples of ultra-sophisticated funk.  Matte Kudasai, Frame By Frame, and The Sheltering Sky are atmospheric and dynamic. Indiscipline conjures King Crimson's legendary power and places it in an ultra-modern context.  Bruford's electronic drum flurries, combined with Fripp's raging soundscapes and Belew's twisted vocals and guitar work, make this the highlight of the CD. An enduring and classic work.
B00005JNQQ|5.0|I have seen Robots in the theater 5 times with my 3 1/2 year old son and he still begs for more.  He loves it and sits through the entire movie without moving (even the 5th time). This movie should be reviewed through the eyes of a child.  This is not intended to entertain adults on an adult level.  I have watched my son repeat this movie word for word, action for action, and song for song. It has good music, funny actions, and it is overall entertaining for myself as well.
B0007P3582|1.0|actually this is not a kinda music to spend ur money. normally the fire within an artist will gradually tend to loss as he gains name ,fame and money but in 50's case its too early .his new album is not in anyway like his previous album \\"get rich...\\" you might have heared the chart leading singles such as 'disco inferno' 'and candy shop' just dont decide after hearing that because those two were the only good songs of the album that leaves us only 2 outta 20 even including that gun shot intro so that was the real reason behind givin our 50 a single star. regarding the production its as usual very weak since dr.dre is the producer (y dont they changr him ) and reg the feat its nuttin new 'cause  in eminems album 50 will do some feat work and vise verza.overall this album aint worth ur money. by the way i simply can't tollerate that 'piggy bank ' track man oh man.

B0007XT87G|5.0|THE BAND: Steve Wilson (vocals, guitar, creator, mastermind and main song writer behind PT), Richard Barbieri (keyboards and sound effects), Colin Edwin (bass), Gavin Harrison (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: 10 songs running at approximately 70 minutes. Liner notes include lyrics, assorted obscure pictures and thank you's. Video: \\"Behind The Scenes Video Montage\\" (Approx 7-8 minutes). There is an extended version of \\"Deadwing\\" with a limited edition 72-page booklet containing mostly pictures that you can buy at PT's concerts or on their website (if still available). 2005 - Lava Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Dead Wing\\" is a great album, but on first listen I could not put it on the same lofty perch as \\"In Absentia\\" or \\"Lightbulb Sun\\". With that being said, this album has grown on me over many months and it's now on the same level. It also helped seeing The Tree live (Arizona Beach Club, 10/25/05) and the songs from \\"Deadwing\\" rocked (especially \\"Halo\\", \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" with an incredible jam in the middle, and the stunning concert starter \\"Open Car\\"). Porcupine Tree is a unique pleasure to listen to. Often complex and varied, and rarely played on the radio waves. Maybe that's why so much of PT's catalog is still fresh - the songs are never overplayed. The band members are all master craftsmen. Steve Wilson (guitars & vocals) is the mastermind behind the band... and his genius once again shines on \\"Dead Wing\\". The new \\"Dead Wing\\" picks up for the most part where \\"In Absentia\\" (2002) left off... hard to define... covering many a rock genre - pop, rock, hard rock, electronic, soft rock ballads, 70's psychadelic rock, etc. I believe \\"Dead Wing\\" falls more in the 'rock' music category; more so than some of their more progressive material in years past. Wonderful vocals telling cusious stories. Brilliant guitars. Complex drumming and hi-hat work; no tom-tom left unused. Wonderful synth sound effects and piano. Stellar sound production as always, with crisp highs and deep lows. There are so many lush tones and layers upon layers of sounds - I honestly feel you'll get the best listen with high quality headphones. Porcupine Tree is easily the best band to (practically) never hit the radio. The 12 minute \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" starts out slow with the rest of the band joining the song as it builds... this is my 1st favorite song on \\"Dead Wing\\". Others include \\"Shallow\\" and \\"Halo\\" - hard rockers; with the mellow \\"Lazarus\\" tucked nicely between the two. Here's to hoping the next PT album doesn't take as long as this one to be released. Great disc (5 stars).ighs and deep lows.

B0007XT87G|5.0|\\"Deadwing\\" is the new masterpiece by Steven Wilson and the rest of his band Porcupine Tree - and I do not use the word \\"masterpiece\\" lightly.  Take a little Led Zepplin, a dash of Rush, a pinch of Opeth, a teaspoon of King Crimson, and a healthy dose of Yes, and you've got the bare bones mixture of Porcupine Tree's new release. <br /> <br />The production (self produced by Steven Wilson) is flawless - the CD is crystal clear, with each and every track polished to perfection.  The CD begins with the title track \\"Deadwing\\" - a pulsing keyboard line that transforms into a rush of guitar, bass, and drumming from complete masters of thier instruments.  You want complicated rhythm changes - check.  Articulate drum work - check.  Pumping progressive basslines - check.  Strong, imaganitive vocals - check.  It's all here, and the title track is just the beginning. <br /> <br />Other major highlights on this CD are \\"Shallow\\" (PT's self-proclaimed \\"big dumb rock song) - Tool fans should love this one.  Next is \\"Lazarus\\", a melodic pop ballad led by the talented keyboardist Richard Barbieri.  The piano line from this song will get stuck in your head, and the vocals are just enchanting.  \\"Halo\\" is back to an upbeat sound with an incredible bassline by Colin Edwin, riffy guitars, and more entrancing vocals.  Next up is my personal favorite on the entire CD - the 12-minute epic \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" - it starts simple, quiet, and builds into an incredible section in the middle with furious guitar riffing and incredible drum work by Gavin Harrison.  And just when you think the song can't go any further, it jumps into a beautiful acoustic passage by Mikael kerfeldt of Opeth.  \\"Mellotron Scratch\\", \\"Open Car\\", \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\", and \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" close out the CD with even more incredible instrumental and voice work. <br /> <br />There is also a hidden track on the CD called \\"Shesmovedon\\" that's an updated version of a previously released song (available years ago, only in Europe originally).  All background vocals on this CD are also done by Mikael kerfeldt of Opeth, and his vocals mix perfectly with Steven Wilson's.  Adrian Belew from King Crimson is also a guest guitarist on one of the songs on \\"Deadwing\\".   <br /> <br />This is a MUST-HAVE CD for anyone who wants something fresh, is tired of what's currently being played on American radio, and is ready to find something new and enjoyable with each listen of the CD.  Again, it's a masterpiece.  This is a CD that will not leave my player for years to come.  You won't have to spread the word - the music speaks for itself.  You want to impress your ears and your friends ears with new music? - buy \\"Deawing\\".  Every track is simply amazing.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />(Written by \\"the kid\\" who went all the way to Amsterdam from Dallas, TX to see Porcupine Tree in 2005)
B000067J1H|5.0|anyways maybe it's just me but this movie really got into my head. tyler durden's ideas and beliefs really make me question society and the lives of people around me. when fight club first came out me and my friends would be debating whether or not to skip the rest of the day after lunch. we would throw on that song \\"this is your life\\" this is your life and it's never going to get any beter than this. that song still sends shivers up my spine every time i hear it. and usually i end up doing hard drugs and in the passenger side of the car driving down the interstate to somewhere far away in the middle of the night. i almost forgot the girl in the movie marla is the most beautiful girl i've ever seen. but if you ever have one of those days where you want to say f**k it all, quit your job buy a bunch of cocaine and drive across the country with the girl your in love with or your best friends and your easily lured into opurtunities for mystery and an adventurous lifestyle like me watch this movie. or dont but it changes my life every time i watch it.
B00005RRG8|5.0|I love this Disney movie. It stars beautiful Maureen O'Hara, handsome Brian Keith and gives us a double helping of a very young Hayley Mills who plays twin sisters. The movie may be sugary sweet, but it is a real tribute to children, parenthood and love. Brian Keith (Mitch Evers) and Maureen O'Hara (Maggie McKendrick) divorced when their twin daughters were very young. Each took a child--one parent lives free and open California style (he), the other lives in stiff Bostonian style (she). Their children reflect their respective parents lifestyle. By a fluke the girls end up in the same summer camp, of course they (Sharon and Susan) meet; and that's when the fun begins. After initially disliking each other, they find they have more in common than their disturbing identical looks. Once connected, they decide that their parents must be reunited. However, neither is counting on papa Brian Keith having a gold-digging sweetheart (Joanna Barnes) and her greedy mother lurking about. Never mind, the girls soon take care of that. The Parent Trap has some hilarious moments. Some are laugh out loud funny. Just watch Leo G. Carroll as Reverend Dr. Mosby.<br /><br />The movie has a superb cast, Una Merkel is Verbena, Mitch's very wise and knowing housekeeper, Cathleen Nesbitt and Charles Ruggles are the wonderful and doting grandparents. John Mills (Haley's father) appears briefly as Mitch's golf caddy.  I was happy to see that the movie is now available on DVD.<br /><br />Vannie(~.~)<br /><br />Work & Family @ BellaOnline.com<br /><br />[...]
B00005JNBQ|5.0|i thought this was the funniest movies i'd seen in a long time just because everyone even the popular kids were so f**kin pathetic. and i guess maybe when i was in school i was kind of a bully and my friends and i would have made fun of everyone in this movie so i cant appreciate it for it's artistic values or whatever. but the random assualt afflicted on the geeks during school is the funniest s**t i've seen since i was in high school.

Can't wait for the next.
B00009MGR6|4.0|Three stars? Four stars? This one is tough to grade.  I ended up going with four stars because you can't give 3 1/2, and after performing a simple test on this album:  I haven't listened to it for a long time (a couple of years, I think), but looking at the track listing, I could actually remember at least part of all the songs without too much trouble.  Can't say that about too many records, can you?    This album isn't as uniformly strong as \\"Back In Black\\" or 1990's \\"The Razor's Edge\\", but the hit singles \\"Heatseeker\\" and \\"That's The Way I Wanna Rock n' Roll\\" are great, and several of the \\"lesser\\" songs are very good as well, with only a little bit of filler (\\"This Means War\\" and \\"Go Zone\\").    I always liked \\"Nick Of Time\\", with its descending wail of a chorus, and \\"Ruff Stuff\\" and \\"Some Sin For Nuthin'\\" are great as well. \\"Video\\" doesn't have the substance of \\"Highway To Hell\\" or \\"Back In Black\\", but it will be a fine addition to your AC/DC-catalogue once you've got those two, \\"The Razor's Edge\\", and \\"Let There Be Rock\\".
B0002V7ODI|4.0|When I sat down to watch this DVD with my boyfriend, I definitely was expecting it to be horrible. The beginning was a little slow, but that's because I'm not into stuff involving history. I liked the humor of the character Hellboy, and if you're going to get the movie, I definitely recomment the Director's Cut. Well worth the money.
0380733358|5.0|This is a superb book, and easily the best spy novel I have ever read.  Very well written. The character development is good, and the pace is excellent starting calmly and gradually escalating to a heart pounding conclusion.    A bonus is the fact that this novel is based on true events, and the reader gets a feel for war time England and how spies and counterspies really worked.    This one is a \\"don't miss.\\"
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is amazing. I'm not usually a fan of movies that take place \\"way back in the day\\" but this story is truely breathtaking. I have never seen a movie that draws me in in every which way. The ending was kind of obvious, even when I was reading the book, but every aspect of the movie was truely great. I recommend to the old, the young, and the in between.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I have only just bought this album so I can't say just yet how it compares to other Porcupine Tree albums.  However, after hearing it for the first time I can definitely say that this is an incredible album.  Everything Steve Wilson writes is incredible.  I was a little worried after hearing the song \\"Shallow\\" that the whole album would be like that...not that it's a bad song but it wasn't quite up to my expectations.  However, in context with the whole album I have no problem with it.   <br /> <br />All PT albums are different, I don't pick favorites because I like them all for different reasons.  Like another reviewer said, this is a fine place to start if you are just introducing yourself to PT.  If you are already a fan, I have no doubt that you will love this album.  I'm not really sure why that one reviewer had such a problem with it, I listened to it and just could not believe how brilliant Steve Wilson is.  I guess that's the risk when you continually change and evolve, each time you are going to alienate at least a few fans.  Don't let that scare you off though, this is a wonderful album.   <br /> <br />One of the best bands I have ever heard.  And the hidden song at the end really just made my day because that is one of my all time favorite porcupine tree songs.  It's re-recorded but I don't want to spoil the surprise...although if you keep reading these reviews you will find out.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was a Christina fan during her pop days. I recognized quickly the talent she possesed as a true vocalist.  I was pleased with the first album and was even more excited when I heard she was releasing another; one more adult, more mature...But I was very disappointed with her first single \\"Dirty,\\" that was not the Christina I was expecting. After seeing the video, it even took me a longer time to buy the CD, if it followed that trend, I was not going to spend money to follow. However, when I finally got the CD O MY GOSH, I couldnt have been more wrong. Stripped takes you on a journey through a relationship, it's so relative to everyday troubles of growing up, loving, loosing and learning. A must have for anyone's collection.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I liked the first movie and wanted to watch the 2nd and 3rd movies.  (MOVIES - not documentaries or special features.)  Sounds simple enough but TRY to figure out how to view them in sequence and you end up with more questions than answers.<br /><br />The Matrix titles and the order they should be viewed is very confusing.  If it's a trilogy, why is it listed as:  The Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix / Reloaded / Revolutions / Revisited / The Animatrix)?<br /><br />That's five (5) titles, not three(3)!.  How is your average-non-Matrix-geek going to figure out which of these 5 titles are the 3 movies?<br /><br />I've read 6 reviews so far and none lists the movies clearly such as \\"The first movie is called...The 2nd movie is....titled...\\"<br /><br />A desire to watch a movie should not be squashed with frustration as it happened to me here & now.

B00008PX8P|2.0|Since this DVD contains absolutely ZERO footage (no fooling,not even a second) from their seminal show at the summer 1974 Akron Rubber dome concert I must say I consider it a bit of a ripoff, and as I was only one of 18,000 people who attended this gig, I rather doubt that I'll be the only totally bummed Zep fan, what gives? On another note, one would be amiss not to mention the interminable length of this seemling unending concert disc. My god , this thing just seems to go on forever. Not 2 hours, not 3, but 5 1/2 ear-shattering hours. Even Woodstock at 3 days seemed to embrace more brevity than this lumbering behemoth. Frankly, I could not get through the damn thing in one sitting, but then I'm not the seasoned concert-goer I once was. Oh well. All things considered though, a stone classic, if you only buy one music DVD in your lifetime, do yourself a helluva big favor and make it this one. 'nuff said....
1573226521|5.0|I loved this book!  It's a very graphic and descriptive narrative of a backpacker's paradise.  If you love to travel - you'll probably love this book.  The way Garland wrote made me feel like I was right there in the main character's head.  It is MUCH better than the movie.
B00005JNQ8|1.0|Sean Penn comes off as a real doofus in this film.  Is he asleep throughout?  Kidman does a wonderful job as the interpreter, she is beautiful and believable.  We believe she is frightened, but Penn seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Keller.  Hello?  Somebody smack him awake, this beautiful woman's life's in danger!! <br /> <br />I was really disappointed in Sean Penn's performance.  He failed to pull out some real emotion and compelling character.  He's not even believable as the grieving widower. <br /> <br />Sadly, a forgettable film. Kidman's performance was wasted.  No action, slow pace, needed more suspense, a car chase, or something.  I've seen episodes of Fox's '24' that were more of a thrill!  The bus scene was THE highlight of the film.  The Interpreter is surely not in the class of \\"Three Days of the Condor\\", \\"Ronin\\", or even \\"Bourne Identity\\".
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Ok, I finally got around to watching Closer this weekend. Whoa, I felt like I had gone 10 rounds with Mike Tyson at the conclusion of this. I guess I don't understand how people can be so cruel and yet so forgiving of each other, especially after doing their best to hurt one another. Makes me sort of glad to be single, because if this is how love goes in this day and age, I'll stay home and watch cable.  <br />I didn't really like Julia's and Jude's characters, they seemed as if they were adrift in life, looking for the next best thing to come along.  <br />Clive's character, well, he did seem to know what he wanted and ultimately he did get it, but I can't imagine as to what cost.  <br />And honestly, if i had to choose between Clive and jude, I'm going with Clive, he had the vulnerable quality to him that makes him likeable despite his faults. <br />Natalie's character was the one I had the hardest time figuring out. Ultimately you find out that most everything about her was probably a lie, and yet I got the feeling what she sought was truth. <br />Ultimately I guess it boils down to the fact that love is not always pretty and it does indeed hurt, especially the ones you think you love the most. <br />
B0007Y4USW|4.0|When I first got this album, I was a little thrown off at how many uptempo tracks it had.  Mariah can easily pull them off, but I'm more into the slow Mariah.  I gave it a few more listens, and it grew on me. When Mariah does duets with rappers, a lot of people tend to write her off. She's not trying to cross over, or fit in. The songs on here with Twista & Snoop prove that.  Over her career, she has done songs with Jay Z, Nas, Snoop, Mobb Deep, Twista, Mystical, ODB *RIP* and others. What other female R&B singer can say they've worked with as many talented emcees as Mariah? Not Beyonce, not Mary J, not Ashanti, nobody can.  Mariah is the queen of r&b, and has the best voice [by far]. I was glad to see this album debuet at #1 on the charts. It shows the world she still had it in her, and as long as she's making music, she will stay on top. It just proves that Mariah cannot be touched.  The ballads on here, are as always, breathtaking.  And the dancy tracks are nice, none of them have Mariah's singing sounding forced.  Too bad the deluxe release I bought doesn't have a DVD, but the poster is a nice touch. <br /> <br />This is an album I'll be playing for years to come, Mariah has done it again...
B00079018K|5.0|The title of my review pretty much says it all for this album. Good dynamic, the songs are catchy, and the lyrics are very, well, interesting. You have to listen a couple times through to get it, but that's what makes this album so good. It takes some time to figure out, and I find it to be quite intriguing. I think this album stands out from others in the genre in that is doesn't have that \\"Killers-Franz Ferdinand-Strokes\\" sound. Those are all good bands, but Kasabian definitely stands out from the group. <br /> When I heard the first single, \\"Club Foot\\" I was expecting something a little harder, but this album is full of surprises and quite refreshing. I would recommend it to anyone looking for some new music.
B0001LQJQW|4.0|It's really interresting work. I love time travel and the Medieval history. It's funny to look at the movie and see a region of rawdon city in quebec. I live across Rawdon and my friend be casted for knight in both army. I love the movie for the realistic look of the brutal time of this Dark Age.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I had to read the play \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" for my Shakespeare English class.  I liked the play but was a little confused as to where all the characters and plots fit together.  So, to help my class better understand the play, my teacher had us watch \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" as we read.  As many people may or may not know this movie is a modernized version of the Shakespeare play \\"The Taming of the Shrew.\\"  Believe it or not the movie did help clarify the confusion I was having with the play.  This movie followed the general plot of the play very close, but also put a modern spin on it to make it more relatable to today's standards. I liked the movie and would have watched and enjoyed it even if I wasn't watching it for a class. I would recommend it to others to watch.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this video. Just as I expected, these guys are so out of touch with reality it is frightening. It is nice to see the mighty fall on their pompous little butts. That should be a lesson to anybody who thinks rock stars and rappers are anybody worth looking up too, the joke is on you.  It is time for metalica to quit before they make bigger fools of themselves, and a word for Lars, learn when to shut the !@#$ up !
6304698798|5.0|*This film exemplifies American film-making at its best. In flawless and fast-paced action, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly provides limited dialogue amongst its characters, as the acting is simply fantastic not only for its time but in the history of film. Eastwood is at his best.................the film encompasses and intriguing plot with suspense, action, revenge, and courage...not to mention the ending is fantastic...see it for yourself
B00000JLWW|5.0|I got this movie today! The last time I saw it was when I came to America from Japan. It was sad and good at the same time! I like every single part of it, especially when Rose and Jack were on the ship and Rose was \\"flying\\". It got sad when Jack died (sobbing). I describe Rose as bold, emotional, and stupid. Overall, I give this Award Winning Film 5 more stars!
0671027387|3.0|Rachel Sexton works for the NRO - an intelligence agency located just outside of DC.  Its Director is a vocal opponent to NASA because of its security leaks.  Her father is running for President against the incumbant and has hinged his entire platform on the concept of NASA overspending the taxpayers money.  She abhors her father and finds herself in the middle of a scientific discovery that will change the world and her father's ruthless campaign that will be toppled by the discovery.  Add meteorites and murderous Delta Forces, and you have Deception Point.<br /><br />Does this description sound convoluted and ridiculous?  That's pretty much how Dan Brown's novel reads.  It's mindless entertainment, and the plot is just not very good.  Often I found myself saying, \\"Ok, please get to the point.\\"  This novel is not the \\"fast paced thriller\\" some of the reviews advertise, but it is not all bad.  Do not pick it up expecting an award winner, but instead something to read on the beach.  Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code are much better despite being \\"beach reads\\" themselves.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I had really high expectations of the movie from the second I heard about it, so it wasn't as good as I thought. However, it was funny at some parts and very serious and almost tear-jerking if you put actually put yourself in the character's positions at other parts. As for the reviewer who said the actors need to clean up their language: What did you expect from a movie rated R?
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausica of the Valley of the Wind is Miyazaki's anti war epic.  Disney has released this film in a 2-disc set.  This set contains an interesting documentary on the birth of Studio Ghibli.  Unfortunately Disney didn't include an option to watch the documentary with its original language and subtitles.  I highly recommend this DVD to all animation fans.
B00005JMJG|5.0|There are so many ways to describe the charms of 'Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind' -- original, strange, bizarre, confusing, funny, New York City, frozen winter, tricks done by memories, Kate Winslet's hair, etc.  To me, it's simply a love story.   <br /> <br />Of course, as this is Charlie Kaufman-scripted love story, it's no ordinary love story, and in fact you are introduced to a medical service 'Lacuna Inc' that offers you a great chance to erase parts of your memories, to start your new life.  But still 'Eternal' remains a love story.  And the story goes like this. <br /> <br />[THE STORY] Joel (very strained Jim Carrey) decides to erase his memoires of Clementine (excellent Kate Winslet), after, it seems, he had a bitter argument with her.  He goes, like any embittered lover does, 'Fine, I'm going to forget everything about her.' <br /> <br />But we soon realize one true thing.  Once the erasing process starts, which goes from the newest memories to the older ones, Joel realizes that his decision was too hasty, for after all, not everything was bad as he thinks.  The older the memories become, the more precious they are, and Joel realises it, maybe too late. <br /> <br />There are many visual gimmicks (which are supported largely by Michel Gondry's well-crafted low-tech skills), and some sequences in which Jim Carrey can unleash his wild comic genius, 'Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind' is for the most part about the relations between a man and a woman.  You may call it romantic comedy, but it is also the first romantic comedy of which romance grows in someone's brain, or the spotless mind. <br /> <br />Altough top-notch cast including Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson are assembled (or probably they came to the filmmaking FOCUS studio very spontaneously), it is Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who really shine in this unusual film.  It is great to see Kate Winslet coming back from the devastating 'Holy Smoke' by which her careerwas almost killed (I'm talking about that scene). <br /> <br />It is confusing at times, but is also worth the trouble.  If you cannot follow some part, just forget it and keep on watching the love story between Joel and Clementine.  That's very intelligent and moving at the same time.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I will not recount the \\"gory\\" details of the series excellence only to say that if I could give this 50 stars I would. If you like guy films, you will love this mini-series. If you like drama, you will love this mini-series. It's excellently written, and excellently acted.
B0007TKH66|1.0|You know, I'm a major Star Trek Nut!! I am! I admit it. <br /> <br />I'm also a Scott Bakula fan. I've love Quantum Leap, and I tolerated most of Scott's movies. Even the bad ones were made enjoyable by his performance. <br /> <br />But his Captain Archer killed this series. Well, that, and the idiots that can't figure out established cannon. I mean, the sheer appearance of the Klingon shoutted alarms all over the place. But I could have handled it... except, he wasn't the CLASSIC Star Trek Klingon. DS9 establisheed that there was a reason why the older klingons were different.  <br /> <br />Worf: \\"We don't talk about it to outsiders!\\" (even though they redid Kang and other classic trek klingons in the full makeup in the earlier season! LOL! <br /> <br />But then they did a 7of9 trick with Jolene Baylock (or however you spell it), and sexed up the vulcan. The decontam scene was STUPID, and it's the main reason why I gave up the show. Here is a basic plastic woman, nearly naked, and a Bowflex dude rubbing this lotion all over themselves. (the science of it I didn't have a problem with it... it was the Sexiness I did.) I mean, did they REALLY need the eyecandy bit? C'mon!! <br /> <br />But then, as I continue this assassination of the show, they venture out to the Klingon homeworld... <br /> <br />Established cannon also showed that the first time they encountered the Klingons was in space... and it resulted in battle... and that started the war. WHICH wasn't resolved until the Khitomer conference fully 80 years before \\"TNG\\"... <br /> <br />Then the FERENGIs?? Oh COME ON!! <br /> <br />Then the canned ol' Temperal stuff? <br /> <br />Then the BORG??? Jezely Crow, isn't ANYTHING Sacred? <br /> <br />Oh wait, guess not. Here's Dr. Nunian Soong's predecesor! <br />And for the last show, they're bringing in Riker and Troi! Obviously another time travel stunt gone wrong! <br /> <br />Just rediculous! <br /> <br />And Paramont's always been a stickler about their prices onDVDs... $90 is far cheaper than their original $129.99 for the first season of TNG I remember seeing... bit it's STILL too damned expensive! I have been buying tv season shows for $24.99 - $45.99 (and nearly balked at that last one!) <br /> <br />No, I'm a fan, but I'm an honest one. This was garbage from the getigo. The stupid beagle should have been fed to the warp core a long time ago (and I'm a dog lover!)... I just remember way too much about the early show (Christopher PIKE... HELLO?) that established so much. <br /> <br />They call it SCI-FI for SCIENCE FICTION... not soap opera bull! <br /> <br />Count me outta this one! I stopped watching Voyager after they introduced 7of9... I don't need plastic women to interest me in scifi!
B000065U1N|2.0|This movie is in no way a accurate accounts of the US conflict in somalia, it over simplifies the the reason for the conflict and protrays the somalians as  \\"terrorists\\" and the UN peace keeping troops as scum. When looking at this movie from a action movie standpoint it's okay, but looking at it from any other angle and it's mere propaganda.    If you want action without accuracy or realism, then this movie is for you.
B00003CWTI|1.0|not unlike the current of an ocean forged of crocodile tears, I found myself intrigued by how such a monumental epic of sap and plot diversion could possibly end.  Even after three hours of self-conscious weirdness and dialogue, only effective to the most gullible of viewers, I still felt that something could be salvaged.  But how can you end a film full of hysterical sobbing of the obnoxious kind?  Well at the end of the film, as the viewers were bounced from plot to plot, each cut featured a big, fat sobbing face.  A film can only earn that kind of emotion with fine writing, a great performance, and well-conceived characters.  Trying to coerce intense reactions from audiences is a poor method of message delivery in my opinion.
B00000099Y|5.0|The thing they do better than any other band is allow both the lyrics AND the music tell the story.  It's very powerful and very deep and you need above a \\"stoner IQ\\" to truely appreciate it. <br /> <br />You won't find any teen angst songs about hating your mom and your dad or any songs on how you're sorry for treating your girlfriend wrong.  If that's your thing, go listen to good charlotte or blink 182 or one of the other bands that put out sugar coated simplistic lyrics these days.
0141439661|5.0|I read Sense and Sensibility for my English IV Course. This novel was written by Jane Austen. This book is for a romantic person, adult or young adult. If you are someone who is interested in 19th Century society and the roles of women, this story is for you. Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. The author is well known and the quality of literature is world class, because it is so well known.<br /><br /> Sense and Sensibility describes the adventures of two young ladies (Marianne and Elinor) falling in love. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and senses. Marianne is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who have no evidence of wholly encompassing emotions or are without them entirely. She ultimately marries her long standing admirer, Colonel Brandon. Also Elinor is the heroin of the story. The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is weird; she is always after her daughters minding their business. She is the opposite of Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice. She has inherited no fortune of her own but wants the best for her daughters and shares Marianne's romantic sensibilities. The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward and Marianne falls in love with Willoughby.<br /><br />The conflict of the ideas about marriage between parents and daughters is the main theme of this book. If the girls were not yet married, their mothers employed themselves in matching the younger women with eligible men.<br /><br /> I recommend Jane Austen's work to all readers who are fascinated with love.  This is an excellent book for those who enjoy 19th Century Literature. Even though I missed some details because of the language, I identified with one the girls in the story.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|This record sounds great!  It is raw and very nicely engineered.  The playing is excellent, particulary Steve Gadd and of course Eric Clapton.  Many of the negative reviews seemed to be personal jabs at Clapton rather than intelligent critiques.  I've been playing Robert Johnson for 20 years and I feel this is a very inspiring tribute.  Nice!!!
078681859X|5.0|I thought when i picked this up that it was going to be a lot like the Harry Potter series but I was wrong.  It's better!  It's a lot darker though.  I wouldn't recommend the book for under the age of 12 at least.  The plot (without any spoilers) involves a djinn captured by a magician's apprentice and forced to do his will to reek revenge on another magician for humiliating him.  It gives a good lesson on how vengence can do more harm than good, but overall, while the lesson does stand out, the characters are so riviting and the story is so well written it has no sense of preachiness.  Fun read!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have just have to say this is the BEST Mariah Carey cd by far.  I really stopped listening to Mariah around after Butterfly. So when it was announced that she had a new cd coming out, I went to the Listening Party on AOL and got hooked. I love every single song on this cd.  I find myself listening to it over and over again.  You go Mariah.  You have a hit on your hands.
B0000640VO|5.0|as i write the review for Amelie, i get a sense of joy running through my body..this movie is absolutely outsatanding. Audrey Tatou is so cute as the pixy faced Amelie, who is do gooder for society. She helps couples find love, the depressed to find happiness, the blind to enjoy lifes pleasures through imagination, touch, and smell, and the cruel to get revenge. But not in the way that Uma Thurman gets revenge in Kill Bill Volume 1+2, but in the way that making the villian suffer in an ungruesome but still funny way . Meanwhile, through all this do gooding, she puts her own life on hold. She gets much excitement elsewhere through skimming stones along water, dipping her hand in grain, having bad sexual experiences, tyhinking odd questions like 'how many people are having orgasms at that moment. That is until she meets Nino, that her world comes to a hault, and for the first time she puts herself first, finding out eventually that doing good, means getting good in return, and that her seemingly happy world becomes even more brighter. Amelie, like its lead actress, looks good, and does everything right!
B0007OCG4W|5.0|It's a rare thing in movies now a days to see actors acting their wits out ... This movie reminded me of the classic \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" (also directed by Mike Nichols) and I think it's an honorable comparison. Just four characters, with ordinary lives like a photographer, a dermatologist, a newspaper editor and a don't-know-what-to-do-with-my-life kind of beautiful girl who'll (practically) fall for a complete stranger, all running into each other by twists of fate and forming a powerful square where they cross each other, fall for each other, run into each other, avoid each other, love each other, despise each other ... show compassion that'll make a priest feel like a rookie ... and settle scores as mercilessly as a corporate lawyer on Wall street. All four actors are marvelous but look out for Clive Owen. Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are perfect for the parts they've played and they really put life into their characters but Clive Owen brings a force to his part that makes him stand way beyond all others. The movie brings out the complexities of something as simple as 'Love' but at the same time, portrays that maybe its not love, but lust that's driving everyone.   <br /> <br />Mike Nichols has done an excellent job directing this relationship rollercoaster but watch out for the rated language.  <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHM|4.0|What can i say Saw is a brilliant film, an like many brilliant films it is also low budget..now don't let that put you off, because it is extremely entertaining. Cary Elwes, one of the lead actors was quite irritating though, and the over the top gore could have maybe been grunged down, but saw overall proves a fantastic treat <br />
B0002ZEOBO|5.0|This is the most wonderful work by Michael Jackson, the japan version of this box set contains 5 bonus track songs: \\"heal the world\\" \\"blame it on the boogie\\" \\"human nature\\" \\"one more chance\\" & \\"another part of me\\"
1400032717|1.0|reading this book.  For years I have gone by the average ratings on books here on Amazon to pick my reading.  This was the first time that failed me.  I was bored to tears with this.  It is not \\"bitterly funny\\", \\"amazing\\", or \\"a classic\\".  I'll give it unique but that's about it.  It was like sitting down to read the book of Genesis for me.  Yes, I understand that's the whole point:  the mind of someone with Autism is so complicated we could never understand.  My point is just that:  I don't have it, I can't understand, I did not enjoy it.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Actually 10 stars or more. I just can't believe how these guys pull off album after album, the greatest music like ever to be made. <br />Arriving Somewhere But Not Here is a monster.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|The director of this film made a wise decision: make this retelling of the story of the Trojan war realistic for modern audiences. The original Illiad by Homer (on which this movie is based) is full of gods and goddesses playing with the human characters as if they were puppets. By cutting out all the gods and goddesses, we have a more clean to-the-point epic of ambition, power, love, and warfare. The characters are dirty, sweaty human beings and as fellow human beings we recognize the struggles they face. <br /> <br />Some of the great themes of literature are raised in this film. One of these is the nature of leadership. What a wonderful contrast in leadership we see between Achilles ( a beautiful killing machine), Agamemnon (a ego maniac constantly consolidating power), Ullyses (a wise manipulating survivor),  King Priam (a patrician who trusts the gods), and Hector (a loving family man of character who unfortunately must face the demi-god Achilles in mortal combat). <br /> <br />There is a price for editing out all the gods (Apollo, Athena,Juno, Neptune, and Aphrodite) in that the manipulations of the gods explain the motives of some of the characters. For example, when Paris selects Aphrodite as the most beautiful of the goddesses, his prize (or bribe) is that the most beautiful women in the world will love him upon first sight. Helen (herself a demi-god since she is the daughter of Zeus and Leda) is that woman and we are never convinced in the film that this woman would leave her husband for the young pretty boy, Paris. <br /> <br />We also don't understand the sacrifice Agamemnon made to the war. The gods would not give him winds for his fleet until he sacrificed his daughter, Iphegenia. This messy scene was never shown. <br /> <br />Also, the link between Ulysses and Achilles is never explained. Remember that it is the trickster Ulysses who finds the adolescent Achilles hidden in women's clothes because his mother knows he will die a warrior.  <br /> <br />The acting was very good. Peter O'Toole as King Priam was a standout. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana as the brothers Paris and Hector were superb. Saffron Burrows as Hector's suffering wife Andromache conveyed the personal and national crisis of Hector's death. <br /> <br />But what was the best scene in the film?  The scene where King Priam comes to Achilles tent in the enemy camp to beg for his son's mangled body so that it might be washed and given a burial. O'Toole plays the role perfectly of a patrician,noble old man who has lost his beloved son and must now beg the killer for the corpse. Pitt does a good job of showing a man who was consumed with his own anger and grief begin the process of healing by discovering compassion and empathy within himself.  <br /> <br />And what was the best line in the film?  As Hector leaves his family to go outside the city gates to face Achilles, his father King Priam, puts his hands on his son's shoulders and says: \\"No man has ever had a finer son that you have been to me.\\" These are the words every son wishes to hear his father say, unfortunately sometimes it takes crisis for us to open our hearts.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|What a simply beautiful film!  A visual feast for the eyes--costumes, sets, cinematography, and particularly the cast.  Emmy Rossum is a lovely child with a potentially wonderful voice who plays her part with wide-eyed innocence, which is as it should be.  Patrick Wilson as Raoul is sweet and charming.  However, Gerard Butler is the sexiest damnned ghost I've ever beheld!  Even with the mask off, his is the character that begs sympathy and understanding for all those who go through life looking \\"different\\" from people around them.  As far as the singing skills of the cast, I had a difficult time not comparing them to the original London stage production cast, particularly Sarah Brightman (her voice so rich, full, and clear) and Michael Crawford (strong, deep, and resonant)--just goes to prove there is little to improve on age and experience.  However, the actors in this lushly done film do a fine job with a long score and they as well as the production staff are to be commended for even attempting to make a movie of this beloved play.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|There are 3 things that make this soundtrack so unforgettable and such a must have.    1 ) Idina Menzel:  Her bombastic high belt is unbelievable.  It makes for showstoppers such as Defying Gravity, The Wizard and I, and No Good Deed.  This alone would make this CD a must have.  Idina's voice is beyond compare with any vocal of this year.  Amazing.    2 ) Kristin Chenoweth:  Her humor, unique tone, and ability to inject any sort of emotion into her vocal performance is outstanding.  She makes a song like Popular because of impeccable comedic timing, she makes a song like For Good happen out of sheer emotion.  Not to mention a soprano to rival any soprano of recent Broadway.    3 ) The Soundtrack tells the story.  Through emotion of the actors, through the excellent writing of Schwartz, and through the structure of the musical using the songs to progress the plot one can get a good general idea of the plot from this soundtrack alone.  Yet, a good idea is all you'll get because the book of wicked is a complex and very well written one.    All in all, A+ soundtrack.  Amazing, a phenomenon and classic in our own time.
B000088E6D|5.0|Finally! Maybe with artists such as Michael and Josh Groban modern music is finally going to start appreciating real musicians again. The smooth voice of Michael Buble reflects the masters of the past generations. One can only hope that the youth of today hear this music and appreciate the sounds of music.

B000002GQE|5.0|You people miss the meaning of the Moody's albums from Days of Future Passed thru Seventh Sojourn. All of those albums were head music. Head music without drugs. Their lyrics, Justin's, John's, Mike's, Ray's, and Graeme's made you think. It's why in those days they were granted, by we Young Americans, the status of knowing all of the answers. It was because of what they asked. They asked the questions like no one had done before. I'm 55 years old and ever since \\"Go Now\\", they have been my favorite group/band. With Days, they expanded the rock music horizon. With every album since, the have expanded that horizon and kept up with the musical times. Justin's and John's lyrics are some of the most beautiful and memorial in rock history. <br /> <br />From Tuesday Afternoon, Nights In White Satin, The Story In Your Eyes, The Voice, I Know You're Out There Somewhere to December's A Winter's Tale.  <br /> <br />And yes, if your interested, I have all of their CD's and vinyl. <br />And I have compiled a list of all of their lyrics, by album, each in it's own folder. <br /> <br />I listen to the Moody Blues most of the time. My favorite album is still \\"Days\\" - it's the most relaxing piece of music I've heard. <br /> <br />Yes, there are some on each album I don't really care for, but it doesn't stop me from listening.

B0007XT87G|5.0|As soon as I popped the CD into the player, I was blown away. I don't care what Porcupine Tree's picky picky fans have to say about the changes in the band's sound. PT haven't gone Metalhead, even though they tend to lean towards the constant demands of the fans lately. There are 3 heavy tracks, but it doesn't change anything. If there's any reason for PT to be the way they are now, it's because of the fans. Sorry, but it's true! Personally,  I find PT to be getting better with age. They haven't dropped their signature sound, as found on the \\"Lightbulb\\" or \\"Stupid Dream\\" albums.<br /><br />As I've no favorite tracks on \\"DeadWing\\", there are 2 songs which appealed to me right away upon my first listen to the album (aired on a Metal radio station in the USA). These are the 2 tracks: \\"Lazarus\\" and \\"Arriving Somewhere, but not here\\".<br /><br />In \\"Lazarus\\", I love Steve's soft voice, his stunning lyrics and the soft, flowing piano. Of course, the song couldn't be complete without the mellotron. It's definitely one of their best songs ever recorded!<br /><br />Why I chose \\"Arriving...\\" as my 2nd choice, I love it for all the same reasons. It sounds mysterious, dreamy and like I either just stepped into or out of a dream. The Mellotron & organ arrangements are incredible.<br /><br />Each track on the album prepares the listener for the next. That's what I admire about Steven's musical genius. He never bores his fans/newbie listeners. The only disappointment, regarding this album is the lack of songs. Why only 9 songs + the hidden track \\"Shesmovedon\\"? Fortunately, the songs are long enough, but I get into the music and find myself expecting more at the end. The CD is 69 minutes long, packing in over an hour of fantastic earcandy.<br /><br />Tracklist:<br />01- DeadWing<br />02- Shallow<br />03- Lazarus<br />04- Halo<br />05- Arriving Somewhere, but not here<br />06- Mellotron Scratch<br />07- Open Car<br />08- Start of Something Beautiful<br />09- Glass Arm Shattering<br />10- Shesmovedon (Hidden Track)<br /><br />Bonus Feature (Enhanced Part):<br />The Enhanced part of the CD is a CD-ROM, featuring a short video clip in .MOV format. This video features the \\"Making of the album\\". We see some quiet, busy \\"behind the scenes\\" footage in Steven's recording studio, bringing us closer to him and his music. It's a nifty little video and I'm sure you'll love it! \\"Shesmovedon\\" is re-visited with a more accoustic feel to it. One of my fave PT tracks!<br /><br />Regarding the packaging...the CD is housed in a jewelcase, which will crack or break if mishandled. I was hoping the CD would be in a digipack, as most digipacks have their own character. But like all PT's stuff, a digipack version could very well venture out of the woodwork all repackaged and buff.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />There are absolutely NO photos of the band, and there are NO lyrics in the booklet. Instead, there are a bunch of passages and strange, \\"Steven-esque\\" images and collages. It's all very artistic & different from their other lyrics/liner notes booklets.<br /><br />In 1999, I discovered PT, upon listening to their \\"Stupid Dream\\" album in a music store. Since then, I've been hooked on their music, and have followed them until now. Sadly, in lots of cities & locations, PT seem to be one of the most underrated, unknown bands. I'm glad they're getting more promotion and attention...yet they should NOT go too commercial, for it will wreck them. For me, progressive rock is one of my 2 favorite genres of music. PT's material just keeps getting better. And this time around, PT have created a more complex album than with \\"In Absentia\\". Of course, they've retainedf their signature sound we've all come to know them from. \\"DeadWing\\" is an \\"experimental\\" album, as was with \\"Blackfield\\". It's musical, melodical and pleasing to the ears. All the songs are unique and leave me wanting more. Fortunately, they'll be coming to Montreal in May, so it should be interesting to see what the newtracks from the setlist will sound like live.<br /><br />Like I said at the beginning of this review, there are heavy songs, but the CD is NOT a \\"Metal\\" album. The heavier songs (Deadwing, Shallow and Halo) are just as great as their earlier stuff, because of the remnants of the earlier atmosphere of PT.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, I don't care what anyone says about the \\"heavy\\" stuff, because it's just music...not a way of life.<br />The album is perfect just the way it is, and my expectations were satisfied. Once again, PT has closed their album with a dramatic, slow & dark song (Glass Arm Shattering).<br /><br />Like I said earlier, I'll be seeing PT live on May 16th in Montreal. I can't wait to see & hear these new songs, live & in person. I've seen them twice in Montreal for their \\"In Absentia\\" Tour. PT are a band unlike any other, and I support Steven & his crew all the way.<br /><br />Right now, I'm quietly & privately anticipating what their concert will be like, considering the album is flawless. Ironically, this album was released quite soon after the \\"In Absentia\\" CD, but SW's magic has flowed just the same. It takes a long time to create a masterpiece, and sometimes it's better for an artist to wait longer between releases. Once again, everything worked out great.<br /><br />If you're into PT and Progressive Rock Music, this CD is definitely for you!but the CD is NOT a \\"Metal\\" album.

B0007OCG56|4.0|James L. Brooks' latest movie, Spanglish, seemed to fly right under the critical and commercial radar despite the presence of Adam Sandler. Perhaps it was the misleading trailers that pegged the movie as some kind of goofy Sandler comedy. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the story is told by a young Mexican girl named Christina about her mother, Flor and their misadventures in America.<br /><br />Those expecting Spanglish to be a typical Sandler movie will be disappointed. Brooks prolongs his first on-screen appearance for as long as possible and when it does happen it is in a subtle, understated way with no fanfare. For the first half of the movie, Sandler plays a supporting role, allowing the other actors room to do their thing and then, in the last half, he comes to the foreground as the drama between him and Leoni's character comes to a boil. As brilliant as he was in Punch-Drunk Love, Sandler is even better in Spanglish, dropping most of his usual schtick by playing a nice, normal guy who loves his family. He hits all the right comedic beats but in a quiet, restrained way and ably handles the serious moments too.<br /><br />Ultimately, Brooks' films are about tolerance and optimism in a time when our society is so cynical and jaded. His movies happen in spite of the world outside. Very few mainstream American films deal with class differences and Spanglish tackles it head on as Flor and her daughter's Mexican heritage clash with the Clasky's upscale world.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director James L. Brooks and the film's editors, Richard Marks and Tia Nolan. He speaks eloquently about Spanglish with the editors chiming in occasionally.<br /><br />There are 12 additional scenes, totaling 30 minutes, with optional commentary by Brooks and his editors. We see some of the footage of Flor and Christina in Mexico and a funny scene that gives Georgie more screen-time and pays off an earlier gag where Evelyn was teaching him jazz songs. With most cut footage it is readily apparent why they were cut but most of this footage is excellent and could have been kept in if it hadn't extended an already fairly long movie.<br /><br />\\"HBO First Look: The Making of Spanglish\\" is a standard press kit featurette with soundbites from Brooks and the cast mixed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />\\"Casting Sessions\\" features footage of some of the supporting cast auditioning for the movie with optional commentary by Brooks. It becomes immediately obvious that these actors were perfect for their roles and that Brooks is a genius at casting his movies.<br /><br />\\"How to Make the World's Greatest Sandwich featuring Thomas Keller\\" features footage of the chef (and film's technical advisor) showing Adam Sandler how to make the killer looking (and apparently tasting) modified BLT that his character makes in the movie. Brooks narrates this extra which, in a nice touch, includes written ingredients and instructions so that you can make it on your own!zz songs.

B00005QW5X|5.0|Hedwig and the Angry Inch is one of my favorite films..This is interesting, because the first time I watched it I wasn't too pleased. I did not understand the story at all, since the plot line is extremely confusing(jumps back and forth, place to place) Although it was bizzare and kind of funny. I ended up watching it a second time, a third, a fourth, and with each time I watched it I began to like it more and more. I'm not sure why this is, but it's a movie with songs and charactars that really grow on you. After a while you'll start singing the songs and quoting the movie.
B000026FOA|5.0|Considering that Nick Drake's music is utterly breathtaking, emotionally connecting & life-affirming as it is.  It seems truly remarkable that his music was virtually ignored on its initial release.  A chronically shy person how expressed himself via his music, his breathy vocals, and gorgeous acoustic guitar arrangements, were (without me understating this) Exceptional....yet his songs of mortality, introspection, dark nights of the soul and mysterious haunting melodies didn't connect with the record buying public some 30 years ago, and this album, his debut....only sold a minuscule 2000 copies (??!!!) on release.  Nick would go on to record a further 2 albums of melancholic beauty, with still none of the sales to sustain his career.  What followed was a man who plunged further and further into depression, and would eventually overdose on anti-depressants (aged 26), and only over the last few years have the plaudits and celebrity musicians expressed their admiration and love for Nick's work, (even so far as to having a Documentary about his life, persented by 'Brad Pitt'). <br /> <br />Nick was one of the few English musicians at the time, taking Folk music and moving into the new wave of 'Progressive Folk' (introspective, intricate music that added new layers of musical and lyrical complexity), from the first song \\"Time Has told me\\", Nick intones in a world weary vocal over a lovely understated acoustic section \\"Time has told me, You're a rare rare find, A troubled cure....For a troubled mind\\", beautifully captures Nick's  gift for combining pastoral imagery with piercing self revelation.  A lush cacophony of string arrangements mark out \\"River Man\\", with Nick displaying a bittersweet level of melody unlike anyone else at the time of this albums release, and with Nick musing \\"Going to see the river man, Going to tell him all i can, About the ban...On feeling free\\", not even the beautiful strings and gentle guitar can disguise the achingly sad tone of the song.  \\"Way to Blue\\" is arguably one of the best known tracks on this album, and rightly so, its a song that highlights many of Nick Drakes attributes: remarkable instrumentation, anguished poignant vocals, subtle emotion, accessibility & an unsettling level of intimaticy, and lyricism far beyond his years: \\"Have you seen the land, Living by the breeze...Can you understand a light among the trees, Tell me all that you may know.....Show me what you have to show, Tell us all today....If you know the way to blue?\\" it feels like such a deeply personal song, that you almost feel like your intruding on someones personal memoirs, yet incapable of ignoring it's captivation content. <br /> <br />This album has a fuller arrangement than later albums (especially over the largely acoustic guitar driven \\"Pink Moon\\") This album was to feature prominent names in the growing English folk scene with: Dave Pegg (bass) Dave Mattacks (drums) both of Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson (ld gtr) ex-Fairport, John Cale (celeste, piano and organ) ex-Velvet Underground, Ray Warleigh (alto sax), Chris McGregor (piano) and Pat Arnold and Doris Troy (backing vocals), all contributing to the album with performances virtually equal to Drakes own insular beautiful performance.  But nothing detracts from the sheer beauty of this album. <br /> <br />For those that don't have any Nick Drake Albums, this truly is a absolute must-buy, I can't think on any reason that anyone that considers themselves to like Folk (progressive or otherwise), or feels that they have a wide variety of music that they listen to, should not own this album!!!  Is this Nick Drakes best album???...I find that question impossible to personally answer.  Critics point this album as his best....\\"Bryter Layter\\" was his most popular album, and \\"Pink Moon\\" is my personal favourite (go Figure??).  The fact that this man only sold 2000 copies of this album when it was released kills me everytime it hear it mentioned.  And the fact that even with the re-evaluation of his career, and a world-wide new found love for his work, this album has still only sold 250,000 copies, and highlights that even music as stunningly timeless as this, doesn't always find an audience.  All three of his albums deserve to be owned, because no one album feels weaker than another, and they complement each other beautifully.  Put it this way.....every single friend that I've convinced (hassled??) to buy a Nick Drake album, owns all three of them.  This is timeless music, that might have been ignored first time around, but now is truly worth of the Renaissance, and I impore you to not pass on this, like the listeners did some 30 years ago.  Utterly breathtaking music....!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|This album is just the epitome of bad, but yet worshipped music. There is really no other way to put it other than the music is just awful. The lyrics are awful, their sound is nerve racking, and I've heard dying cats who can sing better than Kurt Cobain. I suppose it's only fair to blame the herion. Only something like herion could drive a person to create such atrocious noise. If you want to hear some good 90's music, buy Alice in Chains greatest hits.
B0000029DD|4.0|Jeff buckley's voice is legendary, and this album is the only album he made.  It is filled with atmospheric, overpowering music that is quite transporting in most places, but occasionally not that strong.  for one thing, the song \\"lilac wine\\" is kind of dumb, i think, and I prefer the leonard cohen version of \\"hallelujah.\\"  (though jeff's version is stunning, I must say).  I am not a huge fan of Jeff's work, but I recognize his genius and his ultrasexed singing as being unique and powerful.  I recommend this album to any music fan.
0553266306|5.0|Today in Britain Frederick Forsyth is best known as a right wing Anti-European Little Englander whose beliefs revolve around how hard done to are the British farmers and military.<br /><br />That's a pity as The Day of the Jackel is probably the best thriller ever written. Given that the plot is about an attempt to murder General DeGaulle, which we know must fail, this is quite an achievement.<br /><br />Set in the early sixties a group of OAS terrorists determined to avenge what they see as DeGaulle's betrayal of French Algeria, hire an English hitman to murder the French head of state.<br /><br />The killer is known only as The Jackel and the plot unfolds as he plans to make the hit and the French police try to catch him before he can murder DeGaulle.<br /><br />The book has a number of flaws, the main one being that the Jackel is hard to catch because he has no record with any police agency in the world. If that his so, how did the OAS find him. Surely the French police could use the same route.<br /><br />This book does not rush, the Jackels preparations are painstakely set out, as are the efforts of the French and British police to catch him. Given that it is quite slow Forsyth's achievement is to keep the reader gripped with the wish to know what happens next.<br /><br />Beware however Forsyth's flics are not Maigret, they kidnap, torture and intimidate anyone who may be of use to them.<br /><br />Most of Forsyth's later thrillers are OK although some are real stinkers. Only his second book, The Odessa File comes close to matching the Day of the Jackel in the keep the page turning stakes.<br /><br />It's a pity that Forsyth or Freddie as his admirers call him did not stick to writing thrillers. If he had, we could just admire his work and not have to ignore his politics.
B000002UJQ|5.0|kudos to the previous reviewer.  I won't bother with the other people who hate the album, and just analyze the music herein. <br /> <br />This is quite an unusual and thrilling album.  As thom yorke put it, they were tired of being a purely drums-guitar-bass band, and they wanted to branch out, like any inspired band with the creative itch wants to.  And the result is this, which in many circles is thought of as the greatest album of all time. <br />What I say is, who am I to argue?  I wouldn't say it is the best thing I have ever heard, but it is purely different, brooding, textural, with things I have never heard on other albums.  It is kind of electro-rock, but that is quite a limited definition.  It is thrilling and brooding, never staying in the same tempo, shifting from song to song from occasional fast to occasional slow.  whirls and beeps abound.  iT is insanity.   <br /> <br />And its really good, though it will probably have to grow on you until you become obsessed.  a thrilling musical ride that is highly worth it, I recommend you get this and The Bends for the best of Radiohead.  What an unusual band!  doubtless, we can expect more great things from them.
B0007WF1WI|5.0|I only bought the dualdisc because i didn't buy the original one over a year ago, someone burned the CD for me and it is such a great CD so thats why i bought it now. I love all the tracks on the album, All the singles released from it where great, my favoruites that wherent released as singles are: <br /> <br />(I Got That) Boom Boom <br />Showdown <br />Breathe On Me <br />Early Mornin' <br />Touch Of My Hand <br />The Hook Up <br />Shadow <br />Brave New Girl <br /> <br />basically all the other songs on the album!!!
B000002H33|5.0|this album piledrives like no other album, and it is truly a tale of darkness, trickery, and power plays in the modern world, especially relating to war.  The cover, which is one of the best covers I have ever seen, says it all about this cd.  This is Metallica lean and mean, before they made junk like they do now.  Pretty much everything they made during the 80's is classic material, but this cd is their best work (although the black album has broader musical visions, and is much more accessible).  chugging along with fastness and precision is the hallmark of this album, occasionally slowing down to the eerie yet beautiful sections of music on several songs, such as the title track.  A good example of this is \\"orion,\\" a terrific instrumental and my favorite track on the album.  Its absolute brilliance, I wish they had made more instros like that one.   <br /> <br />Man, this cd brings back memories of when I was just starting to collect music.  It was the first album I bought (besides the black album) that can officially be placed in \\"classic\\" status.  If you are new to Metallica pick up this cd, Ride the Lightning (which I haven't got but I plan to get it eventually!) and their self titled \\"black album.\\"  Enjoy!  Unfortunately, this band has no greatest hits collection, which is a shame because it could really help introduce new fans to their older music, at a much reduced price.  Not that they were really a hits band anyway, they were steadfastly determined to make songs that were well arranged, lengthy, and suited to album format.
B000003CUJ|4.0|In having read the other reviews of this CD, I think many individuals failed to take note of the original intent behind this CD coming about in the first place.  Lorin Maazel was commissioned by the recording company (Telarc) to come up with an arrangement of the prime orchestral excerpts of the \\"Ring,\\" and his 4-step approach listed in the booklet, makes it abundantly clear that NOT ALL of the music commonly heard on other recordings of the orchestral music from the \\"Ring,\\" would be heard in this arrangement.  Also, it is to be inferred that Maazel knows, and obviously doesn't expect his arrangement to take the place of ANY complete recording of the \\"Ring.\\" <br /> <br />I heard Maazel conduct his arrangement live with the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, DC last year.  Before that concert, I had never listened to this recording, but I knew about it.  So I had the advantage of going into the concert with a fresh mind. <br /> <br />I came out of the concert with the feeling that others before me expressed -- that some of the transitions between familiar excerpts were smooth, some so-so, and others rather clunky.  I think Maazel would be the first to admit that he was more successful in some areas of his arrangement, and not as successful in others.  So be it.  Wagner is tough for anyone and everyone delving into the complete operas, whatever their command of German and musical/orchestral principles. <br /> <br />So, my rating and review of this recording is confined to Maazel's task at hand.  I give his effort four stars.  Most of this \\"grade\\" is confined to the arrangement itself.  I give the orchestral playing five stars.
B000005J56|5.0|I don't understand the people who say that this album sounds \\"washed up\\" or \\"out of place\\" with real Cuban music.  I suppose a hardcore cuban music fan might have objections with Ry's blues guitar, which I happen to like.  But for a person who doesn't have a lot of strong ties to world music, this cd is a wonderful addition to the collection, and is quite a classic album.  All of the songs are awesome, the musicians are extremely strong on here, and it is just a terrific album.  other reviewers are just trying to be extremely elitist; their complaints really have no basis in how this album sounds.  If you are a fan of Santana, Linda Ronstadt, Pink Martini and similar artists, you will definitely enjoy this piece of work.  Highly Recommended.  It is fun and amazing work.
0765309408|4.0|Overall, a good read with an interesting plot, good ideas, and lots of bug-eyed monsters in the best space opera tradition.  The sole negative thing I would observe is that the writing style was average at best, with the zippy juvenile dialog among the protagonist and his friends being the most annoying feature.  This was definitely outweighed by the entertainment value of the narrative, however.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is the most accessible of the Radiohead catalogue, but I don't think it is as stunning an introduction as OK Computer was.  It is also not as rewarding in the long run.  Nevertheless, it is really good and all the songs are fun to listen to.  People occasionally find Yorke's voice to be too whiny, and it really just depends on the song.  I find his singing to be awesome, and it helps set Radiohead apart from other bands, makes people know it is THEM on the radio.  THe songs on here have a straightforward beauty to them, especially the first few songs which in general are brooding and ethereal.  Radiohead isn't my favorite band, but they have such good music that they are worth the time I put aside to listen to them.  It is always worth it.

B00005MP58|5.0|I read the book in a few short days, staying up until the wee hours one morning to finish it because I was unable to put it down.  I immediately went out and purchased the movie to quench my newfound obsession for Jane Austen's amazing story :)  The movie is delightful.  It was pure joy to see Austen's witty words spoken with all the marvelous acting and period dress and scenery.  Colin Firth, now famous as Mr. Darcy, plays the role superbly with subtlety and depth.  Jennifer Ehle as the \\"headstrong\\" Eliza Bennet is also delightful, and it is fun to pour over their scenes together and witness the nuances of emotion.  Everyone involved has done justice to Jane Austen's novel - making the movie almost as much fun to treasure as the book!
B000031WD9|5.0|This movie was a funny laugh out loud sleeper hit with an almost unknown cast this movie made them stars. American Pie has some of the most Hilarous moments I have ever seen on film. You actually find yourself feeling embarssed when you watch the mishaps that happen to the lead character Jim and his buddies. This movie is about four friends who are in their senior year of high school... Jim ( biggs) is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents discover when they catch him jacking off with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are also aching to be devirginized, so they all make a pledge a pact if you will they will have sex with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to be to have the luck, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid),But do they want the same thing kevin wants to get it on vicky wants i love you yous. Oz is a good-looking jock who is a nice guy he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to rush into the things which may put a break on Oz's plan. Finch has no immediate prospects, he is the nerd of the group but soon a rumor is being told about finch and suddenly every girl wants to know if those rumors about him are true. But Jim is a truly hopeless case he falls for a beautiful exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) he tries to seduce Nadia but ends up making a complete fool out of himself. So he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who doesn't stop talking about band camp. But she rocks Jims world with a story of her flute and shows him you can't judge by a book by it's cover. This movie is a must for any comedy fan.It also has the most funny line by Alyson Hannigan. This movie didn't win any oscars its lude and crude but it's a laugh out loud comedy. But what sets this movie apart from all the lude and crude sex comedies of the past is that oddly enough American pie is a sex comedy with a heart. The Outtakes on the Dvd is funny as hell.***** five stars and two thumbs up.rom all the lude and crude sex comedies of the past is that oddly enough American pie is a sex comedy with a heart.

B000244FDW|3.0|After having obsessed over first the book, and then the A&E adaptation (all within a week), I have now seen the BBC's adaptation from the 1980s.  I have to say I think it pales in comparison to the famous A&E version.  I do agree that this version (the BBC version) is true to much of Jane Austen's dialogue and is probably more authentic to the period with the stiff, emotionless acting... but it's just entirely too dull.  I LOVE Austen's words, but why watch a 4 hour reading of her words with very little acting or emotion?  The A&E version may be a little more \\"Hollywood\\", but I think it brings to the screen all the emotions and depth read on Austen's pages, which this BBC version is completely incapable of.  The actors are stiff and lifeless.  As I said, that may be more true to the decorum of the time period, but completely unentertaining in film.  <br />It's worth noting that the A&E version is also true to much of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice.  It's just that, in contrast to this lifeless version, the A&E adaptation is much more vibrant and emotional - an adaptation I think Jane Austen would have enjoyed :)
B0007GAEW6|1.0|I can't remember the last time I was more disappointed with an album. I have a collection of over 500 bought CDs, and I almost never return or re-sell anything. this CD has the dubious distinction of being one of the few (maybe 10) returns.  <br />   I thought \\"de-loused\\" was great. It was like a mix of OLD Voi-Vod & Rush, but totally original at the same time. The lyrics were ambiguous, but there was an overall theme to the disc that I appreciated. If there is any meaning to the lyrics in this album it has escaped me. And oh, by the way, half of the lyrics are in Spanish.  <br />   The mood of the music on this CD is also very different than their previous effort. \\"De-loused\\" was dark, agressive and dynamic. This is not agressive (its more like happy music) and the dynnamics are awful. Half of this album is just noise. Is this some new form of minimalist noise? I am familiar with post-rock and ambient techno (both of which I like) so i have heard artistic noise. Starting a song with a minute and a half of clicking noises is not artistic, it's just annoying. I absolutely HATE this album. GOOD RIDDANCE.

This album came out the best the beatles could offer to anyone.. listen to the \\"other\\" hits of that year. the beatles knocked them out like ali to frazer.  <br /> <br />but i wonder, what if sgt pepper and mmt some how came together? title it \\"1967\\" or somthin idk.. but look at what you have. the best work ever made with so much  <br /> <br />MMT is more creative then sgt..  by a long shot

0060763280|1.0|This book is a short read and clearly a sales pitch to something else . Ekers distorts facts to suit his thesis which even then amounts to little more than dross . My favorite example is the statistic about lottery winners . He claims that most winners who subsequently end up broke or at their pre-winning level of wealth has to do a mental state or attitude about wealth he likens to a thermostat . The fact is that of those who win lotteries or have large windfalls , people who have savings , regardless of their wealth level , tend to have their lives permanently enriched .People without savings generally loose large windfalls . This fact is known to me because I used it in a paper for college some years ago .     Eker's does not even touch on the fact that self made wealthy people have a commitment to reality . They understand that you cannot consume more than you produce . They know that you CANNOT have your cake and eat it too . People with a commitment to reality would find very little of value in this book .      While he does raise a valid point about attitudes towards money and wealth , he totally misses the point that these attitudes are steeped in irrationality in order to sell you his cure which is little more than half baked generalities . There is nothing of substance here other than a few modestly entertaining  annecdotes . If you are in the process of building wealth , do not waste your time or money on this .       If you are considering the training which this book is a sales pitch for , remember this fact ; you can only be trained by others to obey . The ability to think for yourself comes from within . Steer well clear of this dross .
B000089RV6|5.0|That's all you need to do , don't listen to the imbeciles that rate this low  , as they are not even worth reading , every song here is a rock staple EVERY one , It's part of the musical landscape that even people who have no clue on rock/metal know this album . 25 years after it's release and it still sherds any new band's output . Back in Black is rock and roll the way it's meant to be Tough as nails .
B0002IQJUK|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" attests to the undeniable talent that Gavin DeGraw possesses. All of his songs on the album are amazing and exhibit his strong and unique voice. The cover of \\"Change is Gonna Come\\" by Sam Cooke only cements the power of Gavin's voice and his ability to convey emotion. This is one of the best CD's I've purchased in years.
0316172324|1.0|This lighweight book is a surprise. You do expect some analysis and content when reading a book on the current state of thinking about brain activity.  There is no substance here. <br />There are lots of anecdotes about supposedly instant analysis of tennis swings, statues, and the like. The thing that is not credited is the time, effort, study and intellectual training it takes to erect the pattern recognition process that is behind these \\"instant\\" decisions.  (As if an untrained individuals' instant conclusion about anything would be of any value whatsoever.)  There are trained people in many professions who can arrive at a conclusion quickly -- especially on how to categorize a situation or an object which relates to their field. They have internalized the schema of that field, and it is this unconscious competance that makes them an expert. So --- what else is new here? <br />Not a piece I would compare with Penrose, Dennett or any of the scholars of brain activity.  Sadly, in my opinion, I wasted my time.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album, the second of the four, is often regarded (rightly so) to be their most punishing to the ears.  Basically, everything that is promising about the debut (buy before this...actually buy all four of the albums in chronological order) is done louder, harder, and trashier here.  The sex, drugs and all out assult on rock and roll is simply more pronounced on WLWH.    It all begins with the first notes of \\"White Light White Heat.\\"  The no set-up intro gets the show on the road without wasting any time.  The song is perhaps the best tecnically on the album with everything working together to get that drug-like high.  Track two is a bit different.  In one ear you hear a wonderful story of a man who mails himself to see his ex ultimately ending with his death while in the other ear you hear a continuous jam that produces some of the greatest highs on the record in terms of guitar play (certainly the best on side one...).  You have not heard anything like it, trust me.  \\"Lady Godiva\\" is a nice rocker with a fun story and a relentless beat.  Catchy as hell too! \\"Here She Comes\\" ends side one on a light note (only one on the ablum) but does not disappoint at all. Also catchy, it is one of Reed's best pop songs.    Side Two is where this record succeeds the most.  \\"Heard Her Call My Name\\" begins as almost a continuation of \\"Here She Comes\\" but just as loud as it was soft.  The guitars flood the ears more so than any song the VU ever made.  It sounds like the music you would be hearing on a rollercoater ride to hell. Truely a great rock and roll song.  And then the closer, \\"Sister Ray\\".  This could very well be the greatest achievement in the history of the electric guitar playing and is the best guitar Lou and the Velvets would ever put to record.  What else can be said...the song will instantly become your favorite Velvet Undergound track.  All 17+ minutes of it are brutal but rewarding.  What a way to end an album as hard and rough as this.    Basically, this is thepeak of the Velvet Underground.  I can't say that this is a much better record than 'Nico' but I will say that it took the formula a step further.  Both are top 20 of all time material so pick them both up.  Don't listen to the negitive reviews saying this is unlistenable.  I liked it the very first time I heard it.  So far and away ahead of its time too. Ahhhh........
B00009V8Z9|5.0|When my friend recommended for me to listen to Follow Through because this guy is the best male singer of this generation, I was kind of sketchy because of how people over-react. Most of the music out today is about sex, so how could this be different? After listening to Follow Through, I was thankful to realize that Gavin DeGraw can find better topics to write aobut than sex. <br /> <br />    A few months later I hear I Don't Want to Be and Chariot for the first time, and I was more than impressed. I listened to the rest of his album and was very pleased with his wide range of songs and stunning, soulful voice. I love More than Anyone very much and I appreciate that he doesn't say anything like \\"I want your body\\". All of his songs are different than anything out there (and that's good)! Gavin DeGraw is a unique person with a very unique voice and just could be the best male singer of this generation.
B00005JKGO|5.0|Federico Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA has been tooted as a monumental innovative film for its time.  It's been analyzed inside and out, backwards and forwards, and why the further analysis?  It doesn't hurt to add yet another perspective to previous criticism.  From a historical perspective, by the 1950s ended, much had occurred globally, politically, religiously, socially, and culturally.  This film was released during the height of the Cold War and Communism and Capitalism were knocking heads with one another, Italy was under continued reconstruction after WWII, Europe was getting its taste of rock and roll music, and it was a Beat Generation.  For whatever reason, Fellini opens the film with a statue of Jesus hanging from its seams by a helicopter that flies over Vatican City.  First, this definitely rings out religious change, i.e., the Catholic church lost a leader, Pope Pius XII, but experienced an enormous restructuring with Vatican II.  Fellini may have observed this change within the religious landscape and implements it with intermittent church scenes and miraculous visions that has gone with Catholicism as well as the \\"flying\\" Jesus statue that reappears through out the film.  There is a small tinge of religious and philosophical overtones that bears similarities to an Ingmar Bergman film, however, without the solemn and brooding approach that Bergman depicts in his characters and narrative.  Fellini's approach is somewhat ambiguous with a carnival atmosphere with \\"beautiful people\\" who aren't perfect at all, but almost follows the same premise as Bergman - the meaning of life, but in Fellini's case, \\"The Sweet Life\\".<br /><br />LA DOLCE VITA a film about love and the absence of love.  Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni), main character, lives the good life, but as an observer, he sees the sweet as well as the bittersweet life that exist with his friends and acquaintances.  Fellini states:  \\"There is an effort to show a world without love, characters full of selfishness, people exploiting one another...\\" (DVD inner sleeve).  He envies his friend, Steiner, who lives a \\"structured\\" life with his wife and two kids and the intellectual salon that he holds at his home.  But how ironic, Steiner commits suicide near the end of the film and takes his dearly loved children with him while his wife was away running an errand.  As for Marcello, he cannot bear to be \\"tied down\\" to a conventional life, and would rather embrace his \\"teddy boy\\" image and Rome's nightlife by living it up until dawn while he's still young and carefree.  But at the same time, he cannot bear to leave his suicidal girlfriend, Emma, as Fellini depicts this scene where Marcello leaves her on an abandoned dirt road but later returns before sunrise.  In the middle of it all, Fellini includes a scene with Marcello's father who does not want to intrude on his son's life.<br /><br />Overall, LA DOLCE VITA is a cinematic masterpiece. It has been mocked by television, other movies, and music videos of the 1980s.  The film itself will appeal to art and film students and anyone in between for further imitation and study.  It is extremely long, with it clocking in at 2 hours and 54 minutes, but with so much going on, one will not notice the length of time.  It is one unique film simply was ahead of its time.people exploiting one another...\\" (DVD inner sleeve).

0192802380|4.0|Classical novel, written by Jane Austen, was very entertaining and funny when reading it. Its about a mother trying to get her daughters married to rich, handsome men, such as a man named Darcy. He is stuck-up, yet handsome and he he knows what he's worth. This novel leave you satisfied!
0385510454|3.0|Grisham was never an espionage specialist as he proves in this novel. He should have stuck to writng his law novels. The Broker has a crackling dialogue and it moves fast, but the espionage details are sadly insipid. The setting research is good, but it also sounds like an Italian language tutor. I wouldn't recommend this novel, unless you read a novel purely for its pace.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|This CD has some phenomenal music on it, but it's ruined by the mindless nothings used to make the songs last more than a couple minutes. <br /> <br />The most disappointing of all was The Widow. The beginning, I admit, is probably one of my favourite songs ever. But about 3 minutes in, for no reason whatsoever, instead of ending a good song, these idiots decided to just leave obnoxious electronic static for 2 minutes. <br /> <br />Huge disappointment. Expected a lot more, but obviously all the talk was hype.
B00005JNTV|4.0|I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that \\"Sin City\\" was being made into a movie, I shuddered.  I could just imagine what Hollywood would do to it: cast it wrong, colorize it, water it down, change crucial plot points, sap it like \\"Howard the Duck.\\"   <br /> <br />My spirits lifted when I learned it would be directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, though I wasn't sure what to make of the fact that so much of it would be digitally generated. <br /> <br />In the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print-to-screen adaptation as this.  The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique. <br /> <br />I liked this movie a lot but at the same time, it left me feeling a little strange.  It's like seeing your favorite indie band suddenly catapaulted from obscurity to arena-sized stages, hearing your favorite obscure song become a Top Ten hit.   <br /> <br />It also made me wish there was a way I could've experienced it without having read the books first, because if you've read the books, you know almost every single thing that's going to happen when and how it's going to happen.  That's more a criticism of myself as a reader/viewer than it is of the artist or filmmakers. On the other hand, as close as the transition is, the material still unavoidably loses something when recreated in live action, just by the nature of the severity of the actions.  Miller's sharp images are paced as precisely as rifle reports and there's a strange difference between, say, seeing a drawing of Marv dragging a man behind his car and seeing several seconds of footage of Marv dragging a man behind his car.  Still, had I been given the choice between seeing an accurate adaptation and a bad adaptation, I definitely would've chosen this one.  This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation.     <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|I haven't read the books. I've seen all 3 movies and I think this one was the best of the three.  <br />Yes, they left things out. Yes, a few things were out of order...but this is a movie not a book. <br />I felt this was a better movie, because it had the length and pacing of a movie.  <br />My big complaint with the first 2 was that they were structured just as the books were, one chapter after another. This lead to the first 2 films being WAY too long. Even watching them on video I could barely sit through each in one stretch. You could just count the chapters as they ticked by, it was almost like I was watching 20 episodes of a 30 minute television show all strung together. <br />In contrast, the 3rd film is a normal movie length and the plot and pacing is brisk and exciting. I was never confused by the plot as some reviewers have suggested was a problem. It all made perfect sense to me. And what's more, I was absolutely absorbed for the length of the film. I never felt like there was a slow part that was there just so the movie would be absolutely faithful to the book.  <br />Hearing that there were parts left out of the film just inspires me to read the book and explore the story in more depth.  <br />This film definitely had a lot more emotional impact than the first too, as well. Cuaron is a much better director than Columbus.

B00003W8NM|4.0|David Fincher's best film so far is violent, hilarious, disgusting (verbally and phyisically) and fun. Brad Pitt stars as Tyler Durden, Edward Norton is credited as \\"narrator\\" and Helena Bonham Carter as sexpot Marla Singer. Norton flies off to L.A. where he meets a new \\"friend\\" (Pitt) who sells soap causes mischief and later, starts fight clubs. Later, Pitt asks Norton to hit him, and then the two start brutally punching and kicking each other. Soon, this \\"sport\\" has now developed all over the country. But, Pitt has his own agenda. This movie is weird, although at times downright hilarious such as Pitt and Norton hitting golf balls into random places, fight club members doing their homework (getting into a fight, and losing). And Pitt sometimes says the most gross things, such as admitting he reads porn and masturbates, and the most gross thing he says is \\"chop a penis off and throw it out the window\\" But one scene where he holds up a liquor store clerk with an unloaded gun and the things he says are profound. <br /> <br />Overall, a very good movie. <br /> <br />Rating: 7/10
B00004XOWM|4.0|While I don't think that Limp Bizkit is that talented and I think that Fred Durst is a loser without much going for him I think that some people need to grow up and shut the hell up if they are gonna talk s***. If you don't like Fred and Wes that's fine (personally if you listen to Wes's music then its pretty damn good). An online review is to talk about the music. Fred Durst sings the music. If you don't like him then fine, but I don't think that half of the reviewers actually listened to the CD. Otherwise they would know that there are some good songs on it. I am with you when you say that they shouldn't have jacked Watch Amy Play from Pink Floyd, but Hot Dog, while incredibly stupid, is also incredibly musical. I play guitar way better than any of you. Do you know how I can tell? I can tell from how you slam on Hot Dog. It's a complicated song and very hard to play. The lyrics, oh well, its just a chance for Fred to drop a bunch of F-bombs. But how about Boiler guys? It's known for being one of the ultimate break-up songs. But then I guess losers like you guys have never had a girlfriend to break up with then have you? Rollin' is a good song as well. My point is that, while it's not the best, this is a good CD. Why don't you borrow a copy and listen to it, then rewrite your review. My name is Clint Westbrook and in case any of you stupid MFers have a problem you can reach me at staindsol_16@hotmail.com. If you have a decent arguement about why you think Limp Bizkit suck then I'd gladly listen to it cause everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Anyways, look for Limp's new album in May of 2005 titled The Unquestionable Truth Part 1. I've heard the first track and I think it kicks ass if you really want to know. Peace. <br /> <br />Clint <br /> <br />NEVER GIVE IN TO THE WILL OF THE SPLINTERED MIND FOR IT WILL DESTROY YOU!!!
B0007P3582|3.0|5o inherited the beef wit Ja Rule sayin that he makes to many love songs. GRODT was a good album becuz unlike his rival, he made songs just for gangstas and real n*ggaz. Only one song was a love song(21 Questions)! The Massacre has only 5 or 6 good hood songs. Rest are wack.  <br />Just to name some of the wack songs: <br />Piggybank (If he really wanted to start somthin' then he should've added more disses) <br />Candy shop (regardless of radio play, this song simply sucks) <br />God Gave me Style (a try by 50 to make songs like DMX) <br />.....and alot more! <br />Some songs that were good are: <br />I'm suppose to die tonight (Pretty good song, straight up gangsta song) <br />In my hood (shout out to his hood) <br />.....and couple more! <br /> <br />if u really wanna BUY it, buy a bootleg. I wouldn't waste 15 bucks for this. <br />
0385336810|1.0|Count me as one of the few who cannot believe all of the good reviews this book is getting.  I liked the Shop books, but this was just silly.  Perhaps it was written with the idea of it becoming a screenplay...I can kind of see that.  But as an interesting/entertaining book?  No.  It was totally predictable from the very beginning.
B000001GAE|2.0|.. but nothing more! It's a superb reading of the Sonata, but no soul, no feelings! Nuages gris is absolutely flat, less than a exercise for tremolandos! <br />Surprising, because Pollini's Chopin is marvellous, full of passion and feeling! But here, is hard to feel Liszt's poetry and tragic dilemma in Mr. Pollini playing! <br />Better playing - Sonata: Yundi Li (DG), Dubravka Tomsic (IPO); Nuages Gris: Hamelin (Hyperion).

B0007GAERG|5.0|Sadly the haters will have you believing anything and everything about Mariah. The only thing that is for certain is that \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is a great album. Mariah must have had another great sales week so the haters will put any spin necessary on it. This is the best showing of her voice. The songs really demonstrate its unmatched versatility. There is no other voice like Mariah Carey and this album proves it. The jealousy will continue to rear its ugly head because all the other competing record labels figured her as being washed up. They didn't know she would comeback this good. And they'll make any excuse to diminish her talent and accomplishments. Thankfully, Mariah has been emancipated and now the voice we all know and love can take center stage.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Albert Schweitzer once famously said that happiness was nothing more than good health and bad memory.   This movie is a philosophical critique of this notion disguised as a love story.      What gives us more grief than a painful breakup?  What if we could just erase it?  Would we be happy then?  Would what was lost be worth what was gained?  And even if you could erase a bad relationship, would just just do keep making the same mistakes again and again anyways?    Excellent performances by the entire cast.
B00000J7S8|2.0|Unimpressive.  The arrangements, recording and backup are great, Diana is terrible. She has absolutely no vocal refrain.  Her ability to create passion is nonexistant.

B0007GAERG|5.0|We had a longer wait for this album, but man was it worth it!!! She is singing her heart out on this album and getting closer to the &quot;real&quot; Mariah....more r&amp;b and gospel.  The Kanye West produced track &quot;Stay the Night&quot; is one of the best, along with JoyRide, Fly Like a Bird, Shake it off, well they are ALL AWESOME!!!<BR>If you love Mariah, YOU NEED THIS ALBUM! This is one of her best, up with the ranks of Butterfly and Daydream...a must have!
B00005JNQ8|4.0|**Warning!   Contains spoilers** <br /> <br />As a director myself, my personal belief is that we don't need to see certain things, one of which is nose mucus---in other words, snot and boogers.   The scene where Kidman is crying after hearing about the death of her brother contains just such yuckies and I can't believe Pollack and/or his editor didn't fix it.   Now, having said that, the performances are excellent.   For those who think Sean Penn monotones his way through the film, in my opinion he is supposed to be deadened by the continual infidelity and recent death of his wife, and when one is deadened a monotone frequently results.   Plus, the character is supposed to be drinking heavily at times, which would also contribute to the way he sounds.   I found Penn's performance both touching and believable, and the makeup was perfect: he looked haggard and miserable, like a guy who can't sleep and drinks too much.   Kidman delivers her usual sensitive and intelligent performance; she's the Meryl Streep of her generation.   Is there anything the woman can't do?   She is superbly talented.   She has the accent down pat as well, which I found important in that it gave the character great believablity. <br /> <br />Now for the plot holes. <br /> <br />It's always interesting to me how screenplays are given short shrift---remember the old adage about the Hollywood starlet who was so stupid she slept with the screenwriter, not knowing he had no power whatsoever?   If the story has holes the size of Cleveland in it, I don't care how wonderful the performances,  direction and production values are, the intelligent viewer---and by that I mean someone who can relate to \\"House of D\\" and \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\"; in other words, character- and story-driven as opposed to CGI- and sex-driven films---you just don't believe in the movie.    <br /> <br />For example: the initial premise is downright silly.   Let's see: Kidman as Silvia Broome going back to get her flute happens to overhear people talking about an assassination plot?     Get real!    Why would you discuss such a thing in one of the most microphoned and videotaped buildings in the world?   Another thing: they've obviously seen her (because Kidman's character turned the light on briefly), so why don't they kill her immediately?   Hell, they can find out where she lives with no problem, which leads to another plot hole: why on earth wasn't she secreted in a safe house as soon as they believe that her tale of the assassination threat is real? <br /> <br />One last gripe: actors in film work largely with their eyes, so Kidman's scraggy overbleached hair falling all over her face drove me nuts.   Same thing with Penn's partner Dot Woods; I seriously doubt a female Secret Service agent would have all that hair flopping in her way.    <br /> <br />I will give the screenwriter credit for not falling into the most annoying trap of all, which is having Kidman and Penn fall in love, with all its resident fish kissing---whatever happened to kissing like you meant it, as opposed to seeing how far you can open your mouth and inhale somebody's tongue?   Not to mention languid backlighted shots of them having sex, etc., etc.   At least they were wary of each other, although they did respond to each other compassionately as people.   Very, very few films have ever shown male-female relationships except in the tiresome context of sex.    \\"Norma Rae\\" is one of the few which comes to mind.   This continual male/female sexual context might best be explained by the fact that a lot of screenwriters are males who wouldn't know what a non-sexual friendship between a man and a woman was in the first place---unless one or both of the parties were gay.    As I have often observed over the years, Hollywood is a horny stupid town.   No wonder poor David Duchovny's first film is being vilified. <br /> <br />Now for the good things:  Pollack's direction is sure-handed as usual.   Shooting at the actual UN addsauthenticity, and the bus bombing scene I thought was first-rate, with no silly lingering shots of blood, death and gore.   Pollack, a highly intelligent director, has always been known for his imagination and restraint.   The performances as mentioned previously are excellent with the exception of one scene: that in which Penn yells at Kidman, saying she is lying, was obviously to me picked up and filmed before the actors had time to work up to pitch; the pacing is noticeably off.   It's the only lapse between the two actors in the film.   The small characters were much more fascinating than usual; Catherine Keener, who played Penn's partner was consistently interesting.   I'd like to see more of her.   And it was great that she was neither beautful nor ugly, which is what you usually find in casting.   In real life most people are ordinary, and to me film should reflect that.   The various members of the Secret Service team Penn headed were refreshingly minorities who tried hard and weren't perfect.   Minorities in my opinion are vastly underused in film.   And I particularly liked the surprising revelation at the end that Silvia Broome had had a love affair with Ajene Zola and that it ended because she was white. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a good film with a flawed screenplay---but aren't they all.
B000002UJQ|2.0|I have listened to this album 4 or 5 times now and I still dont understand why people think its soo great. I mean this album was recently voted the greatest album ever in a channel 4 '100 greatest' program here in the UK, and I also seem to remember it getting the same accolade from 'Q Magazine' back in the late nineties. I just dont get it. There are 2 songs I do like on here, 'Paranoid Android' and 'No Surprises'. In fact, 'No Surprises' is probably the most beautiful song I've ever heard. But as for the rest of the album, it sucks. I dunno, maybe I'm not mature enough to appreciate this alleged classic, but I do reccomend people buy this album because of its critical acclaim and see for themselves if they can figure out whats so good about it.
B0008JFMFQ|1.0|Two Perspectives <br /> <br />Non-Political <br />Have you ever been in an in-closed space with someone who repeats the same thing over and over and over again? Have you ever wished you didn't feel obligated to sit in a theater and watch a movie you just paid 8.50 for? If the answer to both of these questions is yes then maybe you wont waste an hour or so of your life watching this horrible movie. I would try at this point to say something, anything, positive about this movie but there is nothing there, zero, its the worse movie I have ever seen, ever, when it was over my wife said \\"You never pick another movie again, ever.\\" Recommend this movie to people you really hate deep down inside but are forced to be nice to. <br /> <br />Politically <br />This movie has been endorsed and partially funded by the government of China. China's government is Communistic. China wants everyone to know that it is better to have one bad government than many smaller, happier, friendlier, ones. The government of China runs over it's people with tanks when it is unhappy with them. <br />
B000001EXR|2.0|It is okay to go in a slightly different route musically. But if you must, do it in a way that doesn't suck. What kiss should of done if they wanted to go in a different direction was add just a little bit of the grunge. But unfortunately they added too much and they sounded horrible. Also the one song that seemed like it would of been a good song was \\"I walk alone\\". But it got ruined by Bruce Kulick's crapy singing. Kiss should never atempt grunge again because they suck at it. I'm glad that they went into a more rock sound with psycho circus. I thought that was a good album a whole lot better than this garbage.
B000002BQK|5.0|This is the first Mariah album that I ever bought so it definitely holds a place in my heart.  After buying it, I bought her previous albums and although impressive, none really reached out and grabbed my listening sensability like Butterfly did.  I know that a large part of her fan base loved her debut album and Music Box but to me, Butterfly is just sheer perfection - I listen to it without skipping a single song and have purchased it 3 times since it was released simply because I wore out the first two from overplay!  My favorites/stand out tracks in no particular order: <br /> <br />The 1st single, Honey caught my attention because of the World Famous Supreme team sample used geniously, I might add (it's always nice to hear a song from back in the day sampled in a good way & no one does it quite like Mariah) - 10/10 <br /> <br />Butterfly - hated the video but...I got where she was coming from during that period.  This is another beautiful Mariah ballad that speaks about freedom and breaking away from old conventions/thoughts/etc - 10/10 <br /> <br />Fourth of July - exquisite ballad!  Loved how her vocals were layered using her upper & lower registers to sound like a chorus of people.  Shame this song was not released as a single - 10/10 <br /> <br />Breakdown - loved the rap/r&b mix.  Her vocals with Bone, Thugs & Harmony is genius on this track.  They don't overpower each other and I love how she speeded up her singing style to match their rap style - 10/10 <br /> <br />Whenever You Call - this ballad makes me cry everytime I hear it, it's just a lovely song and she sounds great - 10/10 <br /> <br />Fly Away - great remix/instrumental - 10/10 <br /> <br />The Beautiful Ones - excellent remake that grew on me, love the mix of her & Sisquo's voices, they didn't quite match the original but then who can top Prince? but their remake is quite good  - 8.5/10 <br /> <br />The Roof - a song that tells a story about a lost love.  I love the remixes with Mobb Deep  9/10 <br /> <br />Close My Eyes - another excellent ballad   10/10 <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL THESE FOOLS GIVING THIS ALBUM 1 STAR. They are just haters. This is the only album that I can play over and over again without getting bored and without skipping a track, no matter what kind of mood im in. It still sounds as fresh now as it did back in 91'. Sure there is alot of hype surrounding this album, but it more then lives up to it. This, for me, is as close to perfection you can get. Even the album cover is the best ever, the iconic picture of the baby in water trying to grab the money. Beautiful.
0385510438|2.0|A college journalism dropout buys a struggling rural county newspaper in Mississippi, only to find himself embroiled in a sensational murder trial.  Really a portrait of the deep rural South in the decade after the end of Jim Crow, with some crime and suspense thrown in.   <br /> <br />But Grisham uses much of the novel to editorialize, through his protagonist, against the Vietnam War, against Wal-Mart, and in favor of forced busing.  The only area where conservatives come out well is where some of the best characters attend church regularly.  Read some politically incorrect history after reading this one to get a balanced view.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I rented this one to see if it was actually as bad as the premise would suggest.  It was.  Not only did I feel sick while watching this movie, I felt nauseous for the rest of the day. <br /> <br />I'm not talking about a squeamish kind of nausea; my stomach is a strong as they come.  I felt disgusted with myself for actually having watched and sat through this dog. <br /> <br />Sadly, there was a time in my teens when I would have absolutely loved this flick.   <br /> <br />PS-- I also felt cheated by the image of a rotary saw blade on the dvd, when all they used were cheap hacksaws... big difference.
0780622650|4.0|In response to the reviewer who is critical of older Lost n Space fans: I'm one of the \\"old fogies\\" who grew up on the original Lost In Space, but I have warm feelings for this remake too. Don't knock the \\"old fogies\\" who made the original popular. This version wouldn't have existed without the original. I do agree that this version deserves more credit. It's \\"new\\" and yet it doesn't fail to capture the imaginative fun of the original. It's a little too serious in places, but much of it is just imaginative fun just like in the \\"old days\\". It's very kid oriented and wildly fantastic. It has plenty of adventure and fun for my kids (and the kid in me) to enjoy. The makers were obviously fans of the original. They didn't abandon the spirt of the original. They didn't abandon the family audience. They did a good job on this.
B00008WT5E|5.0|The gazillion-seller \\"Back In Black\\" broke one of rock's greatest bands into the big time for good, but on sheer power and songwriting, nothing compares to \\"Powerage\\", the best album ever recorded by AC/DC.<br /><br />  Unlike the other Bon Scott-era albums that followed the predictable goofy AC/DC mold (reminding us that rock n' roll was originally intended to be fun), some serious thought to hooks and a tad bit of experimenting with the tried and true formula went into \\"Powerage\\".<br /><br />  The opener \\"Rock N' Roll Damnation\\" is a typical rocker that gets the album off to a good start, but as soon as \\"Down Payment Blues\\" begins, we see a sense of dynamics and a build-up to a furious climax that, prior to this song, was not a typical Young brothers element.  Other cuts like \\"Gimme A Bullet\\" and \\"What's Next To The Moon\\" show off hooks that are more melody oriented than we're used to, but still have the vintage AC/DC power chording and tempo that keep them from being wimpy.  The standout cut is \\"Riff Raff\\", a complicated lick and hook that is reminiscent of the heaviest Rick Derringer.  Bon screams for all it's worth over titanic guitars at a breakneck pace.  For those who are just now exploring earlier AC/DC work, it simply must be heard to be believed.<br /><br />  \\"Sin City\\" offers a riff that is a sign of things to come, primarily \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" and \\"Touch Too Much\\", and the closers, \\"Up To My Neck In You\\" and \\"Kicked In The Teeth\\" are in the \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" vein.<br /><br />  What makes this band great is a tenacious clinging to a winning and consistent formula, and most important, obviously loving every minute of it.  Poseurs will always burn out quickly, but those bands who truly believe in their music have the lasting power that enables them to reach across multiple generations, ala AC/DC, ZZTop, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, to name a few.  \\"Powerage\\" is the premier Bon Scott-era album.
B000005ZFN|5.0|This album was initially reviled by many critics when it first appeared in 1973, though Tull fans loved it so much that it went to number one on the charts. With time the music has been better explained, and music has evolved to the point where \\"A Passion Play\\" can be put into better perspective. However, the music and the composition, confusing as it may initially appear, allows you to recognize that this was an attempt to create an epic work. In some ways the work is unfinished, because the original studio sessions were cut short before the original concept was completed, and thus three albums sides of material had to be cut back to two. Some of the music originally intended for this album appeared on later albums; one example is \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day.\\"<br /><br />The album was intended to tell the story of a recently-deceased man seeing his own funeral, and his journey in the afterlife, including purgatory and hell, and eventual reincarnation. In addition to this primary story was the inclusion of \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,\\" a story likened to stories from Winnie the Pooh to Peter and the Wolf.<br /><br />\\"A Passion Play\\" combines ten tracks into a single work (according to the official Jethro Tull web site). As in \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" there is an occasional uneven spot in the transition from one track to the next. However, as in the former album, the transitions and concept works nearly as well. The music is certainly well refined, with hard-driving rock riffs, drums and synthesizers keeping Jethro Tull at the more experimental, progressive edge of rock. I warn you, though, that the music requires a good sound system to be able to listen to music that extends from very quiet to very loud. I compare this music to classical music, which similarly has sounds that extend from soft to loud, and also requires a good sound system. I also warn you to attempt to understand the lyrics at your own peril. The lyrics verge on the incomprehensible, even for those who have studied them at length. The lyrics are poetic and symbolic, and attempt to describe events and concepts barely attainable by the human mind, much less by a human language.<br /><br />Music such as this does not attempt to pander to a \\"style\\" or to commercial success. This music is art. Thus, its meaning, significance and relevance are to be interpreted by each listener. I will not pretend to tell you that I understand this work in its entirety. Perhaps it was never meant to be understood, in the manner of Yes's \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\" However, while I may not be able to define or understand progressive rock, I know it when I hear it, and this music is definitely progressive rock. Listen to this music only if you are prepared to be open-minded and to accept it for what it attempted to do, and not for the misguided interpretations of those who think they have been given the divine ability to judge the work of an artist as trash.incomprehensible, even for those who have studied them at length.

B000006045|5.0|There are some albums that, even if you don't own them, you are familiar with because they have built up a reputation over the years. Massive Attack's \\"Mezzanine\\" is one such album; I think from the time of this album's release in 1998, I have always known - just from looking at the cover - just who it was by. I never really had any desire to buy it, either, but five months ago I did. I'm not going to hail this album as one of my all-time favourites, because I don't think it is, but it certainly is an amazing album. If you can appreciate truly dark music (we're talking darker than dark) then this album is for you, most definitely.<br /><br />I suppose this is the kind of album you could lay on your bed to in the pitch dark, with your eyes closed, and just unfolding, letting the sound seep into your brain. The beats are deep and penetrating, the bass is pounding, reverberating like sound waves through water; at once near, then a million miles away. The sounds echo around you before drawing closer, disappearing, and then expanding all the time, closing in on themselves and crumpling under their own lead-heaviness. Imagine this album in Surround Sound. I bet it's incredible...<br /><br />The album opens with the moody \\"Angel.\\" This haunting and epic ballad begins with a distant bass which draws closer and louder, before the vocals of a mysterious female draw you in. \\"You...are my angel,\\" she whispers, before telling us she loves us, then letting the really magic begin. From that small particle of sound that opened the song grows a monster of a song, powered by a chugging beat that is relentless until the song's outro. \\"Risington\\" is an incredible piece of work, and was the first song to be debuted from the album in 1997. This song opens like echoes through water leading to the sooty vocals of a deep male voice. The chorus is incredible, and the dizzy but tranquil serenity before it is perfectly chilled. Clicks and bleeps reverberate in the background like a helicopter growing closer. The beat is twisted and primal at time, mixing perfectly with the lyrics, \\"Toy-like people make me boy-like.\\" Unquestionably the greatest song on the album follows, in the form of the absolute classic \\"Teardrop.\\" This is definitely one of my favourites songs of all time, because I am just in awe at its construction. The way the haunting vocals of Liz Fraser weave a sparkling web around the pounding heartbeat of a bass is awe-inspiring. Such a simple yet complex song. The first minute is incredible, as we gradually hear the bass getting louder before those sunlit vocals shine light into the immense darkness created by the piano. As the voice of that Goddess teeters on the edge around the fourth minute, before tumbling into the darkness, you'll experience something profoundly moving. Trust me.<br /><br />\\"Inertia Creeps\\" is a song that has an unnerving quality to it and has the ability to make me rather paranoid. I'm not sure why, but I just get a strange chill whenever I hear this! The bass is deep and pounding, as the beat bounces off the walls of your headphones and crashes into your brain. \\"Exchange\\" is probably the nearest you'll get to relative happiness on this album. The beat is rather soothing and relaxing, and there's a feeling of serenity about the whole four minutes of this instrumental. \\"Dissolved Girl\\" is one of my favourite songs from the album. It's also one of the catchiest songs on the album. It opens with a bass that will make your head spin due to the dizzy, repetitive nature of it. The vocals by the mysterious female work amazingly, bringing out a rather vulnerable and confused woman amongst the smothering darkness. \\"Man Next Door\\" opens brilliantly with a beat that sounds distant, with further-distant beats bouncing off from it. This is also one of my favourite songs from the album, because the story that is created is rather spooky, but with a humorous tone. The vocals seem a little unusual with a slight giggle in them, as the man sings of a strange men next door and of the things he gets up to.<br /><br />\\"Black Milk\\" has a distant intro before a static buzz filters in. This song sounds like the soundtrack to an alternative club in the middle of space, floating around. You could imagine this song being in an advert, as a man stares at a woman in a club, no speaking from anyone, only body language. The song has that edge to intimidate you, and I think you can't help but visualise a scenario if you close your eyes. The album's title track, \\"Mezzanine,\\" has a deep and pulsating throb that courses through the blood stream of this euphoric song. The darkness of this album is at its peak here, with whispered vocals and chattering beats clicking on and off in the background. The longest song on the album is \\"Group Four,\\" at over 8 minutes in length. This is a really great song that creeps into your ears with the stark contrast between whispered male vocals and angelic, sparse female vocals. The man mumbles effectively as the woman expresses herself so beautifully with an almost operatic vocal style. The album closes with \\"(Exchange)\\" which is a great outro track for this album. The job of this song, in my opinion, is to gently bring you back down to earth after the amazing high that the previous ten songs put you on. Something is needed to ground you safely, and this song is the perfect antidote. A beautiful end to an incredibly dark masterpiece.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This is by far the darkest album I own. This is not particularly true in lyrical content, but it is most definitely true in the case of the music you actually hear. Because this album is so profound, it has managed to almost create a genre for itself; think of visually dark music and this album will come out top nearly every time, I can guarantee it. The blend of trip-hop, electronica and dance is rather incredible, and something I am accustomed to being such a huge Bj&ouml;rk and Radiohead fan. Granted, this album isn't for everyone, and it took me these five months to truly appreciate everything on offer, but once you get into it you won't be able to stop listening. The darkness on this album is the temptation in your soul, and you will give in every time; you're putty in this album's hands.next door and of the things he gets up to.    \\"Black Milk\\" has a distant intro before a static buzz filters in.

B00005JLO2|5.0|Well. I don't really know where to begin. I guess it is to say that I thought this a very fine movie. Wes Bently (Durrance) is no Ralph Richardson and Heath Ledger is no Jon Clements. That seems to be the central criticism of this movie. Here's what I found to be quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Like Marvin Gaye's \\"Heard it on the Grapevine,\\" possibly the most recorded or 'covered' R&B tune, A.E.W. Mason's book over a 100 years ago has been made into movies seven times. I can't think of another book that has had that success. Why is that?<br /><br />Well. Because it's a wonderful story that asks questions that remain to this day unanswerable. Without sounding sexist, as long as women dress for the hunt and struggle to maintain what both genders safely call \\"allure,\\" men will question each other's courage. Whether you're in the third grade or in the Third Reich or in the Army Rangers or in the United States Marine Corps, the issue is going to come up.<br /><br />What makes the Four Feathers a great canvas for that issue is that the British are such easy targets. Nevertheless, it could have been written in Greek History with the 300 Spartans, Roman History with Horatio at the Bridge, and on and on. It's a fascinating issue. Can we be afraid? Are we all afraid and just some of us will it away? Are there those who are unafraid?<br /><br />So forget the statement that poor Harry ought not feel that way. We love this story and ALL the movies made about it because, like the reference to alluring dress above, the question is timeless.<br /><br />The other reason I like the movie is because it clearly allows Harry (Heath Ledger) to remove himself from the Commissioning scrolls in the absence of fraud or wilful bad behavior. In the past (and I believe in the Mason work itself) the script created an environment where Faversham receives the orders for himself and his three friends (Durrance, Willoughby, Burrows) and then hides them giving him time to resign. That's a different cup of tea, if you will. Here, Ledger just resigns, and makes no secret of the reason.<br /><br />Additionally, I liked Kate Hudson. She always reminded me of why they should prohibit nepotism in every profession, having gotten her job seemingly only because of her parentage and step-parentage. But she does a credible job as Ethene, and actually takes the role a step further by showing remorse and an acknowledgement of her hideous mistake, no doubt being the straw that breaks the camel's back so to speak, pushing Harry into the Sudan he so wanted to escape. Good acting job, Kate.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou did a wonderful job as Harry's protector once he actually makes it to the Sudan. An excellent actor who looks like the brick wall it's a good thing he wasn't around years earlier when they were casting for \\"Conan,\\" or there would be a different Governor of California.<br /><br />The tedious comparisons with the 1939 version are just that, tedious. The story in THIS version is still great. Ledger, Hudson, Bently and Hounsou do an above average job, the dialogue is excellent, and the photography is brilliant. The battle sequence of the British Square being filmed from above is the best I have ever seen. 1939 was 75 years ago. Yes, it was a brilliant film. It was still 75 years ago. Move on. 5 stars.

B00005JM0B|1.0|Why do I need to see the few hours before Skynet goes haywire? It's already been explained what happens. I don't need to see it damnit. Terminator 3 should have been set during the war. I want to see the freakin' war already. And none of this CGI nonsense. Cameron is the only director for Terminator. No new directors trying to take over. They just destroy good things. I don't need to hear about The Rock playing in T4. That only proves the series is going downhill. I just want to see the war, who wins, and how. I don't need to see a few hours before the bombs have been sent.
B00005JKNC|2.0|I'm so tired of Hollywood whining about the McCarthy era.  Most recently it was \\"The Contender\\"; before that, \\"The Crucible,\\"  and before *that,* \\"Guilty By Suspicion.\\"  They're like a dog with an old slipper it can't stop chewing.  As a somewhat mainstream sometimes-consumer of Hollywood's products, I have a message for Hollywood producers: No one cares about a bunch communists and their fellow travelers who lost their jobs in the 50s!<br /><br />The thirst for victim status manifests itself in far, far too many areas of American society as it is.  Hollywood producers, why don't you try to slake that thirst by telling each other at cocktail and coke parties that *you* would have stood in the breach and never given in to political pressure, if only you'd been lucky enough to have been accused.  Don't take your desire for victim status out on the rest of us. To paraphrase a famous McCarthy era Hollywood luminary: \\"Have you no shame?  The McCarthy era is dead!\\"
B00005JNVS|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is the best reviewed wide release film thus far this year, and there is a very good reason for that - it IS the best wide released movie thus far this year. <br /> <br />Better than that - Kung Fu Hustle is a Masterpiece of Cinema. <br /> <br />This film is brilliantly original and monstrously entertaining. I haven't heard a crowd respond like that in a comedy in ages. The movie has smart, sharp comedy with brilliant editing and timing, fantastic action scenes which really give you a sense of scale, power, and grace - in a way that Kill Bill could only dream of - and an artistic bent and ambition that actually works. The characters are funny and the performances are outstanding. <br /> <br />Stephen Chow is not only one of the world's greatest comedy actors, he is also one of the world's greatest comedy directors - actually, he's one of the world's greatest directors period. <br /> <br />Chow has created his own new style of comedy. Nobody else is doing anything remotely like what he does, and frankly, very few, if any, would be able to do it even if they wanted to. He uses the language of film and the techniques of visual storytelling in his comedy better than anybody. Rather than just locking down the camera and shooting the scenes flat, letting the actors do all the comedic heavy lifting, which is what you see in almost every comedy, Chow makes the camera an active participant in the comedy.  The visual language supports and enhances his comedy, and often becomes the very basis and essence of the comedic communication to the audience.  No other comedy director uses the camera so extensively.  Not even close. <br /> <br />Many scenes in this film can be compared to dance numbers, but in truth, the entire film is a \\"dance\\" of brilliant visual direction - I'd go so far as to say that Stephen Chow is a candidate for the title of our \\"visual Mozart.\\"  Turn the sound off and you can still tell exactly what is going on. <br /> <br />For instance, think about the section where the Assassins use their very interesting \\"musical weapon\\". I won't give anything away here, but in almost any other film, the deadliness of that weapon would've been revealed to the audience by the assassins demonstrating it - likely during a tense, quick scene where an unconvinced villain gets a \\"close call\\" when the assassins he's hiring show him just what their weapon can do.  The villain might be eating an apple, say, and the villains would strum their weapon, cutting the apple in half right before it reaches his mouth - a visual demonstration.  This would be a competent way to handle such a scene in a movie. <br /> <br />Chow doesn't go down that road, however - \\"competent\\" is not good enough for him - instead, we go straight into the scene not knowing what the weapon is or what it can do, and he gives us a gorgeous, slowly-building and musical demonstration of its power during its first deadly use... the mysterious night, the unlucky target noticing the musician plucking and tuning the instrument, the mood changing as things start to be \\"off\\", the notes being struck faster and with more intensity as branches fall around the target, and the shadow of an unlucky cat is sliced in two...  Finally, after this buildup, we get the \\"punchline\\" in a gorgeous but brutally unforgettable series of quick shots. <br /> <br />It's an amazing piece of visual storytelling, and it is not alone in this movie. Nearly every scene is infused with visual storytelling splendor. Chow uses cinematic language to tell a story in an interesting way better than any other director working today. <br /> <br />In a Stephen Chow-directed film, the filmmaking is as fun to watch as he is as an actor. Every single shot slides in and out of each other in a visually striking way, but they are not merely there just \\"to look cool\\" like we get from so many other directors today - the shots are visually striking for the purpose of using the camera to tell the story.  They accomplish a dramatic point that enhances the meaning of the scene and/or story. <br /> <br />I am a film director, and I am completely astonished by the way Chow works with the medium. I am firmly convinced that in the decades to come, like Buster Keaton before him, Chow's reputation in cinema will grow from \\"critically respected\\", like he is now, to \\"hailed as a film genius and pioneer\\". That's what happened to Buster Keaton, and it will happen to Stephen Chow. <br /> <br />Go see Kung Fu Hustle. And realize that you are watching a future film legend in the making while you're there. But whether you care about film history or not, you will certainly have a very fun time watching this movie. <br /> <br />Kung Fu Hustle is now the film to beat this year.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I am a huge Natalie Portman fan and I decided to give this flick a try, boy was I disappointed! <br /> <br />I understand that they are trying to be \\"artsy\\" in this film, but it just wasn't enjoyable to watch. I just didn't care about any of the characters in this movie. They are self absorbed cold hearted characters. Jude Law's character was just pathetic!  He is wimpering and whining throughout the whole movie. I was screaming at the screen \\"Get a backbone you wimp!\\"   <br /> <br />

B0007O38F8|3.0|The best way to describe this album is from a quote I got from another source, \\"50 Cent Got Rich and Stopped Tryin\\" In production terms, the album is excellent; compiled with beats from legendary producer Dr. Dre and his acomplice Eminem.  In lyrical terms, 50 massacred The Massacre.  There were some lines that were even used from his first album and the others were borrowed from other rap artist such as Biggie Smalls.  The lyrics that 50 did write on his own aren't going to be quoteable but just heard, nothing to giggle or say \\"Ohhhhhh\\" about.  There was one line in So Amazing that did catch my attention, \\"I wanna get in you, opps I mean I'm into you.\\"  That's about the funniest 50 will get.  His serious songs dosn't sound like he was serious when he wrote it.  This album had me disappointed especially due to the fact that 50 had dropped some hot lines in other songs like \\"Hate it or Love It\\" and Eminem's \\"Spend Some Time.\\"  One of the only things that didn't stop this boat from sinking is the endless radio hits. Somehow, you can almost release any 50 Cent song and it'll always be #1 on the charts.  These are songs that'll catch your ear cause 50's voice just blends perfect with the beats. Overall 2.5 out of 5      Great Tracks: Lil' Bit, Get In My Car, I'm Suppose to Die Tonight    Should you pick this album up, only if you have spare change.  There are alot of other alternatives that are much better than this.
B00005K9LK|5.0|As my title says, this was the first Judas Priest album I got. This album is DEFINITELY one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time. This album contains Rob Halford's signature shreaking, killer twin attack guitar solos from Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing, great basslines from Ian Hill, and great drummnig from Dave Holland (even tough I think Scott Travis is a better drummer, he's still a great drummer). If you're new to Judas Priest this is the perfect place to start. This was mine first one and it got me started in the right direction. The album starts with the signature \\"The Hellion/Electric Eye\\" that is palyed live nowadays. I love the chorus, \\"I'm elected electric spy/I'm protecting electric eye\\". My absolute favorite song on this album, and favorite Priest song in general, is the classic \\"You Got Another Thing Comin'\\". Remember when I said Judas Priest was my favorite band? this is my favorite song by them, making it my favorite song of all time! Anyway, this is a metal classic, and has made history. If you liek metal this is a must have masterpiece!<br /><br />Ratings: (since I don't have the version Amazon sells, this apllies to the original version, the one I have)<br /><br />1.

B00006F7S4|5.0|A website told me that the two best albums realeased in the year 2002 were Royksopp's \\"Melody A.M\\" and Beck's \\"Sea Change\\". My favourite song in the album which alone certifies the album 3 stars on its own is \\"Lost Cause\\" I think \\"Golden Age\\" is a classic. \\"Lonesome Tears\\" is on a whiny sorrowful Beck,not bad either but I wouldn't ask my best friend to give it a listen.\\"Already Dead\\" and \\"Round The Bend\\" help create a stronghold on the vocal driven melody and vice versa.\\"Paper Tiger\\" is a great song which follows up \\"The Golden Age\\"<br /><br />There's nothing to say that hasn't already been said. Purchase this album without blinking an eye lid. Good album cover. Strong Tracks. Beck's Best album? Well, it's the only one I purchased. Not a big fan of \\"Guerro\\" with its happy feel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm sad to say that I didn't discover this show until after it had been canceled, and the show is so good, I feel guilty for that fact. Fine writing, acting. Original, yet, not at all. You don't know whats coming but it has the familiarity of your favorite pair of shoes. I can only hope the feature film is a huge success because I want to see the adventures of Serenity and it's crew for years to come.
B00008977N|4.0|First off...when I bought the tape many moons ago I was absolutely in love with it for a very long time.  I recognized it as a \\"live\\" concert film...one where a great deal of effort had been made to create a means of escape into Peter's \\"secret world\\".  I had seen another version on t.v. and immediately saw the difference -the t.v. one was straight tape for a more concert feel, while my VHS version was obviously very carefully worked over to create a movie like experience (does this make any sense to anyone).  Anyway, it worked wonderfully for me and the DVD I bought is the same version.  I played the two formats simultaneously tonite and flipped back and forth to see the difference both sonically and visually. I played the DVD first and did recognize the grainy issue for many in previous reviews however the tape was far worse!!  I think the bottom line is that they put this down on film for effect and this isn't exactly a bright concert so just sit back and enjoy the color changes and \\"mood\\" shifts.  As for sound...the tape wins! (I never would have guessed).  It is much richer, deeper, brighter.  All in all, however I think we all adjust to whatever we have so I don't think anyone would be too disappointed in buying what I believe is a truly wondrous music experience (in whatever form).
B0000BYM3K|5.0|In 2003, the Brave New World lineup of Bruce Dickinson Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, Janick Gers, Steve Harris, and Nicko McBain release one of Iron Maiden's best albums in years. I don't see why all the die-hard IM fans are bashing this all of a sudden. Someone said this album had terrible production. Seriously, if you think this album has terrible production, go buy \\"Reek of Putrefaction\\" by Carcass, a good grind album that has atrocious production, Jeff Walker (vocalist/bassist for Carcass) sounds like he recored his vocals while taking a crap. Another person said that this is their worst album. If you think this is IM's worst album, go buy X Factor. Enough about the comparisions, on to this record. As my title says, this is the best album released in 2003. This was also the first Iron Maiden album I've actually owned (I've had downloaded songs burnt to CD-R's, but this is the first official full-length album I got by them). The album is kick-started with a 1-2-3-4 intro in \\"Wildest Dreams\\", the albums first single. This is one of my favorite songs on the album. The chorus gets tuck in my head almost all the time! The next song, \\"Rainmaker\\", the album's second single, is EASILY the best song on the album. It's basiclly a song that you have to listen to understand how amazing it is. Another great song is \\"Montsigur\\", which is one of the heavier songs on this album. Other great songs include No More Lies and the title track. All the songs here rock, but the above mentioned songs are my favorites. If you want a very good album in general, buy his album. This is recommended for fans of metal, Iron Maiden, and just good music in general.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1. Wildest Dreams 5/5<br /><br />2. Rainmaker 5/5<br /><br />3.

0393307050|5.0|After going to see the movie (twice, and tonight will be the third), and spending this fall sailing around the Potomac river, I had to buy this book to complete the picture. I was not disapointed - this book was amazing. However, I did have to shift gears a bit in order to better enjoy it. At no time was I without a dictionary, and a big thick one with lots of old archaic words in it, and even then, certain words and phrases managed to elude my best efforts to decipher. Nevertheless, I approached this book the way I approach Science Fiction, which is to say that though I don't know exactly how a Tri-beta Implosion Drive works, I nevertheless trust that it does work and keep reading. The following is a list of good and bad points to the book (and the good far out-weigh the bad, if you ask me).<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />1) The historical accuracy, or what I'd like to believe is accurate, is incredible. I learned more about naval life, 19th century life, the scientific mindset and the origin of words in this one book than in all the hundreds of other books I've ever read. Admittedly, this is only my second \\"historical\\" novel, the first being The Alienist by Calib Carr (excellent book too!).<br /><br />2) The action, the battles! The Strategery! This was amazing, and finely captured by the movie.<br /><br />3) The \\"feel\\": I loved the feeling I got when he got his boat, how he walked around looking for ways to improve it, the need to test it out and \\"see what this baby can do\\". I loved the creaking of the timbers and the groan of yardarms under sail, the smell of gunpowerder and slow matches, and most importantly, the smell of blood, the hunt and the triumph of the kill. And yeah, I did feel a little guilty about wanting those other boats to get shot up, knowing that people were going to die - not to mention silly for feeling this way about a book. Realialistic, eh?<br /><br />4) Another thing I liked was the way the men looked up to Jack and Stephen for their amazing luck and skill, respectively. It was kind of interesting to see how a person becomes a master of men. Dammit, this book was just plain interesting altogether.<br /><br />5) A lot of reviewers deride the book because it doesn't seem to have a plot - I say good riddence! This book doesn't need a plot - or rather, the whole book is the plot, and they can't see the forest for the trees. All Jack Aubrey does is cruise around the French/Spanish Coast looking for trouble, and I'm oh-so-fine with that. There's also a lot of getting to know the characters going on, and that'll be important for the next nineteen books.<br /><br />BAD POINTS:<br /><br />1) One thing I didn't like was the unexpected jumps in time. One minute Jack is eating dinner, the next he's 200 miles away in Malta - or worse, heading BACK from Malta, having finished whatever he was doing.<br /><br />2) I'm a big fan of the archaic words and terms, however, when the plot is about to twist in an important direction or there's a necessary transition that the audience really should be aware of, I really wish Patrick O'Brien would forgive my American Public School education for just a paragraph or two so that I could catch on to what he's trying to convey. The good news is, I've either caught up with his style or he's dumbed Post Captain, the next book, down since writing the first. It reads a whole lot easier, and I'm still expanding my vocabulary a bit - but I'll save that for my next review.<br /><br />3) The book ended - that was kind of a bummer.spectively.

0385508417|2.0|This hard mechanical tale has none of the warmth of a traditional Christmas story. It almost makes me wish for the generic Christmas clich&eacute;s. When the Kranks decide to skip Christmas, the retribution for their lack of conformity makes up 90% of the book.<br /><br />The story is set on a street called Hemlock, which is an accurate moniker for the poison people that live there. This horribly intrusive community is reminiscent of Stalinesque Russian with neighbors spying on each other and even reporting each other to the police when they get out of line. It's supposed to be done for comedic effect, but instead comes across as mirthless suburban tyranny.<br /><br />The Shields through most of the book are symptomatic of the festering evil of the neighborhood. The re-appearance of breast cancer in the Shields family is used as an obvious \\"heart-string pulling\\" device to evoke the holiday's \\"good will toward men\\" which is missing from the rest of the narrative.<br /><br />In the warm and fuzzy conclusion, the neighborhood pitches in to save Christmas for the Kranks. You can almost hear the neighbors tallying their markers and preparing their told-you-so comments for the coming year. Luther Krank gives a gift to a neighbor and says \\"no string attached.\\" He'd best keep his own marker for the gift since the strings of all the neighbors are being weaved around him and his wife.<br /><br />The moral lesson of the book appears to be: conform and everyone will like you - but resist and you will be punished relentlessly. What a nice holiday message.
B0007GAERG|2.0|I love old mimi for all the wrong reasons. But now gone are the mad woman outbursts, self indulgent diva lyrics and disturbing vocal acrobatics; and i have to say its quite dull as a result. <br /> <br />'mimi' has some worthwhile tracks. 'its like that' is her best single for years with its spacial beats & electronica building to a heavy hip-hop crescendo with a fabulous rant from fatman scoop.  <br />The Neptunes do wonders with Snoop Dog on 'say something' designing a slice of slick urban funk.  <br />Kanye West brings his usual retro flavoured magic with a gorgeous 70's Motown-style cut 'Stay the night' and against my expectations Twista & mariah excel on the awesome 'one and only' with a killer down beat and blues gitaur loop.  <br /> <br />But thats it kids, the rest is just dull. Shes much better when shes on the cutting edge; when she resorts to soft, sweet and midly soulful (i.e. we belong together, break it off...etc) its mind numbing. <br /> <br />Vocally she's on decent form but its all rather uninspiring.  the best thing about 'mimi' is the legendary production crew and the fact she seems to have spat out the thesaurus she swallowed some time around 'rainbow'.  <br /> <br />It may age very well. who knows. but in my opinion its music by focus group. you can feel the record companies influence in the track selection and choice of contributors. its a contrived affair, designed to get her away from the mental paranoid diva persona, to the cool urban hip-hop chick kids can relate to.  <br />it will probably work but shes lost something in the process and has created an album of finely tuned, over polished, elevator beats. <br />
B00004TH6O|5.0|I have to admit, I found out about Queens of the Stone Age after Songs for the Deaf was released so I naturally went for the latest release. With the new album coming up (review coming soon!), I decided to go back to Queens' Rated R album. While different from Songs for the Deaf, this album still has the epic nature of its successor. <br /> <br /> The album starts off with \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" with pulsating bass and drums and crunchy guitars that are the background of Homme's voice repeating intoxicants. The occasional guitar solos and background voices make this song one of the best Queens songs; a good way to start the album. <br /> <br /> Next comes \\"Lost Art of Keeping a Secret.\\" With a more mysterious yet upbeat tone, this song is very catchy. Homme's souring voice flouts over Oliveri's jumpy riffs. With the crunchy distorted guitars in the chorus makes this song great and original. <br /> <br /> \\"Leg of Lamb\\" comes with a repeated guitar riff that changes during the chorus. Overall, a decent song but not able to compete with the first two hits. <br /> <br /> \\"Auto Pilot\\" has souring (pardon the pun) guitars and Oliveri's voice is calm and soothing. A relaxing rock song. Some would consider it a first. Great song that's very catchy. <br /> <br /> \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" is back to mysterious guitar riffs. Homme smooth singing tells some stuff that seems like Matrix movie references in the lyrics. With occasional pauses, humming voices, and guitar solos keep you on your feet and enables to pay attention to the whole song. A great song and matches it up with the first two songs to become a hit. <br /> <br /> \\"Monsters in the Parasol\\" starts off promising with a crunchy guitar riff and upbeat drums. However, the guitar and Homme's voice in the chorus crashes and burns and sounds like music that would be on the background of a circus. <br /> <br /> \\"Quick and to the Pointless\\" is exactly what the title says. It's a Oliveri scream session. There's some German (?) in the lyrics that makes is slightly more interesting. The kids' screaming \\"Yeah yeah yeah yeah\\" and the guitar riffs are catchy and you can't help but randomly start singing the song in conversations. <br /> <br /> \\"In The Fade\\" begins to start like another mysterious song but turns out to be...should I say...happy? The bass and guitar riffs seem one that would be used a mainstream love song. The most mainstream-like on this album, its not bad and its catchy but it doesn't seem like the same Queens. However, at the very end it seems that the band felt nostalgic and gave us about a 30 second clip of \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" which gives off a meaning to their audience: Don't do drugs, kids!! <br /> <br /> \\"Tension Head\\" gives a mainstream-like guitar riff that accompanies another Oliveri scream session. Like \\"Quick\\" its still a good song and fits into the flow of the CD. <br />As if to make up for the loud guitar riffs that blow off your ears, \\"Lightning Song\\" is an instrumental song that has a piano, soothing acoustic guitars, and a nice beat that makes you think of hot girls on the beach. Great song! It's going on my calm music playlist. <br /> <br /> To go out with a bang \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\" sounds like \\"Better Living\\" but with a slightly syncopated beat in the beginning and Homme's voice is not filtered. This over-eight-minute-long epic is a great way to end the song. Curiosly enough, it even has a brass section to the song where trumpets and French horns take on the guitar riff. Along with that is a trumpet solo in which you can't help but smile. <br /> <br /> Better than Song for the Deaf? Hard to say. Less poppy and more pure rock, \\"R\\" is one of the best albums around. How do they do it? I guess it doesn't matter, as long as they keep doing it. So I highly suggest this CD. Well that's the end of the review. And remember kids, don't do drugs.
0553381407|5.0|If sometimes you find yourself feeling depressed or angry for no apparent reason- there may be a reason. <br />When this happened to me I did everything from self-help books, to meditation techniques, to partying, to listening to music, to rolling up into a ball and laying there- all to no avail. Then one day during one of these moods I decided to try reading something yet again to get my mind off the out of the blue sadness- after reading only the first couple of chapters, something finally clicked in me, and I really knew for the first time what these episodes were about. For the first time ever I actually felt the healing process begin within me and could start taking charge of how I felt.  I can't say enough about the excersises in this book!  The last few chapters are especially helpful.  When you feel up to it, you may want to take out your highlighter because there are some real gems in this text that you'll want to read and re-read for years to come.
1400031524|3.0|After mostly enjoying the first in the Kurt Wallander series (Faceless Killers), I definitely found this one to be a significant step down in quality. Set in 1991, it starts off promisingly enough with a pair of smugglers discovering two dead men adrift in a life raft. The good samaritan criminals tow the raft closer to the Swedish shore, where it winds up washing up in Inspector Wallander's territory. For a while, the story proceeds as a straight crime procedural, as he attempts to find out who the men are and why they were killed. As usual, in the background is Wallander's shaky personal life and his coping with the death of his closest friend on the police force.<br /><br />However, once it's determined that the men are from Eastern Europe, the story morphs into an international thriller. First, Major Liepa of the Latvian police arrives to try and assist on the case. Then, Wallander is himself dispatched to Latvia to help with a related murder there. Rather improbably, Wallander simply steps off the plane and is whisked away by his Latvian police liaisons. At the time, one would think the Swedish Embassy would have someone on hand make sure all went smoothly. However, this would make it harder to develop the plot, which revolves around Wallander's confusion over the forces at work and the Latvian police he's working with. Soon, the book is awash with amateur spycraft, as Wallander goes to clandestine meets with mysterious figures. Next thing you know, the dour detective has launched himself headfirst into a ridiculous scheme involving illegal border crossings, false papers, car theft, and wild shootouts. Even worse, these over the top Mission Impossible style theatrics are due to his infatuation with a woman he's only briefly met. If all of this smacks of a bad Hollywood film rather than a solid crime novel, that's unfortunately how it reads as well.<br /><br />At the time of the book's writing, the Soviet Union was still in the midst of dissolution and reformers and hardliners in the USSR's various satellite republics were struggling to determine the future of their new states. Through Wallander, Mankell attempts to contrast orderly, progressive, first-world Sweden with chaotic, repressive, third-world Latvia. Alas, the city never really comes to life, and the atmosphere feels ersatz. Mankell attempts to make a connection between organized crime and the political power structure of the emerging post-Soviet states, but it kind of falls flat. It doesn't help that the characterization isn't particularly good, even for critical characters such as Wallander's platonic love interest. Like the first book, the writing is fairly straightforward and plain. One rather severe misstep involves the Latvian Major and Wallander, who are both described as having very shaky English, and yet their conversations are rendered in more or less grammatically sound, highly idiomatic English.<br /><br />Note: The book was made into a film for Swedish television in 1995 which is apparently unavailable in English.mers and hardliners in the USSR's various satellite republics were struggling to determine the future of their new states.

B00001U0CP|5.0|The life story of Kay Scarpetta continues, and if it weren't so fascinating the reader would have been bored with this character books ago! Scarpetta is a fictional person we can sometimes relate to and other times we're just in awe of her intelligence and fortitude.<br /><br />In UNNATURAL EXPOSURE, Kay Scarpetta is after a serial killer who plants mutilated bodies to throw those less intellectual off the trail. Scarpetta is led through the scary world of mutant smallpox and the spreading of this disease through common commodities and free offers. Has your imagination ever wondered about that free sample you received in the mail - what if...? Not only does Dr. Kay have to try and figure all of this out; she must piece together the clues left for her in an AOL chat room. (Gee, wonder how much AOL paid Cornwell for the advertising).<br /><br />This book contains the type of story and characters that has made Patricia Cornwell one of the best mystery writers today. She points your imagination in a certain direction and then nourishes it so it can run wild. She mixes enough speculation with real life that as I read, I wondered what was fiction and what was factual. I'm definitely going to have to look into that DataGlove and VPL Eyephone that Lucy gives Kay Scarpetta to take a virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene. That is definitely intriguing, but is it something of today or of the future?<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Cornwell's books, or if you somehow missed this one in the Scarpetta series, grab the first copy you see. I'll bet you won't be able to put it down (just like me)!
0792833201|5.0|Here we go.  This is the story that gave me my life-long fear of clowns and creepy-looking trees with faces, when I was misguided enough to prove myself a \\"big boy\\" to my older sister oh so long ago.  She got me good with this one.    Widely regarded as one of the most troubled, cursed, and overwrought productions in the history of Hollywood, \\"Poltergeist\\" was -- in a way -- Steven Spielberg's swan song to being a legitimate horror director.  Extreme fans of this film often wonder when a Special Edition of the movie will make it to DVD, with loads of tasty extras, deleted scenes, and making-of documentaries.  Answer: probably never.  I know it ain't gonna happen anytime soon.  Too much controversy and on-set secrets that wish never to be brought to public light.    The film itself: steadfast competition for Spielberg's other venture that same summer of '82 -- \\"E.T.\\"  I think we all know which got the more attention.  In the Editorial Review is an interesting hypothesis abut how the two films might reflect polar opposite memories for Spielberg in suburbia.  Nice idea, it could have some truth.  But I like to think of Spielberg's \\"Poltergeist\\" script as the final dissertation to a horrendous bout of private paranormal research.  (The antithesis to this may be \\"Always\\".)  Alright, let's climb the rollercoaster...    The Freeling Family (name importance: the culture of Steven and Diane's past: the hippies; and how they become prisoners in their own home) wakes up late one night to the littlest daughter Carol Ann speaking into the television static of a disconnected station.  Seconds before, while \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" bellows the last commercial of the night, the camera lens is literally up against the TV monitor, close enough to trace every pixel, inviting us to look THROUGH THEM...  Nothing too serious to start.      Several unrelated instances succeed that, most of them sort of humorous (silverware bends on its own, a milk glass shatters, the pet bird dies, etc.).  But the strange things begin to grow in frequency and in power (levitating chairs, Carol Ann makes mention of \\"the TV people\\") until the spirits from the television flat-out invade the house -- shaking it to its very foundation -- and abducting Carol Ann into a netherworld portal placed in the child's closet.  They're tricky bastards, too.  Not above creating a fatal diversion.    Obviously unable to cope with something so fantastic on their own, the family solicits the help of University Paranormal Researchers (Dr. Lesh, Bryan, Marty) to not investigate the spirits in their house -- but to find a way through them to get Carol Ann back.  They don't care about the haunting (they do, but...), but their little girl is SOMEWHERE inside the house.  I swear, if anyone wants a reference subject on how to be not just great but IDEAL parents... emulate the Freelings.  I would show this film in a child-rearing class in a heartbeat.    Real helps seems to arrive with a rather potent clairvoyant, Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein), who maps out and enacts a cross-plane rescue mission to pull Carol Ann back to this Earth, and thereby \\"cleaning\\" the house of demonic infestation... or so they think...  Spielberg literally breaks Hell out of the ground in the final 15 minutes: an effects free-for-all that launches carcasses at the family as they scramble madcap for the open road, culminating in a hair-raising, spine-shivering implosion big enough to swallow the house.    If this is not Spielberg's most cohesive script, it is assuredly one of his smartest.  The consistencies in research I've done on my own are (unintended pun) dead-on (cold spots, peripheral motion, globules, loud growls and bangs, etc.).  But I just adore Tangina's monologue about the nature of \\"death\\" and the subsequent facts of WHY the spirits have taken the girl: there is an implicit purpose.  (A chief detail just skimmed over in dialogue is that Carol Ann was born INSIDE the house, thereby amplifying her lifeforceto the restless spirits that occupy the ground beneath them.)  In the writing... was Spielberg trying to create the coolest set of parents in the world, or what?  Even if he wasn't trying to, I think he pretty much did.  Oh, who cares if they smoke joints before bed?  That makes them all the more relatable to me, because, though they are bonafide family people, Steven and Diane are still hippies at heart.  They're all too human... facing a truly inhuman adversary.    Jobeth Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Diane Freeling and she was robbed.  This is fact.  Want proof?  Observe the extended reaction shot Tobe Hooper (this is what the man's famous for) puts on her during Tangina's monologue mentioned above.  That look on her face represents PRIMAL, HELPLESS FEAR (not seen since the original \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" back in '74) strong enough to freeze the very tears on her cheeks.  Her entire embodiment of Diane Freeling is acting of a transcendant caliber.    Future Oscar-winner Stephen Hunter Flick's sound design will shake your bones.  The dead silence in the house, Diane working up some nerve, to look insi-- A HURRICANE SCREAMS AND RAGES INSIDE THE ROOM--!!  Hoo, boy.    \\"Poltergeist\\" (a German word translated as \\"knocking ghost\\") is one of those rare entertainments that goes beyond its category.  Sure, look at the front box, and you'll slide it into the Horror section.  But this film's heart, what this ghost story is *about*... is the impossible lengths good parents will go to to protect their children.  (Upon Diane's first face-to-face encounter with The Beast: \\"NOOO!!  DON'T YOU TOUCH MY BABIES!!\\")  Diane breaches the afterlife for her daughter without so much as a backwards glance.     A genuine and deserved staple in the \\"American Horror\\" canon, \\"Poltergeist\\" is a madhouse frightfest, a wrenching family drama... and just one helluva good time at the movies.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Some people may have been thinking that this was supposed to be a serious horror genre film, and that it actually came off as a little bubblegummy.  I think that was what the movie about, more a fun, playful way of integrating these characters.  While Stephen Sommers did forego any gore or gruesome horror (or realism: Kate Beckinsale gets thrown fifty feet a hundred times and she lands on her feet every time), he did bring together a plot that is fun.  The plot was coherent (made sense), and aside from some occasional goofy parts (like Kate's invincibility), was presentable.  Sommers managed to write something that had a need and motive for all its characters, and that was the magic of the movie.  The plot wasn't so much ingenious at face value as it was clever when you think about all the work that went into a fairly simple plot to get it out there.         This movie had everything you could want visually (heh).  While Dracula's brides were eyecandy with bad accents, the werewolves (my favorite mythological creature) and the Dracula Beast (a good point of originality here) were AWESOME (not to mention Mr. Hyde, who is my monster man although he was [purposefully?] CGI-looking).  The sets and scenery was enormous and breathtaking, \\"Sommers-sizing\\".  Probably the best sets (at least in creating a world) I've ever seen and has ever been.  The overall look and feel was the movie's strongest point.         Hugh Jackman was, I guess, adequate as Van Helsing (he didn't have much to do).  Kate Beckinsale was, shall we say, audibly hilarious, but I think she was a good character.  Velkan was done well by Will Kemp.  Now we're onto vampires, my most and least favorite characters contained in this sphere.  Dracula's brides were just a bunch of cleavage, and parents will probably want to think about whether to let their children see this movie on that note.  The head vampire, none other than Count Vladislus Dracula, was so cool.  Richard Roxborough (I can't spell his last name! I think) as Dracula come off as the only truly creepy character in the whole thing.  Quite a performance, in my humble opinion, and definitely the best acting job of the movie.        Other than the enormous amount of cleavage and sensuality (normal vampire fare), Van Helsing is okay for kids.  Not any blood or anything particularly scary in terms of graphic detail  or violence.         Overall, I would buy this movie (if I was allowed to) because it is thoroughly enjoyable and worth watching over and over again.  Worth a rental to see what you think! Good movie!
B00005JMUA|5.0|I LOVE THE ACTION AND SUSPENSE IN THIS MOVIE, I DIDN'T EVEN SEE VOLUME 1. THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE MY FAVOURITE OF ALL TIME. UMA THURMAN SHOULD HAVE GOT AN OSCAR FOR THIS ROLE, AGAIN THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME. YOU GOTTA HAND IT TO MR. TARANTINO HE SURE KNOWS HOW TO CREATE A GOOD MOVIE. PLEASE WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE.
B00004U2G4|4.0|My friends and I heard about this Brit blues/rock group in 1968 while we were in college. Jeff Beck had been in the Yardbirds, who we loved along with the Stones, and we had all been amazed by the Antonioni flick \\"BLOWUP\\", which featured a great sequence in a club with the Yardbirds (Beck and Page) doing \\"Stroll On/Train Kept A-Rollin\\". The movie had David Hemmings, who we thought had the coolest set-up imaginable: great car, great job, all kinds of girls, fantastic flat, everything. (My, how we get on in years so quickly! David Hemmings recently died, looking a helluva lot more bloated and aged than he did in \\"BLOW UP\\".)  <br /> <br />We loved blues. Truth came out in 1968. It blew us all away. The great thing about it was it became a transcendental experience, a bridge between our white 1960's consciousness and the black 1930's/40's/50's blues thing. We would never have gotten into Muddy Waters and Howling Wolf had we not heard the Stones, Beck, Clapton and Page first. <br /> <br />And there was the fascination with the whole British thing also. Loved the accents, the names, the films, the bands (all the ones I mentioned, plus The Kinks, The Animals, The Who, Savoy Brown, Chicken Shack, Brian Auger, Jethro Tull, Aynsley Dunbar, Robin Trower, The Groundhogs, Ten Years After, Rory Gallagher, etc..Not ALL blues, but many are). We ate up the Ian Fleming James Bond books and films. We devoured the whole Clockwork Orange thing when it came out, and a bit later, Quadrophenia, and even got heavily into soccer: Arsenal, especially, and Tottenham Hotspur, West Bromwich Albion, Ipswich Town, Queen's Park Rangers, Crystal Palace: these were totally fascinating to us.  <br /> <br />Won't go into much into the album specifics here, because it would take too long. This was back in the days when they would release both a monaural and a stereo version, or at least the Stones' London disks were always handled that way. We wore this sucker out, playing it constantly. What a great blues singer was Stewart, with those raspy, booze-sodden vocals. Beck's Bolero? Still one of Jeff's greatest achievements. This whole thing holds up very, very well. Stewart slow blues: \\"I don't know too much about love, people,......but I sure think I got it bad\\".....LISTEN!!\\" <br /> <br />\\"You can ROCK me, like my back it ain't got no bone\\".  <br /> <br />You Shook Me. Driven by Beck, who absolutely assaults the strings. Ronnie Wood on bass, Mick Waller on drums. Pick your poison; anyone of 'em will do it.  <br /> <br />The group appeared in what, early 1969 in Minneapolis at a place called The Labor Temple, and we didn't miss it. Anyone remember that one, or were you there? Lotta hair in those days. Stewart's PA system was not cooperating, and he got frustrated as hell. Still, a great show. At one point, Beck asked us, \\"Does anyone out there like blues?\\". I thought for a minute he was going to explain it to us.  <br /> <br />We thought they looked pretty cool as well, with the hair and clothes and such. Real show people, exotic-looking, so unlike the jeans/hippie college thing.  <br /> <br />Beck has the same hairstyle today that he had in 1966. But so what? I think it's great. And he's still playing great music. I see he was on the Scorsese blues series doing a slow blues with--Tom Jones??!?! Are you kidding me? You know what though? It rocked. Glad to see these old geezers still able to get it on.  <br /> <br />Funny thing is I bought this album for my 18-yr. old son, who likes it. Thus, the tradition lives on.
0451147960|1.0|I recently read the Modigiliani Scandal. I think this is the worst Follett I have ever read (and I have read quite a few). There are many weaknesses in the plot- first of all the ease with which art experts can be fooled seems too far fetched. Secondly the lack of a solid central character. Also by the end you get a feeling of being cheated as it seems what you have just finished was not a Follett at all. I do not recommend the book to any Follett lover
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Well maybe not 100 - but I got the CD on Thursday - listened in the car, then at home all night, then all day Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  I cant get enough.  I am in my late 20's with an old soul - and I love this era in music.  Thinking of even using You and I as my wedding song - or one of them.  It is great.  The song 'Home' is so moving...has such a great sound.  'Quando, Quando, Quando' with Nelli Furtado is to die for.  If you like this kind of 'big band' music - get it!!!!
B00005JMUA|4.0|Remember (if you're over 22 or so, I guess) when there were no CDs and no burning CD programmes, so you'd make somebody a mixed tape? (see the movie \\"High Fidelity\\" for a better explanation_ they have it here at amazon) <br />Well, all of Tarantino's movies, specially this last Kill Bill, ARE mixed tapes. And I'm not talking about the soundtrack.  <br />It's interesting how even the first Kill Bill gets a track or two in this one... <br />And, by the way, both Kill Bills are KILLER tapes. The type you need a lot of inspiration to pull. The only reason I gave Kill Bill vol.2 four stars and not five is the Emilio thing (go see the movie). Twisted! What was the scriptwriter trying to do (errr... just remembered that'd be Tarantino, too), get us to hate her?  <br />All hands up for no one under 10 in the next Tarantino movie. <br />
B0001L3MI0|3.0|...this is far from being a favorite of mine it still has its' moments. I've bought it, the sound and picture (still today) is very good indeed, and the effects -well, some still stunning, some not! Like one of the many explotions, the one in that tunnel with the dog managing to save its' own life in the nick of time, that was not so good. <br /> <br />Actually the biggest problem is the man supposed to be the star of \\"Independence day\\". Yes, Will Smith! I wonder if he maybe thinks he is a \\"bit\\" cooler than the rest of the planet thinks. He has fans of course, but I remember being embarrased by him overacting already in the \\"Fresh Prince\\"-series. He is painful to watch in \\"I.d\\". I know of course he didn't write the script nor his own lines, but Will Smith becomes a parody on himself in the movie. And I don't know how many times during the movie I wanted to tell him to \\"Shut up!\\". I mean hitting the alien on its' way out of the spaceship; \\"Welcome to earth! Now that's what I'd call a close encounter!\\" There are plenty of those.  <br /> <br />Other than that, and the \\"America save us all!\\"-patriotism, well as mentioned -\\"Independence day\\" has its' moments and highlights, and some remembarable scenes. What I'm trying to say is that some of the story here also functions, it's not all effects. <br /> <br />They say that the biggest Sci-fi-movie ever is the classic \\"War of the Worlds\\", not that I agree on that, but that movie probably was what \\"Independence day\\" was when it was released in the theatres back in the mid-90's. Because despite the critics, \\"I.d\\" was a big hit when it came -so all in all, a sci-fi-fan might enjoy this even though I find no excuse for Will Smiths' overcool-part!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I just reviewed Kill Bill vol.2, claiming all Tarantino's movies are mixed tapes (high school, good looking guy_or girl_you were trying to impress). Only Tarantino does not, like many of us, fail in his attempts to put Deep Purple and Abba together in a sequence: he produces The Tape From Heaven. That is, if you like gore, hot chicks, sword fights, emotional climaxes and suspense. In other words... if you are a hormone-drenched teenage boy. Or, yet in another words, if you are an adult who happens to have \\"unfinished bussinnes\\" with your own adolescence.  <br />In either case, rest assured: this movie will wash your angered soul.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|Bland, repetitive (to a fault), predictable, underdeveloped, uncreative, under-produced, horrible-sounding synthed out guitars in nearly every single song, static drum beats (for the most part).  That pretty much sums up Human After All <br /> <br />Songs to Avoid at All Costs: <br />-Primetime of Your Life <br />-Steam Machine <br />-Make Love <br />-Television Rules the Nation (Easily the worst song on the album, and it happens to have the worst title on the album as well.) <br />-Emotion <br />-(Basically most of the album) <br /> <br />Enjoy. <br /> <br />PS - I'm think of starting a petition to make Daft Punk put away those annoying guitars, or at least to get rid of that grainy synth-guitar effect that plagues this album.
B0000024JN|5.0|At it's time of release in 1986 the blend of rock/rap/hip-hop was the greatest combination for the production found on Licensed To Ill.  Not only was this the Beastie Boys debut, it was a breakthrough for rap being this was some white boys doing it.  \\"...the three bad brothers we know so well...\\" had everything covered from hardcore, party, comedy into this 13 track release.  Production was done by co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, Rick Rubin.  Getting help from all angles, Run-DMC wrote \\"Slow And Low\\" and also co-wrote with the Boys the classic, ever so sampled \\"Paul Revere\\".  Beastie Boys often flowed in and out well to give us each a part of their personality that still hasn't been duplicated by a rap group to date.  All tracks were basically singles, with no fillers, interludes or featured guests.
1400049628|5.0|I read this book thinking, \\"Yeah right!\\"  But throughout this book Max Brooks brings up logical analysis of why zombies could not only exist (the feasbility of a virus attacking the brain as-to render the person a zombie) but also supports this theory with detailed historical evidence that (if researched) only confounds the reader, because the historical documents are all vague ACTUAL disappearances of people, small villages, and sometimes ENTIRE TOWNS and communities.  A very interesting yet vaguely disturbing book.<br /><br />If you're a fan of zombie thriller or just think they're funny, then READ THIS BOOK! (GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY! lol)  This books is a 'REAL' survival guide pertaining to what to do if a zombie outbreak were to take place nearby where you live, how to detect a zombie outbreak (what to look for), what to do if you believe an outbreak is occuring, where to go away from an outbreak, and how to determine which classification the zombie outbreak has reached.  Class 1 - 4, 1 being a few zombies roaming and 4 being  a local city completely consumed and zombies spreading in all directions (for anyone whose seen a zombie movie, we all know dispersion of zombies is BIG trouble).
B0007XT87G|5.0|\\"Deadwing\\" is another remarkable achievement for Steve Wilson and PTree. It is more polished and advanced than the incredible \\"In Abstentia\\". Like all PTree albums, this one needs to be played through again and again to uncover the beautiful undertones and subtle layers of vocals, bass, drums and guitars and the thematic keyboard treatments by Richard Barbieri. It is time to stop comparing this great band to others.     Deadwing is very rich in its rewards.  The heavier songs take you to undreamed of places.  \\"Halo\\" just knocks me over.  \\"Arriving Somewhere...\\"  may be the best 12 minutes of progressive rock music ever.  \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" and \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" and \\"Lazarus\\" are stunningly beautiful. The guest appearances by Adrian Belew and particularly Mike Akerfeldt from Opeth work incredibly well. Akerfeldt's vocals and gorgeous guitar work on \\"Arriving...\\" are perfect.    Steve Wilson's genius in creating beautiful, jarring and exquisite music cannot be overstated.  The production, song writing, music and vocals on \\"Deadwing\\" are stunning. Upon many listenings already, it is clear that the album is the work of a great musical mastermind and a band that has clarity of vision and the talent to create art in sound. \\"Deadwing\\" is a masterpiece. It does not get any better than this.
B00000GB76|5.0|Fabrizio de Andr was born in Genoa on February 18, 1940.  His career as a songwriter and performer began in the late fifties, under the strong influence of the French chansonniers, especially Georges Brassens (1921-1981). In the late summer of 1998, Fabrizio de Andr was forced to stop his concert tour at the first symptoms of a serious disease which was later diagnosed as cancer.  Fabrizio de Andr died in Milan, Italy on January 11, 1999, at 2:30 am.  Two days later, he was buried in his native town of Genoa, Italy. The funeral was attended by an immense crowd of more than 10,000 people.

B0007DAZW8|1.0|WOW, what a mediocre album, and from such a talented innovative band.  daft punk has always pushed the envelope and reinvented itself with each new album.  when homework came out it went against the grain of all the boring uninventive mac generated electronica that was flooding the market at the time.  the same could be said for discovery, which proved that they could do a sophomore album which didn't suck and wasn't just homework II.  none of this is true for human after all.  basically the album sounds like all the other repetitive dance garbage that flooded the market at the time homework.  and no, it is not as if they are making some radical statement against the current music scene.  and no, it is not repetitive and boring to challenge past daft punk fans like discovery did.  it is just plain mediocre.  sure, it is listenable, but it is not something that you will be playing a month from now. it is certainly not timeless like homework and discovery.  it really has the feeling of one of those albums that a band has to put out to fullfill a record contract that they are trying to get out of.  do your wallet a favor and borrow a friends copy before investing your hard earned cash.  better yet, buy my copy for 10 cents off e bay.
006072448X|5.0|I could not put this book down and became very anti-social whilst I read it. <br />The way in which this book is written (in a letter format) is really clever.  The characters were so well developed and at times I felt sorry for each of them and mad at each of them. <br />This book really moved me at times and as the reader it is up to YOU to decide many of the things in this book as we are only supplied with the mother's knowledge through her letters. <br />And just as I thought I had the story all figured out it gave one last twist at the end that really got me thinking.
B0007XT87G|3.0|TO ANYONE WHO IS NEW TO PT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET IN ABSENTIA, LIGHTBULB SUN OR STUPID DREAM BEFORE BUYING THIS ANY OF THOSE CDS PUTS THIS ALBUM TO SHAME.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that THIS CD PUTS ALL OTHER MAINSTREAMISH ROCK CURRENTLY BEING MADE TO SHAME SO DONT HESITATE TO GET IT OVER THE NEXT CREED CD(ugh shudder) or the 100s of other bands just like them....its just not up to PT standards which are far and away above 99% of the bands out there, let me also say that my 2 favorite bands in the world are PT and Opeth probably PT more by just a hair so maybe this review is a result of being spoiled by PTs excellent music pre deadwing.  Now i really think this cd gets 4 stars but im rating it on the PT scale so the bar is set far higher...incidentally one star for each almost great song on the cd...  This is the first PT cd ive never fallen in love with from first listen and never thought WOW that was a great song while listening....also the first PT album where i actually srongly dislike songs....ive been listening for a month now and i just cant \\"get into it\\" the magic is just not there, i dig a few parts to a few songs but there is not one whole song that i dont feel like hitting the fast forward button because im bored/frustrated of hearing the same lines and music for 4 mins straight with no changes and the \\"heavyness\\" seems artifically injected to appeal to us musically depraved Americans<br /><br />DEADWING 3.5/5: 2 mins of real music and inspiration wrapped in 10 mins of repetition.<br /><br />SHALLOW  1/5: Well what the heck is this??  This might b the equivalent of metallicas black album, this is trouble<br /><br />LAZARUS 3.5/5:  I want to like this song so much! but i cant...it starts great but by the hundreth time u hear \\"follow me down....\\" within 4 minutes with really no change in the music it gets annoying<br /><br />HALO 3.5/5:  I like it but something annoys me about it to let me fuly enjoy<br /><br />ARRIVING SOMEWHERE... 4/5:  One of the few bright spots again i wish SW thought of a few more lines to throw in instead of repeating \\"and all of my plans...\\"  1000x but once it gets going it rocks Mikes little solo fits well<br /><br />MELLOTRON SCRATCH 3.5/5:  Hmmm a pattern here more repetition for 4:30 mins then finally gets going, the end saves this quirky little song<br /><br />OPEN CAR 3.5/5:  Most people dont seem to like it....but i kinda do wish it didnt repeat so much....<br /><br />START OF SOMETHING.. 4/5: Same boat as arriving...starts slow plus the R word but once it gets going its good<br /><br />GLASS ARM... 1/5:  I just do not like this song by the 100th time i hear \\"feeling all your touching feeling all your love\\" i want to puke<br /><br />SHESMOVEDON 4/5:  My favorite PT track of all time though this version is good the original is much better (5/5+ much more dramatic and moving...kinda like all their other cds before this, better vocals) fairly short, sweet, only takes 30 sec to get going unlike every song on this cd though the chorus \\"she changes everytime...\\" may repeat many times throughout the song the music is constantly shifting and changing (less so in this version) behind it which is what this cd is missing<br /><br />I really dont like the darker more negative tone this cd sets (Ill listen to Opeth for that)This is the worst of the recent style PT style cds (starting with Signify)  Where is the creativity of the past cds....this whole album has about as much as \\"Trains\\" or \\"Hatesong\\".  Wheres the blackest eyes, trains, shesmovedon, hatesong, stranger than fiction, dont hate me, waiting of the cd??? This cd is missing those killer tracks with a cast of great songs around them.  Instead its comprised of songs that r almost good/great but (and this is my biggest issue with the cd if u couldnt tell already) are insanely REPETITIVE.  Now im not one of those that wants bands to remake cds and not progress quite the contrary ive loved their progression but replacing good music with repetition does not make a great cd.....I suspect that all Steven Wilsons side projects are taking its toll on PT sapping the creativity from it...that and he apparently gave the rest of the band more control over the material (probably cuz he had no time with all his other projects going on and we all know what happens when that starts)  all that being said i still have faith in SW and think he will rebound with another classic...COME ON SW!!!  YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!!!eat cd.....I suspect that all Steven Wilsons side projects are taking its toll on PT sapping the creativity from it...that and he apparently gave the rest of the band more control over the material (probably cuz he had no time with all his other projects going on and we all know what happens when that starts)  all that being said i still have faith in SW and think he will rebound with another classic...COME ON SW!!!

B00063MBU8|1.0|Wow, i only like one song from this album, and that \\"welcome to my life\\".  Just think of this, i save some money to get a couple of cd, and decided to pick this one up, and what a surprise, this album stink. <br /> <br />yes, it notting like good charlotte.  I thought it would be an perfect album like the young and the hopeless but as it turn out, it notting like good charlotte. Should have got good charlotte debut cd or maybe even a tribute to good charlotte <br /> <br />yes, i do believe these guy have talent, however they have kiddy like song and a few bad lyric.  However welcome to my life is in my top 50 best song of all time.   <br /> <br />The bottom line is not to get this, if you were to get this for just one, two, or maybe three song, i highly recommended you to download it online.  And, if you can't download, tell your friend to download it for you, and trust me, you will be better not buying this album. <br /> <br />
B000000JO3|5.0|Minor Threat are among the most important bands to ever leave their mark on the punk scene. While they never had the longevity of the Ramones or the massive sales of the Sex Pistols they came to define an entire movement that on even today. Ian McKaye and company thumped with a double-time tough guy punk vibe that helped get the hardcore movement off and running. Being the kings of the D.C. scene they also inspired much of the intellectual side of the hardcore scene that many in other areas were attempting to avoid. Liberal without being weak, intelligent without being nerdy (well - excluding Brian Baker), and musically powerful as all hell - Minor Threat are to be held among the legends. <br /> <br />This compilation of their entire released catalog (other tracks do exist elsewhere) with classics and clunkers alike. It's all mixed up and mastered to sound nice and clear and the redone artwork includes full lyrics and photographs that chronicle the bands rise to power. Thankfully it lacks a big rant from a famous critic (classy) with all sorts of pointless praise and instead includes the classic cover artwork to \\"Out of Step\\" on the back. From beginning to end, Minor Threat evolved from a primitive hardcore band with a brain that howled against the system to a rather melodic band that hinted at Ian McKaye's future projects. With Minor Threat there isn't such thing as a dull moment, and this compilation does much to cement this fact. <br /> <br />The key tracks that help define the band to a newcomer might include the double-kicking \\"Filler\\", the raging \\"Screaming at a Wall\\", and personal anthem \\"Minor Threat\\". Other key performances pop up on \\"12XU\\" and \\"Guilty of Being White\\" as well. While this CD really doesn't have any missing links, these tracks are a good introduction to the band and will help the beginner find his way around the ever-important world of Minor Threat. If you've been in the hardcore scene long enough and you don't own all of these songs and youneed to be reading the review - shame on you. <br /> <br />Minor Threat are a classic band from a time long by that needs to be continually praised and remembered for their short career. Unlike many bands they left when they should have, avoided a crap reunion and kept the memory alive through recordings that are still powerful to this day. If you're an old-skool fan you should already own these tracks. If you're new to all of this...BUY IT!  <br /> <br />You won't regret the decision.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|i heard this cd at my friends house last night. it was pretty good since most of the songs are nice and has good lyrics. and if you have all of mariah's cd go get this one as well.
B00000IP4H|3.0|This CD is an odd one to me. It rips and burns like crazy on the guitars and the vocals are thick and meaty - but it seems only half inspired in moments. For all the brutal \\"death metal\\" derived rage the album falls short of the greatness of the old thrash records and the power of \\"The Gathering\\". Riding the line...but not in a good way sometimes. <br /> <br />Standouts though do occur on this record...mostly notably \\"John Doe\\" and \\"Demonic Refusal\\". Both songs are primed and FULL of piss and vinegar. <br /> <br />Overall...this CD is a worthy buy...but really seems stuck in a transitional mode.
B000784WMW|5.0|Hurrah!  I am so thrilled that this version is finally out on DVD.  Thank you, BBC!  I fell in love with this version while watching PBS in the 80's because it is THE definitive version.  Well, the DVD is even more so, because there is an incredible amount of scenes that were not even present in the video release, which I also own.  How much do I love this version?  Enough to have purchased 2 DVD's, in case something happens to one, and actually considering a third for viewing on my computer!! Fine acting, set and costumes to die for, the true feel of a classic BBC presentation, and completely true to the novel.  If you are a fan of Jane Eyre or simply looking for the best version out there, to add to your collection, this is the one for you.  Happy viewing!
B000066JES|5.0|What a mighty record we have here. The Kings of Metal have blessed us again with tunes worthy of gods. Millenia have we waited to hear from them again, but now we have new anthems to be bought into battle and that will surely help us slay the infidels.  <br /> <br />Manowar can only stay true to their style. It is the only true form of Metal. As pure as it gets. They have no time for \\"Whimps and Posers\\". I expect them never to change their style unless they are affected by an ancient spell. In that case I will gather my warriors and fight against the blasphemous Witch responsible so that they will once again fill our ears with pure melodies. <br /> <br />Call To Arms - 10/10 An Anthem that talks about brave warriors and how we must follow in their footsteps. When the call comes we must gather our steed, armour, and strength and rush into battle. With this hymn we are reminded of the sure victory awaiting us. Those who defend the kingdom and are slain will always be in our hearts. <br /> <br />Fight For Freedom - 8/10 A mighty tune. Reminds us that brave warriors have already fought for our freedom. There have been many great battles and there will be many more still to be fought. We must approach the battlefields with pride and with our women and children in our thoughts and hearts. <br /> <br />Nessun Dorma - 6/10 - Vincero. I will win. At dawn the battle will be over and the enemies will be lying on the reddened fields. <br /> <br />Valhalla - n/a - An ode to our comrades who have fallen in battle and are now being greeted at the Gates of Valhalla. <br /> <br />Swords In The Wind - 10/10 - A mighty song that tells us how to fight. We are all Oden's children and those who fight with honor will be welcomed to valhalla were our brothers are waiting for them. We must have no fear. So when we are falling, we must laugh at our death.  <br /> <br />An American Trilogy - 6/10 - Again we must be reminded of past wars, the pain, and the glorious outcomes.  <br /> <br />TheMarch - n/a - another interlude that prepares us for the greatest hymn of all time. <br /> <br />Warriors Of The World - 10/10 - The greatest war hymn ever. Calling all true warriors to unite and gather strength for a mighty clash with the enemy. <br /> <br />Hand Of Doom - 8/10 - A fast song that fills our souls with energy that we must unleash upon the infidels. Ours will be their hand of doom. We must tear their flesh limb by limb and feed it to wolves. <br /> <br />House Of Death - 7/10 - Like the previous poem, we are told how to fight and slain the enemy. We must kill and fight. <br /> <br />Fight Until We Die - 9/10 - Another fast tune that sounds like thousands of knights charging into hords of barbarian beasts. We ask the Gods of Thunder Fire and Rain to let us fight to the best of our skills and that they must let us die if our time comes. <br /> <br />Conclusion: Hail Manowar, Hail!!!
B000000I0J|4.0|After my initiation into the Mike Oldfield Fan Convergence with the original release of both TUBULAR BELLS and HERGEST RIDGE, I became ravenous for all things Olfield. OMMADAWN only slaked my thirst temporarily, but it was finally quenched at last with the songs featured here, only as a \\"different animal.\\" This was previously released here in a \\"special edition\\" vinyl LP (which I still own, thank G*d!) which was called AIRBORN. This album included the title track, plus \\"Platinum,\\" \\"Charleston,\\" \\"North Star/Finale,\\" (co-written with Philip Glass,) \\"Into Wonderland,\\" \\"Punkadiddle\\" and \\"I Got Rhythm.\\" \\"Sally\\" and \\"Woodhenge\\" are the replacements for \\"Wonderland,\\" I take it, which was a kind of lilting, silly, Mike-channeling-McCartney-at-his-loopiest sorta thing.<br /><br />AIRBORN was a two-album set, (anybody remember those?) which also offered some 'preview' cuts of EXPOSED, with live-edit versions of \\"Incantations,\\" \\"Tubular Bells\\" and \\"Guilty.\\"<br /><br />The editing on the U.S. version was so well-done, I now consider the first four songs as a suite (or sweet, just as apropos), that chronicles Mike's wonderful journey out of the weightier themes and concepts of his first three albums, into something a little more accessible for the casual listener as well as the die-hard Oldfield fans. A little more commercial than some would probably like, but the indelible Oldfield stamp is there, with enough razor-sharp guitar hooks and fills to keep it substantial.<br /><br />I haven't heard this version yet, but I look forward to see how it compares to the \\"other\\" version.
B0007GAERG|4.0|The album is great Mariah's best since \\"Butterfly\\".

B00005R2IS|5.0|Excellent to watch with the original Australian audio track and with the road rants trivia. Now, where's the \\"Humongous\\" edition of The Road Warrior? This movie needs a serious DVD Special Edition!!
B00005JKEZ|4.0|Take nothing away from Kevin Costner or Sean Connery's Robin. They are very good. Errol Flynn was my first Robin as a child, again very recently & many times in between. It's lush, extravagant & colorful. Let's not forget those great characters of the 30's; Alan Hale, Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone etc. Then there is of course the mega watt beauty of a young Olivia deHavilland. <br />  You can't have enough Rovin Hood movies, & for sheer romantic, fun & entertainment, this is the one.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Now then, about the album.  Porcupine Tree has been one of the leaders in the field of music for a while.  To be more specific, they are leaders in the field of music that progresses, music that changes from album to album, song to song, and even in the middle of songs.  They have managed to make a more complex album than 'In Absentia' while still retaining a freshness that they have carried for the past several albums.  'Deadwing' is probably the most tight album while also being the most musically wandering album.  All the songs have their own unique feel while also holding a conciseness that makes this album so great. <br /> <br />There are the heavier songs (Deadwing, Shallow and Halo) that are incredibly catchy but without losing the atmosphere of Porcupine Tree in the process.  There are the softer songs (Lazarus, Mellotron Scratch and Glass Arm Shattering) that are easy to listen to while still being very lush in Porcupine Tree's unique musical flavor.  Finally, there are the songs that fall in the middle (Arriving Somewhere but Not Here, Open Car and The Start of Something Beautiful) that have all of Porcupine Tree's aspects in them.  Open Car starts out somewhat heavy, but builds up to show that it has a flow to it as it weaves in and out of the different walls of music.   <br /> <br />As far as the album's structure goes, it's as great as anyone could expect from Porcupine Tree.  While I would have made the album to flow from heavy to soft (or visa versa), Porcupine Tree has managed to make it's songs so varied, that they change from heavy to light in the middle of songs and then flow on to the next song in the same fashion so that it never feels that there is an abrupt or missplaced track on the album.  Also, one of the key parts of Porucpine Tree's albums is the closing track.  'Glass Arm Shattering' has to be the best offering for a closing track that they have ever proposed.  While the song 'Half Light' was intended to be the closing track, it doesn'tquite match the brilliance of the chosen closer (even though it is another exceptional closer also). <br /> <br />This album is the best display of music that Porucpine Tree has created.  Whether you are a fan that is already into the group, or you are just starting to look into the group, this album is just as good of a place to start as 'In Absentia.'  It does have a little bit of a different vibe than all the other albums, but that's what everyone has come to expect from this group, they change their sound, and each time they do, it's absolutely amazing.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. However, I want to warn you that two of these reviews for this movie are incorrectly posted to this link. You'll find two reviews which should have been posted to the 3-Disc Unrated Director's Cut Version. When I ordered this product, I thought I was getting a killer bargain for under $10. However, what arrived today wasn't what I thought that I had paid for. I received the basic Widescreen DVD, and not the 3-Disc Director's Cut Unrated DVD which two reviewers spoke of. I think you should be aware of this. Now I'm faced with trying to go through the hassle of returning this item, and paying an additional amount for the more expensive $24 version.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love this film. This is one of my favourite film for all time. However as I was waiting for the releasing of DVD especially the 2-Disc Special Edition.  I was so disappointed to the way that they put the special feature.  I meant that I would love to see lot...lot...lot of things in the film such as an interview of Gerard Butler, Joel Schumacher, Patrick Wilson, etc. But after watching the special feature parts \\"Behind the Mark\\" I did understand for one thing that ALW would like to honor the original casts and crews of \\"The Phantom of The Opera\\" (Stage Performance).  That part took almost 70 mins with the interviewing, the old footages of something that you might called it as the historical of the stage shows in bits and pieces.  I'm not said that I hate it but...it bored me to death.  I would appreciated if they put the bits and pieces of behind the scene, the rehearsal, the singing class or voice practices of the cast especially Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson.  The only part that I really like is the deleted scene \\"No One Would Listen\\" and the cast & crew sing-along (that's very funny).  The rest I would not said it bad, it's sort of educational rather than entertainment.  I am not the musician and no idea about the composing the music.  I'm just an ordinary film lover who enjoy good film, good acting and sweet music, that's all.  I can only say that I love the deleted scene, second to the film, Well! I think that comforted me a little bit for the times I have been waiting for this special edition to be released.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had to laugh when the ship, \\"Firefly\\" was referred to as a boat. <br />But what a great place to live - traveling the galaxy. <br /> <br />It seems we go five hundred years into the future [such as it is] and meet the Firefly-class spaceship SERENITY.  We soon learn this is named after a battle that introduces us to [Nathan Fillion] Mal Reynolds, the captian of Serenity.  He seems to have fallen in love with this ship. <br /> <br />I will admit that the presence of Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb was another reason I wanted to collect this series.  I certainly enjoyed the conflict and bonding of this group of characters and their risque way of talking. <br /> <br />I didn't know that there was a difference between a \\"Companion\\" and a prostitute.  Morena Baccarin as \\"Inara\\" was very beautiful in this role.  It appeared that there was an intense attraction between Inara and Mal. <br /> <br />The brilliant doctor, Simon and his genius sister, River added a great element of being on the run from the men in blue. <br /> <br />They showed us the meeting of Wash as a great navigator and pilot of the Serenity and then we find out that he and Zoe, Mal's right hand warrior, are married.  When did Wash ask Zoe for her hand in marriage?  Eventually she says it is about time to have a baby - Wash seems reluctant. <br /> <br />The intoduction to Jewel Staite as \\"Kaylee\\" was a bit torrid and a bit embarassing to Mal.  Kaylee was the only one that could keep Serenity in running shape. <br /> <br />I about cracked up when \\"Saffron\\" claimed marriage to Mal and her seduction scene with Mal ending up flat on the floor.  And that wasn't the end of their association. <br /> <br />Ah, but Jayne was a masculine riot.  I loved his character - his uncaring attitude which didn't hold, his flustered and embarassed attitude when he finds out that the mudders have made a hero out of his memory.  He definitely wants the reward for turning in the fugitives, Simon and River and then has to rescue them. <br /> <br />The great scene [other than Mal being naked in the desert - a bit funny] was when they were standing on the edge of nowhere and Serenity appears in the back of them, rising like a giant monster.  [reminds me of the sub blasting out of the ocean in \\"Hunt for Red October\\"]  Same feeling of WOW! <br /> <br />Not a set for kids - but great adult entertainment! <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - thoroughly enjoyable!  definitely a keeper!
0385510454|3.0|Definitely not his best. After the first few chapters of sluggish going, I wondered if his editors even bothered to proof-read the manuscript. It drags out and could be finished, entertainingly, in half the pages. Get the paperback, take it on a trip, but don't let it be your only book. You may want to stop in the middle, and no one would blame you.
0446677450|1.0|For the most part, it seems that people either love or hate the book and now having read it, I think I understand why. Most likely it seems that it depends on your personal situation and knowledge prior to reading the book.    I think that if you were someone who was just making ends meet, using all of your salary to support your lifestyle (in Kiyosakian parlance, buying \\"liabilities\\") and doing little to save and invest (buying \\"assets\\"), I can see that this book might serve as a wake up call and can inspire and motivate people to look for ways to possibly change their situation. Furthermore, the book's various claims, (however misleading or unrealistic as I point out below) plays right into such people's desires to learn the \\"secret of success\\" of the rich that if only they knew, they could quit (or abandon their plans) to go to school, quit their jobs and just invest and live off of investments the rest of their lives without working.    OTOH, if like many of us, you were making a good salary WORKING but spending responsibly (i.e. limiting \\"liabilities) and meanwhile trying to invest aggressively as much as we know how to do based on our unique circumstances and preferences (buying \\"assets\\"), the book really provides no substance and stretches credibility. For us, you don't need inspiration and what specific info the book provides is either dated, incorrect, or misleading. Also for many of us, we didn't read it realizing ahead of time that it was entirely a motivational book rather than a \\"methods\\" book since the title alludes to \\"methods\\" that that rich possess that we of humbler backgrounds lack.    This book makes fantastic claims. There is a quick and easy \\"secret of success\\" that \\"the rich\\" (always treated as a monolithic group) know and the rest of us don't; this \\"secret information\\" is far more important than hard work, getting a good education, investing wisely, or any traditional method to become rich and successful; and if you only learn \\"the secret\\" (translation: buy Kiyosaki's book) you, too, will be rich.    According to Kiyosaki, \\"the rich\\" become rich by using three different strategies: 1). They form and own corporations, thus paying less taxes than people who get their income as employees. 2). They invest in real estate in certain \\"secret\\" ways that let them earn a lot of money with little risk or tax liability; 3). They use tips from friends for insider's trading to make a killing in the stock market. Kiyosaki's advice, in essence, is to suggest to the reader to emulate \\"the rich\\" by using the same tax-avoidance strategies, real-estate schemes, and insider's trading \\"they\\" supposedly use to get rich.    There are only two tiny problems with Kiyosaki's advice. First of all, these \\"secret strategies\\" are NOT the way the rich actually make money; it is rather the LAYMAN'S IMPRESSION of how the rich make money, an impression based mainly on numerous TV shows and movies which portray \\"the rich\\" in this way. As the (excellent) book \\"the millionaire next door\\" shows, this description bears no more relation to how the rich actually make money than James Bond films have to actual espionage work.    Second, not surprisingly, the \\"strategies\\" Kiyosaki proposes could work only in the movies - where, of course, the government and police are all in the millionaire's pocket, and let him \\"get away with it\\". If you actually try them in the real world, you will be laughed at, waste your time and money, get audited by the IRS, or worse.    For example, in reality, coroprations are *not* good tax shelters. In reality, you *cannot* deduct your personal expenses as \\"business expenses\\", or have your corporation give you \\"tax-free gifts\\" such as trips to Hawai or Rolex watches, as Kiyosaki claims. Doing so would get you audited and stiffly fined (or worse.) Also, in reality, \\"insider's trading\\" is a felony which could land you in jail. Finally, in reality, Koyisaki's real-estate advice is either illegal (as in his claim of usinghis cat as a \\"business partner\\"), immoral (as in getting \\"good deals\\" from unsophisticated sellers, apparently based on the principle of \\"it is immoral to let a sucker keep his money\\"), or doesn't work in the real world (such as his claims that he offered 275K for a 450K building and \\"they agreed to 300K\\", or that a bank agreed to take 50K instead of 60K for property he bought \\"simply because it was a cashier's check.\\")...This book, in summary, paints a fantasy picture of the world, and gives \\"financial advice\\" that will make you a laughing stock at best and put you in jail for insider's trading or tax evasion at worse.    If you have dreams of being the next Gates, Trump, etc, I'd say go for it. But don't give up your day job just yet based on Kiyosaki's fantasy notions because the real world doesn't work that way. The bottom line is that whether you work hard at a profession as an employee or whether you work hard to invest and build businesses, you will need to work. It is safe to say that while a few people will be able to invest and build businesses and live off of their assets without working, many of us won't be able to pull it off. There's nothing wrong with trying but don't do it with the mistaken notion that you'll automatically be better off than if you kept your job and invested carefully over a lifetime because you probably won't be.
B000002NJS|5.0|Although branded as a musician, Madonna has been notoriousily famous for a very long time for reasons that have anything but to do with music. It's been her vision, and her image as the irrepressibile will of beauty, that has kept her in the limelight. She has hinted at musical accomplishment before- it's hard to ignore the fact that even though she is largely a pop icon, that her early career still shows a strong, unique edge- but she has always, up to this point, been restrained by her own desires to push rather then to sculpt. Leaveing the song writing duties to others most certainly didn't help her case.<br /><br />Many years, a child, and a new music scene later, Madonna emerges from the dust reborn- spiritually and musically- as a force to be reconked with. Her power here is evident- she takes full control of the details, she injects her very pulse into each song. Madonna records of the past have been pop commentaries on things Madonna has viewed and seen, but this here, this is different. This is an album OF Madonna. This is her essence. This is a woman that no longer feels the need to paint someone else's picture.<br /><br />Helping her create and craft a more eloquent, layered and sonic mood is William Orbit, whom does a brilliant job of catapulting Madonna into the new decade with fine electronic nuances that take the music all over the map. The texture here is very rich- Madonna's voice is at it's finest (her recent professional training is defiantly evident as she tackles high notes on \\"Ray of Light\\")- and the overall production meshes the two very well together. The songs are ultimately fresh and flavorful, without loseing a sense of being a complete peice. \\"Swim\\", \\"Skin\\", and \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" all groove and shake, while \\"Drowned World\\" and \\"Frozen\\" approriately shimmer and chill. This is an album of pure energy and emotion, without ever becoming maniac.<br /><br />Doing a track by track anlaysis of this album is almost a moot point, because thier simply isn't a weak moment on here. The only deviding point becomes personal preference- there's something magical taking place here, somewhere between the head and the heart. The whole album, even the flash of brillance that was \\"Ray of Light\\", is a dark, creeping thrill. The kind that breathes down your neck and grips you in place, but never quite scares away.<br /><br />To this date, this stands as Madonna's most mature venture, and defiantly her strongest album of her career. It's hard to believe that just a few years later Madonna has reverted to a mirror of her former self- a sad thing to see, because what we have here in \\"Ray of Light\\", now and forever, is a captured moment of the Madonna we associate with true power.r simply isn't a weak moment on here.

This live version shows how well they play their instruments in the middle of the actual song.(AKA the scary, loud, noisy part) <br /> <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Great album.   My fav is \\"More than anyone\\".  I sing it to my baby, who will be arriving in July.  <br /> <br />Gavin's voice is strong and sexy.  I love the CD!
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best, Hip hop album of all time. Snoop Dogg is only 19 on here, Produced by Dr. Dre, and features Tha Dogg Pound, Dramatics, Lady of Rage. There are 13 songs and almost all of them are classics.  <br /> <br />1. Intro 3/5- Decent snoop talks about he wants to leave the game. <br />2. Gfunk Intro-4/5 snoop only raps a little bit at the end but says a classic line. Beat is killer. <br />3. Gin and Juice 5/5- Instant classic. Snoop raps 3 verses and everything flows very well. <br />4. Tha Shiznit 5/5- Another Classic. Snoop raps quickly and nonstop. Very catchy. <br />5. Lodi Dodi 5/5-  A story about snoop dogg and this girl wanting drugs. His voice is just amazing on this one. <br />6. Murder Was the Case 5/5- Probably the best song on here. Lyrics are very good and beat is kind of scary almost. Gives you an erie feeling. <br />7. Serial Killer 3/5- The first misstep on the album, but its still a 3/5! <br />8. Whats my Name 5/5- Classic song with dre beat. Cant get enough snoop on this one.  <br />9. For all my niggaz + bitches 4/5- Refrain is kind of repetitive and snoop only has one verse, but its pretty catchy and the others more than make up for it. <br />10. Aint no fun 5/5- Ft. Nate Dogg. Nates refrain is smooth and the others add a lot to this song. Wish it had more snoop though. <br />11. DoggyDogg World 5/5- Ft. Dramatics. Another classic. not much more to say. <br />12. Gz and Hustlaz 5/5- Keyboard beat and the intro is kind of funny too. Snoop raps 3 verses, he cant be controlled. <br />13. Pump Pump 4/5- Refrain is kind of clever. I think malik is in this one. Snoop makes of for the mediocre stuff. <br /> <br />This album is a must have for anyone. If you dont like this album then you just must hate rap music, because every song will have you bobbing your head and snoop doggs dreamy drawl will have you hitting repeat. Great for partys. After this snoop falls off a little bit. On paar with All Eyez on Me, Ready to Die, and Chronic.
B0007GAERG|5.0|THE SONGTRESS IS BACK.  This is the Mariah we all feel in love with.  I'm glad she overcame her personal issues and contiuned singing.  This is a true entertainer and this is one of if not THE GREATEST SINGERS.......EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0006547745|4.0|Did you know that the Middle East is home to Christians---a lot of them?  Before reading this book, it never clicked for me that the ancient traditions of Christianity are alive in communities throughout the land where they began.  Author William Dalrymple recreates the journey of John Moschos, a saint from the 500's, beginning in Greece and traveling through Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt.  He discovers how much the Middle East has changed since the days of the Christian Byzantine Empire, and how much it has stayed the same.  He discusses art, politics, history, and theology, discovering connections between eastern and western Christian traditions and the continuity of the Christian faith no matter what the culture.  This is an eye-opening look at not only the politics of the Middle East but also the existence of Middle Eastern, ancient Christian churches.

0452283760|5.0|I read this first in September of 2004, and after a lot of thought, it officially replaced Nineteen Eighty-Four as my overall favorite novel.<br />Many people think that this is a psuedo-fiction 'novel' about capitalism with a lot of rhetoric - it is not. Though brilliant, Atlas Shrugged touches a lot more on politics and has a lot of long speeches by its characters, and therefore could be said to have non-fiction segments.<br />However, The Fountainhead is the story of an egoist/individualist and his consistent optimisism in an irrational society. The novel is dedicated to 'The noble profession of architecture,' the perfect profession to use as an example in the story. The characters are strong, the plot builds up to a passionate climax that compeltely reflects his personality, and you grow attached to the different characters, especially him and two others. <br />This is one of, or the greatest novel ever written. If you haven't bought it yet, I suggest that you do so now - it will be one of the most selfish things you've ever done, nobly enough.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This a great series.I love this show and it has great acting,stories,and characters.I hope Warner releases Season 2 soon because I need a resolution to that cliffhanger.This is quality television that you should check out.
B0006213WG|3.0|Sum 41 has truly been the epitome of a band who has traveled through pretty much every stage of rock.  Their All Killer No Filler album appeared to be the catchiest album, featuring more \\"pop punk\\" hits such as \\"Motivation,\\" \\"Fat Lip,\\" and \\"In Too Deep.\\"  In their next album, a more serious atmosphere had surrounded most of the songs.  However, the melodious chord quality that was in their first album was still present in their second album, and blended with the dose of alternative that I think made their Does This Look Infected CD their best album.  When I popped in their Chuck CD, I was not surprised that Sum 41 had taken a step further in incorporating more metal aspects into their music.  I myself am not a big heavy metal fan, but I can connect with most of the songs on this album.  Although this album is not their best, I would recommend at least listening to it.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|4.0 to 4.5 stars.    I have a hard time giving out 5 stars to a movie because that means the movie pretty much achieved perfection, whether to me personally or in the grand scheme of moviedom.  However, I do think that the makers of Napoleon Dynamite had goals in mind with this movie and I think they achieved those goals in making a very entertaining movie.  For a lot of people, acheiving your set goals can mean perfection.  For reaching those goals, I think it means they put out a darn good movie.    This is definitely a character driven, as opposed to a plot driven, movie.  The characters and the actors that play them stand out and make the scenes memorable.  None of the characters seem to be like anyone I know, yet I can see a lot myself and others throughout bits and pieces of everyone.  Maybe that makes it hard to specifically identify with them but I did like that even the \\"mean kids\\" weren't as mean as Hollywood likes to make the bully.  And the \\"good kids\\" weren't as pure and infallible on the other end.  And because the extremes aren't so far apart, it doesn't put characters far out of reach for us, in spite of their quirkiness.    The script is simple but well written and although there really aren't any punchlines, the \\"jokes\\" are buried in layers and require multiple viewings to catch them all, whether they are spoken or visual.  And the movie provides plenty of lines that are quotable in everyday life without being filled with innuendo or questionable language.    Finally, I have a theory about this movie.  Most of the characters are in High School, but are really stuck at the stage of life they were in during 5th grade.  Whether it is what they eat at lunch (tater tots), the things they are into (bikes, not cars), the drawings, the ninja stars, etc., I see myself at age 11.  Maybe this isn't even the filmmakers intention, but look at them with this point of view and see if you enjoy the movie even more.    In all, they have pulled off making a film that appeals to a wide range of ages.  It isn't for everybody, like any film, but it has broad appeal for a lot of viewers.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I've been sitting here reading the reviews of this movie and am sooo disapointed with my countrymen. The only group of people who could possibly fall for this piece of left wing propoganda are those who get the news from Hollywood. If you want to know whats going on in Iraq talk to the hero's who have fought there. In this war or the last. If you want to get all the \\"facts\\" dont go to the fools that live in Hollywood. Try watching more than just your local news. Watch all news programs CNN, FOX, BBC or for those out there who can read pick up some newspapers. Bush is'nt God but, Moore is'nt either. Please start using YOUR brains and stop buying into whats shown to you.
B0006399FS|4.0|**IN A NUTSHELL, IF YOU'VE LIKED U2'S ALBUMS BEFORE, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU'LL LIKE THIS ALBUM.  IF YOU HAVE NOT LIKED THEM, YOU WON'T LIKE THIS ALBUM** <br /> <br />3.5 stars <br /> <br />I've given myself enough time to listen to this album to feel I can fairly judge it for myself.  I can't claim it to be their best album, their worst album, etc.  But I do think it is a solid album with only a few blemishes. <br /> <br />U2 seems to put a lot of thought into the order of songs on an album, particularly the first and last songs.  Vertigo, the most recognized and possibly overplayed single from Atomic Bomb is definitely the most rocking track on the disc.  It is as if they wanted to pound something out so that the rest of the album is cathartic, in a way.  At the end is Yahweh, a great closer, very upbeat and right in the tradition of U2 songs that deal with their faith and, also typical, it brings in lyrics that can be heard in different ways. <br /> <br />In between, we get some ups and downs.  Personally, City of Blinding Lights is my favorite and I worry that I'll over play it.  A grand number that tries to recreate the size of Where the Streets Have No Name, even if it doesn't quite achieve that.  My least favorite is All Because of You, primarily because I don't like the range to which Bono takes his voice.   <br /> <br />Musically, I think the songs are strong, if not always original (but if U2 is doing the U2 sound, is that unoriginal?).  Some of the songs do seem a bit repetitive in their sound and feel and it doesn't always work since it isn't a theme across the entire album, like on Joshua Tree.  But the sound almost always feels like a U2 sound or their own interpretive spin and not an imitation.  I'm still digging into the meaning behind many of the lyrics. <br /> <br />But ultimately, an album like this will come down to personal taste.  U2 is making the music they *want* to make and they hope we like it.  It isn't my favorite U2 album of all time,but it is one of my favorite albums from 2004.
B0007P3582|2.0|The only real redeeming feature of this otherwise desperately appalling album is 'GET IN MY CAR'. Ponder on this for a while, 50 Cent took issue with The Game because he was getting left on the side while Dr. Dre was churning out 'The Documentary' (a much better album and a fine first commercial release). 'The Massacre' is crap pure and simple, you only have to listen to 'Piggy Bank' to analyse how badly 50 cent misses Dr. Dre's magic touch and when Dre dos contribute the lyrics do not reward the fantastic production in fact I found my self ignoring the lyrics completeley and just settling in to the beat (listen to 'Gunz Come Out'). Scott Storch also puts a dent in the monument of dissapointment that 50 has constructed with 'Candy Shop' and 'Just A Lil Bit' but unfortunately it is not enough to enable me to let this album cling to 3 stars. Okay at best.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Absolutely ridiculous,awe-inspiring,stupendous,unbelievably amazing how-good-these-musicians are!! I had to get someone to peel me off the wall. Porcupine Tree,without a doubt,leaves most bands out there today choking on the Tree's dust. I'm not gonna break this album down, I'll leave that for the so-called \\"critics.\\" But, I must add; Steven Wilson is a master producer and musician. Gavin Harrison's drumming really shines for me. If you buy anything in the next few minutes, make it this beauty. Peace.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Many reviewers said that this album is the best since Butterfly. I Think that Rainbow is way better than this album. It have more powerful ballads and the rapping on the songs are way better \\"Jay Z & Missy\\".  I admit that \\"It's Like That\\" is one of Mariah's best uptempo songs, but honestly JD is very annoying. This guy should not rap. I mean his voice make the song sound worse! In a song like \\"Get Your Number\\" which sounds like it was taken from the Glitter album have JD rapps on it mostly all of the song and he is the chorus in that song. I would like the song if he is not the one rapping. Another \\"not a perfect\\" song is Mine Again. Mariah's voice really hurts the ears when she starts to sing the chorus. Where is her powerful & soft voice in \\"Against All Odds\\" or \\"My All\\". She sounds in Mine again like she is screaming. Also one comment about the song \\"Your Girl\\"... What's up with that chorus and background vocals?! I can never listen to that song and I always skip it! <br /> <br />I give this Album 3 stars because there are good songs and Mariah proved that she still got her voice and still can make good songs.  <br /> <br /> <br />rating: <br />1. We Belong Together 9/10 <br />2. Its Like That 10/10 <br />3. Say Something 10/10 <br />4. Shake It Off 8/10 <br />5. Mine Again 5/10 <br />6. Circles 7/10 <br />7. Stay The Night 9/10 <br />8.

0553106635|5.0|GRRM is just brilliant.  No, I don't agree with or even like all the decision he makes but the story continues to draw me in nevertheless.  My heart broke several times in this reading-but I'm still greedy for more.  highly recommended.
B00006SFLV|4.0|If you grew up anytime in the mid 90's and watched this show, then you must get the DVD. It truly brings back all the memories of being a teen during the grunge era.  <br /> <br />Claire Danes, Jared Leto, AJ Langer, and the rest of the cast are a perfect fit. Although the actors are quite young, they have perfected the craft here. Their performances are fitting and each person brings something special to the show. Each episode is entertaining in it's own unique way. You will not be disspointed with this DVD set. It's a great collection to any home library.  <br /> <br />The only downside, and the reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars, is because the DVD has no extras. I would've liked to have seen some deleted scenes or cast interviews, etc. Also, because this collection is now out of print, it will cost you a pretty penny. I myself paid over $150 for it. But I was very pleased with my purchase, I wouldn't give it back for the world. <br /> <br />Overall, the My-So-Called-Life DVD set is a fun purchase for people who grew up with the show and liked it.  <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|The Killers are a unique rock band, I'll give them that.  Their synthesizer-heavy sound is both modern and retro, their lyrics are witty (even if the subject matter is trite), and most importantly, they can rock out really well.<br /><br />When they aren't rocking out, though, they mostly fail.  Songs like \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" and \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" plod along endlessly with absolutely nothing to keep me interested.  Other tracks, like \\"On Top\\" and \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" fare better, but are still lacking the energy present in other songs.<br /><br />But still, Hot Fuss is a solid album- The Killers have confidence and bravado with the skills to back it up.  \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" a song I absolutely hated at first but came to love, is hopelessly catchy.  \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\" are both great, as well. \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,\\" the leadoff track, reminds me a little of a faster paced \\"Zoo Station\\" by U2.  With its rocking guitars and great rhythm, it's my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />I liked this album, and I hope The Killers will tighten their sound while continuing to make great rock music.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|A unique and different kind of TV action series, MacGyver made its television premiere in the Fall of 1985 to much fanfare. Audiences immediately responded to the title character and his unusual penchant for turning everyday items like chewing gum and paperclips into elaborate life-saving contraptions. In this way, it maintained a slight resemblance to The A-Team, and this recurring plot device helped MacGyver build a strong cult following...  <br /> <br />Richard Dean Anderson plays the title role of MacGyver, an energetic employee of the fictional Phoenix Foundation for Research. An unorthodox hero by action series standards, MacGyver has a deadly fear of heights. A pacifist who refuses to use weapons, he relies heavily on his ability to use his brain and tinker with the various materials at his disposal. MacGyver's best friend, and the director of the Phoenix Foundation, is Pete Thornton (Dana Elcar). Pete often sends MacGyver on Foundation missions and sometimes comes to his aid (usually after MacGyver has saved the day). In addition, MacGyver is joined on a regular basis by his airplane pilot friend Jack Dalton (Bruce McGill), a man who constantly entangles himself in illegal activities and other troublesome situations. Between the usual slew of bad guys, the vendetta of archenemy Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), and his multitude of troublesome friends, MacGyver is always in the midst of interesting and dangerous events, and the show's true entertainment value derives from watching MacGyver's distinctive method of dealing with each one... <br /> <br />The MacGyver (Season 1) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the series pilot in which MacGyver is forced to race against the clock when a team of scientists are trapped underground after a lab experiment goes awry. Wanting to contain the leak, the Army allots a small time window for MacGyver to pull off his mission before they destroy the facility... Fans will make note of some interesting aspects of the pilot episode such as Dana Elcar's role as another character, MacGyver's use of a gun, and MacGyver's boss is a man named Gantner (Michael Lerner)... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \\"Trumbo's World\\" in which MacGyver, while on expedition in Brazil, encounters and wages war with a mile-wide column of army ants, and \\"Every Time She Smiles\\" in which MacGyver meets up with a beautiful, yet talkative, artist named Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher) and the two must escape the clutches of the KGB... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the MacGyver (Season 1) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Pilot)  <br />Episode 2 (The Golden Triangle)  <br />Episode 3 (Thief of Budapest)  <br />Episode 4 (The Gauntlet)  <br />Episode 5 (The Heist)  <br />Episode 6 (Trumbo's World)  <br />Episode 7 (Last Stand)  <br />Episode 8 (Hellfire)  <br />Episode 9 (The Prodigal)  <br />Episode 10 (Target MacGyver)  <br />Episode 11 (Nightmares)  <br />Episode 12 (Deathlock)  <br />Episode 13 (Flame's End)  <br />Episode 14 (Countdown)  <br />Episode 15 (The Enemy Within)  <br />Episode 16 (Every Time She Smiles)  <br />Episode 17 (To Be a Man)  <br />Episode 18 (Ugly Duckling)  <br />Episode 19 (Slow Death)  <br />Episode 20 (The Escape)  <br />Episode 21 (A Prisoner of Conscience)  <br />Episode 22 (The Assassin)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00025ETIW|5.0|First and foremost, I am a metal and a classic rock fan.  But this album surprised me unbelievably.  You can find something redeeming in any of the songs.  I only gave it a chance because of a friend and I'm glad I did.  Helena is the opening track, and although I don't think it is a very good opener, it is still a very good and diverse song.  I have no complaints about it except for one thing:  there is not enough metal or goth influence in it.  Yes there is some, but this is obviously aimed more toward the alt rock fans but hey, still an excellent album.   <br />     You should give this band a chance because I dont often comment on products but I had to for this one.  Every song is worth a listen and I believe MCR is going somewhere.  One big redeeming thing about it is most of their songs tell somewhat of a story instead of complain about their lives to feed whiny little kids more reasons to say their lives suck.  Everyone has problems and most peoples lives suck, so solve em.  I think that might be one of the things MCR is trying to get across.
1400032717|2.0|The \\"whodunnit\\" part is over half-way. Admittedly that's not the focus of the story, but it does mean the second half flags somewhat.    Not much effort was put into the surrounding characters. A good example is that the  phrase \\"I lost my rag\\" is given to the policeman, the father, and the mother. Probably the author's own favourite expression.     I also found it incredulous that on the one hand the parents supposedly have the insight to develop the 5 finger touch method to show affection, yet over and over are blind to Christopher's fundemental problems.    The style and tone changes in many of the maths and physics digressions, making it difficult to believe they are coming from Christopher. This reduces their role to irritating filler material. Since the entire point of the book is to transport the reader into an Asperger/Autistic mind, this represents a serious missed opportunity.     The mother's letters are laboured, clearly written at the reader, not mother to child. I even felt uneasy. \\"Comfort your son, forget about me! I get it, I get it.\\" I wanted to say.     Having recently experienced the London Underground for the first time myself, I found the description of the journey unconvincing. It was written by someone to whom the system is second-nature and who is trying to think retrospectively what difficulty a first-time user like Christopher should be having.    All in all, I felt the book depends on the message; \\"be nice to challenged people\\". I did not feel I was transported into an Autistic/Aspergic mind.    PS: The comments on the Search Inside back flap here at Amazon talks about Autism; yet the back cover of *my* paperback edition refers to Aspergers Syndrome! So which is it? The book itself does not say. Is there a difference? Does the author know?
B0007OCG56|4.0|Spanglish is a film that would be more enjoyable for viewers who have learned to speak a second language or have moved from one country to another, because most of the funny moments are generated from culture clash and language barriers. This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, and he's doing good taste humours here like he did in Punch Drunk Love. The cast is superb in this film, especially Paz Vega(Sex and Lucia) who managed to deliver a wonderful, funny, and dramatic performance as a overly protective single mother(Flor Moreno) working as a housekeeper for the Clasky family.<br /><br />Tea Leoni is very impressive as the comic relief most of the time. She plays Deborah Clasky, a fulltime mom and she's obsessed with exercise and when she became discontended with her husband John(Sandler), she started to cheat on him. She's quite a neurotic case, and only her mother(Evelyn) can fully understand her and gives her good advice. Evelyn is a witty ex-jazz singer and an alcoholic, and she was wild and promiscuous in her younger days. John is a workaholic/renowned chef and restraurant owner. He is trying his best to be a good dad and husband. His daughter is overweight and very self-consious about it, and she befriends with Flor's daughter Cristina(played perfectly by the bilingual Shelbie Bruce) who served as a translator for her mother most of the time. The several months of working for the Clarsky, Flor's life and her relationship with her daughter had reached a volatile state. She feared changes and she resented her daughter for becoming so Americanized.<br /><br />This film is funnier in the first hour, and then it headed a melodramatic direction that intended to build up a touching and meaningful ending. Some of the deleted scenes will provide some clarity on certain \\"unfinished\\" scenes. The special feature also included some brief interviews on the leads. I was surprised that Paz Vega didn't speak any English before starring in this movie. Her character actually learned to speak English later in the film, but it's exaggeratted that she could learn so much over the course of one summer.lly learned to speak English later in the film, but it's exaggeratted that she could learn so much over the course of one summer.
B000002UJQ|5.0|As an English music fan browsing through Amazon.com, I was actually quite surprised to find that Radiohead are so big in America. And, having read through the last review that has been posted, I feel compelled to add my opinion. Nick is quite right in saying that 'OK Computer' deserves it's extra half star. There is little that irritates those of us who appreciate Radiohead's music more than people who claim it is 'Boring' or 'Depressing', simply because all they're used to hearing is meaningless pop. Of course, though, everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I wouldn't ask you to change your mind before explaining my case. Before talking about the album generally, I'll briefly descrive each of the tracks. <br /> <br />1: AIRBAG is an unusually upbeat track for the band, and tells the story of surviving a car crash. Thom Yorke's voice may be wailing away as usual, but the emtions it deliberately conveys are elation and relief. A nice starter. <br /> <br />2: PARANOID ANDROID is easily one of my favourite tracks on the album. At six minutes this a miniature epic in itself, beginning with some fairly opaque lyrics set to a dysfunctional-sounding, mechanical beat, building to an angry loner's noisy protestations, and finally settling down into a beautiful, spine-tingling hymn, ending only when Yorke finally proclaims, full of quietly ironical bitterness, that 'God Loves His Children'. Amazing. <br /> <br />3: SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK ALIEN provides some much-needed light relief following the apocalyptic conclusion of 'Paranoid Android', perfectly matching a slow, relaxing beat to futuristic, floating melody.  <br /> <br />4: EXIT MUSIC was written for the tragic finale of 'Romeo and Juliet', and as you would expect the down-beat character is perfect for the band. The song begins almost painfully quietly, but by barely-noticeable degrees builds up to a stunning climax. When Yorke delivers the line 'We hope that you choke', it is delivered with such passion that you really believe he means it, and the way in which the crowd-noise drowns out his final, futile protest is perfect. A slow-burner, but a track you'll grow to love. <br /> <br />5: LET DOWN is still a little bit of a mystrey to me, even after the number of times I've listened to the album. What is certain is that this is an extremely complicated and technically skilful song, and another one that you wont get bored of quickly. <br /> <br />6: KARMA POLICE is one of the better-known songs on the album, and is very easy to get into. Perhaps as much as any other track, 'Karma Police' tells the sad tale of humanity dehumanized by machines that characterises the album. For once the lyrics are easily decipherable, and somehow the repetetiveness of the song is a hypnotic selling-point rather than a hindrance.  <br /> <br />7: FITTER HAPPIER forms an interlude near the middle of 'OK Computer', and though a lot of people skip over it, it is well-worth a listen. It consists of an emotionless, electronic voice listing a seemingly endless list of things that modern life tells us we should aspire to, and by the end of the track Radiohead's comment on the alien emptiness of many such aspirations is clear. The haunting piano music in the background only emphaises its effects. <br /> <br />8: ELECTIONEERING is partly based on the band's own election-style quest to popularise their work, but much more importantly it is one of the most concise and brilliant critiques of contemporary politics and protest in existence. The pace and unusual (For Radiohead) energy of the track brings a riot to mind, and Yorke's grinding vocal 'It's just business, cattle prods and the IMF' let's us know just where he stands. An excellent song.  <br /> <br />9: CLIMBING UP THE WALLS seems to have been written with insanity in mind, and the singer's unhuman screams towards the end of it certainly conjure up images of an asylum. It has also been described as Radiohead's scariest track, and I would certainly agree with that. Threatening and ominous throughout, and with a great guitar finale to match. <br /> <br />10: NO SUPRISES symbolises the meaning and soul of the album in a way that no other song ever could, and again is one of the best tracks on the album. After the heavy, dramatic lyrics and music of 'Climbing up the Walls', the contrast could not be greater; played predominantly on a toy glockenspiel, 'No Surprises' in deceptively simple. Quiet, mesmerising and incredibly depressing, it begins with the line 'A heart that's full up like a landfill' and goes on to paint a picture of a man who has utterly lost the will to fight the banal horrors of modernity. <br /> <br />11: LUCKY often reminds me a bit of 'Airbag', but this is no insult to either. Both seem to me to speak of liberation, survival and emancipation, and after 'No Surprises' it's just what the album needs.  <br /> <br />12: THE TOURIST is a good track, but nonetheless probably my worst from this album. Even so, it is a calm and haunting ending to 'OK Computer'. <br /> <br />Overall, this is, in my opinion, the best album ever made, or at least that I have heard. No other work that I have heard has quite summed up the feelings of despair and frustration that the modern world can bring about in thinking people, both in it's exquisitely written, realised and delivered lyrics and progressive, imaginative and original music. If I have one criticism it is that I would have ended it without 'The Tourist', but this is only a minor thing. If you don't own this album, buy it. I guarantee if you really listen to it a few times, you'll fall in love.  <br />
0596007124|5.0|This is probably the best book anybody could have ever read on the topic. I'm glad that I bought this book. I also have 'classic' GoF book but having bought this one there is hardly any reason to look back on to the GoF book. C++/Smalltalk examples and boring paragraphs of texts? Not anymore!. If you are Java developer, just buy this book. Highly recommended.
