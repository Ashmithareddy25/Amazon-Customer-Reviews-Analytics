0385367783|5.0|How could anything read by Jeramy Irons not be fasinating but add that to Paulo Coelho's amaizing writing and the only thing better would be in person.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bought this so I could make calls and text while driving. It connects to your phone thru Bluetooth.  So anything you can do with your phone you can do with this speaker phone. I use a iPhone so I just press the button and I tell suri what I want to do read a text send a text make a call, play music. Works great. Normally goes about two weeks before the battery runs down.  A quick plug in and it's ready to go again in no time.  It also can stand the Texas heat and does not melt.  Great product. Have recommended it to several family members. Price is low but it's worth more! Easy to use, good volume, start using in no time!
B004G0SJU8|5.0|One of Nicolas Cages better movies.  Great movie that is simply enjoyable to watch.  Has a interesting story line also.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is amazing and inspiring<br />I absolutely love it! I efficiently recommend this book to everybody. THIS IS MY NEW FAORITE!!!
B008BM9L72|4.0|Didn't want to read these books because of all the hype but after a while thought I'd give it a go.  Enjoyed them all.  A bit predictable towards the end but still a good read.  Would read it again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the app. maybe in the future boards within boards? subboards? thanks pinterest team. the new features are great and I can find a lot of new pins.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Would not recommend for Kindle Fire. Can't even open it to play it. Unless there is a trick to opening it.
B008220BP2|4.0|Good movie that starts REALLY slow, and then picks up. It is a total love story with some Zombie action. Overall pretty entertaining but you have to suffer through the start of the movie.
0783228007|4.0|To tell you the truth I bought this dvd because I had only seen the movie on tv and wanted to see if there was more in the dvd that I might have missed because of the time frame squeezing and censorship insanity.  Not the case.  I'm sure there were additional minutes, but I didn't see them.  The script was written by Elmore Leonard though and that surprised me.  Another vehicle for Clint and not a lot of substance.  Still it is full of action and horses--t and gun sling and has a tendency to make you want to have chili and tortillas on a brisk fall evening.
B00C2PO09I|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had great visual effects and the 3D was pretty cool. Good story line that wasn't too cheesy.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|Excellent memoir that sometimes reads like a thriller, other times a literary memoir, albeit by a somewhat conceited author. Would recommend even to this who usually prefer fiction.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Too much predictability, too many instances of bad writing for me. Have they ever watched a zombie movie?!? It was entertaining, but just not that great for me.
B003XT60KO|4.0|Hazlitt takes the work of von Mises and Rothbard and distills it into an easy to digest form that still managed to impart the needed insights.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|Very good visual effects. The 3D version is awesome! DiCaprio is awesome again. Very well put together in my opinion. You will definitely enjoy it.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since it first came out.  I bought it to share with my grandchildren.  It is quality entertainment that people of all ages will enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun game for my granddaughters - so far they have not found any serious flaws in its design or execution.  Well worth the price.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I saw the Blue Sky Riders near San Diego recently, and what a great performance!  I've been a fan of Kenny's music since the 1970's, but this new material with the trio is awesome.  Even though the CD was out of stock, I was able to download the songs immediately and they have been playing in my car every week since.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. Loved it. I would recommend this to everyone. Man or women. However, I would not recommend reading the epilogue, as it diminishes the characters and the wonderful book. That should have be left out.
0060989157|5.0|More evidence that rock stars are utter, utter cretins. Motley Crue don't even come across as human. Not many people died in the space of this book, but the book makes you wish many more had suffered terrible deaths. You've got to read this; it will make you feel you are more intelligent than you really are -- or at least make you feel way, way more intelligent than the members of Motley Crue. It might also make you feel homicidal.
0060935464|5.0|Sure, I read this in high school years ago when it was required. And back then I remembered liking it and thinking it was primarily about racism. However, when I read it recently, I realized some things: 1) the writing is amazing 2) racism is only a tiny part of what's going on in this book--it's about a family and a girl growing up more than anything 3) the characters are great 4) I have a new favorite book and darn it, I wish she would have written more.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, treat yourself to something amazing. If you have read it, re-experience it and be amazed.<br /><br />Publisher: stop fighting the storm and put books like this on e-book already. Come on, haven't you already made enough money on this one?
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It certainly didn't function at the same level as the book-- so expect something completely different.  Excellent special effects, pacing of the action, dialogue, acting--- all that was good.  It ended up being an enjoyable 2 hours-- yet the final comment was-- &#34;won't need to see it again.&#34;
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I got this for the grandkids, I know they will like it, I like it also But they make it too easy for the kids to accidently download the pay for version.
0312370849|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read but be warned: it is very sad but I loved it
B00EHMG358|4.0|I am a big fan of these authors, this was a great teaser, though I must say this particular book seems to be a lot different than the rest of the Pendergast Novels. I am looking forward to reading the full book since I am a avid fan.
0061719544|5.0|Craig ferguson is brutally honest and forthright. This is a great book. Easy to read and interesting on each page

B002GYS1FO|5.0|Tis is a little known band but the people who aren't listening to this CD are missing out on great music
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Twists and turns with enough details for the intelligent reader. Entertaining in the Lee Child world. Just the right length.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|I love this movie.  It was a fabulous price, came quickly, packaging was good too.  No issues with anything and it made a great gift.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times I've seen this movie, the acting is great and I never tire of it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really liked it because of all of it's fairy tale why because it had the magic ball and other different magical things.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed it. I'm too tired to compose a lengthy write-up. Just give it a whirl. it was funny, quirky, and enjoyable.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. If you are not into gore, no worries, this movie has almost no gore! It's non stop action and has an amazing ending! Highly recommended!
0449911357|5.0|I love this book.  I have read it about half a dozen times.  I encourage anyone to listed to it on cd as well.  It's read by the author, and she adds so much to the story.  I really enjoy the way she writes.  She has written several other books, which I have also read and liked. She has a very engaging writing style, conversational-it's as if she's sitting at my kitchen table with a hot cup of coffee telling me a story.  Try another one of her books, they don't disappoint.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I love baseball movies and I love Clint Eastwood.  This is a great combination.  Another interesting look at another aspect of the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I like the way the book was put together, kept me guessing.  Sometimes a perfect looking life isn't what it seems to be from the outside.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Although seemed like a victorious story, it was inspiring.gave me a different opinion about german movies. its always about Nazi and their propaganda made for evil. this movie was different.understood what is north face means....loved the way the director has made the mountain climbing into such a dramatic and commercial movie...loved it.great work !!! Inspiring, will power, immortality.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Movie has brilliant colors the movie itself has beautiful birds. My kids love this movie they watch it all the time. I bought this movie for my nephew I know he is going to love it too!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i like it but i hate you have to pay for more coins just to keep playing. it is fun.
B003EY62II|5.0|Love this movie. It's a great movie, the kids love it. Good clean family fun. My girls watch it repeatedly, they never get tired of it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Very upbeat song one of those you cant get out of your head. Is an excellent song for exersise class
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would highly recommend this book!  Definitely better than the movie and I can't wait to read the second book in the series!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it. There is a ton of content, in fact I think I will have to watch it again to really get the full effect. This was a very entertaining movie.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Couldn't wait for this book to come out and after finally getting around to reading it, it didn't disappoint. Love James Dashner's writing and this book was just as good as the previous Maze Runner trilogy. A good wrap up for the books, and if you haven't read the Maze Runner books, you should really get on that. They're great!
0345530578|5.0|On time delivery & just as expected all of these books are great. This one was too. Stupid you have to have a certain amount of words to rate something
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|My eight year old daugther loves this game.She likes everything about it! She thinks it's a very good game and would like to share it with her friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend told me to join Prime on Amazon, and to watch this. I waited six months, and it too less than two weeks to finish all seasons! I am hooked! This is the good stuff. The characters come alive and you know them well. The acting is the best! It is a very special story , and you can only share it with another person that is just as passionate with Downton Abbey!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have spent hours playing this game. My only problem is that sometimes it kinda sticks and doesn't jump or slide or turn when I swipe the screen, and sometimes it turns when I want to jump or jump when I want to turn. It doesn't happen often and it may just be my kindle sticking. Nevertheless, I have enjoyed this game almost as much as my kids have enjoyed it.
B000G73U5Y|5.0|I feel like I have discovered new music.  The &#34;Definitive Collection&#34; is superb.  I feel like I'm front row at a Steely Dan concert at the Orpheum in Omaha, NE, when the music's rockin'.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I had it downloaded on my phone and on my kindle. On my kindle, it kept popping up and saying that it wasn't working; do I want to wait for it to respond or force it to close. Almost every time, I chose force close. A few minutes later, it would pop up again. I finally just uninstalled it from my kindle. On my phone, it ran the battery down super quick. I ended up uninstalling it from my phone too. It was neat and fun while it lasted and if it wouldn't run my battery down so fast, I would re-install it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I could not put this down. Started out classic Mitch. Fast paced with many reasonable twists. Opens the door to a better rounded persona for Mitch and potentially sets the stage for a new and exciting character.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This game is awesome a little difficult to navigate through the scenes but great<br />The graphics for this pin ball game are sweet and well thought out right down to the original sounds
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|its really fun and has multiple sharks<br />but don't buy bite upgrade because it is just so useless it hurts
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!  Installed for almost a year with NO problems.  Always loads correctly and works without issues.  Definitely recommend to Kindle Fire owners.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|This is a very well done game for PS Vita owners. Nice graphics and great game play.<br />I would recommend to other PS Vita owners.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Kept me guessing, found the characters very likeable, and was hoping they would come through in the end.<br />Very well written.
B00915G6R6|5.0|Fantastic.  I am the type person who cannot keep up with the weekly serials on TV.  Having this set available to me ao that I can watch it at my own pace  brings me a great deal of enjoyment in watching this fantastic program.  Thank you.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Steven writes in the most accessible manner to bring across powerful principles. Simple universal truths are illustrated without the arrogance of being excessively verbose - the book can be read in under a couple of hours and hits home.
B003QSEYQY|3.0|This too cute to be true story of a family that adopts 99 Dalmatian puppies after their brush with a crazed clothing designer is always good to keep the kiddies entertained. For the adults there are the comical performances by House star, the Weesley dad from HP, and Glen Close rounding out the humorous villains that kidnap the cute and cuddle puppies. All in its fun to watch the silly naive adult that get shown up by the smart organized animal parent tree in this film.
141659521X|4.0|I did not order Valdez is coming.  I have not received nor read The Quest and Never go Back.  The others were rated according to my pleasure.
030758836X|2.0|Please note, I've kept specifics pretty dim as to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" was probably the single most recommended book to me this summer. And, in a summer where I have read books voraciously, I knew I could slip through the almost 400 page book with ease.<br /><br />The story is simple enough, a girl named Amy who mysteriously vanishes as told in a dichotomic prose: one being Amy's diary which starts some years before the vanishing and one being Nick (Amy's husband) telling a first person prose beginning the day of the vanishing. Each chapter changes the vantage point and further propels us into regarding Nick as a sort of duplicitous dweeb with no perspicacity and some serious daddy issues, and Amy as a unilateral vision of ubiquitous politesse that would lead any person to a kind of adulation. This juxtaposition moves through the first 200 or so pages of the book with a tacit foreboding of things to come; a somber caution that the next page may be the confession of a horrible crime. Unfortunately, the stark contrast in this first half is so abundant that it leads to somnolence. On more than one occasion I almost stopped this book, and this is coming from a guy who managed to read \\"Infinite Jest\\" last month. The book even tries to assuage this feeling of boredom by including anecdotes about Amy's parents (successful children's book writers who call their books \\"Amazing Amy\\" all the while making a furrow in our minds when they say the book wouldn't sell anymore because Amy went bad or some such harbinger.\\"<br /><br />Then, at the exact midpoint of the book: subterfuge. That tacit feeling you carried through the first half that something would alter your perception of these characters HAPPENS; but it doesn't happen through nuance or subtle cadence, it happens like a sledgehammer landing in the face of the reader with open depredation. The midpoint is such a derision that the book hailed by so many feels like a blasé Dean Koontz mystery, except we have no protagonist left to laud; just two people wrapped in their own solipsism.  But I would not let this disparage me! I've seen stories pull themselves up by their own bootstraps in the third act! I would not fainaigue this tome that others had rapt in with avidity! Though, I would enter with a cautious sense of dubiousness knowing that the exordium usually mirrors the end; but, keep in mind I held no rancor toward Gillian Flynn, and I had faith that she had the wherewithal to complete this book well.<br /><br />And I sit through one of the character's diatribes about how they supplicate their innocence and damn their decadence; And I sit through one of the character's diatribes as they rant in enmity and spew incantations about their own auspicious profundity that, like a bond villain explain their ingenious evil plans and even say \\"I'm quite pleased with myself.\\"<br /><br />This goes on for a while: One character figures things out and feels stupid; the other character goes all braggadocio about how smart they are and, consequently, how stupid the reader is, how they have moved to their own apotheosis all the while evolving into a nefarious, heartless, wretch.<br /><br />I read the conspiracy theories, the reasoning behind not going to cops (again reminiscent of a banal Dean Koontz thriller,) and the solidification that the end is nigh, all while assuming that a deus machina will come and save the day.<br /><br />Are there likable characters? Sure! There's the loving sister, Margo; the better-call-Saul of woman killer lawyers, Tanner Bolt; they do seem somewhat ancillary and superficial on the page, though.<br /><br />Then comes the game of cat and mouse. One good turn deserving another and so on with pointed vexation, pointed reciprocity, malicious manipulation and malcontent. Characters so disgusting and vile that you literally have a hard time imagining their existence; kicks in the teeth of the reader now only meagerly rooting their hero. Thebook definitely has foibles of substance, slighting to the lowest common denominator, begging to be adapted to a movie...which I think it is.<br /><br />All this leads up to an extremely benign third act, leaving one with a sense of \\"golly gee\\" or maybe \\"wow, the pretentiousness.\\"<br /><br />But I'm here to show some sort of recommendation, so here it is:<br /><br />If you read books voraciously, like me, and like to be intellectually challenged and find nuanced stories and beautiful characters: avoid this book; despite its interesting way of telling a story, the story itself becomes immensely dubious and the characters end up dull.<br /><br />If you only read mysteries, read this book; It has twists and turns and sinuous paths.<br /><br />If you only read one book a year, read this book; it's over 400 pages long and that should impress your friends and leave you convincing yourself that you actually read.<br /><br />If this book is recommended to you, be wary of the person recommending.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This movie is dizzying. It has so much alluring cinematography all packed in, you cant quite rest your eyes for more than a minute. It's hard to figure out the plot and where its going. May have had potential. It was way too drama and not enough getting to know the characters. Shame it was not an enjoyable watch.

B0061S073A|2.0|I have an 11 year old special needs child. She is very good with technology and while her tablet is a great educational tool, it also opened up a world where she could too easily get into trouble (such as buying apps despite setting PINS, etc to prevent that). So, I installed Kid's Place - seemed like the ideal solution until she realized that there was about a 5 second delay after the tablet was turned on before Kid's Place would take over. So, she would just click into settings during the delay and uninstall kids' place. Creative problem solving to be sure, but not so good in the \\"doing what mom said\\" category. Currently she has lost tablet privileges until I can find a better tool. Unfortunately I thought I had found the solution in the MMGuardian app, but now it even has me locked out of her tablet every 15 minutes - I will write about that later in another place.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|I read Outview several weeks ago, and went straight into the second book in the trilogy \\"Outin\\".  Both books are outstanding, and I will be ordering the third book in the series as soon as it is available.<br /><br />I thought that Outin was even better than [[ASIN:0988178532 Outview (The Inner Movement) Book 1]], due mostly to the direction the author took in the story line. The characters that I enjoyed in Outview were developed even further in Outin, which develops the reader's interest and adds to the drama of the book.  Legg has a knack for describing scenes and locations in a manner that allows the reader's imagination to picture them without detracting from the pace of the book.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Outin, and I have already loaned my completed books to several friends, who also loved them.  Great books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Needed a calculator on my Kindle Fire HD. Saw this free one, downloaded and installed in no time. What more can I ask for, works great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. It is amazing fun.I play it a lot it is the best game ever from your best loving friend Ilene the end
B0039YZPZ4|4.0|I am admittedly not familiar with the Sherlock Holmes novels, but I have seen the excellent BBC series.  That treatment is set in a modern day London, so it was quite nice to see an equally well executed version of the characters in a late-1800s London.  As always, it's nearly as fun to see that past era recreated as it is to see a story unfold within it.<br /><br />It's easy to imagine this material in that setting turning out stuffy and slow, but it really doesn't.  The pacing and action are in line with what today's audiences expect, and they are executed very well.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is probably the best pinball game I have found so far in my travels along the interwebs.  Very entertaining and I can not wait for more tables to open.
B000YJ6736|5.0|This book is like a painting of the gap between interior and exterior.  Ian McEwan has drawn an amazing picture of two individuals who could not bridge that gap in time and therefore could not bridge that gap over time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have a teenaged granddaughter that recommended I read this book.  Although very sad to think about, it is a beautiful story of love and friendship.  It also brings home the importance of support gained from others suffering as we are.
B00190N4E4|4.0|Gandhi stirs the hearts and minds of people from around the world.  First the people in South Africa, then to his homeland of India, then to the world. Gandhi finds himself and his fellow Indians being discriminated against in South Africa, treated like second class citizens or really last class citizens.  He starts out a lawyer and ends up a leader.  An unlikely leader, a passive man, a nonviolent man that united people to his cause.  People united that seemed unlikely partners, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others came together to help put an end to discrimination in South Africa.  It seemed like an impossible task that became a reality.<br /><br />Once returning to his homeland of India, he thought about pursuing his lawyer career once again, but realized that he was called for a greater purpose.  People around him wanted to attack the problems of his people with violence, while he persuaded them to attack the British rule with nonviolence and non compliance.  The goal was to free India of British rule, but this was not an easy task and did not happen overnight.  Gandhi hoped to unite all religions together in a peaceful, nonviolent coexistence.  He became a symbol of unity to his countryman, a symbol of peace and change.<br /><br />His leadership came in the form of poverty, of humbleness and of perseverance. He often ended up in jail for civil disobedience along with his followers.  He called upon all Hindus and Muslims to unite in an effort to bring independence to India.  Through the course of time and through a massacre and thousands of arrests for a peaceful, nonviolent change, change did happen.  Changed happened at a high cost though. The country was divided into Pakistan and India, separating Muslim and Hindu.  Muslims and Hindus reared up against each other in violence and there was a great hatred that arose between the two religions.  Gandhi went on yet another fast and prayer in hopes of uniting the countryman once again.<br /><br />After much violence, the people made vows of peace.  Millions revered Gandhi as a national spiritual leader and followed his peaceful nonviolent ways and brought about Indian Independence from Britain and a coexistence with Muslim and Hindu alike.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my 5th grade granddaughter.  We had a wonderful discussion after I read it about the story.  Very thought provoking and, I think, would help someone identify some beliefs in life and the hereafter.  Think it should be followed up with discussion for young readers.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I was worried there would be too much &#34;gore&#34; for me in this show, but was happy to find out that was kept to a minimum.<br />Just enough to get the point across, though.  Sweet story, fun movie night movie to watch.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|First of all, the storyline and premise for this novel are creative and compelling. I grew to feell compassion for the characters, but felt the story could have been told just as well (better perhaps) with fewer words. In particular, the middle of the book needed some 'pruning'--I found myself jumping through sections of Victoria's self-deprecating internal dialogue. Parts of the book grew tiresome and somewhat unrealistic--forgiveness has it's boundaries after all. That being said, the author does a beautiful job immersing herself in the lead character's struggles, and the flower theme was creative and an interesting sub-theme. I'll definitely think of this book the next time I pick up a bouquet of flowers, but beyond that, it will not be memorable.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Disappointing.  Took bits from other films and pieced them together to make this awful movie.  Ripped off the best moments of ST2

0312944926|1.0|I'm no cryptographer, but many years of computer experience. The nonsense computer stuff is just the beginning. He also gets Spain and Spanish wrong, completely distorts Catholicism, misuses basic English vocabulary. Chapter 1: if you want to get to the Smoky Mountains from Maryland, which way do you head? North, of course! Genius mathematician wonders if you see the same stars in Spain as in Maryland. This author is no genius. He doesn't even know it's 6 o'clock in Spain when it's noon in Maryland. And much more. This is the worst kind of TV shoot-em-up spewed onto paper. Why did I read this after I had already been grossed out by factual errors and historical distortion in Angels and Demons and prejudice in Da Vinci Code?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book, we need to follow the message! Highly recommend friends to take the time and read this one!
B006M4F67A|4.0|it's fun, I play lots of Mahjong and I like having it on my tablet. It is just a little small.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I have not read a YA book before.  As an author or adult paranormal mysteries I must admit I did not think I would find YA books interesting.  I was so wrong and my deepest apologies to Sheryl and all YA authors.  I received this book in exchange for a fair and honest review.  I started reading Beyond Bridalveil Falls yesterday and I did not put it down until it was finished.  It's craftfully written, as the author takes you along a journey into a world of shapeshifters, native folklore and magic.  Follow the journey or Oria, the Golden Queen, her beloved Grey Wolf and all their friends as they battle the ultimate evil that threatens to destroy their world.  This is a book that would easily be enjoyed by readers of many genres, not only YA!<br />I am so thrilled to now have a copy of the the sequel, Beyond Oria Falls and I will be delving into that one very soon!<br />Congratulations Sheryl Seal on an amazing novel!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Clean Master has really helps keep control of the stuff the Kindle Fire keeps without your knowledge. It makes it easy to delete cached files and to stop unneccessary processes from running without digging into the apps folder and stopping them manually one at a time.

B007BVOEPI|4.0|All the good things in a series with the stunning cinematography.  I recommend this med-evil show and if I were Roger Ebert, I would give 2 thumbs up.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|After trawling a few finally found my brand. There may be better players in the paid apps but this has everything I need, no annoying download limitations like free Beyond Pod and really easy to use. Ads aren't too intrusive either. Top notch!
B009CF3MEK|2.0|. . . but I watched again to see what the newest version(L.DiCaprio) may have offered; Lurhmann's production was flashier and even &#34;gaudier and grimier&#34;, as if excess need the help, which probably sold the story to movie-goers and readers of the F.Scott Fitzgerald book . . . sadly neither time did the story interesting me or hold my attention.  There were even some scenes that were shot-for-shot the same cinematic up-tick from book-to-screen.  That having been said, there are lots of watchers or for the matter, readers, who would disagree and they should as I represent an audience of one for whom it didn't work.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I really loved this book. A simple story of faith and finding ones place in life at an older age. Or maybe remembering who he was because he had forgotten. Either way a beautiful journey.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Its amazing We are seeing that good guys are bad and bad guys are good and all have feelings.  enjoyable show<br />Same review  what can I say its good
B002LANLDK|4.0|Can't wait for the new ones to come out, have been watching for them at red box and amazon. Amazon has it for sale, but not for rent yet.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I do not remember this movie being released in my area but for some strange reason only known in the movie industry that is not unusual for the great Anthony Hopkins films.  I bought when I received an e-mail advertisement and was not expecting a lot.  The quality of the entire production was original art as opposed to a &#34;turn the crank and out pops a movie&#34; product.  A deceptably deep story filmed in an awesome location.<br /><br />Bob Axsom
B003MYYJD0|4.0|What a nice watch! The black really makes the good pop out.  It is a big watch with some weight to it but after a couple of days of wearing it, I got used to it.  I love this brand and i get many compliments on both my Invicta watches. I don't give it 5 starts because the buckle does not lay flat against the band and the back of it and pokes my wrist. It is anoying more than it is painful but other than that, it is just what I wanted.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|I liked this book quite a bit. Richard Dawkins eloquently explains his point, with plenty of evidence to back it up. He makes it easy for lay readers to understand his concept. Unfortunately, his tone throughout the book is snide and full of contempt toward anyone who does not share his point of view; even though I agree with his conclusions he could have done it in a more civil manner. For the strength of the informational content, I recommend this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A very real story off young love and young loss. Gritty antitrust with beautiful language that captures you in these pages and steals your tears. A great read for anyone who is alive.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This  is one of a kind game. I'm constantly downloading new games in hopes to find that can't pull myself way feeling. I have finally found it. Dh4 is worth the download you won't be disappointed!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Perfect app to use for day to day home repairs and improvements. It comes in so handy and makes jobs easier and more accurate. I used it today to help me determine the spacing between pictures I was hanging. It is so much easier to see the output in the same format as the tape measure as opposed to decimels.
B00F35BV64|1.0|\\"Spock we're talking about your life!!!!\\"<br /><br />If I didn't know Chris Pine's work better( bottle shock) I'd think he totally sucks!!!<br /><br />What a waste.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|The characters are what make this an excellent read. The writer makes his characters real people, with good hearts and good intentions, but still flawed. The book could be a little descriptively grusome, but what good murder mystery isn't. The interaction between Kenzie and Gennaro just pulls you in, just waiting to see what happens next. Once I started this series, I just had to read the next one! I am so hoping for another one.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is a great app for cleaning things that you don't need on your device. Clean Master cleaned my device in less than a few minutes. The things Clean Master cleaned were things I didn't even know I had on my device.
B0093H8HXS|4.0|I USED THIS FOR A HTPC BUILD MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THAT PURPOSE, WITH STAND ALONE VIDEO CARD.I DID NOT GIVE IT A 5 STAR BECAUSE I HAVE SYSTEM WITH AN I5 3570K.

B000OSC3GM|4.0|It would have been better in color but some of the things going on in this movie seems like todays headlines. Show how little the political climate has changed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The reputation of the estate is all important at all costs according to the story. Makes it a contrast to many raised in the USA.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|this book was a wonderful Grisham thriller, full with plots and twists. I pretty much read in in one setting. Grisham always knows how to keep you wondering about his characters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|a really good book. an unsuall story, interesting plot, suspense, and very original ending. its definately a worth while read !
B004M5AOGY|4.0|The most difficult part about writing this review was titling it.  \\"Hereafter\\" is about people who must suppress their feelings because the world can't understand their experiences. They are looking to understand as well.  This is a subtle, quiet, well drawn story from Clint Eastwood.  \\"Hereafter\\" refers to the main characters' near death and psychic experiences.  Matt Damon and Cecile de France create two very likable characters who live on different continents but eventually meet in Europe.  Their meeting is facilitated by a young boy whose personal loss is soothed by Matt Damon's psychic skills.  There are no explosions or car chases, but the wrath of a tsunami early in the movie is dramatically and amazingly illustrated.  The cinematography is stunning, but the film seems to remain in blues and greys and though the movie is not sad, it is perhaps too subdued for some audiences.  Even the warm and hopeful ending is fitted within this restrained palette. As I imagine the story beyond the end of the movie, after the two main characters fall in love, the golden rays of sunlight splash through the window in the morning!  The soundtrack perfectly illustrates and supports the film--beautiful, but oh so restrained.  Just a little red and orange and another chord to the music could add another note to the film.  I would like to encourage viewing of \\"Hereafter.\\"  I really do like it, and it is very well done.  I believe that being prepared for the utter restraint of the movie may make you more patient during it.  The story is resolved very well.  Perhaps delay dessert after dinner to midway into the movie...a little jolt to your system may balance your viewing of this really good movie.
0062238868|5.0|Type A all the way. There are only a few who can live they way these guys live. All I can say is WOW!!! I have no idea how you guys can do what your do. But I am thankful you can. I recommend this book 100%
B00CTESTA8|5.0|Interesting and exciting show! You will get hooked after watching the pilot episode! Thumbs up to this amazing show! Great!
B005544V6A|5.0|Love love love suits!!! Intellectual comedy!!!  Keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Can't wait until the next episode.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Very fun and interesting read. The author keeps your attention throughout the entire book. I was sad when it was over.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great series! Wishing and hoping it never ends! Can't stop reading!! Glad there are plenty of books to keep me going!
0679720200|1.0|The book looked really old and its not even that. The book itself isn't what's described or shown. I am very disappointed. Especially for the fact that this is my first time buying a book from Amazon. Not even one star worth it!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I wasn't sure how I felt about Piper until she finally owned up to her wrong doings.  Still, a fascinating story about life inside of a women's prison.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|Still reading this (chapt 7) but wow. This book takes belief, faith, religion, science, law of attraction and puts it all into perspective. This will be a book that I read over and over again. Thank you so much for this information.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I'm not a big zombie movie fan but this one is really great!  Great storyline with believable characters.  The special effects are great but that is not the main feature. Most movies nowadays spend too much time on the special effect but this movie uses it just to enhance the story!  Totally fast pace and a must watch!
B0027MJU00|3.0|The book overall was good but at times I found myself wishing the author would hurry and get on with it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I wanted to see what all the HYPE was about....It deserved to win an Oscar......Thank goodness for the escape to USA
B002RVCD6O|5.0|The darkest and most sinister of all the HP films.<br /><br />Its easily my favorite and draws the line for the characters going from kids to young adults.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|One must overlook a few of bloody scenes, but you cannot wait to see what happens next. Once you start watching this your are committed.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Ok all so before you go and spend around $100 bucks on the headset let me give you a true tested warning.  I have been using this headset for a while and tonight it went all static even though I had it fully charged.  Also it is very heavy and uncomfortable to wear.  I normally wear a hoodie to make it more comfortable.  The wireless capability is good though and the headset has worked ok for a while but when I get all static and its uncomfortable I am thinking the best way to go for gaming headsets is a wired one. Maybe logitech makes one, Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]] I like alot of their other products but this one I have to say sorry its a NO.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's a really fun engaging game. Too many glitches and failure to load enemy bases. Some enemies have hacks that make them way to powerful in defense and attack. I'm working through the glitches in hopes they can fixes these quicker so I can enjoy the game but I won't spend anymore money for gold stars till my lost<br />stars are refunded.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Hilarious. I could not stop watching. Something about a group of awkward high schoolers that makes you remember when you were there age.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Overexposed (explicit) is a great group of songs on 1 cd; many of them have been played on local radio stations.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I thought the story was great but you have to start from the beginning otherwise it might not make sense or could be confusing
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Misdirection, stealing from corporations, just all over fun to watch! Isla Fisher and Jesse Eisenberg were a great pair,<br />Woody Harrelson is always good and I'm starting to like the Franco kid.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Great characters and excellent fact based fiction. Ending was good, not great.... but it will make you want to read another book.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I love Waine, loved Cann in this movie, and the Swede is the one who did the painting during the opening credits.<br />The story is typical western: struggle between good and evil, but the twist with the guy who does not know how to use a gun, and the girl that does is interesting. Also, thegirl who shoots the hero in the begining, also... Sorry, do not want to spoil it for you. Watch it!!!
0062255657|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Fascinating characters, compelling story, heart-tugging prose.  I encourage everyone to read this book!
B002KYXO7A|5.0|What's not to like in this movie.  Some of the best dancing, singing and acting I've ever seen.  It has everything I love in a movie: romance, great actors, beautiful people, great dancing and the songs stay in my head for days after watching it.
0385368283|5.0|I've been staring at my computer screen for over an hour, because I don't know how I can possibly tell you how much I loved this book. All I feel like doing is yelling from the rooftops: \\"READ THIS BOOK! OR ELSE!\\"<br /><br />How am I supposed to properly convey to you what I feel about this book? How am I supposed to tell you that I completely fell in love with it, because it was one of those books that made you feel all gushy and tingly inside? How am I supposed to tell you that this book is one of my all time favorites?<br /><br />How am I supposed to say all of that in a simple review? I guess I could tell you how it didn't matter where I was, whether it was on the train, on my way to college, or studying in the library, this book never failed to bring a smile to my face. It always made me laugh out loud. It always made me want to stop whatever I was doing and just focus completely on this book.<br /><br />I could also tell you how Eleanor's voice resonated with me. How I always wanted to live inside the book and be Eleanor's best friend. How the narrator made me feel like she was sharing a secret with me. Or maybe how Park made me feel. Park's narrator was.... Breathtaking. Hearing his voice always made me feel giddy and happy.<br /><br />\\"There's no shame with Park. Nothing is dirty. Because Park is the sun, and that's the best way she could think to explain it.\\"<br />-Eleanor & Park, by Rainbow Rowell<br /><br />What if I told you all about the romance in this book? The romance in this book is slow building, and every bit as adorable as any other romance. What if I told you that this romance is probably one of the best romances I've ever read in my life?

I want to be with you all the time. You're the smartest girl I've ever met, and the funniest, and everything you do surprises me.

This book paints such a vivid image of children living in the 80's, I actually feel as if I was actually born there.

It made me want to keep this story to myself so no one else could feel what I felt. Because other than feeling like swooning every time Park spoke, or giggling every time Eleanor and him would banter, or sighing at every romantic moment, I felt like my heart was turning into a giant black hole and sucking every bit of happiness as I kept reaching the end. I didn't want anyone else to feel what I felt, but at the same time, my hands were just itching to create a review of this book.<br /><br />You know how John Green says that a book can fill you with Evangelical Zeal ?

859037985X|5.0|Dry but thorough explanation of the language and how to do various programming functions with it.  A good way to learn if unimaginative in presentation.
0670020745|5.0|As a brain injury survivor, I found this book to be a moving account of what it takes to recover your life after a traumatic injury. Through the eyes of a neuroscientist, told with an incredible amount of neuroscience background, this book is one of a kind. It offers a technical side to her entire recovery, explaining every step along the way. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in science, philosophy, or personal narratives and memoirs.

0785153942|4.0|Great background information for the movie, and the intro by Beacham really makes me want to meet the guy. I hope they do more with Luna and Tasmin in subsequent media.<br /><br />Only gripe I had was that there was just enough difference in the pictures of the characters from the movie to put me off a bit. (But that's normal for me, it may not do the same for others.)
1594202273|2.0|As others have stated, this is a critically important topic deserving of coverage better than this.  An assemblage of semi-random facts and factoids (I was building a list of the incorrect before I finally stopped keeping track) does not a coherent report make.  My impressions of this book are of a lot of transcription from references with only surface understanding hence the triumph of quantity over quality.<br /><br />The most interesting accidents were covered in flyby yet the backbone of this book is one of low profundity and consequence. Guy drops socket by accident, punches hole is big pressured thin-walled chemical tank (a.k.a missile), eventually it explodes.  No worse and a probably better outcome than most of the chemical plant accidents that happen each year.  And the nuclear aspect? Warhead blown hundreds of feet into the air by three large explosions and comes crashing to earth. The result? No detonation at all, no leakage of radioactive materials.  It is loaded onto a truck and driven away for disposal.

B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I love this game.  No annoying hidden objects that have nothing to do with the plot.  Just when you think it's about to end, there's a surprise twist and another puzzle to solve.  Didn't want to see it end.
0785168109|5.0|It's a very good book of the art of a film. Hard covers and cardboard box protect it perfectly and gives the book a great appearance.<br /><br />The interior is good. Good illustrations and the speech is not quite big. Recommended.
B0060D1B2C|5.0|Wang is a very sensitive director. I really enjoyed this movie. Such insights into the relationships between mothers and daughters, and the cultural changes they experience. The juxtaposition of the old traditions and the new ways is delicately portrayed.

1586487981|4.0|Is it that the institutions of a nation trap the poor in poverty?  Or is it that the peronsal habits of the poor prevent aid from having any impact?  It is tragic that countries fail to deliver public services to the public -- so tragic that the United States gives billions in foreign aid to help deliver clean water and health services.  But the aid does not help the poor -- in most cases, it helps legitimize the corrupt and feckless governments.<br /><br />Mistrust of imperialism, widespread corruption, intractable bureaucracies, idealistic zeal uncoupled from understanding, centralization, decentralization... all these aspects are considered in this book.<br /><br />One aspect that is NOT considered is the huge cost of public bureaucracies to the poor.  The civil service in many poor nations is the natural niche for educated and well-connected people, but the civil service is by far one of the most difficult operations to change.  This book does not look at ways to bypass the civil service, or to dissolve it and supercharge entrepreneurship rather than civil sinecure.  An entrenched civil bureaucracy is the number one obstacle to poverty eradification.<br /><br />That is because one problem with poverty is overreliance on government.  This book does not challenge that philosophy of dependence in a meaningful way.  It speaks of better optimizing government so it will be more dependable, rather than pursuing widespread independence and self reliance.<br /><br />A better book is \\"Banker to the Poor\\" [[ASIN:1586481983 Banker To The Poor: Micro-Lending and the Battle Against World Poverty]]

0312641893|4.0|3.5/4 Stars<br /><br />I started reading Cinder when I needed something lighter, and also because I'd met Marrisa Meyer like five times and still hadn't read her books. So I finally picked it up, hoping to love it because I love fairy tales and I'd heard so many good things about the book. While I think it didn't really live up to the hype for me, it was still a good book.<br /><br />I didn't really have many issues with Cinder. (Although it took me a while to get used to the font, which is not my favorite.) The writing was nice, and I enjoyed the voice, but I think hype and anticipation kind of hurt it. I think there was just something kind of missing, kind of like that Wow Factor. Don't get me wrong--I liked the book. I did. But I just don't think I loved it. Also, I was sort of waiting for something to happen. Yes, things did happen, but I wanted more (especially more scenes with Kai and Cinder together). And the POV switch-offs seemed kind of sporadic, and I would have liked a pattern to them.<br /><br />One thing I really liked was the characters and how they were portrayed, as well as being able to compare them with their originators in the original Cinderella tale. Cinder--a cyborg mechanic--was a great MC (though the book wasn't told in just her POV). She was so like Cinderella: the unwanted stepdaughter, she does all the work, etc. She has an evil stepmother (I HATED her), a not-so-nice stepsister, and a nice stepsister--which I liked. It was nice for their to be at least one person who treated Cinder kindly and showed her respect in her own home. And instead of mice for friends, Cinder had Iko, a robot-type with a wonderful personality.<br /><br />There's also a prince, who I simply adore: Prince Kai. He doesn't seem like the typical Prince Charming, though he is definitely nice to those who aren't evil, and he's stinkin' cute in my book. (Actually, him and Cinder are so stinkin' cute together.) I think that both Kai and Cinder will be big players throughout the books, and with Kai being a royal, he has great potential. Of course, there can't be any kind of fairy tale without a villain, and that would be Queen Levana. And she most definitely plays the part. I look forward to seeing what her evilness will do throughout the series.<br /><br />As a retelling, Cinder was great. It had a lot of truth and relation to the original story of Cinderella, while still managing to have its own flair and be original. It's he first book in a series (The Lunar Chronicles) that will have multiple characters from fairy tales being retold and crossing paths. I also like the world--in Cinder, we're in New Beijing, so Prince Kai is Asian. (I THINK Cinder is originally from Europe.) There's a lot of talk in the YA world right now about diversity, and if you want that, then read this series. The book is light and fun, but it's told in a way that's not all cutesy or cheesy (not that I don't like that), and it's done well.<br /><br />While Cinder may have fallen short because of hype and it was kind of predictable at parts, it was still a good book. Of course, I just wish I would've loved it. Toward the end, I was very engrossed. (I may have made noises, and my sister may have told me to \\"shut up\\" more than once.) The last few chapters are what really made me like the book, totally making me react to all that was happening. I await reading Scarlet, and seeing what more The Lunar Chronicles will bring.

B008P1EWIM|4.0|A nice way to check the weather in bed when I wake up, without having too peer outside and seeing my sour faced neighbor. Highly recommended for apartment dwellers.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The more you listen to this song, the more it grows on you.  I think it is a great start for what I am anticipating to be a great album.  Lady Gaga gives so much for her music & her fans.

B000V63AVY|5.0|Filling out my digital collection of rock. Sometimes we forget how good the older stuff really was. Worth $5 anytime!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I just &#34;binge watched&#34; this series - great fun show -  and am sorry I did. Nothing more to look forward to?
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I'm not a World War Z fan, at least I wasn't prior to watching this movie with the missus.  We decided to check it out after getting riled up by the trailer.<br /><br />The movie did not disappoint!  It was exciting and entertaining from beginning to end.  It was a pretty unique take on the battle against the zombie horde we have been inundated with this generation.  I appreciate the fresh take on the worlds response to the invasion, including the piece about the city that escaped infection by undergoing the largest social exercise every conducted - in a 24 hour period officials orchestrated the removal of every citizen's teeth!<br /><br />Check it out!  I loved it, my wife loved it, you'll love it.
B000QRIGLC|1.0|My husband called it macho bulls--t. The author goes into excruciatingly boring detail about each person in an effort to pad this story into a book, he thinks. 'Nuff said.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|This is one of my favorite western movies.  Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne are wonderful in this, and not to forget Lee Marvin.<br />Great story!
0140067477|5.0|To be honest, I am not a big \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" fan, and I was going to put this book down after the first 30 pages, but I am thankful that I kept reading.<br /><br />Benjamin Hoff does a fantastic job of explaining Taoism in an easy to read, intellectually stimulating format. In addition, even if you don't want to specifically know about Taoism there are some real pearls of wisdom in this book and the application of these concepts will definitely impact your life.<br /><br />A must read.
B000SX9IXO|5.0|This mostly Canadian band helped define what came to be known as &#34;Americana&#34;! The songwriting, singing and instrumentation on every level was superb. No wonder Bob Dylan wanted to work with them. Bruce Springsteen and many other &#34;roots&#34; artists were heavily influenced by them. A must in any music collection.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like it from the first two chapters but as I got further into it I couldn't read fast enough!  I know it is supposed to be geared to the teenage crowd but I am 61 and I have now enjoyed all five books!  Now I  am reading the clockwork series and am not disappointed.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Ending????just leaves you hanging and wanting more. Hope the is another book soon. Just waiting Sylvia give us more. Please
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written and a &#34;what to look for in a unhealthy relationship&#34; guide. Characters are inconsistent and dialog is trite. Poor representation of the BDSM community.
B008M721MS|4.0|The reason I got the Kindle Fire HD was to Skype with my friends and it works great! Love it!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|although you don't wish to have an extra battery on your backpack all the time to make sure you will be able to communicate you in deed need it. Anker is the best solution and having the peace of mind of 5 to 6 times charges with out having to leave your phone on a wall dc outlet where it can be stollen .
B008133MDK|5.0|Superb acting by Benedict and Martin and the rest of the cast! I am looking forward to season 3 and Sherlock's resurrection!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I didn't know she existed until about a month ago! Whoa - where have I been? I happen to have a Pandora station and on my ATB music station they played her and caught my attention instantly! I was mesmerized. Wish I had known about her earlier :) Every song is beautiful on that CD!
B00023B1LC|3.0|If you like violence, then this movie is for you. Lots of karate and guns, lots of techno-jargon, lots of cool military toys and plenty of good old american C.I.A. covert operations.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|a good read overall.  The author does a great job of hooking you early.  Several twists and turns with unexpected results.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The author begins by laying out, in a well written and understandable way, that much of our behavior is a product of habits we formed naturally.  Focusing first on the individual he explains how to form good habits and also how to overcome bad habits -- overeating, smoking and others.  He then focuses on small groups and how to make those more functional and finally on large organizations.  His description of the turnaround at ALCOA by focusing on worker safety is very very interesting.<br />I thought this book was a ground breaker!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|My background:  I consider myself to be generally fit.  I have worked out pretty consistently for over ten years, but my workout styles have not been consistent.  I like to change things up, both for my body and my mind because I tend to get bored with the same thing over time.  I have been lifting weights for nearly that entire time.  I have run three half marathons and done at least dozen sprint triathlons (five this summer).  I think this DVD is great for anyone at any fitness level.<br /><br />What you need:  A yoga mat and three or five pound weights.  Not to sound snobby, but I didn't own anything less than 10 pounds before I got this.  I am so glad I read the recommendation on someone else' review!  They recommended three-pound weights for beginners and five-pound weights for people accustomed to training with weights.  I got both because I found that a couple of the exercises are too hard for me with the five-pounders, particularly in the shoulders.<br /><br />Level One:  I found this to be very moderate.  It was mostly easy, save two exercises, which forced me to bump it to moderate :)<br /><br />Level Two:  This is a big step but worth it.  At first, I found this level to be HARD.  I couldn't keep up the whole time like level one, and I was pouring sweat!  After a bit more, I can keep up better, but I still find it challenging!  I use mostly the five pound weights, saving the three pound weights for the last weight section only.<br /><br />I haven't made it to level three yet, but I am looking forward to getting my butt kicked!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book, heartfelt recount of the horrors and triumphs in the US prison system. Makes you want to contact your local congress person and demand prison reform!
0470913029|1.0|In my opinion, what we do not need is one more diet that claims that restricting certain food groups is healthy.  I have to question the theory of this diet since the proponents of the Paleo diet claim it is the healthiest diet because it mimics the food groups of our pre-agricultural, hunter-gatherer caveman ancestors. Many other health experts disagree with the paleo diet as well.  Scientific articles with a diametrically opposite opinion abound in periodic journals.  It is infrequently mentioned that through evolution, as we transitioned from our original vegetarian diet, we developed the teeth of omnivores for grinding grain, pulling leaves off of stems, and eating meat.  Through evolution, we have developed long intestines, somewhere between carnivore and herbivore intestinal tracts, and a digestive system that breaks down both acidic and alkaline foods like protein, carbohydrates, and fats.<br />There are many healthy populations eating well balanced diets, including grains, around the world.  The people of Okinawa, with the highest documented population of centenarians in the world, as documented by Bradley J. Willcox, D. Craig Willcox and Makoto Suzuki.  For those unfamiliar with the above, Dr. Makoto Suzuki, is a cardiologist and geriatrician, who began the Okinawa study in 1976, sponsored by the Japanese Health Ministry.  Bradley Willcox, is a Mayo Clinic-trained internist and was a geriatrics fellow in Harvard University's Division on Aging, and D. Craig Willcox, Bradley Willcox's brother is a medical anthropologist and gerontologist who also joined the study.<br />Also, After years of world travel, fitness expert Harley Pasternak ranks the world's top 10 healthiest nations.  In his new book, \\"The 5-Factor World Diet,\\" he cites many doctors and scientists who believe that some of the world's healthiest diets include foods from many different sources.  In addition to several Asian countries who consume lots of rice, he has also found that Israel, Sweden, France, Greece and Italy are some of the healthiest countries in the world.  For example, in Pasternak's book, he cites cardiologist Richard Collins, who is also known as the Cooking Cardiologist,  who said that the Mediterranean diet is what he always recommends to his clients.  People following the Mediterranean diet eat lentils, garbanzo beans, and even small portions of homemade pasta, which is made from wheat.  Collins said  \\"The Mediterranean diet is very rich in vegetables and fruits and whole grains, lean meats and poultry, and a lot of Omega 3 rich fish.\\" \\"And if you look at the lifestyle and eating style, they balance their physical activity with their calorie intake.\\"<br />In my humble opinion, most health experts advise us to eat a diet with a variety of foods from all the major food groups, and to cut sugar and refined carbohydrates out of our diets except for an occasional celebration.  They recommend our daily diet to be composed of real whole foods in their natural state.  Fresh produce, whole grains and legumes, lean meats, and wild seafood and fish, healthy oils like olive oil, avocado oil, walnut oil, coconut oil and clarified butter (ghee). We need to watch not only the calories we take in, but also the quality of those calories.  Too much of anything, including protein, can be bad for you as some people following a high protein diet, such as the Paleo Diet, develop gout, and some people with kidney, liver, gastroparesis and other diseases are not suppose to eat a high protein diet.<br /><br />Update! I've removed the information about &Ouml;tzi,the Iceman, since I feel there is something more important to think about. It's believed that humans originated about 200,000 years ago in the Middle Paleolithic period in southern Africa.  A current fad is to eat a pre-agriculture/Paleolithic diet that was thought to be eaten about 10,000 years ago. But why select this particular age as a starting point? Why not eat the diet our ancestors ate 50,000 yearsago, 100,000 years ago, or 200,000 years ago?  Many scientists believe that our guts are most similar to monkey's and other primates. Rob Dunn, in a Scientific American article stated that \\"The majority of the food consumed by primates today-and every indication is for the last thirty million years-is vegetable, not animal.\\" As you can see, the scientists have different viewpoints.  Vegetarian or omnivore? Vegetarian or omnivore eating a high protein diet or a low protein diet. Which is it? I am not saying that I have all the answers, or any of the answers.  What I am saying is that we need to think for ourselves, and look at the current evidence from as many different perspectives as possible.  I will also say that many smart men and women of science, have drawn overly confident conclusions that turned out to be not only wrong, but glaringly wrong. Sometimes the conclusions that are drawn from the evidence are often very much exaggerated to fit personal beliefs and biases. I think that some of my critics are all-in for the Paleo Diet, and they don't want to look at this topic with new eyes., 100,000 years ago, or 200,000 years ago?

B00F91RYL8|5.0|Really liked this movie. Worried there would be too much zombie action & there.  Suspenseful not too gruesome.  Hoping for a sequel.
B00EB6F1TY|2.0|Movie was too long for the dialog; made me the audience lose focus.  Total waste of my money and time; at least with COPS you get some unpredictability.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Excellent PQ and AQ quality, what you'd expect from new source materials.  Movie is fun to watch, and the supplemental materials are terrific!
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|my review for the glow hockey app is I love it no glitches no problems at all. Fun for the fam and is great entertainment.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|What can I say? Ann Lee is one of the best directors right now and he does not miss with this film. The look of the movie is amazing the actors are amazing and over all the story is amazing. Great film. Great director.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|The Matrix is a modern cautionary fairytale, with a rich cast of characters and visual images.  Cool piece of cinema!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Good popcorn movie. The story is silly but the action is good and some of the actors make the movie wort watching.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not a crier but this book cut into me. I love this book with all my heart. If you ever get the chance to read this I highly suggest you do.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|This movie is one of the best comic movies out there. Great acting all over this film I can't believe we didn't here more about it when it fists came out.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Loved this book so much.. fast read...and loved it so much I passed it on to friends...book seller was awesome, book arrived much earlier than I expected.
0739352687|5.0|I have reading difficulties because like the main character, Percy, I am dyslexic and have ADHD. So the CD help...... a lot and because I Love Books, Hate Reading, and Love Stories this help me enjoy what I love to do!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun and addictive.  It's challenging enough to keep your attention while some of the levels are easy enough to keep you from getting frustrated.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|I really enjoyed this book as it gives you a sense of the frustration, fear, fatigue and occasional hopelessness of the war in the Pacific against an enemy that wouldn't surrender. The only reason I didn't give it five starts is that it is occasionally depressing - I actually had to put it down for a few days - but the writing style and excellent narrative put you right on the battle field with the troops of K/3/5. I feel I have a real sense of what these Marines went through - and it wasn't always pretty.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is just amazing.... GET IT IT IS AWESOME BECAUSE IT IS LIKE TEMPLE RUN OR SUBWAY SURFERS BUT WAY BETTER PEOPLE!!
B005TKC2P2|4.0|Unusual and almost poetic in style, this book by Murakami held my interest throughout, although I didn't always understand the story. Beautiful to read and believable characters. Keen to read more by this author<br /><br />Elyse Frankel<br />WA
B0045HCJIA|5.0|This movie is one of my absolute favorites. The acting is flawless and parts are played to perfection. A masterpiece.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Really compelling story. All the twists and turns and never seeing a new secret coming. Loved the book. Would recommend.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|He is just great. Love his music and his voice. This album is wonderful. Easy listening. Wonderful songs and meanings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So, everyone deserves to try this. It's not exactly worth $7, but it's close. It's a lot cheaper than buying the xbox game.<br />Pros:<br />Controls are easy, just need time to figure out<br />Includes monsters in survival<br />Allows seeds<br />Cons:<br />Little bit to expensive<br />And I can't think of anything else...<br />If you haven't tried Minecraft, TRY THIS!<br />-USED BY KINDLE FIRE HD-
B007SGM084|5.0|I got so caught up in the story that I read all three books in 5 days.  Christian Grey is such a troubled man but also extremely intense. I couldn't wait to see how it all played out.  Now I am sad that it is over.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Pretty good.  A little slow moving at first, but gets better. If you've seen the movie, they did a decent job of being accurate, but made a few major changes near the end that may surprise you.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son can't stop playing it.  He loves the Pork side!!  Hasn't stopped playing it since we got it the other day.
B0030MM68O|4.0|This movie does a great job of portraying the terrifying job of disarming IEDs as well as showing the impact of the Iraq War on Iraqis themselves. The main character is a rogue warrior who is brilliant but reckless as well as being your somewhat Hollywood-style tortured soul. He finds himself the team leader of a 3-man group who have about a month until their tour ends. His style of ignoring his teammates, disregarding safety, and seeking adrenaline has the other toe wondering if they'll make it to the end of their tour. It is a gripping and eye-opening look into the newest style of warfare: IEDs and suicide bombing.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Alwayzs a fan love Chrome so much easier. One step search using voice. My answers and results in seconds. Safe driving!
B008ZEIAYQ|5.0|This is yet another album I bought because it was on sale. This was also a pleasant surprise! I had saw a commercial of her singing &#34;Lost & Found&#34; on adult swim (I think) and had to track it down. I listened to the song samples before purchasing, and felt it could be a good album to listen to while doing weekend leisurely reading, or something like that. Instead I listened to this non-stop for the first few weeks after purchase. Her voice is intoxicating, the songs are engaging and diverse. The album flows well too. I can't stand when albums are so choppy in quality. Really wish she got some radio time and better exposure.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was funny,sad( I mean for Gregory ),and hos pain is funny.<br />I keep reading it because its so funny
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is awesome it has guns like you never seen before and its just like grand their auto iv if you like gangstar games you will like this one
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love the book. im halfway through it and can't put it down.. People should definitely read this. great series for both teens and adults
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version lets you ask for hints, take back a move and tap a card to reveal if there are any useful moves. In other words, you can \\"cheat\\" if you want too, and sometimes I do.
B00F91H666|4.0|This was a really good story. I would categorize it more as a action/adventure movie, with tons of close ups of Pitt.  As far as a &#34;zombie type&#34; movie, you don't have much interaction with zombies, or close ups of zombies. The attacks look more like a football game with people getting tackled.  I would recommend this movie to rent, especially for Pitt fans, but I'd pass on buying it.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|It was a little weird and predictable, there were good performances throughout but I would say over all a decent movie.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Loved his first two books, and hoped this one would be as good.  Unfortunately it fell short of the mark.<br />Very disjointed.  Would have liked to know more of the brother and what happened to him before he<br />got to America.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Sweet, but enticing tale. The woman character leaves a bad situation and ends up in a safe place. She is hesitant to make friends or let anyone know about her except for her friend, Jo. This movie is heartwarming, but also intriguing. Good movie to curl up on the couch and watch.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci always provides great dialogue and story lines and he does not miss a beat with this story. Fun, fast paced, believable for  a novel, and awesome characters with fun action.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Well, I like Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon. This is a story about love.  It's also a story about a 14 year old boy and his hopes about love. He sees his parents marriage disintegrating. Mud, Matthew McConaughey, is on the run, but teaches the teenager about his idea of love. Interesting setting and scenery. I definitely recommend this movie. It has some twists and turns. Pop the popcorn and have a seat and enjoy!
B007PFD90G|5.0|I ordered this for my Kindle from our library as a casual choice - not having read Rushdie other than his short stories.  It is an autobiography, really, of the most dramatic and dangerous and productive years of his life.  Once I began to read, I  could not put it down easily.  Aside from relishing all the minutiae of his life for the years of his ordeal, and admiring his ability to endure confinement, slights, and emotional trials,  I was impressed by and never shall forget the heroism of so many people in Rushdie's life.  Their willingness to stand with him for freedom of speech and literature is an inspiration to all who cherish this freedom.  The cowardly actions of the governments most concerned with his well being are not.<br /><br />It is not one word too long. Every sentence is necessary to the whole.  The format, in the third person, takes a bit of getting used to, but it's an oddly attractive device - as if Rushdie were standing aside and observing another person living a restricted and threatened life, trying to do normal things, falling in and out of love, daring to challenge authority.  I loved every page of it.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed watching this movie. Fast paced and fun. These former agents rock!  Bruce Willis is great as usual in this type of movie. Looking forward to seeing Reds 2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very good and interesting book, much better than the movie, you can not stop reading the book until the end
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator app and found this one. I was looking just for a basic one and this one just fit the bill. I love it because it is simple to use!

B00F1BFRA6|5.0|Like one of the other reviews, I, too, came across this series unexpectedly. I managed to watch the entire series on my Kindle e-reader, but ordered the box set anyway. The only problem is that the box set(series 1-3)has subtitles, which are very irritating, and no mention of them is made when viewing the item.Fortunately, I have a portable DVD player with the feature to delete subtitles.It is a truly \\"addictive\\" series,and I can't wait for the 4th series to be available, as we have been left in suspense after the death of Matthew.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great show well written violent but really great  Love Tara Gemma Jax Tig  Otto  Its different  than regulaqr series keeps your attention
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite shows. Dexter is great in it or should I say the guy who plays him. Very disappointed that the next season is the last . Would continue to watch it longer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is such a fun game. It's like temple run but easier. It gets annoying when you die and you have to start over, but that's in about every game like that. So if you don't know if you want it you should get it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Been playing it for years. It's one of my favorite games. Keeps me entertained for hours. Keeps my mind active.
B0034G4P80|3.0|This movie is like a lot today...it has ongoing special effects and delights the imagiination.  Its common entertainment for today's movie public.  We'll watch it again.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Hated the book....very depressing....I most assuredly did not expect another Harry Potter but I did expect a book that at least I could finish...she should stick to what she does best....so many more avenues she can take in the HP series by developing the other characters....I also heard they are making a movie of this book....YIKES....can't imagine anyone going to see it...except maybe people in the UK....very disappointed that's all I can say
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Something different to play.  Got through the free trial pretty quickly.  Not my usual type of game.  Good concept. OK.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|This movie is one of my new favorites and I would definitely recommend seeing this. McConaughey really nailed this one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush...  Love it, and it's free!!!  Takes some practice and I'm not too good at it yet.  My daughter showed me on her I-phone so I'm getting better.  The trick is to not keep your finger on the screen too long.  Just quick swipes.  Astounding graphics and color.  I just love the looks on their face when they crash!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Brandon Sanderson never disappoints, with his awesome imagination and powerful storytelling Sanderson brings his unique worlds to life.  I finished this book wanting more!
B009X2CRMK|3.0|But perhaps not her best book.  It was well written and beautifully descriptive, as you would expect from Kate Morton, and the plot was good and quite suspenseful but somehow it just didn't seem to be ... terrific I guess.  It was a nice read and OK.
B001K3KK0Q|2.0|Having read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" as a teen in high school, I don't remember the story being quite as boring as this movie version.  Perhaps I need to go back and re-read it?  I don't know.  What I do know is that this movie could have been done far better than it was.  The pacing of the movie was done poorly.  The first half of the movie drags then picks up steam towards the last hour or so.  While it's clear that the director tried to capture all of the wealthy, over top grandeur of the frivolous elite in the roaring 20s, it was done in a haphazard way and with not enough continuity.  It just didn't flow right.  Also, though Mia Farrow and Robert Redford were the two hot actors of the day when they were cast, they had absolutely no onscreen chemistry.  Onscreen chemistry is crucial to many love stories... it can literally make a so-so story/script or break a good one.  Though I am a Robert Redford fan (who couldn't be with those looks? lol) I don't think he fit.  Neither did Mia Farrow.  Perhaps if either of their roles were filled by someone else and there was better chemistry it would have worked.<br /><br />I haven't seen the new version with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey McGuire, but I suspect, based on reviews and the previews I've seen, that I'm in for much of the same - lol.<br /><br />Where's Ang Lee when you need him??
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app. A must if u are on a busy business travel schedule. Would make packing easy and not time consuming.. well done
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love the way she writes.I love the way she writes. Very entertaining. I enjoed it from beginning to end.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I also prefer the previous version, although I like somethings about the new one. I am sorry to hear about the battery-draining problem and hope it has been fixed, as Weather Channel is my favorite app and one I would not like to be without. I logged in today to check on the anticipated overnight temperatures, even though I was not using.my.kindle otherwise.m
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It's a Captivating read, I got thru it easily on a rainy weekend<br />Would recommend to a friend, good beach read
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I can't imagine anyone who doesn't love Tiny Fey would buy this book, so naturally I was already pre-disposed to loving it. Reading about Tina's career is like reading about the trajectory of a major athlete -- all the hard work and all the roadblocks she faced before hitting the top is more proof that success is a result of picking one's self up and trying over and over again, even more than natural talent. Furthermore, her perspective on what it takes to succeed as a female in Hollywood and the expiration date on her forehead that men do not have is something any female professional can relate to.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I can not describe what i was feeling when I was done with this book! I loved it! And I am probably going to read this book again some day!!
B0015DROBO|3.0|The translation was a little weird.  Just threw in some Swedish words as if everyone is supposed to know.  I've been to Stockholm and knew that the Tunnelbana is the subway. Does every American know that?  Many other examples.
B009IF82SK|5.0|They are so funny. My whole family watches them every night can't wait for the new season to begin. Yea!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app more than all the apps on my kindle fire hd!!!  You will surely love the app to if you like the movie!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|When I first got the game it wouldn't work . Then I thought it was a rip off so I deleted it. Several weeks later I downloaded it it worked. This is definitely worth<br />The money it is very fun!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|This is a great way to catch up on past season, always interesting and forward thinking. Makes for great conversations.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Still reading it, and will read it again. He really researched and did a wonderful job. I enjoyed it because the general public can understand it and you don't have to be an intellectual.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|An action movie with a good plot and acting...that is rare and well worth the price of a 48-hour rental.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever I love the update with the minion beach I could play all day long 5 stars defiant!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this version of solataire. My only complaint is I have had to delete and reload it a couple of times. I am not sure what the problem is.
0843132787|4.0|When Mr. Tickle returns and finds his house burned to the ground, he sets out to find out what happened. Following a path of burned out structures, Mr. Tickle eventually finds the source of all the trouble - a fire-breathing dragon! Just what can he do to overcoming this dangerous beast? Why tickle him, of course! And soon, Mr. Tickle shows the dragon all of the good things that he can do with his abilities.<br /><br />This is quite a cute little book, as are all of the Mr. Men and Little Miss books. However, I must say that it does appear to me that it this book should not be read to very young or most sensitive children. My own daughter was horrified at the idea of coming home to find your house a burned-out wreck, and found the beginning a little too scary. So, you might want to keep that in mind.<br /><br />But, nonetheless, it is a cute book, with a nice, uplifting story of helping others.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the one on the computer but this one is equally good if not better! It is so easy to figure out if you have never used it before.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I would have gave a 5 star rating before the update now after the update game play is rather a little difficult
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Beyond saying it works I find very little desire to use it much.<br />The functions are quite limited and the response seems sluggish.<br />Considering the modest cost it's a very amazing device. Perhaps the hype exceeded the results.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|good price and great service and I just love it. I was not expecting this price when I ordered. It was more at the time of order.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This is a must have book. I wish I could have read this book long back. This is a true asset. The main takeaway I got is, in order to make a better decision, I should be aware of all the biases that I might have whether consciously or unconsciously.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this book!!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|must have..easy and addictive game really enjoying it<br />hoping the new levels are added soon<br />also cheap so buy it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Collins pen a suspenseful, nail-biting conclusion to the \\"Hunger Games\\" series with \\"Mockingjay.\\" Katniss needs to assume the mantle of the \\"Mockingjay\\" to give Panem's rebellion a chance at success, but what will it do to her soul?<br /><br />Katniss recovers from the Quarter Quell games after being saved by the rebellion leaders who are aligned with District 13, but she's damaged - physically, mentally, and emotionally. As she recovers, she adapts to life in District 13 where her mother and Prim live, too.  Her friend, Gale, is a major leader in the rebellion, but it's not until Katniss learns that the Capital has Peeta does she agree to become the rebellion's Mockingjay.<br /><br />Katniss will play her role to the best of her ability, but she is constantly watched by President Coin of District 13, who consistently reminds Katniss that her role is only that for a figurehead.<br /><br />When Katniss and her squad penetrate the Capital, the action and suspense build to a pulse-pounding pace. Can Panem finally defeat the evil that rules its society and do away with the Hunger Games for good?<br /><br />Collins is easy to read. She captures the nuances of Katniss' emotional torment with finesse, reminding the reader the turmoil that war plays on the human psyche.<br /><br />The best part of the novel was the characters. Despite Katniss' emotional angst, she saves Buttercup, the cat, for Prim, a noble gesture indeed since Katniss can't stand the animal. Gale's focus remains firmly on the rebellion, while Haymitch and Finnick's motivations are tempered by those they care for. Coin proves just as ruthless as Snow in unexpected ways.<br /><br />The end is full of action and will tear at the heartstrings with its unexpected twists and unsuspecting surprises.<br /><br />The book is mainstream young adult fiction set in a dystopian future and is appropriate for readers ten and over. \\"Mockingjay\\" is guaranteed a pageturner! I couldn't put the novel down and once I finished, the characters stayed with me for days after. I highly recommend this story.the characters stayed with me for days after. I highly recommend this story.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book was just amazing! I loved how the author wrote the whole book from a man's perspective! It was funny, true, romantic, arc all the right times! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a funny romance.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was definitely worth the money. I  LOVED it!!!!!!!!!!! People who love percy jackson should read this book!!!!! Hope you enjoy
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book has a complex story with lots of characters.  The story line moves back and forth between them a lot. I enjoyed the book always wondering what was coming next.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is the Mona Lisa of horror stories. So terrifying there are times...even after all these years...after reading this book so many times. I find myself sleeping with the light on and the book stored safely in another room.  You can quibble with other, later works by . King. But this one is his masterpiece.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I like collecting board games and little dice games like this. I first saw this game on Wil Wheaton's: TableTop channel on YouTube, it looked pretty fun. So I bought it and played it, won almost every time-by the way. Overall I would recommend this game to those who like zombie board games.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|I know lots of people complain it's not exactly like the comix, and not as dark (a shame really), but it's still a kick butt flic. Lots of great CGI (for the time) though the scenes in Hell with Malebolgia  are pretty weak. One of the few movies I hope gets a reboot.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Excellent read. Couldn't put it down! A fabulous follow up to &#34;City of Bones&#34;. Leaves you wanting to jump right into the third installment &#34;City of Glass&#34;.
B007JRTSVE|4.0|It was a little slow to get going in the beginning. My son kept asking if this was the right movie. But he was up dancing around by the end.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This could have been a really excellent version of Gatsby. The sets were excellent, the costumes great, even the shots of the author's musings while during the process of writing.  Its was a good interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald classic?<br /><br />There was one big hard to ignore flaw....the artistic license choice of the music, went over like a Loud Fart at a wedding.<br />It was rude, loud, trashy and out of place.  There was a tasteful way to update the music if they felt like that was what was needed to market the movie.  Instead it it just looked stupid!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does just what I want it to, with a very pleasant user interface.  I do leave my kindle plugged in when using the app to avoid draining the battery.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really love using Facebook & being able to keep up to date with all of my family & friends!
B00F0AAC26|4.0|Good album but I do wish Black Thought would have been in there. It has some slower songs and some faster ones.
B000LX00RY|5.0|I always liked this movie as it is not too serious and a good watch on a rainy day.  Good acting and great cast.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book! This book starts off slow buttocks up a quarter through. I would strongly recommend this book. It did not end the way I thought it would!
0920668372|1.0|Parents might like this one more than the kids. It's about how fast our babies grow up. It makes mommies cry. I love it. I purchased it for my niece's &#34;baby's first library&#34; baby shower.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Follett is one of the modern writers I enjoy and I like this genre. So I pick up his books whenever I can.
0399226907|1.0|This is another great educational nature book for little kids. We purchased our kids' favorite books for a niece's baby shower &#34;baby's first library&#34;. Eric Carle is one of the best.
B004UID2LC|5.0|My high school's firewall doesn't allow us to go on youtube. But with this I can test drive it and get on that way.<br />Best discovery ever.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|TOTALLY LOVE THIS ITEM.  I have them all now.  Thank you.<br />Oh, let's see. hhmmm... Well, I watch it.  I like it.  Is this good enough?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just started figuring out all you can do in this game so fun ! And cute too very addicting family fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is loving this game. It requires upkeep of your horse so it teaches some responsibility. It also looks great and runs smooth. It's very fun.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|gets old quick. but it was free so im not complaining. i guess its good to pass the time away
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Informs the audience of a former life style.  Americans inherited pieces of this life style. Beautifully acted. I felt left out when my friends talked about it & so had to watch it.
B004X80QNG|4.0|i wouldnt pay the 9.99 for it but it was free so i love it. use it daily. makes it easy to track my schedule between two jobs. havent gotten into all the features but great so far
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Captivating! The script, production and acting are superb.  I learned a great deal about the time period.  Can't wait until season 4 begins.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|got kinda old quick. maybe it would be fun for a smaller child but i bored quickly. but it was free!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It starts out great with page turning momentum and then becomes a \\"shaggy dog\\" story with the author making up more and more plot lines as he goes ahead.  Totally unbelievable in every respect. Yes, it will keep your interest.  But, in the end, you should feel cheated as the book becomes more & more incredible.  This is an example of a talented word craftsman who cranked out a 2nd rate novel.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fantastic<br />Brilliant<br />Great read and can't wait for the next series on tv as well. Fabulous reader. I lived in his world.<br />-my husband
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is really a great season. The acting and direction are wonderful. Super. A smashing finish and eager for the third.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Unbelievable read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So many facts I learned about this amazing President. President Lincoln is so fascinating and I enjoy reading/watching history documentaries about his life and his presidency.
B0055S348W|5.0|I never write reviews, but I am so happy with this app that I had to.  My biggest disappointment with the kindle is the inability to easily print as with my iPhone. I decided to try this (used the free test version to see if it would work first)  and was blown away by how easy the set up was.  Basically hit a few continue and ok buttons and I printed on my local HP laser over my network Wi-Fi.  That was it<br /><br />The app is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny of avoided frustration
B00BWWS81S|4.0|I got it to have something to listen to while I am driving to work, I enjoy her lyrics, Yellow Flower is my favorite track.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Based on product descriptions and other reviews, I expected Chromecast to stream any content through a Chrome browser. I purposely bought it to make better use of my Amazon Prime membership by streaming Prime Instant Videos by to my TV. However, Prime Videos are not supported by this device. The other content I attempted to stream (YouTube videos) experienced a lag. Therefore, I am returning this product.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Every fifth grader should be required to read this book. It teaches the importance of kindness. I bought the book for my son but I read it before he did. It's a great feel good book.
B00884GR0W|5.0|great game  much better than all those &quot;minecraft&quot; ports.  while this game does follow a same similar genre, it stands alone.  Bought it back when it was $4.99, and still don't regret it. There was so much to do then and its still being updated.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I recommend this book, especially if you're looking for suggestions for a book club. The author tells the story from the vantage point of two characters, which I thought was unique and made the book more interesting.
0805047905|5.0|The pictures are interesting.  My two year old daughter loves to flip through it and make the animal noises by herself.  But also enjoys it being read to her.
B005IGPIDU|5.0|Anyone who doesn't read this book is missing out on a barrel full of belly laughs. You'll never look at Armageddon the same way again. I have read it twice and will read it again.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a fun game for those who like strategy & puzzles.  My ten year old nephew plays it really well.  It is not just for adults.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an incredible book! This should be required reading for all teachers and middle school students. This will give you a totally different perspective on the people in your world.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and it is so addictive I have trouble putting it down.  This is great for using your memory.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|As the rating states I love this album his music is very easy to listen to especially when walking.  As I said I love it.
B000FC13UE|4.0|Enjoyed this collection of stories.  Have been a fan of Mr. Gaiman for some time now.  He can't do much wrong  for me.  He is extremely versatile.  Takes on a lot of different media and many disciplines and keeps on pleasing.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Heard this band for the first time on the music awards and since have bought several of their albums, love their music on my walks.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I chose this rating because.  I like the Bourne Story.  I have all the movies from when Matt Damon played in the first three.  Also, we can see the deconstruction this can do to ones body and face from Jeremy Renner playing Bourne now.  And, this is what our Government has the power to do!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I feel in love the characters, it broke my heart yet at the same time it filled my heart. I have since recommended to friends<br />for there book club. My good friend recommended it to me for my BC.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 2 sons cannot stop playing this game! I would certainly recommend this game to my 2 nephews. I know they would love  it just the same.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's like a book in my pocket. I wish I had more time to read, but when I have a moment, this is very cool.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I was a Star Trek fan back in the 1960's and one who kept writing NBC when they were trying to cancel it.  It is hard to deal with this new timeline that is the background for the last two Trek movies.  The plot this time, story writing, and dialogue surpassed the previous Trek movie.  It was fast paced as most Trek movies are.  I do have difficulty with the actor who portrays Scotty in the New one.  But that is my problem.  I am sure that he is a fine person, but he is NOT Scotty.  I liked the special effects and think back to the cardboard bridge and sets of the first series on tv.  It appeals to all in that it pits the good guys against the bad guys.  The villain was very villainous, but hard to beat Ricardo Maltaban in my favorite of all of the previous Star Trek, meaning Star Trek the Wrath of Khan.  I will see it again, as I love the franchise, and the characters that go along with it.  It is just would not have taken the series down the different time line;  I was obliviously happy in my &#34;old&#34; Trek time line
B005HCI72O|5.0|I love this series this must be the third time I have read it I am so looking forward to reading the next in line.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|This is an entertaining book with fun facts as proof that science is ever present even in sports. I truly appreciate the historical references that help justify and explain the results of the concepts developed by sabermetrics in the major league.<br /><br />It further shows that institutionalized beliefs are not always correct and are often based of feelings more than facts. The facts are that it worked and will work not because one GM got lucky, but because it uses thought and numbers to edge the bets of success. The same can be said of poker: anyone can gamble, but the one that knows the odds of a given hand and the likelihood of facing other hands has a higher rate of succeeding in winning. The difference is that this poker hand is played over an entire season, not in one night. This is the true edge that statistics give him.<br /><br />To the naysayer of this scientific approach, I would love a see or read a discourse proving with scientific fact, not feelings, not unique and isolated anecdotes, but a full season of proof that this cannot and has not worked elsewhere. if you don't believe in the sound theories herein, prove them wrong.
B008KMHFJY|3.0|Its an okay read. Predictable boy meets girl, girl and boy pretend to dislike each other but are in love.  All OK in the end.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read Les Miserables in college over 50 years ago and once or twice since.  Each time I am taken in by its power to dramatize the murky milieu of choices, good and bad, in life. Characters come to life and although the times were so much different then, the huge moral questions are still relevant today and will be tomorrow.  I learn something with each reading, particularly since reading it (no doubt badly) in French for a college class.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It's a fun game to play. A little frustrating at times, but a fun game never the less.  Fun game.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Loved Season 10. Cant wait for Tuesday nights Season 11 premiere! So sad that Ziva (or Ziver, as Gibbs calls her!) is leaving.
1452101248|5.0|Awesome! Just what I was looking for! The best vegeterian book ever! No newd to go to London anymore! Can try it all at home!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My grandsons constantly want to play on my Kindle Fire now!<br />They don't mind the ads at all!<br />Try it and you will love it!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I like minecraft and with all the talk about version 7.0, I now want the new version, because to me the is a limit to crafting and smelting than the computer version of minecraft but because of this new update that is not on Kindle, I am rating this review a one star I would like to rate it 5stars

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The Clean Master app allows you to manage your history, tasks, residual files, privacy and all of your apps from one location with just a few taps of the screen. 5 Star all the way
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This was a wonderful story from a different perspective. It had me questioning whether or not Elizabeth was a victim. I had already read the Red Queen and the White queen and I loved comparing and contrasting the three books as I watched the mini series. I must say that rarely has a book and movie/show match so closely and I must also say that made me excited to tune in each h week to re hash all of the books into one. This is a must read.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is the bom! I really love this game! You could get more blades then that full version Fruit Ninja, I waisted my money AGAIN for the full version of the Fruit Ninja, it's the same exact thing. Well anyway, you should REALLY get this game. I recommend this game to any age! (Meaning 4 to 20 years old). I have so much fun and exciting things you can do on this game! Don't listen to the people who say, &quot;This game sucks&quot; or &quot;This game doesn't work on my Kindle&quot; because it works 100% and I think you can play without WI-FI I think so I'm really not sure. .-.<br />Anyway, just search this game, download it, play it, and please don't EVER listen to the people who say ridiculous, and mean comments about this game, because they probably don't like it because it's boring. (TO THEM NOT US). So just get the game and have fun playing it. xD<br /><br />Bye!<br /><br />~Love Sarah~
B000KIPT30|5.0|I've relegated my receiver and CD-player to the closet, and use my computer for all my sound/music needs.  I use the TCC TC-716 6-Way Stereo Source Selector to manage my various inputs and outputs: my speakers, headphones, guitar amp, and computer sound.  It's a great gadget, but it also attenuates the volume, and my computer's on-board sound doesn't have any to spare.  The speakers, being powered, aren't bothered by the slight drop, but I needed something to boost the sound for headphone listening.  This did the job.<br /><br />I only need one of the channels, so it's overkill for my use, but it seemed like a good product with good reviews and it wasn't any more expensive than  decent-quality single-channel amps.  If anything, it's cheaper.  I've tested all 4 channels and they work.  I don't experience any hum or interference from using it, nor do I experience any static or any other issues when listening to my headphones, or when adjusting the volume knob.  It's velcro'ed in place, and neither it nor the cables move, so I can't talk about if that would cause crackling/static, or if they would come loose.  A cursory wiggle of the box and wires did not disturb the sound quality.<br /><br />It does what I needed without any problems.  I've only had it two months and a few days, but so far, so good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get this game! 2nd top of the list! Once again, never listen to the people who says, &quot;This game never works and it freezes all the time&quot; or &quot;This game doesn't work without WI-FI network&quot;. NO! Never listen to those excuses because it DOES work without WI-FI and it never freezes! Those are total lies.<br /><br />If you want a game that can be really fun and exciting, DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! xD<br />Bye guys<br />~Love Sarah~
1612191290|1.0|Rarely does a book written by an author not schooled in economics or finance seem to catch the world of finance as provocative and leading edge as this book has. Yet for the leading media and publishing interests they have for some reason embraced this book as an alternative to what can only be seen as a parochial \\"left leaning\\" explanation of the evil sins of debt and capitalism.<br /><br />The author clearly writes from an anthropologists perspective and admits many of his misunderstandings about economics and finance in the modern world. Admitting near the end to his astonishment that money in fact has no merit, capitalism does not allow for free labor and other Marxist ideologies proclamations throughout the book, clearly places the bias of this book at the forefront. As detailed as the book appears to be from a historical perspective, the historical anecdotes chosen are clearly done to discredit capitalism based on empiricisms that would make even Saul Alinsky smile with delight.<br /><br />With this philosophical perspective the book is an ideal read for the believer of conspiracies, UFO's, bigfoots and the sensationalized other subjects now topic of late night radio and the other internet broadcasters whose future is one predominated by all American residents being incarcerated into FEMA concentration camps.<br /><br />For the serious student of economic and financial history the book is a failure in providing the scholarly balance one would expect from a serious writer whose pretentious title of a \\"5000 year\\" history is the first clue that this volume is not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Much better authoritative volumes on credit history without the class struggle being the theme exist. Clearly the author provides few if any relevant statistics to back his bias. The few charts included at the end seem an afterthought to bring relevancy to the financial meltdown of the 2000's. The hope seems to be a re-awakening of all to the Marxist ideology and prove once and for all that the demise of capitalism within the theoretical framework of Marx is right!<br /><br />Overall, what has been learned about tyranny stemming from the failure of the Soviet Union and massive financial restructuring of China along the lines of modern finance, has been totally ignored by the author. The economic doomsday painted by the author is in sharp contrast to the living standards that continue to improve yearly in previous communist regimes who now have created their own versions of market economies.<br /><br />This book really is for those that wish to relive their youth and broken ideals of failed socialism ideologies for the many countries that all tried and in the end brought more enslavement to their people than is the current case in what can still be called the western powers and their versions of capitalism. Clearly the bias remains of an author whose base is the UK where continued failed Labor political activists remain active in trade unions promoting the ideal of socialism and prosperity for all. Not to be taken seriously and better stories of Marxist ideology can be had for free.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Love playing but find I spend too much time-wasting on it.  Far better than the version with ads, which were a nuisance.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I just got done beating Montezuma 3 and was seeking a similar game - this game is it!!  This game gets harder as you go along, but there is never a dull moment!  If you like match 3 games with more substance, then this is the game that you are looking for!
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Well acted. Love Julianna Marguiles and Archie Panjabi as well as Alan Cumming. Great story lines about legal cases, parenting, ethics and politics.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is the best ever match 3 game that I have ever played!  The graphics are awesome, the game play is highly addictive, and I never got bored once!  Did I get frustrated?  Absolutely!!  The bonus levels really challenge your mind and skills!  I highly recommend this game and I am so hoping that there will be a 4th!!!  Best dollar I have spent in a long time!
0446699616|3.0|Like the author of the \\"Lacking\\" review, I enjoyed the Lion and hoped for a similar experience reading The Panther. I, too, found it fell short of The Lion.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Still a pretty good game! Being a gamer from way back it is hard to give up quality in the name of technology. I'm not a real big fan of having to waste time looking for a bunch of crap that has NOTHING to do with the story...but that's what there is now-a-days! I've only played the &quot;Trial&quot; version but found the graphics to be pretty good...after it finally got finished downloading (kindle 8.9) took over 3 days to finally finish and would not allow me to cancel the download! Not sure what the deal was with that but it runs well now that it finally finished and installed!
0307950689|2.0|Awful. I skipped whole pages of unnecessary prose that added nothing to the story. Eventually I put the book side and threw it out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hey I f your reading this get this game its so wow zow get get get it so fun :)  (:
0451418441|5.0|I love his genre when the tle is woven well, but I rarely find one. This one is a hit!
B000YJ54DU|2.0|Not one of your best - too much political commentary. Let Reacher stick to fighting bad guys, not world views.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I first watched only about half of this movie until Amazon went down on my Roku.  It was at the point of a disturbing scene and I didn't want to watch anymore.  Then, since the Elisbeth's role was so rivoting, I just had to watch the rest of it.  I actually started watching it again from the beginning and ended up loving the movie, loving the characters, loving the suprise ending and storyline.  It rates high on direction and character building.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Interesting. Hope future not like this. If you like violence you will like this movie. Wonder if sequel is the same.
B004AUGJS8|2.0|Just didn't like the style and direction of the movie.  Didn't like the main character and how can you not like Ryan Gossling but the movie dragged on and could have been edge of your seat kind of thing if directed better.  Even the title was misleading and didn't have a lot to do with the movie.  Gossling's character was a sad, depressed, man who didn't have the strength to live his own life.  He hated his life and just like in real life other people cannot make you happy if you are not happy yourself.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|The colors and sounds are intense on my HD tv and it was worth a little extra for the quality .  Also I loved the extras that came with this show in the Good Morning Storybrook segment that was like a news show from storybrook with commercials from the characters we know and the Fragmented Family tree tracing henry's entire family tree.  If you loved season 1 you love this season and if you can't decide if the price is worth the picture quality over the dvd version than the extras make it that much more entertaining and worth it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've been playing with this on my iphone for a week or so now and having fun with it. It makes learning a language seem like a game, which is helping me stick with it. The Kindle version seems exactly the same, including the speech recognition and being able to hear the spoken parts clearly. It has rewards in the game and keeps track of how many days in a row that you practice. Sometimes it uses written cues, sometimes spoken ones, and sometimes you have to repeat back what it says, so your listening and speaking skills both improve. Just a neat app that makes learning another language fun.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|It's OK; she doesn't have an appealing voice or style-type. The track &#34;Seesaw&#34; is the best, as I had suspected.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|A good cast, good tricks and a nice overall concept. However, the movie doesn't develop the plot or characters.  It moves way to fast for you to feel invested in the story.  Consequently, you aren't drawn into the story.  The surprise twist in the end doesn't leave you with the \\"no way\\" feeling.  Instead, you'll be saying huh?, ok? next movie.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The insight into the Afganis lives and thoughts of different factions is very enlightening,  I recommend this book to everyone to see how they lived before the Russians, during the Taliban rule and now.  Makes you wonder
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good story. Kept our interest.  Liked the relationship between him and the boy in the story.  I liked the ending, too.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Perfect accompliment to the TV series. This is where you truly come to know the characters and the consequence of their actions.  The writing is good. The plot entertaining. A must read for those who are hooked on TV's version of. 'Game of Thrones.'
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome!  The characters are fabulous.  Can't wait for season 4.  What an incredible time in history.  The show brings that era to life.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I really liked the book because I really like the TV series. I was able to picture the TV performers as I read. The author sometimes is hard to follow; it seems he has gone off on a tangent. But he does pull it back together.
B008200LHW|5.0|Good value for a compact GPS device.<br />Works right away with Microsoft MapPoint as a voice-guided navigation device along with a laptop.<br />Works OK with Google Maps and Google Earth to identify current locations, but must install GPSinfo & USB driver included on disk for computer to recognize GPS device. Haven't configured out a way yet to use it as a voice-guided navigation device along with a laptop using Google Maps and Google Earth.<br /><br />Does not work at all with Android tablets because of the COM port configuration restrictions. For Android tablet owner, the bluetooth receiver (another GlobalSat product) would be the one to use, but make sure your Android tablets are equipped with bluetooth chips inside too. This USB receiver has no bluetooth connection.
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|So contrived and completely beyond belief.  Only finished the book to see if there were any redeeming features - there weren't - the end was completely incredible.  I have enjoyed many of these books as great escapism, but there are only so many times you can suspend belief, and this was the last straw
B0012QVJXS|4.0|I have been looking for a superhero movie, that my 5 year old son would enjoy, and this one was perfect.

B002N57KG2|4.0|The cast was great,but lets think about it people who compete from New jersey to LA in A cross country illegal race for what ever reason.There's every kind of cars and vans there's A lot of adventure and laughes.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was not familiar with the author but had read many outstanding reviews on this book. Very well written. Stays with you long after the novel is finished.

B009AY04A8|4.0|This game was entertaining. I found myself wanting to get through a sequence so I could get to the next challenge.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|In many ways I was not able to make any sense of the movie. Some kind of out break from who knows were turns people into Zombies,but only if your not all ready terminal ill.A man who used to be with the world Heath Org. (WHO)is brought back in to find what this illness is and how to stop it.Stopping it turns out to be very weird.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have the AccuWeather app on my Kindle Touch so when I bought my Kindle Fire HD, I downloaded it to the new device.<br /><br />The Fire HD version is even more gooder than the monochrome version.<br /><br />I access my local daily weather guess every morning before I go to work since the weather becomes a considerable factor in my job.<br /><br />With the Fire version I get wonderfully colorful weather maps for my area that accurately show what's going on on the other side of my living room window. Now, you may ask why I don't just look out the window to see what the weather is. Good question!<br /><br />It's because I spent so much money on this fancy new Kindle that I feel it would go to waste if I didn't do something cool with it like check out the weather!<br /><br />It really does a nice job and actually is accurate to within a degree or two when I look at the daily and hour-by-hour weather guess. It's close enough that I know whether or not to take my jacket, parka or an umbrella for the day. And at the end of the day that's really what it's all about, isn't it?

B001KX50BK|5.0|I have tried for years to get a copy of Pretty Woman on DVD that was the origianl movie. The 10th edition and forward releases have additional footage that ruins the movie. I was thrilled to find the movie on Blu-ray without the extras!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Never read a Michael Connelly book or story that wasn't great!  You really shouldn't insist upon a set number of words!  It turns me off.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have only read the 1st book but I was enthralled. 'Course I am an old fantasy and sci-fi fan but I enjoy a well told drama too.<br />The characters are not over the top and the fantastic setting feels very plausible in the course of the story's events.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's great for when your bored and don't have anything to do or want a little brain game. It's cool
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Great story, characterisation,historical aspect was great,couldn't put it down.<br />Learnt so much about harshness of climate and gugas,a must read
B0018CMJSU|5.0|What else can you say?  It's the classic gangster/mafia production against which all others are measured.  Always entertaining and required for every video library.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|The game keep me interested. I bore easy but with this game I can not wait to get back to it.  I is a good mix of hard and easy.
B000V39KDO|5.0|A good blend of history and entertainment.  Nothing could be wrong with a movie about men of conviction facing evil and killing it.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|Not your normal blood soaked gory zombie movie,which is exactly what makes this movie awsome.It coolness comes from good acting,plot,and a fast pace.I will definitly own it in the future.
9889979942|5.0|I, like author and photographer Tom Carter, have spent years living, traveling, and taking photographs in China. But whereas my photos ([...] tend to focus on nature and urban and rural built environments, Mr. Carter's photography captures a side of China which I've never quite been able to capture: the human side. That's why I appreciate this book so much. \\"China: Portrait of a People\\" contains hundreds of photographs of all different kinds of Chinese people in their element. I've got to hand it to Mr. Carter for finding these people and telling their stories in pictorial form. All the shades of modern China are on display here, from upscale urbanism to gritty industrial tableaux to the ethnic minority-dominated borderlands. All the photos are beautiful, even those which do not capture traditionally beautiful scenes. The grittier photos, in my opinion, are the most telling. More than just another coffee table book of pretty pictures, this is one collection I will find myself turning to again and again, a snapshot of China in the new millennium.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Amazing cd. Soulful, mellow, and sultry. John legend has delivered once again. I recommend to all those who enjoy real music.

B002M9WW30|5.0|What is there to say about the Rocky Balboa series?  It sprung Stallone to stardom and was a consistently good action movie.
B008Y729FU|5.0|I love this movie.  I hadn't seen it in a long time and after seeing I will watch it soon again.
B001EBV0NA|5.0|This is always my go to thriller. I watch a couple of times a year. It is a classic of it's era!!!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Underdog female heroine showing pluck and courage in a tough struggle to survive...is a classic theme. The fact that given the mores of the time in which the novelist lived, the protagonist is something of a rebel in her environment, and is rewarded by achieving all her dreams by the end of the novel; in a style that fits the character.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I like the fact it was written in the first person. Larry is a saint.  The characters are real, they are trying to survive a confined and restricted life, and by being inventive and creative with the resources they have, the women manage to make there sentences somewhat bearable. I would recommend anyone dabbling in drugs to read this.  It is appalling that there are so many people in prison due to drug trafficking , and drug use.  Drug use needs to be stopped by attacking the sources and suppliers, not incarcerating the users. Rehabilitation and common sense would be a more fitting sentence for the users.  The suppliers should be in prison. Piper had to go to prison.  Isn't it odd that in our society,  people so recklessly make bad decisions, that end up hurting whole families?
B00F91H666|4.0|Quick paced from the very beginning to the end. Good movie. I liked it more than I thought I would.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love the way the game seems so realistic.  Having fun with designing my parks.  Way to go with the hours of fun I have.  Highly recommend this game..
B0064W652A|5.0|Barman at its best. It was a great story that was pretty much self contained which makes it a great pick it up and read anytime.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The sounds offered here are unusual and interesting. Although some sounds loop, it is barely noticable and totally acceptable, unlike other systems I have tried. I use this app every night to help me fall asleep and I believe I am getting a better night's sleep as a result.

B00006674X|4.0|I first saw this film at the age of 12, in the age of Dialing for Dollars (Janis Joplin, anyone?) Strangely enough, \\"Elvis Week\\" played before Elvis was dead. The Beatles were the week before. I fell in love with both.<br /><br />I am now pushing 50 and I still love my Beatles and Elvis movies. I must have seen \\"Change of Habit\\" 50 times since I was a kid, and the more I see it, the better I like it. It is true some parts are ridiculous, including my pet beef that the nuns are wearing make-up, specifically eye-shadow, in the convent, prior to being \\"released\\" into the general population. I consider criticisms such as this \\"chump change\\" -- the kind of thing I can accept as long as the \\"premise\\" of the movie is reliable.<br /><br />Serious critics can pick apart many \\"credibility\\" moments in this movie. Much might appear \\"dated.\\" But for me, I look for the \\"soul\\" of the movie; the serious intent of the characters -- and the actors behind the characters -- who put their soul into this movie to put forth ideals in ways they were not allowed in their mainstream professional lives.<br /><br />Elvis (privately) rated this one of the best movies he'd ever done, but, because it was his last movie and was not backed by a soundtrack, was considered by Col. Parker a failure, and therefore did not \\"exist\\" as a record of accomplishment financially or through social impact. People who \\"study\\" Elvis know he never cared about the \\"bottom line\\" dollar-wise; he always cared about people. In this movie, it shows.<br /><br />Lastly, and this may be a \\"technical\\" point, but this is the only movie I've ever seen that even remotely deals with what was called the Ecumenical Movement. I am not Catholic, or religious, but it seems to be that this movie takes on even a sliver of social and human rights issues that were taking place in the late 1960s that really weren't addressed at all until prior to the turn of the century, and is poised to be an issue under the current Papal administration,as I write this.<br /><br />This movie is not for everybody. Some people would say that \\"only people who love Elvis would care about this movie.\\" I can honestly say I never cared about Elvis until I saw this movie.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I had seen this movie in the local theater when it first came out and enjoyed it very much.  It's just fun to watch it occasionally.
B000HZGBLA|2.0|Funny how a movie about time can be such a waste of time. This is a stinker and no two ways about it. I would not watch this again.<br />Even Daniel Craig comes off as wooden. I am glad I never actually payed money to see this when it came out.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book broke my heart, but I could not put it down. A wrenching but beautifully written story. Recommend it, but maybe not for the faint of heart.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|typical zombie fare. seen one seen em all. brad pitt is good actor but story is not plausible. milla does it better in her resident evil films.
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie and can watch it again again and love it as much as the first viewing. I am always amazed by the negative reviews for movies I like so much. Remember it is a movie, not real life, and allow yourself to get lost in the story. Yea, unabashedly, I loved it. I think it is a beautiful movie and story.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Enjoy the characters and interactions ongoing. Probably truer reflection of hi-powered corporate law than most would care to admit. I'm from the Midwest, but can only imagine the daily intrigue of &#34;big city&#34; law firms, and enjoy the entertainment it gives me as an observer and the relief I have enjoying the simple life. I detest the ridiculous so called &#34;  reality&#34; shows and gossip programs and shows that encourage bad behavior, rudeness, bullying, etc. I think the young boy who said at the Boston Marathon &#34;why can't we all get along?&#34; A very good question, entertainment at a &#34;real&#34; person's expense is NOT entertainment. A program like &#34;SUITS&#34; allows us to see bad behavior in fantasy situations and the results of such behavior. It's back to the day of bad behavior=bad returns. Anyway, it helps relieve the stresses of the day by showing other peoples' problems, so you don't feel alone. Good writing, acting, and characters. Try it I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Thanks for the program.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Words can not express the wonder of these cds. Individually, they were masterful. Together they were the defining of greatness. What a treasure to have captured these performances for posterity. Need more stars--5 is not enough.
B000MXJ7LS|3.0|I was pleased by the focus (on individuals vs. the coverage we saw on the news for years), but didn't really get connected to the characters (other than the two trapped mens' wives).
B000M4RG42|5.0|I loved this movie and don't understand the poor reviews. It is a heart rendering look at WW2 and a revealing history of Iwo Jima and the iconic flag raising. Everyone should know this history. I was surprised by how much I liked this movie and will recommend it highly.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I do not go to the movies very much, however, I never miss any Star Trek film. This is no exception. More violent/darker than most, but still very exciting. I always buy the DVD when it is available to add to my collection. For any Star Trek fan, this DVD should be added to the collection.

0425261360|2.0|I love the early Kay Scarpetta books. Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down. I couldn't wait for the next book to come out. I recommended this series of books to my friends all the time. Somewhere along the line, the Kay Scarpetta series started to get bogged down in technical details and minutiae that weren't germane to the story and decreased this reader's enjoyment. I miss the Kay of the earlier works. Sadly, I'm not sure if I'll continue with the Kay Scarpetta series.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|This was a good book. The story was good and I wanted to know what was going to happen. And I can't resist learning a little something from any historical fiction. However, I was expecting more. I guess that I just assumed that any book from Stephen King would be more twisted, more suspenseful or more of a thriller. I thought that the love story in the middle was too long and drawn out, but I did keep reading thru it and was pulling for the characters. I was hoping for more of what changes in the future when the past was changed. That was the intriguing part to me and was much too brief. Overall, I was glad that I read this book and I did enjoy it even if I was expecting more.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Can't wait to read more!  Great start to this series.  Kept me wanting more, I didn't want to put it down.
B006588YUE|1.0|This fan/heatsink assembly arrived with the thermal paste smeared and ruined. The circular clear plastic top that is supposed to protect the thermal paste was dislodged and smeared/lifted the thermal paste. A proper packaging design would have prevented this.

B00EMJD6TC|4.0|Was very surprise by the \\"cure\\" twist. Prolly will watch this again. Not usually a Brad Pitt fan but he was great in this.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Child's books are great.  Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher.  Too short (by a foot), too ascerbic, too cocky . . . .gee, sounds just like Tom Cruise in most of his movies.  In the books, Reacher almost never uses a gun, rarely drives (doesn't have a license) and while he doesn't take guff from anyone, he is usually easy going, mild mannered and polite.  We saw none of those qualities in the movie and Cruise turned the character into a gun toting, race car driving jerk.  It looked a lot like a standard Tom Cruise drive too fast shoot em up movie and not at all like the richly developed character from the book series.  Liam Neeson would have been a perfect Reacher, how sad.  So if you like Tom Cruise's version of &#34;thrillers&#34; you'll enjoy this, but if you are a Reacher fan, you'll find it seriously and embarassingly lacking. Shame on Lee Child!

B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Great game concept, but Galaxy SII, I can't beat the time trial. Given most games like this get harder as you progress, that keeps the start rating down. Sorry dev- you got the third star for no permissions and low file size.
0316228583|4.0|While this book will not be in the canon of western literature 50 years from now it is still a good book. The book has characters that are all flawed even the one who is held to be a the greatest man in the town. It also makes you question issues because everything is not black and white.  The end does not end on a sad or happy note but a mix of both. The only complaints I have with this book is that it does not make an impression that will last for years. The other complaint is that a serious situation is used at the end to keep a character likeable at the end which turns it into a plot device.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Stable and works well on my Galaxy SII and Note 10.1. Low permissions, small file size, and hours of potential puzzle-fun make this a keeper. I recommend you should buy it.

B000QRIGLC|3.0|I am amazed with how we put our fighting men and women in war in harm's way. If we are going to fight  a war, we need to throw everything at the enemy instead of fighting with all kinds of restrictions. The book was okay. I do feel sadness for what we put our people through.

B00C7BZYRO|5.0|Directed by James Ponsoldt from a screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber based on the novel by Tim Tharp, The Spectacular Now is a marvelously crafted film about teenagers on the threshold of adulthood, centered around the character of Sutter Keely, an amiable slacker (and more-than-borderline alcoholic) who's content to live in what he calls 'the spectacular now' with no thought of - or regard for - the future. Or for the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />The film begins with Sutter (Miles Teller) working on a college application, responding to an essay question asking him to describe a hardship he's faced. His response is a self-indulgent rant about how everything in his life was going great until his \\"perfect high school couple\\" girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson) broke up with him over a misunderstanding, which is then shown in flashback, where we learn more about Sutter. Later at a party, he runs into Cassidy again and tries to patch things up with her, only to learn that she's moved on and has a new boyfriend, Marcus (Dayo Okeniyi). Sutter reacts by getting more drunk than usual, ending up passed out on a stranger's lawn with no idea how he got there or where his car is. He is found and woken awake by a girl from his high school named Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who was driving by in the course of delivering newspapers for her mom. Partly out of gratitude and partly because he needs to find his car, Sutter helps Aimee deliver the rest of her papers, and on an impulse asks her to have lunch with him, to which she hesitantly agrees, not being used to being the object of any boy's interest. A relationship begins to develop between the two, in spite of the misgivings of their friends. Aimee's friend Bethany (Ava London) is protective, not wanting Aimee to get hurt because she knows Sutter's party-boy reputation. Sutter's best friend Ricky (Masam Holden) is also concerned because he _knows_ Sutter. He knows that Aimee - who's kind of shy and likes reading sci-fi and Japanese manga - isn't the kind of party-girl Sutter usually gets involved with.

One of the best things is how it shows how Sutter's amiable slacker who's content to just drift along is the exception, that most of his friends _are_ conscious of impending adulthood and are concerned about their futures. And they do worry about what they're going to do next and whether they're making the right decisions. Cassidy, for example, voices these concerns when she tries to explain to Cutter - who keeps making impulsive attempts to get back together with her - why she prefers Marcus to him: it's because Marcus, while he's not as much fun to be with, is serious. Marcus has a future ahead of him, a future that he's actively moving towards, a future of the kind that she wants to have, and Sutter... doesn't.

B007G51UV0|5.0|This was a great replacement for the P8Z68-V PRO board. I have had this board installed for about six months now with no problems. The fast boot time with Windows 8, an I7 2600K processor and a mechanical HDD is still blazing fast at just under 16 seconds. I didn't install the wifi adapter, so I can't comment on the speed of it. All in all, a good board. BTW, it's suitable for a hackintosh build as well.

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Why can't American TV produce shows like this,<br />It seems as if American TV keeps putting out shows like the Bachelor & Batchelorette, Survivor, The Amazing Race, The Apprentice, Big-brother, etc. Do these TV studios think Americans are idiots; I'm sick of seeing shows that try to elevate the scum of the earth.<br />Currently, Great Britain is on fire with the quality of programing it's releasing. Shows like Broadchurch, Luther, Sherlock, Downton Abbey, and Dr. who are shows that my family and I look forward to. They are well acted, plotted, paced, and are worthy of the thought provoking discussion that they sometimes inspire.
B00DU74U74|2.0|This movie had potential. Unfortunately there was almost no character development, so even by then end of the movie I really didn't care about the characters. And what the hell was the alien love story plot about? The guy hardly had any dialogue with her, but the somehow fell in love? So stupid.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|J.J. Abrams should be applauded for his stellar job of imagining of the Star Trek franchise. I enjoyed the original Star Trek series, and enjoyed the even numbered movies. However, &#34;Into Darkness&#34; broke from tradition and was nearly as good or nearly better than it's predecessor. If you have not seen it yet, you need to. Benedict Cumberbatch was outstanding as the villain.

B001974DG0|5.0|As a long time fan, I have read a great many of Dan Koontz's books. Somehow I missed &#34;Watchers&#34; until I down loaded it on my new tablet. This is  a real page turner. I believe this is his very best work. It is frightening but it is also warm  and loving. If you are a dog lover, this is the book for you!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I can't believe how good the first one looks in comparison. The plot is terrible and disjointed, the fight scenes are lame, and although there are some solid performances by cast it's not enough to save this movie. The first did a much better job of making me care about the characters (almost none of whom carried over to this weak sequel).

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. There were so many great insights into how people feel about themselves and how introverts relate to the world. There is much shame tied to being an introvert and this books simply describes us as \\"different\\", not \\"less than\\". The chapters were divided well, the sections were well written and researched, and examples were interesting. Highly recommended for introverts and non-introverts.

B0041H18MM|1.0|I was horrified by how quiet this track was. I had to bump up the volume %1,000 in SoundForge and now there's a slight hissing sound. Should've downloaded another version of this track.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Personally, I found this book positively enriching.  It answered many questions I've had over my lifetime as a Christian, one question being &#34;Since he hadn't died on a cross yet, what was the Good News that Jesus taught&#34;.  This question, and others, was answered for me in this honest and revealing look at the life and times of Jesus.  It also explains the history leading up to his life, and the struggles facing the early believers, and goes on to talk about how the early Christian church was formed.  If you want to learn more about what Jesus really was about, this book is a must-read for you.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great job keeps you on the edge..... leading you to an end in which I did not see on the beginning or the end.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Great acting and story lines.  The series gets much better towards the end of the season.  I'm currently watching the early episodes of season 3 which is even better than season 2.  Great series to watch while I'm on my elliptical,
B001XVD21Y|5.0|Supposedly based on real life story of Whitey Bulger.  This may be the best roles Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg and the crybaby whose name I have forgotten have played.  A lot of really good talent, a great story line, and superb acting in this film.  The only thing out of place was the &#34;psychologist&#34; lady Dr. who was being passed around between the players.  Clearly had nothing to do with the film and I very much doubt ever existed in real life.  Just a directors feeble attempt to get some kind of romance in this film - which clearly did not need it.  See it anyway.  You will like it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I just finished reading this, so it's still sinking in and washing through me, making it difficult to talk about. But I'm going to try anyway.<br /><br />This is a story about growing up. Not about growing older; growing older is just...growing older. Growing up is realizing that the world is bigger and stranger and more important than you ever knew before. It's realizing that you're not the most important thing in the world, although you're still important enough.<br /><br />This is a story about magic. Not about spells and enchantments and wizards and witches, but about the real magic of the world, the magic of everyday things and the magic of the vast, mysterious universe. The magic of dreams and memories and friendships that disappear and reappear.<br /><br />It reminds me a lot of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes, although in ways that aren't easy to articulate. They're different roads, but they both come from and lead to the same place.<br /><br />This story is short and small, like a pond. But it's also huge and deep like an ocean. The writing is both plain and simple and poetically profound. It touched me deep inside my heart. It brought tears to my eyes and a smile to my lips.
0307352145|5.0|As an introvert, this book helped me understand myself and others who are like me - as well as the extroverts whom I know and love. So well written and easy to read, full of great information. Thanks to the author for validating the power of quiet people!
B00EOGZ42U|5.0|Eufloria is unique in its style and mood.  In a genre dominated by machines and technology, it delivers a botanical struggle set amidst the stars that somehow feels true to itself.  Its story is minimal, but delivers just enough narrative to advance the mood of the game without getting in the way of playing.  Eufloria is for lovers of strategy that could use an organic break from a genre that can be a bit too stylistically predictable.<br /><br />Making RTS (real-time strategy) on a small screen is a challenge.  Eufloria started on the PC, but this mobile adaptation is masterfully done.  Most non turn-based strategy on mobile is Tower Defense, which I'm a big fan of, but I wish there were more RTS.  Eufloria really manages to streamline the mobile user interface for RTS without gutting or over-simplifying the underlying elements of the genre.  Eufloria manages to be simple to learn, both in the rules of the game and in the control mechanics, yet very challenging at its highest settings.  Even a lot of fairly complex PC RTS games like to avoid resource management, but Eufloria actually retains that mechanism without allowing it to become tedious.  Nothing is in the game that doesn't fit, but it's surprising just how much fits into a package this elegant.<br /><br />It carries an easy going tone in the normal story mode on the aptly named relaxed play setting that feels less like beating a game and more like raking a zen garden, but when you turn up the difficulty, peaceful meditation becomes a cutthroat darwinian struggle for survival.  You can play this really slow, and it makes a nice game to play while doing something else, like watching the news.  But you don't have to play slow.  There are three speed settings, so you can crank it up and at a decidedly non-zen pace if you like.  Combine faster play with the challenging play setting and the dark matter mode, and you can have quite a tough game on your hands.  The challenging mode was titled 'dynamic' in the PC version, and that describes how it works pretty well.  Opposing forces are more aggressive and more likely to take advantage of any opening you give them.<br /><br />It's also a lot of game for your money.  The main storyline took me 10 hours on the PC on the slow setting (I'm only about 2/3s through on this version, but it appears to be the same).  Then there's dark matter which should take longer if you go slow, then there are skirmish levels, and if you play in relaxed before graduating to challenging, your total play time could be staggering for a mobile game.  There are collectible objects hidden through the game for you to collect and achievements that are fairly well designed to encourage you to try some cool stuff.  As big a game as it is, I hope the devs have a sequel germinating in their greenhouse right now, because I'd love to have more of this.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Having never played the board game, I would have appreciated more detailed instructions related to strategy and scoring.  Nevertheless, it has been fun.  I haven't won a game yet, but I will.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|With a simple and straightforward writting, Don Miguel Ruiz reminds us that life is profound yet simple. The most simple rules are those that connects us to our essence and use the mind as an instrument. This is one of those apparently simple books to keep by our side and read over and over, to remind us of our inner light.

B0014JKJJI|5.0|I purchased these because I work in the food service industry.  And I love them!!  They do not have the holes in the front and they have an enclosed heal (to a small degree.)  They also have a slip resistant rubber bottom.  I have been wearing them for almost 2-years, and they are still holding up well.  I work under all conditions, heat, cold, wet, sand and they hold up well for all conditions.  I often spill beer on them, and I just hose them off and scrub them up!  If it is really hot, I wear black ankle socks with them so I don't sweat too bad, but I've never had a big problem sticking inside of them, however, it can happen.  Yes, they are Crocs, and I get joked often, but after being on my feet for 12+ hours... joke me all you want... they are comfy!
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|Great idea and timely in subject. It could have been a great movie if it was not for the soundbite presentation.<br /><br />The acting is good but the film structure has a lot to answer for. I think they put in the standard character conflicts to punch up the story.<br /><br />It is the Iranian revolution. In the chaos six U.S. Embassy people escape to the Canadian embassy. Now the problem is how to extricate them before they are detected and dispatched. \\"To this day, this story stands as an enduring model for international cooperation between governments.\\"<br /><br />So an ersatz movie company for a film called \\"Argo\\" is formed. We listen to lots of talk and a few dispatches. Yet the story progresses ever so slowly.<br /><br />As Tom Stoppard, author of \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\" writes \\"In a tragedy even minor characters die.\\"
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|This movie was so well made and so poignant that the subtitles didn't even detract from the quality of the movie. Excellent in every way!

B00DHRLK84|4.0|This review relates primarily to your decision to buy the 3d version or not. As loudly as I can, do not waste your money on 3d and simply savor the regular blu ray version.  Sadly, the 3d version adds nothing.  This is an incredible movie, no doubt, but the 3d really doesn't even deserve the name. The only difference between the regular and the 3d is that you have to wear the annoying glasses to watch the 3d version. Definitely rush to buy this movie, just learn from my mistake and content yourself with blu ray.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Pretty good show...heard it was good but finally checked it out for my self  not bad at all will continue to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very very very very good and the time of the glades to adjust the time on a gift
B00E34A9FU|5.0|No point in stating which is the best GD concert of all time because Deadheads could not agree. But.....this is certainly one of their best and few will argue that.<br /><br />Movie: The movie has certainty been \\"fixed/upgraded\\" since I first bought it on VHS many moons ago. But don't expect a Steven Spielberg epic. It's basically a low budget film. This is NOT a concert film of the entire concert. It includes some, but not all, of the highlights. It is certainly worth watching in context. The songs in particular sound outstanding when watching the footage. Naked people dancing? Yes. Some of that. But this was a concert in the 70s and anyone who went to any festival of note won't be shocked by this (Remember this was when streaking was in vogue). The movie augments the music. It brings it to life. Watching them play off each other (China>Rider, Dark Star) is some exceptional footage. Naked Iggy Pop like dude hanging on the pole during Bird Song (he finds his shorts by Dark Star) makes me laugh when I see it just because another Deadhead friend pointed him out. The little kid running on the stage during Dark Star with Weir smiling at the \\"intrusion\\". Priceless - right in the middle of a quintessential Dark Star. The real vibe - not fake or phony or forced or commercial. A lot of cutoff jeans and happy people. More than anything - it shows the band interaction during some of their greatest live music ever and you just can't beat that.<br /><br />Music: If you are a Deadhead you already know this is great. For the 30 years it toured is this a top 5 concert? Arguably yes (I think so). For its time, it is close to a perfect setlist - all played exceptionally. For my money the band takes off during what may be their greatest China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider. God it is fun to listen to (and watch). The Playin' is fantastic. Almost 20 minutes and fantastic. Best ever? If not, it is close. Dark Star? best ever? If not it is close. Same with Greatest Story, Promised Land,Bird Song - you name it. I forgot how much I loved this particular Bird Song. Seminal live versions of some of their greatest songs. A fantastic musical experience. It's a pleasure just to watch them play their instruments, virtuosity on display that day. How does it sound? After owning about ten copies of this on CD, DAT and even cassette - it sounds \\"just exactly perfect\\". Well done David, Jeffrey and all those involved.<br /><br />Packaging: Sturdy, nice. Good articles. The one by David Lemieux (the title) made me laugh out loud. The fact that John Dwork wrote in the booklet as well shouldn't surprise anyone who owns the Compendium. Good stuff. Well done.<br /><br />For my money, the best audio/visual Grateful Dead experience you can have when they were at the height of their powers. Give this as a gift or spoil yourself - you won't regret it. Hats off to all the people who made this finally happen.<br /><br />Overall value: *****

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|To begin with, I do not understand why none of the three major networks picked this up.  It's a great series.  Each episode starts exactly where the previous show ended.  Excellent story plot, great acting and directing.  Each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat.  There are always at least two or more stories within a story going on at the same time. Mike and Rachel's on-again off-again relationship strongly pulls at your heart strings. Harvey Specter is the kind of arrogant lawyer you would only want on your side. This series will end up being a classic like Matlock, McBride, Perry Mason, etc.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I loved this movie you will love it too.  I cried a little but was happy at the ending.  It was terrific
067942850X|5.0|Effectively written, it stimulate the reader instead of provide assumptive answers. Chris character is very touching for his desire to be true to himself and to his beliefs and maybe he demanded too much of himself, even more than he could deliver.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|If you like zombies and epidemics, you will probably like World War Z. That's about the gist of it.<br /><br />It actually feels like it was created by kids. It has lots of imagination, but little reality. You're really going to have to have the ability to suspend reality to get into this. But, if you like zombies and epidemic movies, you're halfway there, right? I prefer sci fi or paranormal type movies because they are way scarier because they COULD be true. There is no way that anyone would ever believe that this could happen the way it played on screen, so it wasn't the least bit scary.<br /><br />The acting was okay. Nothing to complain or write home about. The scenes were okay. The zombies looked like dumb zombies. All in all, it was on the dull side of alright. It wasn't horrible, but i wouldn't see it again.

B00D7OMNXS|1.0|I really never ever give a movie 1 star, but when the end credits rolled by I felt shakin up, a bit dizzy, and some throw up splashed into my mouth. I won't go into detailed story plots cause there really isn't one.<br />Easily the worst Marvel film to date.<br />Did Any cast member take this train wreck seriously. Downey never really donned the armor at all, The Mandarin by Kingsley was a Sick joke, a stupid 10 year old sidekick, Pepper Pots donning the Iron Man Suit (TWICE) and saving the hero, stupid one liners, Guy Pierce sucks. And Tony Stark is now the Anxiety attacked mega Pu33y who needs help from a 10 year old boy from Chattanoogah, Tennessee. Really, I'm not joking.<br />So very very bad.<br />Shame on Marvel.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the weather channel because you can look any time you want to know about the weather and its there. The fact that you can put in any city or zip code and check their weather is very helpful. I,however,liked the older version where you could get the whole days weather in words.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie series is developing well.  There was a huge amount of action, especially toward the end.  I like the way this series of writings is &#34;tying&#34; into key points of the original tv series.  I hope JJ Abrams will take this &#34;alternate&#34; Star Trek into a new direction.  I realize that the characters may be the same, but the plot lines are open to wherever the writer wishes to go.<br />With so many of these alternate reality time line shows, the premise is that we are the correct time line.  It would be interesting to see some &#34;new&#34; characters which the plot indicates our time line character has been killed and this new time line character can take the story to a different set of goals. (be he good guy or bad guy).<br />Its just a thought.  I am looking forward to the next story line.  Thanks JJ.

B00C7JG0KG|4.0|Like this movie.  While it's not likely to be an Oscar winner it is a great family movie to enjoy with the kids!
B0017XD3OY|4.0|This movie was very good.  The storyline moved along nicely, keeping my focus.  A great movie to watch on a Saturday night.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I own android and PC versions of all of the Angry Birds games.  They are all so much fun and the replay value never seems to decline.  (at least for me) This new Star Wars II is delightful.  I love the new twists like the magnets and being able to play as the pigs instead of the birds.  The graphics/backgrounds are imaginative and colorful and the sound effects and character voices are hilarious.  All add to the game's appeal.  The creativity and understanding of the psychology of why people like to play games are &#34;off the charts&#34; and I congratulate the creators and Rovio for their never-ending gifts to their customers.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Something completely different.  Definitely a curious tale of a strange variety of human beings doing things outside their life experience
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Still trying to get use to how the phone displays the device and the options to use certain apps. Overall the item has been functioning pretty well for Netflix and Youtube videos. I would like to see other apps being compatible for streaming via the Chromecast.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|This allows you to sort items in a file by name, date, size, type either ascending or descending.  All I had to do was to create a folder in Photoshop for the pix I wanted and rename them with the numeric order I wanted as the beginning of the name.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Fabulous acting by Daniel Day-Lewis--he truly is Lincoln!  Love this movie, it allows our children to learn a little bit about history in a dramatic way.
B007RQ6WCA|4.0|Works well for what I need it for. now I don't have to waste space on my tablet for stuff I only use once in a while.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Literally all I have to say about it. Ok I need ten more words to submit. The sun is yellow.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a quick read. A really good page turner. I enjoyed reading the entire hunger games series. I wish there was another book after mockingjay.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really liked this book and couldn't put it down.  I was sorry to finish it and will definitely read more books by this author.  I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is really good. sort of like subway surgery and temple run all in one. though the gru coins are so hard to get.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is a fantastic series The writing, the actors, the premise.....all fantastic. I watch an episode, on Amazon, just about every day. If I could change on thing about the show it would be in the pilot, where Alicia slaps her cheating, shit of a husband,  I would like it to be either a punch or a good swift kick in the balls. I'm easy and could go with either as long the last we see of him in this episode, is him face down on the floor....
B007W4OZ76|3.0|works for what I use it for. DropBox on the kindle evidently requires another app to be able to download files to the kindle. it does this well but some of the other features are a little flaky. it evidently does not parse the whole file name so when downloading files if they are not extremely unique in name then it will just overwrite files.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Good show, entertaining. Get what you expect. Perfect chill/relax movie. Not going to win any emmys but it was definitely enjoyable with friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! This is the only game I go on!!! Would reccomend this to everybody I know!! Favourite game ever!!!
B006RJTEIC|1.0|Absolutely awful. Ancient special effecrs. Stilted acting. Slow, robotic acting. Really a waste of my money. Don't waste your time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed it in order for me to do my homework for my classes. Success! Thank you Adobe.. Adobe for education.
630521610X|5.0|This movie is perfect in so many ways. When it first came out, it was hailed for being frightening for its violent murders yet comical for its recognition of the horror genre, which director Wes Craven had been integral in defining (he also directed Nightmare on Elm Street, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Last House on the Left in the 70s and 80s). These comments still remain true today, and the references to other scary movies only get increasingly relevant with the continual stream of slasher and horror flicks which have come out since 2000.<br />This movie is such a modern classic, and it still remains scary to this day. One of the best horror movies I've seen, and immediately one of my favorites. Great film!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Good book. Enjoyed it. Always more detailed than movies. Love e books. You can read any time, any where on your phone, tablet, or PC. Go from one device to another and be synced to the same page as you left off. As long as u have Internet, of course.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I downloaded this for $14.95. It would have been better if Amazon had paid me $14.95 to NOT order it. I devised a better solution: I will buy a new small laptop that is light, easy to carry and actually has software that function properly.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Works as described.  Mounted on my BMW G650gs handlebar.  Very firm mount, easy to install.  Using with X-grip and short double socket arm and it works awesome for mounting my electronics.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I don't usually re-read romance novels, but I love this one. It's so opposite my real life that something about it is addictive. However, I cringe at the thought of young women reading this and thinking that this is a desirable relationship. NOT recommended for impressionable young women. :)
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am completely in love with this series.  The characters quickly became friends, even the \\"bad\\" guys are easy to relate to.  This series is one of my all time favorite ever.
B004SIP9O2|5.0|This movie is a great sequel to the original Scream. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson really did a good job of continuing the story, and they developed a storyline that was really complex.<br />Scream 2 finds Sidney Prescott in college, separated and \\"protected\\" from the murders which she lived through a few years earlier. When the murders begin again, Sidney, along with the other survivors of the murders, are the only ones who are able to potentially find who the killer is. The ending will really surprise you (if you haven't seen this movie before).<br />This movie really keeps you on edge, and the action pretty much gets going fast and doesn't stop until the end. The only disappointing part of this movie is that **SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT** Randy dies... ;(<br />Great sequel to a great original! Definitely recommend!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun and addicting to play over and over again totally worth the space and time to get
B00F91RYL8|2.0|If you read the book, you will not like this movie.  It's fair to say that it would probably take several movies to cover the entire story of World War Z.  This would have been a great mini-series produced by either HBO or Showtime.  There are a handful of entertaining moments in the movie, but that's about it.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time. DeNiro was the draw for me but I ended up very impressed with Travolta too. The story was good and it kept me interested the entire movie. I can't believe anyone could find anything negative to say about it.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|A bit cheesy but I had expected that. Enjoyable for the most part, there are some 'plot holes' that bugged me later on but I was told this was based on a book and it's easier to understand if you've read them. I haven't read them.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my sister.  She had watched the series and loved it.  I had no doubt she'd love the set.  She does.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This is a very good movie, and the most plausible story of how a &#34;zombie&#34; apocalypse could happen, if you believe in that stuff.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|totally entertaining....surprise ending....loved the plot and the characters were great...each one as good or better than the other...great job of<br />casting...
B0042XA2U4|5.0|Such a great book about love, lose, and moving on. It really opens your eyes on appreciation towards others. Highly recommended!!!
1609611543|5.0|I'll never look at wheat the same again.  Great read!  Already planning my new menus.  It won't be as tough to change as I thought.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|I am a country western lover, and this one is a winner. I like his sfyle, not trying to imitate anyone, just doing his own thing.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was not what I suspected.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  It also was a very fast read.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great show, and a great season. With so many characters it never gets boring and everything ties in perfectly. Highly recommended!
B00A2GQT5C|5.0|-I found that the composition of the music was wonderful.  I would have added several others of her music.  Some of these songs like For The Lovers I use in repetition for my walk on the tread mill and it makes the time fly.  It is sad that we lost her.  Highly recommended.
B008FOB124|1.0|I am honestly flabbergasted at all the glowing reviews of this album.  I began listening to DCD in the late 1980s, and for many years I considered them my favorite band.  As far as I was concerned, their music was the standard against which all others were judged.<br /><br />But I think Anastasis, in a word, stinks.  Whereas Brendan Perry's lyrics have always tended toward what I consider truly insightful philosophy, his lyrics on this album seem immature and downright silly.  And whereas Lisa Gerrard's vocals have always been generally mesmerizing, her songs here seem aimless and plodding, and I would swear she sounds positively bored.<br /><br />Like almost everybody else, I was excited at the prospect of a new DCD offering, but I think the time Brendan and Lisa have spent apart has changed them to the point where they no longer mesh well as musicians.  And after struggling through Anastasis with what I know must have been a look of disgusted disbelief throughout, I think they would have been much wiser had they stuck with the dissolution of 16 years ago and avoided this slow slide into mediocrity.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I saw it suggested that if people don't want their science fiction to be full of this bizarre, pointless sex, we must be repressed, but I love gay men, I love Barrowman, and this show is just dumb.  The stories make no sense and I wonder if Torchwood makes situations worse instead of better.  Gwen certainly does, and apparently she gets away with it because she's so good-looking -- seriously?  Seriously??!!!  Even if I thought she was really hot I wouldn't let her work in a place where she keeps screwing up and destroying lives because of her immaturity, immorality and idiocy.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I have purchased 2 screwdrivers and both have 4 sounds. And yes im talking about the 10th doctors screwdriver. Its sapposed to only have 2.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|I do not know how you would aid it right. it is better than nothing, i guess. good luck , you will need it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am shocked by the quality of this work. The characters, setting, plot, descriptions, tone, story content, pacing - everything was dead on. I am 100 % satisfied, and deeply saddened that i only have four more of these stories to read. Well done, Hugh Howie.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|Entertaining and intriguing.  I got caught right up in the story and couldn't put the book down.  A must-read for an fan of Philipa Gregory.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Its ok I'd rather play this than the candy game you have thank you for trting to keep my mins and time occupied
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in a matter of days. It did not disappoint, many twists and turns along the way, and the story always keeps you guessing.. I plan on reading more books by this author after reading this
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Avicii nailed it again!! Plus downloading with Amazon allows to burn a disc and use it in your CD player!
B00821OX98|3.0|just started watching so the jury is still out for me sometimes sci fi I can live with or with out for my tatse.if u are into that type of thing should be very enjoyable for ya
B00DQAM5LI|4.0|I'm a huge a7x fan and was really looking forward to this album.  One of the things that always drew me to their music was the complexity of the tunes plus that melody and hook that they seem to weave in there.  The Revs drumming was brilliant...one of the things I always focused on. When Portnoy did the last album the drumming was fantastic, the songs stayed fairly complex, and the album wasn't boring. Hail to The King is kind of a formula album to gain a wider audience. I love the tunes, don't get me wrong, but there is a lack of originality and complexity to this album.  Each song sounds like it is emulating a certain successful act. You have the Metallica sounding songs, the GnR song, the Megadeth and a little. Dream Theater style songs.  Unfortunately what I wasn't hearing was the Avenged Sevenfold style songs.  This will please many metal fans that weren't that into a7x previously.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I did not like this book. Don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't just people talking about the zombies in their towns.Kept hoping it would get better but never did.  Glad I didn't pay for this book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is an awesome challenging game.  Wveryone is playing it as well as candy crush safa and other Wooka games.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|i think it is a really awesome game, better than the first one. I like playing on the pork side. The only thing is, I wish when they say &#34;coming soon&#34; that is comes sooner.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Love Gotye! Not a bad song in the bunch. I bought this for one song and ended up loving the whole album.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|For anyone watching Expendables 2 and thinking it was a documentary than there is a strong likelihood that they are going to be disappointed.  For anyone who's been obsessing about what happens to the tabloid super heroes as they get older, that question is now answered.  A person looking for a diversion that has humor, action, a moral imperative and great stunts, this is your baby.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is so cool and deadly which is funny too me but it is a bad influence for children and kids our age
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I love this CD. I just happened to see the movie one day on TV not long after it came out, and flipped for Hugh Jackman right away. Then I fell in love with the story. It is a romantic comedy with just a touch of history tied into it. If you want a feel good movie, I highly recommend this one!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Amazing game thst has my eyes and mind wondering where is my next move. Great game but has nothi f on candy crush saga
B00F91RYL8|4.0|From beginning to end, unnerving! I was biting my nails through most of it wondering what crazy event would take place next. For someone who doesn't particularly enjoy this movie genre, I'd say this one hit the spot.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I loved this book. It rings true from the first word to the last. Thank you Steven for following your Call.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|My wife and I love this film. We watched it when are kids lived with us and we watched it after the kids moved out. Will watch it again sometime in the future.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Love John McClain.... not a great movie, but better than many...  Bruce Willis delivers on a great character he created...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Finally, the app that turns my rambling, wandering, unfocused Internet habits and endless curiosity about millions of things into a trail of breadcrumbs that I may easily follow.<br />Now I don't have to sync bookmarks, check. my notes, email, phone, etc.<br />All the info is always available all the time.<br />I cannot believe it took me so long to adopt this!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Entertaining and suspenseful in the first half, but over-long and slow-moving toward the end. Little chemistry between the two love interests. Not enough character development to make you believe either would care about the other. Mark Ruffalo's character spends half the movie insulting his leading lady and the other half looking like an idiot. The \\"surprise ending\\" does not make up for two hours with this twit. The ridiculous motivation for the \\"behind the scenes\\" figure who orchestrated things is disappointing and unbelievable. Where would they get the time and money for all that? No other characters are developed or explored. The tricks get less plausible as the story progresses.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The fun lost someone. The bad would find him. The bad would know ok<br /><br />So many  court loopholes are used.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Terrible movie. Terrible plot. Too much CGI. Running zombies?? You could have done so much better Brad Pitt. Read the book instead.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great start to the trilogy.Kept me interested til the end. The author had the ability to make me feel apart of the story and that's what I look for in a book.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|This movie could have been great... the Zombies were truly terrifying... however, the set up was weak... (life is normal one second and the next Zombies everywhere...)... no explanation for how or why...  and the &#34;solution&#34; was really stupid and underwhelming...<br /><br />Could have been so much better.. as it is, just a bad zombie movie...
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|just love this band, and another great album. Derek and Susan tear it up. Can't wait for the next one
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I watched the movie with my three daughters (12, 11, 8), who love horses. They loved it. It prompted us to research more on Secretariat, but more importantly we talk about reality of a dream, and when it is worth taking risks.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I haven't used this a lot, but it seems to work fairly well. I would rather work with Office stuff on my laptop, but this makes it pretty convenient to access them on-the-go.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie was so fun to watch very creative and sweet message that love can change the hardest of hearts
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun i play it on xbox and its fun but now i can play it anywhere i go. I highly recommend it to everyone
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The characters are interesting.  Each show has information and ties you into the next.  You look forward to finding out what happens next.  I have watched all through season 3 and look forward to the next season.  A must see program.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very convenient to have on the Kindle. I use it to help my son with vocab homework on the go.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Do not buy this DVD!!!  Sound was terrible and parts were not audible at all!  Picture far from blue ray quality!!!
B004SDEP38|3.0|This program allows me to work with Office documents on my tablet. Seems to work pretty well; haven't had any real issues.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Great plot and captivating story-telling. A fantastic read that I got through in less than 2 days because I just couldn't put the books down!
B003VANOFY|2.0|this headset looks crappy. and I cannot , I have to adapt to it because I cannot have another option
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of those shows I cannot anticipate next move. Love the show and the dynamics is the characters. Must watch.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is the most useful types of To Do Lists, Grocery List, Task List that I have found. It is great because it emails to myself or others like a memo that does it all, you know like a handy Swiss Army Knife. This app does it all as far as keeping one organized. If you need to keep up with multi lists and keep organized, may I suggest to you this app!
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I've read it now it's time to test it.  I'll update my review after my first pitch with this technique... Wait for it!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is  awesome it makes me feel powerful and cool.  it has charms weapons. and suits. it is 2 awesome. cool
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My grand niece absolutely loved it. We had to read it over and over. Worth every cent. We want more books like this one.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|First time go. It's free. That's unbelievable.<br />If you like angry birds or star wars or are bored, get it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Scary,fantastic pacing, innovative, not gory, & wonderful acting & cinematography.  Amazing simulations of cities swarming & roiling with manic, Olympic-gold-sprinting zombies.  Brad Pitt nailed it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This item represents one of the best if not most superior search engines in the world. Keep up the good work.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Who ever rated this movie 1 star needs their head examined. This was a great film that we found quite riveting
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This installment took a much darker tone than the first two did, but I feel that in doing so it progressed the story to a place that the others couldn't.  It reminded me of the animated movie that came out in the 80s.  Overall, a great movie!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I enjoy listening to this on my kindle when I have. Quiet time.  All I need is the scent of lavender. And I will be set!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just got a Sumsung Galaxy S4 and reading using my Kindle app on it is easier than using my old Kindle!
B0086DB566|5.0|This is a wonderful version of the classic fairytale, told mostly from the Queen's perspective, even at times as she narrates the story. Julia Roberts is surpassing all others as she sarcastically & acerbically delivers her lines. Lilly Collins seems to me to be what Audry Hepburn would have done with this story had she had the chance. Collins even manages to pull off her classic look as well. Lots of great humor, poignancy & fun keep this movie fresh & enjoyable. I've seen it 3 times now & not in the least does it loose it's magic. I would say this is far more an adult retelling although kids may still enjoy it. Of course, the guy gets the girl in the end & that is all that really matters.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|This browser needs some work. At times it becomes hard to use and fails to reach expectations of Chrome or Firefox.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Like to keep up with friends!!!  Great way to stay in touch with friends out of town.  Thumbs up for fb
B003L77GRO|5.0|This show is awesome. I have seasons 1-5 so far. I will definitely get the full series. I just love it!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was fairly interesting. It definitely expressed the plight of the women who end up in prison. I suppose I was expecting something different.
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|I read the review of BJ in Vanity Fair and was struck by a remark either in the review or in a comment: Allen is &#34;cruel to his characters.&#34;<br /><br />First of all, let's remind ourselves that being cruel to fictional people is not the same as being cruel to real people. Second, to be kind to a fictional character is often to deny &#34;hard love&#34; to one's audience - by failing to play out the consequences of certain bad character traits and some evil or stupid decisions.<br /><br />Another remark I noted was that Allen &#34;offers no catharsis.&#34; Perhaps Classical Greek drama could offer release of a kind  to its audience because their legendary settings were even then a bit removed from the audience's everyday lives (as perhaps dramas set in the US South are removed from the daily lives of Northeasten and West Coast elites). Why should Allen be supplying &#34;closure&#34; like a sleeping pill?<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Three things struck me about Jasmine/Jeanette French:<br /><br />1) how she dropped her university schooling merely to marry some man who had &#34;future of untold wealth&#34; written in lemon juice across his handsome face with its winning smile. Her major was anthropology, which, if you are a frivolous person, is often just a playing at a colonial fantasy ;<br /><br />2) what really upset her about her husband. It wasn't his criminality. It was his cheating on her - and, perhaps more importantly his doing so with increasing indiscretion. One complicating factor is that in the affair that broke the camel 's back, Hal was claiming he was in love with a French au pair. That provokes not a few questions about him and his attitude to Jasmine. And how lightning swift was her call to the FBI! The verb &#34;resorting&#34; cannot even be used.<br /><br />3) the reference to &#34;genes&#34; being the advantage that Jeanette has always had over her sister. &#34;Aryan&#34; vs. &#34;Semite&#34;/&#34;Mediterranean&#34; perhaps? Need we go THERE, now that we've trashed capitalism American-style?
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I especially love this movie since it was partially filmed where I work. Great special effects. Can't wait for the next movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Lots of fun playing this game. It is not to hard or too easy. I just have time to kill but do not want to think about it.
0739352989|5.0|This is my first audiobook.  I enjoyed the novels so much that I decided to take plunge and take it on the road.
B003Q6D2B4|1.0|I love this movie. Bruce Willis at his best. I love his love interest - she dreams of having an exciting life so unlike the one she has and then when it drops in her lap, suddenly its not so great. But over time she warms to it and by the end...woops, dont want to spoil it.<br /><br />John Malkovich is wonderful as Rain Man meets Get Smart, and I think I fell in love with Helen Mirren; even though I saw her years ago as DCI Tenison in Prime Suspect, I never saw her as attractive or even particularly female til now.<br /><br />Cant wait for RED2.<br /><br />CAUTION: the DvD wont play in computers; so if thats how you watch movies you'll need to get the movie some other way.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a mother I can&#34;t imagine going through what this family did. The ending is unbelieveable and really makes you think about what you would do.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|Disclaimer: I've never read the book.<br />Character development was almost non-existent.  Horrible cinematography, special effects were good and the zombie actors were great, but those things can only go so far. Redundant audio special effects didn't help either.  Movie started out well, a little over dramatic, good story background but that's where it ended.  The rest of the movie was a never ending shaky cam mockumentary of Brad Pitt running.  I like this genre a lot, but it was a struggle to keep my eyes open for this one.
0385344333|5.0|I wanted this (Wanted Man) by Lee Child and could not find it in the stores As usual I really enjoyed it..  .
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This is a classic with great music and a fun story but crazy story.  We got this for our 10 year old grand daughter.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|High action, edge of seat, nail biting movie.  I say if you have a weak heart don't watch it or take a break now and again to get your blood pressure back to normal. Seriously it is a fun ride, scary thought and intense but well done movie.  I loved the special effects and still can't figure out how they were done. Loved Brad Pitt in this one. Excellent.
B00AEFY6ZQ|2.0|...hate the DvD.<br /><br />Hatari is my favorite John Wayne movie. Adorable, exciting, even cute. And I like Hardy Krueger and Red Buttons characters too.<br /><br />My late father used to say \\"you can stop any John Wayne movie and start a different John Wayne movie at the same point and it would mesh seamlessly\\". This was the movie I would always use to refute that.<br /><br />But the DvD wont play in my laptop; you know, the way most people watch movies nowadays. I had to dig my old DvD player out and hook it up to the TV. PITA. Typical greedy Hollywood attitude: screw em, they're just customers, who needs 'em.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|So good.  I was smiling and satisfied at the end, even with how tragic it technically was.  It was less bogged down than The House at Riverton.  It was long, but never felt that way because the entire time tiny pieces were being revealed!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just finished season 2 of Downton Abbey and ready to go to season 3. When we have finished season 3 I will be ready for the new season that starts in January 2014. I did not see the series when it first aired but I am glad I am watching the 3 previous seasons. I will be ready for what ever comes in season 4 when it airs.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Referring to the Star Trek franchise of course. I go all the way back to watching the original first run episodes of the original series. Over forty five years ago!? I have checked out just about all the Star Trek spin-offs along the way. From the very good (Star Trek TNG) to awful (most of the first series of Shatner/Nimoy Star Trek films, except for the funny one with the whales). On the whole, I'm glad to see Star Trek still truckin' along. It has been a constant in my life for so long.<br /><br />As to this film, well how many decades has it been now since so many blockbuster films have starred special effects, stunt doubles, model makers, and blue screens? As film after film has tried to surpass the last in action sequences, I long ago lost interest. When all the spectacle was over, the good guys still won.<br /><br />It's still the characters and the relationships between them that determine whether a film is really any good or not. So I'm happy to say that this film is good. Seeing the original Star Trek characters portrayed by different actors at a different time is fun. And it's done with sufficient humor and well-acted pathos to keep your interest.<br /><br />If someone were completely unfamiliar with the world of Star Trek, I don't think that that person would enjoy the film much, except in so far as they love gigantic action sequences featuring lots of destruction and last second escapes from disaster. Their are lots of inside jokes and references to the future adventures of the crew of the Enterprise. (I have always liked the touch with which Federation ships were given the names of former US Navy ships from earlier centuries. Starting with the Enterprise, the greatest ship of the Second World War. A lot of people probably thought that the space shuttle &#34;Enterprise&#34; was named after the Star Trek ship. In fact, maybe it was.)<br /><br />I don't know why I took the time to write this review. With hundreds of other reviews, this one may be read bytwo people. So I will end it.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Effects were great but the story with the evil eastern block was predictable. Father son relationship wasn't believable so<br />it was difficult to care what happened to them. This was no &#34;Die Hard.&#34;
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Its a pretty good movie despite the zombies. So it rates the Best Zombie movie ever!!  Brad Pitt does a great job. Can't wait for sequel!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game fun to play. Definitely if you like animals and you want to take care of them. So download this game if you do.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I can't add anything to the positive reviews to this excellent film.<br /><br />My focus in this review more of an observation of the Relationship between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisabeth Salander as presented in the movie.<br /><br />As many has noted, Lisabeth's relationships with men ranges from nice/normal to hate/contempt (in all cases, she has her reasons)!<br /><br />What struck me was the result of her first (physical) encounter with Mikael.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />She fixed him breakfast!<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />She REALLY LIKED THIS (particular) MAN!<br /><br />What struck me even more was the scene where (a)Lisabeth took her pleasure from him even as he was trying to have a discussion with her and (b)when it took a minute for her head to clear...I found that amusing...that is....SHE took HIM.  Earlier when Mikael first employed Lisabeth, we are treated to a scene where Lisabeth's in bed with another woman...<br /><br />Where am I going with this?  Simple.<br /><br />After all the domination by men (good or bad), she gets a chance to dominiate (and boy, does she) men!<br /><br />But she really LIKES Mikael.  The significant scene was when she visited her former guardian (who apparently suffered a very serious stroke - as he can't talk or move) and tells him about Mikael as if they had some kind of \\"normal\\" future together.<br /><br />Mikael obviously had a different view of their relationship.<br /><br />Mikael went back to his married co-worker - and his former life.<br /><br />I sat there and said to myself, what an idiot, I would've taken Lisabeth on the spot - yes, she had piercings and tattoos, but she was also very, very bright and loyal (note: loyal) and already had proven herself to him that she was there whenever he needed her.<br /><br />And he walked away from her.<br /><br />It made me cringe even more whenever I see that 'present' tossed into the trash...what a waste...but that's life?<br /><br />Sometimes the best things are right in front of us...clich&eacute;...but true.<br /><br />Well, that's my take from this excellent film!<br /><br />I (and many, many) others rate Girl with a Dragon Tattoo...Five stars!of us...clich&eacute;...but true.<br /><br />Well, that's my take from this excellent film!<br /><br />I (and many, many) others rate Girl with a Dragon Tattoo...Five stars!
B0082RHRHC|1.0|I have downloaded two free editions of Jane Eyre and both have several pages missing.  I am able to read one or two pages and then there are one or two blank pages. The dialogue is lost so that it is difficult yo follow the story.  This is extremely disappointing and I can see why the books are free.<br />abcox@sbcglobal.net

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for any one who does not own their own horse. This is a great game for for kids.

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is totally addictive! So much fun! I play it all the time and  have become very quick and sharp bc of  it!  Love it!!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is not a drop proof cover but it does just what I need to protect my Kindle, it tilts the Kindle up for reading,  but it has problems slipping out of the little notch for the money it does a great job.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is so good it took me so long to finally let go of the book. It has adventure romance and death. When I was done with it I could not wait to start the 2nd book.<br />Mw017687
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book brought me a lot of solace.  I really hope this is an accurate view of things because it provides one hope.  Also, being a perpetual student in this life, I love the idea of continuing education in the next world!  The case studies were very interesting, and the doctor's conclusions were for the most part consistent with the case studies.
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|This book really made me think about what I would do...  Cecelia is living her wonderful  life, and after fifteen perfect years of marriage discovers a &#34;mistake&#34; her husband made before they were even married. The struggles Cecelia faces with her conscience and how the &#34; right thing to do&#34; would effect her children and life as she knew it makes you examine your own conscience. What would I really do if I were put in the same situation? I hope I never have to find out!<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Liane Moriarty and it definitely won't be my last!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Great movie it was nice to see &#34;old men and women&#34; kick some younger peoples booty.  Show is filled with action and humor to go along with it and a moral.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The wheather previsions aire typically accurate. I do not look at the ads  and the  format seems fine even though I Nevers user the previous app so can,t compare... I do bave batteries issues but not sure it is from this app. The good thing is I wake up, use the app to know how to dress for the day and it is g&eacute;n&eacute;rally correct for the day...
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|brilliant work written by a script writer for the movie! A fast moving a gipping story across continents. I thoprughly enjoyed reading it
B00985E3UG|5.0|Now when I walk into a seven eleven I will be more cognizant of what I am buying .  I am shocked at what goes on behind the closed doors of Kellogg and Kraft foods.  Although after reading the book I started drinking Dr . Pepper again.  It is really the most challenging to give up soda.
B000HKYN74|5.0|Recommend to anyone who likes star trek and the stories that go long with all the star treks series  ..very cool
B00ECUARO8|2.0|ok, the acting was good but I thought the storyline was slow and boring.  I love McConaughey and I realize this wasn't going to be a romantic film but it could have had more action

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I wasn't looking forward to reading about a patient with what looked like a terminal disease, but I'm so glad I kept on reading.  I learned so much about what such patients go through and what my response could (should) be.
B009RH973I|3.0|I can't rate this because I accidentally ordered the wrong kind.  I only needed the Kindle Fire not HD. I thought I'd really like this but my whole order got all messed up, I emailed people about it and never got any response.
B0072IS13G|5.0|I love Schleich's animals. This dragon is no exception. My girls LOVE dragons and this one has gotten a lot of use. Being Schleich, it's super well-made and the details are intricate. We've not played with the rider much, but the dragon has been much loved and still looks fabulous -- as I'm sure it will for . . . well, forever. :)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love this book. Have only done 4 experiments and my life has turned around for the better.<br />I have also bought 5 more and given them to friends and family.<br />Thank you Pam Grout!

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Arrived in excellent condition, I hope so, it was brand new! Haven't watched it, I've seen ALL of them, but I needed this in my collection. I can't wait for it to come back on in OCT!
B0072IUZUS|5.0|My two girls absolutely love dragons and over the past year, this one has gotten a lot of play. Being Schleich, it's super well-made and absolutely beautiful in the details. The rider hasn't been played with much, but the dragon, after a year, still looks like new. I love that this one looks so friendly, as opposed to some of the other toy dragons out there.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is my go to alarm clock now. It is great. For this price you cannot go wrong. Get it. It wakes me everytime I need a wakeup call. I especially like the way the alarm starts off at a low volume and over a few minutes, it goes to full volume which is substantial. It is also very easy to set the alarm to a different time even when you are extremely tired and having a hard time keeping your eyes open. It is a great alarm clock.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I had to just keep reading to see how this story ended. I was back and forth all of the time. Is he guilty? Is he innocent? I love a book like that! You won't be disappointed after reading this novel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very reliable source of information. Thoroughly but easy explained so that everyone can read it and understand it. I love it
B0019LZV4E|5.0|i really liked it.  i uually don't like musicals but I really liked the story lines in it.  All the cast went well together.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Overall a good read.  It's rather difficult to follow in the beginning as it jumps from character to character that you don't know anything about. Part way through the characters start to come together and it starts making sense. It has a rather abrupt ending as well.
B000006L7G|5.0|I bought this for my dad.  Found it was really hard to find so went to Amazon and it was delivered in excellent condition.  That it was 2 CD was a bonus
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|NOT EVEN MARK RUFFALO AND MORGAN FREEMAN CAN SAVE THIS SPECIAL EFFECTS-LADEN STINKER OF A MOVIE. Not even Mark Ruffalo and Morgan Freeman can save this special effects-laden stinker of a movie. When is Hollywood going to realize that bad storytelling is the reason all their blockbusters fail? The movie begins with a shaky plot foundation of four magicians being summoned by a shady character to begin extravagent performances under the never-fully-explained and hard to fathom premise that they will get inducted into an elite magician's club called \\"The Eye.\\" Not to introduce any spoilers here, but if you rent this movie you are embarking on a pointless journey towards a disappointing, contrived and completely unrealistic ending. Don't waste your time.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I purchased this Blu-ray/DVD combo, because I am already familiar w/the movie in all of it's cheesiness and goodness. :-)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show - excellent portrayal of the characters by the actors.  Can't get enough - makes you want to keep watching one episode after another
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is a great movie.  I've always loved it from the first time I saw it in the theatre.  Now my children love it.  A great storyline that is fun and exciting.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|The game is fun, but VERY frustrating. I think okay but bad at the same time. Buyers if you get this game you will say the same.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game<br />My kids really enjoyed playing and its not too hard for my four year old. Great graphics as well.
B005M0R4X4|4.0|Would have given this a 5 star if it had included the Christmas special.  I thought that I had read in the reviews that it was included, but sad to say it was not...<br />Definitely, enjoyed the series!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's ok. I like it but it is not my favorite. It may be your favorite. I like Mahjong type games better.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It was a well written fable. I just cannot put the book down. I loved the TV shows as well.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|enjoyed the book. delivered in a timely manner.thanks! These reviews are a pain in the behind. I probably will not participate again in the future.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I absolutely love this games. Its so much fun and I love the so many different character choices. I cant wait for more levels.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|this one's a keeper!  Unexpectadly, in this story, the woman is the emotionally unavailable one!  The movie is well cast and easy to love!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's OK. I am not very good at Bingo. Nothing wrong with it. It is a good game. Maybe you will like it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed this app. Great challenge!  Not so difficult that it is frustrating and not so easy that it's boring.  I look forward to many  more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game and I have become addicted to playing it daily. My 11 year old daughter also enjoys playing this game.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Where do I begin?<br /><br />I heavily listened to (and loved, and still do) PHM, Broken, and TDS (and everything else of those eras) throughout middle school and high school (having come to the conclusion at age 12 that NIN was my favorite band ever--and never wavering on that since). The Fragile was the first album I had the chance to get right when it came out. I still remember Tuesday, 9/21/1999: a friend of my mine skipped 2nd hour to go to Best Buy to pick it up, and during the passing period between 2nd and 3rd hour another friend and I found him so we could ooh and ahh over the goods. I can still picture him solemnly opening up the case to us like a priest opening a bible, and we bemoaned aloud the 6 more hours we had to wait before going to buy it ourselves.<br /><br />The day Hesitation Marks was leaked felt a lot like that day. This album doesn't SOUND much like TF, to me, but my feelings surrounding it are strikingly similar. The anticipation, the lip-chewing impatience, the frequent analysis of the songs that had already been heard, complete with furrowed brow and \\"but where did this come from? how does this fit in?\\" questions swirling. The quiet, soothing relief upon hearing it at last, letting each track wash over you, knowing that while it may take repeated listening to truly sink in, and though it's not exactly the record you expected, it's exactly the record that Trent needed to make at that time.<br /><br />I had similar feelings of tingly excitement about With Teeth when its first songs debuted (and then when it leaked) - hell, my first dance at my wedding was to All The Love In The World - but this album is VERY different from WT or anything else since; more polished, steady, restrained, real. I love everything Trent has done almost without fail, so while I can't \\"rank\\" this one among his others (I still can't even pick out a personal favorite album--perhaps Broken for its raw power, but considering its brevity, maybe TDS instead?), HM really does feel like the proper \\"next step\\" after The Fragile, even (and especially) with everything that has transpired in between.<br /><br />For everyone that's not quite on board with HM yet: let's not forget that when TF came out, there were many who had an initial reaction of feeling that it was too sprawling, bloated, repetitive, whiny, or simply somewhat baffling. It seems its sonic genius was just more of a grower than a shower (ahem) for many, as evidenced by how many fans name it as a favorite today. HM appears to be starting off on that same foot: strong, but surprising--but clearly packed with talent, thrills, ingenuity, depth, defiance, and chutzpah.<br /><br />For me, it only required a few listens to fully grip me and earn my adoration. The first time: \\"Whoa. This is...whoa. Interesting...\\" The second time: \\"Yes. Yes, I do like this.\\" By the third time: chills, goosebumps, and the inability to get any work done because I HAVE to hear again, right now. I won't comment too much on technical musical details (I don't feel qualified to do so) or the narrative, but here some initial personal/subjective feelings about each track...<br /><br />The Eater of Dreams: The tension building throughout is palpable, confusion leading to terror. Those of you that said it sounds like waking up in a hospital are dead-on; now I'll likely always hear it that way. GREAT intro, and just the right length.<br />Copy of A: Thanks to its live appearances, I already knew I liked this one, though I do still have a minor qualm with the silly-feeling \\"that doesn't sound like fun\\" lyric. Despite that little nitpick, this is a perfect post-intro opener, thanks in large part to its excellent buildup and breakdown.<br />Came Back Haunted: I know many people didn't/don't love this one, but I personally dug it from the first listen. (The video, though, is another story...) I still think it's downright delicious; lots of tasty textures to bite into.<br />Find My Way: I was a bit bored by the live version, but I think I like its album treatment better. It fits.<br />All Time Low: Whoa! This one came as a surprise, but I soon found myself bopping back and forth involuntarily. I like the unexpected (to me) styles of vocal delivery. The last couple minutes sounds like you're floating around (perhaps a little like Aaron North in the old Meathead cartoons?) inside a trippy video game.<br />Disappointed: Again, I already enjoyed the live version, and the album version lives up.<br />Everything: I completely understand the feelings of everyone who hates this song, but after repeated listens, I finally got into its groove. I'm enjoying it in the context of the whole album, particularly lyrically. It's still a little too poppy for me to love, but I like the noisiness and incongruity with its surroundings.<br />Satellite: Whoa again! Funky! The end of this song is where the album really takes off for me, pummeling the listener with soaring emotion through gritted teeth until the end.<br />Various Methods of Escape: YES. Just yes. There's something of Every Day Is Exactly the Same in this. That smoky atmosphere that drifts in at the beginning...I just...and man, what a hook. Definitely one of my two favorites at this point.<br />Running: Love it. (Anyone else notice that \\"running\\" may be one of \\"various methods of escape\\" possible?) Another winning chorus...feels like it's sliding by, inviting you to grab hold and let it take you with it. I love the harried, panicked note it ends on.<br />I Would For You: I'm not a crier, but the second time I listened to this, I teared up big time within the first 20 seconds. Something about it. Hard to find words. Right now, this is my other favorite.<br />In Two: Abrasive, aggressive, mechanical-yet-human (the two sides to Trent's same coin?). Cool guitar work buried in there. Something I can't pinpoint vaguely brings The Becoming to mind.<br />While I'm Still Here: Not gonna lie--I'm not liking the sax. Other than that, though, it's a great closer, and though it's not brash by any means, it doesn't feel as mellow as his usual album endings. It's tenser, less of a reflective exhale.<br />Black Noise: Unexpectedly brief. Leaves me unsettled and wanting more.<br /><br />In sum, I have some powerful, positive feelings about HM, and I can't wait to listen to it 200 more times and explore it (and said feelings) in greater depth. It feels like the right album at the right time, and - despite how it may seem at first listen to some - so very Trent.e version, but I think I like its album treatment better.

B0060V1WJ6|5.0|A solid and meaningful story told in a humorous way.  Ryan Gosling and Steve Carrell make a great duo.  I've seen this movie twice and enjoyed it even more the second time around.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|great purchase for great price. would buy again if available. great delivery system. great app download. very good online purchase experience
0425166805|5.0|Years  ago  I  read  this  and  over  the  years  lost  it .  It  was  time  to  get a new  copy  and  reread  this  all  and  mark  it  up  as  did  years  ago.  We  are not  alone  ,  they  have  away been  around .  It  is  easy  to  read  and  a  short  book,  but  questions  are  there  for  people.  What  will  you do  when  they  return.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|I don't really understand how they manage to put so many riffs in their songs. Most bands nowadays would have made at least two albums out of the riffs in this one. God bless Kadavar. Ridiculously good.
B0064MGU98|5.0|We really like The Good Wife! Keeps us watching every night. Good story lines and very realistic. We highly recommend watching it.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I must be doing too much reading, but this one seemed like it was pretty formulaic (sp?)  Intertwined lives going their separate ways and coming back together, justice in the end.  The Husband's Secret is a good time filler.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Another dark story. Great read. I would highly recommend if you are a Flynn fan. Ending was a shock. The family was one you felt so many emotions for.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Great new work by Vampire Weekend. One of the best albums I've heard this year. Favorite tracks: Ya Hey, Don't Lie, Step, Hannah Hunt.

B005OT2YVA|4.0|Although there is not a lot of connection in trama between all three movies, this last one had pretty good action.
0762439009|2.0|When I opened the box the magnet and shirt patch were missing. I looked through everything, I even found a toe with nail polish, but no magnet or shirt patch. I should send it back, in hopes that I get the kit as described.<br />They also failed to answer my messages.

B000J1AGQI|5.0|Doing the right thing under adverse circumstances because it's right.  The movie does a superb job of showing the honor of both the soldier and the spouse.  The spouse often has the harder situation.  Great job!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|top notch like all of the Rovio games.  I do have an issue on my kindle fire with pixelation  or artifacts in the game, it is not constant but it is annoying
B002W7H3EA|5.0|It is a classic. I love Alfred Hitchcock mysteries. Cary grant is superb in this role. The plot has you at the edge of your seat.

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I am an adult and the girls at work and I had a ball with this. We would get to laughing and Tom would laugh which made us laugh more and we couldn't stop. My grandsons really like it too, this is fun for any age, just hilarious. Everyone needs a good laugh once in a while.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Upgrades my collection from vhs to disc. My vhw player is dead and now I can satisfy the itch for original Star Trek.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this series.  Season 2 gives you more background to the characters.  It gives you a good view of the justice system as well as a behind the seen look at politics.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't put it down!! I even got it on audio version so that when I was driving and couldn't actually read it, I could listen to it!  Good book!
B0086700CM|2.0|While I like most games, this one is simply way to fast and doesn't seem to have an ending.  But I am sure a lot of people probably like a run on game.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|This app keeps everything organized and allows you simple and great options for each notebook you create... it's perfect for home and school....
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Way too much time spent on battles, too much death and destruction. The ending felt just tacked on, not really part of the story. Would have liked more attention to people setting things to rights after the sealing of the bore.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|This really was a great movie. I really enjoy the people the cast for it and look forward to seeing more with them...The only reason I gave it a 4 star was Kahn...to me the person picked for the part just didn't fit...just my opinion...he did a great job acting...I give him that...just did not have the look. I think this movie series could have a great future to it though overall.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Liane Moriarty has an uncanny ability to touch our most inner emotions with mere words.  I couldn't put the book down because of the mysterious secret but more because of her understanding of the human heart.  An excellent read.
B000ID37T0|5.0|It is well put together very funny and realistic. Has a gripping story I have watched it more than once and will again, I recommend scent of a woman to any adult
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I love this app. I like how it bounces off the walls. Why? Cause it makes a good beat and I should know because I play the drums whoop whoooop!!!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|You have to appreciate the novella-like brevity with which Neil Gaiman creates a world, takes you through it, and leaves you thinking when you're done.  Sometimes I crave mega novels, but sometimes the Gaiman-esque brief dip into Otherplaces is enough.  This one was enough--and a delightful read for the duration.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh John Green, how did you take two teenagers and pack the meaning of life and love into a few months of their star-crossed lives?<br /><br />I was warned, and it's a book about a girl with cancer, for goodness sake. I expected to cry at the end. I didn't expect to cry through the last quarter of the book.<br /><br />This one will stay with me for a long time. Thank you for the ride.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I fell in love with this show after watching Season 1 on Netflix.  Season 2, started off slow, but ends with a huge bang.  I can not wait til season 3 starts.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was excellent. As an avid reader I rarely find book that I don't want to end, since I read so much and a lot books are crap in my opinion. This was detailed, personal and most of the chapters gave me chills.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's between okay and like it. I don't know if you will like it because some of them are really hard and I'm stuck on level something I can't remember. I would advise not to get it. I think I'm going to delete it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|At first I was uncertain if this book was for me, but the more I read the  more I liked.  I recommend this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It ia very good however it starts out a little slow, but most books do this. Towards the end it gets really juicy so I really recommend it!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Bedside alarm clock  by AppAnnex, LLC is better. this one only gives you set times at 15 minute intervals to choose from. the other AppAnnex lets you put it at any time, and you can display it in 24 hr (military time) also if needed. this one is lame.
0880796863|5.0|Very good starter deck or for the more experienced reader who likes a clean simple deck. Money well spent on this set.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I like it because it's cool the features are awesome but the one thing is that I'm stuck on a level that is hard.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's fun there's monsters animals and all made out of  blocks you can mine it may cost 7 dollars but it's totally worth it there's mountains villages swords mods and a lot of other cool stuff
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So I downloaded this for something to do, and it is a fun and addictive game. It loads fine for me, no glitches and is easy to figure out. Only issue I have with it is 1. you can only accumulate up to 40 coins before you have to buy more or wait a minute and a half to get another one, and 2. half the prizes end up falling off the edges, the perk of getting the wall up doesn't last very long. other than those things I'd highly recommend it. My kids love it too.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Starts  out great. Recently it just flashes a white screen and never loads. Maybe it needs another update? Also the ads are worse now.
B00CD4RPWM|5.0|Fills in some blanks and helps introduce outlander to newbies while giving the rest of us something to do until the new book comes out....
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I deleted it cause I already had one but my sis told me it's really cool and it is cool.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Though R. Scott is credited as the 'Producer' & 'Director,' this is NOT a \\"Ridley Scott Film\\" . . . in comparison to R. Scott's actual masterpieces:  Prometheus' overall direction and cinematography lacks his visionionary expertise; the film's lighting contains none of his expert use of light (a major R. Scott trademark); the musical soundtrack contains zero suspense (another true R. Scott trademark; miss you J. Goldsmith); the script is painfully too 'wordy'; the acting is shallow/wooden (zero empathy for the characters); and it lacks the genius momentum of a true R. Scott sci-fi masterpiece (Alien, Aliens, Blade Runner . . . )  Unfortunately, by allowing his name to be associated with such an amature production, especially since it's clear he merely lent his name to it to secure its production/release, it appears he's abandonded his visionary integrity and expertise.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I sent Seasons 1 & 2 of Game of Thrones to my sister, so she could catch up and be prepared for Season 4.  She loved Game Of Thrones.  She caught season 3 ON DEMAND.  When the 4th season begins in the spring, we can talk about it.

B0031RS8AI|5.0|This is a really great book  - a page turner. I loved Becky. It was like reading about me and I love shopping. I could totally identify with the heroine in this case. This is the same book as Confessions of a Shopaholic so be warned! Have to say the book is much better than the film but I did enjoy the film too.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl is slow and predictable. I thought that the characters were poorly developed and just largely unbelievable. The end made me wish that I hadn't spent the time reading this book.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Unless you travel and stay at hotels frequently, I encourage you to wait for the next generation.  This first release does not give you anything your HD TV or Blu-Ray disc player doesn't already provide.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i am addicted to the trilogy. it was a really nice romantic story, even though christian gray is messed up in his head. once i started reading this i could not put it down. the sex scenes are not for everyone but if you like to experiment in bed then you will appreciate the tips.

B00DXP0QX0|5.0|This is a collection of Rod Stewarts music that was done in a time when I liked the recordings that he did. Not lavish productions. Simpler and much better.
0425263924|5.0|This was a very good book. Liked it better than 50 Shades. If you liked that book you will enjoy this also.
B002U9JEVA|5.0|I love the sound of Norah Jones' voice and I think her work is great.  Chasing Pirates is my favorite song on the album.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I enjoyed the first one in this new series of films and this one proves to be more in depth, building on previous relationships (Spock and Uhuru for instance) and the twists and turns that kept me guessing what was going to happen next.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Best new movie I've seen in awhile!  Instense, keeps you glued to the screen.  Pitt was awsome and great actors overall.  This is at the top of my movie all time favorites list.
0425263916|5.0|If you liked 50 shades you will enjoy reading this series also.  Did enjoy reading this series.  Couldn't put it down.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Even though you can predict some parts, it still held my interest and had a few twists that were good.  Overall I enjoyed the movie.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This was a pretty good film all in all. The revelation of the true nature of the situation and the unfolding revelation of the secrets made for a good story.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hate this app.  You cannot order the newsfeed or manipulate it in anyway.  I'll have updates from 3-4 days ago intermixed with stuff from 2 hours ago.  It just out and out doesn't give some updates at all.  I won't even use it.  You are driving people to twitter & instagram with this app.  Facebook is becoming an app for people on computers instead of smart phones/tablets.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is very addicting!  Downside at this point, when trying to purchase items using coins or real money game freezes.  Shuts down and you lose prize and money.  PLEASE FIX THIS.  Otherwise great game.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock weaves a fine tale of Suspense and intrigue. Cary Grant stars in another Hitchcock thriller.  Parts of the Movie were filmed in Monaco, which would become the future home of the Actress a few years later after she married Prince Rainer.  A true classic.  It ages well and is just as good today as it was when it first came out.
0307454568|5.0|I liked this book and was glad to able to continue  reading the series.<br />I would recomend this company to anyone looking for used books.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series reminds me of the American series, &#34;Little House On The Prairie&#34;  I would like to see it last forever.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|His brand of comedy is fun, and I adore his making fun of everything an everyone. He is honest, and he is sweet. But he doesn't try to save face in any way.
B000007VLL|5.0|Holding our for a Hero, It is Bonnie at her best.  The Album is very enjoyable to listen too while driving home from work.
B008BD9SI8|4.0|I'm a fan of Abercombie and share his black sense of humor in the rather gruesome society full of doubting anti-heroes and conscienceless villains he created. His style is ironic, direct and to the point. The story of a hunt for stolen children takes you through all dimensions of human misbehavior. I'm certainly going read both other books of this trilogy.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|It was interesting that they went back to one of my favorite Star Trek movies, 'Wrath of Khan' and did a remake.  I love this new crew, the action is great, the special effects fantastic and the story line.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|First off I want to make one thing clear. You can NOT compare one Nine Inch Nails album to another. One is not better than another. They are all their own beast. They do, however, have small aspects of each other. That is called the Nine Inch Nails sound. It's like a family who are related but each person has their own unique personality. This is what makes Nine Inch Nails so great. So don't expect The Downward Spiral or The Fragile part two from Trent. Not going to happen.<br /><br />Now on to the specifics of this album...<br /><br />The first time I heard this album was a few days before it came out. I was playing Warcraft and streaming Hesitation Marks from Youtube. To be honest, I thought it was horrible. I was sure Trent had reached the end and gone crazy. The album started strong with Copy Of A and Come Back Haunted but went down hill after that. A few days later after its release I was at Target trying to find some new music. Then I saw Hesitation Marks on the shelf. Suddenly I felt a strong urge to buy it and give it another chance. I am glad I did.<br /><br />Now the only song I dislike is All Time Low. I think the verse part sounds a little to funky and out there. However, the chorus is amazing. The more I listen to it though, the more I like all of it.<br /><br />The song Everything (the most controversial song on the album) made me stop what I was doing and just stare at my speakers. Not in a bad way. Just in shock that Trent would make a song that sounded... happy? But then the chorus kicked in and it all made sense. It's not my favorite song, but it is good.<br /><br />Another song, Satellite, had a Year Zero vibe to it. That is a good thing to me but doesn't fit here. That is my only complaint and it is nothing major.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the new album. While I am a big fan of Nine Inch Nails and have been for some time, I am not a fan boy who will blindly stand up for everything Nine Inch Nails. If that is what you are thinking, youare wrong. I am happy that most of the reviews I read are in favor of the new album because Trent does deserve praise for this. I will continue to enjoy Hesitation Marks more and more and already can't wait for the next album. Hopefully in less than five years again.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Great game for adults to be silly while watching TV. Even better if you have 5 and under children.  It is fun to see what they will do with hair.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|It's not that fun it's a basic game where u pretty much spawn things in. It's not worth the money. It's a time-consuming game.
B00190N4E4|5.0|The movie Gandhi documents the life of Mohandas Gandhi. Actor Ben Kingsley starred as the Hindu non-violent leader.<br /> The movie begins just as Gandhi has a life changing racists exchange on a train in South Africa. As a lawyer, educated in London, Gandhi was not knowledgeable about the segregation in South Africa, and was thrown from the train for sitting in first class. This sparked a fire in the young lawyer. Gandhi decides to fight for the fair treatment of Indians in South Africa. After speeches and several jail sentences, Gandhi was satisfied enough changes made by the South African government to return to his home country and do the same work there.<br /> At the time, India was under British rule. Many people in the country suffered because they could not afford to feed their families. Families could not make a living because they could not sell products they made. Most items were British in origin. The movie chronicled Gandhi's fight to get rule of India back in India's hands. Gandhi marched, spoke, fasted, and was jailed several times. Gandhi was a non-violent man and only spoke of peace and harmony. Gandhi's vision, non cooperation with the government would weaken them. After years, several fights, and lives lost, India was finally set free from British rule. Little did Gandhi realize that the control he wanted for the country would come at a price. Gandhi fought for years to be released from British control, only to have a fight between two groups in his own country. The Muslims and Hindu were not in agreement on which group would have more control of how the country was run. For Gandhi, there was no separation, but the people of India did not agree. This disagreement led to more fighting, looting, and killing between Muslims and Hindus. Gandhi fasted once again to stop the anger; this would be his final fast. Once the country learned of the fast, the country turned its attention to the health of the leader. After the people agreed to stop the fighting, Gandhi prepared to visit Calcutta to speak to the people. He never made it. Gandhi was killed that day.<br /> Gandhi was a proud and peaceful Hindu. The movie focused on a hard time in the history of Hindus and Muslims. Gandhi showed the peaceful side of the Hindu religion, but an angrier side of the religion was also depicted in the film. The film, Gandhi, showed how one country could be divided by religion. Religious division was the source of the tension that led to Gandhi's death.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I have never in my life found a more frustrating game. No way could someone actually figure this out without cheating. I just finished &quot;The Room&quot; before this one and it was fun and captivating and I did not have to look up the answers.
1476734941|5.0|I am giving this &#34;diet&#34; a try, as it really fits my lifestyle very well. I am in outside sales so it is very difficult for me to each lunch unless I go to a fast food place or eat in my car, which isn't the best for me. I like the fasting concept and have been doing it for 2 weeks. Have seen a weight loss of 3.7 pounds so far. The fasting gets easier each week. The research presented in the book is very interesting.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Sorry I gave four stars. It's just because I think computer one is a little better but  dis still awesome .WOO MINECRAFT  POCKET EDITION!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. I play it the most but my husband and kids ( 10 yr old son and 9 yr old daughter) play it all the time!
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Waze is a great app, and an excellent GPS tool. It is as good as the people that use it, since it depends largely on user input for the various road conditions.  If my cell service were better I could probably get excited enough to just about give it a five-star rating.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I am changing the rating to 5 STARS, why?  Because I purchased a Galaxy Tab 3 and it works awesome.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Outstanding!!!!!  Excellent!!  Could not put this book down!! This would make a great movie. I've recommended to all my friends!!!

B0002NRRAG|5.0|This disc makes for FANTASTIC dinner music. She mostly sings in English. A little bit in French. Either way, she has such a wonderful &#34;old&#34; sound to her, you will feel yourself immersed in a time period that is likely not your own. Put this disc on and you will feel transcendent.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I think a game like this would be fun for any age. It's so fun. I love that you can change the hair color. It's also fun for children ,teens and adults.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game for people and kids of all ages. enjoyable and always look forward to playing after work or in the mornings!
B00932AA5G|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who asked that American producers leave this one alone.  Americans have a difficult time capturing the sly, subtle nuances that keep this film moving like a jaguar in the night.  I say this and I'm American and love American films.<br />I've watched this three times and each time I catch some new slight detail that further deepens the intrigue.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I shopped a long time before finding this solution to getting great sound on my videos. First, I tried some  poor quality $6.00 jobs. Not surprisingly, they arrived with clips that were broken. What good is a lapel mic that doesn't clip? Then I considered some really expensive options worth over $200. GULP! Thought I'd give these Audio-Technica ATR-3350 a try. My son, who is in the sound tech industry, likes this brand. The sound was crisp and clear. Makes my video commercials sound professional. Very pleased with the quality and price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have learned more things useful about life in this novel than i have learned in my life itself.

B0058UXHHK|2.0|this book was hard to get through at times. i was surprised at how limited and redundant the characters' dialogue was. i had hoped for light-hearted sillyness and fabulous writing (special thanks to the overwhelming outpour of praise in the user reviews). instead i found myself cringing with every labored exchange between the book's heroine and her leading man. crappydoodles indeed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool,when I first started playing it I didn't know what I was getting my self into. It soon became so addictive. I love playing in the different scenes from around he world
B008469DGY|4.0|Flick golf is the best as it is easiest to use.....and quickly becomes addictive.  I have several other golf apps including the Tiger Woods PGA Tour.  The Wood app is so intense and complicated I spend more time trying to get through all the hoops than really playing golf.  Flick Golf gets you on the course and playing and then allows you to progress to other courses based on your performance.  A really good app!!

0307716988|5.0|This book was a great insight into the early days of Michael Jackson. This one was written by him instead of just about him so it was great! A must read for any MJ fan
0307730697|5.0|In Fearless, Eric Elehm has written a collective biography outlining the details of Navy SEAL SIX team member, Adam Brown. Adam Brown grew up in Hot Springs, Arkansas and he was always the wild one and displayed tremendous fearlessness. One time in high school, he even jumped from a moving vehicle going thirty miles per hour over the side of a bridge into the water. He survived and loved the experience. He also had a few other all-pervading action moments in his youth and I think you will see why he always had courage and strength.<br /><br />In his youth, Adam Brown struggled with a drug addict and stole from his loving family. His girlfriend at the time introduced Adam into drugs and they both depended on each other and bonded over drugs. He began to hang out with the wrong crowd and eventually wound up getting arrested a few times. One time when he was arrested, his parents reached out to a local pastor and the pastor agreed to meet with him. His pastor suggested that Adam needed to attend Teen Challenge and the judge allowed it. He was required to attend for a full year and if he left, he would be arrested for the reminder for his sentence. This program taught him a great deal about the Christian faith and the prodigal son in scripture and Adam connected with the story enormously.<br /><br />He turned his life around and finally met his wife, Kelley. He also struggled some relapses throughout the book. Meeting his wife lead him to, realizing his exact passion was to train to be a SEAL and most of the book clarifies the difficult training procedures that they put SEAL team members through. Only a very few people can rise to the challenge and make the team. He ultimately became a SEAL SIX team member and was unfortunately killed in combat. The book will guide readers through the courage and compassion that Adam Brown's life publicly and privately demonstrated.<br /><br />I will admit that I cried during reading this book and it's a problematic one to read because it is very touching and emotional. Adam Brown left behind a lasting legacy that their two children will be proud of their father. I immeasurably enjoyed the poignant stories about Adam connecting with his children and being an active father when he was home. He would take each children individually out for a fun activity with their daddy and he would also have a date night with his wife. This showed how much he loved and cared about having a relationship with his family. He also wrote notes down for his children where they read about his journey as a SEAL member when they got older. One of the most amazing stories was about how he saw little children in Afghanistan having no shoes or socks and it was nearing winter. He thought about his own children and he felt called to ask his family, friends, and church for assistance and they passionately donated shoes and his team risked their lives in delivering the shoes. He also completed his bachelor degree and was planning to apply to Harvard went he was done serving. He knew the trials that he already has overcame in his life and he wanted to succeed in Harvard. Another life changing story was when Adam and his friend, Kevin helped a young boy buy cleats, athletic glasses, and pads. They both agreed that someday they would search out for that boy who was poor but was needing support and new football gear and purchase that kid new gear. This book spoke volumes of the type of character Adam was.<br /><br />I would recommend this excellence book to every adult who enjoys reading Military books and books filled with stories about strength and courage. Just as a side noted this book does include some cuss words but it isn't that bad. Overall, I liked the aspects of Christianity being displayed throughout the book and the raw truth of how Adam's past defined him for many years and his awesome turn around that God was able to perform in his life. I loved the stories that people who knew Adam Brown shared with Eric Blehm in the writing of this incredible book. I learned so much about the intense training and missions that SEAL members have to go through to protect our country. Anyone serving our country is truly a brave hero and I appreciated their sacrifice and dedication to their cause and mission! If you're looking for a stirring book filled with stories of audacity, then please read this book!<br /><br />\\"I received this copy of Fearless for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review\\".riting of this incredible book.

B00F35BV64|3.0|Part of the appeal of the first Star Trek reboot by JJ Abrams was the novelty and newness of the crew when they were younger. It was fresh and added to the the pizzazz of the movie...Now, that has worn off and it's down the story and fx. On both counts, neither are as compelling or exciting as the first rebooted movie. Not terribly bad, just not as exciting. It nearly felt like a made for tv movie, which is what I expected the first to be since Abrams is a TV guy, luckily the first one was as exciting and interesting and action packed as you could want. This one, far less so...felt like Abrams slid back to his TV dramas shtick.
B000E41MS6|5.0|it got here a little late but everything is in great condition! the only problem was that i had to change my computers region to watch it :/ but thats okay :) they worked great!
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I probably would have bought this game if I had known that it wasn't a free game upfront instead of being advertised as free.  After playing for a very brief time a message pops up informing you that the full game will be x amount of dollars.  I love this companies graphics but i won't buy from them any more it this is the trend they are going to.  I downloaded 3 of their games at the same time and found out that all three are like this.  Very disappointed.
1594744769|5.0|Awesome book and I highly recommend it.  It really held my interest and I love Ransom Riggs writing style by making you feel like you are there with the characters.
B00DC8O6T8|3.0|I bought the &#34;whole album&#34; b/c I liked two &#34;hit tracks&#34; I've heard.  I was disappointed with the other tracks.  It's okay, but don't expect the quality of the tracks that probably brought you this band.  The insipid lyrics are my biggest distraction....&#34;lazy lies&#34;?  lazy lyrics!
B00CX7OW1G|5.0|what's this ? an intellectual chick flick ? a power point presentation ? an homage to the silent era ? a collection of classical music videos ? a cleverly devised love mystery to be solved by the viewer by watching multiple times ? some sort of ballet audition ? a joint mont st michel and oklahoma tourist board advert ? a ben affleck maypole movie ? a documentary from no one's perspective ? a church movie ? a terrence malick film ?
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have listened to the CD several times and I like it a lot, many of the songs are good.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Loved this movie and this movie convinced me that I should learn to ballroom dance.  Love the Rumba scene with Fran.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A friend of mine gave me this book to read last year, and I fell in love with it! I decided I had to get it for myself and read it again.
B00CFYD682|4.0|Alison Moyet's latest cd is magnificent! She has a stellar voice and I really appreciate her getting back to her pop-lightness of her early days! Thank you Alison for a great album!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My family liked this one better then the first one. We can't wait until we get the rest of the game. We had no problems with it at all. I would recommend this game to any angry or star wars fan.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|THE SURFERS--fun and exciting to play,lots of activity to keep u interested.will reccomment it to others.they will like it alot
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Silver Linings Playbook is a nicely written movie that doesn't gloss over the conflicts of mental illness within families.  Nor does it &#34;dumb down&#34; the characters who suffer the afflictions.  There was a sincere honesty depicted in the family dynamics, and a genuine awareness by the two main characters of their own problems and how it impacts everyone around them.  This simple story (boy meets girl) is layered with complex interactions and intelligent scripting.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|This product was disappointing. Neither my granddaughter, nor myself, could erase the slate and start a new spin. No instructions, and no idea how to change the size of the brush or the shape of the spin object. I will probably delete it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Old-school ST fan, but I enjoy the new spins. Solid show from everyone, good script and casting. Not a heavy or meaningful work of art, just good fun.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found it a interesting read that was not to predictable. I almost wish there was a squeal. The story followed 3 different lives that were all intertwined. We learn the grass is not always greener.
B009ZQFSRA|1.0|Did not like the plot. No real suspense. Just was not a good movie.Just did not like it at all.
B005HSL626|4.0|My four year old brother loves this game. I swear sometimes i have to pry the tablet from his hand. Good adults and wonderful for kids.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app really helped me I needed just one budder to go to the neather I couldn't find<br />any until I got this app
B00338QENI|4.0|As someone interested in people and science, especially cellular biology, I found this to be a great read. Wonderful biographical piece blended with scientific history.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|Did not like the plot. No real suspense. Just was not a good movie.Just did not like it at all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE IT!!  this game is really addictive, i have to force myself sometimes to put the tablet down. It is AMAZING
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good game for those who enjoy solving puzzles. Can be a little tricky at times but tests abilities to be persistent.Will await the additional levels with baited breath!
0060730552|5.0|I'm a mountaineer (have been in the American Alpine Club Journal for a first ascent of a 3 pitch mixed rock and ice climb on Mt Hood), and this book is my favorite out of all the many, many &#34;armchair mountaineering&#34; books I've read. It is written so vividly that it's more like watching a movie than the movie itself was!
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Gentlemen/Ladies:<br />To who ever review this preview and the previous review. Please try to look at my review from my prospective. How in the world can you expect me to review a video, I have not received in order to provide a proper review. I ordered the video on 20 September 2013 and as of this date I have not been advised of a shipping date. I previously stated &#34;I Hate It&#34; and you did not concur with that. So lets' try &#34;I Don't Like It&#34;. Basically for the same reason, I can not write a review on a Video, I have not received, let alone &#34;viewed&#34;.<br /><br />PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN I CAN EXPECT THE VIDEO TO BE SHIPPED.<br /><br />JOHN B.

B00821OX98|5.0|Wonderful show and great original plot. I wish I could find more show like this. The actors form better chemistry as the show goes on.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I is a fun and challenging puzzle game, but it only took me about an hour to solve all 10 available levels.  Not worth the time of the download yet.  Needs about 290 more levels.  Keep the challenges coming.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I've been looking for a video player that would play all the formats I have in my video library. So far it's played .avi .mp4 .mkv with no problem. I did have to download a codec but it was free, so no biggie. It even has a playlist feature so I made a playlist for my kids' videos so all their videos are easy to access. LOVE it!
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|It's the Black Keys... what more can you say. Slowly amassing their entire collection. Should be there soon. Simply AWESOME!
B002RI90WM|5.0|I loved the book, having had retrievers and Labradors I am sure they could talk! Anyone who is a dog lover will enjoy this.
B003097B64|5.0|Lowell George created Little Feat after being with Zappa for awhile.  It has that New Orleans sound with a frenetic/laid back sound.  Unique and not bar band stuff.  Sometimes it's like being in a basketball on a slow dribble.
B008Q00MRC|5.0|If you like good acting,original story,very good special effects, also if love reading its subtitled. Troll hunter is worth the watch and read
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Thank goodness one could read just one chapter at a time because each one was a wonderful read all by itself.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a lovely, sad, and uplifting book that is also often very funny. The characters and their experiences are very moving.
B004GYY714|5.0|i rate 5 stars because I do not find any fault in it. it is quick and easy to do, simply go in search and put in the name of the station you are looking for. Try it and download you would not regret it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I love all the movies in the Ice Age collection! Granny, the character voiced by Wanda Sykes seals the show! Although not my favorite (which was Dawn of the Dinosaurs), this is a rollicking fun adventure that introduces entertaining new characters. Another great family movie!
B0058YPILY|5.0|i think this is the best show on the tube.  each season gets better and better.  i don't know how they do it. the cast of this series all have issues and it comes out in the series, this usually starts in the back round of a show and several episodes later , that espodies reveals all the ghosts in the closet.  i would recommend this to anyone, greatest series since hill street blues.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|This movie is so cute and I think it is definitely fun for everyone in the family.<br />Lots of action and adventure mixed with fantastic animation for the kids.<br />So many laughs for the adults!<br />Be forewarned though, the ending pulled on my heart-strings a little and I choked back a tear or two.<br />Of course it has what I call a \\"Disney-Ending\\". Everything works out great for everyone!<br />People of all ages will love this movie, I guarantee it!<br />Love that the story is by John Cleese. That should tell you how fun it is!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was a very enjoyable movie.  I love Star Trek movies and this revived series is done quite well.  Excellent story, action and special effects.  Very good movie!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My Celtic ancestry helped me fall in love with this movie! Merida is a positive role model for all little girls! Watching the misadventures of her little brothers, even when in the background, kept me in stitches! A great story of family love and pride will make you laugh, and sometimes cry, and keep you entertained. Another one i love to watch over and over again!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|criminal minds what can you say, this is the best series since hill street blues.  i am hooked on this series, i don't know where these writers come with all this materiel, but its great.  they also havce different directors every week, and that also shows because they don't get into a rut with the episodes.  you have to watch these in order or you wouldn't understand what's going on in the series becasue of what happen before.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It does what I want to be able to do on Facebook! The app keeps me connected with friends and family.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Lots of action.  Good movie to escape from it all, the special effects were really good and the actors were as well.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Breathtaking color! Great music! Adventure, fun, friends, travel... all add up to a very entertaining story! Will definitely watch again!
B009LDD54K|5.0|this is a good series to get hooked on, steve buscemi runs atlantic city new jersey in the the 20's. last season they killed off half the people in the series. so they had to come up will some new people, and bye the end of this series they kill off some more of the cast, you never know who going to be next. i enjoy the series, they have some good writers, waiting for next years dvd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So far the reading is great, I have not finish reading the book but it was highly recommended by a lot of people.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|Classic. Best tos movie in the series. The HD quality makes it even better.  Too bad shatner couldn't be in the new one.
B004Z98B1M|5.0|One of my favorite Disney/Pixar movies. A little boy and a grumpy old man share adventure to fulfill their dreams.Using an unconventional means of travel, they see the world and meet funny animals who help and entertain them. Definitely a film for the whole family!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|If you want to view your Youtube, Netflix or Google Play Services on the TV, this seems to do a good job and was easy to setup.  I was able to play Youtube 1080p videos from my tablet app or from their web site on my laptop's Chrome browser and the streaming quality was good.  Chromecast power from USB port on TV is convenient.  For other websites however, it can only send Chrome tab content from a desktop or laptop. In this case, streaming from my laptop stalled often to the point it was not watchable.  Tablet versions of the Chrome browser are not compatible with Chromecast.  I decided to return it due to its limited capabilities.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I could watch this over and over.  Love the whole idea of the music and the talent of whoever was playing the instruments. Just Amazing
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|As soon as I downloaded this to my phone I started getting pop-up ads. I uninstalled it and can not figure out how to get rid of these pop-ups and I'm so mad about it! Thanks Adobe!!
B0041KXUGQ|5.0|No matter how many times I watch this movie, I want to watch it again and again! I can get lost in the amazing technology, the fantastic beings on other worlds, the characters with and without morals or integrity, spectacular scenery, and breathtaking adventures! Definitely fuels my imagination!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Good book in a good series.  This guy knows how to throw things in you don't expect and leave you hanging.  I can hardly wait for the next one.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|The book kept my interest throughout. I enjoyed all the characters. But the end was too quick. I expected a little more
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Highly recommend this book!  Faith in action...especially when put to the test.  You can't NOT be changed by this book!  Don't miss it!
B003BWERF8|5.0|Works great!  Using it with my classic IPOD. Synching it up with a small Bose rechargeable speaker and have had no problems at all.  Perfect!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I could see myself in so many of Sheryl's scenario's, she made me more comfortable with how I deal with work issues. I have been out work for over two years and after reading this book I feel more empowered to &#34;Lean In&#34;, to take charge of my life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Bought this for a long car ride & could not put it down.  Great story & I loved the Australian slant.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|expected to be at least at a TV stick level... too bad it only can be controlled from another device (PC, tablet or  phone)...
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Inspirational story of old love rekindled by a 21st century camino. The narrative interweaves the quietly tragic story of a quintessential english couple with beautifully evoked images of the english countryside and miniature cameos of modern Britain.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I have this displayed on a table next to my bed....have'nt got lucky since  :( all kiddin aside, a great compliment to the last seasons sp.edition blu-ray set
B005GRTNVE|5.0|THEY NEVER SEEM TO DISAPPOINT.  THERE ARE NO BAD PERFORMANCES.<br /><br />  SOME ARE JUST ALITTLE BETTER THAN OTHERS.  LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR NEXT RELEASE
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app works as advertised and looks beautiful. I Love the live background and the easy to read layout. Definitely worth the money.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|fast delivery well put togather set that met all expectations exc price too big indiana fan recommended to any movie buff
B00471TLZS|5.0|Always comes up in the top ten ghost movies ever made....no wonder!! The top of the list of ghost movies to watch each Halloween.
B00336C3EY|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but it dragged a bit.  I also felt like I was left hanging with the ending.  I'm all for a story letting me decide how it ends but I like to have a choice between a couple of very strong options.  I didn't feel that this movie provided those options so I only gave it three stars.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  The acting is great, the premise is fun and the twists and turns aren't perceptible until they happen.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is a great product for machinima and 3D animation manipulation! I recommend it to drafters, 3d modelers and animators.
B0053FANS6|5.0|Of all the mummy movies ever made these are the best....The first two were something to enjoy over and over again..
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|It was good but no match when it comes to The Walking Dead, Zombies move to fast but over all I would see it again..
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great, great, great. This show is one of few that never gets old. The writers continually add new concepts, villains, devices, problems it a very inticing upward spiral. Wish it had never ended. Maybe a new story line can be established with the Goa'uld attempting to attack Earth again.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|OK game, but it's only good on one device.  We must pay a buck for each phone. I have many.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|After this came out we were exposed to other great dinosaur films and documentaries.....who could ever forget the first time we sat and watch &#34;walking with dinosaurs&#34;...and it all came about as a result of the inovative technology used in these films..Not to mention the thrill factor of these particular movies.
B00ECJ18HO|5.0|This was my first kindle book with pictures, beautiful! Never read the story before,loved it and will return to it many times!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I bought this series to help me pass the time during the summer, but I did not expect it to consume my time. The story was riveting from beginning to end and the third person point of view which shifts between characters gives you incredible insight into those character's mind sets and their motivations. You never quite know what's going to happen next and George is always going to surprise you by killing off someone whom you thought to be an important and central character. I would recommend this series for anyone who enjoys mysteries, medieval works, adventure, or political intrigues. Overall, it was phenomenal and I can't wait till the next book in the series is published just so I can see what happens next.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have been a fan of these books since Christmas of 1996 when I got the first one for a gift.  I have now bought these books a total of 6 times, as sometimes when they get lent out they don't come back before I want to read them again.  Now, I never have to buy them again!  The Song of Ice and Fire series is probably the best modern fantasy series around.  The time and effort put into each and every word, has made this epic stretch for almost 20 years and still not be a completed work.  I know the wait for the final books will be worth it, as I do enjoy the quality of the end result.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|One of the best witchcraft movies in quite a while,the story was good the special effects were not corny,I actually rented it first and loved it so much I went and bought the blu-ray
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This is not a bad movie.  It was entertaining and fun to watch!  It's a Zombie movie and definitely one of the better ones and I say this not really being a Brad Pitt fan.  I'll watch again and recommend.
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|This is the only mirror that my wife and I have found that will work well on drop down handle bars. We have touring bikes with front brake/shifters and a second set of upper brakes so location is a challenge for other mirrors. They work awesome, easily move out of the way when needed and can be removed quickly. I highly recommend them for anyone who doesn't want a mirror on the side of their helmet.
B003L77G38|5.0|What more can I say?  You need to watch it in order....  and again and again and again.  Great show, I love all the hidden messages in the background of almost every scene.  I love the glyph code.  I will enjoy this for a long time to come.  It is great fun.  Right up there with Ron Moore's BSG and Breaking Bad.
B00CTT9646|5.0|When I read the description I thought&#34;yea,it's probably  a cheesy cheap poc&#34;,on the contrary,this is cool and when displayed looks like art.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I was hoping this would be good but it was only okay.  I loved the kids and the &#34;Mark Twainish&#34; feel to the movie, but every time Matthew McConaughey came on the screen I thought &#34;Oh look there's Matthew McConaughey&#34;.  I didn't connect to his character only saw the movie star....
B000000Y2R|5.0|Be sure to get the 2013 remaster of this concert classic, not the earlier version shown at this site.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|See my review of the 4 book set for more detail. This was a perfect continuation of the story.  This series can come off as being one very long book written all at once to the unaware. I know and have met a number of people that started to read these because of the HBO series and thought it was made all at once without an end on purpose.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Alex, the main character, is a loathsome killer, but in the end, I was rooting for justice on her behalf.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this masterpiece when it came out in 2000. I was moved beyond tears. I invited my sister to see it a week later. She loved it and was moved as I was, exactly in the same way, but forbade me from bringing her to anything like it again. It 's devastating beauty was just too much! We couldn't speak of it without losing composure.<br /><br />The scene where the gramma phone speaker is turned to the window is so sublime and beautiful.<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone, but see it anyway.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Great game all around but........played for quite awhile, then for some reason it froze during gameplay and never opened again. It wont complete loading screen! I'm highly disappointed because I played for hours and my character was beefy and I cant even play! I was almost level 30! Frustrated and disappointed ......sorry UNINSTALL!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Even though I'm seen all episodes, I watch them over and over.Can't wait for the next season to become available.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but I found it to be slightly too technical in medical terminology.  It became difficult to follow with so very many technical medical terms. It would have held my interest more if it had been expressed in layman's terms. The premise is a good one, and I understand the difficulties the author faces in distinguishing scientific fact versus spirituality. An interesting story and one that should be shared.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Take the time to free yourself.  Take the time to love yourself.  Take the time to change the world, starting with your reality.
B004S49YEM|4.0|Good read.<br />It was a bit predictable towards the end.<br />I would still recommend the book to others as a light entertainment.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|One of the best books by a Near Death experiences. Heard the author's excellent talk at the 2013 IANDS conference in Arlington, Va.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Loved the perspective having read the Woodville view points first. Reading these several books really gives a feel for the era and how unstable and unsafe it was for anyone near succession to the crown. Wonder why no one said &#34;no thanks&#34;!
B003G4W49C|3.0|If you like Sci Fi, you will like this book.  I was reading it as a choice for a student but the language and innuendos were too high.  It just didn't fit my needs and I am not a SciFi fan.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|Could not put it down, however I had to, to see the sights of New York and recharge the batteries.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is a very easy read and has great concepts. Even if real estate is not right for you this book will get you going in the right direction to understanding finances.
B00A285OOW|5.0|If you love Philippa Gregory, you will continue to be totally entertained and informed by her work. I highly recommend.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Worst movie you will ever lay eyes on.....the &#34;Z&#34; is for zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br />Pitt is horrible and must have been hard up for a paycheck....AVOID!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I tend to use my kindle fire for a fair amount of stuff that is outside the Amazon ecoverse - that tends to consume memory and litter up the joint. This app seems to do nice job of sweeping everything up - it even just warned me while I was doing some reading that I might want to do a cleanup - handy
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Rachel Joyce has constructed a little jewel of a story, told with a light but firm rendition, which brings with it a special charm. It tells of survival, and the importance of respect and understanding, and of determination to follow one's gut instincts. It is a little story, about ordinary people, but it brings with it special insights about life and happiness, which stay with the reader, and which demand ongoing attention.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent step-by-step instruction manual, designed to prove everything DOES happen for a reason.  Still reading, but already have received specific validations.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the character development of the women- I was quick to turn the pages all the way to the end wanting to know what will happen. Very good!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie gives a historical picture of the discrimination that was prevalent in Mississippi at the time, buit wraps it in a great and humorous story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I bought the game because I was bored. It was a good decision! The kids I baby sit adore it!
B008JFUNYG|1.0|I know Tyler Perry films have been declining in quality but, boy, Evil Dead is rock bottom. I think Madea only appears like once and most of the jokes fall flat. The only up side was that the make up was so good that I could only way I tell that Perry was playing the lead female character due to the bad acting.<br /><br /> The credits were also well done.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I am a recent Castle fan and was now able to see all of the first season to lay the ground work for getting caught up through season 5.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Bruce Willis is just fun to watch.  His action films are well made.  This film keeps you interested to the very end.  Thumbs up.
B002HXR542|5.0|Okay.  I'm not sure I am qualified to leave a review considering I had to turn it off in the last 20 minutes.  But It was hands down the scariest 4/5 of a movie I have ever seen except maybe for the Exorcist.  It's kind of a zombie movie I guess, although these \\"zombies\\" make the film 28 Days Later look like RomCom and The Walking Dead series look like a YouTube montage of fuzzy kittens playing with yarn.  The camera work is a little annoying, but I understand the whole idea of 'lost footage' type films.  The one unrealistic thing about this is if I were the news team, I would have ditched the camera and barricaded myself in an apartment about 10 minutes into the ordeal. Screw the public's right to receive fair and accurate coverage of the situation.  Self preservation is an instinct I take very seriously.  But other than that...  This movie is scary, intense, well made, has great acting, and a great script.  Don't watch if you have heart problems, cry easily or have problems with bedwetting.<br /><br />I FORGOT TO ADD -- Find it online in subtitles instead of the dubbed version here.  The dubbing was distracting and comical at times.  I switched almost immediately and found it on YouTube in English subtitles.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Well, I am a Rusher, so there was no one this could have disappointed me. If you like Big Time Rush's other songs, you will enjoy this album.
B0006LZPLC|5.0|These were replacements for my old keens of the same model which I have worn quite a lot for about 9 years.  I look forward to another 9 years of great performance from these sandals as well.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|best tv show that has been on for a long time, i wouldn't miss one episode! the characters are in depth and the story is captivating
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I did not have an opportunity to see this free preview. Isn't that always the case. I didn't even know I was getting a free &#34;instant video&#34; of the movie when I bought it. imagined how surprised I was when I learned I had missed out on the window of opportunity to view it. I was almost sad. But alas. (I've always wanted to say that! ).<br />It's gotta be a good movie though, the toys were great when I was a kid... in the 60s. And isn't the movie based on the toy ¿

B00190N4E4|5.0|Gandhi is a biographical film that tells the story of the life of Mohandas Gandi. He was the leader of India's non-violent and non-cooperative independence movement against the UK's rule. This movie was written by John Briley and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough. The film covers a major moment in Gandhi's life where he was thrown off a South African train for being in a compartment that was only for white people in 1893. It covers his life up until his assassination in 1948. The end of his life was actually portrayed at the beginning and throughout the movie it flashed back into earlier points in his life. After the South African incident he realizes that laws were biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent campaign for their rights. It took some time and many arrests and attention from other people but eventually the government started recognizing rights for them. Because of this, when Gandhi returns to India, he is seen as a hero. After World War II, the UK granted India its independence but religions problems began between the Hindus and the Muslims nation-wide. It was constant fighting and violence.  Gandhi then says he is going on a hunger strike until the fighting stops. The fighting eventually stops but the country is divided by religion. He spends his last days trying to bring peace between them both.<br />This relates to world religions because even though Gandhi was a practicing Hindu, he embraced Christianity and Islam a lot. He did not say his beliefs were above all else and condemn others. Instead he tried to bring peace between everybody. This movie covers Hinduism as well as Islam since there was a big up rise between Hindus and Muslims. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend any and everyone to watch it. Watching this movie is a good reminder that coexistence is something I stand strongly for. It is a huge eye opener.
B000OLRH10|4.0|What a great movie with terrific actors.  It never gets old. The topic discussed in the movie &#34;blood diamonds&#34; is a real occurrence in time and worth watching to get an insight on what it is going on in the world.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I really like this book!When i was in second grade I read the book so this was my second time reading that book and I thought that it is very th interesting!I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series!I think that it was a four and an half stars
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It's a cute story and good to see strong female roles.  However, I never appreciate stories that make men look foolish in contrast to the strong women.  Women can be strong and exceptional along side strong and exceptional men.  For that reason, I don't think this is a good story to model gender roles for boys or girls.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I wish he made another book cause it was so good. I could not put it down LOVED IT SO MUCH
B00EI6E17A|5.0|She's still got it, great beat and the video is awesome also. I look forward to the cd coming out.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|The strength of this book and what I found to be the most interesting was the relationships that was built all through the book. The relationships and characters and their emotions and actions felt natural and realistic. It was also interesting to observe the 50s' and 60's through a modern eye.<br /><br />The backdrop with saving Kennedy and everything around that wasn't as fun to be and was kind of meh and made the book too long. But good writing, good characters, and an interesting story all in all so it deserved a 4 star nonetheless.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have been searching for an app that helps me monitor what my grandchildren are doing on my Kindle.  The reason being, the other day I picked up my Kindle for the first time in days and found some disturbing content on my bookmarks.  Although my grandchildren are young and the content was most certainly an accidental find, I was mortified.  I pray that the images were something that will not damage their innocence due to their young age.<br /><br />When I downloaded Kids Place - Parental Control (FREE) It allowed me to put only the bookmarks that the children are allowed to view.  Their screen pops up as soon as the device is turned on.  In order to access the rest of my bookmarks requires me to put in a numeric password.  I now have peace of mind.<br /><br />I never dreamed my Kindle would be a hazard to my grandchildren.  I am so thankful to have the tools to prohibit any unsavory content in the future.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Interesting and horrible. I've heard about this story on the news when she got found, and it was interesting to read her story with her own words. It's hard to imagine, spending 18 years in captivation. So many years wasted, not to do what you want with.<br /><br />The book is not too long, which I found good. It doesn't need to be any longer. Her narrating voice really seemed to fit the psychophysical state of her, it seemed a bit childish but not in a bad way. It made it all more real. It's was also fascinating to read how the mind copes with situations like this, the survival instinct.
0525953728|5.0|I highly recommend this book as a reminder of the sacrifices and bravery of our soldiers.  Welcome home, brave men and women who continue to fight for freedom, democracy and human rights.
0385743564|5.0|Imagine a future Earth where humans suddenly become superhuman, Epics, as the ordinary humans call them.  What would real humans do if handed extraordinary powers?  Sadly, they don't seem to become selfless X-Men. Instead, greed, crime and power grabs abound, with ordinary humans crushed like ants in the chaos, as the most powerful Epics set themselves up as crime bosses running whole cities, with humans as little more than slaves and toys they break and discard at will.<br /><br />The hero of this story, David, watches his father die at the hands of one such mutant, Steelheart, after his dad somehow miraculously injures the supposedly invincible man. Steelheart goes into a frenzy, obliterating all who witnessed his moment of weakness, but young David survives.  He spends the next decade of his life hiding and plotting revenge.<br /><br />He maneuvers himself into a recruit position with the mysterious Reckoners- a group of ordinary humans dedicated to guerrilla warfare against their mutant overlords.  He quickly drags them into his plot to finally kill Steelheart--for he believes he knows Steelheart's only weakness.<br /><br />I loved the twists and turns of the plot as this riveting story winds to its final conclusion, leaving just enough loose ends to hint at a second book to come.  The take on mutants, while it's been done before, is handled with Sanderson's exquisite skill at creating detailed worlds and characters. And though I do believe this book is aimed at young adults, it will keep readers of any age engaged and on the edge of their seats.  I loved this story, and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked this book. I didn't love it, but I enjoyed reading it. It's a beach read and not something I will likely remember.
B003IQ169W|4.0|Hm.<br /><br />This book took me through many stages of star-rating. It first begun with me thinking it a two star, then upgraded a bit to a three star and eventually landed me with the feeling it was worth four stars.<br /><br />It's a well written tale of how a girl grows into a woman. It has interesting observations of cultural clashes, poetic wisdom and thoughts about life. The characters feels humane and real and the love relationship feels very realistic with it's emotions and pace.<br /><br />I would recommend it.

031623480X|4.0|\\"Grain Brain,\\" by David Perlmutter, M.D., is the latest book to link a high carbohydrate diet to serious health concerns.  The content of Perlmutter's thesis is fairly consistent with that of another recent offering, \\"The Great Cholesterol Myth: Why Lowering Your Cholesterol Won't Prevent Heart Disease--and the Statin-Free Plan That Will,\\" by Jonny Bowden and Stephen Sinatra, M.D., except that Perlmutter's book points to illnesses of the brain such as Alzheimer's rather than of the heart.<br /><br />Perlmutter's premise is that carbohydrates, not fats, and in particular gluten and sugar, cause various health issues that lead to mental health problems like dementia.  He advocates a diet that eschews even whole grain foods and some high sugar fruits, but which embraces grass-fed meat, wild fish, eggs, butter, dark chocolate, nuts, wine, and green (preferably raw) vegetables.  He promotes aerobic exercise, seven hours of sleep, and the use of supplements like alpha-lipoic acid, coconut oil, DHA, probiotics, resveratrol, turmeric, and vitamin D.<br /><br />\\"Grain Brain\\" outlines a four-week regimen to get the body accustomed to the requirements of Perlmutter's program.  Perlmutter believes that fasting is a healthy part of one's routine, and advocates one at the start of the program and periodically thereafter.  A daily schedule is proposed, along with a recommended menu for a week.  In addition, the book provides over three dozen recipes using foods extolled by the author.<br /><br />Like \\"The Great Cholesterol Myth,\\" this book upsets conventional wisdom on proper diet, and for this reason may be confusing to the ordinary reader.  Although Perlmutter's argument often seems convincing, the evidence provided is sometimes less than solid.  To supplement accounts of relevant medical studies whose conclusions contain conditional words like \\"may\\" or \\"possibly,\\" Perlmutter presents anecdotal information.  These are often compelling accounts, but nonetheless there is the nagging sense that all has not yet been said on the subject--that our bodies and brains are, in fact, much more complicated than what this book suggests.<br /><br />One of the biggest bugaboos of \\"Grain Brain\\" is gluten.  There is no doubt that gluten sensitivity  is a problem with some people, particularly those with celiac disease, but it's by no means clear that it is an issue for everyone.  The argument that early humans did not cultivate grains and that the modern human genome is still one unaccustomed to processing gluten--a line of reasoning akin to that of paleo diet proponents--seems dubious.  Nonetheless, that many people feel better after being on a gluten-free diet is worthy of more study.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Grain Brain\\" is highly readable as well as provocative.  If Perlmutter's thesis isn't impervious to criticism, it nonetheless deserves fair appraisal by open minds.  Meanwhile, the general prescriptions are wise and non-controversial: eat more veggies, eat less in general, get more exercise, and rest more.  Just don't have your cake and eat it, too.ng sense that all has not yet been said on the subject--that our bodies and brains are, in fact, much more complicated than what this book suggests.<br /><br />One of the biggest bugaboos of \\"Grain Brain\\" is gluten.

B0081HLM2E|5.0|The DVD arrived in excellent condition and on time.  Better than that it is an excellent film.  The story is captivating about the most successful placement executive in Norway who supports his life style as an art thief.  That must have been an interesting story conference before the film was green lighted.  The hero becomes the object of a killer's search under bizarre and believable circumstances.  You are grabbed and rocketed with this guy.

B0023RSZLY|5.0|Many non-fiction books can be tough to read, especially ones where chronological events have such an important place in the total story.  Mr. Halberstam weaves events and personalities in such a wonderful way that you are turning page after page, and when you leave the book, you can't wait to return to it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I began the book with not so high expectations. Not that I thought it would be a bad read, but mostly because I wanted to read the book before starting to watch the series.<br /><br />But wow, did the book capture me! It was far better that I ever had thought. I really loved how rich the world was built, it felt real and well thought. The characters well developed and believable. The characters and the happenings really made me feel; sadness, hope, bitterness, irritation, frustrating, chock. Its seldom I have felt so emotions so strongly true a book.<br /><br />I really liked as well that the book dared to be dark. That the characters were not holy, that bad things could happen and without making up for it.<br /><br />A new favourite.
B009MF56GC|5.0|excellent movie.  I wish i would have seen it when it first released but better late than never.  I am enjoying it.
B007HE8XIS|5.0|Shankar has assembled a wonderful collection of music from Indian and Spanish traditions. The rhythms are fresh, and the music resonates with energy. Truly multi-cultural and engaging. Superb!!!!
B009AJDDQU|2.0|I gave it an extra star because we had fun pretending to be Elvira and making fun of the movie.<br />This movie is crap whether you've seen Alien or not. DH had not, I had, and we both couldn't believe how lame this movie was.<br /><br />Yet another movie that has team members who would *never* pass psych vetting prior to being assigned.<br /><br />The only believable character for me was the captain and the two guys working with him.<br /><br />Problems:<br />someone desperately wanted to ride the coattails of a tremendously well-made movie by making a \\"prequel\\" and failing EPICALLY<br />bad acting, but given the material to work with it's understandable<br />zero character development<br />unbelievably stupid crew members<br />bad editing and it was still over two hours - so many things could have been left out, but
B001NLKXK2|4.0|A griping insight on how it is to live with the Alzheimer's Disease, both from the victim's POV and the surrounding family and friends.<br /><br />It was written well on how Alice's mind and memory slowly started to get more bad, and I liked the characters in the whole. I felt that John, the husband, got a bit demonetized as he had a hard time tackling his wife's disease and how she changed, but also for him wanting to keep having his own life. A hard battle, surely, on how long one should stop his/her own life for someone else.<br /><br />I found the language suiting in his coldness and without really vivid emotions, but sometimes I felt the language were over my head with terms and med-talk that I had no clue about. It might be that English isn't my mother language, but it was a little bit hard at times.<br /><br />On a whole, a good, griping book that I read in two days, with good insight about this disease that I've never considered how it is to have or be around. But I probably won't read it a second time.

B004WR125O|2.0|This is not very powerful. I bought the TX-NR525 and bought this along with that to get my receiver wireless. First I connected my receive, powered it on, waited for it to finish initializing and then plugged it in the read USB port. I wanted to leave the front USB port open, just in case I want to connect something temporary, in the future.  After multiple tries (spending my entire sunday afternoon), I couldn't get it to work. I tried PIN, WPS, changing channels etc. etc, it just wouldn't work. I can see my SSID, right up there in the top of the list, but it is just not able to make the connection.<br /><br />I moved it to the front USB port and tried again. BAM..!! It picked up the signal, and worked in the first try. So used the Net option and tried everything out, great performance, and I was happy about it.<br /><br />Short lived happiness, I guess. I put the receiver off, went on with my other chores and put it on again after an hour. Same problem, I have been trying for the past hour to get it to work again..<br /><br />If I have to fiddle around with it every time I switch it on, it is just not worth it. There is one  more thing I got to try before returning this little piece of @#$%. I am going to use a cable and put this dongle on a cable and attach that cable to the receiver. I hate returning stuff.<br /><br />I will post my update here.. shortly.<br /><br />UPDATE:  IT WORKS..!!!! I found an old USB cable (male to female) lying around, used to connect this small dongle and left the dongle on top of the entertainment center. I am getting 55% signal strength and it varies between 35% to 60%. I have switched it off, switched it on a couple of times and so far seems to work.<br /><br />Please note, I have changed my 1 star rating to a 2 star and kind of mellowed down the title, now that I have it working..!!<br /><br />I guess those who have given it 5 stars or 4 stars are people who have their router next to the dongle or home theater receiver, or at least,in the same room/floor/vicinity.
B004LUS390|2.0|I got this app on sale thinking \\"Autodesk must make a good drawing app\\". I tried it 5 or 6 times now and it continues to frustrate me. I have a good drawing and PC back ground. I use Photoshop, painter and paper too but I find Sketchbook lacking.<br /><br />Specifically... No brush blend mode, very week manual, slow, not precise, and generally not much better than any free drawing app.<br /><br />If you like drawing just look up one of the many free apps.<br /><br />Sketchbook... skip it.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Special effects and very little else. What could be \\"else\\"? Plot, scary, engaging.....this is a very \\"flat\\" movie, meaning you could watch this and read a newspaper at the same time or do your nails or go have a snack and never miss anything of consequences. Thinking of renting or buying? If a special effects or Brad Pitt junky, then ok. Otherwise move on to something else. Date movie?? Slight \\"yes\\". Viewing with spouse? Nah. Guys only? Not really.

B001EJGQTU|1.0|Largely thanks to this guy and LBJ I had three tours in Vietnam.<br />MacNamara was never asked very tough questions.  He should have had to explain the attack on the USS Liberty by Israel.  MacNamara never answered on why we were not allowed to at least try to win in Vietnam.  I would have liked to ask the former SecDef if he knew that LBJ owned companies that made a lot of money of of the war.  I did like the music.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought 'Fifty Shades' was well written from the beginning. I didn't know a lot about it-just that it was controversial. I thought it was from Grey's perspective instead of the woman. It is a good page turner (or in my case) a button pusher. You don't want to put it down because you want to know what's going on next with their relationship-although your ashamed to admit it. I don't think it is going to be a classic novel. For anyone thinking about reading it, just know the sex is kinky and graphic-but  it stayed true to the story because that is the nature of the story line of Christian Grey.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Didn't keep my interest. Had a hard time relating to it. Too science fiction for me. I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|It is a wonderful story first of all. In regard to the acting, it is hard to tell if there is an over acting or they were just playing the Italian humor. Although, the characters were acceptable and transmitted the role.<br />Other than personal perceptions, it is a piece of art and legacy of a horrendous episode of humanity that should not be forgotten.<br />It is a big contrast of how &#34;peaceful&#34; was Italy and how it allowed the couple to meet, but as it happens in reality, things change and the Nazi changed the fate of Europe and this family.<br />Everyone should watch this movie and remember.
0345525558|1.0|Having heard so many people rave about this book, I had high expectations. So I was surprised to find myself slogging through this tedious book about a completely unlikable character.  Every sane person has a few blind spots and moments of self-sabotage, but this character, supposedly sane, was a complete and unrealistic mess. If she had suffered from a brain disorder, her behavior might have made sense. The narrative jerking back an forth between time periods was annoying--especially the obvious expected revelation of some major incident on the horizon. Just spit it out, for crying out loud. And the whole flower business was way overworked.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Used to read all of King's books, but not in recent years. So glad I bought this one. Especially fun to revisit the 50's and 60's. King remains a very talented author, and I enjoyed the book.

B00DCRE7M0|3.0|I liked the beginning of this album a lot but once it's starts getting into the bulk of the album is just loses it for me. It really gets ballady and stale sounding towards the middle of the album, I think I only made it through the whole album once because it just gets so generic sounding to me. I liked the way the album started with lots of energy but it just kind of lost that push that got me into it in the first place.

B0084ANCBC|5.0|Reactions to this novel will probably depends heavily on two things -- tolerance for a long, sprawling, often diffuse story and a willingness to immerse oneself in a book where none of the main characters are fully likable people.<br /><br />This is a long, long book.  When I started reading it I was living in Arizona with no plans to move.  By the time I finished the book this week, I had been a resident of Minnesota for almost three months.  And I'm not a slow reader.  It isn't the most sprawling Victorian novel I've read ([[ASIN:B0082XOBCA The Way of All Flesh]] felt a lot longer and involved many more generations and [[ASIN:B00DMJ7MLG Wives and Daughters: An Everyday Story]], another great serial novel, was also pretty meandering), but it is certainly in the category.<br /><br />If you have a willingness to immerse yourself in an author's world for an extended period of time, you will probably enjoy this novel.  It helps, however, to also have an appetite for harsh social commentary.  It doesn't seem as if the author likes anybody very much.  Even the characters who are initially appealing turn out to have serious character flaws.  Readers who want to \\"like\\" characters should probably keep looking.<br /><br />On the whole, I thought this novel was an excellent read.  The author's wit, while not as sharp as Dickens at his best, is enjoyable.  The frequent authorial injections, while an old-fashioned technique, were delivered with a sensibility that was quite modern.  The story didn't turn out at all as I expected it would.<br /><br />If you have an appetite for a long novel with realistic characters, I highly recommend this book.  I liked it enough to want to check out more of the author's work.  Comparing him to authors like Austen isn't really fair.  He was really working in a completely different way, with the same elements of social satire, but on a much longer scale and in a much darker vein.

B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Not for the faint at heart but keeps you guessing and coming back for more.  It takes you in a world that is dark and keeps you shaking you head saying really???  Not predictable and not your average show.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|My wife loves this movie.  Finally found on blu ray.  A great movie.  This is Travolta at one of his best even though it is not talked about much.
B00DKY4LBW|3.0|As the production of the albums become cleaner, and the energy of the band dampens, it seems as if the band has lost their magic. \\"Why'd you only call me when your high?\\" is a great track, but the album just doesn't capture that same rawness as the earlier albums, even the last one felt stale. I hope they can redeem themselves.
