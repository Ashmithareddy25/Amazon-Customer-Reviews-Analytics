B0000844I8|2.0|Fantastic idea for a movie with completely awful execution. I'm so glad that the makers of SG-1 saw the potential that was there in this franchise. The only reason I bought this was my wife wanted it.    In short, if your wife wants this movie, buy it. Otherwise don't bother unless you really want to see how amazing Stargate SG-1 is compared to its origins.
B0000029GA|5.0|When I first heard this album I couldn't believe my hears. This album is perfect in every way
B000002IRL|5.0|I got introduced to this group once when I was watching Headbangers Ball and the old pirate ships came up in Horroscope-- loved that video.  The other time I got introduced while at hockey school and Booger # 1 and #2 were listening to Overkill.  It was real strange cause there was a bat hiding out in our lounge area that year.  Anyway when I listen to Overkill it reminds me of Fear Factory and the whole idea of the future machine and also a System of a Down song.   I love the riffs to this album and the singing is good.  It is hard pressed to find a group as focused and determined as Overkill.
B000P0J02E|4.0|It's a good movie but hard to follow if you haven't seen the first two.   But the sound track is awesome.
B0011NVCO8|4.0|I'm glad this is getting a high def media release. It will make a nice addition to my HD DVD collection.    The film itself has a very gritty feel to it, much like last years \\"The Departed\\". It's not an overly violent film, but if you like cop dramas then this will satisfy you. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, there does seem to be a feeling that it's missing a little something. Not sure what. Maybe the resolution comes a little quickly after most of the film goes to pains to let you see the true character of these men.     If you are a fan of crime drama, Denzell Washington, or Russell Crowe, this movie won't disappoint you. It's a keeper!
B000E6UWE4|2.0|I am 30 pages from finishing and feel the book was not worth my time.  I liked some of the characters but the lack of development in most of them left me not caring what happened to them.  I feel like I am plodding through a book I have to read more than one I want to read.  very much like the later books of Robert Jordan.  I read a lot of fantasy/sci fi I am afraid to put too much time into something that can turn into the \\"waste of time\\"....sorry I meant the \\"wheel of time\\" by Jordan .
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book and I'm glad I got it so quick after ordering it.  I identified with a lot of her experiences and laughed out loud many times. It was an awesome read! I'm really satisfied with the decision to read this book.
B000Y7U98W|2.0|I just got a new HD tv (Samsung 4771F) and this is far and away the best blu-ray i have watched onit yet. Its almost worth watching this movie just to see how amazing it looks... but thats it!  Im a big fan of sci-fi and this movie was just not well done.  Clearly all the budget was put into special effects and not the script or good actors.
B0011NVC98|5.0|The value of this gloriously rendered visual spectacle is entertainment.  Forget the literary parallels with, or deviations from, a timeless classic epic poem.  Forget religious issues, high moral and philosophical ponderings, forget deep, complex characterizations, subliminal messages and historical realism.  Just sit back and enjoy what the movie, unapologetically and masterfully intends to be, which is pure, first-rate entertainment.  There is no need to go beyond the simple story messages of the value of courage, even when coupled with bombastic lack of humility; Beowulf is many things and lacks many virtues, but the man is brave, period, and makes no apologies for the fact.  The human weaknesses and the price to pay for them, often extending far into the future and beyond the original generation, should be self evident and sufficient, no additional philosophizing need be applied here.  And most viewers agree that the simply awesome visual effects and masterful use of state-of-the-art CGI technology make this film a non-stop feast for the eyes.  Cartoon-like?  Sure.  Accurate?  Of course not.  Politically correct?  Definitely not.  Pure, enjoyable entertainment with great visuals, excellent music score and impeccably cast characters?  Now you get it.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I love the pace of these movies.  I don't know why they haven't turned this into a series as of yet, but I certainly hope they continue making the movies.  It is a wonderful addition to any collection and Tom Selleck plays this character brilliantly.  Check them all out if you get a moment.
0738702994|5.0|I love this Tarot Deck. Got it at a bargain price on amazon as full boxed set with a lovely book (with the full story behind each card and some tarot spreads to try), the cards( great illustrations and a good size for handling) and a lovely gold organza bag. The Welsh Mythological theme to these cards make them great for collectors and mythology buffs, but with there straightforward explanations these are also a great beginners set or working deck. I would recommend these Tarot cards to anyone with the slightest interest in Tarot or Mythology.
061891868X|5.0|This book is a MUST read for anyone who believes in the importance of science as a human endeavour.    I have read many popular books on the subjects of cosmology, particle phycics, quantum mechnanics, String theory, etc.  Along the way I have read countless books that purport to be for the layman; most start strong covering the topics one would expect (wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principal, special relativity, etc.), but then quickly digress into overly technical explanations that lose most laymen.  A great example is Hawking's much-touted [[ASIN:0553380168 A Brief History of Time]] -- I'm convinced that most people who own this book have never read the whole thing.  I know I didn't.    Lee Smolin's book is a rare exception.  Here is a brilliant and articulate scientist capable of describing exceptionally complex ideas in very simple terms.  He understands exactly where his typical reader's limits of knowledge sit, and works carefully withing those limits.  He is also sure to note when he is glossing important details that true practitioners in his field would want to elaborate on.  For this alone, Smolin's book is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the broad issues being explored in today's most advanced physics programs.    More importantly, though, this is a truly COURAGEOUS book.    Smolin states that, while it is a worthwhile endeavour, String theory has unfairly dominated major research programs for too long.  For sociological and political reasons, Smolin argues that String theory has squeezed out healthy scientific debate about the \\"foundational\\" issues surrounding the unification of quantum mechanics and relativity.  Smolin himself is an advocate of quantum gravity, an alternate approach to String theory.  It's important to note that Smolin never claims that Loop Quantum Gravity (his favoured approach) is right; his primary point is that it is an axample of an alternate approach that it is worthy of exploration but that receives littleattention.    What makes Smolin brave is that he tackles his own professional community.  As anyone who has achieved some success in a field will tell you, this takes a lot of guts.  And though he presents all of his arguments without malice, there is little doubt that the String theory establishment would not appreciate the way it is characterized in Smolin's book.  I can only imagine the nasty response that Smolin has received (actually, there are many blogs that attack Smolin mercilessly -- when not dismissing him as a crack).    Smolin ends his books with a reflection on the general state of science in the US.  He paints a bleak picture of a highly \\"professionalized\\" discipline which rewards those low-risk research programs most likely to garner large grants, and a culture where reliable technical skill is valued more than risky and innovative ideas.    Even if you disagree with Smolin's assertions (and I am sure that there are many who do), he is compelling writer with interesting things to say.

B000XPU5NY|3.0|I recently picked this up. No I didn't download it or anything. I figured I'd give some of these later Genesis songs a chance via live exposure. I may have done better getting some of the older live albums (that can be found anymore anyway) but this one is certainly decent.<br /><br />The Good: Excellent sound quality, if a bit too slick.<br /><br />Even better: Song selection EVENLY split between old Prog era material and the \\"Michelob years\\" era Genesis (cmon, the picture in the new Genesis book of Banks wearing a Michelob shirt is priceless, hehe). Its as if the band has taken a look at all their strengths and tried to even it out for both periods. Now some of the prog era material is still \\"medley-fied\\" but they do a lot more of it than any album since the \\"second edition\\" of Three Sides Live. Firth of Fifth is actually made an instrumental, and a damn good one at that, having Daniel Stuermer update the solos to almost shredder level (i.e John Petrucci, etc).<br /><br />The Carpet Crawlers (full song, vocals included) is another Highlight as it takes us back to the Peter Gabriel years. \\"Mama\\" sounds as good if not better than the album, and so does \\"Domino\\". Another highlight is big chunks of the \\"Duke suite\\" thrown in for good measure. Considering its likely my favorite Genesis album its a welcome surprise. \\"Land of Confusion\\" rocks harder than ever as well.<br /><br />The Bad: Phil Collins' vocals are in a very restrained mode (think Tarzan soundtrack) and lack the energy and grit of previous live performances and albums. Also, some songs fall flat compared to the albums. \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\" (hence the Michelob reference) sounds as flat as ten year old soda, as does \\"Throwing it All Away\\" and \\"I Can't Dance\\". Of course, i'm not a HUGE fan of those songs (though Tonight is growing on me certainly, especially the full 11 minute one) but nevertheless they sound phoned in.<br /><br />The Ugly: Yes, as some reviewers have it, SOME of the songs are played a bit slower. Its not a full scaling back of bpms but its certainly noticable. Another irking element is definitely the downtuning, can't singers just sing an octave lower and not try so hard because they can't hit the pitch anymore, instead of having to downtune the whole song, making it sound a lot different? This isn't an issue with the medley songs or even some of the other ones, but on some of the \\"brighter\\" hits (example: Invisible Touch) theres just \\"something wrong\\" seemingly. In fact, some of the prog instrumentals mostly avoid this (I think some may be just a half step or standard tuning for ya music theory geeks out there, I'll have to listen again).<br /><br />This isn't enough to kill the album, but its not always pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, because this is a GREAT gesture to recognize much of their prog past (they even play \\"Ripples\\" from Trick of the Tail), and it features some really good performances (example: Firth of Fifth, etc), I'll have to award it 3.5 stars.f bpms but its certainly noticable.

B00003CXAW|5.0|First there was KING KONG 1933. This is the unsurpassed classic fantasy, but I'll get back to that in a bit. Then there was KING KONG APPEARS IN EDO (Japanese) 1938. Unfortunately it's been reported that the film has been lost or destroyed. Maybe a copy will surface someday.  Then there was KING KONG vs GODZILLA 1962. This was honestly meant to be a tribute to the original classic for inspiring the Godzilla franchise. Why King Kong looked the way he did I'll never know. He looked pretty bad. But I still love that film. Then there was a King Kong cartoon called THE KING KONG SHOW 1966 where Kong is a friendly hero which inspired the live action movie KING KONG ESCAPES 1967. Which had by far the worst looking Kong suit, but for some reason I always enjoy that one too. Maybe because of Dr. Who voiced by Paul Frees (American dub) and Robot Kong. Now he looked awesome. Basic, but awesome. Speaking of Robot Kongs this leads to KING KONG 1976. If you were alive and aware of your own existance in the 70s You couldn't help but hear the hype of a brand new King Kong movie that was going to use a full sized mechanical Kong to star in this movie. But that just wasn't the case. The robotic Kong looked so terribly unconvincing they had to hire a man to design and wear a suit. At the time seemed to look convincing, but doesn't compare to the very realistic looking Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005. More of that in a moment. Then of course there was the forgettable KING KONG LIVES. Year of release also forgettable. KING KONG 2005 had the potential to be a fierce competitor to the original 1933 classic, but dropped the ball big time  by overdoing unecessary human character development and wasteful silly Kong moments. My personal edited version is really cool. It runs 2 hrs and 15 mins and makes perfect sense. The one thing that really stands out in my mind is; The natives in the 2005 version were truly horrible nasty people. If anyone should have been \\"Kong stomped\\", it was definatelythem. Women and children included. I now return to the 1933 masterpiece. Regardless as to the faults that people point out, this movie is perfection unto itself. The pacing is perfect. The matte shots are breathtaking. The acting is as it should be. Every moment counts. A terrified screaming female makes the most sense. Let's face it, no girl is going to fall in love with a 25 foot gorilla that kills innocent people no matter how sweet the music soundtrack is. The puppet animation in this movie set the standard for many generations to come and has never really been improved upon. I'm not referring to CGI, only Stop Motion filming. I remember one time they showed a heavily edited version of this on Channel 9 New York, five days in a row at 1 pm. I believe it was during the winter recess in the late 1960s. (Please chime in if you remember this or have factual information). No matter how you slice it Kong had to be killed off. He was a brutal vicious murderous beast, even in the sappy versions.  Even with the technology of today if anyone attempted to duplicte this movie exactly as it is. They would fail miserably because magic can't be duplicated. Thank goodness for this DVD.

B000JR0P6S|4.0|So at first I was gonna be a jerk and ruin everyone else's fun and go, \\"Sure, this is a good one but aren't there better examples of what this group can do?\\" But then I listened again. And again. And again. And the potency of this one really started to sink in. It's subtle potency, though, because this is a very subtle album. It was very carefully produced and arranged, resulting in an almost symphonic album - there's even a string section on \\"Midnight\\". It's like a modern Pet Sounds, only better. There's very little stripped-down funk-rock in attendance, but I think the band found their niche playing sophisticated, mature pop and only occasionally getting funky in the first place. As usual, the best songs in attendance are the singles: :the title track switches from melodic ballad to full-on funk, \\"Universally Speaking\\" is a tasty slab of Beatlesesque psychedelia with nice harmonies, the multi-part \\"Dosed\\" features nicely double-tracked guitars, \\"The Zephyr Song\\" is a sunny genre-blender (a little rap, a little alt-rock) that still sounds fresh after every listen, and \\"Can't Stop\\" is the only song that really harkens back to the early days, merging a tense guitar riff with a strong funk pulse. The key difference is that the lyrics, rather than being about sex, are instead about nothing at all. To make things even better, John Frusciante's solos are a delight (\\"Zephyr Song\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Dosed\\", \\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"Minor Thing\\"), and a combination of intricate arrangements and hummable melodies make some songs that got no airplay at all just as memorable as the big singles (\\"This is the Place\\", the two-part \\"Venice Queen\\", the romantic ballad \\"I Could Die for You\\", \\"Midnight\\", whose lyrics owe a strong debt to Smashing Pumpkins; the gorgeous Beach Boys-esque \\"Tear\\", \\"Warm Tape\\"). And there is one powerful funk-rocker, the protest \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". Plus the lyrics are fantastic: Anthony Kiedis comes off as an intelligent middle-aged man reflecting on the assorted directions his life has taken, though \\"Cabron\\" (A Mexican slang term, as in \\"Isaac Hayes is one bad cabron\\") could've been written by a hormonal middle-schooler strangely fascinated with both Mexican folk and country music. A few five-minute running times slow things down a bit, but not to the point where it really detracts from the value. Besides, that's only to be expected when you give an indulgent group SIXTEEN TRACKS AND SIXTY-EIGHT MINUTES (as advertised on the sticker on my copy - talk about being open about your flaws) of music to deal with. Maybe... fourteen tracks and an hour would've worked better. \\"Cabron\\" is awful; as is \\"On Mercury\\", whose chugging harmonica and bizarre lyrics and harmonies make it reek of stupid novelty. But on a whole this is a gorgeous, heartfelt, thought-out album. I'm normally not one to praise or harp on a record because of its production, but it's really a large part of what makes this so good. Hey, get rid of either \\"Cabron\\" or \\"On Mercury\\" and it's my favorite Chilis record. Get rid of both, and it's a masterpiece.e assorted directions his life has taken, though \\"Cabron\\" (A Mexican slang term, as in \\"Isaac Hayes is one bad cabron\\") could've been written by a hormonal middle-schooler strangely fascinated with both Mexican folk and country music.

B000U1ZVDA|3.0|The purchase was smooth. However this is the second HD movie of the same title that has had playback problems. The movie pauses at certain sections of the movie. Amazon sent me a new one to replace the first one and the NEW one did the exact same thing. I even called Toshiba and they said that there is nothing wrong with my player...it has to be a software problem with that particular movie. So if anyone has this movie on HD beware!
B00000DFSK|4.0|Part of me can understand why some people hate U2 as passionately as they do. They were (and, if the success of the recent U23D is any indicator, remain) huge.  I'll admit even I got burned out on hearing all of their hits a million times a day. And Bono does come off as a bit pompous (especially on Rattle and Hum, the first true failure of their career), though unlike (for example) Mick Jagger, who bought his seventh or eighth house a couple years ago, he does good stuff with his money. Unlike Mick, he puts it where his mouth is. Wait a sec... Mick does. Okay, this has the potential to come out really, really wrong. Never mind. Forget I said that. Back to square one.<br />But anyway, despite all that I still think U2 is a great band, even though I don't listen to their studio albums all that often, fantastic as War and The Unforgettable Fire and Boy and the Joshua Tree and All That You Can't Leave Behind are. I mean, if I feel like listening to U2 I can just turn on the radio and I'll hear ten of their songs in an hour. This is probably the U2 album I listen to most, because my cousin (cool guy, by the way) is a pretty big U2 fan, and whenever I see him (which is quite often, considering he now only lives twenty minutes away, as opposed to two hours as he used to, even though he had a sweet house back then), we ALWAYS play this and usually spin War or The Joshua Tree (my two favorites) as well. Good times.<br />But here's the point: If you just want a place to start your U2 collection, it doesn't really get much better than this. I would've liked \\"Gloria\\" (from their second album, October, which is decidedly hit-or-miss), but other than that it's got all their significant hits from the '80s, which were great. Oh yeah, I could complain about how \\"Anh Cat Dubh\\", \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\", \\"I Fall Down\\", \\"With a Shout\\", \\"Seconds\\", \\"Two Hearts Beat as One\\", \\"Wire\\", \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\", \\"Running to Stand Still\\", \\"One Tree Hill\\", \\"Exit\\", \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" and so forth were left off, and there are too many edits. But it does contain the basics - \\"Where the Streets Have No Names\\", \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", \\"Bad\\" and all the others that have made them one of the most imitated bands in recent history. I think my favorite U2 track, contained here, is \\"New Year's Day\\", though I also really like \\"With or Without You\\".<br />U2 were great in the '80s, a time when nobody else really was (except for Prince, R.E.M. and Stevie Ray Vaughan, no other new artists really had much going for them). They've got a distinct sound, a solid rhythm section, and the Edge playing some fine guitar. And Bono. Love him or hate him, you have to admit he's been influential.

B000ZOXDFA|2.0|Although I absolutely love the first film and recognize that this movie is not supposed to be a duplication of that....it is without a doubt a grade z fluff piece. What disappointed me the most was that Cate Blanchett signed on to make this movie. Sure...its pretty to look at but I really felt it was thin on plot, thin on dialogue, and thin on history. I can think of lots of movies with well lit shots and introspectve looks on actors' faces.

1416524800|1.0|This book was so bad that I might give up reading for the rest of my life to avoid a repeat experience. I took it on a flight and had nothing else to read, so I kept going hoping it would get better. By the end, I wanted to open the emergency exit and leap out to end my misery. It is formulaic and implausible, with plot twists as a substitute for actual plot. Erase my memory, please, and give me back my 5 hours.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Brick is a strange animal that seems to appear almost out of nowhere. A lot of people my have come here because they've heard about this movie and haven't yet seen it. Some of you may have come here because you tried to watch it but had to turn it off because you couldn't understand what the hell they were talking about.<br /><br />Let me suggest this: TURN ON THE SUBTITLES.<br /><br />Yeah, I know it's in English and you recognize the main character from that TV show: Third Rock from The Sun, but this isn't a sitcom on NBC, and this isn't your typical run-of-the-mill, teen flavored High School drama. In Brick, you're about as far from John Hughes territory as your going to get and closer to the backyard of [[ASIN:1883011671 Dashiell Hammett]] and [[ASIN:1883011078 Raymond Chandler]] than you might realize.  As a huge fan of [[ASIN:B000FFJYA2 The Big Sleep]], I was really caught of guard by this film and stunned when I realized just what was going on. Seeing 1940's film noir, soaked in a teen centered tale of woe, works better than I would've ever thought. And for the record, I don't think anyone, other than the writer dared attempt something like this and succeed at it too. Bravo.<br /><br />Rian Johnson makes a writing and directorial debut to rival most of his peers and mentors. This film is enough to make the Gods tremble, hopefully he'll be able to follow it up appropriately. On a side note, Rian offers up his screenplay, the novella he wrote that goes with it, an essay and drawings for no charge on his site, which is easily found, if you're interested in reading.<br /><br />Nora Zehetner as the smoldering and cold-calculating heroine is also a definite high point, and her career and longevity in films is assured.<br /><br />This film could easily be the [[ASIN:B000K15VSA Blade Runner]] of this generation.

B000069HSP|5.0|[Note:  This comment was originally posted at IMDb.com but was later censored by the staff on the grounds that they had a complaint.  I leave it up to the reader to decide if any sane, reasonable person would find anything offensive about what was said here.]        Vietnam -- It's Legacy, It's Lessons for Us Today, 25 May 2005     This film touched my heart in the way it showed the valor, the commitment, the utter devotion and supreme dedication of those whose awful task it was to go to Vietnam and suffer and die, or suffer and live (in many cases a fate worse than death), all for nothing.     Well, it wasn't exactly for nothing, was it?. Many made fortunes off that war, and it is the contrast of the dedication of these great patriots, misguided and downright misled though they were, with the behind-the-scenes corruption and greed that used Communism as an excuse to wage a no-win war at the expense of human life that I wish to address.    I must say the movie did a good job in portraying just how awful it was to have to endure all that over there in Vietnam, and it gave me a new respect for those who went through it all.    Frankly, I didn't make it past the first jungle scene or two before I had to switch off. I couldn't bear to watch all that suffering and dying... all in vain. I was looking at this story of the war in Vietnam with hindsight, since I knew how it was going to end, and my heart groaned over that waste of human life that was going to accomplish nothing good.     We were never meant to win.        Vietnam stank of Machiavellianism on an international scale.    Nicolo Machiavelli was a sub-human parasite. He was a master at profiting from wars and disputes between peoples. If there was no conflict going at the moment he would try to instigate one, and then pretend to befriend both sides behind both their backs. By controlling the purse strings he could keep each side from getting too dominant and annihilating the other, thereby destroying that side'sability to pay off the war debt and also keeping the conflict alive as long as possible. Can we see any resemblance to the Vietnam war here? People back here at home smelled a rat and hated the war. Maybe they couldn't put their finger on the problem, but they knew something was deeply wrong. There was some talk about America having lost her resolve to make the world safe for democracy. Why should the world's greatest power not be able to bring a two-bit country like North Vietnam to its knees, they wanted to know, and couldn't articulate why not.    It wasn't about resolve, it was about money, and sacrificing human life to feed the economy and line the pockets of the ones who stood to gain at the expense of our fighting men's very lives.    The problem is that some of those people who opposed the war also hated our own soldiers for participating in the war. It is in the honor of those valiant men that this review is dedicated. They were patriots and should never have been mistreated by their own, no matter how misguided or exploited they were. They didn't question, they just obeyed. They followed orders, as they were taught to do.    I can't speak for the Army of today, but I can tell you about how it was back in the sixties. Independent thought was discouraged. You were taught to follow orders without question. Military life may always be so. It always has been, that's for sure. I remember one of the Dirty Dozen movies where there was a mission given the dozen to kill some general who planned to assassinate Hitler. The sharpshooter had the general in his sights but the problem was that Hitler was there too, and he thought Hitler made a better target. I remember Lee Marvin's character saying several times,\\"Just the general\\".    He knew that the higher ups in America wanted Hitler alive so he could keep on making his strategic blunders and keep on losing the war for his country. But would Marvin's character confide that to his sniper underling? Not on your life. Just obey orders and do not ask questions was his approach to command.    When I took an oath upon joining the Army I remember I had to sign a paper giving up my rights under the Constitution of the United States of America, especially that of free speech. We were ushered into another room after the swearing-in where it was explained to us that we were now property of the U.S. Army. \\"GI\\" stands for government issue. You became a part of the weapons arsenal, with your own serial number, even. The power and control that is exerted over you is deep and intense. It is hard to imagine what pressure these men who went to Vietnam were subjected to in order to get them to fight this awful war.    All I can say for those poor, blind, and misguided souls who fought in Vietnam is may God bless them, both living and dead. I deeply appreciate their unselfish devotion to their country and to the oath they swore.    But also, may God curse those who exploited them so they could become rich. A curse on them and all that their filthy blood-soaked money ever built.    And a curse on all those who would repeat that abuse today --or in the future.    But let us not forget that we are supposed to be a government of, by, and for the people. In America, the government derives its power to govern from those governed. If we have let our country become a government of the people, by the politicians, for the special interest groups, if we refuse to discharge our obligation to remain ever vigilant over those whom we elect to run our country, then will the blood of those who fought and died (or else survived, broken and traumatized) not be on our heads as well?
B000P12LWY|5.0|Okay, I have to disagree with some of the reviews here. If you watch a Showtime miniseries for historical accuracy, then, duh, of course you're going to be disappointed!!   If you want to learn history, then read an authoritative source.   This is purely for entertainment, and (with the exception of Gabrielle Anwar - is it me or does she look like she's been backed over by a truck?) the show is beautifully cast.  Although JRM isn't as tall as Henry, who cares when he's so dead sexy?  Seriously.  I'm hooked.
B00005JMK0|5.0|That's what I wanna know.  But don't despair, Go to ebay and you'll find it there.  Such a great movie deserves more respect than this, I'm dissapointed, it's one of a kind, which i'm sure you will all agree.
0671798154|1.0|If there was a prize for the most politically correct novel of WWII, this book would win it hands down. Through out the book the main character wipes out all the bad guys (SS and Gestapo) while leaving the good guys (wehrmacht personnel, honest German policemen and German civilians) without a scratch. The farce reaches it's height when he gives a signed certificate to a German soldier attesting that he had been made to act under duress. Stick to Jack Higgins or AListair MacLean if you want fast paced WWII action

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Ratatouille receives very high scores from reviewers, here and elsewhere, and it totally lives up to it's high praise. This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen, and, to be honest, it was over far too quickly, despite being almost 2 hours long.    I'm not one to watch movies multiple times, but I can see myself watching this one quite a few times. It's really fun, and this Blu Ray version looks amazing.    Don't rent this one; buy it. It really is that good.

B00005MP58|5.0|1996's BBC production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, is likely the standard dramatization of Jane Austen's romantic novel.  For viewers not addicted to Masterpiece Theater, its point of comparison is the 2005 theatrical release starring Matthew MacFadyen and Keira Knightley, which offsets a compressed version of the story with visually stunning production values and its attractive leading stars.<br /><br />The BBC version very closely follows the original novel.  It features a fascinating variety of detailed Regency settings and costumes.  The characters, including the Bennett family, are fully developed people.  Mr Bennett's patient patriach is in stark contrast to Mrs. Bennett's brashness and palpable desperation to marry off her five daughters.  Elizabeth's sister Mary, all but a cypher in the 2005 movie, is here fleshed out in priggish contrast to her flirtatious but foolish sister Lydia.  Mr Collins, the ordained cousin of the Bennetts, is repellently simpering, obsequious, and obnoxious, making Elizabeth's spinster friend Charlotte's decision to marry him for security a more difficult choice to swallow.  In contrast, Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins in the 2005 movie is more humorously inept than truly offensive.<br /><br />The real attraction of the BBC version is the slowly evolving relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, here played out in great detail and with a delicious subtlety.  Jennifer Ehler's Elizabeth is older and visibly headstrong.  Her investment in her first impression of Mr. Darcy has an edge no doubt sharpened by the class distinctions that underlie Mr Darcy's initial objections to the Bennetts and to Elizabeth herself.  Colin Firth's Mr Darcy is less sure of himself and more vulnerable than Matthew MacFadyen's shy but competent take in the 2005 movie.  His interest in Elizabeth is visible earlier on, making his proposal of marriage to Elizabeth less of a surprise than Matthew MacFadyen's thunderclap announcement in the later movie.  The slow dance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy toward a mutual understanding has the genuine push and pull of two strong-minded people.<br /><br />This BBC adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.  Those whose introduction to this story was the 2005 movie will find the 1996 version to be a much fuller evocation of Jane Austen's enduring novel.'s thunderclap announcement in the later movie.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|I received a HD-DVD Xbox add on for Christmas and bought Planet Earth to show off the 1080p and this is absolutely beautiful.    One has to remember that this is a nature film and as in nature there are some images caught on film that may not be for the faint of heart.  If you are a little squeamish you may have to avert your eyes now and again.    For the most part the images are breathtaking.  How they captured some of the scenes I will never know, there are times (such as in Caves) the camera seems to float over areas that you know they couldn't do a fly over.    Although everyone is claiming that HD-DVD has lost the format wars this is one DVD that I am glad to have in my collection.  This is a definate purchase for anyone with an HD-DVD or Blu-Ray player.
0374105235|5.0|Wow!  What more can one say?  This is probably one of my favorite books, which sounds a bit sadistic given what the book is about.<br /><br />Ishmeal Beah must be commended for sharing with us his story and memories.  You do get a sense that some of his worst memories are probably hidden within him, as sometimes the story looses its flow, and jumps and bumps a little along the way, which can be forgiven, since for much of his boy soldiering he was high at the time.  You do get a good feel for the author's loss of childhood, and can easily loose yourself in his pain.  The author gives so much however; that in the end it's a relief to know something positive happens in his life.<br /><br />This was a good plug for UNICEF, which I always wondered about having traveled overseas quite a bit and been asked to donate my spare currency upon my return flights.  It's nice to know they are doing good things, as in this case, having helped rehabilitate the author from a boy solider back to a boy again.<br /><br />My only one small complaint, as if I should have one, is in how the story ends.  Don't get me wrong; I enjoy how the author ended it.  But, I would like to have read more about what happened to him after he came to America.  Perhaps we'll get to read another book?

B000001FTH|3.0|I bought the cassette not too long after it came out in 1985. I knew of Grace Jones, of course, and heard some of her music on radio and TV and in the clubs. But I did not really appreciate her until I got the tape --which I loved from beginning to end -- the most stirring for me was her version of La Vie En Rose -- quite a unique interpretation!<br />So you can imagine my excitement as CD players became more common, when I discovered it was re-issued as a CD in 1990. I bought it immediately and was immediately disappointed. The sound had none of the stirrings that the tape had -- nothing shivered in your system when she reached her powerful notes.  I played the two for a number of friends and everyone agreed the tape's sound was significantly better. It was not my equipment -- I had top of the line of everything.  So I continued to play the tape but I couldn't in my car -- one of the times I most like to listen to music -- because I had installed a new CD player -- and the gizmos designed to let you play tapes through it were pretty bad.<br /><br />It was just sloppy work -- this issue of the CD. Every company was slapping their hit albums onto Cd's -- some with care -- some not. This one fell into the later category.<br /><br />Grace sort of faded from my mind after several years -- music outside jazz and some classical no longer came across my radar screen. But about a year ago -- thanks to a great station in my area (WRNR) -- I started to get interested in more \\"rock\\" music again (I know that \\"rock\\" means something more specific now -- there are so many genres within it -- but I use the term as it used to be used -- comprehensively of all the related genres) and then I saw the movie \\"La Vie En Rose\\" about Piaf and Grace's version of the song came to mind -- and I started watching a number of videos of her performances on YouTube and now I am here on Amazon wondering if better releases -- in terms of quality -- have appeared.<br /><br />Others here are more knowledgeable about her discography -- but Island Life to me was perfect from beginning to end. But the CD version -- as is sold here --fell completely flat.phy -- but Island Life to me was perfect from beginning to end. But the CD version -- as is sold here --fell completely flat.

B000X3KZVI|1.0|I am just writing this to help other customers avoid this type of seller called \\"Caiman\\".  Straight to the point. I bought it  a week early before bestbuy got it only for cheaper. I ended up paying $32 dollars with shipping when you can find it bestbuy for under $20. The other problem I had from this item was that it was international and there was no way I could play the dvd. The seller had this item under regional when it wasn't. I gave to my sister as a christmas present she is been waiting for a refund or a exchange. She got tired and when to buy at bestbuy.   I am still waiting to get a refund or a exchange since the begining of January and as of today they told that they haven't received my returned item. I don't about other sellers but the safer way is to buy it directly from the store and not a seller. Directly from amazon if it ever becomes available or bestbuy.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|First, the good news: the climax of 'Death Proof' is probably the most thrilling cinematic car chase I've seen since 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior'. And since you're watching this on DVD, you can skip through all the boring bits rather than waste an hour watching what must have been Quentin Tarantino's attempt to get in touch with his feminine side and prove that he could write dialogue for women.<br /><br />!!!  SPOILER WARNING  !!!<br /><br />The first half of the movie follows a group of attractive women as they head out for a night drinking and meet the murderous Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell as a pretty scary villain), who then kills them in his 'death proof' car. The local sheriff decides that since he has no evidence it was murder, he's not going to do anything, and doesn't. We then meet another four women passing through the same town, two of them stunt performers, who are re-enacting a scene from 'Vanishing Point' when Stuntman Mike starts chasing them.<br /><br />Now that you've read this, you don't have to watch that part of the movie, which drags much more than it races. Yes, we get some likeable eye candy, some tension, we see how the monster works, but do we really need an hour of this? The Drew Barrymore scene at the beginning of 'Scream' gained our sympathy and had just as much impact in a fraction of the time.<br /><br />I pity anyone who sat through this in a cinema, but not as much as I pity the ones who fell asleep or walked out from boredom - because if you're into edge-of-your-seat high-octane excitement, the final scene is hard to beat. Unfortunately, the lead-up feels as though the editor fell asleep at the wheel, when he should have just put his foot on the accelerator. Get the DVD, but be prepared to fast-forward. A lot.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Yes, great film...perhaps the greatest for myriad reasons many of us know and those who do not should excitedly discover on their own.  But has anyone ever commented until now that in addition to being an examination of the title character, CITIZEN KANE contains a devastating, damning commentary on the basic idiocy of most \\"investigative\\" reporters - in this case the \\"truth\\"-seeking Thompson.  But was it intentional - or a script oversight - that when Raymond the Butler is giving his two cents worth (in his case actually a thousand bucks worth!) to the meaning of Rosebud.....Thompson - a basic idiot-in-the-shadows (is this then why he is always in shadows?  To show he is the man-in-the-dark...the man who cannot see what is before him? Who can't even do his job well!) - when Thompson is told by Raymond that Kane utters the word \\"Rosebud\\" both when Susan left him and he pocketed \\"something\\" and \\"that other time\\" when he dropped the glass ball - yet Thompson does NOT even ask what the hell the glass ball was! If he had known it was of a snow scene he might have had the wits to trace it back to young Kane's winter of discontent when the bank seized hold of him and stole him from his beloved sleigh.  How dumb could one get?  (Perhaps as dumb as many investigative reporters are who fail to deliver the goods or come up with erroneous nonsense that they pass off as truth - or WMDs?) Anyway - I will forever wonder if Thompson's not picking up the \\"ball\\"(in this case albeit a glass, smashed one) was intentional by the makers of KANE or was Thompson just tired at the end of the day or was this a script glitch?  Also not mentioned - to my knowledge - is the preponderance of fireplaces in the film...leading up to the end one which consumes the secret for all time.  (Notice the fireplace directly behind the young Kane when he is given a new sleigh by Thatcher - portent of things to come.)  One other thing that I have never seen mentioned in commentaries of the film is this:  the great Kane-as-a-boy snow scene....the snowman....it is a forecast of the endless statues that the elder Kane will collect; plus...it somewhat looks like the bald-domed, fatter Kane when we last see him: in the Colorado scene we thereby have child and future man, together.  The fact that a snowman is frozen- as Kane is emotionally frozen (especially at the end of the film after Susan leaves) is another point to be considered. So when we first see the dying Kane he God-like holds his past world in his hand, yet being a limited human being afterall (despite Kane's seeming unlimitness of power and money, etc) he cannot enter the scene in the ball...just like he cannot return to that moment in Time.  Conversely, when we first see Kane as a boy, he is in the world of the glass ball - but that world is also about to be shattered by the adults who plot his future within the confines of the warm boarding house. It is then - from this interior - that we see child Kane framed...as he is also about to  be \\"framed\\" for a crime he did not commit and sentenced to a life of wealth and riches he never asked for - or may have ever even wanted.  In both cases, however, the dying Kane at the film's opening and the first time we see K as a child - in both instances, he is....alone.  Existentially alone in a frozen world that only the human heart and hearthside can warm. One last thing to anyone familiar with the music of Rachmaninoff:  listen to his magnificent tone poem \\"Isle of the Dead\\" and you will hear what is essentially the Kane motif throughout it.  I absolutely love the music of Bernard Herrmann but cannot help thinking he was influenced - however subconsciously - by Rachmaninoff's piece.  Even the painting that Rachmaninoff based his tone poem on is reminiscent of Xanadu, somewhat.  Anyway - CITIZEN KANE is the ultimate film about ALL of us....not just powerful, multimillionaire publishers....but ALL of us...because we ALL have a \\"Rosebud\\" in our souls and minds that will be on our lips when the curtain closes.  \\"Rosebud\\" is, in its most basic form, the desire we all share to....start again, conquer Time, turn back the clock and NOT have die and end our dreams or our bodies.  This is what ultimately makes KANE....a CITIZEN.n our lips when the curtain closes.  \\"Rosebud\\" is, in its most basic form, the desire we all share to....start again, conquer Time, turn back the clock and NOT have die and end our dreams or our bodies.  This is what ultimately makes KANE....a CITIZEN.
B000AP04OM|2.0|...and I could have gone the rest of my life without having seen it.  It was cheesy, slow in spots, and way too much singing.  It was hard to see what the whole point of it was.  I did like the nuns, though.  They were great.  I really didn't care anything about the characters and the movie was off the scale in terms of realism.  I know this is based on a true story, but the whole singing just ruined any shred of hope and realism for this movie.  I must have made my wife mad to have her torture me with this!
0786838655|3.0|My first problem with this book is that there was a lot of talk about Greek mythology in a Latin class. That just seemed like an odd setup. The author could have made it any class he wanted, and chose to make such an odd pair. It grated on me every time it came up.    Although the idea of using Greek mythology is quite clever, the story itself is fairly trite. Our \\"hero\\" is possibly one of the dumbest 6th-graders ever. It could be that he was written that way on purpose so as to allow for long expositions by other characters, but I found it annoying that he could not pick up on what was staring him in the face.    Perhaps my many problems with this book came from the fact that I listened to it, and the narrator decided to tell the whole story in his surfer-dude voice. Any seriousness there may have been to the story itself was completely driven out by this. If this is the reason I didn't like the book, it's a pity, because I'd heard really good things about this series. If I ever decide to read the next two books, I'll make sure to actually read them myself.
B000BB96MG|2.0|I didn't like it. I didn't read the book or the reviews here and I just saw the movie yesterday on TV, so everything is still fresh in my mind and untainted (so sorry for any redundancy in the negativity department). A few days before (coincidentally) I saw the 1971 musical for the umpteenth time, so I can compare and contrast. (Again, I didn't read the book so i don't care about the film's faithfulness to its literary precursor). I didn't mind that C&TCF was dark or starred Johnny Depp or wasn't a musical or had Burton's crazy American-style German Expressionism or anything like that. The kids were boring, maybe good actors in reality but who can tell here? Not much is required of them like in the 1971 film where you could imagine the young cast was selected from some real-life wonka-sized contest for precocity. The kids in C&TCF are flat. Look at Violet: boring before and after her purple blueberry episode; Veruca? she doesn't hold a candle to the original who gave probably the best child perfomance ever on film in her role as the screeching daddy-hating selfish priss. And I'm not a fan of musicals, so what I'm saying should hit home. For a film about the magic of creativity there was little magic here. The orange clownish oompa loompas were infinitely more scary than the chicano-looking oompa loompas here; probably because clowns can be terrifying. Also I'm somewhat biased: whenever Gene Wilder steps into a scene there's always a wild gag-humor air about him even when nothing is said or done. Johnny Depp can't duplicate that.
B000J4QWM2|5.0|if you can't enjoy this film, then most likely your IQ is somewhat average to below average.  This is a thinking man's crime-thriller, with a miami twist on \\"modern-noir\\".  The score is amazing, the acting gritty and real, and the cinematography is orgasmic. literally. have tissues available.    In the end, if you weren't fond of this film, watch it again, and realize it's destined to be a classic Mann creation.  If you haven't seen this yet, please go and treat yourself to some drugs, sex, violence, and suspense that will have you thinking far after the credits role.
B0013ANMWY|1.0|I love cheesy science fiction. Mole people, giant insects, nuclear mutants, sure.  I'm okay with remakes that are well done.  But this remake of \\"Invasion of the Bodysnatchers\\" is terrible!  Kidman's prescription-happy psychiatrist who is inexplicably linked to the high-powered Washington elite makes no sense, the child is pretty well annoying, and her emotions for the cardboard \\"not-a-boyfriend\\" boyfriend played by Daniel Craig are unclear through most of the film.  Not to pick on Kidman specifically, since the other characters in the film were equally wooden, but her haircut made more of an impression on me than the plot.  Really, given the quality of actors assembled for the cast, I have to wonder whether to blame the script or the director.  Skip it and watch the original - some remakes should have stayed in the dream vault, and this is one of them.

0307277887|4.0|Here is the skinny. I bought the books and the 1st sesion dvd all at the same time. I watched the DVD's first. IT was AWESOME!! Clever and witty. Then I read the first book in the series. The Show was actually much better by far. I have yet to see the 2nd season, I am waiting for the dvd release. But I have moved on to the 2nd novel. It is a good read. Basically if you have to choose between the dvd or the book. Take the DVD the story line is much better and much more different from the book.
B00005JNQA|1.0|For the first half of the movie I thought \\"The Interpreter\\" was going to be good. Then it got bogged down in twists and turns that happened so fast one hardly had time to figure out what was going on.  In the second half, new and undeveloped characters galloped in and then out. It was hardly satisfying when one finally learned who the really bad guys were because even the \\"good\\" guys seemed like bad guys. I believe I could have understood the plot better if I watched it a second time, but I have no desire to do so because I never found much reason to care what happened.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of either Nicole Kidman or Sean Penn, but her nearly lifeless portrayal of Silvia made Sean's Secret Service man look really interesting.  Kidman does not act at all using her face ... it is almost frozen and pretty much unchanging, we have no idea what her inner emotions are.  She seems to be a one-note actress wherever she appears. But Penn's face is excellent at letting us know what the interior man is feeling.  As he has aged, it seems to me that he has gone past the arrogance and shrillness he once displayed in almost every role.<br /><br />It was the plot in the second half of the movie, however, that did me in ... car chases, explosions, failures of surveillance officers to keep track of whoever they're trailing, and the refusal of Kidman's character to reveal what the cops needed to know ... just didn't jell or make sense.<br /><br />Probably a good thing the two main characters went their separate ways ... Penn displayed a poignant sense of grief for his dead wife, Kidman hardly changed expression as she went through her brother's papers.  The plot badly needed simplification and cleaning up.  Too many undeveloped characters as well.  In addition, somewhere in the film the moviemakers might have found a way to make us care.

B000YCLRBA|5.0|The productions of Robert Carsen, though usually informed by an individual style, tend to be predictable only for their being polarizing. When his approach jells (when he has not decided that, say, IL TROVATORE should be a searing indictment of the petrochemical industry), one sees a kind of minimalism that (pace the editorial review above) is quite the opposite of \\"stark.\\" Carsen has the talent and the insight to do well what some of his lesser contemporaries do badly. He knows that the bare minimum of props and subtle shifts in lighting and color in place of traditional stagecraft can lend a production mechanical ease and fluidity while in no way precluding lyric beauty or kinetic energy. A poignant tone is set for this ONEGIN by the literally autumnal look of its first half: during the prelude, the bereft Onegin is showered in brown and orange leaves that remain on the stage for the next several scenes. When the peasants pay tribute to Larina with a joyous rustic dance, it is not a meticulously choreographed display of grace and athleticism (as later dances, in more formal and sophisticated settings, will be) -- it looks chaotic, spontaneous, even amateurish, just as such a demonstration would be if one were in the village observing it. The early-morning duel between Onegin and Lensky is masterfully staged. The two men sing their respective interior monologues in preparation for the deadly showdown neither wants, and each reaches his hand out in the direction of the other, from a distance that is slight yet unbridgeable. The staging makes clear that this is a representational and not a literal gesture, and the moment is heartbreaking. The subsequent silhouetted portrayal of Lensky's shooting, followed by the bright sun rising on Onegin, his soul irreparably stained, is both arresting and haunting.     But Carsen's greatest triumph is his demonstration of what usually is an asset even in his unsuccessful productions: an eye for subtext, and an ability to tease itout without assaulting his audience with it. This ONEGIN is not, as ONEGIN often is made to be, simply a tale of two people who would be a good match but have unfortunately misaligned timing; nor is it about a contemptible snob who gets his comeuppance in the end. Carsen astutely takes his cue from the first conversation we hear in the opera, that between Mother Larina and the nanny Filippyevna, both of whom loved and were loved passionately in youth but were led by pragmatism, duty, or necessity down a different path. \\"Heaven sends us habit instead of happiness,\\" observes Larina, and in the next two and a half hours we will see our heroine, Tatyana, assume her place among these women. Along with habit, heaven can send us heartbreak.     In the principal roles, Renée Fleming, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, and Ramón Vargas are in sovereign voice, and the soprano in particular is a revelation. I will confess that while her work in the past has hardly been thoughtless, I did not believe she had a performance of such behavioral specificity and dramatic perception in her (accompanying mini-doc footage suggests a fruitful partnership between her, Hvorostovsky, and Peter McClintock, director of this 2007 revival of Carsen's production). From the opera's opening through the birthday party, Fleming precisely evokes an ingenuous and romantic young person on the precipice of womanhood: a gesture or expression of distinctly girlish excitement or impulsivity may be followed in short order by one that is more wistful or circumspect, suggesting the woman she will become. Her work has a marvelous reactive spontaneity. When Tatyana reappears in the opera's final two scenes as a society woman of refinement and reserve, we are right there with Onegin in admiring the transformation, but we (like Fleming, Carsen, and McClintock) know that while something precious has been gained, something equally precious has been extinguished, or at least will never burn so brightly again: zest, eagerness, trust, innocence. Heaven has brought something, and heaven has taken something in payment.      Hvorostovsky, who has performed the title role with distinction for many years, recently has indicated a readiness to set it aside -- in that event, we are fortunate now to have deluxe documentation of his late thoughts on the character to supplement his earlier ones (on the Bychkov/Philips audio recording). It would be difficult to imagine a more ideal match of singer with character than Hvorostovsky with this vain, preeningly handsome, emotionally careless (but never uncaring) protagonist. Another of Carsen's shrewd touches, deftly enacted by Hvorostovsky, is to have Onegin barely pay attention to Lensky's initial round of charges at the birthday party. At a point when Onegin still has a window in which to defuse tension and avert tragedy, he does not even look at his angry friend; he remains seated, smirking and downing food and drink as if he is Giovanni patronizing a desperate Elvira. As has been noted elsewhere, Vargas's build, clothing, coif, and spectacles give this Lensky a striking (and apt, if intended) physical resemblance to another fragile, doomed poet/artist, Franz Schubert. Vargas is not the actor that his co-stars are, and is less comfortable with the Russian language than is any other featured singer on the stage, but when such gratifying lyric singing as his represents the weakest link, we obviously are dealing with a roster of unusual depth. Elena Zaremba (Olga) and especially Sergei Aleksashkin (a Gremin who quite looks the part) maintain the high musical standard; in smaller roles, Svetlana Volkova (Larina) and Larisa Shevchenko (Filippyevna) make their crucial points with warmth and appeal.     Celebrity maestros often are fascinating to watch at work for their varying methods: Karajan's eyes-closed shamanistic sculpting; Bernstein's emotional and occasionally overwrought balletic demonstrations; Muti's solemn-faced aristocratic precision; Abbado's genial coaxing and nudging; Carlos Kleiber's exuberant elasticity; Richard Strauss's minimalist economy of means. And then, on some quite different list, there is Valery Gergiev, one of the least fetching conductors in terms of gesture and expression  I have ever seen. The best description I can offer of his batonless technique to someone who has never seen it: imagine the imitation of a flamboyantly effeminate sorcerer by someone who despises that sorcerer. But however he chooses to communicate, he is no impediment to the Met Orchestra's predictably sumptuous reading of Tchaikovsky's score. The conductor's only truly questionable judgments are the taffy-pulling of Triquet's number (the tenor singing Triquet is obliged to serenade Tatyana at the slowest tempo I have ever heard in the piece, and then, as if to make up for lost time, the chorus's admiring responses are rushed -- it is rather like the release of a slingshot), and a too-hectic tempo for the dance music in the penultimate scene. On the whole, this ONEGIN deserves placement alongside the Scotto/Domingo MANON LESCAUT, the Troyanos TROYENS, and select others among the finest Met performances yet preserved for home viewing.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Across the Universe is an epic, psychedelic Beatlemaniac romp through the 1960s. It's not a movie for everyone, but fans of the Beatles and people interested in, or nostalgic for the 60s should enjoy it. The film is a hybrid of musical fantasy, with all of the characters' names coming from Beatles' songs, and social history as played out in the lives of a small group of people. Jim Sturgess plays Jude, an Englishman in search of his father in the U.S. His father, who turns out to be a janitor at Princeton, is something of a disappointment, but he finds new friends, especially Max (Joe Anderson) and his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Obviously, Jude and Lucy fall in love, while Max deals with his own problems, most notably being drafted and sent to Vietnam. These three characters all do a great job expressing the confusion, idealism and a certain naivete that the 60s embodied, at least within a certain milieu.<br /><br />As far as I know, this is only the second film, the first being Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978) that is based on the Beatle's music (excluding, of course, movies that the Beatles themselves were in). Being a teenager in the late 70s who was just starting to appreciate the Beatles, I actually enjoyed Sgt. Pepper, though I have since learned almost everyone else, especially critics, hated it! I'll have to watch that again now and see if I can spot its flaws. Back to the present film -I loved Across the Universe. I found it to be an almost perfect synthesis of Beatle's music (sung surprisingly well), a dramatic look at the political unrest of the 1960s and a moving romance between two young lovers.<br /><br />While the film inevitably has a predictable boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back story line (what musical doesn't?), along with an equally inevitable nostalgia for the 1960s, what surprised me was how well it captured the dark side of that era. The film deals with people killed in Vietnam, the angst of being drafted, the violence of race and anti-war riots, and the often bitter struggle between the political and hedonistic aspects of the 60s. The latter is well dramatized in the relationship between Lucy and Jude, as Lucy become radicalized while Jude feels estranged from the politics and the two drift apart.<br /><br />Across The Universe manages to weave in many surreal and psychedelic scenes into the otherwise conventional plot -all fitting in with the musical score, of course. I found almost all of the music very well done, but some outstanding numbers were Joe Cocker doing Come Together, Bono playing a Ken Kesey inspired character (who drives a hippy bus) singing I Am  the Walrus.  The lead actors mostly do a great job with the music, including Anderson's rendition of Hey Jude near the end. If the songs are not always up to the standards set by the Beatles, this is not detrimental to the film. In fact, the sometimes less than perfect singing actually gives the movie a greater sense of authenticity, making us feel that we are watching  real characters rather than a whole cast of accomplished musicians.<br /><br />I regret having missed this on the big screen, and the DVD is one I will probably want to own. I think this movie will appeal more strongly to those already familiar with the Beatle's music, but anyone who appreciates music and the spirit of young love and rebellion can appreciate this film, which works on several levels -musically, visually and dramatically.ace and anti-war riots, and the often bitter struggle between the political and hedonistic aspects of the 60s.

0385733577|3.0|Somewhat engaging, with plenty of different characters and challenges and dire escapes galore. Some interesting esoteric references and even a little physics (parallel worlds), but without the really \\"real\\" characters and creations of a true children's/young adult classic. Certainly a lot of opportunities for special effects for the movie \\"The Golden Compass\\". Don't even think about \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" - just a little extra chapter that could have gone into the book.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|Perhaps the most misbegotten film in recent memory, \\"Perfume\\" veers from period melodrama to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" slasher to bad acid trip, with a final detour into a road production of \\"Oh Calcutta.\\" The director seems not to know what kind of film he wants to make, so he allows some usually good actors to flounder around and make fools of themselves. Dustin Hoffman thinks he's remaking \\"Hook,\\" Alan Rickman thinks he's in a BBC production of \\"Emma\\" and the women think they're doing a Chanel perfume ad. The lead actor is pretty to look at and has perfected a constipated expression that's supposed to be a dark secret, but every time he opens his mouth he sounds like he's auditioning for \\"Oliver\\" with a broad Cockney accent that's completely out of place. Nothing in most of the film prepares you for the ending, which is out-and-out laughable. A sad waste of money and a mostly talented cast.

B000ROALCG|5.0|I bought this album for my wife and she loves it.  If you are into Marc Anthony and his style,  this album is fantastic.  You don't need to have seen the film to enjoy it.<br /><br />The only complaint was that its only like 39 minutes.

B0012XT6WM|5.0|REVIEWS taken from the the iMDB:    \\"A legendary propaganda/documentary of the Third Reich's 1934 Nuremberg Party Rally. Featuring a cast of thousands as well as, of course, Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Hess, Goering and other top party officials.\\" -Written by Dawn M. Barclift    \\"Triumph of the Will was commissioned by Hitler in 1934 and directed by Leni Riefenstahl, and covers the events of the Sixth Nuremberg Party Congress. The original intention was to document the early days of the NSDAP, so future generations could look back and see how the Third Reich began. In reality, Triumph of the Will shows historians how the Nazi state drew in the masses through propaganda and also how Adolf Hitler had a unique and terrifying ability to entice crowds to his beliefs by the very power of his words.\\" -Written by Anthony Hughes      Author's Note: This Five Star Rating is NOT because I agree with the contents of this propaganda film, HOWEVER... it is important as an educational tool. Especially for children and young adults. All that glitters is NOT gold.    There is nothing more this reviewer can add to the above comments of Barclift and Hughes.
0321544080|5.0|Some photography books are collections of great photographs, and some books are about the process of making photographs.  This book is the best of both: a bunch of great photographs, each with notes about the process and details of how it was made.  The pearls of wisdom in this book cover both technical and social aspects of being a photographer, and it's all told with charm, wit, humor, tenderness, and passion.  I've never met Joe McNally, but after reading this book, I'd give my right arm to have the honor.  Buy this book; you won't regret it.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I've read many reviews for this album, and some of them were downright aggressively angry and bitter.  This is a beguiling album, another chapter in a band that is probably the most underrated, underappreciated band working today.  While grunge exploded in the 1990's and was being thrust in our faces, these guys were making really amazing music completely under the radar, and while the grunge bands have either splintered or are just former fragments of what they used to be, Wilco is still standing, getting better with each album.  I find this album charming, etheral, and solidly Wilcoish.  It's really beautiful, especially the single What Light and Either Way.  Nels Cline's guitar work really gives this album a unique sound.  Jeff Tweedy is a great band leader as well as a great songwriter/musician.  He chooses his musicians with the same great care he writes his songs.  I don't understand why so-called longtime fans of Wilco hate this so much.  It's not Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost is Born, A.M., Mermaid Avenue, Being There, Summerteeth, etc., etc., it's Sky Blue Sky.
0316067598|2.0|I was pretty excited to read this book because I love military stories.  The beginning was very interesting with some great first hand accounts of Navy SEAL training and the BUD/S class.  However, just after the first hundred pages, the author starts to discuss Afghanistan.  In his discussion and even in scenes describing the final battle he blames liberals and the liberal media for everything, including the ultimate deaths that occur.  The author is very upset that he can't shoot everyone he sees on sight because the \\"liberal media\\" would crucify him.  I know the author has some guilt about what happened, specifically not executing some civilians before the final battle, but the blame goes too far.  I didn't make it much more than halfway before I had to stop reading.
B0000A98ZP|2.0|I have to admit I've never been a fan of John Hughes.  He's like an icon to many Gen Xers, not necessarily because they all like his films (many don't), but because he was the quinessential 80's teenage comedy man.  But this film is probably the most overrated one he ever did.  I thought it was good when I first saw it, but it's really tame stuff masquerading as edgy, pointed teen angst.  The concept itself could have been interesting (a day's detention with 5 typical high school types, the nerd, the spoiled queen, the druggie, the jock, and the \\"alternate\\" chick), and it's surprising that Hollywood greenlighted a film with no real plot like this one (Hughes had major pull in those days).  But the execution is really pedestrian.  I especially dislike the ending, in which the alternate chick cleans up and ends up with the jock (never happen), and the druggie and the queen together was even more preposterous.  It's ridiculous.  It completely undermines the entire story of the 5 castes of teenagers.  There are a few choice moments (the man who played the principal was quite funny at times), and some of the dialogue is decent, but overall it will mainly be remembered for a nostlagia trip for 80's kids.
B000XA5K48|3.0|I rented this DVD as an action film in the mold of the \\"Die Hard\\" series or any Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis film.  This is not that type of movie.    Like other reviewers have said, this is an NC-17 non-animated take on Bugs Bunny.  It is more reminiscent of Quentin Taretino's \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\".  You may like this if this is your type of movie.    I really wanted to like this movie as it had three of my favorite actors:  Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Stephen McHattie.  These three actors helped the movie to 3 stars.
1850897301|1.0|The stories are well told on this audiobook; we are a homeschooling family.  Imagine my shock when I was in the next room as my son was listening to this in his room, and I hear the \\"f\\" word, not once, but used repeatedly in one of the stories on disc 6!  I could not believe it.  I do not need audiobooks suggesting this type of language to my son!  I was shocked and replayed it, and there it was, repeatedly.  Be warned.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden announced their breakup in 2000, but their music never left my world. I purchased this CD in 1999, their music is so addictive, their debut album is great, and this one is perfect from begin to end. Affirmation starts the album passionately and I Don't Know You Anymore concludes the CD emotionally. Of course, these are many gems beset in these tracks, I Knew I loved you, Crash and Burn, The Animal Song, The Love after me, Gunning Down romance, and especially, Two beds and a coffee machine, my favourite in this album.  It's really a great loss that they broke up, they are just so good and maybe the best duo in my generation.
0143038419|2.0|This is a readable book and I don't want to give the impression that it isn't.  However, it is one of those non-stories we run into too often.  Written from the author's point of view, she is not a likable character.  She is a frustrating, confused person which, if she did not take herself so seriously and spend her life looking for easy spiritual solutions, she might seem sympathetic.  The only parts of the book I liked, thus two stars instead of one, were her rants on the horrors of divorce and what it means to loose everything when you are the one who created everything.  If you are female, you might like it more.  If you have an over-eating disorder, consider reading it.  If you feel running from your problems is a solution, you will love it.  The last few chapters are actually pretty good, if you make it that far.
B0039LAPWK|5.0|A masterpiece from start to finish. Possibly his best film, but you know that is going to be highly subjective. The Bluray tightens things up about as much as possible in the picture area but what you are coming here for is the audio and my oh my is it nice in uncompressed glory.<br /><br />The acting is great throughout and Lynch is at his most experimental by far. A really great ride if you are in the mood for something totally different. Not to everyone's taste but for what it is this one rocks the cinema. Nothing like it out there.<br /><br />Now release these Lynch films in America for the love of god.

You have to realize where you are, what you want, and be willing to change to bring about a different outcome.  This book explains, in simple terms, how to get started.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I had no problems watching this film. I originally saw it at the cinema, and then again on blu-ray, and each time, I didn't feel sick, or dizzy. The majority of reviews on Amazon are one or two star reviews complaining about the camera, which quite possibly will put people off from seeing the movie. It's a film. It's a bit shaky. Get over it already.<br /><br />Normally, I do get put off by all the hype surrounding movies. All the teaser trailers (the statue of liberty's head lying in the street), the internet buzz, the fact that nothing was really given away before the film was released. Too much hype can ruin a movie in my opinion. But after seeing this at the cinema and on blu-ray, I have to say, I liked it as much second time round, as I did first time.<br /><br />I will agree with some other reviewers that the characters annoyed me. The only character I really liked was Marlena, played by Lizzy Caplan. (If you're thinking she looks very different from Janice Ian in Mean Girls - it's the same girl! And if anyone saw the cancelled second season of Tru Calling, she's in that too.) The rest of the characters irritated me majorly and were mostly unknowns.<br /><br />Some reviewers have compared to this to The Blair Witch Project. I hated Blair Witch project. It only got good in the last 10-15 minutes. What I will say about Cloverfield, is that it keeps your attention right the way through the movie, without failing once. The film is visually stunning, to begin with a leaving party, which is quite rudely interrupted. A couple of the scenes towards the beginning reminded me of scenes from 9/11. The monster was also extremely well done, quite often if you see a monster, all the mystery & intrigue is taken away, but it's only when it's actually caught on camera close up, that you realise all the brief glimpses throughout the movie doesn't do the monster justice. The one brief glimpse will have it burned into your brain forever. Put it this away, it's in the same ranks as the predator, the alien, all the other great movie monsters. Wow what a creature. It's like lots of different parts of other creatures!<br /><br />The first person viewpoint was an interesting concept, not something I thought worked in Blair Witch. You never really get to 'know' Hud that much, as you know the rest of the characters. He's only briefly seen compared to the rest of the characters, as he's always behind the camera. But since he had a bit of a thing for Marlena, it worked in that sense! And there's always shots of feet running, and very fast shots as the camera tries to catch everything that's going on. Put yourself in that position - you're not going to be running from a big scary monster, and stop to make sure the camera was off so you didn't record your feet? Or take your time to record footage on your left, when something more exciting is happening on your right? (For example.)<br /><br />The effects are amazing, and work well in cinema and on blu-ray. The only thing I really didn't like was the 'flashback' scenes. (The other footage on the video camera pretty much.) They were OK, but it just didn't work quite well in my opinion.<br /><br />Cloverfield is over very quickly, it seems, it passes in a breeze. After first watching in the cinema, I was not amused about walking down a dark road in order to get my bus home. Thankfully, I did jump as much as I did in the cinema when I saw the helicopter scene second time around.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend Cloverfield.

I bought it for a 6 year old. The kid was blown away. The only draw backs are the words on some of the pop up areas are to small, placed in areas that can be hard to read and the vocabulary is to difficult  for young child to read. It is great for an aduld to read to a child.

0307275639|2.0|With all due respect to Professor Morrie, I mean no disrespect to his illness or the obvious many lives that he touched deeply.    However, I found the book to lack depth. The writer professes the way he wastes life not loving enough and being positive like the mentor he neglected for years. Sure, this is a problem many people could sympathize with. We all take for granted the things we have until we are about to lose them. The book does not deliver on why we need each other even in the worst of times and only aims to highlight the courage of of his teacher whom he forgot about for so many years. I would have liked a deeper exploration of people in general and why we are so self-involved. I guess this was beyond a writer who has more experience writing about quarterbacks and goalkeepers.     The book is good for hopeless people looking for even a douse of inspiration. That is as far as the writer can take you.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Shortbus is the dream child of writer/director John Cameron Mitchell, who brought us the delightful film, Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Mr. Mitchell wanted his next film to be about sex and sexuality and he had seen foreign films where the actors actually had sex on screen as part of the film, but he had not known of any English-language ones.  He wanted to make the first, and what he has come up with is a delightful essay of a small group of people's sexual problems and their attempts to remedy those problems.    This is a not-rated movie and the viewer immediately finds out why.  The opening shot is of the head of Lady Liberty in New York City with the soundtrack belting out the words, \\"Is you is or is you not my baby?  The way you have been acting leaves me doubt.\\"  As the song goes on the camera sails through the windows of several people's bedrooms while they are engaged in the most intimate of moments.  In the first zoom through a window the audience sees a naked semi-erect man sitting in a bath tub taking film footage of his penis.  Next we zoom through the window of an S&M hooker spraying off her assortment of dildos while being questioned by her john.  Then we zoom back to the first man who is now filming himself trying to perform fellatio on himself.  Next we zoom through the window in an apartment where a man is performing cunnilingus on an oriental woman who is sitting naked on a grand piano and then the couple goes through a wide assortment of gymnastic contortions of sexual intimacy.  Zoom into apartment #4 and you see a good looking man watching the guy in the first apartment filming his oral feat.  Finally all of the scenes end with orgasmic conclusions including our john with the S&M Dominatrix Hooker shooting his load onto a Sydney Pollack-style painting where it strangely seems to fit in.    At first the viewer is shocked, but isn't this really closer to real life than what is typically portrayed?  It seemed refreshingly frank.      It turns out that the man who was trying the acrobatic fellatio, James (Paul Dawson), has a gay lover, Jamie (P J DeBoy).  His lover is very attached to him, but James is pushing away in the relationship, wanting more.  James wants them to try an open relationship.  The oriental lady, Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) with the acrobatic lover on the piano, is a sex therapist who has been faking her orgasms with her lover and actually in fact had never had one in her life.  James and Jamie come to her for sexual relationship advice and through that relationship they find Shortbus, a large home whose owner, Justin Bond, describes the place as, \\"You know school busses.  This is the shortbus.  This is a salon for the gifted and challenged!\\"  It features a wide variety of environments, all equally bizarre, including a sex party room.  There is a cabaret room, a lesbian bar, and a very diverse group of people including the former mayor of New York.  In this environment all of the principle characters introduced in the opening scenes work on their sexual problems.  Sofia hooks up with the S&M Hooker, Seve (Lindsay Beamish).  As the hooker said, \\"I will help you discover how to have an orgasm and you can teach me how to have a real human interaction with someone.\\"  James and Jamie find Seth a handsome man for a three-way romance, and the voyeur even finds a relationship fulfilled.  The film ends in a carnival atmosphere where the Cabaret vocalist is singing, \\"We all get it in the end,\\" to the accompaniment of a marching polka band.  Did I say the environment of Shortbus is a little bizarre?    However, Shortbus is a dramatic story of sexual conflicts and people trying to solve them.  I heartily recommend it.  Actually I was in the hospital the first time I saw the film and it got my heart going again!  Perhaps it will perform miracles for you as well.    Gary Kaufman
B000002UAX|3.0|This was the first album I ever owned that didn't have Batman on the cover or barnyard animals singing on it. My parents bought it for me for Christmas, and I've loved the Beatles ever since. It contains some great songs, and George Harrison's contributions are uncharacteristically strong. But it also contains a lot of crummy music by a band who I think probably just had entirely too much time and money on their hands at the time. This could have easily been one record instead of a double-album, and it would have been better for it.

B000H2FDTO|4.0|Former CIA officer Robert Baer's book \\"See No Evil\\" inspired the film Syriana, about the Middle East, the oil industry and espionage. For people to comment that it is just conspiracy theory is totally ignorant and ridiculous. While the story is fictional, it accurately portrays all sides and why they each belief their actions are just. It does a great job of allowing the viewer to understand every player in the game and empathize with them to an extent. In no way am I condoning terrorism, but we need to understand why young men are willing to blow themselves up. It isn't simply about religion, it is far more complex than that, much of it having to do with blowback from U.S. intervention in their countries to control oil. Many people in this part of the world are suffering and turn to Islamic extremism, even terrorism, in an act of desperation.    One person commented that Canada is our largest supplier of oil, but they failed to mention that Saudi Arabia is a close second. Without their oil our economy would collapse because Canada can't possibly provide enough oil to meet our demands. Also not mentioned is that the world has reached peak oil production and oil reserves in the American continents, as well as Europe, and Africa are going to dry up by 2025. After that the only place left on  earth that will have oil reserves is Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and a few other Middle Eastern countries.     Saudi Arabia has the largest oil reserves of any country in the world. They have 25% of the world's reserves which dwarfs that of any other country. Thus they will be the last to have it, which makes them very important and powerful. Quite possibly to our detriment unless we wean ourselves off of it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Everyone keeps saying how this is a family-oriented series, but I disagree.  For adults, I agree with what everyone else has said about the series, and there's not much more I can add.    However, with those who have sensitive children (by that, I mean children who don't like to see other animals killed), I don't think this is the family-oriented show as some have said.  Every 10 minutes, there is one animal chasing another, either biting it to the point where you know what comes next, or being carried off to be eaten.  Although I agree this is a part of nature, judging from how my 9-year old sister seems to be acting after watching 2 episodes, I don't think this series is for them.    Great video, great documentary, but not for kids who aren't ready for the animal-preditor aspect of it.
0307346617|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this book. Even though I'm not keen on the topic, every single account of the war (oral history style) was a magnificent and horrific testament to the human condition.     Everyone needs to read this book before they die
B000ZK4466|4.0|I wish I could say more, but if you are a fan of the original [[ASIN:B00009V7T2 De-Loused in the Comatorium]]raw sound and style, this album is for you. I never really got into [[ASIN:B0007GAEW6 Frances the Mute]]or [[ASIN:B000GPI1BO Amputechture]]as much but this is a classic in the At the Drive-In sense of their experimental sound.     I love it.

0440238609|5.0|I have been so happy with my purchase of these three books at such a great price. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels to purchase this boxed set, especially when the three books bought together are cheaper than buying just one at the bookstore.   I haven't been able to put a book down since beginning the novels and can't wait to read them over again.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I cannot even remember the last time my wife, my 12-year-old son, 10-year old daughter and I all agreed that we liked a movie.<br /><br />We all agreed that STARDUST is a wonderful movie. Humor, action, adventure, magic ... a wonderful cast of characters ... STARDUST has it all.<br /><br />After watching the previews, I was a bit concerned that the witches might be a bit too scary for my daughter (she didn't like MONSTER HOUSE). No worries though ... not too scary at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0385292244|3.0|No two ways about it, this book has its winning qualities, and it sucked me right in.  I'll share the pros first (briefly), then the cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Brilliant story (despite soap opera moments).  Clavell pulled together a complex marvel of a book.<br /><br />2) Gripping intro to feudal Japan (despite historical inaccuracies)<br /><br />3) Amazing breadth and detail, on so many levels<br /><br />4) Powerful characterizations<br /><br />Now the cons:<br /><br />Clavell got seduced by the extreme sickness of feudal Japan, and in turn seduces the reader.  Feudal Japan is civilized?  Hardly.  I'm not just talking about the obvious brutality - mass murder, child murder, sex with children, sex slavery - but the more subtle levels of psychological illness.  Clavell idealizes a traumatized culture and people, mistaking their emotional dissociation (which is only a symptom of trauma) for enlightenment.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to describe this is by noting Clavell's idealization of suicide (which happens on nearly every other page).  Suicide is the ultimate sign of hopelessness in life's value, and when the main character makes his suicide attempt Clavell paints it as a key moment in his process of emotional maturity.  Sorry, no!<br /><br />Clavell also idealizes his characters' sex addictions and alcoholism.  No surprise there was so much sex addiction and drinking:  traumatized people with no hope of healing need to act out somehow!<br /><br />My main question:  Why would Clavell be so seduced by this disturbed concept of reality and \\"civilization\\"?<br /><br />My best guess:  He has some form of Stockholm syndrome.  His bio states he was a three-year prisoner-of-war in a brutal, death-ridden, Japanese-controlled jail during WWII.  Although you'd think Clavell would hate the Japanese for this - and part of him probably did - I suspect his survival (emotional and perhaps physical) depended on loving his captors (who represent the brutal sides of his own parents from childhood), and that he wrote this idealized love story as a defense against the rage and pain and grief of his own unresolved traumas.nse against the rage and pain and grief of his own unresolved traumas.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Very good video!  My daughter loves it!  It's not just because it's the Little Mermaid, but it is a very well-made video.  I will say that it could be a little scary for 3 and under because of the sea witch and stuff.  A couple of the scenes are scary but don't last long.   However, if that type of thing doesn't bother your child it will be fine.
B000YENUI6|5.0|This is one of my two favorite films of 2007 (tied with \\"Into the Wild\\") and offers exceptional performances, especially by multi-award-nominated Viggo Mortensen.  Cronenberg skillfully uses the brutal violence to tell the story, but without being gratuitious.  It's fast paced, compelling, emotional and will surely stay with you long after the closing credits.<br /><br />The special features are minimal, but it's still a must-own for modern film collectors and fans.
B000VJ271A|5.0|The set resembles the interior of Wright's Guggenheim squished down.  Choristers populate a spiraling balustrade.  Dancers predominate in the parterre.  In no scene does the set evoke the nominal setting.  Nothing about it even looks French.  But the costumes are colorful, the crowd baletic, the photography expert.  The performance is excellent.  Dessay is an athletic Manon, very engaged physically and vocally.  She is well matched by Villazon at his most serious.  The louche brother is vividly performed by Manuel Lanza.  The count is Samuel Ramey, in less firm but still convincing voice, looking impeccably fit.

Its much better than season 1 & 2 (MUST     OWN),its worth every dollar i spent. And the season finale when i first     watch it i was like what the hell!!!best episode ever    Cant wait for season 4
B00001OH7O|5.0|I listen to this album almost every day.  I will burn out on it in a while and rotate to Ziggy Stardust.  David Bowie is a genius.  The program director of my university radio station and I discussed creating an all David Bowie station in the 80's.  I only wish he hadn't replaced his English teeth with California chicklets.  His teeth gave him his special handsome look.  He looks great now but I miss his real teeth!
0780626494|4.0|I owned this in the VHS format, and was thrilled to purchase it when it came out on DVD.  It is among my favorites, I watch it over and over.  I like movies without tons of foul language, and obvious sex.  It is cute and simple, and leaves you with a good feeling - something that too many movies today don't do.  If you are looking for an elaborate plot, lots of bells and whistles, this one is not for you. It is more of a chick flick, than a guys film.
0521675804|5.0|English is not my native language and I know very well how difficult is to learn a second language without proper education. I have studied Murphy's books for a long time and recommend his books for everybody. There are a lot of good books out there (I have purchased a whole bunch of them!), but no one bits this one. This book is for elementary students. There are also the intermediate grammar and the advanced grammar - all them are great! It is a must have! Buy with confidence!
B0011NVC9I|2.0|Director Robert Zemekis, who brought you the spectacular The Polar Express, now brings you the thousand-year-old vicious Viking story Beowulf. Unfortunately its' strikingly, vivid visuals are almost too stunning and magnificent for its' own good.<br /><br />I am sure many of you were forced to read the graphic story in a high school English class, and even though I am told it departs from the story so much, I will not go into great detail about the plot. It's main premise is a demon Grendel is terrorizing a village and the King calls for a hero to kill it, offering half the gold in his kingdom. Enter Beowulf who comes from afar to the rescue, but gets sidetracked by Grendel's mother. How could you not get sidetracked by a digitally-manipulated nude Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />I was so sad after watching this because I really wanted to like it. There were several things that made this so awful. The script was so horribly dry and dull that it took the life out of the characters. Also I felt that the animators spent so much time and effort on the close-ups of the actor's face (primarily Beowulf's), but not enough on their movement and action. The moment the characters would make any movement I felt like I was watching a glorified computer game, and I almost expected to see a digital scoreboard appear.<br /><br />Now some of the good points: The cast is a first rate ensemble including Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Ray Winstoned, and Brenan Gleeson. The other point that made this film tolerable was the fact that you have never seen anything like this before one screen. The animation is so original that for a while you will be simply delighted just to watch just for the visual grandeur, but that fades off rather quickly. This actually causes the downfall as you are so enthralled by the animation that you loose sight of the story and characters. It almost seemed like the filmmakers were so excited with their new technology that they got lost in the animation forgetting the story, script, and characters.<br /><br />After I watched Beowulf I thought about the amount of time and money ($150 million) they spent producing it, and I felt it would have been so much better if they had simply shot it real life and made it into an exciting blockbuster adventure rather than a two hour, computer game look-alike animated epic.imation forgetting the story, script, and characters.

B0010V4TZU|1.0|Seriously the most overrated cd I've heard in years.  This is about as gutless as rock gets.  I had it on shuffle play for a good week with the Whigs, Drive By Truckers, Feist and M.I.A. (to give you an example of what else I'm listening to...Replacements are my all time favorite band, Archers of Loaf would be second, so you know where I'm coming from), and seriously the chick in Feist could kick the butts of everyone in Vampire Weekend with one arm tied behind her back.  Tired songs, embarassing lyrics (no, really...EMBARASSING), hideously annoying keyboards, and the worst use of violins this side of a Celine Dion record.  THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL.  And really, when I think of great pop (Nick Lowe's JESUS OF COOL), it doesn't even have the guts to compare.  (It's like bad music that would be playing at a children's party that makes you want to kill yourself.)  Really...buy the first CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, or the new STEVE EARLE, or if you really need to spend money pick up a copy of IN THE AREOPLANE OVER THE SEA (if you don't have it)...just please do yourself a favor and avoid falling into the \\"hipster-lemming\\" trap by avoiding this.<br /><br />Post script, written after their SNL appearance: again, trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they \\"bring it\\" live.  They don't.  In fact, it only solidified the argument that there's no substance here, whatsoever.<br /><br />One other thing...to those comparing this to Paul Simon's miraculous GRACELAND.  Are you out of your mind?  Have you heard GRACELAND?  This cd is nothing like GRACELAND in any way shape or form.  Not to mention the silence been the tracks on that historic album has more musical complexity and originality than the best tunes on this cd.  And I don't mean it's not like comparing apples to oranges, it's like comparing apples to week-old dog poop.  To anyone out there considering this disc, DO NOT BUY IT THINKING IT'S LIKE GRACELAND...you will be horribly disappointed.
B000XA5K48|3.0|This movie wastes no time letting you think about plots or characters or any of that `Structure' that many movies drag out for 10 or fifteen minutes in order to establish character or some other thing they might teach you in film schools.  Nope, this one goes right for the throat.      From the moment Clive Owen plunges a carrot into a bad guys eye and kills him (and this happens within the first five minutes) you know this movie is going to require a major suspension of disbelief.  But with that out of the way, you can enjoy the most outrageous action movie ever put on film.  Owen plays a homeless former Black Ops soldier who just stumbles on an assassination conspiracy dealing with small children being born for the use of their blood and bone marrow.  I won't bore with the details but it does get complicated.  In short, he's on the run with a baby in his hands.  Obviously this guy has a conscious and a temper.     Paul Giamatti plays the hitman who's trying to see the job through to the end until his men start getting killed off by this stranger who seems to be able to kill everyone who tries to kill him.  Owen then tries to pawn off the baby on Hooker/Wet Nurse played by the ever-beautiful Italian Actress Monica Bellucci.  The two end up running together, saving the baby and beating the bad guys.      Now, you probably figured this might just be an over the top (yeah, it's way over the top) action flick.  But an obvious statement starts to form as the movie goes on.  Owen's character is the victim of loosing his wife and child to some gunman who walked into a restaurant one day and just started blowing people away.  He later finds out he is indirectly responsible.  His character is the son of an English gunsmith who moved to the US when The British got strict with their gun laws.  He grew up with guns, was a very good marksman and was then recruited by the US Army.      Worse yet, the democratic Senator who is running for President has a major gun control bill inthe works.  The bad guys seem to be a representation of the NRA and the good guy doesn't carry a gun...he just uses whatever is in reach most of the time.  Now, I might be going out on a limb but it seems the movie turns into a big anti-gun statement.  Am I wrong?  Possibly, you'll have to watch for yourself and see.    The movie is definitely entertaining and very funny at times.  All three major actors do a great job, especially Giamantti and Owen.  There really isn't enough seen of Bellucci, especially during a love making/shoot out scene (so outrageous) but could there ever be enough of her?

This was definitely better than 1 star as some have suggested. Something obviously rubbed them the wrong way. Its a movie people, for entertainment - I don't think anyone gets to go in and out of hell several times like in Constantine.

0316067598|5.0|This book should be required reading for ALL politicans, pundits, war commentators and anyone offering comments on war for any reason, for or against.  Conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, Independent... it makes NO difference.  This book is not pro-Bush or anti-Bush, it is not pro-war or anti-war.  It is about reality.    There is a statement made in this book about the process of whether a country should choose to engage in a war.   It is a simple statement.  However, unless the statement (question) is asked we will perpetually relive Korea, Vietnam and Iraq/Afganistan.   The book lays out a real-world example of todays military, todays politics and todays media, not 1940's era or 1918 era. Today.  It is, quite possibly, the only book in print to accurately lay out this reality.       When you get to the section about the 3 goat herders you will face that reality and ask yourself \\"what would I do\\".   And if you can't answer that question honestly, and know how it relates to whether you should be \\"there\\" (at war) or not, then you have done yourself a disservice.     The book is not a cheap thriller.  It is not Steinbeck.  It is not fiction. However, it is well written, very engaging with a dose of the real world that you will not soon forget.      If I had a way to send a copy of this to every politician, media and citizen of the U.S. I would do it.       Remember the goat herders.
B00007MB4I|5.0|The songs on here are all very unique and different than most anything else I've heard. The SACD version is quite a good recording and gives a big soundstage, like their performing right in front of you. Its not really something for everyday listening, but is nice to listen to every now and then.
0142000655|5.0|When I bought this book, Steinbeck could not have been further off my radar. I suppose I expected a solid, picaresque novel that was good in a musty \\"literature\\" sort of way. I could not have been more wrong. I don't think that I have ever been punched in the gut more times by a work of art.  The mixture of mythology and gritty realism never felt forced, in fact it made the story even more fluid and vicious. It is a wonderfully sad, dark, violent and oddly hopeful chronical of human frailty, loyalty and weakness.  It is one of the supreme achievements of the art (all forms, not just literary) of the 20th century. After I read this, I bought everything by Steinbeck that I could get my hands on and buried myself in eleven more of his works before coming up for air.
B0009MAO46|5.0|how can you not LOVE toy story?  everything about this movie is so good....the animation, the story, the voices.....all fit together perfectly.  in a time where CG movies are the norm, Pixar still rises heads and shoulders above everyone else.  i recently watched it in spanish, and even though i couldnt understand everything, i still laughed my butt off at certain scenes.      the story itself.....about toys having a life of their own, goes perfectly with the animation.  the bond that is formed between woody and buzz reminds me alot of some of the friendships i had growing up.      i would not only recommend this to any child i saw on the street, but also any fun loving adult.  also check out toy story 2, and the upcoming (hopefully) toy story 3 from pixar.

006091307X|4.0|Funny & confusing, but due to its length, a great introduction to Pynchon. Even though you find it hard to know what's going on, you don't have to wade through hundreds of pages for the finish.<br /><br />The comparison with Ulysses is not, in my opinion, very apt. While Pynchon had obviously read it, he didn't try to write Ulysses Lite.<br /><br />Enjoyably convoluted and worth the effort.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The Kingom of Heaven (4-Disc Director's Cut) touches on a pivotal period of time in the middle east detailing when the Crusaders lost Jerusalem.  I am giving this movie 5 stars based on the photography, the music and the story line.  I think this movie rates as one of the more entertaining era movies.  The movie appears to tell a story in order to make a point, instead of following history exactly.  The time period of the movie takes place just prior to the third crusade.  The third crusade is seen by some as a romantic period.  This movie shows to some extent how cruel and unromantic the crusades were.  A majority of the characters in the movie are based on real people, though the story lines they follow weave in and out of their actual history.  Balain, played by Orlando Bloom, is based on an actual character.  Balain was not born in France.  His story in the movie shows how someone could feasibly end up as a crusader.  The Pope led the people to believe that if someone participated in the crusades all of their sins would be forgiven.  Crusaders were also authorized to rape and pillage, provided the victims weren't Christians.  This resulted in bringing a number of people of unhonorable character to participate in the crusades.  I think the story line of the movie did a good job at pointing out how dishonorable the crusaders were.  The movie could have gone further to show the cruelty of the Crusaders.  A story following the fall of Jerusalem or the third crusade would have been better to point this out.  The directors cut adds more to the story including the boy king.  The boy king's demise is based somewhat on fact.  The boy is said to have been sickly and conspiracy theories exist as to how he died.  The movie follows the last few years of the Crusader occupation of Jerusalem.  It shows the larger events that led to Saladin's attack that retook Jerusalem for the Muslims.   It shows Saladin in a fair light.  After researching this time era in history it is clearthat Saladin was a man of honor.  Though the ending of this movie is not 100% accurate.  Saladin offered to let everyone out of Jerusalem for a ransom.  Saladin even used some of his own money to buy the freedom of some of the residents of Jerusalem.  In the end not all were freed and some of the Jerusalem residents went into slavery.  The movie was filmed well and is picturesque.  The costumes used are good, though others have pointed out that not all costumes are accurate to the time period.  There is plenty of action, in all portions of the movie.  The story line is good, but it is obvious the story is used to make a point.  The sound track is above average. The director's cut is not rated.  The film contains graphic violence mainly in the battles.  Swords are used to sever limbs and heads.  The movie contains some adult situations, but is tasteful and avoids nudity.  The movie is entertaining and one of a few movies that cover this time period.  It is well worth the time spent to watch it.
B00122O34O|5.0|This soundtrack did the same thing that Garden State's did for it. It fits the movie. It flows. You love it. You burn it onto your computer at work, at home, your friends place, your own ipod/mp3 device, and burn an extra hard copy \\"just in case\\".
B000ZLFALI|4.0|The trend of opera-izing pop music was taken to visual heights in this motion picture.  Set in the late 60's to the songs of the Fab Four from Liverpool, it tells a simple love story (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again) behind the backdrop of the most disturbing time in American history.  Since I was in college during that era, I recall the war protests on campus, the fear for our brothers and boyfriends in Viet Nam, and the civil rights movement.    The music of the Beatles fits in perfectly because it appeared at the same time the youth of America started tuning in, turning on, and dropping out.  Rumor has it the Beatles were introduced to certain chemical substances by Dylan.  The young people of this country had new heroes to worship and they followed their lead.  It wasn't just their haircut we copied.  The Beatles went to India to find peace.  The youth of America looked to the east as well.  It was an unsettling time.  We were living with riots in the streets and our young men dying overseas and the Beatles were living the high life telling us \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Let It Be.\\"    The acting in this film is excellent.  The visual effects are stunning.  The script is weak, but the script is not the story.  Most important, it's realistic in showing someone who isn't happy about being drafted, but he shows up for induction anyway; and it also shows how those protesting the Viet Nam war eventually resort to violence themselves.    I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't like the Prudence character and she didn't add anything to the film.  Walking along a football field singing \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" was the low point for me.  They only used her to get a couple of Beatle tunes in, I guess.    Some have criticized this movie for misuse of the Beatles' songs.  I think they've missed the whole point.  The Beatles themselves didn't always know what they were writing about and the director of this film actually improved on some of the work.  If you think about it or know much about music, a lot of the Beatles' stuff isn't very good.  Even though I screamed in front of the TV when they were on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964, listening to the Beatles over and over again has never been my favorite pasttime.  But, I'll be watching this movie a lot.
B00006FDCD|5.0|The first thing I said when I watched this movie was \\"Hey, Seth Green is in here!\\" Well actully I saw it awhile back but didnt notice Green was in this movie, probably because he wasnt a star then. Anywho, this is a great movie. The special effects are top notch, the cast is made up of all stars, and Tim Curry puts on a chilling performance as the killer clown. This movie does not have gore but it still delivers on the chills. It sort of reminds me of anther King novel turned movie, Stand by Me. Instead of friends looking for a dead body, they are fighting an evil clown that kills children. I do admit the movie is long and there are so cheesy moments, but I still enjoyed this film. I wonder if they had made this movie for theaters, if it would have had more gore. Highly recommend this movie anyways.
0385335482|5.0|This book was very interesting. It was fun to read and the book was written very well. I would suggest if you are going to start this series of books to start with Confession of a Shopaholic. I would highly suggest this book.
B0001WTVUW|1.0|This movie was essentially left-wing propaganda ... nothing more.  I thought it would be more entertaining, but it was more fantasy than fiction.    Only the blast scenes were worth watching ...  I bought this movie and became so grossly bored watching it that I still haven't finished it a year and a half later.  Don't know if I ever will be interested enough to?

B000R7HY0K|3.0|As an avid fan of Tarantino's other movies I expected a lot more from this one. There are a couple of things which kill the movie, the first of which is that it didn't really need to be divided into two parts. The cast, scenery, dialog, and setup are all much better in the first half of the movie than in the second part. By letting the movie conclude with the first cast having thier revenge (yes, some re-writing) rather than breaking off and re-starting with a fresh cast it would have been a better movie, as well as a bit shorter. Instead, the movie is 30 minutes too long and there are no interesting people on the screen except for Rosario Dawson for most of that time. And there's a ton of dialog between two pretty dull actresses. Three stars is charitable; a great soundtrack helps.

Excellent product must have for all Shakira fans and all the people who likes hi def picture.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|An amazing work of musical and lyrical creativity! I first saw RA at Warped Tour in 06 (what a show!) and as soon as I got home I went out and bought The Sufferer & The Witness. I haven't stopped listening to the CD since I bought it 2 years ago. It was one of the best punk albums I have ever heard. Ever. Every song on the The Sufferer & The Witness blows me away. With tearing guitars and unimaginably deep lyrics, Rise Against has truly honed their art of music making. Get this CD! You will be impressed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This has to be the best DVD mini-series on WWII.  It was very well put together and enjoyable to watch.  I like to watch programs on WWII on the History Channel and this is one of my favorites.  If you like this box set, you will also enjoy \\"The War\\" by Ken Burns.  It is a WWII documentary you should not miss.
1401300529|5.0|First off, let me say that I don't often read military histories, but was drawn to this one by an interest in Korea and by Halberstam's reputation as a writer. So it was with some surprise that I found myself completely absorbed by his account of the Korean War. When my father died a few years ago, I discovered among his things a document indicating that he had stayed in the Army, as a member of the reserves, after his service in World War II. In 1950, as the war got underway, an officer friend advised him to \\"get out\\" (my dad had a wife and a child by this time) and he did. As I read Halberstam's book, I could only think that my young father might easily have perished in those terrible years, too. There are several themes in this account of the war that I found interesting. The first is the towering arrogance of General MacArthur, not only towards Truman, his commander-in-chief, but towards his colleagues in the Army, as well. The second is the pervasive racism that caused MacArthur and his staff to often fatally underestimate their adversaries, the Chinese, as \\"laundrymen.\\" I was also struck by Halberstam's devastating critique of Charles Willoughby and his doctoring of intelligence to fit the requirements of MacArthur's plans. Hmm, this sounds familiar. Finally, I learned a lot about how political pressures shape what happens on the battlefield. Read this book; it will make you think about things that are happening today, in Iraq. And don't be put off by readers who complain that the book is not a comprehensive history of the Korean War. It does not pretend to be that--as the title clearly indicates. One of the best things about this book is the interviews it contains with ordinary soldiers, whose war, along with their roles in it, has mostly been forgotten. Halberstam's recounting of these stories is peerless.

B000RE619I|5.0|and downloaded the track, Fading which I will review at the very end.<br /><br />NEVER AGAIN . . . A great mid-tempo that's angrier than ANY of Kelly's previously released songs. Her first single. 8/10<br /><br />ONE MINUTE . . . A great up and down track about a lover who is so f'd up emotionally. \\"One minute you laugh,\\" Kelly confesses. \\"...then next minute you're slowly, sinking, into, something black!\\" A bit better than NEVER AGAIN. 8.5/10<br /><br />HOLE . . . Previously my favorite track by her ever! Now that SOBER owns that title, I must say that this great mid-tempo is still THE hardest track (rock-wise) that she's ever managed. Powerful vocal, emotionally delivered. :) 10/10<br /><br />SOBER . . . Very inspiring yet kind of sad all in one. It's dramatic ending builds and then soars. One of her most powerfully-written tracks. Love ya, Kells. ^_^ 11/10<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME . . . Didn't care for it much until it became a single (her official 3rd single, second video). After that, and not cause of the video, I was listening to it a bit more and gave it an actual chance and like it now. Some friends just never \\"hear\\" you. 8.25/10<br /><br />JUDAS . . . Another track I didn't originally like much. I did care for the lyrics but Kelly just seemed to scream and scream. I get it now. :) 8/10<br /><br />HAUNTED . . . Everyone likes to compare this with Breakaway's Addicted. I still see next to no connection and previously, like the two other tracks mentioned beforehand, didn't like this one much either. Couldn't relate too much and it just wasn't my cup of tea so I would more or less skip them all in a row! Now, Haunted is in the top 3 best vocally-delivered tracks and has great emotions, demonstrated vocally. 9/10<br /><br />BE STILL . . . Great ballad that I loved from the get go. Still one of the better tracks on MD and will remain to be. Super-relate-able and a slow jam. 10/10<br /><br />MAYBE . . . Great lyrics and yet again, very real. Another mid-tempo which seems to plague her CD (not in a bad way, mind you). Very honest here and lovely. Third best mid-tempo here (HOLE and SOBER are superior). 10/10<br /><br />HOW I FEEL . . . Nice quick guitar riffs. Funny but sad. It's about being single, trying to find someone, but falling flat because every guy you run into is tied to another. Yet again. \\"Babies; everywhere I look. Trophy wives; with their little black books.\\" An obvious favorite. 9/10<br /><br />YEAH . . . Kinda funky. It's different and Kelly makes it her own. Also, previously my favorite track (every song seems to switch up once in a while) but has been taken by HOLE and SOBER. 9/10<br /><br />CAN I HAVE A KISS . . . Even though it's not a single this gets played where I work, which I'm guessing is on some satellite radio. Could be mistaken. Either way, it's another mid-tempo (surprised?) that shines, showing Kelly's desperation for affection. \\"I tried to warn you, been a mess since you've known me, I can't promise forever, but I'm working on it; If I can't hold you, can I have a kiss?\\" 9/10<br /><br />IRVINE . . . To say that this ballad is not only heartbreaking but heart-wrenching would be an understatement. Everyone seems to cling to this song and it's for great reason. It's so sad, and shows how low Kelly was on tour in Irvine. \\"I don't have long, before I fade completely.\\" she slowly croons. It's sweetly-delivered but has brought out many tears I'm sure. Novelty runs a bit thin after you hear it 30x though. 10/10<br /><br />CHIVAS . . . It's actually a part of IRVINE, 1-2 minutes after it goes off unless you own the Japanese version of MD or another that may have it split. The Japanese version is the only one I know of that has them split. But CHIVAS is kinda funny. It's a kiss off too. Not the best that I've heard but still good. \\"It wasn't even good, trust me. I must've been so so so so...lonely.\\" She admits. It took me forever to hear this because I didn't own the album until a few days afterthe album came out and I bought it. Still not disappointed in that decision. No doubt that Kelly's CDs will continue to be a part of my collection. 8.25/10<br /><br />FADING . . . Should've made it to the U.S. release. JUDAS is decent but it basically repeats what DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME already catchily delivers. So in a sense, JUDAS could've been left off, and FADING, added right before HAUNTED cause it would have fit greatly! But now that I have heard this, I love it. If she's talking about herself then this song gets more points from me! \\"Amongst these faceless others, underneath the surface, everything's so backwards, it's all a lie\\". 9.25 + .5 = 9.75/10<br /><br />All in all some of it really had to grow on me. I heard NEVER AGAIN when I saw the video. It seemed slightly darker and much more angry than the light stuff on Breakaway was. But it didn't necessarily catch my attention then. I downloaded the songs (minus CHIVAS) online and I found that I loved some of the other tracks and that's when NEVER AGAIN started to shine.<br /><br />137.75 ÷ 15 = 9.183333333333<br /><br />9.18 = 4.59<br /><br />4.59 stars.<br /><br />If you're angry or sad AND that type of music helps you heal then let it grow on you. Most of it should. Some think it was rushed or just shouldn't have been released at all! I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion, but their opinion IN MY OPINION is wrong, and sorely mistaken at best!<br /><br />Rock on, Kelly. Nice to see her get a bit harder musically. One of the best pop stars of the new ages.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm now next to positive that FADING is of her friend who so sadly killed herself...4/7/08: Kelly admits on a youtube video that Irvine was written about how she felt while touring in Irvine. She also says that she only delves so deep, and the rest is a secret. Probably too painful.inue to be a part of my collection. 8.25/10    FADING . . . Should've made it to the U.S. release.

0321525655|5.0|I have been reading Garr's blog for about a year and was delighted when he announced that he was writing Presentation Zen. When the book arrived, I determined to read it slowly, soak up the ideas, and savor having all that information at my fingertips. (I love the web, but I love my books, too.) Garr has taken when he knows and presented it in a logical format, on pages that practice what he preaches, while providing solid chunks of useful information for anyone who makes presentations.    And that's the heart of this book - it is for anyone who wants to better their presentation style. I am a teacher and make much use of an interactive white board. Teachers are, by nature, presenters. This book is as much for us as it is for those who make a living as professional speakers and slide makers. Teachers use bulletin boards, interactive white boards, and handouts, as well as slide shows and other media, all as a means of informing and presenting. We aim to reach a diverse set of learners. Heavens only knows there are a lot of us who could benefit by improving our presentation and slide/handout skills so that our students are not lost in a maze of jibberish on the page, screen or in what we say.    I intend to incorporate many of Garr's suggestions as I teach faculty how to use interactive white boards, because it isn't just the content, it's also very much how the content is presented that impacts our students.    And I'm waiting for his next book!
0385751532|5.0|I've read many books that fall into the \\"Holocaust literature\\" category. This one may actually be a book that is written in a style that COULD be read by a child but should be read by adults. Whether it is suitable for children depends on how sensitive your child is- and how well you think he or she could handle some very graphic details. They aren't \\"graphic\\" in the sense of being spelled out in detail but the reader's imagination can fill in the blanks. At age 9, this book would have been far too intense for me - and the main character in this one, Bruno, is age 9.<br /><br />The author used a technique which was brilliant, taking readers into the mind and thoughts of a child whose father work for the \\"Fury\\" (the Fuhrer) and who is sent to live in Out-With (Auschwitz), on the safe side of the fence, in an actual home.<br /><br />  The novel is labeled \\"a fable\\" and I think this was a wise choice by both author and publisher. After all, no one knows exactly how a 9 year old son of a German officer would think and young Bruno seems remarkably naive sometimes. But just as light sets off shadows more vividly, I think his exaggerated innocence allows readers to experience the horrors of Auschwitz that much more. For that reason, I don't think the accuracy of Bruno's character is all that important. The effect on the reader (THIS reader, anyway) is profound and deep.<br /><br />  After moving to Out-With (Auschitz) Bruno meets a boy \\"on the other side of the fence\\", one who is the same age, a lad named Schmuel. At first Bruno is envious of the boy who gets to wear striped pajamas all day and who seems to have lots of companions.<br /><br />On Bruno's side there are few playmates and he doesn't realize that he has so much compared to Schmuel. There is a sudden twist in this tale and I can't write about that. I will say it is the one reason adults should read this book before sharing it with children.<br /><br />  The book isn't quite like any other of this type I've read, not even The Diary of Anne Frank. Each chapter has a simple headline (Bruno Makes a Discovery, Bruno Tells a Perfectly Reasonable Lie) that reads like something a child could write. So do the words of each chapter and I think the child's voice should speak to both the child and adult residing in readers. It certainly did for me!<br /><br />  You'll be haunted by this one. If you get the edition with a Reading Guide included, you will find all sorts of extra features, includng an interview with the author, John Boyne.ach chapter has a simple headline (Bruno Makes a Discovery, Bruno Tells a Perfectly Reasonable Lie) that reads like something a child could write.

B000XO2R1S|3.0|This is a mishmash, with some great talent and some great songs but the songs are not always the kinds of standards that are great for making \\"interpretations\\" and the talent is sometimes bent to homogeneity in the name of compromise (I guess). Also note that the amazon \\"album\\" has 10 cuts and the itunes \\"album\\" has 12, the other two being long and good Hancock cuts worth having. Listen to the samples before you plunge. And find real Joni and undiluted Hancock elsewhere, if that's your taste. It sure is mine.
B000002B7O|5.0|While not quite the heavy-metal monument that Blizzard Of Ozz is, Dairy Of A Madman (1981) is a great album that includes some great songs, and several of them are Ozzy's best. Flying High Again, Believer, You Can't Kill Rock And Roll, and Dairy Of A Madman are all top of the line Ozzy, some of the best work he's ever done. Drugs and insanity are major themes on the album, and Flying High Again is Ozzy's anthem to chemical exploration.<br /><br />I can see through mountains, watch me disappear<br />I can even touch the sky<br />Swallowing the colors of the sound I hear<br />Or am I just a crazy guy (you bet)<br /><br />Over The Mountain, Little Dolls, Tonight, and S.A.T.O. are all good songs, too, and they make up the rest of the album, so there really isn't anything to complain about here. This is Ozzy is at the peak of his career as a singer, and with Randy Rhoads providing the electric guitar fireworks, you can bet this one's a winner. Of the two Osbourne/Rhoads collaborations, Dairy is possibly a little more decadent, and sometimes a little more atmospheric (Believer, Dairy Of A Madman) than Blizzard, but Blizzard is probably more consistent. Either way, both are essential Ozzy, and both belong in any heavy-metal music collection.<br /><br />*Beware of the newer 2002 re-issue of Dairy Of A Madman: Different bass and drum tracks have been dubbed in over the original recording.

B000EGEVZK|5.0|This the most incredible DVD on the Ramones in along time.  It was truly fabulous to see the concerts and footage all over again.  It was just like being there live in their early years.  This is a must for all Ramones fans.
B00000IMTF|4.0|One of my all time favorite live albums is Rainbow's late 70's opus \\"On Stage\\".  It was the album that introduced me to vocalist Ronnie James Dio who in my opinion is one of the great rock vocalists of all time.  By this time the band was really an all star project with Richie Blackmore (Deep Purple, Blackmore's Night), Cozy Powell (Black Sabbath, ELP, Brian May many others), Tony Carey (Planet P) and Jimmy Bain (Ozzy).  The band changed lineups over it's years as a performing entity, but the lineup on this album  remains what most people consider to be the classic band.  I own several Rainbow discs on vinyl, but this is the only one that I have on CD.  I think that this is their best studio album.  There are only 6 tracks on the disc, and 5 of them are classics.  The only one that does not really work for me is \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" which does not really seem to fit with the rest of the album.  The other 5 tracks, \\"Tarot Woman\\", \\"Run With The Wolf\\", \\"Starstruck\\", \\"Stargazer\\" and the rocking finale \\"A Light In The Black\\" are all great.  There is plenty of meaty guitar work from Richie Blackmore and Tony Cary throws in some great keyboard solos as well.  Of course Dio soars over the top of all of this with his incredible set of pipes. If you like 70's hard rock with a bit of progressive rock influence this album is a recommended purchase.
B000002VCB|4.0|\\"Eve\\", originally released in 1979, was The Alan Parsons Project's (APP)4th album.  It didn't earn the same acclaim as, say, \\"I Robot\\", but \\"Eve\\", in my opinion, offers a nice selection of solid APP music.  The main theme of this album focuses on, sadly, a rather negative view of women.<br /><br />There is something for most every APP fan on this album.<br /><br />There are two instrumentals:<br />- Lucifer - 3/5 stars...very repetitive, but not bad for background music<br />- Secret Garden - 5/5...good APP instrumental!<br /><br />There are also some harder driving tracks:<br />- You Lie Down With Dogs - 3/5<br />- I'd Rather Be a Man - 3/5<br />- Damned If I Do - 4/5<br /><br />Some mellow tracks:<br />- You Won't Be There - 5/5<br />- If I Could Change Your Mind - 5/5<br /><br />And some pop-tracks:<br />- Winding Me Up - 4/5<br />- Don't Hold Back - 5/5<br /><br />While \\"Eve\\" probably won't ever be know as a Hallmark APP disc, it is, in my opinion, still a good one!  After all, how many discs out there are truly 5-stars through and through?<br /><br />I give this disc 4 stars overall, knowing that, at least for me, it has a mixture of 3/5 to 5/5 star offerings.  And, I think that the whole disc makes for pretty impressive background music.<br /><br />4 stars!  This disc is a definite must-have for dedicated APP fans, but if this is your first foray into APP music, try \\"I Robot\\", \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" or \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" for a taste of what's best about APP.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Michael Mann's previous films \\"Heat\\" and \\"Collateral\\" are two masterpieces of the crime genre. Knowing his considerable skill at telling a stylish and gritty story in this genre there were a lot of high hopes for \\"Miami Vice\\". When I initially saw the film in theaters I was pretty disappointed.  Mann's dialogue was kinda embarrassing and amateurish and the other parts of it were what he calls \\"shop talk\\" between the cops and the crooks. If you aren't as well versed in it as he is you often don't follow because you don't know what's being said. That is one of Manns' gifts as a director is that he knows this world of crime better than anyone which enables him to make these films as realistic as possible. Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are in a club trying to entrap a pimp when Crockett gets an urgent phone call. It's  from an informant they haven't worked in six months. He sounds terrified and fears for his life and that of his girlfriend. When the boys meet up with him he informs them that a White Supremacist group he was arranging a drug deal with learned who he was working with and he was forced to give  up Crockett and Tubbs. Distraught the man throws himself in front of an oncoming semi. That night after investigating the scene of the crime Crockett and Tubbs get recruited by the Miami P.D.. The local cops want the boys to go undercover for the drug cartel and see the deal through. They also want them to root out the mole who has compromised their identities. This dangerous mission sends the men to exotic locales like the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Paraguay, and eventually Cuba. Their connection is a small time dealer named Yero (John Ortiz in one of the film's best performances ). Crockett and Tubbs pose as smugglers in possession of a super fast boat that is undetectable by radar since it travels low and fast. Yero doesn't trust them but Isabella, his banker,  does. She is played by the beautiful Gong Li and with two lookers like her and Colin Farrell a romance is inevitable. Crockett and Tubbs figure out how low on the chain Yero is and realize that they are going to have do numerous drops until they find the higher up responsible for the murder of their informant. Since Crockett is escorting Isabella to Cuba for the perfect mojito Tubbs is left to arrange the meetings with the dealers. This causes friction between the two partners since everyone but Crockett realizes the danger he is in by sleeping with Yero's woman. With Mann directing and the above mentioned locales the film looks great and he has assembled a capable cast who all give good performances. Foxx does a lot more of the work than Farrell making him a little more like able. Ortiz is a very colorful villain in the \\"Scarface\\" tradition. Gong Li does a good job of capturing the fear and independence of a woman involved in this line of work. As with most Mann films  the background players are deserving of a lot more screen time. In this case you have the excellent Justin Theroux who is part of Crockett and Tubb's team and the gorgeous and talented Naomie Harris who is Ricardo's girlfriend Trudy. The two have a fair amount of scenes but I wish they could have been written a little better rather than just appearing in the background as support for Crockett and Tubbs. The action scenes are few and far between but when they happen they are easily the best thing going for the film. The last half hour in particular is exactly what made Heat and Collateral masterpieces. You wish that that kind of energy and excitement happened more often rather than coming all at once in the film's final act.

B00130VASW|2.0|Originally, it was the 2 shakes of Zep, a dash of Santana and the visions of a suicidal artist set to lyrics that were then deconstructed and decayed into near-genius, cohesive yet boundless musical structures that set me ablaze!. I refer to the Coma.. debut c.d.    In the follow up releases, including Bedlam, their genuine attempts to birth a second Coma.. fall, for me, at best..in the \\"Coma..ball park\\" and no closer.    But hey, just think of the bands who've been unable to meet/beat their debuts (you know who they are and they know who they are/no names necessary) and still have at it. Good for them and good for us; Mars Volta and the others might have another touchdown in them.  I'll keep cheering!

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Hi folks:    Here is my review of EVERWOOD (All four seasons, not just season one).    What a wonderful treasure, indeed. A family show that has it all: courage, compassion, love, heart-ache, heart-break, heart-on-the-mend, heart-happy, culture, religion (Jewish/Christian harmony), adventure in all its glorious forms, small town/big town dichotomy, conflict, upheaval, shock, depression, trials of the youth, difficulties of middle-age, and the wisdom of the elderly. All these come together in four fabulous seasons of Everwood TV. The first season will have you flying through a range of emotions and asking many questions about the world and how it works.     Do yourself a favor and buy this fabulous work of art. It will keep on giving the more you watch it. Now, the rest is up to you. Buy this wonderful show, watch it, and then come back here and leave your reviews.     There is something in this show for everybody.     Cheers,  Peter
B000PFU7OO|5.0|First off, I loved this movie... but it wasn't the storyline that resonated, it was the music. Glen Hansard puts everything out there when he sings his song. The emotion is not hidden at all when he sings. You can hear it in his voice, the strain. Hansard and Marketa Irglova are a musical match made in heaven. They complement each other perfectly.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|REALLY GREAT LOVE JOE, ERIC AND KENNY.  LOVE THE BLUES!!!!! AND THIS IS A GREAT DVD AND A AWESOME BAND!!!!!  MADE ME BUY MORE JOE BONAMASSA CDS
B000EGDB10|4.0|This film is a mixture of suspence/action and mystery. It can get a bit complicated so I really recommend a 2nd viewing to catch everything. Though this came out a while ago, the movie doesn't feel dated. And the action scenes are just as great as they were when this film first came out. Especially the wire act. Really tense stuff. Tom Cruise really carries this film, he's very spot on and engaging in this. Its a great role for him. All in all, a real solid film.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a great movie. Well done. Specially as the main characters are not popular and experienced but these two are amazing... and their music too. i was really liked the first part of the movie and just realized that this man (Hansard) can actually sing and play guitar. It was not  just a lip singing. I never heard of Hansard or that lovely girl until I watched this movie. And the end of story, I was curious to find out who they are and their music.    Little disappointed about the end of story and just expected little more rich ending.....and another down side is lack of lighting and don't know whether it done purposely but it seems like low budget film.     Overall this is a great movie, great story and Well done. I really enjoyed my evening with this guy and girl.
0375842381|5.0|Please read these books!<br /><br />Really, really, really give yourself the time with these books and relish the journey you will take with them.<br /><br />You may have heard all the comments about how these books contain a storyline designed to undermine the organized churches as we know them today but those comments take the story out of its context. Like so many novels, an opportunity is taken, is created, to teach us something important. This is a beatiful, hopeful fable, one which as childrens stories usually have, contains a moral tale for the adults too.<br /><br />People who wish to take parts of the story as attacks on their faith should take the opportunity to study their faith being shaken, see which leaves fall off and be proud of the branches that remain sturdy.<br /><br />For everybody in general, this is an excellent tale and the end is the best. For that you will have to read the book!
B00004U28G|5.0|I received this product quickly and it was just as promised. I like the movie, I have seen it before.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Saw this with a friend and had to buy it.  Not only is the musical well done, with the majority of the Original Broadway Cast, but it has tons of extra features and deleted scenes.
1416523359|4.0|I picked this one up when it first came out in paperback.  After Cell, I was ready for another crazy ride.  Unlike Cell however, I found it very hard to get into this one when I first started it in April.  I put it down and moved on to other things.  I came back to Lisey's Story in the days before the release of Duma Key, and it was like reading a different book from the first attempt.  I thought this was a really great story and enjoyable read.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|It's b&w with English subtitle, but it's worth everything to get and watch it! It has a simple, but beautiful and profound message based on an excellent plot; the film is extremely stylish, which reminded me of Matrix. It simply blew me away after I finished watching it.<br /><br />Absolutely worth watching, buy or rent it today!!!
B0006IUDXA|4.0|A Fantastic Series that launched a new way of thinking about how to solve problems with only what is at hand. Making one thing into another kind of thinking.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|Very good calculator. The leather case must be improved - it is not easy to put the calculator back.
B00130UFY2|1.0|The movie itself is a good conclusion to the trilogy, but do not download it from Amazon Unbox. Drive to the video store, walk if you have to, but don't try to watch this heavily compressed version of it. As the other reviewer said (and I wish I had trusted them) the high speed motion which is an essential part of this action movie is made unwatchable by the video compression artifacts. It's not even like other high speed mpeg artifacts I've seen such as those on digital cable where everything goes blocky - this is like true ghosting like early LCDs. I tried to watch this on a 43in plasma TV and it was awful. Every time something moved quickly there were two or three overlapping versions of it.  Take the advice of these reviews - don't buy or rent this movie as a digital download. It might only be $4, but it's $4 wasted.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I thought Across the Universe was great! What an amazingly well thought out plot, very well executed and then brought together. I waited a long time for the DVD to come out.  I was only 13 years old back in the late sixties, but I remember it like yesterday. Back then my friends and me, air-guitared to the Beatle's music on our B-B Guns. Across the Universe brought all those memories back, bell-bottoms, peace signs, sit-ins, long-hair, and a lot of braless hippie girls (sigh!). The music in the film was done in such a way as to give deeper meaning to the Beatle's music, it really made you think more about the lyrics. If this movie had been done back in the seventies it would have been a classic by now. Hopefully   the young people that see it today can get a better perspective of the Viet Nam War era. The wounds are still tender of the friends lost there.  But maybe a new generation will understand why we loved the Beatles so much back then and still do, and how that common thread still ties us all together.  (A friend from high school, younger brother was in the dance troupe of this movie.)
B00006CXSS|5.0|The product arrived in 3 days and was brand new and in excellent condition.  I definitely recommend this provider.
0765318741|3.0|Anyone who has seen the recent movie starring Will Smith knows the basic idea: one man, alone, and vampires. Lots of vampires. And lots of scary. That said, the book in its particulars is very different from the movie.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time deciding how I feel about it. I saw the movie first, and I wish I hadn't. The movie version changed so much: the location, the main character, some major plot points. For the movie, the story was flattened and simplified, more clear-cut. The adrenaline level was ramped up for some jump-out-of-your-seat moments.<br /><br />The book is more subtle and creepy, less jolting. Themes of evolution and questions about human survival are explored in an intriguing way. The story is well-written, and not nearly as dated as you'd expect, given this was first published 50 years ago. And yet, I really hoped for something more intense, some culmination of the suspense and lurking danger. The movie was all about loud noises and climactic fights, and I guess it left me expecting something that the book was not written to deliver. That's not fair, but it did color my experience.<br /><br />Librarians: this book is a must-read, if only for the passage that takes place in LAPL's Central Library. You'll just love the author's progressive view of people who become librarians (cough cough).
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is an opera more than a spaghetti Western. Not only did Leone outdo himself on this one, he outdid Kubrick in many ways.  If you've never seen it before, you're in for a sensual treat; just don't be expecting a cowboy film in the usual sense.  The long opening shots alone are worth the cost of the DVD.
0143038419|2.0|This book started off great and the first section of the book definitely delivers. It's a blast to live vicariously through her as she enjoys the pleasures (minus one significant one) of Italy. The second section really gets bogged down in an uninteresting and even a bit hokey trip to an ashram. The third section picks up a bit but the book starts to feel too much like a personal diary and has nothing profound to say. My interest and the strong writing both seem to peter out as the book goes on.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|You'll either love \\"Barry Lyndon\\" or hate it, but you won't be ambivalent. While it's a masterpiece of cinematography, costumes and script, the pace can try the patience of Job. A word of advice: turn off the phones and don't answer the doorbell. Once the lyric beauty of this work has you ensnared, you don't want to ruin the mood!
1401307787|4.0|People consider this book a contemporary classic on meditation for good reasons. It's lovely and accessible. Jon Kabat-Zinn tackles the difficult task of explaining the nonverbal practice of meditation, which many find alien or even threatening, and makes it accessible, useful and even homey. He explains meditation not only with references to classic texts, but also by recounting his own experiences, drawing parallels with Thoreau, and discussing work and family contexts. The chapters are brief, some as short as a page, each focusing on a single topic. Many are accompanied with prompting questions or simple exercises you can try immediately. getAbstract recommends this book to people interested in reducing their stress, deepening their self-awareness and sharpening their focus.
1400062756|3.0|I found out about this book in an article by NPR.  The article said that students who learned how their brain work performed better then those who just learned study skills.  I was hoping this book would explain how to teach students how their brain actually works.  Throughout the book it constantly tells them that you need to do this, but it never actually says how.  I had to go and buy another book for that.  It does give some useful information about what distinguishes hard workers and how to encourage students in this direction.
B000E6FSPW|4.0|Would be perfect if the Heart's on fire (extended) was included and Sweetest Victory had the same \\"Sweetest Victory\\" background.  Don't Legacy know that the missing end of Heart's on Fire is one hell of a motivator in the Gym or track (especially when someone is trying to push themselves past their limits)?     Every track is the same (only better sound quality) except that Sweetest Victory is changed though. The sound   quality of Sweetest Victory is somewhat better than the original but it doesn't have that umph when the background is saying \\"Sweetish Victory\\". They should have just made the sound quality better while keeping the same (or nearly the same) \\"Sweetest Victory\\" background. Then many wouldn't care that it is changed. IMO, Sweetest Victory is only slightly worse than the original. My main beef is with Hearts on Fire though. I desperately want to work out hearing the finale of this song when Rocky   climbs the mountain (and Drago is running the treadmill). I would probably be as strong as Hulk with it. This still is a good buy though (especially for those who own the original Scotti Bros. soundtrack).    P.S. This is the best Rocky movie of the series (And one of my all time favorites). This should have been the last movie of the series though since Drago represented the pinnacle of human perfection (there can exist   no greater human opponent) and yet Rocky did the impossible and beat him. The movie should have also been the last one because it had the greatest messages ever (Change for the better of mankind and judge others only based on the content of their heart and character). Anyone who says that this isn't the best movie of the series is an idiot and don't know jack about movies or messages. No offense.
0793518326|5.0|This is the best book available for learning Beatles music. It is transcribed great and seems to have every instrument available. Also every song the Beatles ever wrote. How can you beat that?
B000P12LWY|5.0|I think that this was a great show and it was not I expected. I did not expect so much from this show and I learned a lot. Especially about the Black Plague. I thought the Black Plague happened sometime later in history, but not so far back. It was both entertaining and educational.
B0000057CL|4.0|Music of the Gothic Era. Notre Dame Period (c. 1160 - 1250); Ars Antiqua (c. 1250 - 1320); Ars nova (c. 1320 - 1380). Performed by the Early Music Consort of London, directed by David Munrow. Recorded in the Chapel of Charter House, Godalming, Surrey (England) and in Conway Hall, London (England) in 1975. First published on LP in 1976. This selection published on CD in 1985 as Deutsche Grammophon Archiv 415 292-2. Total playing time: 60'31\\". (Since this time, DG have re-released the entire original recording on two CDs: see [[ASIN:B00006L3IE Music of the Gothic Era]].<br /><br />After more than 30 years, this pioneering medieval recording is showing its age. Today, it is not considered historically correct to use instruments the way David Munrow did (here there are bells, fiddles, lute, bandora, psaltery, harp, organ, percussion, cornetts, recorder and shawms - played incidentally by such outstanding musicians as Christopher Hogwood and others who later joined the Academy of Ancient Music). And many today would be unwilling to have the majority of sung texts performed by one or two countertenors - as much as I respect James Bowman and Charles Brett, what you get to hear on this disc can occasionally fall into the \\"crowing\\" category so popular in the early years of the early music revival. And, finally, the Deutsche Grammophon engineering, although excellent as usual, leaves the instrumental accompaniments very much in the background in comparison with the voices which are superbly captured.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a fascinating piece of repertoire, one of the last recordings David Munrow made before his unfortunate suicide. The first twenty minutes or so are dedicated to organum by Leonin and Perotin (\\"the Great\\"), two of the first musicians at Paris's newly-built Notre Dame cathedral. Together with David Munrow's notes, these tracks offer unusually incisive insights into the development of medieval monophony and polyphony. There follow five anonymous motets from the Ars Antiqua period plus one by Petrus de Cruce and two by Adam de la Halle, both of whose music is, even today, very rarely heard. The Ars Nova section contains four anonymous motets plus two motets each by Philippe de Vitry (whose music has since been explored by Benjamin Bagby's Sequentia on Deutsche Harmonia Mundi) and Guillaume de Machau(l)t, whose musical production has been a mainstay of the early music movement. The CD closes with an instrumental version of a \\"hocket\\" by Machault played on cornetts and shawms. If you don't know what a \\"hocket\\" is, this will show you - the word means something like \\"hiccup\\" and indicates that the melody springs from one voice to another with short breaks (which, when sung, can indeed sound like hiccupping).ntiqua period plus one by Petrus de Cruce and two by Adam de la Halle, both of whose music is, even today, very rarely heard.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|I will agree that there were parts in the film that were quite different from the book, and Jane Austen purists will object, but I thought this film was nicely done.  I especially LOVED it when Ann Elliot got the letter and ran, yes actually ran to find him.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Rupert Perry -Jones was excellent as captain Wentworth and the chemistry between the two of them seemed more real in this film version.  I also thought Anthony Head as Sir Walter Elliot exactly as I imagined him, so vain and shallow.  The only thing I will say I didn't like about the film was the ending.  If you've never read the book it could be a bit misleading, Kellynch Hall cannot be sold as it was entailed to go to Sir Walter's heir who was Ann's cousin.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|Nothing short of pure genius! I am without a doubt that everyone who contributed to this film made every effort to deliver an emotionally charged portrayal of life through the genius of the Beatles - it's refreshing to see some great film making for a change! Well done!
0743289684|5.0|Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali is an excellent autobiography.  She humbly tells the story of her tumultuous life as a Somalian Muslim woman.  Her book has given me an insight of a world far different from my own and a perspective I would have never have known without her writing.     As a testimony to my ignorance, I have never heard of Ali.  She was rated by Time as one of the top 100 most influential people in 2005.   I feel privileged to gain this glimpse into a truly remarkable person.  She hides neither her failings, struggles, or successes.     Ali gives the reader a first person account of the African Muslim that you probably have never heard.  And as a result of her confessions her life is sought by some followers of that religion.  Her main goal is to share the toils and struggles of many women in Muslim homes that have no voice as they are forced to submit to there husbands (even when arranged) who beat and rape them.  She highlights a dark side of Islam that the media is afraid to talk about.  You will be impressed by her courage and enraged by her facts.    She is one person and her life experiences do not reflect all Muslim women.  Yet she does reflect many more than you probably ever imagined.  I was greatly enlightened by the synchronism of the tribal religions into some parts of Islam.  It is extremely relevant in understanding the tribal conflict in the Christian nation of Kenya.  I encourage you to read this book to broaden your scope on the world (especially Somalia, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Holland) and on a religion you might never experience except through the honest eyes of Ali.
075640407X|5.0|I won't make this terribly long as you can see by the average review score that this book is GREAT.  Very real characters and a story that moves at a brisk pace.  Magic is kept to a realistic level.  The main character has to use wits more often than magic to get out of jams. A unique story that really holds you from the first to the last page. I can't wait for the next book.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|This is a movie you will want to buy for your collection.  I bought the deluxe edition, hoping that Blu-Ray will also come out with an edition, which I will promptly purchase.  This is one of Charlton Heston's best, absolutely.  Sophia Loren was never more beautiful, and the film is visually stunning, with a great supporting cast.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy the film, make yourself a salami sandwich, grab a drink, kick back and watch this story unfold, sitting in your own private home.  It just doesn't get any better than that!  When the movie is over, you'll want to watch it again....and again.....and again.  It's about time it was released in DVD format.  I have waited a long, long time (as I am sure many, many others also have, as well).  This is Hollywood at its best.
B000VBP382|5.0|This was just what I wanted for my wife for Valentine's Day. She FLIPPED when she saw it! The beauty and quality of the packaging is very good. The companion booklet inside is wonderful. We didn't realize it also contained the soundtrack, so that was an added bonus. Definitely worth the extra $$. Strongly recommended!
0800141628|5.0|\\"Stand by Me\\" was filmed in 1986 but set in the 1950's with all the usual back-ground rock and roll music, like the movie American Grafitti. It is an exquisitely nostalgic and realistic story of four boys on the brink of puberty, barking on a quest to be heroes. In a way, it is a modern day Tom Sawyer adventure. Gordie, (Wil Wheaton), is the intelligent, creative one with the obviously bright future. His best buddy, Chris (River Phoenix), is the tough friend in order to hide the pain from the physical abuse he endures at home. He knows he is good inside, but deals with the hurt by the hard shell of rough talk and actions. The other two boys in the group are Vern (Jerry O'Connell), a pudgy tag-along, and Teddy (Corey Feldman), a loyal, funny but troubled kid with a death wish.<br /><br />When the four boys hear about a dead body 20 miles down the railroad tracks from their small Oregon town, they secretly set out to find the body and find out who it is. They have several setbacks and through it all, Gordie, Chris, Vern, and Teddy are such perfect characters and actors that it is hard to believe they are really acting. It reveals the simple life of children who know that soon there is a future that could tear them apart. They know time changes what the truth is and it will never be the same.<br /><br />The \\"greaser\\" gang of older boy teenagers also want to find the body - this adds to the competition and the pace of the movie. They want to find the body first and are surprised by Gordie's strong will and determination to have justice.<br /><br />\\"Stand by ME\\" is a must see movie, no matter what your age. It hits all the important points of understanding your need for friendship in tough times.  The movie is based on a novel by Stephen King and narrated by Richard Dreyfus (who plays the adult Gordon Lachance), who gives the right amount of humor to the film.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|The writing was good, the story intriguing, but I constantly stumbled over the author's clear hatred of women.<br /><br />I won't go into the inability to finish or even provide good background for any of the 8 story lines going on, it is, after all meant to be a series.  What I found hard to read past was the underlying disrespect, hatred and contempt for women.  There are no less than 8 rape scenes, including a whole culture where rape is an accepted means of procreation.  Leave aside the incest, (you are suppose to hate those characters) even one of the heroes commits child molestation and rape.<br /><br />So let's set all that aside and consider that every woman in the cast of characters is portrayed as either conniving and vindictive, insane, weak or painfully foolish, except the little girl masquerading as a boy.<br /><br />Don't know what is going on in the author's life to make him hate women so, but it makes it difficult to read about the world of his creation.
B000065KH4|3.0|A religious, small town in the French countryside receives newcomers Vianne (Juliette) Binoche and her daughter.  They come dressed in red, and soon open a chocolate shop across from the church on the first week of Lent.  Scenes of  townspeople in confession describing the delicious chocolates are meant to be titillating.  Chocolate treats from the new shop is described sensually with double-meaning, including sex and other sins of enjoyment.<br /><br />The mayor launches a campaign to get rid of the new chocolate shop that is causing so much excitement in this once sleepy little village.  Then the children see \\"pirates\\" along the river and Vianne's daughter runs to her mother announcing the landing of the swarthy crew.  It is a band of Irish river people and headed by a handsome Roux (Johnny Depp  - who plays pirates well).  The beautiful Vianne and the handsome Roux become romantic as they understand each other as outsiders and agents of change for all they touch.<br /><br />\\"Chocolat\\" is a sweet movie, but trite in that  it suggests that all a person needs to liberate their soul, forget all the wrongs done to them, and become happy is a piece of candy.  There is a \\"leave it to Beaver\\" feel to the movie - too perfect, and the dialogue is often boring.  Judi Dench plays a role as a local diabetic who does not want to give in to her disease.  She keeps eating the sweets and enjoying life despite her critical condition.  I felt pain in all the actors trying to keep a French accent going - it did not come naturally for most in the film.<br /><br />Overall, enjoyable and more of a \\"chick flick\\" with a sweet chocolate shop princess and a swarthy pirate to bring it to a Disney ending.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Enigma for years and have all their CD's.  I read reviews for Posteriori before I ordered it and was surprised at the mixed reviews.  I will say that in my humble opinion Enigma just keeps getting better and better!  They have a very distinct sound and that sound is what I want from them.  I don't have to analyze music to death to know that I like it, and that it touches my soul.  If the rythyms move me, what more do I need?  When I got Voyaguer,I put it in my car CD changer and didn't take it out for a month, and Posteriori will be very much the same.  Some people think Enigma should change their sound....if they did, it wouldn't be Enigma.  Be thankful they continue to do what they do best.  My only complaint is that it's too long between new CD's.  I'd be happy if they could release 2 or more new ones in a year.
0439295017|5.0|This book is fun and also offers some excellent insight into the ways wizards think and how they would confront the problem of dangerous creatures and also why they find the less dangerous animals beautiful. There is also a lot of information on classifying the different species of magical creatures, as well as a distinction between a magical \\"being\\" and a magical \\"beast.\\" The opening of the book, a forward by Newt Scamander is also exciting, as he explains what drew him towards the subject of magical creatures and his travels around the world. Whenever I read this book I feel close to Harry's world of witches and wizards. As Dumbledore's says, if you refuse to buy this book because you don't think charity is signigicant enough, I can only hope that when you meet a manticore along the way, a wizard is feeling charitable enough to help you!
0810994739|5.0|I bought this for my 10 year old son.  Any book that encourages children to read is a wonderful investment.  Not only is my 10 year old enjoying this purchase, but his 11 year old older brother has read it to his 4 year old brother, and his 7 year old younger brother is reading it now.  It is a fun read for many ages,and as a parent it brings me much pleasure to find my sons share in spending time that doesn't involve television or video games. Definitely worth the price!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This documentary was so gripping and deep, I watched it twice in the same day. McNamara begins with his experiences as a young statistician working under LeMay during World War II. He explains the cold approaches (e.g. firebombing) devised to destroy Japan's ability to wage war. Interleaved are reflections on his personal life, which give the viewer an often unseen side of the man often labeled \\"An IBM Machine with Legs\\". We are given an inside look into the decision making processes that led to the onset and resolution of the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as a detailed account of the Vietnam War. He spent a significant part of his later life as an ex-SECDEF retrospectively reflecting on the major events in which he played a major part. Decades later he visits leaders of Cuba and Vietnam to learn more about the thinking and rationale of the actions of the other side.    While one might dismiss McNamara given the vast number of American and Vietnamese that died while he was SECDEF, it was moving for him to show humility. His broad and deep recognition of his biggest mistakes is an important milestone for the history of leaders of the Defense Department. Hopefully other leaders follow and admit their mistakes and demand current leaders not go down the wrong path again.    Another reviewer is correct in noting the framing of his lessons are a bit arbitrary. Some lessons overlap (\\"Rationality will not save us\\" and \\"You can't change human nature.\\"), some are too general (\\"Get the Data\\"), some are too specific, and taken together, they are certainly not complete (\\"Avoid killing\\" seems like a good lesson). However, if you relate each one to the war in Iraq, you get the sense that the current administration could have done much better in their analysis and subsequent handling of the war.

Matthew does a great job of playing the lead character, all of the actors really did a good job with their characters.  You connected and had fun with them as they went.<br /><br />Some of the action was just too much of a stretch, but that is part of watching a action movie, to suspend reality to have fun.  I'm still plagued with the question, why was the iron_clad in Africa in the first place?
B0001HAHXW|3.0|The power of Robert Johnson's music lies in his haunting lyrics, stark arrangements, and tortured delivery.  Unfortunately, in reworking Johnson's songs for \\"Me and Mr Johnson\\", Eric Clapton has robbed them of their original power, substituting instead competent, but out-of-place, Chicago Blues-style arrangements and disappointingly hackneyed vocal delivery.  Johnson's lyrics alone are left to carry the load and, alas, they cannot.    Clapton can do better, and, indeed, he has.  Listen to \\"Malted Milk\\" from [[ASIN:B000002MFE Unplugged]] and \\"Terraplane Blues\\" and \\"Ramblin' on My Mind\\" from   [[ASIN:B000660UN0 Sessions For Robert J. (CD + DVD)]] for proof that he can interpret Johnson's music in inspired fashion.  Given the magnitude of Robert Johnson's influence on Eric Clapton, a Clapton album comprised entirely of Johnson's songs seemed a very promising undertaking.  If only \\"Me and Mr Johnson\\" had lived up to that promise . . .

0446528056|2.0|How many more \\"opposites attract\\" novels is Nicholas Sparks gonna write? I get that the stories are different, but it's still way too predictable and overdone. I'm starting to think the whole concept of the book taking place with John joining the military and the whole September 11th thing was just to have the \\"opposites attract\\" romance a new scenario from his other books.    And why is it that once again the couple falls in love within days of knowing eachother. I can't say I didn't predict it, but I still found it ridiculous. And he kept using phrases like 'I felt as though we'd be together forever\\" and \\"I wanted to hold her like this forever\\" and \\"my love would last forever.\\" Note, all of these examples were said only several pages apart, and, yes, within only three days of knowing eachother.     Honestly, the book did not become even remotely interesting to me until after John and Savannah broke up(although his his constant obsessing and depression got on my nerves). I did enjoy reading about his relationship with his father. It was the only time I thought the book was well writen. It was the only unique thing about it. And I liked reading about what he was going through in the army, at least when he was not talking about Savannah. Everything else was just same old same old.     Anyways, two stars, only because I liked the stuff between John and his dad. Hated the stuff with Savannah.

B000058983|1.0|This is a 5 star \\"masterpiece\\"????I just cannot believe all the accolades and sky high rhetoric written about this hunk of junk!!  This album sounds like the soundtrack of some C grade wannabe hippie movie made in the late 60s that fails miserably and is already outdated when it comes out (you know the type). For you folks out there that never heard this album before, save yourself the acid indigestion and the waste of $10 and DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! I'd rather listen to a buzz saw cut through 10 miles of rusty nails than to hear this again.

B00004W56S|5.0|Smallcreep's Day is one of my favorite albums of all time. One can really hear Mike's songwriting influence in Genesis with this album. On this solo record, Mike puts together an excellent band, including Ant Phillips, Genesis's original guitarist but he plays keyboards on this album. Someone mentioned in an earlier review that it sounded as if Mike had something to prove on this album, and I agree with that. The songwriting and musicianship are excellent. I also like the sound on this album. It sounds as if the album was recorded in a large hall or castle which adds to the mood. Mike does all the guitars and bass, as well as guitar synth. Sometimes it sounds as if there's 2 keyboards playing, but one is Mike. Whoever thinks Mike isn't a great guitarist, needs to listen to his playing on this album. \\"Out In the Daylight\\" has some of the best guitar work I've heard. I don't judge how good a guitarist is by how fast he can play( although Mike DOES do some fast licks here). I judge on how he makes the entire band sound. I would love to see Mike rejoin with this band lineup again. This is a truly special album!!
B00082ZS5W|4.0|For those of you who value both high quality video and audio, this DVD delivers as much as one can ask from a non-HiDef video source.  I was very surprised at the production quality.  It appears the producer of this disc knew what he/she was doing.      The concert is filmed in 1.78:1 anamorphic, not 4:3 pan & scan as Amazon's site incorrectly states.  For those of you with a newer 16:9 TV, this means no black bars.  The video completely fills the screen without requiring the use of your TV's horrible Stretch, Zoom, or Squeeze modes that end up distorting the picture and detracting from the overall viewing experience.  And unlike many concert videos that I own, Dido's concert is filmed entirely in the same aspect ratio.  So there isn't a crazy mixture of 4:3 video cameras and crappy Hi-8 hand-held cam footage being spliced into the main video.  The video bit-rate seems very high, making this standard definition disc (480p) look incredible even when upconverted for viewing on my 1080p plasma set.  I don't even own an upconverting DVD player.  I'm just using a 7-yr old, standard def progressive scan DVD player and allowing my TV's internal scaler to upconvert the video.  There are no artifacts or motion blur typically associated with poorly encoded DVDs, especially concert DVDs where it appears the level of professionalism is extremely low.  If you've ever seen \\"Alanis Morissette, Jagged Little Pill, Live\\" then you know what I'm talking about.      There are no dvd Extras or Special features on this disc.  Those omissions provided more disc space for the HQ video and also allowed the producer to include 3 separate audio tracks: 2-ch PCM Stereo, 5.1 Dolby Digital, & 5.1 DTS.  Most \\"normal\\" people probably don't care about DTS or even know what it is, but many geeks and audiophiles prefer a DTS audio track over DD when available. (note for DTS audio, you need DTS capable equipment)    As for the the performance itself, it's just a great show.  The songs are generally sung in at a faster tempo and with more energy than Dido's studio tracks.  The little narrations Dido provides between sets help explain the songs and provide her fans with some added insight into her personality....  i was kinda surprised to learn she really isn't the \\"quiet, stay-at-home\\" type I've always pictured her to be.  Instead she sounds kinda wild and I like it :)      I really liked the concert's simple and elegant lighting without the distracting strobes and lasers typical of the industry.  For the most part, Dido is lit with a soft blue or violet spotlight against a dark background that makes her skin luminous.  It's just very pretty and easy on the eyes.  Also the video cuts, pans and zoom are kept to a minimum here thank god.  NO STUPID MTV like editing here where everything is limited to 2 seconds per shot before panning and zooming and swooping and shaking to the next out-of-focus 2-second shot!    I highly recommend this DVD.  Unlike motion picture DVDs which I've stopped purchasing altogether, I'll enjoy this concert again and again.  A must buy for Dido fans.
0743496736|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic and even if I didn't agree with one or two things, I found a lot of what she writes to be realistic and this is coming from someone who grew up with undiagnosed ADD. I didn't have it easy and I know firsthand much of what she writes here. Another reviewer mentions the possibility of a fictional retelling of Columbine Shooting, I could not agree more. It surprises me today, after we have been through so much with our schools that people still don't get it. Our kids are in danger, I have lived first hand through the struggles of being different and I am telling you we have to be more aware of what our kids are going through at school. It seems to me, with some of the negative reviews that some people just don't want to see what is happening. Maybe I am wrong, maybe they are simply reacting to a story and not what could be reality.<br /><br />Great book, great read and more than that it's important and that makes me highly recommend this book!<br /><br />I am the author of:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0741444402 One Boy's Struggle: A Memoir: Surviving Life with Undiagnosed ADD]]
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|I have always loved Tom Hanks but this is still one of my favorite movies of his.  His acting is amazing.   You would actually think that he is a 12 year old boy.  All the acting is great including Robert Loggia, John Heard and Elizabeth Perkins.  The movie is well done and a realistic ending besides.  Great movie!!!  This is one of these movies that you can watch over and over again.  It is timeless.
0321544080|4.0|Picture this.  You meet one of the world's great photographers in a bar.  He has a stack of pictures with him from his portfolio.  As you go through the pictures, he talks about them, about the people in the photographs, and how he made each of them.  About a third of the way through you realize that when he talks about the technical details he talks mostly about the lighting, and you are sorry you didn't pick up on that right from the beginning, but now you listen avidly to try to learn his lighting techniques.<br /><br />Then, about two-thirds of the way through, he stops talking about the lighting, and starts meandering about the photo editors he knew, and how he may have sacrificed some of his family life to be a photographer, and how he came up through the ranks, and that's interesting too.<br /><br />When Joe McNally talks about lighting a picture of James Brown, or Sophia Loren, or Larry Tisch, the techniques he uses seem to be ones you could use.  But when he talks about getting a bunch of masks from the Smithsonian to shoot Michelle Pfeiffer, or five full length mirrors set up on the field for a picture of shortstop Ozzie Smith, or using 10 or 15 2400 watt lights to light fielder Eric Davis, you may hope that you can at least get inspiration because you are never going to have that kind of equipment, or if you are, then to quote McNally, \\"you don't need my advice\\".  And don't take a peek at McNally's equipment until you come to that page in normal reading or you may decide the book is not for you.<br /><br />If you are looking for instruction, it's here amongst the stories, even if it's delivered in a non-structured sort of way.  I haven't invested in a dozen Speedotrons, but after reading this book, I did decide to upgrade my umbrella to a couple of softboxes.  On the other hand if you are interested in looking at a portfolio of great pictures, McNally has them.  And if you like to listen to photographers tell stories about photography, often at their own expense, you'll probably love this book.<br /><br />Other then the lighting there is little of a technical nature here.  There's nothing about exposure, or depth of field or Photoshop.  I am certain that the people that talked the author into writing this book loved the stories and the way they were told and how they related back occasionally to transforming a vision into an image by using equipment.  McNally's personality comes through.  Whether this is the way for you to learn some lighting tricks will depend on what you feel about winnowing them out of the stories and pictures.  On the other hand, Joe McNally is a great guy to have a drink with.love this book.    Other then the lighting there is little of a technical nature here.

B000XGDO04|4.0|With declining album sales, and with the smashing success of Amy Winehouse (millions sold, 5 Grammys won), it seems every British record label has been on a major quest to discover the next Amy Winehouse as a solution to their woes. One of the names being touted for that post is Adele Atkins, who had every major and minor music critic jostling to outdo each other in lavishing her with plaudits. Heck, she's even getting a Brit award later this month, and all this before she had even released her debut.<br /><br />While most girls her age grew up listening to Britney, Spice Girls and Kylie, Adele was listening to some of those too, as well as to Eva Cassidy, Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, and some Amy also. She does have a rich, smoky world-weary voice to boot. Listening to \\"19\\" (titled after her age), I didn't find it as immediate as Amy's CD was, but it is a grower and there is an attempt at sonic variety. The album was produced by Mark Ronson (who also did Amy's, and just won a Grammy for producer of the year).<br /><br />I guess in an attempt to deflect too much comparison, Adele's disc isn't restricted only to smoky retro jazz/blues sounds in the 12 tracks. In fact, opening cut \\"Daydreams\\" is an acoustic ballad as are \\"Best for last\\" (though this has jazzy phrasings), and the sparse bluesy \\"Crazy for you\\".<br /><br />Lead-off single (and #2 UK hit) \\"Chasing pavements\\" is a lush, sweeping jazzy power ballad. Similar is closing cut the stirring \\"Hometown glory\\" (an ode to Tottenham), a stunning piano/string ballad and my favourite. \\"Melt my heart to stone\\" is a downbeat blues tinged string filled ballad, while \\"First love\\" is lullaby-like, complete with tinkling bells. \\"Make you feel my love\\" is a sombre (almost hymnal) piano ballad with weeping cello/violin.<br /><br />Upping the tempo are \\"Cold shoulder\\" with skittery beats, \\"Right as rain\\" (Jazzy and bluesy, very Amy Winehouse), the catchy \\"My same\\" (with a snappy jazz/pop feel, I love it!) and \\"Tired\\" (lovely change in tempo midway).<br /><br />The new Amy Winehouse? Not quite (one listen to \\"Back to black\\" puts paid to any such notion), but she should be able to carve a niche for herself in a field that promises to get even more crowded as the year progresses (with people like Duffy coming). Not bad at all for a 19 year old.w Amy Winehouse?

B00004VXF2|1.0|This 'album' ain't worth the discussion heaped upon it. All the vast praise for \\"Lou The Genius\\" is a bunch of bull. This was the ultimate statement of pretentiousness from an egomaniac.  Anyone doubt he wasn't a CREEP? Read his parts in \\"Please Kill Me\\", or his interview in \\"Punk: The Original\\".   Vain and deluded enough that anything he did was genius, this CD, with people gawking over it like it's some kind of grand statement and genuine art, reminds me of the idea of someone taking a crayon to a canvas and scrawling all over it, and everyone wanting to be \\"hip\\" finds the most fluent ways of raving about its beauty, its subtleties.    Folks, This is NOTHING but noise and feedback.  You think this grand art, great music?  This record was and will always be a big \\"F--- You\\" to his FANS.  Anyone who swallows this tripe, anyone who gets this for any reason other than curiosity's sake, you're buying into it, the hype.    AVOID.    Stick with your Velvets albums. There's actual MUSIC there! How AMAZING!    To sum up, trying to find greatness in this is like looking into your toilet bowl after a bowel movement and hoping to see diamonds or gold.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This season of Veronica Mars was constructed more like two small seasons joined at the opening/closing credits. Once again, HQ scripts, ultra cool psycho babble and excellent filming and editing have made this boxed set the perfect TRIPLE end to this chapter in her story! And the beginning of a totally new storyline with no resolution in sight. Just Veronica walking of into the gloomy rain, thinking of her next course of action.<br /> With all three seasons in your hiddien DVD cabinet, you will always have something enjoyable and fun to watch.<br />One spoiler for me: I didn't like the FBI agent premise that was to be season 4 if the powers that be at Warner Brothers had their way! Or maybe that was just their way of justifying the cancellation of an excellent television show. You can be the judge as a bit of the unaired season 4 is included with season 3! It is amazing that less than 1 year after the last episode, Veronica Mars is already concidered a classic.
B00005JPFH|1.0|Oh why oh why did I watch this movie? I really liked the first one, but I hated the second installment. I think it's because I just couldn't believe Mr. Vegan attitude problem Tobey as my beloved Spiderman. It wasn't enough that he is just not convincing as any sort of hero, he also really cannot carry these movies on his mediocre acting shoulders. He isn't handsome, not even \\"goofy\\" handsome, his voice is akin to a 12 year old boy, and hearing it come out of Spiderman's mask makes me weep. Now they make this 3rd movie and it's as if the powers that be really wanted to make sure they ended on the worst note possible.<br />MJ (Dunst) and Peter (Maguire) have no chemistry, they never did. Her and Harry (Franco) actually do, and he is the more captivating character and actor than the lead. They make MJ an off Broadway actress, and Spidey is of course saving the city, but these kids aren't happy. She bombs, and he is now obsessed with finding his uncles \\"real\\" killer Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church, or \\"SandCGI\\" as I call him.  Harry is bent on revenge still for his father's death, that he blames Peter for. That is the whole plotline right there. Oh wait, there is a meteorite that crashes conveniently next to Peter and out comes CGI black ooze that turns poor Peter into EmoVenom.  Apparently this ooze, like the Pink ectoplasm in Ghostbusters 2 likes people who are angry, sad or just in need of a new hairstyle. Being forced to watch Tobey try to act ....dark...was so very painful. The outfit, the hair, the eyeliner, the demanding of \\"more milk and cookies\\" never has there been a darker character on film, ever. (rolls eyes)<br /><br />The big ending with Brock Venom (who's fake teeth couldn't have looked faker)  and SandCGI, with MJ in peril again (and by the way all her screams? Taken from previous spiderman movies, she didn't want to do them again) was as lame as could be. Stan Lee gave us a hero in spiderman, and Sam Raimi took that away.

B00005B4GU|4.0|I believe this release could have been an E.P.,Amnesiac or Dollars & Cents.A couple of tracks could have been included on Kid A.Of course,Kid A is a very,very,very good album.But it has two flaws.Treefingers and the title track.Strange tunes IMO.Those 2 tracks left Kid A short of being a masterpiece.Now,this LP has tracks that were ready for release on the Kid A disc.How do I know this? I was at a show,Warrington ,England,10/02/00,when the band played Dollars & Cents,Pyramid Song(called Egyption Song)I also own a bootleg from Holland,09/16/00.The band performed You And Whose Army? and Knives Out.Now,imagine those four tracks if they were on Kid A.That would have been a great disc.This release is uneven and never flows.Packt Like Sardines (studio) is a below average track.Live,it is a solid rocker.A burst of guitars jump at you during the live version.Thick buzz sounding bass/guitars,like The Beatles,circa Rubber Soul/Revolver.This version is weak and bland.Where are the guitars? I wish it could have been recorded with the same fire as the live version.Pulk,IMO,is not music.Its noise.You and Whose Army?,Im sorry,this studio version,unlike the live version,is not as good.Pyramid Song sounds very good,as does Knives Out,Dollars & Cents and I Might Be Wrong.These tracks are why I give this 4 stars,because they are so good.Maybe, a 5 track EP would have been better? Pyramid Song,Knives Out,D&C,IMBW,Packt Like Sardines.Thats a great E.P. Why is Morning Bell/Amnesiac here?Is this version better than the one from Kid A? IMO,no.Hunting Bears? is brutal.Like Spinning Plates is all cloudy and muddled sounding. The live version,is so much better.Thom ,alone at the piano.Its a haunting beautiful version performed live.Life In A Glass House.I cant tell you how I dread this tune.This disc should not have been released like this.IMO,an E.P. would have been great,like My Iron Lung from 1994.Again,this is just my opinion.Im not right,or wrong here.I just feel a few of these songs should have been included on Kid A or an E.P.The other tracks besides the 4 I mentioned,b sides.

B000FIMG68|4.0|This is a pretty good show. I like the character development especially with the flashbacks of the characters which are informative. They give reasons why the people on the island act the way they do especially under extreme circumstances. Often times a true person's nature comes out during extreme and fear-inducing times. I watch very few shows and this one is pretty good. I've watched some episodes of the newest season on tv and it's much better to watch on DVD-no commercials and a more cinematic feel to the show. It's not really cinematic when you got a cbs headline at the bottom of the show when there is still some time left for the show to end. It was enjoyable but don't get too obsessed! : )
B0010X73ZG|4.0|\\"The Mist\\" (based on a story by Stephen King) is a movie about monsters but not the ones you would expect. After a massive storm, a dense mist descends upon a small town in Maine, bringing with it a swarm of giant, blood-thirsty insects. When the monsters arrive, artist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane), finds himself and his young son trapped in the local supermarket with a large group of townspeople and it doesn't take long for him to realize that these people must band together if they hope to ever leave the store alive.     Although this is a monster movie, in the traditional, tentacles and fangs, sense. The giant insects get very little screen time. In a two hour movie, I only counted about six appearances of the insects and these are all relatively short, albeit, very gory (you may prefer to watch a different movie, if you happen to have a weak stomach). Instead, writer/director Frank Darabont (who also directed screen adaptations of two other Stephen King stories, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\"), focuses on the monsters inside the store, that is, the humans, in particular Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fundamentalist Christian who is even more dangerous than the monsters outside.     This is really a film about how humans behave in extreme situations. I read somewhere that one of Stephen King's favourite novels is \\"Lord of the Flies\\", and in a way, \\"The Mist\\" can be seen as being a variant on \\"Lord of the Flies\\", with adults rather than children. As with \\"Lord of the Flies\\", the message of this film is that if you take people out of their familiar surroundings and scare them enough, they will become savages - not exactly a message to restore your faith in humanity.     This is a very well made film, with acting that is, in general, excellent (give or take a couple of the supporting actors). It's not as good as \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", but few films are. I didn't particularly like the ending, but it is consistent with the general message ofthe film and I can accept Darabont's decision to end the film this way. Be warned however, that this is not a fun film. If you want a fun film about people being trapped in a shop by monsters, see the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a thoughtful, adult horror movie, then this is the way to go.

Maybe it is the success of<br />this album that made following Pink Floyd albums pale in comparison.<br />If you are new to Pink Floyd, this is the one album to have. Pour<br />yourself a toddie, turn the lights down a click, and hit the 'play'<br />button on the stereo....and enjoy!!
B0001I562I|4.0|This movie really brings me back to my childhood, it used to play on Disney all the time. It's about a kid who finds himself in a space ship piloted by a supe-cute robot (voiced by the fabulous Paul Reubens - aka Pee Wee Herman). This is a great family movie- appropriate and fun for kids and still enjoyable to adults. It's timeless. My father and I watched it together when I was growing up and now that it's out on DVD, I bought it for him so that he can enjoy it with my new baby brothers.   Definately pick this one up!
B000ULQV0W|4.0|The CD is pretty short, but each song rings clear and pure Eddie Vedder.  I haven't seen the film yet, but would like to see how the songs correlate to scenes.  I recommend this to any Pearl Jam and Vedder fans.
0671027344|4.0|I read this book for the first time many years ago and picked it up again recently. I was still struck by the emotional quality of the story and the way the reader is captured by the narrator despite the lack of much in the way of plot. It is essentially a coming of age story, a book about how one boy's life changes because of the friends he makes during his freshman year in high school. But he is a special boy, a fact that is eluded to throughout the book, but which doesn't really get resolved until the end. I found Charlie, the narrator, to be totally sympathetic, the kind of person you'd like to take care of, which is exactly right for the tone and theme of this book. The other thing I really admire about the book is the way that it doesn't stereotype characters, even though most of the people we meet are not fleshed out beyond moments and events that Charlie experiences. You don't have the dumb jock and the stuck up queen bee or anything like that; rather you get complicated teenagers, all of whom are struggling with their own unique stories as Charlie struggles with his. This book is sophisticated, challenging in subject matter, and emotionally complicated, but by the end, you feel so much for this character that you can't help but continue to think about him long after you've put the book down.
0060763892|5.0|I have immensely enjoyed all James Rollins action adventure books. The Judas Strain is another excellent adventure that I highly recommend you read it. If you like James Bond action and Indiana Jones adventure, you will enjoy The Judas Strain, as well as any James Rollins book. A James Rollins adventure is fast-paced with the action starting on the very first page and consistently continues throughout each book. The author combines 90% fact with imaginative 10% fiction creating an atmosphere of plausible mystery and suspense. All the main characters are well developed while in action. They are intelligent, resourceful, highly skilled and compassionate (at least the \\"good guys\\" are). Their narrow escapes from the many perilous situations are surprising, but credible. Plots take the reader all over the world, from beautiful historic sites to the darkest subterranean caverns, to reveal pieces of the intriguing yet unsolved puzzle and many side, but pertinent, mysteries. All books complete in a cataclysmic, action packed event, where the \\"good guys\\" barely, but credibly, escape with their lives. During the event, all mysteries are resolved and easily understood, allowing each book to stand on it own. I keep track and rate all the books I read on a scale from 1 to 10. For the nine James Rollins books I've read, the average is 9.3 and that's only because one of his first books rated 7. The last three books he's produced, which include The Judas Strain, I've rated 10! His books are so good, I've started rereading them, starting with the first one I read (and got hooked on), Ice Hunt.    Dr. Lisa Cummings and Monk Kokkalis of the secretive US government Sigma force are sent to investigate the mysterious death of marine life off an island in the Indian Ocean. They cover as WHO team members and the services of a \\"donated\\" luxury cruise ship is used as their center of operation. The cruise ship is commandeered by Sigma's nemesis Guild operatives, who want to use the disease asa bio-weapon, and Lisa is coerced into working for them to find the source and cure. At the same time, ex-Guild operative, perhaps turned good, Seichan crashes her motorcycle into Sigma's commander Gray Pierce's fourth of July party. Seichan has found a link of the deadly disease to Marco Polo's return trip to Venice from China in 1293 and wants Gray's help with the investigation. But the Guild is hot on Seichan's trail and captures her, Gray and Gray's parents, forcing her and Gray into helping the Guild follow this historic trail to the source and cure of the pestilence. The fast-paced action is non-stop and the perilous situations are numerous as Sigma tries to uncover the secrets of the past, but keep it out of the Guild's possession.
0321544080|5.0|I have been shooting for forty years and this is an inspiring book. Just one little tip was worth the price of the book to me. No, I'm not going to share that tip, buy the book as it is worth the price! I read this book cover-to-cover in one sitting. I just could not put it down. Joe shares tips and ideas on how he creates his images. Many of them were done on film but the same techniques can be applied to digital. His tips will help me reduce the time spent in Photoshop and spend more time creating images.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is an addictive game.  As soon as one game is finished you want to start another one, trying a different strategy each time.  You never have the same outcome twice.  It's a great game for all ages.  I have a 5 year old son that can play right along with the adults.  He's slowly learning strategy, but the visual geometric shapes are great for him to learn how pieces fit, sometimes by turning the piece the opposite way of how he wanted to play it.  It's all a learning game, for adults and children.  I highly recommend it.  I gave 4 stars for durability only because the pieces look like they could be snapped apart if they got into the wrong hands!!
B00001U0E1|4.0|\\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is a wonderful film, but might have been even more wonderful with two different actors in the leading roles.  This is particularly true of the film's leading lady, the highly overrated Gwyneth Paltrow.  Without her bleached blonde hair, anorexic frame, and famous theatrical parents (who were close friends of people like Steven Spielberg, who gave Paltrow her first part), no one would ever have looked at Paltrow, who brings this film down several notches with her glaring inferiority to the rest of the cast.  She produces her English accent by overlaying her unpleasantly nasal voice with constant breathiness, and ends up sighing her lines most of the time; she indicates high emotion by wrinkling her eyebrows and bobbing her chin in and out - this barely competent actress gets by here due to the reflected glow of REAL talent, i.e., people like Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson, Judy Dench, Rupert Everett (in a marvelous turn as Marlowe, Shakespeare's rival) and others who really CAN act.  Even the limited Ben Affleck does better (although only a bit better) than Paltrow does with her Pretensions to High Falutin' British-Type Acting.  Spare me references to the Oscar that Paltrow got for this role: this is the same Academy that gave Tommy Lee Jones Best Supporting Actor for his work in \\"The Fugitive\\" over the performance of Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi concentration camp commandant in \\"Schindler's List\\" (heck, Fiennes's performance only shows up regularly on critics' lists of \\"Ten Best Screen Performances by an Actor Ever\\" - yeah, we'll ALL remember the far superior work Tommy Lee Jones did in that great epic, \\"The Fugitive\\"!) So much for Paltrow's Oscar.    And speaking of Fiennes, Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's younger brother), decently talented and handsome enough, does better than his leading lady - but he lacks the spark that would make you care.  The result is that the supporting cast in this film is far superior to the two leads and far moreinteresting to watch.  Geoffrey Rush, in fact, totally walks off with this film, just as he nearly walked off with \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\".  One can only imagine what \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" might have been like with a young Cate Blanchett (or even Keira Knightley) as Viola de Lessup and, say, a young Gary Oldman as the Bard.    Well, it was not to be, but in the meantime, what we have here is a highly entertaining two hours of speculation on how \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (and \\"Twelfth Night\\") might have come to be written, based on a witty script that incorporates sly digs at the social mores of Elizabethan England, life in the theater in ANY era, and modern culture, as well, all brought to you via Tom Stoppard.    The film revolves around the star-crossed romance between a youthful Shakespeare and one Lady Viola de Lessup, and the evolution of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" as Shakespeare transfers the ups and downs of his romance with de Lessup onto the page, and thence to the stage. Shakespeare, of course, was married by the time he wrote \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", but even had he not been, the social gulf between a \\"hired player\\" and a titled lady would have made this match impossible. So, the film follows the two, as Shakespeare pours their hopeless love into his latest play, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".  It's not exactly the first time this structure has been done, but it works as well here as it ever has.    As the film opens, the Bard is having a bit of writer's block as he struggles to write the next play he has promised Rush, who owns one of the two rival theaters operating in London.  Rush is already in hock up to his eyebrows to a merciless moneylender (Tom Wilkinson) and desperately needs a hit play.  As Shakespeare wrestles with writer's block, Lady Viola de Lessup (Paltrow), only child of a wealthy businessman, is being cased as a suitable bride with a large dowry by the noble but poor Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), with an eye to recouping his fortunes in the tobacco fields of the New World.  But Viola is stagestruck and in love with the theater, and has no eyes for a socially brilliant match.  She longs to go on stage herself, but even if her social status did not preclude it, the law of the land at the time did not allow women to act onstage - it was thought lewd, and women's roles were played by men and boys, with ingenue parts going to young boys whose voices had not yet broken.    Needless to say, the plays of Will Shakespeare come to Lady Viola's attention, and Lady Viola comes to Shakespeare's attention at a party at her father's house, and before you know it, Lady Viola has dressed up in boys' clothing and auditioned for and won a role in Shakespeare's latest play, and soon the playwright finds out that his new play's leading man is actually the woman he fell madly in love with at first sight, and then - enter Lord Wessex, whose offer for the hand of Lady Viola has been accepted by her father, and the match approved by a (somewhat stagestruck heself) Queen Elizabeth I (Judi Dench). . .well, you get the drift.    The sub-plots and vagaries of life in the theater and the central love story are expertly woven together, the script is relentlessly witty and includes merry references to some of the earthier aspects of life in Elizabethan England, as well as plenty of backstage backbiting, quarreling, sex, and intrigue.  Jokes on the Bard's most famous lines abound - meant, of course, to impress upon modern audiences just how thoroughly Shakespeare's influence still permeates our culture and language.    The film is beautifully photographed, and, with the exception of Paltrow and Affleck, who seem to have wandered onto the wrong set, the cast is so marvellous that you can't help enjoying yourself.  Two leading actors on the level of the rest of the cast would have gotten this film another star, but even with its flawed leads, \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is fast, funny, and delightful.
B000002UVX|5.0|I just saw the Grammy's 08 and it never ceases to dawn on me..the naive hopeful side of me..why can't we hear some good friggin music these days? I'm not as hopeless and naive as to think there isn't any. Matter fact there's tons..but people, we need some mainstream exposure on the goodness out there(there were a couple good ones..one guitar folky chick and maybe Amy Winehouse. at the Grammy's), lest our children grow up to believe in nothing but the music video. ..but what about talent?..aahhh, forget it. This kind of rant is now cliche, has been for some time, forgive me amazon..time to move on.    Anyways, OK..onto what keeps me hopeful. I could review each song here but I'll just keep it simple.  I don't think a day passes without me listening some Machine Gun. I listen to it in the morning usually, before work. I think it to be the greatest guitar solo ever.. causing an eargasm with facial muscle spasms ...and then its off to another another day at the job. What I really would like to know is what Jimi was thinking at the time he bagan the solo part..was it..\\"Damn, I'm gonna tear this muuutha,\\" or maybe, \\"Hmm, I hope we're having stove top for dinner tonight.\\" Either way, a must for anyone interested in some good heartfelt grooves that will make you shake your neck bone until your good soul chimmeys down your right leg and exits out your shoe until you pass it on like they used to say. Share it with your kids.

It also has a great clip of the Who doing \\"A quick one while he is away\\" on the Rolling Stones Circus show in the late 60's or early 70's. It is an great video.
B00005JPLW|5.0|For a movie adapted from a graphic novel (comic) that was an adaptation of ancient events...well...what can you say? This movie is one of the best when compared to other comic -> movie creations. The action, story, cast and special effects were all made for the big screen. It looses a little coming down TV size but still well worth it. For those people with big screen TV, plasma or projectors you will enjoy showing off your equipment with this movie. The detail is fantastic.  It is a violent movie and not recommended for young children.  Teenagers will love it and probably make wooden swords and break their fingers in mock clashes after watching it...yes, it's that kind of movie.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|After watching this DVD, you have to ask yourself,\\"How the heck was the first cut of the movie ever allowed out and why don't they destroy it?\\"  This edition ties together all of the missing links that for me, made the original unbearable. With this cut, Scott has a masterpiece. Simply an unbelievable achievement. In the original, my take of Orlando Bloom was to keep questioning how such an underwhelming actor could have such a part? In the restoration, Bloom finally mixes in correctly with the story, and the story itself gets tied together. If you found the original ok, but were left scratching your head, this is your answer. SPECTACULAR. Does it sound like a liked this version?
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When Rocky started spinning off sequels I lost count of which ones I saw, but Rocky Balboa is a different story, and a fitting conclusion to the saga. What makes this one different is the soul of the story that seems nearer to the original film than any of the numbered serials. In a fantasy matchup, pundits predict how the current heavyweight champion would fare against the has-been Rocky. On a level playing field, the two would be well-matched. When Rocky entertains the idea of getting back into the ring, he contends with himself, more than everything else. Who is he doing it for? What is he trying to prove? Why does it matter?<br /><br />What emerges is a touching story of man's triumph of self-respect. Stallone brings depth to a character who wants to carve out a legacy for himself, while coming to terms with the hopes, disapointments, and dreams of  a lifetime. DVD includes outtakes and an alternate ending that works, but you realize the one they chose is fitting and gives resonance to a well-told conclusion to the Rocky saga.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Zodiac could well be the best film of 2007. As far as movies about serial killers go, David Fincher might find that with this and Se7en, he has earned both second and third place, paying homage to his master, Hitchcock, who retains first place with his cross-dressing shower murderer.<br /><br />Avid enthusiasts of the Zodiac case will find this movie faithful in many departments and it does try to reveal the executioner which is impressive for a serial killer movie about a slaughterer that was never caught... well at least officially. Fincher implicates one of the possible suspects beyond a doubt so we do find closure.<br /><br />However, Zodiac is more than just a serial killer movie. It is about obsession and how it destroys lives. The film leaves you wondering, who is more obsessed and deluded? The serial killer who stalks victims for media fame, or the cartoonist turned wannabe detective who abandons his family and fills his rooms with boxes of files instead of his kids. In a memorable scene which describes the vast time periods involved (the film spans over 20 years) his kids know the ins and outs of the case better than some detectives do.<br /><br />This is well made, well acted film that also looks great. Fincher is never shy to the make the most of his cinematography. Even the overhead car tracking shots reveal that Fincher has still got tricks up his sleeve. The lighting, like in Se7en, is impeccable. Zodiac has some of highest production values that you can find in any contemporary classic.<br /><br />Overall the Zodiac is a must see for the high pace suspense. So much goes on in so little time you should feel the urge to watch it again. When films do that, they give you a reason to own it. Fincher makes films that people with brains want to see.<br /><br />In an era gone by when teen lovers are either slashed by dream demons with razor fingers or bludgeoned by a guy in a hockey mask (insert clown mask also), there is nothing more terrifying than the thought of a guy who breathes heavy on the end of the phone or calls in to a chat show to discuss his little problem of knifing up women while denying that his over-the-air shrieks from beyond this dimension are anything other than just his headache.end of the phone or calls in to a chat show to discuss his little problem of knifing up women while denying that his over-the-air shrieks from beyond this dimension are anything other than just his headache.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for \\"Across the Universe\\" I was pretty sure that I was going to like it.  I have dozens and dozens of covers of Beatles songs, having put together playlists for each of the Beatles albums, in many instances having been able to find cover versions of all of the songs on a particular album.  Also, in my youth, I contemplated a stage musical that would use the songs of Stevie Nicks to tell the story of the Welsh witch Rhiannon, so I appreciate the inclination.  Besides, with 200-plus Beatles songs, the problem would not be finding enough songs for an entire musical but rather drawing a line and getting the finished movie in at under 2 hours.<br /><br />I would have said that using the music of the Beatles as the soundtrack for a movie is a fool proof idea, but that was because I was taking the idea at face value and had forgotten about \\"[[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]].\\"  Then I remember that \\"[[ASIN:B000066HAS I am Sam]]\\" used contemporary covers of Beatles songs, but that example is really not on point since they are used in the background, the way Simon & Garfunkle's songs were used in \\"[[ASIN:B00079Z9VO The Graduate]].\\"  \\"Across the Universe\\" is a more traditional musical, even if it is, in Roger Ebert's memorable phrase, a musical \\"where we walk into the theater humming the songs.\\"<br /><br />Before we are a minute into this 2007 movie I knew it was going to work, as soon as Jude (Jim Sturgess), sitting on a stormy beach, turns to the camera and sings: \\"Is there anybody going to listen to my story, All about the girl who came to stay?\\"  I was reminded of the beginning of \\"[[ASIN:B000060OFT William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet]]\\" when the newscaster does the whole \\"Two households, both alike in dignity...\\" prologue and I knew this \\"modern\\" version was going to work.  It is not often when a movie is able to convince you in the prologue that it is going to work, but when it does (e.g., \\"[[ASIN:B00003CX8Y Beauty and the Beast]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle]]\\"), you tend to remember them.<br /><br />Because the characters all have names from Beatles songs, from Jude and Lucy to Sadie, Jo-Jo, and Prudence, there is an expectation that the songs from which they get their names are all going to pop up during the proceedings (or the end credits).  But that does not prove to be the case.  Sometimes a single line from a song pops up, so Beatles fans need to pay attention even when characters are not singing.  The plot is basic boy (Sturgess's Jude) meets girl (Evan Rachel Wood's Lucy), boy loses girl, on to the requisite happy ending, played out against the turmoil of the 1960s, which means the War in Vietnam, the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the like.  Part of the fun is seeing the new contexts in which these familiar songs pop up, both in terms of the times, as with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" and \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\\" and in terms of relationships, like with \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\"<br /><br />Julie Taymor previously directed \\"[[ASIN:B000E6ESKS Titus]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B00005JLPK Frida]],\\" it is not surprising to those relatively few souls who have seen both of those films that she pulls this one off.  A major treat here is seeing how Taymor makes specific lyrics work so well, from the \\"Won't you come out and play\\" from \\"Dear Prudence\\" to the \\"Jude, Judee, Judee\\" part of \\"Hey, Jude,\\" and even a \\"duh\\" moment when she works in \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\"  I can also add to the list the nice use of the final chord from \\"A Day in the Life.\\"<br /><br />The cast are relative unknowns, with Evan Rachel Wood the most familiar fact (but when Taymor suggests on the bonus disc that nobody knew Wood culd sing I have to respond that everybody who saw the final episode of the second season of \\"[[ASIN:B0009F43FY Once and Again]],\\" where Wood sang \\"Red Red Robin\\" after the wedding was well aware Wood can sing).  It says something of the quality of the singing if I say that Wood might be the weakest vocalist in the cast and I have no complaints regarding what she does on .  Dana Fuchs' Sadie was my overall favorite, belting out \\"Helter Skelter,\\" \\"Oh, Darling,\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\\"  But I could listen to Sturgess sing just anything, and it was great to have Joe Cocker show up for \\"Come Together.\\"  Some of my favorite parts here are the harmonies, most notably on the gorgeous version of \\"Because\\" the cast sings laying en masse in a field.<br /><br />Yes, I know all of the songs are available on the [[ASIN:B000WCBPOG soundtrack]], and that is fine for driving around in the car, but listening to these songs on the DVD is way better.

I usually love British humor so I was really looking forward to reading this book.  Perhaps the British version is funnier, or I missed some of the jokes, being American, or some of the jokes may have been lost in translation for the American market.  I will definitely give other Gaiman and Pratchett books a chance, but this one did not meet my expectations.  It gets a 3 stars for keeping me entertained, the unique perspective, and the interesting ideas about religion and spirituality.

B000VBJEEG|2.0|After hearing great things about this movie I was pretty excited to see it. I like Brad Bird and have certainly enjoyed Pixar's offerings before. I checked the rating to make sure I could watch it with my 5 year old niece and was pleased to see it was G. We popped it in the player and sat down to watch. Well, when you're watching a movie with a 5 year old, you tend to see things from that 5 year old's perspective. And I have to say this movie should have been rated PG. Not that there was anything horribly traumitizing about it, my niece didn't have nightmares or anything. However, it required a great deal of explanation and guidance. Hence, it should have been rated PG- Parental Guidance. I expect a G rated movie to be something that doesn't require blow by blow explanations of everything that's going on. My niece had a hard time following the complicated story and I had a hard time caring about it. The animation was nice, but nothing special. Also, I found the gun-toting, gas-masked granny to be way over the top and somewhat frightening for young children. My niece did not like that part at all. I had meant to watch this again without my niece to see if I would have a clearer perspective, but I couldn't work up the enthusiasm for a second viewing. Had it for a week and only watched it once.<br />I wouldn't recommend this movie for young children. As for everyone else . . . it's your hour and 51 minutes.

B0000549B0|5.0|As a child when I would hear an unexplained noise in our house my mother would say it was Harvey. Not knowing any better, I thought that it was her way of easing my discomfort and it worked. It wasn't until I became an adult that I realized she was referring to the movie, and when I finally saw Harvey I adored it.  As a lover of classic movies, I believe this is one of James Stewart's finest roles.  It's zany, but so much fun. He makes his invisible rabbit so believable and his supporting cast is fabulous. This is a movie every child should see.

B000ZIXGFS|4.0|WOW!!!!!Sweet Baby Jesus!!!!!!!! THANK GOD Rock and Roll is still alive.  This is a very good CD but, with all due respect, they're no Black Sabbath or Pink Floyd. They sound more like a the Jefferson Starship meet Patti Smith.  They would be extremely at home in the late 60s as their music has that West Coast psychedelic flavor. This is very groovy, simple(musically and lyrically) but multidimensional sonic fair.  No two songs sound the same, but the entire CD flows so well that it has a psychedelic feel when listened to in it's entirety. The whole CD is good but the songs Night Walks, Queens Will Play and Bright Lights KILLLLLLLLLL!!!! Amber Webber has the voice of a GODDESS!!! But, if you're into Black Sabbath (heavy/doom metal) you'll be wondering why, of all bands, they're comparing Black Mountain with them.  But if you're into late 60s psychedelic rock, you'll LOVE this CD.

Anyone who needs to spend several months in seclusion thinking of no one but themselves has got bigger...well, I'll leave it at that.  And I was somehow disappointed that she got involved in a relationship & got married in the final third of the book - totally defeats the purpose of the journey and in my opinion put her back at square one.  I was hoping for more of a travel memoir, and less of an ego-centric rant.

0143038419|5.0|I was sorely disappointed to see far too many negative reviews for this book. I found Eat Pray Love to be a very interesting and fabulous book. The author writes the book from a very personal perspective and so YES it does come across as a little self centered, but how could you not come across this way when you are talking about your own personal spiritual journey. The entire premise of the book is that she is taking one year off from her life to focus on herself!   In my own reality I know that I will most likely never get the opportunity to spend an entire year just trying to figure out who I am, so I was pleased to go on Elizabeth's journey instead. It was written in a self depreciating humor that made it easy to like Elizabeth and connect with her struggles. She never tries to claim that her life is so much more difficult than anyone else's; it's just her life and she has to deal with it.   One reviewer wrote about the author's \\"endless reflection on the horror of a marriage that didn't seem that horrible to me\\". This completely misses the point. The author gives you a little background as to what set her off into this year long spiritual journey and the end of her marriage represented the moment when she decided to stop walking the path society expected her to and to start walking her own path. Her ex-husband could have been the greatest guy in the world, it just didn't matter because being a suburban mom wasn't the path she needed to take. Her marriage is a representation of society and family obligations. Unsurprisingly it takes her some time to get over leaving behind what was expected of her and being comfortable doing the unexpected. Ultimately being comfortable in her own skin and all of us being comfortable in our own skin is the message this book conveyed to me. I found it an enriching experience I would love to repeat again and again.

This album is incredible. Say what you want but I'll get this album when it turns 30. I'll get it when it turns 50. I don't care. Michael is the man!!!
1400063515|4.0|Nissim Taleb has a great point about \\"Black Swan\\" events (the unexpected or highly improbable) and the unpredictable nature of many major events.  However, the book is quite lengthy and I found it repetitive going over what seemed to be the same points over and over.    Don't get me wrong - there are still some great concepts here and people do tend to try to fit things into patterns, feel overconfident about our control or ability to manage often what are incontrollable random events, and we all need to be aware of our inability to predict the future to any reliable degree.  It is a worthwhile read - you might just be wishing though it came in a slightly more condensed version.
0553589059|5.0|Elizabeth Bear's Undertow (a Philip K. Dick award finalist) is the book that fulfilled what I want in a book - it crystallized my amorphous ideas about what I wanted and literally showed me - it's eyeball-popping finale really melded the book into a cohesive whole, tied up the loose ends, and gave me the thrill I needed. As an author, she has always satisfied me (her Jenny Casey trilogy), but in this book she was in top form - it's semi-mystical beginnings, unsavory characters, and odd, Louisiana Bayou Company Town setting, plus a very unusual alien species, made the beginning questionable - what have I gotten my self into? Were Hammered, Scardown, and Worldwired a fluke - was that all she had? Well, Undertow answered that with a resounding NO!    One thing that stood out was that she used a different type of future - a non-Singularity future, which I enjoyed. So much SF these days, when dealing with the Far Future, uses that. But it is filled with lots of high-tech - wearables, the connex mentioned. Basically everyone, except a few who chose to live \\"off the grid\\" so to speak, are completely wired in - they get instant news, houses are responsive and security runs high. And the way the whole city/town can just pick up and move is sooo different. Even the aliens are (the information is dribbled out over the course of the novel) inventive and use all the possible elements that can be done - nothing about them are giant lizards, or talking trees.    There has been some negative comparisons to The Secret, because, as she is not a quantum engineer, her explanations of some of it's aspects used in the book are minimal - but as both a Hard SF nutcase, AND an under science-educated reader, it hit a chord - I loved not being overwhelmed with technical detail, but still be able to \\"follow\\" the idea behind the quantum theory, which is one of the reasons I got into Hard SF - Baxter's Manifold: Space was full of mind-boggling stuff, and although I didn't understand it all, I didn't have to - the mere idea that these things exist, or are theorized to exist, is enough to set your world on end.     Some reviews have focused on the use of the probability futures, and it's cursory explanations - they want more detail. I, on the other hand, don't need that - I just need the author to set me on the path, and get me fired up, and off I go. I LIKE not being in a lecture hall, but instead, given ideas that make me THINK, and want to run to my nearest Hawking book, or other QM one, and do some research on my own. Too much detail strays the story off it's path, IMO.    Undertow set the bar quite high for me, which is probably why I've been so hard on A Fire Upon the Deep by Vinge. This book makes the others look amateurish, dull, wordy and unimaginative. Undertow accomplishes in it's short (368) pages, what AFUTD (624) couldn't do in almost twice the length.    I urge you to give it a try - if you've read the Casey trilogy, it's nothing like it. This is NOT your grandmother's book. It's cool, mysterious, shadowy, full of fun, capers, plots and counter-plots, treason and treachery, and all set within an incredibly complex setting, more so as the book goes on, and as I have repeatedly said, the push to the ending is enough to make you think your trippin'.    So, do me and yourself a favor - if you like fresh, new, exciting, genre -bending SF/Fantasy (SFF), then read it. Support your local SF writer! If you prefer your SF to remain in it's cozy, set genre, then don't.     Have a wild ride (and stay on the horse - it might want to buck you off at first, but if you persevere, and are the kind of reader I mentioned, then the ride will be one worth all you've given it).

6305718954|5.0|A young woman Frankie Paige (Arquette) suddenly starts showing in her skin and experiences the extreme pain and bleeding of the marks and skin lacerations of Christ at the time when he was being tortured and crucified. It isn't long before she catches the attention of Father Kiernan( Gabriel Byrne) the low key Vatican chief investigator of such cases. However Cardinal Houseman ( Jonathan Pryce) who initially sends Kiernan to investigate,comes to the conclusion that public exposure of Frankie's agony could cause great harm or even destroy the Church and engages in a plot to silence  Frankie Paige (Arquette) forever. Kiernan becomes aware of Houseman's sinister plan and must race against time to stop him from achieving his misguided and destructive goal and to save the girl's life.  This film shows and deals the phenomena allegedly experienced by some in different parts of the world, its name \\"Stigmata\\". To me it carries a powerful message that no one is immune to this phenomena, including those with little or no religious faith. To me its an eye opener.  Superbly well acted. In my opinion, so far, Gabriel Byrne's most memorable role.
B000XO2R1S|1.0|I've enjoyed Herbie Hancock's music in the past.  Naturally when this album won Album of The Year at the Grammy's, I figured it was a sure thing, must have for my collection.  I bought it without previewing the songs.  There was not even one song on the album that I liked even a little bit.    Lesson learned:  Don't ever let an award make you forego what you normally do to decide if an album is worth purchasing.  Always listen to the samples first.
0345350499|2.0|After enough years of being told by various friends that I should read this book I finally did so over a long break. While it was vaguely interesting enough to hold my attention until the end (with a lot of skim reading and skipping around) I did not find it to be the life affirming, Goddess invoking be-all-and-end-all novel that so many have found it to be. I mean, have they not made it all the way to the end? By the time the tome draws itself to a conclusion, all of the \\"evil Christians\\" have been absolved and the \\"pious pagans\\" brought to shame and obscurity. Huh. I don't get the hype.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|***1/2 2005. Written and directed by Joss Whedon. Earned the 2006 Hugo award. The crew of the spaceship Serenity tries to unveil a secret well hidden by the alliance. A little well-paced sci-fi movie for the youngsters and the less young. One can only regret that the screenplay of this B movie borrows more than its share ideas already seen in George Lucas' [[ASIN:B00003CXCT Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)]], John Carpenter's [[ASIN:B00003CY6P Ghosts of Mars (Special Edition)]] and Paul Verhoeven's [[ASIN:B000OVLBHG Starship Troopers]].
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie was a very creative approach to a musical, and by stringing all the Beatles' songs together, they actually made a legitimate story line that everyone can relate to one some level or another (even if we weren't all a bunch of hippies during Vietnam!).  The cover makes it look a little cheesy, but it actually is very touching and inspiring.
0446677450|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\\" After reading this book I've come to realize a couple of things: my whole mentality, whether I knew it or not, was to become a middle class professional which meant being stuck in what the book calls \\"the rat race.\\" I also realized that, if I didn't read this book, I probably would have missed out on one of the most important and useful knowledge I could acquire, financial intelligence.     I do not necessarily wish to make millions of dollars, but I do aspire to get out of the \\"rat race.\\" I want to learn more about controlling my personal finances, investing in real estate and the money market. I want to get out of debt. I want to improve myself in all aspects; mind, body and soul. Finally, I want to share my experience with my family so that they may also realize what I've realized through reading this book. I feel that reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" was the stepping stone for all this. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book.

B00000G3I2|5.0|THE BIG CHILL is one of the few movies that I own, and I will watch it periodically and still be entertained. Lawrence Kasdan is a brilliant movie maker whose projects invite viewers to question their values. Although this movie provokes thought, the clever dialogue is pure fun.<br /><br />I believe THE BIG CHILL was one of the first--if not, THE first--movies that let the music tell a part of the story. And since this comfortable group of friends danced together in the kitchen while preparing dinner, many other movies have included a gratuitous dance scene.<br /><br />This movie was a first to feature an ensemble cast whose sum is greater than its parts. Every part is memorable and clever, but no one overshadows anyone else.<br /><br />Most people--of a certain age--know that THE BIG CHILL was to be a vehicle for Kevin Costner toward the beginning of his career. Instead, Costner's body was featured in the role of the friend who dies at the beginning of the story, and prompts a reunion of friends who once shared similar values.<br /><br />This movie is fun, quirky, clever, and sweet. And unlike other movies, the selection of music is strategically placed within the dialogue and plot to help move the story forward.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to all adults of any age. I tried to add five stars. This should have five stars.
0321544080|5.0|I have a shelves of \\"how to\\" photo books ranging from macro photography to how to use my Canon Tilt and Shift lens.    None were bad, but none were great reading until now. Joe McNally has broken the code combing an eminently readable book that is packed with coffee table quality images and detailed instructions on how the images were shot.  But more than this he gives humorous insights about the life and business of being a professional photographer.    You will learn what it takes to rent an elephant and if elephant models get overtime. And what went in to producing a shot of Kermit the Frog after the tragic death of his creator.    Joe is a master at using light. He stresses numerous times that the word Photography comes from the Greek and means Light Writing.     He goes well beyond the use of light and lighting equipment. How to get the shot involves more than light. We get to climb into Joe's creative processes and see how he makes the iconic images he is famous for.    There is no artistic pretension found in so many other books of this type.    If you are not a photographer you will love the images contained in the book. If you are a photographer it will show you how to be better.

B000002J20|4.0|The infamous album that killed progressive rock. Okay, it wasn't the sole catalyst - other progressive releases from the '73-'74 period, such as A Passion Play, Brain Salad Surgery and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway also contributed to the genre's downfall. But I think this one took more heat than any of those three, because it's a four song double album, and you know what that means. That's right, four sidelong pieces. But from a 2008 perspective, it's held up quite well. I'll grant it's not an easy one to get into. It's not as action-packed as the similarly ambitious Close to the Edge, arguably their high point, there are very few hooks, and the lyrics mean nothing. But the mood this thing sets is pretty hard to beat. Something you must remember about Yes is that they are (or at minimum were at this point) absolute masters of mood. Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe create beautiful textures. It's a very carefully produced album, a soundscape of sorts. There are large portions on this album that are kind of uneventful the first time you hear them, but now that I've dug deeper into it I can greatly appreciate the gorgeous keyboard passages found on \\"The Remembering: High the Memory\\". The tempo changes are cool, too. Even better than any of that, though, is the surprising guitar solo after a very spacey part. But getting back to the keyboards, Rick Wakeman is pretty much all over the entire first disc of this, actually, since he also plays heavily on \\"The Revealing Sciences of God: Dance of the Dawn\\", which is pretty similar to \\"The Remembering\\", which automatically means it rules as well.  Which is good, because I'm a Rick Wakeman fan, and he, his cape, and his 65 different keyboards are all at their creative peaks here. As I said before, Steve Howe plays some sweet guitars all over the place too. So if the first album/CD/LP/two songs/ whatever was the \\"Rick Wakeman half\\", the last album/CD/LP/two songs/whatever is the \\"Steve Howe half\\". I love that funky riffing he does at the start of \\"The Ancient: Giants Under the Sun\\" so much that I don't even notice there's four minutes of it. The jumpy, erm... first vocal section is good too, but the rest of the song can never match up to that first part, which I think is my favorite part of the album, though I also like Wakeman' symphonic keyboard solo. And pretty much every other guitar solo during the song, especially the acoustic one. That is brilliant! To make things better, Chris Squire plays some great bass on that one. Here's a complaint I have, about this one, though: Chris gets buried. Jon, Steve, Rick, and Alan White dominate, and sadly Chris, a fantastic bassist (as you can hear on the previous three studio records) is buried in the mix. So \\"The Ancients\\" is my favorite song on the whole record, because there isn't a single wasted minute in it (unlike the other three, which probably could've used a bit of cleaning up - and by \\"a bit\\", I mean \\"a couple minutes\\"). Howe also plays a brilliant lead on \\"Ritual: Nous Sommes Du Soleil\\", which has this chant that qualifies as the only truly catchy moment on the record. Yay catchiness! It is a bit annoying how there's a quote from Close to the Edge on it, though. I mean, if you're gonna rip off one of your own most famous songs, I assure you other people will laugh at you for being a self rip-off guy. Yes, I know, that was a fearsome display of vocabulary. So as \\"Ritual\\" winds on, they whip out a sitar, and it sounds really cool. Then as the song (which is way too long, I'll add) progresses, there's a drum solo tacked on for no good reason at all. Seriously, it doesn't make an ounce of sense. But it's good. I guess. That doesn't keep the song from being about five minutes longer than necessary, though. And then they get to that \\"avant-garde\\" [...], and it just turns annoying. Nobody wants to hear that! Thankfully, it ends, and it's back to more Rick Wakeman goodness, with a beautiful piano. After that, the lyrics finally kick in. Now here'sanother problem I have with this album: I have no interest in the lyrics whatsoever. It's based on some Far East text - Autobiography of a Yogi, I believe - and Jon takes up way too much space babbling about it. I mean, his voice sounds nice, but it would've been better if he either sang nonsense syllables, thought up a set of lyrics people could actually relate to, or just didn't sing at all. That, coupled with the fact that I could've done without ten minutes of this whole thing, keeps it from getting a higher score. But it's a good album. And I love the cover art! Probably my favorite YesCover. Or Yesshows, or possibly Relayer.another problem I have with this album: I have no interest in the lyrics whatsoever.

B0009V1GDK|4.0|Doubtlessly the most famous and influential album of the '90s. If you honestly don't know the story behind it, here's how it goes: Nirvana kicked around for a while under several different names in the late '80s, going through several personnel changes before deciding on a lineup of Kurt Cobain (guitar/vocals), Krist Novoselic (bass) and Chad Channing (drums) getting signed on a minor label in 1988 and putting out their debut album, Bleach (famously recorded for $600) in 1989. Most people don't own it.<br />Somewhere in the interim, Nirvana picked up Dave Grohl, signed with Geffen records, and enlisted producer Butch Vig to work on their second album, Nevermind. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was released as the lead-off single, meant to get Nirvana across to the coveted college radio market. The hope was that the follow-up single \\"Come As You Are\\" would cross Nirvana over to a mainstream audience. Maybe, just maybe, they would be a moderately popular group.<br />Next thing the group knew, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was a worldwide smash, Nevermind was riding high on the charts and taking home all kinds of critical acclaim, and hair metal was dying out. Suddenly, the world of rock would never be the same again. If it weren't for this, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, and pretty much every other popular American rock group from the era you could name probably wouldn't have anywhere near the success they enjoy now. Cobain was a celebrity, and Butch Vig became huge in his own right - he went on to produce another '90s milestone, Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream.<br />So I just spent three paragraphs giving history. You're probably wondering what the album's like. Well, on a whole it's good. The singles are fantastic: \\"Teen Spirit\\"'s wall of loud, distorted, but melodic guitars, dynamic shifts, and massive chorus have made it an anthem for children of the '90s such as me; \\"Come As You Are\\" matches a watery bass riff with intelligent lyrics about stardom; \\"In Bloom\\" is a biting criticism of brain-dead rock fans with a brilliant video and pounding drums; and my favorite, \\"Lithium\\", cross-breeds a surprisingly jazzy rhythm, disturbing lyrics, and a giant emotional release in the refrain. And it's not just the singles, either. There's a string of fine rockers - \\"Breed\\", \\"Drain You\\", \\"Lounge Act\\", \\"On a Plain\\" - a stark, controversial sex abuse protest, \\"Polly\\" (creepiest lyric: \\"Polly says her back hurts, and she's just as bored as me\\"), and my friend's favorite, the mesmeric, gently swaying ballad \\"Something in the Way\\". Plus the pure mayhem of the hidden track, \\"Endless Nameless\\" (with Kurt giving us such insightful proclamations as \\"YEEAREARH!!!\\" and \\"BLAAARGH!\\") is awesome. Dave and Krist provide steady backing and really step up to the plate on tracks like \\"In Bloom\\" (Dave), \\"Lounge Act\\" (Krist), and \\"Lithium\\" (both of 'em). And Kurt's sense of melody never deserts him. But some of it is weak. Sure, when I'm in the mood I can relate to the pure anger of \\"Stay Away\\" (with a frightening chorus), but other times it just bores me. And I don't like \\"Territorial P***ings\\" at all. It's bad, just about unlistenable in fact.<br />Virtually everyone knows what happened next: Nirvana put out one album (In Utero, which in my opinion is the group's masterpiece), then Kurt killed himself. Which is a shame, because I would've loved to have met him. I read an interview with him, and he struck me as a caring, down-to-earth guy genuinely interested in music, rather than money. He actually detested this album because of its production, which he thought was too commercial. Plus he didn't want racists, sexists or homophobes buying his records, which kicks total butt in my mind, especially when you consider how many rock stars are racists, sexists or homophobes themselves (or all three, in the case of that wonderful, gentlemanly philanthropist Axl Rose).<br />In conclusion, Nevermind is a fine album- Motley Crue, Bon Jovi and Poison combined couldn't make anything a fraction as good. But there are better in the Nirvana catalog. This is probably the most accessible of their albums, but I'd recommend you get In Utero as well, since as I said I think it's a far better album, though it's also REALLY harsh and noisy. Unplugged in New York is also a classic, tied with Bob Marley's Babylon By Bus as my favorite live album of all time. So while Nevermind isn't a bad purchase by any means, you could do much better. If you like this album's sound, I'd also point you towards Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Bandmotorfinger and Superunknown, Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream, Stone Temple Pilots' Core and Purple, Alice in Chains' Dirt, and several others I can't think of right now. The early '90s were a great era for rock music, probably better than anything but the classic 1965-1975 epoch, and while this is the definitive album of the time period, it's pretty far from the best.n Jovi and Poison combined couldn't make anything a fraction as good.

B000000W5L|5.0|I'll begin by echoing what some other reviewers have mentioned: this is a terrific Rolling Stones album (actually, when released, it was a two album set), but without a lot of great singles on it. But that may be a part of why this is such a good work.  There is rawness throughout the set of songs--and raggedness.  It has an earthy rock and roll/blues sensibility and it works because of its rawness, as opposed to despite its rawness. One characteristic, too, is how difficult it is sometimes to make out the words to the songs (there is a famous quotation attributed to Mick Jagger that this was intentional at times).<br /><br />The CD begins with two flat out neat rockers--\\"Rocks Off\\" and \\"Rip This Joint.\\"  Jagger growls and the band plays with a hard edge to it. Then, to one of the gems--the Stones' version of Slim Harpo's great blues number, \\"Shake Your Hips.\\"  Jagger sings it differently from Harpo, but he is effective in his own way. The Stones show that they can play blues well (and note a later piece on \\"Exile,\\" once recorded by Robert Johnson himself, \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\").<br /><br />One of the few \\"hits\\" off this work, \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" well played here.  Some interesting features: Jagger on guitar and Mick Taylor on bass.  Then, \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" which, if my memory serves me correctly (please correct me if I'm in error), was inspired by activist Angela Davis. A catchy hook and tune.  \\"Ventilator Blues\\" seems to focus on a bad hair day, with one line being \\"I feel like murder in the first degree.\\"  This is a down and dirty song, with some gritty instrumental work.<br /><br />One of Keith Richards' earlier solos shows up here, the up tempo \\"Happy,\\" featuring a nice guitar riff to start the song off, presumably Mick Taylor's work.  And \\"Exile on Main Street\\" concludes with \\"Soul Survivor,\\" a lively song featuring some guitar work and nice keyboards.  Jagger's voice is ragged and, because of this, quite effective in the context of the entire CD.<br /><br />The Stones near or at the pinnacle of their career--Jagger on vocals, Taylor and Richards on guitar, Wyman on bass, Watts on drums.  \\"Friends\\" showing up: Keys on sax, Price on horns, Hopkins on piano, Stewart (an old Stone himself) on piano, and so on.

The film incorporates over 30 songs from The Beatles into its story and is loaded with endless references to other Beatles' songs and associated lore.  As a tribute the film is outstanding.  As a film it is as visually beautiful as any movie released in 2007 and is definitely worth owning on blu-ray if you are a Beatles fan or, at the very least, you're familiar enough with their catalogue that the many references to their music are not over your head.  The other big bonus in Across the Universe is its young cast.  The film includes great performances from Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood especially.  I did not know that Wood could sing and evidently she can.<br /><br />The story may sound secondary and it isn't particularly important, primarily because it is not the film's strength.  So I won't dwell on it too much.  It is set in the 1960s as Liverpudlian Jude (Sturgess) heads off to the states to find his father.  When he gets there he befriends Max (Joe Anderson) and his sister Lucy (Wood).  He falls for Lucy amid a backdrop of the Vietnam War and the timely protests.  There are subplots involving other supporting characters with names referencing Beatles songs (i.e. Sadie, Prudence, Jojo) as well. In addition, there are many other interesting details I should leave out.  Suffice to say, Bono as Dr. Robert singing I am the Walrus is great, and Eddie Izzard's entry as Mr. Kite is fun and perhaps appropriately reminiscent of some of Monty Python's work.  The film also includes cameos from Joe Cocker and Salma Hayek.<br /><br />There are things that might dissuade someone's interest in this movie.  Firstly, if you don't like the Beatles, then you probably won't like this.  It is saturated in everything Beatles.  Secondly, if you don't like Taymor's work then you may not appreciate this either.  Taymor tends to put style first and Across the Universe's greatest strengths, even beyond it's amazing [[ASIN:B000WCBPOG soundtrack]], is how the film appears.  Taymor's films are visually immaculate and she wants everything about the story and the characters to melt into the visual elements.  She succeeds here of course and Across the Universe is undeniably a beautiful looking and sounding movie but the viewer is left to decide if they care about that or not.  There are also flashes of her theatrical influences that might strike some viewers as odd but I actually wanted even more of it.  Overall, I enjoyed the film very much and rank it up there as among the best of 2007.gths, even beyond it's amazing [[ASIN:B000WCBPOG soundtrack]], is how the film appears.

B000001EHS|5.0|Best DL collection out there.  I love every song on this & even a few that I've never heard before.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|... how to adequately describe how beautiful and sublime this album is.  My tastes tend to run towards (much) heavier sounds with occasional forays into other (softer) music.  I came to a complete stop with \\"An Ancient Muse\\" and couldn't get up until it was over. From the very first note until it's finish you will find yourself enveloped in a wonderful, musical dream.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Is there anything else to say about this movie that you already don't know?  Practically everyone's top pick for comedys.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|got these as gifts in 2006. very hot guys with hot voices to match. i have all of their cds now.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Didn't know much about this concert before, but was very pleased with just how good it was. More Beatles & George Harrison fans ought to check out this well made concert.
159562015X|3.0|At least I could not. The book may be fine, but I was interested in the test. I could not discover a password that met their requirements and there seems to be no way to contact them unless you already have a login. If you bought this book to take the test, find another way.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I'm a new fan of Jimmy Hendrix, so I wanted to find the one CD collection that contained his most famous hits.  This CD is definitely the one to go with if you want the best bang for your buck.
0743201140|3.0|The site for the 1.0 version is down until the 25'the of February. I also bought the 2.0 book, but was unable to put in a good password, so both books are useless if you want to actually take the test to discover your strengths.
B000VR824S|5.0|One thing that I enjoy most in my life is listening to and watching musical artists, but I also hate concert crowds. Without dwelling on this any further I'll sum up my situation as I don't go to musical concerts because I hate the crowds but I still love the music (my taste in music is varied: it can be classical, bluegrass, blues, folk, rock, flamenco. . . ).  This set of DVDs: \\"Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival\\" is the best of both worlds for me. I can now watch and listen to hours of guitar masters without having to put up with the crowd BS.  If Eric Clapton has a Crossroads Guitar Festival 2008 this summer I'll buy the DVDs from it when they become available.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  It's true.<br /><br />I was born in 1964, am a big Beatles fan and thoroughly enjoy movie musicals.  People either loved or hated Moulin Rouge.  Put me in the LOVE IT camp... so I was hoping Across the Universe would be similar.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Woefully wrong.<br /><br />I couldn't care less about the characters and their cardboard-cutout lives.<br /><br />Some of the musical numbers were unintentionally funny and embarassingly bad, with cheese oozing out from my screen.<br /><br />And the level of pretense made me certain the filmmakers believed they were making a very important piece.<br /><br />They weren't.<br /><br />Across the Universe's only saving graces are great music (it's hard to muck up the Beatles) and stunning visuals... welcome to the MTV generation.<br /><br />I am surprised by how many people rated this film so highly.  I believe there is less discernment between what is quality and what is schlock in this generation.<br /><br />People can like what they want.  It certainly doesn't matter if others were entertained and I wasn't.  I'm just disappointed that I found the movie to be an utter waste of time...
0810945797|5.0|This book is an amazing tome for anyone who grew up in adoration of The Dark Crystal.  Brian Froud's illustrations and concepts are gorgeous and so incredibly creative.  This book is delivered as a history of the World in which the film takes place.  It is narrated by Aughra, \\"...the first and last,\\" who witnessed thousands of years of creation and destruction.  She monitors the cyclical suns, a spectator of the conjunctions that bring the wise urSkeks, and their division a thousand years later into the cruel Skeksis and the mystical urRu.  Aughra alone knows the long history of the crystal and throughout the pages, describes life throughout the ages.  There are so many subtleties that the book describes that I can't wait to watch the film again, knowing the significance of the shapes of rocks, the intricate details of the clothes the characters wear, and the elaborate symbolism peppered throughout.  The art is gorgeous and the insights into the World of the Dark Crystal shed a new light on the film and its philosophy.  Bravo!
B000N4SHOE|4.0|What a delightful movie to watch, very picturesque & idyllic!! I thought both Renee Zellweger & Ewan McGregor were fabulous in this period biopic about children's author Beatrix Potter!    I was impressed to learn all the challenges Ms. Potter faced in order to become a successful author. Ms. Potter was very forward thinking for her time during an era in which women of high society were expected to marry & have children--- not to become independent, career minded and remain unmarried indefinitely.... or at least until one was ready to do so!!    Scenes of the English countryside where Ms. Potter lived in her later years, has me wanting to visit England! This is a must see biopic for Beatrix Potter fans!
0321544080|2.0|I am writing this review from the perspective of someone who is known as the \\"Eternal Optimist\\".  I got the book for the purpose of gaining a serious insight into \\"how he did it\\" - kind of like Scott Kelby's How-to books - which by the way, are all very good.<br /><br />When Joe McNally's photos are seen, one can only wonder, \\"how did he do that?\\", so naturally, we are all inclined to want to get our hands on his book, so we can reproduce his shots, and ultimately learn by doing.<br /><br />Sadly, this book just doesn't come close to providing that end! Half the entire book is simply a full page of his glorious shots. The other half of the book is \\"supposed to be showing you how he did it\\".<br /><br />Each photo is supposed to represent a single element that he wants to stress as the critical component necessary for that particular shot. But seriously, those glorious shots consist of a constellation of critical factors that can NOT be explained on the basis of one \\"hint\\" only.<br /><br />Most of us are buying the book so that we can fully reproduce his shots, but this will never be accomplished by his book alone. Truly, he is providing only a \\"miniscule hint\\" as to the thought processes behind each shot. Some of the hints are useful, but the majority of the book simply represents the interesting story behind the shot, without providing much useful information as to how we can accomplish the same scenario.<br /><br />After reading the book, one has to ask, Does Joe, himself not know how he got the shot? Or is he intentionally just trying to keep us all in the dark, hoping that we'll buy more of his books so that one day we'll come a little closer to a better understanding? Is he afraid that if he tells us too much we may all become his competitors?<br /><br />If you want a pretty \\"picture book\\" then this is it! But if you're desiring  a critical guide to reproducing his shots, you'll finish this book very disappointed, wondering what his motive was for writing the book? Was it simply to make a buck? Or did he really think we were going to get much out of it?<br /><br />While there is something important that can be learned from all photography books, I tend to believe that this book falls into the category of other similar books, which is to say - If you finish most books and come away with 2-3 seriously important points, that change your philosophy and actions, then your money has been well spent.<br /><br />If your goals and intent for reading this book are appropriate, then you won't be disappointed. However, if you think that you'll be reproducing Joe's shots after reading this book, you'll likely come away angry or even  feel betrayed - sad to say.<br /><br />This book underscores the fact that there is no simple solution to creating great, world-class photographs. The more you read, the more you'll know. This book is simply one small step on the road to a lifetime of perpetual self-education.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? I will reservedly say yes, but understand that realistically, you'll come away with more questions than you had before you started, and you'll still be asking yourself the eternal question, \\"I wish I knew just how did he did it\\".<br /><br />Addendum - 3-14-10<br /><br />I would like to emphasize, that I have no negativity towards Joe or his books / DVDs. There is no question that he is an exceptionally talented photographer, but that in this book, he doesn't do a very good job at explaining his workflow.<br /><br />For those of you who are interested in other works that Joe has authored, I would strongly recommend you consider his DVD published by Nikon, \\"Nikon School presents A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting\\".<br /><br />The information presented within this DVD, is extraordinary and prodigus! He clearly is able to present all of the techniques and rationale behind the photographs, and does a very good job with explaining his various thought processes.<br /><br />For all inquiring minds, Joehas done a first rate job with this DVD, and I highly recommend it to all students of photography!
1593083661|3.0|I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy.  Pages 383-430 were missing from my book!  Quite a disappointment.  I would recommend a better quality book from a publisher who won't leave out 47 pages.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Disney and Pixar have done it again with \\"Ratatouille\\".  This was a great movie that I saw with my 10-year old son when it was the the theater and it was at the top of his Christmas list.  It's a fun and funny movie that we have watched several times since Christmas.  A gem in today's movie releases.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This was ordered as a Christmas Present but never arrived.  Apparently the CD was lost in the mail.  When this was discovered Amazon quickly sent another CD via express mail for free.  I was very impressed with how promptly everything was handled.  It was a good experience.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Seasons 1 and 3 down, Season 2 to go. My boyfriend's parents appreciated their Christmas present, and watched some of it that day. Wonderful rainy (or snowy!) day idea.
B000ZK4466|5.0|The album is practically flawless. It is their most intense album, but so fluent and creative. I love almost every song. My favorites are \\"Ouroborous\\", \\"Wax Simulacra\\", \\"Mtetatron\\", and \\"Goliath\\". It is definitely worth picking up.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|this is the first film where chris evans doesn't act like a cocky a-hole trying to be funny. and he's great! the first time i liked him in anything. he played his character really well.<br /><br />the best things about this movie: loved the atmosphere of the setting. i don't remember a sci-fi ship design being this good since the first alien or the abyss station. loved the spacesuit designs, not sexy at all, and they're not supposed to be. loved the diverse cast.<br /><br />sure there are flaws. i think the story could have been just as exciting without the fanatical religious character, that's already been done in contact. i wished they would have had to face only technical problems like in apollo 13. still, i don't remember the last time i was so wowed by a sci-fi film. loved the soundtrack too.<br /><br />fyi, this is coming from someone who hated armageddon.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|If no one noticed, Spielberg's movie is NOT the first filmed version of the Jonas book (and before that headlines in a series of articles by Jack Anderson).  That honor belongs to director Michael Anderson's (AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, LOGAN'S RUN) THE SWORD OF GIDEON.  It ran on HBO about 20 years earlier.  The cast included Steven Bauer, Michael York, Collen Dewhearst (as Golda Meair) and Rod Steiger in the role of the Mossad chief.  Search this one out and you won't be disappointed.
0060245867|5.0|BOTTOM LINE:    Numeroff does it again!  Anyone who gives this less than 4 stars is a soulless android. There is NOTHING to not like about this book in a series of 'If you give a ...'! It is laugh out loud funny, great to read, and the pictures are cute and hilarious! The story has a nice touch of irony without forcing a MESSAGE.    I think its wonderful to have a children's book that is so clever and whimsical - hard to find one nowadays. Not only does my 6-yr old love it, but I love it myself. :-)
0525950079|5.0|I read Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" in the early 90s but when I heard he had written \\"World Without End\\", I re-read \\"Pillars\\".  I read \\"World\\" in less than a week and truly did not want it to end.  I have even gone to Ken Follett's website and written him an email thanking him for this fabulous journey with Caris and the other characters.  I feel like I know them all so well. The way the author develops these very human characters is so thorough - you learn to understand how they think and you can almost feel their intensity. My hatred for the villain (readers know who I mean) is still very strong - three days after finishing the book! Reading about England during that time has encouraged me to research the history of that era.  I have been to Salisbury Cathedral in England (one of the cathedrals Follett used as his model)and that helped me visualize the church. There are several websites online with pictures of those beautiful masterpieces.<br /><br />I highly recommend both books (and all Follett's books as well).  He's been a favorite of mine for most of my adult life.  I've also seen him on television interviews and he is a very down-to-earth guy.
0743496736|5.0|Perhaps one of the most thought-provoking novels that I have ever read, 19 minutes, at times, was so heavy that I had to put it down. Although I think it could have been shorter (maybe 75 to 100 pages) it was probably necessary to keep the integrity of the story. It also left me reeling and considering things that I thought that I never would..one being, what would I do if faced with the same things that Peter Hooten did? How would I feel? Were his actions justified? If I were the mother of a \\"school\\" shooter, how would I go on? How would I pick up the pieces of my life if I were a victim, and survived this mass shooting? I found myself, feeling sorry for the villian, and silently wishing that he would be vindicated in the end, although I know that what he did was wrong. First of all, I think we have all felt uncomfortable with our own skins, and desperately wish that we could all fit in and be the one that people look up to.     Peter Hooten decides that he is going to pay back those who have tormented and bullied him since kindergarten (\\"they started it\\") by going on a shooting spree in his high school. Stopping just short of killing the one person who use to be his best friend, Josie, we see Peter change from a sweet kid with glasses, into a computer expert (who creates a game where he kills those who have hurt him). Josie, the daughter of an ambitious Judge, has stopped hanging with Peter, for fear that she will be an outcast, and become part of the crowd that she use to fight against being a member, the popular kids. Plagued with feelings of inadequecy and issues about being \\"fatherless\\" and unloved, Josie sets out on a dangerous path that will lead to her eventual heartache. Josie's claim to fame is dating the ultra-popular jock Matt, whose sole purpose is making Peter's life a living hell. Matt's comrade in arms (with torturing Peter) is Drew, who survives the shooting, and isn't ready to admit that maybe he is responsible for what has happened.     Fed up with Drew,Matt, other tormentors and his life in general, Peter decides to take matters into his own hands by shooting and killing 10 students and wounding several dozen others within a spand of 10 minutes (a la the title).     What makes this novel so unique was the different the different perspectives of the person telling the story. You have Peter's version (who did not commit suicide following the shooting) of why he committed the acts. We live thru his trial, his feelings of inadequecy, his fears, his regrets, his guilt and his struggle to come to peace with himself. We have the perspective of Jordan, the defense attorney, who now views his client through new eyes because he is a new father. Lacey, Peter's mom, and a midwife, is full of regrets and guilt over her son's crime and her deceased son's secrets. Lewis, Peter's father and a economist known for solving the meaning of happiness, is struggling to understand where he went wrong....one golden child killed by a drunk driver, whicle the other is imprisoned for the rest of his life for one of the most horrific crimes in his community. Then there is Alex, Josie's mom, who wants nothing more than to obtain his success, as a judge and overcome her guilt for being a single mother and \\"failing\\" her daughter by not \\"being there for her\\". These are but a few of the characters that make this novel powerful. This novel attempts to discuss some very real issues that impact the youth of today: mental illness, sex, drugs, teen pregnancy, depression and violence.     There is so much to love about this novel, that I won't tell you everything but suggest that you read it and enjoy the twists and turns.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|I don't know why, but for whatever reason Zodiac is released by Warner rather than Paramount in the UK.  At the time of writing Paramount remain HD DVD exclusive, but you can pre-order (available end of April) the blu-ray version of this great film form amazon.co.uk and other UK sites.  To the best of my knowledge all Warner releases are region free and should therefore play on US BD players and PS3s.
1401300529|5.0|This is Halberstam's magnum opus and is a wonderful restatement of his essential criticisms of American foreign policy.  Other reviewers' criticism of the book as adding nothing \\"new\\" is not fair.  First, this ignores the fruits of Halberstam's decades of interviews with company commanders, soldiers, policymakers, and with greats like Ridgway.  Second, the reviewers miss the essential point that Halberstam is giving us a new and important interpretation of history that puts the Korean War in its proper context as one of the seminal events of the postwar era.    Korea was the first limited conflict in a century of total war, and for that reason alone deserves special study.  An important strand of political thought, which MacArthur attempted to exploit, could not come to terms with this.  And in Vietnam as well as in subsequent conflicts, we see that frustration boil to the surface and be exploited by various politicians.      Halberstam's essential thesis is that American foreign policy is to a significant extent determined by domestic sources -- sources that are themselves dysfunctional and that tend to skew foreign policy in an often tragic fashion.  In particular, the deep racism of American culture prevented generals and important policymakers from appreciating the skills of the Chinese and North Koreans, and from exploiting the important rifts between China and North Korea as well as between the Soviet Union and China.  Too often we viewed these cultures monolithically and in a condescending fashion.    Another problem is what Hofstadter terms the \\"paranoid style\\" in American politics.  Halberstam's narrative is excellent in bringing this to life.  The \\"China Lobby\\" ignored the facts to build up the myth of Chaing and the \\"loss\\" of China.  It didn't really matter what the facts were.  What mattered was constructing a compelling narrative of an opportunity \\"lost\\" by the striped-pants sissies and traitors in the State Department.  In this narrative, even Marshall's patriotism is suspect, a completely irrational and mean-spirited assertion.  But it does fall within the grand tradition of the paranoid style that attacked Adams and Lincoln; that led to the \\"Know-Nothing\\" movement of the 1840s; that fanned the flames of the Palmer raids in 1919; and that resulted in the Japanese internment.      Our dysfunctional and often vicious domestic politics made Truman's position impossible -- but it also led Kennedy to walk the tightrope in Vietnam, sank Johnson, and tempted Bush to think he could define his own reality in Iraq.  Mix in messianic notions of American exceptionalism and a view of the world tinged by racism and we can see the roots of all the disastrous miscalculations of the last half-century -- dropping the Bomb, failing to internationalize atomic energy, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq.      On the other hand, American in the end did the right thing in Korea and in the Cold War in general.  Its misadventures have been tragic, but America has been, on balance, a force for peace and democracy and has used its superpower status in a manner far more responsible than its predecessors. And at the individual level, one can only read with great national pride about the conduct of the likes of generals like Ridgway and Walker, and junior officers like McGee.  These men reflect everything that is good and decent in the American character.     Halberstam's zeal at uncovering the truth leads him to paint greats like Truman, Acheson, and even Marshall in an ambivalent light.  Truman did the right thing in canning MacArthur, but he is responsible for a great deal of miscalculation before then.  And Acheson, while a subtle thinker and often right in his judgments, comes off as unconscionably weak in going along with the vague instructions to MacArthur that gave the General room to create the disaster.  Most tragic is the brief appearance of the Vietnam-era Acheson as angry cold-warrior and as a Cheney-like caricature of himself.  Even Marshall has uncharacteristic moments of weakness in responding to the disaster that befell the U.N. forces after the Chinese invasion.     Halberstam gives MacArthur what he deserves -- in a way that only someone with the uncompromising passion of Halberstam can.  I suppose the MacArthur of the first 30 years of the century was a great man.  But the vain and corrupt General of the 1940s and 1950s -- on the take from Philippines politicians, the man who screwed up the defense of the Philippines, the guy who took credit for what Nimitz did, the man who would dare to be the general-in-chief in Korea without ever spending so much as one overnight there -- that man was deserving of reproach.  But the guy who could not admit his own mistake in pushing toward the Yalu, who refused to take the steps necessary to rally his own defeated troops, and who would advocate a larger war against China to cover his own miscalculations -- that man belongs in the Hall of Shame with the likes of George Armstrong Custer, George McClellan, and Benedict Arnold.      This is a remarkable book.  I wish we could have heard more about how Ridgway handled things and about the last 2 years of the War.  But it is powerfully written and is an important addition to the field.  Best of all, it's completely absorbing.  I highly recommend it.
B00000K31Q|5.0|\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\", an adaptation of Shakespeare's [[ASIN:074347757X The Taming of the Shrew (New Folger Library Shakespeare)]], is one of my favorite movies. Not only is the music great (so good it gets the 5 starts just for that, the [[ASIN:B00000IGPN 10 Things I Hate About You: Music From The Motion Picture]] is excellent) but the acting is also excellent. The movie has memorable, funny and interesting characters. The situation in which they find themselves are hilarious. I love when the father, a gynecologists, makes his daughters put on a fake pregnant belly to teach them the consequences of sex, or when Julia Style's character gets drunk and starts dancing. The movie is one of the top movies of the Teen Flicks Romantic Comedies.

0307383415|5.0|A most revealing work which reads like a novel.  He must have kept a journal for there are so  many conversations given verbatim which makes it a real experience in reading.  However, there are so many characters in this \\"novel\\" that one has a tough time keeping tract.  But that really is not necessary anyway. This is all the more informative in view of the unique excitement he has stirred among the American people.  He is critized for lack of experience but this extrodinary book belies that lack.  These are the exeriences of one who could indeed be a most significant President - maybe close to the significance of that other man from Illionis.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Replying to post > C. Everall \\"EL\\".    First of all, there is nothing naked in this Beowulf Director's Cut.    It's has a few seconds scene added back with more violent, gore and blood not found in normal version.     What included is;    A guy licking a woman breast in mead hall,   A guy drag and pleasing a woman behind a table,   And lastly where Grendel rip off a guy into two parts and drink his blood before throwing it away.    Well, that's all. If you ask how I know? I can tell you because I have already seen this Beowulf Director's Cut before it is release. Hehe~~~
0385522401|2.0|This was my fourth McEwan book and given my familiarity with his writing I found the plot predictable and the writing boring. This short story is about a young couple's honeymoon night in 1962. McEwan, as usual, does an outstanding job leading to a conflict. All the 4 books that I read involved a minor decision/judgement which significantly altered the course of events in the characters' lives. McEwan is very good at leading to these conflicts and creating suspense. So why did I give it only 2 stars? About half the book is very boring. It is written dryly about the past lives of the two main characters. Furthermore there were themes that I found that McEwan repeated in this book. For example, he writes about points scored in a tennis match (in Saturday he wrote in detail about a squash game). He also likes wrote about political disputes and music (also in Saturday and Amsterdam respectively).     Interestingly, I was disappointed that the author referred to a character being \\"nauseous\\" when he meant \\"nauseated\\". For such a fine author, I was surprised he made that error and that his editor did not correct him. If you are not familiar with McEwan then you will be moved by this book and perhaps bored a little. On the other hand, if you have read other McEwan books, you may find the plot outcome predictable and  the writing tedious.
0525950079|4.0|I realize that this book takes place 200 years after Pillars of the Earth, but I found it a little modern in its approach, nonetheless.  After all, it is still 700 years ago.  I found Caris to be a bit much to swallow in the context of actual life during that period.  As usual, Ken Follett is a master story-teller, and the research for this book is mind-boggling. (It was impossible to find a stopping place, though with a book this long it is necessary.)  A great read, fantastic scope, amazing images, lots of history, and overall a worthwhile book; but I couldn't help feeling that Pillars of the Earth was a more believable gem of a book without the politically correct social commentary that Follett felt necessary in this  one.14
B000XA5K48|1.0|I love action movies, and I love Clive Owen.  I thought I'd love this movie.  But I have never seen such a misogynistic piece of crap.  Women are clearly considered only good for one thing (and they don't even have to be alive to be good for it).  I was thoroughly disgusted.  And by the way, the action is so cartoonish, you'd be better off watching the Coyote try to drop anvils on the Roadrunner's head.  I don't recommend this movie for anyone with a functioning brain.

B000GPI2EK|2.0|Everyone keeps saying this is \\"Thinking Man's Metal\\".  If a thinking man can't understand the vocals, there is not much to think about now is there?  There has already been a band that has forged this ground long ago, \\"Thinking Man's Metal\\", and that was IRON MAIDEN.  These guys cannot touch MAIDEN in their heyday.  The music is good and they have talent, no doubt, but man, what happened to singing a song instead of gagging it. 2 stars for the guitars.  Also, the drum fill-ins are cool the first 150 times, after that, it wears a little thin.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Hollywood seems to have gone belly-up when it comes to \\"horror movies\\",  as evidenced by this mish-mash of a teenage summer flick.  On the bright side,  the cinematography,  lighting,  and special effects are very good. The blood and guts scenes are inventive and ample,  for us gore-hounds out there.  And that's all, folks!  The writing sucks,  as does the acting.  The story is absurd and who gives a damn about the so-called characters.  Not ONE good scare in the entire movie,  and it's overlong to boot.  Why do all of these dumb phony horror extravaganzas degenerate into a battle between God and the Devil?  Poe,  Lovecraft, Henry James,  and even the early stuff by Steven King did not fall into this obvious genre trap.  I'm afraid that Dracula was the last of the great horror concepts.  If you want to see REAL horror movies,  try Rosemary's Baby,  The Innocents,  Black Sabbath (or anything else by Mario Bava),  Don't Look Now, Psycho,  or any of the old monster movies (not 50's atomic sci-fi--although that stuff is highly entertaining,  and sometimes classic).   Glad I did not buy this nonsense.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Animatrix is a dream for people who love science fiction, cyber punk and post-cyber punk.  Wonderful stories, great art work, good character design and loads of extras on the DVD.  9 short films exploring the incredible possibilities within the Matrix setting.  Being a fan of Ghost in the Shell and hard science fiction this was a real treat.  I also happen to enjoy the idea of robots and artificial intelligence and found the Second Renaissance Parts I & II to be breath taking.  A Detective Story was very much a sci-fi noir story which reminded me of 1984 and Brazil all at the same time.<br />Very much for mature viewers only, 17 and up.  Too bad the post-Matrix movies set in the world of the Matrix were so bad.
0452286751|1.0|For the sake of clarity, I will separate this review into two parts that are often, in other reviews, confused, and need be distinguished to accurately review a work of \\"philosophical literature.\\" The first part will review THE FOUNTAINHEAD as literature; the second, as philosophy.    THE FOUNTAINHEAD as Literature:   As literature, I cannot see much, if any, value to this novel. The plot is decent, though nothing to rave about as others do; for an explication of it I point you to the plot summary above. My biggest complaint with Rand's literature is her characters.   Here, as elsewhere in her corpus of writings, characters serve merely as mouthpieces for philosophical ideals. Out with psychological realism, out with any sort of compelling, human elements--here we see \\"ideal men\\" who be either pinnacles of perfection, or paradigms of evil. Some proclaim the originality of this, but I can point out myriad cases in which other authors have attempted to create archetypes of various ideals; none of them are very compelling, despite being far better framed and in the hands of far more skilled writers than Rand.   Take, for example, Alyosha from Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky is a phenomenal writer, yet even he could not save his \\"hero\\" from failure as a compelling character; Mitya and, especially, Ivan, steal the book and redeem it. Some will debate me, and say Rand's characters ARE in fact compelling; I ask them to read a play of Shakespeare, or look at Satan in Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\", or Prince Andrei and Pierre in Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace,\\" (the peaks of great characters), and still try to tell me Rand's characters are interesting. They are flat, two-dimensional, and boring; they are not human. Her language, too, is flat; her ideas are nothing original; and by no measure of literary greatness does THE FOUNTAINHEAD stand strong.    THE FOUNTAINHEAD as Philosophy:   I must admit that seeing Rand's \\"Objectivism\\" accepted in many philosophy departments (including my own university's) as genuine pains me greatly. I will not attack her philosophy point-by-point; that belongs more appropriately in a review of her main philosophical work, \\"The Virtue of Selfishness.\\" Instead, I dispute the originality and \\"freshness\\" of her philosophy, two qualities many claim on Rand's behalf. A deeper study of her ideas shows one that the philosophy expressed in THE FOUNTAINHEAD and in her other works, is little more than a gleaning of ideas from Stoicism, Nietzsche, and, ironically, Kant (she railed against Kant, probably in an attempt to disguise his influence upon her; much in the same way T.S. Eliot decried Whitman to hide his debt). Randianism is an amalgam of these other philosophers' ideas, and nothing new or fresh. Her presentation isn't even fresh; the philosophical novel is not a new idea, and has been done better elsewhere: look to Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" Dr. Johnson's \\"Rasselas,\\" Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace.\\"           If you like Randianism, fine. I can do little to change that. My only wish is that Randians would admit her debt to truly great philosophers like the Stoics, and, most especially, Immanuel Kant. I expect that the Randians, who often act in a sheepish cult-like manner (ironic for a group that preaches \\"individualism\\"), will rate this review, as they rate every negative review of Rand, quite lowly. So be it...
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I have the other star Trek DVD releases and was happy with them. (First the individual 40 DVD set and then the season sets.) Given that I almost didn't buy this set. Once Amazon lowered the pre-order price, I couldn't resist. I am glad I have them! The CGI effects are stunning. Sure it replaces the originals, but for me, it makes the TV series look more like the movies. I don't have a HD DVD player so I can't comment on them, but the standard DVD side of the series looks awesome. They look better than they did when they were first aired back in the late 60's! If you want to see Star Trek better than it has ever looked, this is the set for you! I would have given it 4 stars but I cut back on one due to the price. Although it is an impressive set, the price was still too much.
B00008PX8P|5.0|How often does twenty bucks take you back to some of the greatest times of your life; when you were carefree driving around with your friends, the stereo cranked to the maximum? This DVD gives me goosebumps and can put a smile on my face for days!     It doesn't matter if you were old enough to see them live in the early days, are like me and missed seeing them in '77 and '80 because of Karac Plant and Bonham's death, or weren't yet alive for the subsequent breakup - this is a MUST HAVE DVD for anyone who appreciates this band or the history of rock and roll. It starts out with the Royal Albert Hall show in '70 and really showcases the young, playful side of the band. Plant looks SO young, Page dancing around in those white tennis shoes is a joy and what more can be said about the bare-handed beating that Bonham gives those drums? Unfortunately, video of JPJ is fairly scarce. This gives way to footage from the Madison Sq Garden shows that also produced the film The Song Remains the Same. How many times did we see that show at the Midnight Movie during high school? Good times.... By the time they roll through some of the vaunted Earl's Court set in '75 and get to Knebworth, you can really see how the journey has changed the band. Plant looks worldy-wise beyond his years after his near-fatal car wreck and the death of his son, Page and Bonham are battling their addictions, and JPJ is as solid as ever - and yet they are still at the top of their game, playing in front of thousands of adoring fans. In addition, you get some really cool footage of early televised segments in which the almost unknown band shocks the socks off unsuspecting Europeans!     The video and sound quality is excellent, too. I have access to a life- size video screen and dts 5.1 set-up and I swear it's almost like being there. If you want to experience rock at its finest - you must get this DVD

075640407X|5.0|I finally broke down and got this book around Christmas.  I'd heard great reviews from multiple sources, but I figured I'd wait until the paperback.  In this case, I'm glad I was impatient.  This book is outstanding and I'm definately looking forward to the rest of the series.  I just saw that the paperback is being released this spring; but after how much I enjoyed this book, I'll be picking it up the sequel in hardback as soon as it's released as well.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The music on this box set is a must for all Lord of the Rings fans, Soundtracks are the new classic music and this soundtrack is truly classic. Glad to here the Rohan theme alongside the themes for Gondor. Now I can picture the film whilst working.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Little Voice by Sara Bareilles is one of the best albums of 2007 in my opionion. Bareilles's voice is anything but little, her voice is powerful and rich. She is even a better songwriter, no silly pop fluff here, deep and meaningful lyrics. This album is produced by Eric Rosse (he used to date Tori Amos) he really gets to the heart and importance of this album. I cannot tell you how much I love Bareilles's vocals, she gives me chills. Every track is unique and different, the first single Love Song is catchy and addictive. The best song on the album is Gravity, the way she holds that second to the last note is stunning. My fave track is Come Round Soon, I can't get this song out of my head!  Her voice reminds me a little of PJ Harvey especially on the track, Between the Lines and Fiona Apple on Many the Miles. Hopefully this album will make Sara a huge star, she deserves it! Great singer, pianist, and lyricst. I highly recommend this rock/pop gem!
0385339100|5.0|Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers read a different book from the one I did.  \\"The Partner\\" is a case in point.  In my view this is one of Grisham's best, and I've not always been pleased with his novels, e.g., \\"The King of Torts.\\"<br /><br />The plot of \\"Partner\\" had enough satisfying twists to hold my interest, to keep me reading very late into the night.  A seemingly impossible situation has been created for the protagonist, his female counterpart and the lawyer/friend who represents the central character.  Ninety million dollars has been stolen and the thief has decamped to Brazil, only to be caught years later and brought back to America.  There is a dead body in a burned out vehicle, so the thief is charged not only with theft but murder.  The trap for him has no apparent escape hatch.  Ah, but that is the crux of the story.<br /><br />The characters are many and varied.  Grisham, a lawyer, apparently has little regard for his profession.  Most of the attorneys here would sell their grandmother down the river for a little gold and glory.  Still, there is considerable empathy for the central characters.<br /><br />The atmosphere includes Brazil, Mississippi's coast cities, with a few sojourns to France, England, etc.  While not intrusive, the atmosphere is always appropriate as background to the plot.<br /><br />Add up the plot, the characters, and the atmosphere, all fine, and this is a first rate pot-boiler.  Some reviewers apparently were displeased with the ending.  I thought it was extremely good--appropriate and satisfying.  It leads me to wonder what was expected by those who didn't like the finale.

B000XCZGV8|5.0|David Fincher's film, Zodiac, is largely based on Robert Graysmith's disputed writings on the Zodiac Killer. Although Fincher seems to want to keep a balanced and accurate point-of-view (perhaps best illustrated by the fact that a different actor plays the main suspect than who plays the actual killer), the film is mainly tailored to people who believe Graysmith. That much can be said of the theatrical release. Does the Director's Cut Release address this problem? The answer is an emphatic YES!<br /><br />What makes this version stand out from the theatrical cut is NOT the extra scenes (6 extra minutes? Come on!).<br /><br />What makes it truly worth owning is the generous amount of bonus features.<br />These features include two very lengthy documentaries: 1 on the case itself, and 1 on suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Both documentaries (especially the 2nd one) really balance things out. It is in these documentaries that you are able to get alternative viewpoints to Graysmith's claims. If you felt that the actual movie was more biased than factual, these little gems should cure what ails ya! Heck, if you simply felt the movie dwelt too much on the cops & reporters and not enough on the actual murders, then this should cure what ails ya!<br /><br />So, whether you believe Graysmith or whether you think he's a sensationalist, there'll be something for you in this exceptional DVD release. As I said in the title of my review, this has \\"something for everybody\\".
B000WS4QJG|4.0|This second re-issue of [[ASIN:B0000025RI Thriller]] is a better re-issue than the [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ 2001 Special Edition]]. The sound quality is a lot better.

1595141715|5.0|1. The premise: Clay Jenson comes home to find 13 audiocassettes bearing the voice of his crush Hannah Baker, who's just committed suicide.  2. The tapes have the 13 reasons why she did what she did. Don't YOU want to know why?  3. \\"I hope you're ready, because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended.\\" You can't say no to that.  4. It's a page-turner. Like Clay, you won't be able to put it down till you've heard every last one of her words.  5. Hannah lists the 13 people who have contributed to her decision to end her life, and all 13 of them have to listen, or else. How do you know you're not one of them?  6. I wasn't actually joking there. Most readers will be able to see themselves and people they know in these characters. A lot of them didn't even do anything that's so terrible.  7. Seeing yourself and/or people you know will make you reevaluate your entire life and think about the little things that somehow had a really big impact on you, and how things you've done might have affected others more than you realize.  8. Okay, since I have 13, I'm going to say just one negative thing, which is that the storyline about the drunk driver didn't seem to have any connection to the rest of the book. But that's the only negative. Really.  9. It's a rare book that shows the power of rumors and words so well.  10. Actually, you shouldn't just read this book; you should buy it too, because you're going to want to read it again.  11. Do you have anything better to do?  12. Because I told you to.  13. You won't regret it.

B000J234SY|5.0|I bought this version, the Japanese remaster, to see if there was an improvement in sound over my original 80's A&M release. This version sounds a lot better, the most improvement being in the areas of stereo separation and the bass sound. Sting was never known for having a cutting bass sound; it is cleaned up here to his advantage. The cymbals on the drums are better here, as well. However, the original CD release didn't sound bad to my ears. One has to consider the source - this was made at Surrey Sound Studios, which was not a state-of-the-art facility, so this is no Pink Floyd - esque recording in sound quality to begin with. If you are picky about sound, and love The Police, this is well worth the money.
B000XTCBWS|5.0|Joseph Keilberth was one of the most underrated conductors of Wagner.  While he contributed little to the recording studio, he did much in Europe as a conductor to bring transparency, clarity, beauty, and propulsion to Wagner's music dramas with his own brand of Germanic philosophy.  With Keilberth, you get a complete package from beginning to end--you get a bit of Solti's bombast and histrionics, Bohm's drive, and Knappertsbusch's gravity.  At the same time, you get a superb story teller who never fails to point out the underlying drama that makes Wagner's Ring such a challenging work to conduct.  In fact, among all the Ring Masters outside Daniel Barenboim and Clemens Krauss, he perhaps gets more out of his orchestra by his amalgamation of insight (and he really does still retain a personal stamp).  Keilberth really should have been known better as a Wagner conductor.  In fact, he died conducting Tristan und Isolde--a tragic death somewhat befitting any great musician on the podium, if that kind of end was one's cup of tea.  Walkure is conducted with urgency, lyricism, and transparency.  Keilberth, too, captures the high drama that Bohm provides in spades in his seminal recording more than ten years later.  The Siegfried here is probably the best live version on disc.  Keilberth's orchestra creates the perfect foil to the drama while precisely capturing the atmosphere and the moment of the score.  For once, Siegfried is not the boring day of the Ring.  The forging song, for example, is followed word for word by the Bayreuth players with the precision of a Swiss watch.  Rheingold is another gem, but the sound is somehow not captured as optimally as in the other operas.  One can complain by the poor orchestral sound that Barenboim would hone to perfection decades later, but for the most part the Bayreuth band is up to the task of making the Ring live through sound.<br /><br />The cast is perhaps the jewel in this recording.  While Astrid Varnay's Brunnhilde is a known commodity, it has never been captured in better form, sound, and beauty than in this recording.  The full harmonic range of her voice is effectively heard in this recording without the distortion that would later affect Nilsson's vocal interpretation in the Solti Ring.  Those Decca engineers really did a splendid job. Her Walkure Brunnhilde has everything that the character needs and more.  She truly was an artist that should be experienced onstage, but this recording more than suffices for those who came too late to hear her.  Her Siegfried Brunnhilde is sung with all the notes and dynamic markings on check, and it is wonderful to hear her secure voice sailing through music of such a high tessitura.  The Gotterdammerung Brunnhilde though, is perhaps what delineates her from all other Brunnhildes.  Her first act duet with Siegfried and the confrontation between the Gunther-clad hero is frighteningly real.  Her second act is a powerhouse of rage, and only she would perhaps have the freshness to get through the last act immolation scene while at the same time imbuing the music with the nervous energy that made her Brunnhilde so famous.<br /><br />Hans Hotter's Wotan is probably the other reason to buy this recording.  His magisterial voice, so perfect for the part, is captured here in stereo sound while imparting a youthful vigor and firmness absent in his studio recording with Solti.  His Rheingold Wotan is also heard for the first time in good sound.  The sensitivity of this artist has never been more exposed.  While Solti's recordings caught him at the end of his career, even when he had much to offer, the Keilberth Ring gives us a freshness that never quite takes off by the mid-1960s.  His \\"Dir Unweisen Ruf dich ins Ohr\\" is the masterpiece of a Lieder singer, and his farewell to Brunnhilde has never been more painfully beautiful.<br /><br />Wolfgang Windgassen's Siegfried is captured in its prime.  When it was heard in both the Bohm and Solti Rings years later,it had already lost some flexibility and had begun to sound leathery.  In this recording, Windgassen sounds as fresh as Siegfried should.  His energy is an asset to the first Siegfried in the opera of his character's namesake.  Listen to the forging scene and the awakening act if you want to know what I mean.  And yet, this man is one of the most outstanding artists ever to sing Wagner.  His Gotterdammerung Siegfried is the best exponent of this.  Has Siegfried ever died more beautifully?<br /><br />The Walsung twins in this recording are assumed by Ramon Vinay and Gre Brouwenstijn.  A far cry from King and Rysanek more than a decade later, but this is still first class singing if the two singers were around today.  I just find Vinay's voice a bit too baritonal, but that's just me.  Maria von Ilosvay is a fantastic Erda and Waltraute.  Her voice has the necessary leaden weight to give her characters the wisdom and the mystery that is so often missed by many a modern singer.  Georgine von Milinkovic may not have the vocal glamour or artistry of Christa Ludwig, but she more than makes up for it with good singing and characterization.  Hagen is played by the malevolent Josef Greindl, Bayreuth's bass of choice for almost two decades.  The giants are well cast too, and the Norns, Rhinemaidens, and Valkyries are an endearing piece of casting from Wieland Wagner's legendary Bayreuth team.<br /><br />And of this set?  Since Testament has decided to release it in a slightly cheaper box set, I recommend that you buy it now and savor what a Bayreuth Ring in excellent sound from a bygone age of singing was truly like.  I assure you that you won't be disappointed.
B000SQKZKG|5.0|There are some who liked this Shout Factory remaster better then the Rhino Records version, but I didn't hear any significant improvement. I have the original Rhino / Wea CD release and this one, and they both sound about the same to me, doing a careful A/B with audiophile headphones, a headphone amp, and audiophile CD player. It's a great live album though, and has what I think is the best-ever recorded rock drum solo, thanks to Carl Palmer. The live version of \\"Aquatarkus\\" is worth the price of the album alone, as is \\"Tocatta.\\" But sonically, this wasn't any miraculous re-mastering job....what we need is a re-mixing of this album. I do think this version offers sound improvement over the Victory release of the early 90's, which I also have.

0810993139|2.0|This book has a GREAT cover (love the art and entire concept).  It has a great title, too. And the concept--with graphic cartoon art scattered through the text of a diary is wonderful.  The pacing of the story makes it an easy and quick read. I understand why it's attractive.    What prompts me to give it a low rating, though, is the main character.  I disliked him intensely.  Another reviewer talks about how whiny he is--and that's true.  What bothers me even more, though, is his penchant for bullying --he's not the victim so much as the perpetrator.      He mistreats his \\"best\\" friend, Rowley--cruelly--in the sledding incident, in the entire relationship on playing video games and such, in letting Rowley take the rap for the MC's own mistreatment of kindergarten kids.  And the best friend Rowley seems slow or just particularly immature for a 7th grader, making him more vulnerable and the MC even less nice.    The MC loves to scare little kids, like those kindergartners he's escorting home, like the kids he lures to his scam \\"haunted house,\\" and like his little brother.  He thinks a cool joke is a tack on his teacher's chair. His idea of a good reason to participate in the school play is to throw apples at a girl he dislikes because she prevented him from cheating on a test.    This is not humor, but a sadistic wish to be the bully.    There are a few truly funny moments in the book, but all of the positives do not outweigh the basic and horrible negatives of a MC who is unlikeable and worse.
0805079831|5.0|A lot of history in this book--Dense and makes for slow-going reading.  Thoroughly depressing, but compelling and utterly brilliant.  I liked her previous books, but this is on a completely different level.  Pair it up with Kinzer's Overthrow and you will have a good behind-the-official-rhetoric (read: \\"spreading democracy\\") overview of the United States' foreign policy in the twentieth century.  The weakest part is the title and trying to give a punchy name to phenomenon she's describing.  It rubs me the wrong way, but this is only a minor quibble.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|You want to enjoy Beatle songs? Listen to your Beatles collection. These flower children are still trying to tell us that they were right and we were wrong. I'd much rather fight for my country abroad, than fight against it at home. The mindset of the director of across the universe is pityful. To portray US soldiers, dressed like Fidel Castro! Well, you must be an embecile! Don't waste your money like I did in buying this movie. It stinks. Vietnam Vet, 1st MarDiv, 1st Shore Party Bat. 1967,68
0385520298|4.0|Told with the broken English of Z, a young woman from a small town in China coming to learn English in London for a year. There she meets an older man, a \\"drifter\\", and we follow their imperfect story as Z discovers herself and how to communicate through her lover. I read this book in a couple of days, it is a quick read that touches without pretense on issues such as loneliness, happiness, couplehood, friendship, sex, independence/dependence. Z will break down your prejudices and make you see people in a new light. Recommended.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|80% of the tracks here are excellent.  It is immediately apparent that this is not the same QOTSA from the previous 3 albums (especially when you look at the live material from the subsequent tour on Over The Years And Through The Woods).  A darker sound with some amount of blues influence.  \\"Tangled up in Plaid,\\" \\"Someone's in the Wolf,\\" and \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" are definite standouts.  Highly recommended.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Tobias Sammet is the Verdi of our age.  He has the broadest brush of any composer today.  I don't say composer lightly.  He is more than a song writer.  His arrangements, chord progressions, and lyricism are unmatched by anyone.  The musical complexity and variety leave you spell bound, open mouthed and filled with awe.  This crazy guy has two bands:  EdGuy and Avantasia and there are rumors of a third.  Music pours out of him.  At his live performance with EdGuy at BB Kings in New York last fall, you could hardly watch him.  He was more electrified than the lead guitar, dancing on the speakers, racing from one side of the stage to the other, screaming out one hit after another.  Did I say he does all the vocals in a male range rivaling Celine or Mariah.  He could probably match note for note all the whining guitar rifts he writes.    So how does this album stack up.  His best to date.  There isn't a bad cut on the entire album.  The other reviewers have mentioned all the best songs, but I encourage a listen to all of them in the order he listed them and pay special attention to \\"The Toy Master\\" where Alice Cooper (yes that Alice Cooper) sings the lead vocals. This song should be released by Alice as a come back single.  It so rocks and it is so Alice on steroids.      Sammet is a god in Europe and if the USA music world werent so fixated on rap crap instead of Rock, we would all be the better for it.  But hey it doesnt matter so much anymore with the music labels so out of touch with their audience.  You can get this great rock music anyway.  Please pay for it and support Avantasia and Sammet.
B001041JKU|5.0|Michael Jackson's Thriller is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Thriller sucessfully combined every genre of music into one album and easily puts to shame half of the music today. Not many artists can put out an album where every song has single potential and songs such as Wanna Be Start Sumthin, P.Y.T., Billie Jean and the rest of the songs on rhe album still stand the test of time. As for the 2008 versions of the songs they are sub par at best and I would have liked to hear a cover album. First and foremost Mr. Kanye West brings nothing new to Billie Jean, either Kanye had an off day or he was paid a pretty penny to do the track because it sounds horrible ! Next comes the talented Fergie who insults Beat It with her tepid vocals;I'm a Fergie fan but like Kanye West she's wasted. There is some hope in the CD with Will I Am and Akon. Will I Am  does justice to P.Y.T. and The Girl Is Mine turning both into ear candy for the listener. Much to my surpise Akon does Wanna Be Startin Sumthin justice doing a great vocal tag team with Jackson. The CD also features the unreleased ballad For All Time which is fine in it's own right. Thankfully no one touched Thriller however I think the bonus disc could have benefitted  with a few improvements. The prince of R&B Mr. Chris Brown would have done justice to Baby Be Mine (one of my personal favorites) and Justin Timberlake would have sounded better on Beat It. A strong songer like Mario,Eric Roberson or Anthony Hamiltion could have did justice to The Lady In My Life while Ne-Yo or The Dream would have killed Human Nature.  In closing Thriller is a great album that didn't need a re-release maybe a cover album similar to Interpretations: Celebrating the Music of Earth Wind & Fire but Michael is still the KING and Thiller is still one of the greatest albums of all time.
1455523003|1.0|There is no doubt that the world needs contrarians who are willing to challenge rosy perceptions of revered figures and say what others perceive to be the unsayable. Nevertheless, while frauds and charlatans do lap up undeserved praise, sometimes a person is revered because he or she genuinely deserve to be. With Mother Teresa this seems to be the case and this becomes only more apparent as Hitchens attempts to knock Mother Teresa off her pedestal and, despite the bombastic tone, fails to deliver in content. Senior figures  in the Vatican may have read this book (see his essay, ‘The Devil and Mother Teresa’ printed in [[ASIN:1560255803 Love, Poverty, and War: Journeys and Essays (Nation Books)]]) but I doubt the arguments presented here will persuade anyone other than those predisposed to getting a naughty thrill from sexual innuendos made at the expense of a dead nun.<br /><br />A fundamental problem with The Missionary Position is that Hitchens himself doesn’t seem to know who he is attacking. Is he criticising the Albanian nun, whom he dismisses as a fanatic and a fraud? Or is he attacking the media and general population for revering her as an icon of something Hitchens writes that she never really claimed to represent? Perhaps both, but he confusingly stumbles from conceding her honest religious sincerity and denouncing the world for making her into a secular saint for their own gratification, to accusing her of disguising her true motives and conning a gullible world into lapping up religious fundamentalism. What becomes very clear is that his attack on Mother Teresa is actually an attack on the Catholic Church, particularly its teachings on abortion and artificial contraception. So Mother Teresa was a pro-life Catholic? Well, tell us something we don’t know.<br /><br />The accusation that Hitchens repeats is that Mother Teresa was a friend of poverty rather than the poor. This is getting deep into the abstract as in the case of Calcutta it is a distinction without a practical difference.  For Hitchens Mother Teresa’s crime is that she did not peddle revolutionary slogans or give false materialist hope to those she worked with.  The fact that she offered the hope of eternal salvation only further angers her Trotskyist detractors. Mother Teresa could not end poverty in India or raise even a fraction of the destitute into a comfortable existence. The suggestion of Hitchens that she fund a first-class Western hospital in Calcutta betrays his total inability to seriously engage with the reality on the ground. What Mother Teresa did was to alleviate the suffering of the poor and respond to the situation as she found it. And for doing so she earned the love and gratitude of those she and her order assisted. At the risk of being cheap, one must ask what Hitchens and his fellow critics were doing to help the poor of India? It is certainly easier to sneer than to do anything oneself.<br /><br />The most serious accusation is her friendship with a crowd of unsavoury characters whom Hitchens claims received moral credibility in exchange for large donations to the Missionaries of Charity.  There is degree of truth in this claim but the ethics are significantly more nuanced than Hitchens describes. Mother Teresa met thousands of people. It was inevitable that some would not be of good moral character. There is little doubt that Jean-Claude Duvalier was exploiting Mother Teresa to bolster his criminal control over Haiti. Should Mother Teresa have refused financial assistance from him? A case for this can be made, but an equally valid case can be made that she had deal with sober reality. Would refusing money from a corrupt Government in Haiti assist the poor in that land or in Calcutta?  Mother Teresa’s mission relied on donations and she made the choice to accept money. Perhaps she should have denounced the regime in a similar manner to Pope John Paul II?  If so then we should put it down to her personal fallibility and not a moral failing much like we should charitably ascribe to Hitchens defence of tyrants such as Vladimir Lenin. On the other hand, Hitchens indignant insistence that the Missionaries of Charity should have returned money donated by the not-yet-convicted crook Charles Keating is ridiculous.  Why should the Missionaries of Charity, or in other honest recipient of Keating’s money, suffer for his crime?<br /><br />Hitchens has compiled the case for the prosecution against her sanctity and dedication to the poor:  The verdict must be a resounding affirmation in her favour. The evidence he levies against her is illogical, hypocritical and just plain ridiculous. Quite frankly this is not a serious book. It is a thoroughly unpleasant and nonsensical diatribe against a woman who devoted her life to the poor and who serves as a useful target for Hitchens anti-Catholic stick. The taste it leaves is as unpleasant as the Starbucks being consumed by those who lap it up.ailing much like we should charitably ascribe to Hitchens defence of tyrants such as Vladimir Lenin.

B000AP04OM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are excellent in it. The shots of Salzburg Austria are great. This is a great musical with great songs. It never gets old watching it. A great movie to watch with the whole family.
0452289963|5.0|I too have not read this book, but was reading through the reviews and came across Corina's review of the previous \\"God\\" review. I am so happy that we are are a point where we can be a part of a spiritual awakening or cleansing (whatever you chose to call it), and not have to have it be a Biblical idea.  There are wonderful people that care about themselves and others that may not live their lives by the Holy Bible.  I intend to buy this book and hope it has the impact on me that it has on so many others.
B0013DC5L0|4.0|I agree with Ron that this album is a different sound than their previous efforts.  However, I disagree on the FOB comparison.  To me, Simple Plan is following a similar musical track as Good Charlotte - both started off somewhat punk-pop/anti-social, and both of their latest offerings have a very pop sound influenced by the music from the 80's.  I suppose, given that they all grew up in the 80's, it shouldn't be a surprise that the influence is creeping into their sounds.      Overall, I like the album.  But, as Ron mentioned, if you're looking for their earlier sound, you might want to pass.  It's a good album on its own merits, but it's a departure from their earlier works - more pop, and more mature-sounding.
074356619X|5.0|anyone who read this book should know that this book is about opening your mind to your own power and believing that you can receive abundance, in any form---health, love, money, etc.  this is not about the universe \\"owing\\" us as one reviewer said, but about the universe wanting to provide for us when we need it.  be positive.  dont' go out and buy a yacht, but be in the mindset that you can have it, and deserve it if that is what you want.  if not a yacht, you may want your back to stop hurting---quit complaining, and believe your body well.  fyi-if you don't want to spend the money--rhonda byrne has a summary of the secret on her website and lots of free stuff.   peace and abundance to all.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|This is my first Rise Against album.  They have a pretty good sound but it's kind of generic.  The singer doesn't have good range so the songs start to sound the same after a while; kind of like Pennywise, Bad Religion, Social D singers.  They're OK, but without range the singing melodies can't be stretched or changed dramatically.  The music is generic rock.  It's heavy rhythm, little melody.  If you're looking for a masterpiece in this genre get Finch's \\"What it is to Burn\\".  But Sufferer and Witness is probably better than 80% of albums out there.  You'll enjoy it, but it's nothing revolutionary.
B000002BBY|3.0|Back in the day, Oasis wanted to be the next Beatles by attempting to write catchy, memorable songs.  Sometimes it worked, but other times it clearly didn't.  They certainly don't \\"sound\\" like the Beatles most of the time.    \\"Hello\\"- that chorus is totally ripped off from the chorus of an old Slade song called \\"Far Far Away\\".  The verse melody is alright, but the lyrics are bad.  Not a great way to open a supposed classic album.    \\"Roll With It\\"- annoying verse melody, good chorus.  Nothing more needs to be said.    \\"Wonderwall\\"- Not hooky enough to be a Beatles tribute.  Yes, mentioning the words \\"winding\\" and \\"roads\\" reminds us of a certain Beatles song, but that alone doesn't make it a quality tribute song.  Nah, they can do better than that.    \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\"- Is the piano part in the beginning stolen directly from John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\"?  It certainly sounds like it.  Nice attempt to cover that up with some guitar playing over it.  Can't fool me, though.   I like this song anyway.  The vocal melodies are beautiful, but the guitar solo isn't anything special.  Because of the somewhat sappy nature of the chorus, it's not a song I feel like playing very often.    \\"Some Might Say\\"- feels like a filler track to me.  Average verse melody, uninteresting chorus.  I guess some of the guitar work is decent enough.  I won't be playing this song anymore.  I can't imagine the Beatles ever writing something as uninteresting as this.  Repeating that underwhelming chorus over and over at the end was a bad idea too.    \\"Cast No Shadow\\"- maybe another filler track?  It's not anything special, that's for sure.  A verse melody that passes by harmlessly with absolutely nothing about it to help us remember the melody.  This album can't be the bands masterpiece with songs like this filling up time.  The way the verse melody is written reminds me of another song that escapes my mind at the moment.      She's Electric- bouncy pop song.  I like it a lot.  I was afraid after hearing the first few seconds that the melody was going to be a Byrds rip-off, but luckily the sound and melody changed direction in a hurry.  What we have here is a great taste of melodic songwriting.  The song almost has a sad atmosphere to it.  The chorus is a bit weak, but the verse melody totally makes up for that.    Morning Glory- the guitar playing in the beginning sounds a lot like Led Zeppelin's \\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\\".  The song transforms into a messy attempt at light grunge with unsatisfactory results.  Really bad singing makes it the obvious low point of the album.    Champagne Supervova- the intro has a very beautiful mellow sound that I wish would have continued longer.  I think this is a pretty good song in the beginning, with some quiet vocals and a nice atmosphere.  The song later becomes just another generic rock song with a loud bombastic sound that is totally unnecessary.
0446615625|2.0|The blurb on the back states that Balducci is \\"one of the world's most read writers\\", 20mil copies sold blah blah. If that's true, you would think that he would be at least a half decent writer......      Problemo Uno: How many freakin cardboard \\"characters\\" do we need in a cheap thriller?  a. The Camel Club itself has four or five members  b. Then there's a bunch of cops and Secret Service agents - Alex Ford, and his female (tough, Southern, daddy's little girl - original this ain't) partner, Simpson, not to be confused with his love interest, whatshername, who works for the Justice Department.   c.Then there are the bad guys - some arabs, some Americans, some soldiers, some CIA, some on the inside, some on the outside - and some other good guys.   d. Then there's also the president, who life is in danger, and his national security advisor, also key to the plot.     If you're not a lazy dumbass like me you can probably think a little and try and remember who everybody is. You could probably also add some non f-words to your everyday vocabulary too, but what's the point?     Probleme Deux: Sure many tomes in this genre are derivative, but this just feels like the taped together fag end in the bottom of a Friday night trash can. There is not one jaunty, original thought or sentence in this whole slock. For instance the Camel Club go to an old bookstore. \\"Reuben was inside reading a Dickens masterpiece\\". Right, buddy. Inspiring. Next time take the two minutes to Google a few Dickens titles and find one that might link to your plot. Paste it in. Or is it that they just go to the museum and look at a Van Gogh masterpiece, a John Moore masterpiece, read a Tolstoy masterpiece and then retire with some \\"fine whisky and a nice smooth cigar\\".....
B0010X73ZG|5.0|The Good Things:<br />-It seems to be influenced by HP Lovecraft; they are all otherworldly bugs and shapeless monsters.  Definately some of the freakiest monsters ever put on the screen.<br />-Also, special effects are pretty good.<br />-There are only a few bad scenes of violence, but they are exceptionally brutal, and serve to make everything scarier!<br />-Even scarier than the monsters are the people.  Most of the movie focuses on how everybody reacts to the situation, and there are many mixed and wild reactions.  Many people act dumb and irrationaly, and few are sensible.  This makes for very realistic and intense drama.<br />-As a whole, it is a deep, brutal exploration of human nature in an extreme apocalyptic situation.  The whole film is very thought-provoking.<br />-It's not corny or cliched like some of the other Stephen King works.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />-The ending was exceptionally brutal, and can be seen as either good or bad.  I think it could have had a happier ending, but as it is in the film, it does leave you thinking and feeling bitter.<br />-Sometimes, you just want to punch these stupid characters in the face (then again, this could be a good thing too, because the drama really absorbs the audience).<br />-From what I hear, it's not as accurate to the original book (especially with the ending).<br /><br />This definately goes above and beyond my expectations.  It's not the typical horror flick; it's an intense thought-provoking study of people under pressure.  The result is explosive, and unfortunately, highly believable.  Even though it is stylistically similar to \\"Dreamcatcher,\\" or \\"The Thing,\\" it is more akin to \\"Children of Men\\" or \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Because of this, it is frightening on all levels, and would consider this to be one of the best Stephen King-inspired films ever made.
B001041JKU|4.0|How do you top the greatest album of all time??? Well, simply, you don't.  And since many of us probably already have a few copies of the previously released versions of Thriller, I've chosen to concentrate soley on the new material.      The Girl Is Mine 2008 is perfection!  It's my absolute favorite. It can compete against the original.  It's got Michael singing all new and fresh versions of the verses and ad libs.  I was very impressed with the 2008 production of the track by Will.I.AM and his rap ad libs.    Wanna Be Startin Somethin 2008 is also a very nice change up to the original.  There are very subtle changes to the music, but still keeping that famous bass line.  Akon is a welcome addition bringing a 2008 Hip Hop feel and his own style assuring this track to be radio friendly.       PYT 2008 sounds nothing like the original--which is not a bad thing, as the original is a classic.  I like what Michael and Will.I.AM did with this one.  It's a very nice groove with a relaxed edge featuring Michael's championship falsetto.    Now, the bad news.  Beat It and Billie Jean, arguably 2 of Michael's biggest hits of all time, we're disappointing. To me, Beat It sounds like bad karaoke(a Simon Cowell quote). The track is a watered down version of the original, and Fergie is definitely out of her league. She tries to sing opposite Michael's orginal verses, line for line (not sure anyone can do that). And, it didn't feel like Kanye did anything to Billie Jean. He should've just told Mike he couldn't think of anything. It's not bad--just nothing more, nothing less, nothing really different.     Not a bad album to have, but Mike, how many times are you going to re-distribute THRILLER? Your fans hope this is the appetizer for something new.
B000VD5I94|3.0|good transfer. audio is good but nothing exceptional. bear in mind that this copy is bare bones. no special features. standard dvd comes 2 discs loaded with extras so I dont know whose idiotic idea was it not to include the same stuff on the blu ray release. but still this is the unrated directors cut and a must have.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|This is an amazing collection of music by someone new. Every time I listen I hear something new and exciting. There is more depth to the lyrics than one might initially expect and Sara's sound is infused with a mix of blues, rock and jazz. I hope this debut album is the start of another great artist.
1416523359|2.0|I've been a King fan since I was in highschool, indeed I own around 30 of his paperbacks. Some have been amazing (The Stand, Pet Semetary, The Dark Tower, The Shining, IT etc.) others really great as well (Salem's Lot, Needful Things, The Dark Half, Cell etc.) and then others I just couldn't get into (Bag of Bones comes to mind). Lisey's story falls into the latter category for me.    I've been reading it on and off for a couple months now. I keep getting frustrated and reading something else (just finished reading \\"1984\\" again). The book's sitting right there on my nightstand looking at me, daring me to read it.    The problem is that I keep zoning out while reading it. Lisey's internal thoughts and the back and forth is just getting plain annoying. Enough of the smucking and bools already. It gets old. Fast.    I'm not sure if I'll finish reading it. I might just pop it on my shelf and read Nightmares and Dreamscapes again. Now THAT is a great collection!
B000000W3G|5.0|I love this boxset. True, its based around the singles released from the album, but at the same time its all the extra's that come with it that make it so much more of an experiance, the book art and the b sides make it a nice (and now quite rare treat) for many SP fans, before their sound became truley lob-sided sounds with machina and machina II... let us not forget the horribleattempt of Corgan's [[ASIN:B00007M84Q Mary Star of the Sea]] and  [[ASIN:B000OQF6N6 Zeitgeist]]<br /><br />Get this if you a fan that discovered the true gem of their early 90's (and earlier) sound. it is a collectable and worth the pennies you spend on it.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I had the privelege of watching a screener of \\"Ark of Truth\\" recently and I must say, quite simply, it's amazing. It exceeded my already high expectations. It excels in terms of character, story, and direction. Long live all things Stargate!
0393307050|4.0|This is where it begins. Jack Aubrey becomes captain of the Sophie. He hires as his ship's physician Stephen Maturin. The two of them sail across the Mediterranean. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.    Ursula LeGuin recommends this book in Steering the Craft, a good manual for aspiring writers. I took her advice even if I had already seen the movie based on the book (and disliked it very much). I have to admit the book is nothing like the movie. The book makes the heroes, and the naval everyday life, much more vivid and real than the movie ever did. To be fair, the script was a ill-conceived attempt to remix several books from this series in one action-packed naval drama... Well, more is definitely less.    Back to the book: I can't say I loved the book. I have nothing to complain about. It is well written - the style seems to emerge right away from the early nineteen century, it is never boring and all characters show a true delicacy of feelings. But it feels like a very long introduction to a tale that will unfold in another book. It is a very long, and very beautiful, expository lump.    If you know right away that you're going to read several books from the series, well, I highly recommend this reading. If you want to read this one first and decide after where to go, well, I have mixed feelings. I guess I will read the sequel one of these days. Who knows? I could very well end up loving the series.

B00009V7T2|5.0|You either will love or hate the sound of Mars Volta, the high energy, experimental rock fusion sound that adapts is almost a reminder of what Led Zep must have sounded like to people when they came out, or when the beatlemania hit america. Something new, something different and full of energy.<br /><br />I admit I saw them live before i bought the CD in 04 at Big Day Out in Australia. I think they played some 3 songs in their hour long set, but it was possibly one of the best show's I've ever seen. I've been a fan since then (although not sure what they were doing with [[ASIN:B0007GAEW6 Frances the Mute]]) .<br /><br />A big suggestion to buy this album if you are into the sound At The Drive-In used to have, but with a bit more of a LSD trip added to it ;] Or like to listen to something different and addictive at the same time.
B000BT97AO|2.0|Mirror Mask is sold as part of a \\"trilogy\\" with Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.  I bought this expecting the same visual enjoyment of those movies and was very disappointed.    This film is very dark, with minimum colors, computer generated imagery, and the fantastic elements don't even begin until 20 minutes into the film.  Visually this has more in common with \\"Sky Captain\\" or \\"The City of Lost Children\\" then either of the Jim Henson movies.   Where Labyrinth and Dark Crystal can appeal to both children and adults, with vibrant colors, stunning imagery and puppets beginning almost immediately, \\"Mirror Mask\\" is practically monochromatic, with a story about a teenage girl who's mother is sick that just doesn't excite the watcher. The surreal quality of this DVD most children will probably find dull and the only musical interlude seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the story.    My advice, if you want a Jim Henson movie, don't get this.  If you want a fairy tale for adults with a simple story and visual effect that are a cross between Tim Burton and Picasso, then you may enjoy this.

I've read most of the existing fantasy stories and have seen the movies as well. I've studied Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell long and hard. As a leadership coach and consultant, I constantly try to support the underdeveloped metaphorical, symbolic approaches in people and organizations.<br /><br />Okay, actually, I'm a PUSH-OVER when it comes to fantasy.

B0011FL7FA|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies ever. Not only is the storyline great, but the director managed to gather a fresh cast. This movie is definately worth buying and the soundtrack is just as great! It didn't hurt to have such gorgeous cast members also, especially Jim Sturgess. If you want to see a movie that recreates a little history with some more unique storylines then you should check it out. It's gotten great reviews from critics which is also a plus. Just go see it for yourself!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series was beautifully crafted and thoroughly imaginative, and it is SO wonderful to have the few episodes we were ever given all on DVD!  I've shown this series to several people who didn't feel enthused about watching it, but came away from the experience loving the show (and hating me for getting them hooked on something that isn't on TV anymore).  A must-have!
1400082773|5.0|Then you should read this book. This is a fascinating view into the complex, impressive person now running for president, focusing on his coming to terms with his absent father and the color of his skin in America--not only what it means but what it does NOT mean. It was written well before he ran for political office (he was just out of Harvard Law School as the first African American president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review), so I believe he really wrote it himself.  It is very personal, not at all self serving, thoughtful, and it seems deeply honest. I have seen other reviews that criticize the book because he doesn't speak much about his mother.  My view is that his mother (and his grandparents) are between the lines on every page of the book. Their love, values, and support were the foundation of his life--the rock on which he stood to ask these questions about his father.  He didn't write about them because he didn't need to write about them--his relationship with them was unambiguous.

B001041JLE|5.0|Thriller will withstand the test of time. Michael is a genius, he is so  talented, nobody can touch him. I have loved him since I was a child and I  always will. I don't believe any of the things they accused him of. The media set out to destroy him because it was a story they could sell and that's all they care about. His music and talent will live forever and they can never take this away from him. I agree that he didn't need any of these other artists, his songs and music can stand on their own and in my opinion they just take away from his music rather than add anything to it.They can't hold a candle to him. Go Michael

B00005JPXY|4.0|All is well at the going away party for Rob (Stahl-David).  The next day he is heading to Japan, but tonight he is having fun with his friends.  Those closest to him are his brother Jason (Vogel), Lily (Lucas), Marlena (Caplan), and Hud (Miller).  Hud is videotaping the events when all hell breaks loose outside in downtown New York.  Buildings fall down, others explode, and the Statue of Liberty's head comes rolling down the street.  Hud keeps the camera rolling because \\"people will want to know what happened.\\"  Soon it becomes apparent that the source of the commotion is a giant monster that is scared and apparently immune to anything the army uses against it.  Rob  and his gang must rescue Rob's crush Beth (Yustman) and get out of town before the army takes extreme action.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" is \\"Godzilla\\" meets \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".  The hand-held camera approach brings a fresh experience to the monster in a big city story.  Some may dislike the jittery camerawork, but it adds an immediacy to the story and makes you feel like you are in it.  The movie doesn't cheat either with shots of the monster.  It is shown in all its ugly glory a number of times from a distance and very close up.  It is like no movie monster previously, and it is a scared creature making its way through a strange world.  And that only makes him more dangerous.  \\"Cloverfield\\" is a fresh take on an old story, and I recommend checking it out.

Music of great power, gentle sweetness, masterful, thought provoking lyrics, supreme dynamics and Brandi's emotional, powerful, gentle, sweet vocals.  Brandi, Tim, & Phil's music reaches deep within & elicits numerous emotions, the most prevelant being pleasure. Buy it and life will be a little sweeter!
B000ZK4466|3.0|I've saved writing this review for a while now. The first time I put the album on I couldn't get past the first 3 songs without wanting to bash my head in. The Mars Volta hits us with some ridiculous, always full speed, stupidly noisy, music that I really couldn't get into easily. I hope you like drums that are always going fast and loud and not subtle at all, ever, because that's what you will be getting among other things.<br /><br />Sooo over the next week I kept playing it, giving Volta the benefit of the doubt (after all this is the band that gave us Comatorium). But this album never grew on me like Frances the Mute or Amputechture did (two great albums, even with their mood building) There is just so much noise and crap happening that it is obnoxious. I can't believe some people are saying this is their best album since Comatorium... ridiculous. On this album The Mars Volta abandoned all subtlety and added more noise and speed drumming. Cedric's voice seems like it is never being run through some kind of modifications... sad because the album would be a lot more bearable if we could here some of his natural voice. The mixing/production was also not to my liking... seems like they turned up the low end and nerfed the electric guitar.<br /><br />Phew, after saying all that, there are still some great stuff on the album... it's just that the bad overshadows it. This album simply lacks any kind of flow. I love the Mars Volta, can't wait to see them live and to buy their next record. I hope its more like \\"LVia LViaquez\\" though.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is an album for people who enjoy excellence in the rock genre and who have not forfeited their capacity to think about contemporary political affairs.  After hearing of this album's release on a self-proclaimed conservative radio talk show and the almost hateful blasting it received, I thought I should hear it for myself.  I bought it the next day in Starbuck's.  The discrepancy between the description of the radio announcer and product could not have been more pronounced.    Music in a Patriotic Tradition    The album is in the best tradition of American patriotic protest and folk ballads (albeit set to a beat).  It was written, produced, and sung by an American citizen who clearly regards himself as just that --a citizen -- rather than the subject of a government.  There was after all, no more fundamental premise or value behind the origins of this country and its rebellion against George III, than appeal to the norms and idea of citizenship as opposed to being subjects of a governmental apparatus currently in power. And so it was with considerable irony, most especially coming from a self-proclaimed conservative, that I recalled the comments of this talk show radio announcer the previous evening.  For my parents, conservatism meant standing for principles and values that go back to the roots of the American Republic.  Apparently for some on talk radio today, conservatism simply means conformity with the party line.  While that has been a criterion of patriotism in other places and times, it has never before been a criterion of American patriotism.   Indeed, it's difficult for me to imagine a less patriotic stance in America than that of this self-proclaimed patriot on supposedly conservative talk radio and that of his vitriolic callers.  In the concluding line of \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" included on this CD, Springsteen manages to make the point in an understated poetic fashion, \\"Your flag it flew so high, It drifted into the sky.\\"    A Patriotism that must give hope today for our Watching Forefathers    To Bruce Springsteen's question, \\"Is there anyone alive out there?\\" I would only add, \\"is there anyone out there on talk radio (and any regular following they apparently have) who thinks anymore?\\"  A republic can only endure so much of a loss in capacity to think critically and survive as a republic.  As our founders understood very well, any republic is a precarious creation. The longest recorded durations in history have been in the neighborhood of two hundred years.  These histories were studied closely by our founders.  When Benjamin Franklin was descending the stairs in Philadelphia at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, he was asked by a bystander, \\"what type of government do we have?\\"  His answer went straight to the point:  \\"a republic sir, if you can keep it.\\"  The founding fathers were keenly aware that a republic is incapable of enduring apart from a citizenry that retains the capacity to think critically for itself.  Masses do not deliberative democracies make.  And partisan self-righteousness linked with blindness to historical trends only increases the probability of cyclical historical recurrence, this time under the watch of our generations.  The only immediate counterweight to the decay of republics as a form of government is an alive citizenry.  This citizen makes his views known through his music yet is devoid of preaching at others; his questioning of dominant governmental policies and patterns, his demonstrated capacity for grounded scenario thinking as expressed in song, and appeal to reflective thought on the part of his listeners is whole, direct, and personal.    Beyond the Ideologues of Right and Left    It's a remarkable commentary on what appears an accelerating political and social decadence in our time that a review of a musical album in the finest traditions of American patriotism (not to mention musical craftsmanship) should come under this kind of attack and call for such a preface in a review of its music.  This is an album that will please neither ideologues of left or right.  For the ideological left, it will be far too concerned with what they may view as idiosyncratic situations of people rather than hard-hitting on their key talking points.  For the ideological right, it's an album that -- albeit almost entirely symbolically -- takes a position that disagrees with their own.  It endorses the facile solutions promoted by neither side of contemporary ideological diatribes.  There seems to exude from this album a call for something deeper than the self-contained ideological thought and practices of any stripe.  When either dominant political party skirts rapidly over or places itself above the reflective and deliberative practices fundamental for the sustenance of a viable republic, it should not be surprising to find ourselves in quandaries such as we find ourselves today.        For an audience who still thinks, Magic takes the listener through \\"three minute\\" snapshots of the impact of the Iraq war on real people.  Unlike ideologues of right or left, there's no arrogant pretension in this album to an omniscient view.  What makes this album worth listening to is precisely the lack of any such pretense.  What it offers rather is common sense perspectives and questions grounded in experiences of the music's characters who experience the war or its consequences at the ground level.  It offers poetic metaphors that may stimulate thought and invite listeners to make their own sense of the situation.  It offers an articulation in lyric and song of points of view that will be recognizable by many who today are compelled to deal with realities in their immediate life space created by the Iraqi War.      Listen to the Music and Think for Yourself    On listening to the music, I first played it through and found that I alternatively tapped my foot to the music on the faster songs (e.g., \\"Livin' in the Future\\") and listened most closely to thewords on the more melodic songs (e.g., \\"Magic\\").  I enjoyed the music, but felt like I missed a lot in the songs so played it again, this time following the words in the (nicely done) booklet accompanying the album.  Although there are no proper nouns in the album, situational and metaphorical references to the Iraqi War in the album as a whole are clear enough to anyone living in this time period.  Nevertheless, based on the radio report I'd heard, I was surprised to see how much the album relied on poetic metaphor rather than upon any explicit references.  Moreover, much of the symbolism is subtle and I did not understand it on my first or second reading.  Where were the \\"Bush-hating\\" lyrics as advertised on talk radio?  It seems that statements by such radio hosts are much better understood as projected portrayals of their own suppositions and mindsets in the face of disagreements rather than useful characterizations of the topic they purportedly are addressing.      After the third time listening, I just put Magic on continuous replay for the rest of the evening.  I ended up staying up too late.  As I went about my evening, I felt I was still missing things in the subtly crafted symbolism and was enjoying the music too much to want it to stop.  It's a music that just continued growing on me.  I enjoyed it more the last time through then on the first play of the evening.      Although I wrote these notes right at the time of the album's release, I never got around to posting them.   The Magic Tour has recently been scheduled for a 2008 run, so perhaps posting these thoughts may still be a timely and useful reference for some.      In Sum    I recommend this album heartily for fans of good rock and roll music.  And for thinking people whose mindsets have not been pre-formed by the \\"grand narratives,\\" or -- to borrow a lyric from one of the bonus songs on Springsteen's equally powerful \\"Seeger Sessions\\" folk album - by the \\"gleam in someone's eye\\" of those ideologues in formal positions of power and on the airwaves of today, whether of right or left political formation.  In the spirit of prophets of old, the music in this album calls upon people to think afresh, \\"who are the Pharisees hiding behind cloaks of self-righteousness today?\\"  This album at once issues a poetic warning call to those with ears to hear and is a celebration in song, providing high quality grist for the mill for those who happen to enjoy good rock and roll music, who are alive to dilemmas of the historical epoch in which we live, and who have not forfeited their native capacity to reflectively think for themselves (and who at the same time thereby enable, within some sphere of influence, the objective possibility of meaningful deliberation with others).

If George Martin needs money I'll send him twenty bucks but please leave the classics alone.

The sex scenes are hot but not scandelous, the fight scenes are action packed but not gory. I can't wair for season 2!!!

B000001EEN|3.0|This is one of the many reasons I continue to invest in CD's after their early 80's<br />Inception. Firstly sound-quality has leaped in dynamics, and of course \\"expanded\\" and \\"remastered\\" certainly IS a benefit to the longer play format.<br /><br />And this along with titles like \\"Live at Leads\\", and Dylan's \\"Bootleg\\" series makes these releases even more valuable for everyone not just collectors and<br />rarity-philes.<br /><br />I remember first finding this in the LP Vinyl cutout bin 35 odd years ago (along with the Blind Faith album) and immediately spotting Jesus/God playing a Strat. But the songs seemed a bit scattered and I couldn't't see the \\"flow\\" potential. And of course where was \\"Layla\\"?<br /><br />But just like \\"Live at Leads\\" we are certainly blessed by the re-representation of the \\"Big Picture\\".  And see what and hear what didn't make the grade at the time. This is Clapton's saving grace album and cheers for Pete Townsend for piecing Eric's puzzle back together. 461 Ocean Boulevard was yet conceived and we all were still yet to absorb fully Derek's Dominoes.<br /><br />In retrospect reading the recent reviews of Led Zeppelin '07, this concert started off a bit ragged. \\"Layla\\" does turn out to be a tragedy... But the building momentum and surety comes on as the concert develops. Cheers to Townsend for NOT sounding \\"WHOish\\" and bless his heart for putting the show on in the first place. But Ronnie Wood, contrary to his entertaining bio, does NOT at all mirror even closely the fluid \\"slide\\" of Duane Allman. But still certainly a great document of Eric's resurrection.

B000Y2WAL6|5.0|The EELS.<br /><br />You love 'em or hate 'em -- there is no middle ground.  Their offbeat style of alternative rock with either soothe your soul or abrade it.  I am in the former camp.  I love the Eels, can't get enough of this intelligent, catchy stuff. Mark Oliver Everett (otherwise known as E) IS the Eels -- no disrespect to the other fine musicians in the band.  His presence just overshadows the rest.  That is not a bad thing, and the music always comes together in a way that makes it seem like it had to be just so -- all elements from vocals to instrument blend perfectly, nothing overshadowing anything else.  At the center of it all is E and his raspy, emotional, insightful and intelligent lyrics. They are the glue that holds the songs together.<br /><br />I digress, this is supposed to be a review of the Trinkets album.  Well, all of what I just wrote still applies.<br /><br />This is a wonderful collection for the fans, less so for Eels newcomers.  For them I would say start with their studio albums (like [[ASIN:B00004NJL4 Daisies of the Galaxy]] and [[ASIN:B00000DF6N Electro-Shock Blues]]) and fall in love with them that way.  For the rest of us, this is a treasure trove of rare tracks and alternate takes that Eels fans will eat up!  Not every song has the amazing production quality of the Eels studio albums, but for the most part they are quite good.  Picking favorites out of the 50 collected tracks is a daunting task.  If you are an Eels fan then you know different tracks will resonate more for you on different days.  With each disc clocking in at around 75 minutes, there is plenty to enjoy.  Live tracks are fun to hear...often getting different treatment than the studio versions.  The Moog version of \\"Novocain for the Soul\\" is a favorite of mine, as is the rockier version of \\"Mr. E's Beautiful Blues\\" at the beginning of disc 2 and covers like \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" and  \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\"<br /><br />The presentation is wonderful, a richly designed 4-fold digipack with photos from most of the Eels eras.  The accompanying book has tons of photos and concept art, and E's commentary about each of the tracks makes the experience all the more enjoyable and enlightening.  Also fun is the 6 track Lollapalooza 2006 live performance DVD where the band really rocks out.  The hijinks of the \\"security guard\\" is also fun to watch.  It is an interesting contrast considering the Eels with Strings that was to follow.<br /><br />All in all, this double CD set does an admirable job of gathering rarities from the Eels first 10 years.  I would recommend it to any fan of E and the Eels.  I'd also like to recommend [[ASIN:B000C20VJG Eels with Strings - Live at Town Hall]], one of the best concert DVDs I've seen in a while.  It makes a nice companion for Trinkets, and their greatest hits so far compilation, [[ASIN:B000Y2WAKM Meet the Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1]].  New-fans should probably start with Meet the Eels before moving on to this album.<br /><br />4.5 Stars.  Here's looking forward to 10 more innovative years!s from most of the Eels eras.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This show first aired when I was still in High School.

0446691437|4.0|The War of Art<br /><br />This is a quick-read book filled with a series of essay-like entries. The emphasis is on recognizing \\"resistance\\" when facing the daunting challenges of unlocking one's creative potential. Examples from philosophy, mythology, history, movies and psychology provide some interesting backdrops as Pressman takes us on an exploratory ride through museful territory.<br /><br />The book is rather simplistic and for those who are well rehearsed in the aforementioned, you might find this bordering on tedium or view it as cliff notes for the uninspired. The author gives us  many reasons why we should indulge in creative impulses without being hindered by the ego. The strength in this book lies in its personal tone and its ability to maintain one's interest due to the brevity of the entries and the various anecdotes from the author's personal trials and tribulations as a writer. It is not mired in esoteric spiritual offerings, rather Pressfield gives us down to earth advice on how to access our individual creative voices by accepting fear and other perceived inhibitions as part of the journey to artistic freedom.<br /><br />I was particularly struck by his examination of William Blake's quote: \\"Eternity is in love with the creations of time\\"--Pressfield views artistic inspiration as something ineffable; material defined by some higher power-- flowing in some timeless chaos just ready to be materialized by the receptive mind.  Then he discusses the importance of overcoming the limitations of our egos in order to tap into the self--or a spectrum of our being that allows us to create, evolve and engage in a state of creative malleability.<br /><br />It's all easier said than done as discipline seems to be the main device needed to realize one's creative muse rather than being thunderstruck by an idea. I don't agree with Pressman's idea that artists are \\"modest\\" or that \\"non creative people hate creative people\\", but he does drive home a message about going against conventional wisdom that only a few gifted folks can be artistic. He urges all of us to follow our creative impulses and to reject the limitations of ego-driven thinking by just doing it, regardless of the outcome. And that these labors, if driven by the love of the process will be infused with creative passion rather than the desire for material gain.<br /><br />There are some idealistic, almost pretentious ideas here, but at the same time, one must dive into the arts with some idealism in place as a means of overcoming the fears, barriers and \\"resistance\\" that Pressman speaks eloquently about.m that only a few gifted folks can be artistic.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney Spears has grown up and produced a fabulous, trendy, sexy, lively album.  This is by far the best, most original work she has done to date.  Just as she lost control in her personal life, she lost control here, and her chaotic, \\"freak\\" side took over.  She isn't afraid to say or do anything, which is one definition of insanity.      Although the work by the producers and the other musicians is brilliant, her ingrained professionalism gives way to her own voice, and her ferocious intensity breaks through.  She is the Sylvia Plath of pop, self-destructive and almost afraid of herself.  It is absolutely amazing that a \\"pop princess\\" could have such power.    After the unabashed raunchiness of some of the earlier songs, the last \\"ballad\\" is a masterpiece of disillusionment and stoic toughness.

It's a wonderful book for anyone's continued process toward positive growth.
B000YENUI6|4.0|******* SPOILER ALERT! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE! *******  Great, absorbing, extremely well-made gangster film. Uses the same basic framework as Road to Perdition (another superb gangster flick) but only because its an ancient plot as old as drama itself: The triangle of old king, incomplete son & loyal soldier. The dissolute son commits an unforgiveable transgression that forces the aging king to sacrifice the steadfast soldier. Or at least attempt to sacrifice him since the soldier is so resourceful he gives everyone a run for their money before the end of the story. This version is beautifully done & perfectly cast. Viggo Mortensen is fantastic & very economical - not a wasted line or gesture. But the rest of the cast is just as good. Frequently the accents are a weak point of a film, but not this one. The accents in EP sound pitch-perfect & never waver. It also seems a lot of research was done & it pays off big-time, giving this movie a very creepy look. For a truly weird experience, try the Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia, Volumes 1 & 2. Its a tiny glimpse into a totally alien & incomprehensible world. American prison tattoos are pretty scary, but the Russian versions are even worse, if that's possible. Anyway, EP features some of the best acting ever & some startling twists in the screenplay. There's also one of the all-time great  cinematic double-crosses when the Russian godfather sets up Viggo Mortensen's character by having him initiated & tattooed suitably just so he can be used as a sacrificial lamb/substitute for his son in a murder attempt. This film is actually a fascinating character study since there's only a small amount of violence. The threat of bloodshed overhangs the entire movie but its really used very sparingly & strictly for effect. There's never a single gun to be seen but these mobsters get their point across regardless. I gave this film 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the ending, which is unworthy of the rest of the movie. Its almost as if David Cronenberg couldn't bring himself to kill Nikolai off so he came up with an unsatisfactory ending that allowed him to live. Traditionally, the loyal soldier dies tragically at the end, heroic to the last. But did Cronenberg foresee a sequel or two? Hard to say. But regardless of its ending, this film is clearly worth seeing and/or owning. The acting & all the rich detail alone make it a true classic of any genre, crime or otherwise.
B000035P5E|5.0|This is based on a great novel by Ken Follett and one of the best WWII spy novels I have enjoyed..Follett is a master.    Though often falls short of books, this one doesn't. Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan turn in great performances.    If you liked the book this is worth seeing.

B000VNMMPM|5.0|People who are fans of Luc Besson know he has a style and theme he likes to use often.  Be it the socially inexperienced hitman who takes a young girl under his wing and saves from evil DEA agents (The Professional), or be it a tough taxi driver who protects an alien (Fifth Element) or be it Angel-A where a woman who seems to be an Angel decides to help out and protect a broken man who's brought his own problems on himself but can't seem to stop it, Luc is an expert of the \\"I'm in trouble, help me\\" \\"Now I have help when and where I least expected it\\" kind of movie.    But Angel-A has moved him into a new level.  While I've been a very long time fan of The Professional with Jean Reno and Gary Oldman, and while his other movies are good but not quite as good as that one, Angel-A finally hit the emotion he's been trying to reach again for so long.    My girlfriend and I watched Angel-A together, and we liked it so much I bought two copies from Amazon (one for her to carry around and one for me to keep in library).  We watched it twice and talked about it for quite a while.    It's a beautiful movie.
0688172377|5.0|I purchased Desert Flower about five years ago from a street vendor in Brooklyn. I'd have to admit that I purchased the book simply because of the pretty face on the cover. I recently grabed the book of the shelf to read the story behind that pretty face.  Oh! my God.  I can't remember the last time I was touch by a story like this one.  It's been a week since I've read the book and I'm still trying to get it out of my system.     Scream in silence is the first thing that came to my mind when I heard what these women are going through in Somalia and other countries that pratice female Genital Mulitation.  To deny a woman of something so natural and beautiful, I think is the worst act ever commited against women.  It's as if the women are there only to service the men:  cooking their food, washing their clothes, taking care of their children and she's still obligated to satisfy him sexually regardless whether or not she enjoys it in the process.      Loveless sexless and most of all painfull is the best way I can describe these countries that practice Female Genital Mutilation.  Shortly after these women are born, they're sexually mutilated , and have to deal with all the medical complications that follows:  From trouble urinating, severe menstual cramps, painful sexual intercourse and painfull childbirth.  Pain seems to play a major roll in just about every aspect of their lives.  These women are hurting and and screaming in silence.    A woman's body is very delicate and sensitive.  Without provation women sometimes experience or develop problem with their sexual organs. So, why make matters worst?    As the old saying goes, people will only go as far as you allow them. until These women work up the strength and say enough! is enough! and also recognize that they're the one with the power This nonsense will continue. Throughout history men have been known to buy, beg for sex and sometimes take it involuntary. That in itself should give these women strength to standup to these men and stop multilating their daughters to satisfy these selfish men.  These women should take control of their  mind and body.    Waris is definitely a child of God.  There is a special purpose for hebeing here on this earth.  It was not by accident that she made it safely out the desert and jungle after encountering a lion.  Waris has achieve what many women will never achieve, a successful modeling career and inspite of her situation, gave birth to a healthy son without complications.  Keep on counting your blessing Waris.  The Lord is not done with you yet.
0805079831|1.0|One word can describe this text, \\"Misleading.\\"    Anybody with a respectable amount of knowledge on the subject of economics would know that capitalism as it is practiced around the world today is a hybrid system with strong elements of socialism mixed in.  A true free market system and capitalism thus are not the same thing.  Ms. Klein vilifies Milton Friedman for his advocacy of capitalism, but Dr. Friedman never saw any economic system rise up in his lifetime that completely reflected his personal ideals.  The economic system that most closely resembled what he proposed was Hong Kong before 1997.  Why is nobody complaining about disparities and inequality in Hong Kong?      Ms. Klein attributes many bad things that happened in \\"capitalist\\" societies to Dr. Friedman's philosophy, when most of those admittedly bad things resulted from policies and situations that Dr. Friedman preached against, such as special interest protections, secretive dealings, etc.  What about the bad things that happened in countries where the state controlled the economy? Dr. Friedman argued that, though capitalism isn't perfect, it most closely resembles the free-market system he would prefer.  And, of all the systems employed in countries around the world, no other system has benefited the lot of the average person more than capitalism.  Capitalism is not perfect, and a Utopia does not and will not ever exist.  Capitalism, however is more perfect than Socialism.  How many East Germans were willing to risk their lives to cross over into the capitalist West Germany?  And how many West Germans dreamed of living in Socialist East Germany?  Where would you rather have lived?  Dr. Friedman had nothing to do with Pinochet's crimes.  If anything, the power of Dr. Friedman's ideas convinced Pinochet to relinquish some of his power in order to institute pension reforms.  What Dr. Friedman did in Chile was a good thing, not a bad thing.  When he was invited to Chile to advise the government, what should he have done, declined?  How would that have been a good thing?  If George Bush began accepting advice on the Iraq war from Noam Chomsky, would you call Chomsky a Bush supporter?    If you read this book, at least give one of Dr. Friedman's books a chance.  His writing style is very easy to follow.      !!!!WARNING to all Naomi Klein fans!!!!!  Milton Friedman is notorious for presenting his arguments articulately and persuasively.  If you think you can be convinced by arguments rife with reason and logic and like your beliefs spoon-fed to you, do not read Milton Friedman's writings.  Dr. Friedman's reasoning has a tendency to cause the reader to reconsider his notions of fairness, rightness, freedom, tyranny, wealth, government, choice, autonomy, and greed.

B0000026DJ|5.0|More than anything else, Diesel and Dust seems like a love letter to the land, people, and culture of Australia.  Some of the songs explore themes familiar to long time listeners of the band, such as the anti-war \\"Put Down That Weapon\\", but for the most part the album is a well crafted look at the culture of Australia that Midnight Oil wanted to protect and defend (\\"Bullroarer\\").  This is the \\"land of wide open spaces\\" referred to on 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1's \\"Maralinga\\", a precious commodity being encroached upon by the modern world (\\"Warakurna\\", \\"Dreamworld\\").  It's also a land of traditions and cultures maligned (\\"Beds Are Burning\\", \\"The Dead Heart\\").  Midnight Oil reminds us not to give up what is most precious to us, that the fight is always worth the effort (\\"Sell My Soul\\") even if we get knocked around a little (\\"Sometimes\\").  Not only are these messages delivered with poignant, insightful lyrics, but with stirring anthemic music, evocative of the very land they champion.  This was a masterpiece when it was released and it has stood the test of time.  One need not be Australian to get the point of these songs.  Change the place names to cities and deserts in the States (or any other country) and the message remains the same.  Protect what you have before its gone, embrace your cultural roots, and fight for what you hold dear.
B000ZK4466|5.0|People either like something or they don't. They either GET IT or they don't. Different people like different things, it's that simple. I LOVE The Mars Volta for thier sheer audacity and complexity and yes, this is extremely complex music. The pervasive attitude amongst a lot of hardcore fans now is that the band stumbled with 06's \\"Amputechture\\" and rushed out \\"Bedlam...\\" to offset the negative reaction to that CD which in my opinion, is pure nonsense, \\"Amputechture\\" was the best thing they've ever done. This new release is both an extension and refinement of past albums that doesn't dilute the band's careening sound by adding a few new sonic touches such as distorted, otherwordly vocal effects, wailing free jazz sax and fewer extended, mood building passages. While I miss some of those old quirks (the silence and dissonance washed happily over my brain) the tighter song structures and heavier riffs work to brilliant effect and should broaden the groups appeal considerably. The Mars Volta still make no concessions to mainstream tastes and will likely NEVER gain any major radio play but that seems a small sacrifice to make for such willfully difficult, ingenious, genre bending and rewarding, beautiful music. This is the real sound of rock in the 21st century. This mercilessly beats any other working band in music by miles! Another Keeper in an already stellar catalogue. Everyone else....try to keep up!
B000Y179KO|4.0|This review is being written after listening to this album regularly for over 4 months. There is a mega-ton of achingly beautiful harmonies here, along with a few songs that only slightly diminish this overall top-notch effort. Nobody sounds like or does it like the Eagles ,if you love them and know them, I think you will understand the gift they were giving their long-time fans, something familiar and re-assuring but heartfelt and completely sincere, from an old friend. I am surprised that in these reviews that there aren't more comments on the jaw-dropping  production values and fidelity of the recordings, this always is a big plus to encourage repeated listenings. For those who say that the Eagles have lost their edge, #1 listen closely to Joe Walsh's searing and spot-on solos throughout, particularly on \\"Big Picture\\" , #2 this album is a  solid progression standing squarely on the shoulders and building from their previous records. I believe in years to come when we go back and listen to this album,we will experience renewed appreciation of how ridiculously superb this record actually is. It is destined to join the classics.
B000002LOE|4.0|The two previous albums by REM brought the band to the notice of radio, making them headliners in large venues throughout the country.  The momentum would continue with \\"Out Of Time\\" the album that would push them over the top into superstar status.  The singles \\"Loosing My Religion\\" and \\"Shiny Happy People\\" were all over MTV getting played dozens of times nationally every single day.  Although vastly overplayed \\"Loosing My Religion\\" is still a great pop tune and one of the best singles the band ever released.  Overall though I feel this album is a step down for REM.  The album starts out with a rap from KRS one in \\"Radio Song\\" which sounds pretty dated today.  Actually my favorite song on the album is one of the two that bassist Mike Mills sings in \\"Texarkana\\".  It is great little tune.   Kate Pierson from the B-52's appears all over the album on backup and occasional lead vocals.  Her voice works well with Michael Stipe, but a lot of this material is much more pop oriented than REM fans might have been used to.  One positive note found the band using a lot wider instrumentation on this album.  Mandolin, strings, and other non-traditional instruments began to appear on this disc, and would be used much more effectively on their next one.  Overall this is an album that a lot of people love, and I still like it ok, but I think several other REM albums are better.
0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs, by far, is considered one of those classic comedies.  Anyone in my generation who grew up watching Star Wars will love this movie.  Spaceballs primarily draws from Star Wars, but it has other sci-fi sequences in there as well, such as Aliens and Planet of the Apes.  Granted the latter are simply given a scene to joke on, but they still had their moments.<br /><br />If, by some miracle of existence, you haven't seen Star Wars, you probably shouldn't watch this movie because it won't make as much sense and it will just seem totally random.  Spaceballs has an extremely funny and witty script, which is what one expects from any Mel Brooks product.  Most people who enjoy this film will find the jokes memorable and easily quotable, such as \\"they've gone so fast they went plaid\\"; for something that goes beyond light speed.  Other moments, like when they actually take out a copy of Spaceballs the movie DURING the movie to see what happened in a prior scene was absolutely hilarious to me.  In retrospect, now that we have DVD players, it will be even funnier to watch the movie when you get to that scene.  I picture having children in the future asking me what VHS was, kind of like kids of my generation wonder what 8-tracks are.<br /><br />The casting for the film was perfect as well.  Casting Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet was sheer genius and I'm glad he did this movie.  I can't think of a more absurd acting/actor combo to parody Darth Vader.  I will say at this juncture that the only character that I didn't really like was Mel Brook's as the President.  For some reason, most of his scenes in this role were pretty dry; the main humor came from the interaction of everyone else when he wasn't around.  And I don't think anyone will ever forget the capture of the Stunt Doubles when Dark Helmet was chasing after Lonestar and Princess Vespa.<br /><br />All in all, this is a classic comedy film.  I think it can easily be enjoyed by more than one generation, not like a lot of comedies being released today like American Pie.  I think that will fall under the stamp of purely generational humor, which isn't the sign of a timeless comedy.  I know it's on point right now and might be for a little while, but when compared against something like Spaceballs there just isn't any competition.  Not to mention I think the humor and script are more well written in Spaceballs.  If you're a fan of Mel Brooks' films, or a fan of Star Wars, you really can't go wrong with this parody.ed today like American Pie.  I think that will fall under the stamp of purely generational humor, which isn't the sign of a timeless comedy.

B000002UW1|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to REM.  They were the darlings of the alternative music press after the release of their first album \\"Murmur\\" in the early 80's and steadily grew a more mainstream following with each sequential release.  I kept reading about them and thinking about giving them a try, but it was not until this their 4th studio album that the band hooked me.  \\"Document\\" is an album that divides fans of the band.  This was the first album that saw REM gain any significant mainstream attention producing two big hits in the dark often misinterpreted \\"The One I Love\\" and the frantic \\"It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\".  Older fans screamed \\"sellout\\" and indeed this would be the bands last album on an independent label.  For me I think it is a great disc and filled with quirky yet satisfying songs.  Full of jangling guitars and politically charge lyrics REM are able to capture a picture of the American 80's.  Along with the singles the album is full of great songs:  \\"Finest Worksong\\", \\"Welcome To The Occupation\\", \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\", \\"Lightnin Hopkins\\", \\"King Of Birds\\", and the aptly titled \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\".
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's house, and knew I had to buy it. It's got drama, action, romance, etc. Robert Downy Jr. and Val Kilmer are a hilarious duo.
1577314808|2.0|I consider myself extremely fortunate. I experienced the moment of \\"enlightenment\\" or \\"awakening\\", as it's called, at a time in my life not too long ago when it seemed as though all my options in this world had run out. I suddenly saw myself, as well as everyone and everything around me, in ways I could never have imagined before that moment. I realized that nothing bad could ever happen to me, that there was no reason to fear anything, because the \\"me\\" it would happen to didn't exist! There was no more reason to desire anything because everything around me IS me, and I am the same as everything around me! It's all just a crazy illusion that our minds are incapable of seeing through, and it's this illusion that creates all of our suffering. See beyond the illusion and the suffering ends. Or, at least, it's much easier to manage.    There's nothing \\"religious\\" about this. Albert Einstein was well aware of this illusion. He went so far as to say that humanity's very survival rests on \\"liberation from the self\\", and called our experience of ourselves as separate from everything else \\"a kind of optical delusion of consciousness\\".    Unfortunately, it's a powerful delusion, and prior to my moment of awakening, if someone had come to me with talk of \\"enlightenment\\" and this idea that I was somehow not what I thought I was, that I was causing my own suffering by not realizing the \\"True Self\\" within me, I would have immediately labelled them a new age religious nut job and tuned them out. This is why I consider myself so incredibly fortunate that the worst moment of my life turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me.    Since then, I've been trying to learn everything I can about the \\"True Self\\", that universal energy which is in everyone and everything and is beyond all human comprehension (which admittedly makes learning about it a bit of a problem, but I still like to read people's ideas on it). For the past year or so, I've been studying and practicing Zen, I've read book after book by Jack Kornfield, Thich Nhat Hanh, D.T. Suzuki, the Dalai Lama, Alan Watts, and other equally insightful but lesser known authors. I've studied Hinduism, read essays by Albert Einstein, and been captivated by the teachings and studies on world mythology by Joseph Campbell, clearly one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.    And then, I came across Echkart Tolle, thanks in no small part to the recent announcement of Oprah's new Book Club selection, \\"A New Earth\\". I'm not a fan or follower of Oprah, but somehow I heard about her latest Book Club selection, and when I realized the book was about the very things I've been interested in, I ran (drove) to my nearest bookstore and grabbed a copy, eager to get it home and discover what new insights this fellow had to offer. Much to my disappointment, I found that he offered nothing new at all. In fact, I couldn't help but feel as I was trudging through page after page that I was reading the same basic message over and over again, and this \\"same basic message\\" was nothing more than what anyone who's taken a couple of introductory classes on Zen meditation would know.    Eventually, I decided to put the book down and try his earlier book, the one we're talking about here, \\"The Power of NOW\\", thinking perhaps that all of his real insights were contained in this one. Nope! It's the exact same introductory stuff all over again! Page after page of the exact same thing! Curious, I downloaded some of his video lectures and audio recordings. Guess what? Same thing again! Eckhart Tolle has nothing more than an introductory level knowledge of this material and he's apparently making a career out of repeating himself as many times and in as many ways as people are willing to pay for.     I don't mean to imply that he's just out to take your money. I do believe he's sincere, and his message, at its most basic level, rings true. The problem here is that if you spend five minutes with Eckhart Tolle, you'll know everything he does, but that won't stop him from repeating himself for hours if you let him. I would HIGHLY suggest that if you are truly interested in learning about this subject, the illusion of self and ways to manage, if not completely end, your suffering in life, there are much better teachers out there. Eckhart Tolle offers a potential starting point, nothing more.    An important point to consider, however, is that reading about enlightenment is a bit like reading how to ride a bike. This is something I'm not sure Eckhart Tolle himself understands. You can read every book ever written on how to ride a bike, and you could end up with an excellent theoretical knowledge of the experience. But that's all you would have. You can never truly know the experience of riding a bike until you are on the bike riding it! Can a theoretical understanding of enlightenment help improve your life? I have no doubt that it can. But you can not truly become something simply by reading about it. Eckhart Tolle repeats himself constantly with the idea that if you hear something enough times, you'll get it. That may be true of some things, but not this.
B001041JLE|3.0|Let me start by saying, I'm a huge MJ fan and, of course, Thriller is probably THE album that comes to mind for anyone who thinks Michael Jackson.  It's a classic!  ...However, the question one has to ask themselves when it comes to re-releases (especially after the recent 2001 re-release) is, what more am I getting?  Why am I going to spend another $20 on this project?    Obviously, the newly recorded bonus tracks/remixes are a MAJOR plus!  I mean, Michael's recording again!!!  And contrary to some negative reviews, if you're familiar with the \\"Jackson Sound\\", these tracks are definitely \\"jammin'\\"!    ...That, however, is where the perks stop.  Why he/Sony choose to release a \\"Casebook Edition\\" is beyond me.  For an extra $5-8 you get...  Pictures.  Pictures any MJ fan have already seen, if not own elsewhere.  To be frank, you may as well buy the \\"Standard/Classic Edition\\" for $9-11.  You still get all the bonus tracks plus the bonus DVD.    Do not be fooled into thinking you're getting this huge treat.  ...Even if it is Michael Jackson.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|I was so disappointed with 'Saw 2' that I almost skipped this film entirely.....I'm glad I didn't. In this third installment they go back to the roots of the first film and come up with an entertaining sequel. The version I watched on cable was not extremely gory to me but, it had enough blood and aftermaths to make most gorehounds happy. This is definitely worth a look.
0321525655|4.0|I will agree with everyone for what the book does it is great! Whets the appetite and gets the creative juices starting to flow.  I think my presentations like a lot of preachers don't exactly fit into this mold. I would love to see a premier on how he was able to do some of he effects. I would like to see when you presentation is involved more with an outline rather than \\"business charts\\". I have looked a bought a lot of books on presenting even the  Keynote books by others and haven't seen that niche covered.   Would love to have a CD with some of the presentations he speaks about on it where you could take a modify and use in your own work.   I guess I am still looking for a Preacher who uses Power Point, Keynote every Sunday to the same audience to write a book.  Still with all this said Garr has a Home Run here. He has come the closest to my ultimate book than anyone else.    Respectfully Yours,    Mike Hughes, D.Min., Th.D., Ph.D.
B000002VCU|5.0|\\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" was The Alan Parson Project's 5th album.  It came out in 1980, and remains one of my all-time favorite APP discs.  This concept album focuses on the attraction and despair associated with gambling.<br /><br />Overall, this album has the same general force and feel as \\"I Robot\\", thus departing from pop efforts on \\"Pyramid\\" and \\"Eve\\". This album, therefore, sees APP going back to its earlier harder driving progressive rock sounds of \\"Mystery and Imagination\\" and \\"I Robot.\\"  And, there is still something for just about everyone on this disc.<br /><br />As for the individual tracks...<br />- \\"May Be A Price to Pay\\" is reminiscent of \\"The Raven\\" in its general overall feel...good stuff!<br />- \\"Games People Play\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\\", and \\"Snake Eyes\\" have upbeat tempos and a solid progressive rock sound.  They have great techno-support and, at least to me, epitomize the definitive APP progressive rock sound.<br />- \\"Time\\" is one of APP's top all time hits.  It is a calmer, reflective piece, somewhat like \\"To One In Paradise\\" from \\"Tales of Mystery...\\", and is one of my all-time favorite mellow APP offerings.<br />- \\"Ace of Swords\\" and \\"The Gold Bug\\" are both strong tracks. I always looked forward to seeing what APP was going to do for an instrumental track or two on each of their albums.  These did not disappoint.<br />- \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" - This is the most mellow, and reflective track on the disc.  It suggests the hopelessness that gambling sometimes sdaly produces.<br />- Finally, the title track \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" is included in two parts, and they tie the album together.  It's a great sound.<br /><br />\\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" is, in my opinion, hands down, one of the absolute best APP albums ever produced.  If you are thinking about seeing what APP music is all about, this is one of the albums you should definitely investigate.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!!!!!<br /><br />-- a 30+ year APP listener
0307276902|3.0|Although much of this so-called true story has been discredited, A Million Little Pieces is still a decent read. Let me warn readers first by letting them know that the author uses absolutely no quotations marks which can be very annoying when you don't know which character is speaking. But moving beyond this, Frey does a decent job with character development and his writing is good too. The storyline becomes repetitive at times, but there are moments where you definitely feel the dark and lonely emotions that the author felt through his painful days of treatment. This book is probably a great read for anyone with a drug problem or a curiosity for the shadowed lives of addicts.
B000B5XOSO|1.0|Batman Returns. With a title like that, one would think that the movie would, I don't know, actually be about Batman. But no, unfortunately, Tim Burton seems more content to focus the movie around the villains. Its like he wanted to make \\"Penguin: The Movie,\\" and was forced to stick Batman in there somewhere. Not to mention the fact that they took a supposedly civilized and cultured villain like the Penguin and turn him into an vulgar retard living in the sewer. Is the penguin character threatening? Maybe. Too bad his master plan is to,um, kidnap babies? and send penguins to launch rockets into the city? What?!? And Catwoman has nothing to do with anything except randomly blowing up stuff, scratching people, promoting feminism, and giving Michael Keaton someone to kiss.      Halfway through the movie, I began to wonder, \\"Has Tim Burton ever heard of a plot?\\" I don't know, but there's not one in this film. Sure, the design of the film is great to look at, but that's all. And most films at least try to send a message or have an underlying theme. The only message I can get from this film is that if you fall out of a building, you'd better hope there's a bunch of cats there to revive you so you can run around putting aerosol cans in microwaves.   All in all, the Caped Crusader takes a back seat in this depressing, meaningless, plotless movie about a messed up version of the Penguin who uses his over-the-top flying umbrellas to reign terror upon, um, babies in their cradles.I may make people mad by saying this, but, as much as much as Joel Schumacher may have ruined the franchise with his neon lights and rubber nipples, I'd have to say that \\"Batman Forever\\" was way better than this. However, for those wanting to see Batman at his finest, watch \\"Batman Begins,\\" the only Batman movie done right (so far).   P.S. Where the heck did the Penguin get the blue prints for the Batmobile, any way?

B000WAGVHE|4.0|Main feature is 7.1 sound only. I have an older Yamaha receiver and it could not find the proper sound setting on DIGITAL AUTO:  It wanted to come up as DTS, but my home theater is only set up for DD 5.1. Ended up playing on a \\"cinema\\" setting which I think was DTS. The extras disc worked fine on 5.1<br /><br />THis is a wonderful movie with a great message.  It captures the look, feel, and color of the early 1960.s  Image is BRILLIANT on blu-ray.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the audio issue.  It does say it's only 7.1 on box but I missed that when I ordered it.  THis was the first 7.1 only disc I ever tried to play.

B000P2A24W|1.0|What a steaming heap of bad music this thing is. This band has consistently put out low-grade songs based on boring riffs, uninspired and often cliche-filled lyrics and bland vocals. John Bongiovi (the real name)is about as bad an actor as musician. Sambora is a real bore-a on guitar. He's no Mick Ronson, Joe Walsh, Mick Taylor or even Davey Johnstone. And as for the Springsteen comparisons, STOP! Both bands have Jersey connections, and both play rock. That's where they start and end. Springsteen's \\"pretentions\\" (as one reviewer called them) are another (more open-minded) man's idea of trying to be more than just three chords and a cloud of drums. The Beatles were not pretentious when making the music they did in '66-67. Neither was Springsteen in creating his music from '73-75. He's a romantic and a die-hard rock and roller. Nothing wrong with either or with infusing your music with it. He's also a story teller, so songs like Kitty's Back, Incident on 57th Street and Backstreets were inevitable. They're also pure adrenalin and beauty. Bongiovi? Boring, monotonous and bland. And the whole converting to \\"Country\\" (which actually died decades ago) is a really lame attempt to try and grab sales in a new market.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|Once tells an exceedingly simple story with enormous charm and heart and without a hint of guile. Glen Hansard is an Irish busker, still suffering from a broken heart over a previous girlfriend. Marketa Irglova does various jobs, cleaning house and working as a street vendor. She's also a hauntingly beautiful piano player and when the two of them begin playing music together their growing connection is a pleasure to watch. There are no melodramatic Hollywood style plot points to hang the story on, just a natural evolution of the relationship between these two likeable characters.<br /><br />Once reminded me so much of my experiences and friendships in Dublin in the 90's that it gave me nostalgia pains. I didn't know these two particular people in Dublin in the 90's but I feel like I did. I feel like one - or both of them - sat down with me in some pub, cheap restaurant or drafty flat and told me the story of them.
B000005H7D|5.0|When it comes to the basics of jazz, nothing comes close than JOhn Coltrane's masterpiece Blue Train.  Later Coltrane albums were more musically innovative, less structured, and more avant-garde, but when it comes to amazing jazz, period, Blue Train delivers the goods.  This is one awesome album, filled with soul, fire, and fun that no other post-bop jazz albums has been able to match.<br /><br />And one thing that amazes me is the variety of this album.  This is what hurts some of his other albums, such as Giant Steps.  On this, the solos are spread out to at least the sax, trumpets, and trombones, and there are some times where the drum gets his own solo, too (no bass solos, unfortunately).  It provides new sounds instead of having breathless nonstop saxaphone playing for the majority of the song.  The melodies that lead and conclude the song are bright, sharp, and gorgeous, like they should be.  There is a better sense of space in the solos too, which is what makes the album so great.  Blue Train is impossible not to love.<br /><br />Every song on here will have you snapping your fingers, tapping your toes, or just lying cool from the music, enjoying such a rich, brassy sound from the stereo speakers.  The classic title track is the perfect intro, with it's show-stopping misty intro, to it's amazing solos with terrific backup from the other instruments, like a harmony.  Moment's Notice and Locomotive swing harder than all of them, with extremely passionate, soulful playing and a sense of upbeat fun.  It's sublime in it's way it played.  I'm Old Fashioned is a sublime ballad, that perfectly captures the class of jazz and all that Frank Sinatra wishes he could do.  There's not a lyric in sight and it doesn't need them.  No lyrics leaves all the cheese away and all the mood.  The album is rounded out with Lazy Bird, a song that exits the album with a bit of a yearn, or an outro that resembles going into the sky or night with just the backdrop left.<br /><br />If you want to catch the Coltrane, no other album is as effective as Blue Train. If you idea of jazz is, rich brassy, shimmering, soulful melodies with a mean rhythm that will swing your soul into oblivion, than consider Blue Train a must listen.  If you appreciate the practice of cutting loose with glorious solos upon the unreplacable bass instruments, then consider Blue Train a must listen.  Basically, consider Blue Train a must listen.<br /><br />10/10ane, no other album is as effective as Blue Train. If you idea of jazz is, rich brassy, shimmering, soulful melodies with a mean rhythm that will swing your soul into oblivion, than consider Blue Train a must listen.  If you appreciate the practice of cutting loose with glorious solos upon the unreplacable bass instruments, then consider Blue Train a must listen.

6305127697|5.0|This is lengthy court room drama. However, it is never boring or confusing. In fact, its quite compelling throughout. And its all thanks to Edward Norton in probably his finest role. His portrayal as a suspected criminal in the slaying of a priest is oscar worthy. It demands attention.  Laura Linney is great in this too as a prosecuting attourney out to destroy Richard Gere's defense. As Norton's lawyer, Gere is in top form and actually watchable in this. Everyone plays their roles perfectly and the film concludes on an interesting note. Its a pretty ingenious ending. Everyone should watch this film.

0800141601|4.0|This is a hard movie to review. I actually did love this film as a film. That said, it is also not really related to the King Arthur legend. There is less mystery and fantasy here and more action and romance. I am not a fan of Richard Gere and this movie did not really improve my thinking of him. However, Sean Connery was brilliant in this as the King and Julia Ormond was also quite lovely. I wish she would act more nowadays. The film looks beautiful and it is romantic and somewhat adventurous. However, anyone looking for it to resemble the famous tales of Arthur and his famous knights and the mighty Merlin, this film isn't it.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This movie should be placed in the fiction or fantasy category because there is very little truth.  If you want to listen to a D student and non-scientist and proven liar lecture you then watch this movie.  If you want the true science on global warming read The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming by Christopher C. Horner a climatologist.<br /><br />This movie is a distortion of the facts and a total waste of time.  Unless you have drunk the kool-aid of course.
B00005S6K8|4.0|I have never seen the original but I love this version. Julia Ormond is fabulous as Sabrina, lonely daughter of a chauffer to a billionare family. Its a really enjoyable film and a great romance, if you are into that sort of thing. It doesn't get over the top and its a riot to see Harrison Ford's character interact with Sabrina. They really compliment each other well and make an interesting on-screen couple. This is one of those films that I can watch over and over.
0393061310|4.0|The idealists among us might wonder, if one civilization is so much more advanced than another, why couldn't that advanced civilization \\"live and let live?\\" Why did the Europeans have to basically embark on a policy of extermination of the indigenous people in America, why did they have to do the same thing in Australia, and so on. The author cites other instances, for instance, the Maori of Polynesia simply wiped out or enslaved another tribe, the Moriori, who must have been the \\"give-peace-a-chance\\" hippies of the 1830s. That sort of question appears to be out of scope for Diamond, and I feel he could have at least commented on it.<br /><br />...<br /><br />For my complete review of this book and for other book and movie<br />reviews, please visit my site [...]<br /><br />Brian Wright<br />Copyright 2008
B000089RVR|4.0|I've loved Dido's voice since I first heard her singing with Eminem on one of his songs. This is a fave album of mine. Its so calming and good.

I really can't get enough of her voice, its just so pure and soothing!

B000001EC1|5.0|Pretty much every hit of theirs is on this CD. Now, I have loved Bon Jovi since forever and you can't go wrong with their 80's stuff. Livin on a Prayer, Blaze of Glory You Give Love a Bad Name, etc...All wonderfully awesome pieces of music. However, I simply and utterly love 'Always'. I think it was written for this CD and I must say that it is on par with their classic older songs. Its an amazing and powerful single. And probably my favorite Bon Jovi song in general. That, and their very first hit single, 'Runaway', which also happens to be on this CD. It can't get any better than this.
B0013ANMWY|3.0|Okay, so yeah, it's corny and cliche. To some extent though it does makes some valid points. I like the idea of without war and aggression and emotion humans cease to be human. Its a theme that's, no doubt, been used before but nevertheless is still interesting. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't spend enough time developing that theme. There's a good bit of running, and then some screaming, and then some crying, and then more running, and then some more crying, and then more running. Until the end when the point is of it all is finally discovered. I wasn't bored but I don't think its worth 4 bucks. I rented it when it was 2.50.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|For everyone who was forced to read Beowulf in school at one point or another knows that this film is not really whatsoever like the old tale. I have read the story once, in 7th grade, and now, at 24, I was forced into rememberance after watching this film. What I did recall was that it was not like at all what they portrayed in the film. Things were changed. Big important things. Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother may have been eye candy to some people, but from what I remember was that she was in actuallity pretty vile looking. And the fake high heel thing was eye poppingly ridiculous. It was just all very bizaar. The actual voice work was pretty good. And the CGI was incredible. It was hard at times to realise that what we were watching was completely computerized. It really was an amazing feat. The Dragon action scene was pretty cool too. It certainly had its moments and was enjoyable at times, but overall, a real downer.

0060890096|5.0|Jay O. Sanders performance of this mind-boggling work is equally mind-blowing. He understands the book thoroughly and seems to channel the characters effortlessly. There's an honesty and shocked intensity that parallels the book's--all rendered with extreme confidence and cool. I love it and recommend it highly. One of the best reads ever.
037582913X|5.0|A few weeks ago, I had a realization that this book really is amazing.  It reminded me that even though there are parts of me that seem scary, the monster in the closet (or at the end of the book as it were) is really lovable.
0143038419|1.0|There are so many reviews and so much buzz here and elsewhere about this book. If you are considering whether to read this book or not, all I can say is that if you have lived a considered life, have travelled, maybe lived in another country or culture for awhile, read widely, and questioned yourself and/or your motives occasionally, you will probably not enjoy this book.     In my view, Eat, Pray, Love appeals to the kind of woman who wishes she had time, freedom, and/or income to do the things Elizabeth Gilbert writes about. Reading the book is a way for ordinary women to live vicariously through someone else's travels and search for self. If you have already done any of this kind of inner work for yourself, in your own country or elsewhere, you will likely come away disappointed with the lack of depth in the book.    If, however, you are looking for inspiration or courage to begin your own spiritual or physical travels, you might find this book worthwhile.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Great way to catch up on \\"Lost\\" episodes and story line.  The extras are interesting and answers some of those questions swimming in your head.
0143038419|5.0|What I found most endearing about \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" was Elizabeth Gilbert's humor.  She has a delightful way of writing and comes across as very real, very normal.  Normal, even though her adventures seemed anything but.  You can actually see her coming into her own on each page, drawing strength from each previous day.  The reader of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" goes along on the journey as well and may end up with their own revelations.  Although the \\"Pray\\" and \\"Love\\" chapters seem harmless enough, I do strongly caution  you on the \\"Eat\\" chapters! LOL, I found myself hungry and looking for pizza on more than one occasion!<br />Elizabeth Gilbert has opened her spiritual adventure for all to read and shared some of the most intimate moments of her life.  If you get nothing else from this book but the chance to laugh a little, it's well worth the read.
1594489505|5.0|This beautifully crafted novel is a must read and is worthy of Oprah's Book Club List.  Educational as it may be known for, it is also a very entertaining story.  Set in Afghanistan, Hosseini reminds us in the US and other places in the world how fortunate we are.  Filled with love and deception and war, it teaches us what Afghanis' lifes are like.  I would recommend this book to any book reader!

0143113100|5.0|I am an Occupational Therapist who works with a myriad of populations (TBI, Spinal Cord injury, multi trauma, CVA, ortho, etc) and cannot begin to say how much this book has expanded upon my current knowledge. It is not often a clinician can find a book with so much applicable knowledge to practice! While much of what is included are things that were touched upon in my graduate studies as well as in continuing education, this book is organized to put it all together in an eloquent format. It goes deeper than most-- and offers up case studies to allow for a holistic view of theories and facts proposed.    The wonders of neuroplasticity and its implications in human kind are fascinating to begin with. Even those who are not in the medical profession can enjoy this. For those that are in the medical profession-- it will help to dispel the myth of \\"localization theory\\" so commonly thought to be the one and only rule.     A fantastic read to be sure.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|It's not often that I review movies (there are some exceptions) but felt compelled to do so here as there seem to be so many that disliked Elizabeth - The Golden Age. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters and was thoroughly impressed. Yes, the costumes were spectacular, the photography superlative, and the scenery breathtaking; in other words, this film is filled with eye candy. Cate Blanchett played the awesomely beautiful queen and I was transfixed by her performance - something that normally doesn't happen to me when I go to a movie.    Granted, there may be many historical inaccuracies in this film but I didn't buy a ticket to receive an education - I use other sources (such a books) to accomplish that. (What a concept!) Elizabeth - The Golden Age, effectively transported me out of the here and now into another realm which only the arts can do. It also led to a desire to read more on the life of the \\"Virgin Queen.\\" It is for those reasons that I would highly recommend this film.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Imaginar que vi esta série na década de 70 narrada pelo Walmor Chagas... É... o tempo voa.  Mas este documentário não perdeu em nada a sua essência, mesmo se tendo passado mais de 30 anos desde a sua produção.    Mais do que relatar a guerra, o seu conteúdo está em mostrar os horrores perpetuados por este conflito sangrento e que é um dos (se não o mais) mais marcantes do século XX.  Ao longo de 27 capítulos (e ainda contando com um bom número de documentários extras), o texto muito bem escrito mostra visões profundas sobre os acontecimentos durante o conflito.      Tratando desde as operações militares até as questões políticas internas dos Estados Unidos, Inglaterra e Alemanha, a série dá uma boa idéia do que aconteceu durante este período, mas sem entrar em mais detalhes por óbvias questões de tempo.    A narração de Sir Laurence Olivier é um caso à parte.  No melhor estilo britânico, o uso de interpretações, pausas e frases de efeito tem, devido à sua experiência como ator, um realce ao qual não se deve desprezar.      Infelizmente esta versão vem (no meu caso) sem legendas.  Então, é necessário um conhecimento um pouco profundo na língua inglesa pelo lado britânico para poder se obter o máximo do que é proporcionado.    É claro que este documentário está mais baseado no lado vencedor da guerra (ou mais precisamente, no lado britânico) o que não poderia deixar de acontecer.  Mas, apesar de sua idade, The World at War continua a ser um clássico.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|There are lots of comments about the movie itself and I found it to be fun, more of \\"Ocean's 11\\" and less of \\"12\\" (a very good thing).  My issue is with the very poor visual quality.  From the beginning and throughout the movie, the on-screen presentation is very grainy, looking like a second- or third-generation copy of a videotape.  I have the widescreen DVD, not HD, version.  I bought this just to see the movie, not to look for a home theater demonstration disc, so my expectations were not too high.  \\"Ocean's 13\\" quality however failed to deliver to the low bar I set for it.  I watched this on a Sony 70\\" Qualia 006 rear-projection HDTV, a device that is pretty unforgiving of bad source material.  Suggest rather than spending the money to own this DVD that instead spend a lot less and download the film to TiVo or put it in your NetFlix rotation.
0553278398|1.0|I wanted a good Sci-Fi book or fantasy book. I remember the Xanth series, John Carter of Mars books, but this was rediculously dull. If I hate a book half way I'll stop reading it, which I did. It seemed like a story about a scientist running away from agents of a leader who were trying to kill him. He wanders around on a top of a dome for several pages and I told myself, that's it. I'm done. I'm sure Asimov has done well for himself with the other books, but this one seemed like he was just trying to stretch out a story way too long.
B000006OAM|4.0|Let me state upfront that I am a big Natalie Merchant fan. I have all the albums, of course. That said, it was quite a surprise to me when I was at a dinner party recently and in the background \\"Ophelia\\" was playing. Natalie has been out of the limelight quite a while now (the last studio album, the vastly underappreciated \\"The House Carpenter's Daughter\\" was issued in 2003), and I will admit I hadn't put Natalie in my CD changer since forever. I relistened to all of her albums, but \\"Ophelia\\" sticks out, and now that we are approaching the 10th anniversary of its release (originally released in May, 1998), it's worth revisiting it.<br /><br />On \\"Ophelia\\" (11 tracks, 57 min.) it is immediately clear that this will not be \\"Tigerlily 2\\". Indeed the somber title track kicks things off, and sets the mood for the entire album: pensive, introspective, and slower. \\"Kind & Generous\\", the sole radio hit on here, in fact sounds a bit out of place and I can imagine that anyone hearing this song and buying this album, expecting something along the lines of the easily accessible \\"Tigelily\\", would have been mightily disappointed (and perhaps even felt mislead). The heart of the album are tracks 5 and 6: \\"My Skin\\" is as haunting and vulnerable as Natalie has ever sounded, to this day still, with lines like \\"Do you remember the way that you touched me before/all the trembling sweetness/I loved and adored.../Your face saving promises/whispered like prayers/I don't need them\\", wow. \\"Break Your Heart\\" is a slightly faster song in which Natalie reflects on the emotional hurt that people suffer. Other highlights include \\"Thick as Thieves\\" which includes a subdued but chilling electric guitar solo, and the short pensive \\"Effigy\\". What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the very last track \\"When They Ring the Golden Bells\\", which belongs on the \\"Carpenter's Daughter\\" album, not here, but it's a slight complaint, to be sure.<br /><br />In all, to rediscover \\"Ophelia\\" is like running into an old friend you haven't seen in a long time and immediately reconnect with. Frankly, I'm surprised how well this album has aged, hard to believe that this came out 10 years ago! Rumor has it that Natalie finally will issue a new album sometime later in 2008. Come back already Natalie, we miss you!ou haven't seen in a long time and immediately reconnect with.

B0012BTBQU|5.0|I along with countless others was devastated when I learned the news that Robert Jordan had passed.  I was sorry for him, for his wife and family, for his countless fans and yes even sorry for myself.  Death in and of itself is a tradgedy but how sad not to be able to finish the crowning achievment of your life.  Jordan himself called the WOT \\"The book that ate his life.\\"  And that was before he was ever sick.  If TOR and Jordans wife had chosen to let the series go unfinished I would have respected that.  I did find myself nervous about them trying to choose someone to fill Jordans legendary gigantic literary shoes.  I consider myself farely well read in the fantasy genre and when the announcement was made about the new author I was a little shocked. I had not even heard of him.  Who is this Sanderson guy.  Well I like countless others made it my business to find out.  So I read Mistborn the very book that Jordan's wife stated was the reason for choosing him.  All I have to say is \\"Well done.\\"  I have a new favorite author and he is deserving of what ever accolades come his way.    Read Misborn and his other novels and then just wait for the final WOT.    I have an idea we will not be disapointed.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Constantine is great fun, very light - don't take it seriously or you'll regret it. I love the main characters - Gabriel, Constantine, the Fixer with the fetish for bugs. The lead woman was a bit flat, and constantine wasn't as colourful as in the comic... partly due to Keanu's limited acting range (ie \\"woah!\\") but also because he was adapted for US audiences.<br /><br />There are even serious plot issues... why exactly is the fabulous christian artefact... owned by the Nazis... to be found in Mexico?<br /><br />But even despite its deficiencies, it's still a lot of fun - packed with great action, powerful scenes and a wonderful moody feel. Even the cheesy shots seem to work - eg Satan gloating over Constantine's imminent death, then receiving a finger for his trouble. and what a fantastic choice of casting that was ;)<br /><br />Watch it, but don't think too deeply about it - it's for fun, not study.
0553573411|5.0|I find it puzzling that as I read other reviewers complaints and lists of negatives about this book I have to agree. Yet somehow, I never noticed until I had rabidly devoured all three books.  Specific to Royal Assassin, if it's frustrating that Regal is never reigned in, the explanation is plausible.  I didn't find this book slow, though in retrospect, I have to agree that not much happened other than the growth of Fitz through the experiences he had.  True, waaaayyyy too many bad things seem to happen to him with little to offset it, but that's part of why the series is so gut wrenching and enthralling.<br /><br />As wicked of me as it may be, my biggest complaint about the book, indeed, the whole series, is that Fitz does precious little assassinating.  Practically none.  Odd in books about an assassin.<br /><br />The ending of this book is not for the faint of heart.  I was shaken to say the least and began to doubt that reading the third book would be of any benefit.  In short, it was dealt with well in Assassin's Quest but that made it no less disturbing at the time.<br /><br />A fantastic book, if not because it's perfect and has no flaws, but because the story is too compelling for you to notice the imperfections.
B000002HD5|4.0|Two-thirds of a masterpiece spotted with filler and failures; such is the most apt description of the Whigs' best record, exposing some of Greg Dulli's finest songwriting and some of his least effective. The last two tracks are pretty shrugworthy and \\"My Curse\\" is dull and resigned, but pretty much everything else is great.     Morose lead-off track, \\"If I Were Going,\\" promises more than the album delivers, but it sets the tone straight for things to come: this is not the same band we heard on \\"Big Top Halloween.\\" Maturity and songcraft reign on \\"Fountain and Fairfax\\" and \\"Now You Know,\\" but the first half is so strong start to finish that I'm left wishing it had been an EP. The self-titled track and \\"Debonair\\" are both striking rockers with enough grooves to prove Dulli is far more than his garage punk roots would suggest and the low key \\"When We Two Parted\\" is the Whigs' best slower number to date. Despite its hiccups, this is a must-have for fans and probably the best place to start in on the band. It falls just short of being a terrific record.    Best cuts: \\"Gentlemen,\\" \\"When We Two Parted,\\" \\"What Jail Is Like,\\" \\"Debonair,\\" \\"If I Were Going,\\" \\"Mountain and Fairfax,\\" \\"Be Sweet,\\" \\"Now You Know\\"

B0000029DD|4.0|Son of mildly unknown 60s cult folk pioneer Tim Buckley, Jeff was a mildly unknown 90s cult mood-and-soul rocker that enjoyed a brief moment in the underground spotlight with \\"Grace.\\" While it is equally hailed and forgotten (depending on the circle), it's neither as revolutionary nor as shrugworthy as either would attest.     There are some great moments on here (notably the title track, the slow-build lead-off \\"Mojo Pin,\\" the driving \\"So Real,\\" the epic \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over,\\" and his minor alternative hit, \\"Last Goodbye,\\") but also at least one or two tepid ones (the spare but slow \\"Lilac Wine,\\" the breathy and overwrought \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\"). Credit Buckley for changing things up with the unexpectedly hard-rocking \\"Eternal Life\\" late in the album; it was a risk to break up the consistent sound, but it also helps make the sometimes sluggish second half pick up mightily when it comes on.    Best cuts: \\"Grace,\\" \\"So Real,\\" \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over,\\" \\"Eternal Life,\\" \\"Last Goodbye,\\" \\"Mojo Pin,\\" \\"Hallelujah,\\" \\"Dream Brother\\"
B001041JLE|2.0|I didn't see it back in 1982, and I STILL don't see it...it's just an average, overproduced pile of junk.  Yes, it had 7 hits...big whoop.  Yes, he did the MOONwalk...big whoop.<br /><br />I just never saw the appeal...and he still comes across as a man craving some sort of credibility...a whiff of desperation resounds throughout \\"Thriller\\"...and I am STILL not impressed.<br /><br />Historic???

Eddie Van Halen does the guitar solo on \\"Beat It\\"...I hate Van Halen with a passion...worst band in the world ever.<br /><br />Honestly???

B000002NC4|4.0|Their third album is the first one on a major label and so they do what any indie-gone-pro would do...make a fifty-five minute album with eight tracks? Did they not read the handbook for getting big with short and catchy pop songs? In fact, Built to Spill teeters into prog-rock territory, a dangerous place to be even for those that did it well (hell, even King Crimson released some really bad music).     For more proof beyond the song length, look at the bluster of some of these songs, particularly on the lyrical side, where frontman Doug Martsch goes for the occasional bombastic-supersonic vision. But...it still IS Built to Spill, and even though only a couple of songs check in under six minutes, even their messes can be glorious. And not all of Martsch's songwriting has a flair for the over-dramatic--sometimes the music and lyrics are appropriately stark and dour (quite the contrast from the usually upbeat work on \\"There's Nothing Wrong With Love\\"). I prefer their earlier album, of course, but on the well-paced and rhythmic \\"I Would Hurt a Fly\\" to the constantly driving \\"Untrustable Part 2,\\" and even the tempered drone of \\"Randy Described Eternity,\\" Martsch and company remind us that even excess can sometimes be a thing of beauty.    Best cuts: \\"I Would Hurt a Fly,\\" \\"Untrustable Part 2 (About Someone Else),\\" \\"Made Up Dreams,\\" \\"Randy Described Eternity,\\" \\"Stop the Show,\\" \\"Velvet Waltz\\"

B000069AUI|3.0|Strangely ineffectual take on the soulful pop rock sound on the British band's sophomore album. Chris Martin has the pretty falsetto to wail his heart out, but for the most part, the music lacks weight and edge, his performance gives bombast a new meaning, and the risks taken are few and far between. Those looking for safe, comfortable music with an emotional pull will probably love this but those looking for a little more will feel left in the cold (forgive the pun).     \\"Clocks\\" has guilty pleasure written all over it, but ends up succeeding thanks to the drive of the melody; \\"Politik\\" is moody and does the quiet/loud thing quite well; and \\"The Scientist\\" has a very strong sense of sweeping melancholy. But over eleven tracks, the spirit is drained and Martin's appeals strain very thin. Certainly listenable, and those few songs are definitely worth a spin or two, but little more.    Best cuts: \\"The Scientist,\\" \\"Politik,\\" \\"Clocks,\\" \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" \\"Amsterdam,\\" \\"Green Eyes\\"

B0007ZEO4G|4.0|Ian Gillan was gone, replaced by David Coverdale, but the change was less Sammy Hagar and more Brian Johnson, so they rocked on with little trouble (plus, new bassist Glenn Hughes sang lead vocals on a few tracks too). Highlighted by the smashing opener, Deep Purple's eighth album was like most of the rest of their Mark II material--some great hard rock songs interspersed with the expected filler.     As a result, after getting \\"Machine Head,\\" most newbies to Deep Purple would be best served with a greatest hits package. Of course, on a best of compilation, you won't hear the likes of \\"You Fool No One\\" and \\"What's Going On Here?\\" The arrangements are far more complex this time around, and the effort (including instrumentation) more adventurous. In fact, the only song that demands a miss is the insipid instrumental finale. They ruin a perfect slow-burn blues ending on \\"Mistreated\\" by tacking on that? Knock that one off and you can raise the score (a lot of fans give this a 5 anyway).    Best cuts: \\"Burn,\\" \\"What's Going On Here?\\" \\"Mistreated,\\" \\"You Fool No One,\\" \\"Might Just Take Your Life,\\" \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\"
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|This is the kinda pic that will get you calling your chums and telling them how much they need to haul their derriere cinema-side. It's a tightly collected bunch of reflections on life's better emotions and yearnings. The need to create. The need to bring good things to people that you care about. The desire to sing about life's good & bad things with an aim to release the tightly wound happy/sad spring that lurks in all of us. The wish to acclaim friends & strangers when they provide us with a means to see the beauty that is ebbing and flowing all around us...........................I have never watched a movie on three consecutive days in my life, until now.
B0000931OG|4.0|Apparent swan song for Blur (Graham Coxon left the band mid-way through its recording) is no less eclectic and bizarre than any of their other efforts, if not even more so. Songs like \\"Ambulance,\\" \\"Crazy Beat,\\" and \\"Gene By Gene\\" employ unnatural sounds against each other in often jagged arrangements. In the latter, the noise can be so caustic through the cross rhythms that it becomes borderline-annoying.     Much of the rest is dreamy pop songs floating by at a sleepy pace; some are strong (\\"Jets,\\" \\"Sweet Song\\") while others are rather dull (\\"Caravan\\"). The breaks between are where the best bits come from, such as the catchy rhythms in \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" and the short-form, punkish throwaway \\"We've Got a File on You.\\" Mildly disappointing considering how good previous albums were, but it's strong enough to warrant a listen from fans and non-fans alike.    Best cuts: \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" \\"We've Got a File on You,\\" \\"Jets,\\" \\"Sweet Song,\\" \\"Ambulance,\\" \\"Crazy Beat,\\" \\"Good Song,\\" \\"Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club\\"

B00000JBFW|3.0|Since they were all still alive (really...no overdoses?), there seemed to be no reason why the Deep Purple Mark II line-up couldn't reunite in the 80s and cash in on the gaping hole in heavy metal. After all, the heavy metal favor was swinging fast from the likes of Judas Priest and Motorhead to (shudder) groups like Quiet Riot and Whitesnake (David Coverdale might have been jealous of his former paycheck's renewed success if he wasn't too busy sleeping with Tawny Kitaen).     As reunion albums go, it's actually pretty good, but compared to the best of their old Mark II material, it's mostly marginal. True, the title track remains one of their better songs thanks in large part to John Lord's organ, but there aren't a lot of essential songs beyond that. \\"Nobody's Home\\" and \\"A Gypsy's Kiss\\" can compete with most of Purple's non-hit material during their 70s heyday, but this was always a band best-known for their ever-rotating radio hits. Worth a listen for fans; everyone else can skip it unless they can find it for cheap.    Best cuts: \\"Perfect Strangers,\\" \\"Nobody's Home,\\" \\"Knockin' At Your Back Door,\\" \\"A Gypsy's Kiss,\\" \\"Mean Streak\\"

156224003X|5.0|What I like most about the book is that Kenny Werner believes, as I do, that all humans have master musicians within us. If you are willing to keep an open mind and explore beyond music itself to gain mastery over your musical performance, his book and accompanying CD Effortless Mastery has a lot to offer. Not only will you gain true mastery over your musical performance, but you'll enjoy both preparation and performance infinitely more.     One the other hand if you don't like books that delve into spiritual development or the idea of our interconnectedness so prevalent in personal growth, then this book and the CD meditations may not be for you.    Readers already familiar with meditation, Zen, or other Eastern philosophies will immediately recognize many of the fundamental ideas and perhaps have an advantage in following Werner's advice as to how to apply it. However, the book is written in such a way that it is accessible to people with no prior background in these disciplines as long as you are willing to keep an open mind.    Werner's description of fear-based music making captures much of what I experienced and saw/heard around me throughout my musical training before and during university. It's a problem I worked hard to help my own students overcome, even in my earliest days as a teacher, and it's refreshing to know that there are other people out there showing musicians the way out of this fear-based realm.    The accompanying CD meditations are helpful as well, especially if you have limited meditation experience. The author's voice is smooth and velvety and helps induce the listener more easily reach the desired state of centeredness. The only thing I would change about the meditations is that I would prefer a gentle transition back out of the meditative state. If you've gone into a very deep state, the transition is too abrupt and not ideal in my opinion. Perhaps it is done intentionally so to let the performer reach out for her instrument and practice/perform while in that state, but I think it is less than ideal and the wise reader will add her own slow transition out of the meditative state.    All in all, Kenny Werner's book and CD set is an empowering work that can help to free the joy and musicianship of musicians at all levels and genres. I highly recommend it.
B0000073I5|4.0|This is a fine album of progressive pop rock from Mike Rutherford that was released while Genesis was on a brief hiatus - at the time, Phil Collins was sorting out his personal problems.  Along with Steve Hackett's debut Voyage of the Acolyte (1975), Smallcreep's Day (1980) does an excellent job of meeting listener's expectations when the Genesis \\"sound\\" is mentioned.  Specifically, the album sounds a lot like some of the material off of Wind and Wuthering (1976), ...And then there were Three (1978), and especially Duke (1980).  The fact that David Hentschel produced the album did not hurt one bit at all, and this is one of my favorite Genesis-related solo albums (along with Voyage of the Acolyte).<br /><br />The lineup includes Mike Rutherford (bass guitar, electric and acoustic guitars, Taurus bass pedals and/or bass synthesizer); Noel McCalla (lead vocals), the fantastic Simon Phillips on drums, Brand X member Morris Pert (percussion) and long-time Charterhouse friend Anthony \\"Ant\\" Phillips (polymoog synthesizer, piano, organ).  There is some fantastic playing on this album and Ant's atmospheric keyboard work really adds a lot to the overall sound.  Although he does not resort as frequently to the intricate right hand arpeggios that Tony Banks used, he holds his own.  Simon Phillips is a heavy drummer (like Terry Bozzio) and simply burns on this album, particularly during the vigorous instrumental passages.  Mike uses a lot of tone colors that folks might associate with the late 1970's Genesis sound including bass pedals and in a few instances, acoustic guitars - Mike's electric guitar work is not bad at all.  The vocals by Noel McCalla are OK and although a bit \\"corporate sounding\\" at times, are not nearly as bland and colorless as the vocalist used on Tony Bank's solo album A Curious Feeling (1979).<br /><br />At 51:14 this is a long album, much of which is occupied by the massive 24:38 multi-movement Smallcreeps Day suite.  Based on what I have read, the concept underlying Smallcreep's Day is an adaptation of the surrealist novel Smallcreep's Day, written by Peter Currell Brown (although the ending of Mike's adaptation is happier).  The remaining tracks fall within the 4 to 7 minute range and present a nice mix of prog and pop.  Remarkably, this album sounds very \\"Genesis-y\\", with loads of gloomy, Tony Banks-like chords on the keyboards and great dynamic contrasts that range from atmospheric and misty synthesizer pads to full blown instrumental rave-ups.  As it turns out, Mike is an excellent arranger and the lengthy suite works extremely well - indeed, the whole album sounds very much like a group effort and not just the ideas of one person (I think Ant was instrumental in this regard).  While the shorter tracks are not as proggy, they are still very well written and occasionally feature some great ensemble work.<br /><br />This particular reissue of the album is not so great and does not feature any information at all apart from the track listing.  The sound quality is OK but could benefit from some tweaking.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine solo album and is recommended along with similar-sounding Genesis albums including: Wind and Wuthering, ...And Then There Were Three and Duke.allcreep's Day is an adaptation of the surrealist novel Smallcreep's Day, written by Peter Currell Brown (although the ending of Mike's adaptation is happier).

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was introduced to this game a few years ago at a family gathering and now every time we get together this is the game everyone wants to play.  We received the 4th edition for Christmas and it has quickly become a hit with my new family.  My husband and his sons are now addicts to this game.  The only thing I wasn't too fond of is the interlocking border.  It doesn't seem to fit well together and as a result we have a hard time getting the pieces to lay flat, though it doesn't seem to interrupt play too much.  It might be just a matter of breaking it in.  Regardless, we love to play it and I can't forsee ever getting tired of it.  I highly recommend it.

The recent 5 time Grammy winning artist performs an awkward but quite amazing live performance on her \\"I Told You I Was Trouble\\" live DVD.  She does drink a little during the performance but it doesn't affect her performance that much.  The band and background singers are amazing alongside Amy.  She performs hits like Love is a losing game, Back to Black, and the Grammy winning Rehab.  Don't let the on stage drinking distract you from this great performance by such a great artist like Amy.

B0010ZR160|5.0|After the very public dissolution of his relationship with Jennifer Lopez and the critical and commercial flop of their film [[ASIN:B0000DKDUT Gigli]], Ben Affleck wisely adopted a low profile, taking on modest character roles in films like [[ASIN:B000KWZ7JC Hollywoodland (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000O77SF4 Smokin' Aces (Widescreen Edition)]] and decided to go behind the camera, directing his first feature film, Gone Baby Gone. Affleck plays to his strengths by making it in his hometown of Boston and casting his little brother Casey in the lead role.<br /><br />Along with [[ASIN:B0010DR4BO The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]], Casey Affleck finally moves into the spotlight with these two high profile film roles. He demonstrates what a good investigator Patrick is by the way he interacts with people, gaining their confidence and trust with an unassuming, easy-going nature. Affleck brings a perceptive intelligence to the role. Patrick is a cool customer who knows how to talk his way out of tense situations. Affleck also has a quiet intensity and an affable charm which is always interesting to watch.<br /><br />Ben Affleck keeps things close to home for his first directorial effort. He is also smart with his direction. Affleck doesn't try to get too fancy with camera angles or movements and remembers that the story is the most important thing. The fact that he respects the story makes him a good storyteller. Affleck draws us in with an intriguing premise and then lets the story do its thing.<br /><br />Affleck has done an excellent job and has gotten really good performances out of the entire cast. If he ever decides to give up acting, he'll have a promising career as a director. Like [[ASIN:B0001ZX0PG Mystic River (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)]], Gone Baby Gone wrestles with a complicated moral dilemma and leaves it up to us to decide if the right decision was made by the protagonist.<br /><br />\\"Going Home: Behind the Scenes with Ben Affleck\\" takes a look at Affleck's approach to making the film. Dennis Lehane and co-screenwriter Aaron Stockard talk briefly about adapting the book. The film's themes are mentioned and what they mean to those involved.<br /><br />Also included are six deleted with optional commentary by director and co-screenwriter Ben Affleck and screenwriter Aaron Stockard. There is a longer version of the opening credits sequence that shows Patrick and Angie at work and establishes their skill as investigators. There is a little more about Angie's past and we also see the intimacy of their relationship. Affleck talks about why this footage was cut.<br /><br />\\"Capturing Authenticity: Casting Gone Baby Gone.\\" Affleck shot in real communities and cast the people who lived there as extras. He talks about casting his brother in the film and what he brought to the role. Other key cast members talk about what drew them to the film.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by Affleck and Stockard. Affleck points out that the opening credits sequence, with its shots of actual people who lived in the neighbourhood, sets the tone for the rest of the film. He wanted a realistic look with no stylish filters, camerawork, etc. There are several lulls in the commentary but when Affleck does speak (and he tends to dominate), he imparts plenty of information and filming anecdotes.eck's approach to making the film.

1594489505|5.0|[[ASIN:1413779646 Maggie Rose and Sass]]      A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful, heartbreaking, and yet life affirming story.  Ordinarily I would not have read about Afghanistan, having no interest in that part of the world and somehow seeing those people as \\"different,\\" but I joined a book club and our reading selection was The Kite Runner by the same author.  It was such a good story that I knew I had to read A Thousand Splendid Suns.  In my estimation, it is even better than The Kite Runner, but maybe just because I'm a woman and A Thousand Splendid Suns tells its story through two, wonderfully courageous women.  In reading the story, I soon lost sight of the \\"differences\\" between me, a western woman in a privileged society, and those two women in Afghanistan who had to fight tooth and nail to survive both physically and emotionally, and they became the same as me or any of my sisters.  Male domination plus the cruel, mad rages of war in a land where life appears to have little worth, makes all of their lives, but especially women's, so very hard.  In this story, one is again made conscious of the fact that people no matter where they live or what they believe have the same needs.  We humans all need to be loved, to be safe, to be happy, and to be free.  The two heroines of A Thousand Splendid Suns will capture your heart and you will not be able to put the book down for anything but the necessities of life, until you know what happens to Mariam and Laila.

After ending book three with an awesome epilouge, I could not wait for Book four...and I couldn't have been more disappointed. Nothing happened. Not only did nothing major happen, but some characters we were all wondering about weren't even addressed with their own chapters.

0446577391|4.0|This is the third of David Baldacci's books to feature the Camel Club.  The books are best read in order because each book builds on earlier events and further develops characters already introduced.<br /><br />This time around, the Camel Club (Oliver Stone, Milton Farb, Reuben Rhodes and Caleb Shaw) are fighting on two fronts. Casino king Jerry Bagger is hunting Annabelle Conroy, an honorary member of the Club, who conned him out of millions. At the same time, Stone himself is under direct threat. Ghosts from Stone's mysterious past seem to be surfacing, and some significant people are being murdered.  We know early on who is doing the murdering, but understanding why (and who will be next) adds a whole dimension to the story.<br /><br />There's plenty of action in this novel with some interesting twists and turns. I think this is the best of Mr Baldacci's novels I have read so far, and I'll certainly be looking forward to the next.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000059XUO|4.0|\\"The Crow\\" debuted in theatres amid a myriad of stories about Brandon Lee's death.  The ghost of Lee hovering over the film overshadowed the film itself.  The film is a classic vengence tale.  It differs from the norm in that it deals with the supernatural.  But rather than paint the Crow as a cold blooded hero delivering vigelante justice, we are given a character crushed and saddened by the harsh  memories of his and his fiance's death.  This sadness drives him to deliver justice to his killers.    \\"The Crow\\" is a great adaptation of the comic. And while I understand all the purists out there, I think the film is even better.  Brandon Lee breathes a certain humanity into the character that helps us root for him more.  The Sarah character helps elevate The Crow beyond being out there for purely vengence, as he still has a bond with her.  Alex Proyas and co have created in some senses, a deeper story than the book.  Though, admittedly, the emotion is elevated by Brandon Lee's sad demise during production.    As to the production itself, I don't think any other director could pull this film off.  This and Proyas' subsequent \\"Dark City\\" are visual marvels in how they create a setting that becomes a character itself.  I think there are only two scenes that show light in this movie.  So to call this movie dark is an understatement.  But it's how it's the mood that it creates and how it's so artfully done that makes the film look so terrific.  As the Crow flies over the city, we are given a look of ruin and chaos.  Proyas makes an effort to make this film look \\"dirty,\\" down to the very characters.    In addition, this film boasts a tremendous soundtrack.  It's not just the alt-rock hits either.  Graeme Revelle delivers a haunting score that adds to the ambience of the film. The best example of how it adds to the tone is when Erik goes to find Skank and during the shootout, the sound becomes muffled with the exception of the score.    To be sure, Alex Proyas' \\"The Crow\\" is different than J.O. Barr's.  He is featured on this disc - and let me tell you, I would never guess that he was the creator of the Crow.  Additional features on the disc include a commentary, which is insightful, but none of the major players are present.  It's a producer and screenwriter.  Interestingly, but probably not surprisingly, little of what happened actually on set is mentioned.  Rather, it talks a lot about how the film came to fruition. It's informative, if nothing else.

B000Z0OX9O|3.0|Ok....this is one of those products that must be recomended only for fans of Vangelis (wich i am) or colectors of Blade Runner material....the thing is that i can not say is a definitive edition of Blade Runner soundtrack...because is not, i love the movie also and i would like to have the original soundtrack that we listen during the movie and not more music \\"based\\" on the film or new creations for the movie.....on the other side i love Vangelis music so im happy to get some new material from one of the best composers ever.    As i said i think this excelent product is only for real fans of Vangelis and Blade Runner.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|Nice to have on Blu-Ray, but since it is an animated film, hard to see a big difference over the standard DVD release.
B000UD0ESA|3.0|The re-mastering was fine but I had forgotten just how boring the parts between the \\"spurts\\" of action were!
B000002O96|4.0|Having just purchased and listened to this album all the way through, I'd like to point out three things not mentioned in any of the previous reviews...    1) Chuck Berry does not sing on this album. I don't know why the description includes him, but he wouldn't have fit in with this group at all. However,    2) Beyond \\"the big three\\" vocalists featured on the album cover, the liner notes also inform us that the backing band included Buddy Guy on bass, Hubert Sumlin on rhythm guitar, and Otis Spann on piano-- three bona fide musical legends in their own right. Folks, that's $1 for every blues legend on this disc! That's what I call a bargain!    3) Although many of the songs here were sung on other recordings by these musicians, this is, in effect, a cover album. None of the songs were actually composed by any of the performers mentioned above. This is quite interesting, since one might presume that a meeting of major blues egos of the kind assembled here would have resulted in some serious jockeying over whose tunes would get sung, by whom, and in what order, etc. I know next to nothing about how this session was organized, but listening to some of the banter between and during the tracks, one gets the sense that even when they were at their most competitive, these guys had alot of respect for each other, and were able to let down their guard and their egos for this one moment in blues history order to just have some fun. Now I would agree with some of the previous reviewers that, individually, the performances are not particularly stellar. But you get the sense that these were pretty loose jams to begin with, and I doubt that they would have been able to produce the kind of spontaneity that is evident throughout this album had they gone into the studio planning to construct the ultimate blues supergroup studio album.  In fact, its hard to come up with examples of supergroup albums that sound nearly as much fun as this. So whatever your opinions are regarding the technical execution of the songs, this album must be regarded as a positive achievement. The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 is that I had hoped to hear more instrumental soloing from Bo and Muddy... but that's just me being greedy.
B00008438V|5.0|An amazing classic film! I love just as much as I did in the 80's HA!
0143038419|1.0|From the very first page of her book, I felt cheated....She was soul cleansing?   I don`t think so. For such and educated, and talented person, and she tells us that so many times in the book, I found the book depressing.  One hundred and forty someting times she is crying on the bathroom floor........Her flight to Italy left something wanting.  If she is eating well, share the delights of the food.  Take a tip from Frances Mayes.  Let us relish the experience with her......India and praying.....She really didn`t find or reach her spritual growth, and quite frankly, I could care less how many times she had to scrub the floor......Now, love,.....She has found the person to worship her in Bali.....I feel she is just a very needy person and even though we are led to believe she is an independent woman, her goal is simply a man....  I was never so relived to finish the book.
B000VNMMQG|3.0|I purchased several movies with this one but the others were not major productions.  However, I must say of the 4 I liked this one the least.  It didn't develope the characters and story line as well as the low budget ones did.  It was just okay for me, not wonderful.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a great film for everyone. Kids will adore it and adults will love it as well. It has a great cast, with a fabulously witty story, and the right music at the right time. For its day (2001) the state of the art computer animation was brilliant.<br /><br />The previous zillion reviews will tell you everything else you need to know. So buy this and Shrek 2 and get Toy Story and Toy Story 2 and you'll have all the best computer animated classics to date.<br /><br />Simply faultless.

0060776757|5.0|I am a U2 fan, but by no means am obsessed (trust me, I have friends who do fit that description).  This book has become one of my favorites to just flip open and read and enjoy.  Its passages are simultaneously humorous and sagacious.  That is saying nothing of the artful layout, design and photography of the volume.  You won't be disappointed.
0375707972|5.0|This book will have a permanent space in my library - have already recommended it to my friends as a 'must read' book. It is profoundly moving. What an excellent teaching tool this would be for students, for history buffs, for anyone trying to define 'MORALITY'. I cannot remember the last book that had such an impact and felt so true to it's form. This is a book whose message goes past World War II, it is universal and expresses important thoughts without preaching.

0525950079|5.0|One reads this novel with guilty pleasure and finds it impossible to set aside and tend to daily chores letting things slide about you as you eagerly turn the next page to find out the fate of these fascinating characters. It vividly brings to life a living history filled with portrayals that one loved or hated and that were so archetypal that they are easily found in our lives today.
1586210912|5.0|I am not very good at getting all the way through a book even if it is interesting!  This was a very easy listen and the author makes a lot of sense in an easy to understand way.<br /><br />Very helpful for those who own their own business and/or are in direct sales.

B000UVT3OI|3.0|I'm gonna buy this, only because I have to have \\"More than a Memory\\" in my collection for those DJ gigs where country music is a must.  What kind of DJ would I be without that song?  However, I'm saddened that for those of us who already own The Hits, we have to buy them again.  I'm not sure what the purpose of that is.  He could have used the space for those great missing tracks already mentioned in the previous reviews.  And i could care less about the videos.  I'm not a video watcher.  All I know is I'm paying an album price for 4 songs.... just like many others.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|No Spoilers.<br /><br />First, let me state for the record that it's a real shame that this film was completely overlooked by the Academy for 2007. Zodiac is easily the best film of the year. While it's just this one person's opinion, I know that many others feel the same about this film.<br /><br />David Fincher out does himself by creating a masterpiece that successfully shows the layman what used to happen in a Police investigation long before the days of everyone watching the intricacies of such on nightly television with shows like Cold Case, CSI and Law & Order.<br /><br />Clearly, the criminal justice system has come a long way, even in such a short time. What is really established is the short-comings of each department and with each set of Police Officers, who during their tenure, were actually good, solid investigators, but at the time had little communication between departments, counties and cities, which ultimately lead to the downfall of the investigation. It wasn't until Graysmith pulled all the facts, and of course some of his own, that a larger painting revealed what most likely occurred. Fincher does an excellent job at recreating each scene along the way, doing his best to be true the information and shedding light on new information that has been brought forward since then as well.<br /><br />Zodiac is a Police Procedural film in the truest sense and obviously covers the events of one of the most notorious serial killers ever to terrorize the minds of modern Americans. Mark Ruffalo gives a riveting performance as Inspector David Toschi and Jake Gyllenhal portrays Robery Graysmith, the cartoonist who became obsessed with the case and went on to write the most [[ASIN:0425098087 widely read non-fiction best-seller]] on the subject of the Zodiac.<br /><br />The attention to detail spent on the period is astounding and so far one of the best done for this period, the late sixties. It very easily puts Zodiac in a class of its own as a modern masterpiece which won't be easily forgotten, regardless of not receiving an award.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about the 2 disc set is the documentaries that Fincher put together interviewing EVERYONE that's still alive and that was even remotely associated with the case. I can't remember any crime documentary where they went this deep and were able to lay everything out on the table for the viewers to decide. In my opinion, these documentaries are unprecedented and could've been sold as a separate documentary in its own right.<br /><br />I always listen to the commentaries on as many films as possible as hearing what the writer's and the director want to say and giving you their unadulterated two cents, really pulls you deeper into the film. The commentary on this 2 disc set is absolutely fascinating and worthy of the time spent listening.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to add that the telling of the angle on Don Cheney and his interview made my jaw drop and crash to the floor. I couldn't believe my ears listening to Don Cheney speak. He's still alive, he's out walking around on foot and probably equally as guilty as an accomplice. I was stunned listening to that information. But don't worry, nothing that you just read was in any way cumulative of a spoiler.egardless of not receiving an award.

0792157869|4.0|Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is just back from retrieving the Cross of Coronado (a quest he's been on for years) when he gets the news.  His father (Sean Connery) has picked up the trail of the Holy Grail, a quest he's been on for years.  Unfortunately, Dr. Jones Senior has vanished.  So Indiana sets out for Venice to find his father.<br /><br />Once there, he realizes he and his father are in a race for time with the Nazis to find this holy relic.  The Nazis want to use it to create an army of invincible soldiers since the cup is rumored to create eternal life from those who drink of it.  The problem?  The Nazis have key pieces of research the two need to locate and retrieve it.  Can they find it first?  Will they make it out of this adventure alive?<br /><br />This movie is lighter in tone, much more like the first one then the second one.  In fact, I'd say it is the lightest of all three of them with fewer gruesome images then the first two.  (No, that doesn't mean this is for the squeamish, however.)  The acting is good, especially the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.  They look like they are having fun together on screen.  The story is clever and keeps you engaged with actions and plenty of laughs along the way.  I did feel the action got repetitive in the middle, however.  That's pretty much my only complaint.<br /><br />This movie is really nothing more then a mindless action film.  But it's very good at it.  If you are looking to be entertained, this movie will do it.
B000MV9026|5.0|I think think this is one of the cutest movies for kids out this year. I would watch it again.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|The extra scenes were all cut from the theatrical version for a good reason: They were unnecessary. They added nothing meaningful to the movie, and some even detracted from it.    The Fang versus Fiction TV feature was amusing, but silly.    The other features seem to be about the same as on the regular cut.    The case is nice.    If you own the original, this isn't worth buying. If you don't own the original, it's up to you. I prefer the theatrical cut. I got this thanks to a gift card and will probably be selling it as soon as I've shown it to a friend.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I watched this with my son  and I think it was a mutual love for the movie, we all enjoyed it our ages raged from 13 - 59 very cute movie. Pixar did it again.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I recently purchased Planet Earth and I am totally amazed at the footage.  This was well worth the money I spent. I am able to see parts of our world that I would never be able to see if it were not for the camera people that shot the films for Planet Earth. You will not be disappointed; every home should have this, especially if you have children or grandchildren. From the stars and planets above to the fish below, one cannot help but marvel at \\"how great is our God\\" when watching it! S.Swan, Bermuda
B000002I25|5.0|One of a kind, totally inovative. Most rock bands have been somewhat successfully imitated at some time or another, but what rock band sounds like the doors? There aren't any. The same could be said for the sound of the Who but otherwise I can't even think of any other bands with a more unique sound than the doors. Yes, almost every lead singer since Morrison has tried to somehow capture the presence, magnetism, and captivating personna the guy had, but they always fall short. When this album came out, it was like no other. Kreiger, Densmore, and Manzarek seemed to be born to create the stage for Morrison's lyrical theatre. They were all they have been said to be and more. I saw them live at the height of their popularity during one of the rare periods when Morrison was at least somewhat together and they were devastating to watch, and the memory of that night is seered into my brain. I had the same reaction to Hendrix. You would go to see these people and you thought that there was no way they could do live what they had done recording. Wrong! Like Hendrix, the Who, and a handful of others, they were magic. This first album has no weak link, and like the follow-up Strange Days, it is a masterpiece, a point in time where everything was kicked up a to a higher level, and the sophistication, mood, and quality of art has really never been duplicated. Certainly one of the five best albums of the sixties and a classic representation of what that era was all about. Country Joe, The Doors, Hendrix, The Airplane, The Byrds...man we have slid a long way from the class these bands represented to reach today's \\"MTV\\" awards.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is an awesome collection of Beatles hits.  It hits pretty right on- since their catalog isn't available online, this is pretty close to making your own mix of hits.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|i first saw this show on the BBC America network, and, I was hooked. i was never into this type of show before, but, for some reason, I was drawn to it like a magnet. The characters are so diverse. Especially, Captain Jack. i had to purchase this series, just so I could watch it over and over. I'm excited about the new season.  It is an excellent show!!!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|You need more? This movie looks so good in HiDef that I believe it was as good or better than the movie theatre image. Plus, the comforts of home! It's getting to be a better (and cheaper) experience than going to the movies.
B0000004UB|4.0|Great album of 1987.    I Surrender (To The Spirit Of The Night): sounds too much like Laura Bringhm's Self Control. This track is very good and I prefer the 12 Inch Version.    I Promise You: It would be a song sung  by Bananarama would do. But it's good but not good enough.    Lets applaud for Samantha trying her second freestyle hits from Touch Me to her debut with Full Force Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)best track ever and the remixes are outstanding especially with her rap parts. On the other hand, the rap parts were cut out from the greatest hits.    True Devotion: It was dissapointing that this song was on none of her greatest hits, but a it's a good song.    (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction beats Britney's version and it was the best cover of The Rolling Stones.    Nothing\\"s gonna Stop Me Now: cool song and great video. Nice song written by S A W.    If Music Be The Food Of Love sounds just like Pretty Poison's Catch Me I'm Falling and the song is very catchy    Tiffany would be perfect for That Sensation and the beat fits her    Dream City is a well postitive song about don't give up your dreams.    Best Is Yet to Come is good for a wedding.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This album is quite beautiful and slightly different from her other albums. In this album, there are one or two songs that she doesn't use a lot of synthesizers or whatever around her voice.  It's In the Rain is one of the songs, that I can just hear her voice naturally. And it's wonderful. She has such an interesting range.
B000007UA4|5.0|The adventures of \\"Sex Kylie\\" continues with her follow up and last album with Mushroom Records. Different from her previous albums, this album blends with Pop and R&B.    Word Is Out:Best song of the album. With the two versions I like. The album Version and the Summer Breeze mix. I was dissapointed when I bought the album she put the summer breeze mix instead of the album version which she put on most of her greatest its. album version is a New Jack Swing mix.    Give Me Just A Little More Time: A cover of The Chairman Of The Board. Great and a very cheerful song that can help with a bad day.    Too Much Of A Good Thing: samples Janet Jackson's Control mixed with Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's Let The Beat Hit Em. It combines with Pop and R&B. sexual but a great song especially with the moans.    Finer Feelings:I like both versions of the song, but I prefer the Brothers and Rhythm remix.    If You Were With Me Now: What a romantic duet with Keith Washington, but the song needs to be a little bit longer.    Let's Get to It: Short, but its similar to Color Me Badd's I Wanna Sex You Up\\" but it has the mood to listen to on the NYC subway train.    Right Here, Right Now: What a very sweet song and very happy.    Live and Learn: I really like the song alot especially with the New Jack swing Mode which something James harris and Terry Lewis would produce    No World Without You: Sad but a very good love song.    Best track is I Guess I Like It Like That. You can say this a preview to rave music and similar to 2 Unlimited's Get Ready For This. overall it's not a bad New Jack Swing album.
B001041JLE|3.0|\\"Thriller\\" has been called the greatest album of all time since it's 1983 release, and there is no wonder why.  Almost every song from the album was released and each song was successful on the charts.  The music from the original version is absolutely timeless!  Michael blended pop and R&B effortlessly and music listeners crowned him \\"The King of Pop.\\"  25 years after the release of \\"Thriller\\", Jackson (and with good reason) found it beneficial to release a special edition of the album, which includes updated versions of his classics and one track that was previously unreleased.  Jackson calls on Fergie, Will.I.Am, Kanye West, and Akon to assist him.  I was not impressed with what most of them contributed to the re-release.  They worsened the quality of timeless classics like \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"PYT.\\"  Of course, Jackson gets back into the studio to re-do the songs, but they should have left this album the way it was; why would one tamper with something near perfect?<br /><br /> \\"Thriller's\\" original version receives a 5 star rating without a shadow of a doubt.  However, when combining the old songs with this new stuff, the score is reduced 3 stars.  The producers attempted to conform Jackson's classics to the sounds which are in vogue for the moment, and the finished product is not pleasing.  Jackson and Akon team up for \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and it sounds alright, but when paying tribute to something, try to do the original it's justice.  The updated version of this song can't hold a candle or a flame to the original.  \\"Beat It\\" features Jackson and Fergie. Again, its studio beat and attempt to ape such a great song didn't work well.  Kanye administers the best song here with his version of \\"Billie Jean.\\"  His beat and slight alteration of the song work quite well; I applaud the two men for a job well done.<br /><br /> I encourage anyone who does not own \\"Thriller\\" to purchase as soon as possible and leave this anniversary edition on the shelf.  All you need is the 1983 renditions; this new stuff should have stayed at the studio.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />\\"Human Nature\\"<br />\\"PYT\\"<br />\\"Lady in My Life\\"<br />\\"Billie Jean\\"<br />\\"Thriller\\"lf.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|You will be totally amazed at the videography. I just can't figure out how some of the shots were accomplished. The slow motion of the Great White Shark breaching is spactacular. The crews that shot this video must have been magicians to get some of the detailed closeups of even the smallest of creatures. I couldn't stop watching this DVD. Great buy and well worth the cost.
B000SFJWLU|2.0|I think the music for this album is decent.  The vocals scream and sing back and forth and the music changes soft and hard to match, you could call it commercial and brutal.  When the singing starts it does not loose its flavor, but adds a lovely variety from just straight heavy screaming bands.  The drumming on the album gets pretty plain and mundane with steady double bass, kicks, with not too much variety for rhythm or style.  I found the lyrics below par.  The typical mad at the world and mad at yourself.  At one point the singer goes off screaming \\"I hate what I've become\\", great - then change, mature, grow up...etc.  I gave this two stars for its repeat playability, or lack there of.  After showing 3 or 4 friends a couple songs I was pretty much done with this album.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Asside from containing all 5 seasons, this set come in one of the coolest boxes ever. I looks just like the box from the show with all the same markings. It has hidden compartments, its held together by magnets, all the bonuses are fun. If you liked the show you'll really like this set. If you have never seen the show, then i'm not sure why you are thinking about getting a box set, but it is a great show and worth a watch.

1843104954|5.0|This was my first book on Aspergers - it was a great read.  I understand the Syndrome more now.  I with it had more on the Syndrome in toddlers - it seems that research is lacking on Aspergers in toddlers.  However, it was a great book and I recommend it to anyone going through Aspergers themselves or with their children.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I was thoroughly pleased with the Thriller Deluxe edition. I never bought any 2001 Special Edition, so I am glad this is the only one I am listening to. The album itself was excellent, lots of work with into it.  Will.i.am did great with the first two songs, \\"The girl is mine\\" I loved it. The remix was more upbeat than the original with today's flavor added to give it zing. Even P.Y.T. has an awesome beat to it.  The remixes were all good, but I was a bit disappointed with \\"Billy Jean\\". Although good, you didn't hear much of Kayne West doing what he does best. Akon, on the other hand, brought a different flava to \\"Wanna be startin something,\\" that makes the track sound even better.  You can tell the artists put their heart and soul into making this project with Michael Jackson, one of the best productions ever.  The deluxe edition, although expensive, gives you your money's worth. It is a piece of artwork put together. Photos, lyrics, credits, even some history and even more special it has a golden signature of Michael. It definitely is a great collector's piece of art.  I certainly recommend it. It's well worth the money.
B000TGJ8AS|3.0|it is not realistic to have these products region protected,  not in this 24h/ 7d a week world were internet is growing.    Now I have set 1,2 and 3 in region 2 and this one in region 1 since it is not and will not be made available in region 2
B00104W8T6|3.0|I loved the effect of the music while watching the film. It really enhanced my enjoyment of the movie, and added a dimension in \\"knowing\\" the characters. Unfortunately, once played at home, on its own, I found the music didn't \\"hold up\\". I admit that might be me...my musical taste is generally more sophisticated than this, so I believe for me, it played best within the context of film-viewing. Younger friends of mine, however, loved it!
B000BT99EI|5.0|Great DVD, get this if you like to see the extras and behind the scenes.
B0010ZR160|1.0|The only fact I knew prior to renting this movie was Ben Affleck directed it, and his brother Casey Affleck was the main character.  With that said I'm obviously ambivalent toward Ben Affleck for all the reasons everyone under the sun knows so I will spare the reader my soliloquy.  Casey Affleck on the other hand I've seen in a few indie flicks that didn't woo me to say the least.  Nonetheless I sat back without any inkling or hint of what the premise of this movie consisted of and let the movie speak for itself.<br /><br />First and foremost I had no empathy, sympathy, or encouragement to really enjoy/support any character whatsoever, especially Angie Monaghan's character (Gennaro).  Why may you ask?  A good movie just like a really good novel gives the movie-goer or reader an opportunity to know/understand a character, and once that is established it ultimately effects the movie-goers emotions, and I saw that didn't happen with this movie only up until the last 10 minutes I was finally sold on Kenzie's character as well as Helene's character.  Aside from the characters personalities, the acting particularly from Casey Affleck was absolute rubbish.  I give him no props for tackling a role that in essence didn't stand-out or evoke a uniqueness unfounded in his acting style.  Lets face it the Affleck's are from Boston, therefore Casey more or less was acting as if he wasn't acting.  Remember Courtney Love from \\"The People Vs Larry Flynt\\" as she was portrayed as a crackwhore? Hmm....didn't take a great deal of acting to pull that role off now did it Courtney?  I may be going overboard on his acting, but it just didn't help the movie.  I was anticipating more emotion, more emphasis, more bravado, yet all we got was a stuttering badass Bostonian.  How typical.<br /><br />The movie tried too hard to be unpredictable, and with that it left several open questions marks hurriedly pieced together in the little remaining time the film had left.  As an audience member I was forced to put on my CSI thinking caps to piece it together in order to see eye to eye with the characters as more unpredictability and CSI detective work was being unfolded.  I feel the events that took place throughout the entire movie to hide/protect Amanda was simply over the top and somewhat irrelevant.  Wouldn't Amanda question the whereabouts of her mother after being wist away to a country-side home living under the roof with a black man (Capt. Jack Doyle) and a white woman (Francine Doyle)?  I found it very selfish and hypocritical for Capt. Doyle to take away a child from it's mother, but is that what we as an audience need to mull over and question as a moral dilemma?  In my opinion the movie lacked or missed out on something to create it as a moral dilemma.  I feel Kenzie shooting the pedophile deemed more merit as a moral dilemma versus the decision-making over where Amanda would benefit greatly in maturing and living life to the fullest.  I felt the ending was self-evident and that is why we should dismiss the question of morality and ethics, and that is why I have a hard time  imagining people labeling this movie as controversial, surprising, and open to discussion.  Fast Forward to the very end where Kenzie is in Helene's house standing in the hallway chatting while Helene is getting ready for a date.  Helene takes off leaving Amanda all alone sitting on the couch watching television under the supervision of Kenzie.  Was the director (yes, Ben Affleck) trying to subliminally evoke his personal decision-making that would impact Amanda?  If that were the case than I give him credit for making a good point, and unfortunately that was the only point that fully impacted me as a viewer.on my CSI thinking caps to piece it together in order to see eye to eye with the characters as more unpredictability and CSI detective work was being unfolded.

B000O77V4W|4.0|I'm not particularly a fan of Justin Timberlake, but I watched this concert on HBO out of curiosity, and I was very pleasantly surprised. This guy puts on a good show, even if he does owe a royalty check to Michael Jackson, among others. The voice holds up well live, the band was solid, and the choreography was well done; it came together for a very tight, well-produced show. However, that's also part of what I don't like about it: it's so tightly produced and choreographed that there's no sense of spontaneity. Except for the specific references to New York and Madison Square Garden, you get the feeling that it is note-for-note, step-for-step the exact same show that concert-goers saw in Los Angeles, Phoenix and every other stop on the tour. That's about my only qualm with it though... for anyone who enjoys dance/pop music at all, this is worth checking out.
0671027344|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an 18 year old girl - I am 34 - so I was skeptical. One day, I found myself at my car dealership waiting on a repair so I decided, why not start reading this book? I couldn't put it down. I am about 30 pages from finishing it and though I can't wait to read it, I am procrastinating because I don't want it to be over. This book is amazing. It's simple yet descriptive. It's poignant yet dark. It's funny yet sad. You know these people in Charlie's life without really knowing them. Experiencing music and books, love and life through Charlie's eyes changes everything. I read somewhere that this book is literally banned in many high schools in America today. That's ludicrous! This book should be REQUIRED in high schools today. It gets people talking about things we don't talk enough about - like, suicide, homosexuality, drugs, sex, pressures of teendom, and boys who cry. Not to sound over-dramatic, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention... this book has changed me. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
1596061472|4.0|Coraline is a mesmerizing story, read very differently by adult and young readers. Only a master craftsman can pull that off. Had Gaiman written nothing else, he'd still merit genius status. Fortunately, he wrote more dream quality stuff: short stories (Snow Glass Apples, Murder Mysteries, Nicholas Was, Sunbird); great and diverse novels (Anansi Boys), picture books (Wolves in the Walls) and of course comics (Sandman!). Coraline, his first crossover YA book, rates 5 stars as story.    But this version. Subterranean has issued wow limiteds, like Tim Powers' novels with J.K. Potter art. This is not in that range. The original HC had the same Dave McKean art - only dustjacket & endpapers are new. Plus a few pics of a Coraline puppet play. Not enough to distinguish it from the first edition which stood out because of a nifty cover treatment that is necessarily missing from the original cover images included here. Production values are better, both McKean and Gaiman signed it, and yet... for execution, this merits only 3 stars.    Want value for money? Get Absolute Sandman and the Hill House limited editions. Perhaps this was issued too early, maybe it needed more time and thought to make it a dream book. Mind, for anyone new to Coraline, this edition will still blow you away. Hence 4 stars.

B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|This was a good show but in my opinion it's for the ladies. Guys be sure to have some tissues handy when she sings her squishier songs. I saw this show in Vegas and my wife ran out of tissues before the end of the show. I'm more into different music myself. Ladies you'll like this DVD. My wife sure did (she got a bit teary eyed for the Titanic song).
0143038419|1.0|Gilbert is a whiny, needy, self-absorbed, oblivious spoiled brat who -- in 300+ pages -- doesn't learn a thing. Her desperation to be with a man (even when the 2 are completely incompatible) is pathetic.    I rolled my eyes the entire time. It's amazing people buy into her self-pity. She's not depressed -- she needs a swift kick in the a**.    3 passages that annoyed me immensely:  1) her rented apartment in Rome isn't her NYC apartment, but it \\"will do.\\"  2) she doesn't want to insult anyone by comparing her experiences to the generations of harship and poverty the Sicilian people have suffered...and then continues to make the comparison.  3) David is her \\"soulmate\\". I miss David. I love David. Repeat. Whine. Repeat. Whine. Repeat. Whine. Repeat.    What a pompous waste of time.
0440234743|2.0|This is my seventh Grisham book and by far the most boring book I have read in a long time. So slow that I have decided to quite reading and I am almost finished. (I have never done that before) I am bewildered to all the 5 star ratings it has recieved. The Partner was a 5 star book. The Street Lawyer was a 5 star book. This is boring, slow and I did not enjoy this book. Sorry John.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I'm not often ever moved enough to write up a review on a new artist because being a child of the 80's, and usually stuck there, I too often snub new artists as rip offs from prior bands. Too many new bands lack originality, or just flat out lack talent. The problem these days with music is that a cd is released with one or two really good songs and the rest with filler. God, I miss the days when I'd buy a cd and it was brilliant from beginning to end.     Finally, alas, a new band that has really come through 100%. Originality? I'd have to say yes, sure there are many influences but the Fratellis have somehow crafted their own style. And what's present here that is usually missing these days? EXCELLENT MELODIES! This is such fun music to blare in the car and sing aloud to. Another incredible feat is that each song stands on its own. With each track, it's like a new story different than the one prior to it. How drab it is to listen to a cd and feel as if you just listened to one long boring track. Definitely not the case with Costello Music.     I've seen in other reviews this band being compared to others...in my opinion, they have a lot more going for them. Any band that can come up with truly catchy melodies these days are a true gem. A flash of the late 70's punk era, mixed with a splash of the Clash and Madness with some odd musical dashes of the 50's. What a mixed feel it is, but really a nice one. I guess that's what makes it sound fresh, new and original. Common ingredients but an entire new outcome.
0345494997|4.0|[[ASIN:0345495004 Loving Frank: A Novel]]This is a beautifully written book with many interesting twists of plot.   However, upon finishing this book the author revealed that the book is not actually true. Much was contrived. This left a negative feeling in my mind. If I were a family member of Frank Lloyd Wright I would be furious at the way his life was slandered. It reminds me of The Bridges of Madison County. What a letdown when this story is revealed to be fiction.  Wish I had not read past the end.

So you know how important he's become and how many buildings and golf courses are named after him. However, this book really outlines some useful business principles which I found incredibly useful. And always entertaining if you can take his boasting with a grain of salt.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This is not a silly movie about a car that comes to life like many reviews would have you believe.  It is so much more than that.  Carpenter is able to create such a haunting mood throughout the film through use of the 50s-style rock and Arnie's changing personality.  Normally it's so difficult for a director to grasp King's books and effectively put them on screen, but this one seems to nail it perfectly.  I get chills every time I watch it and it still holds up beautifully after 25 years!!

B000V78BOY|5.0|This performance is exceptionnal ; Papageno, Sarastro and the queen of the night performs superbly ; especially the queen of the night : in her most well-known aria, she manages litterally to radiate hate, and she's served by a perfectly mastered voice. I have 7 different versions of \\"Zauberflöte\\" ; this one is THE one. Plus, of course, the benefits of HD, biut even without HD it would have been outstanding.    For people who hates opera, or simply if it is your 1st time as an opera lover, try this one. Really.
0671646788|5.0|Folks, this is VITAL information:     If you consider yourself mature enough for critical self-reflection, and even MORE mature enough to take immediate action, this book is written to de-program the reader from being a zombie, and REALIZE, perhaps for the first time, since you were a child, just what a magnificent creature you are and the INFINITE possibilities that surround you.    This is required reading for all my REPS.    DISCLAIMER FOR WOMEN: Please understand this was copy written in 1959, a different place in America - the \\"NUCLEAR FAMILY\\" and women's roles were arguably, quite different from what we presently enjoy, so if you can look past the historical colloquialisms of the era, you can find a great resource here. Good luck in your search, it MAY be over!!!!

B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I know in my head what Jesse Stone looks like and it's not Tom Selleck.  However, having said that, Selleck does a perfect Jesse Stone.  In fact, all of the actors portray Parker's characters beautifully.  Even the music and photography capture the tone of the books.  It must be a difficult, if not almost impossible, job to take a book series & successfully transfer it to the screen without sacrificing some aspect.  I've bought Stone Cold and 3 other Jesse Stone dvd's and haven't been disappointed in one of them.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Her style is somehow like a Bruce Horsnby and Maroon 5.Love songs has a great beat and Gravity is a beautifull love song. City is another lovely soft song, in fact every single song is quite a treat. She has an excellent poise if you watch her perform. Of the young talents coming out, she is the top of the cream.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|No words can express how incredible this concert is. Superb sopranos, orchestra, not a single thing can be defined as excellent. Mairead Nesbeitt is a hell of a fiddle player and she is so beautifull that you'll feel like you are in heaven sorrounded by angels when Chloe, Orla, Lisa, Meav, and Hayley join her and sing. They are simply outstanding.
184195425X|1.0|Enough has been said here regarding the plot of this book. I have just two things to say: 1)the first 25 pages were the highlight of the book for me. Martel seems to construct the analogy between what we often think of as human freedom as opposed to the life of animals in zoos and their lack of freedom. He rightly points out how it is all the same. We humans are as much caged-in as the animals are, in as much as both animals and humans may prefer it that way; and in the end our caged existences are our freedom. 2)the book went down hill from there and I became terminally bored with it!

But the pictures and the humor of the story told through the pictures is both different and charming everytime you look at it, which with my grandchildren is several times a day, at least.  This is a book to buy many times and to give as a gift as often as you need one.  Oversized is better.
B000MZHW40|5.0|\\"Blood Diamond\\" is a mixture of action, drama and a realistic portrayal of how one man can make a difference while staring into the face of true evil. Based in Sierra Leone \\"Blood Diamond\\" draws the viewer into the world of corruption, genocide and the horrors committed by men driven by greed.  Although this movie is definitely not for children it has a strong appeal for both men and women.  This is not just a mindless action movie.  It is a thought provoking movie that is charachter driven.  You will feel like you know each of the main characters intimately long before the movie is over.  \\"Blood Diamond\\" is one of the most thrilling, suspenseful, action packed and thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of a life time with Djimon Hounsou bringing to life his character with powerful dramatic execution.<br />This movie is a must see!  Definitely 5 stars!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Wonderful singer!  I love it that he mainly sticks to the old classics, Sinatra tunes in particular.  Buble even sounds like Sinatra in some songs.  Anyway, love his choice of music, plus he's always got a great orchestra behind him.  Quality CD!
1569242739|5.0|This little book is worth it's weight in gold.  I am not a vegan but we have multiple food allergies in our family, including dairy and eggs.  Since this book is for vegans, none of the recipes contain animal products, which takes care of the egg and milk issues.  In addition, this book offers all kind of information on substitutions of different flours, sweeteners and non-dairy items like nut and rice milks. Some recipes are gluten-free as well. I found this book more helpful than the dozen others I have that are written for people with allergies!  The recipes are delicious and you would never know they didn't contain the \\"usual\\" ingredients.  The book is also written in a very entertaining and quippish way, which makes it more friendly to we less experienced bakers.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to prepare a dairy and egg-free sweet treat.  My only suggestion to the authors would be to add stevia to the list of alternative sweeteners.
B00062IVKS|3.0|The acting and the photography of the fight sequences are quite good. The problem lies in the quality of the DVD itself. The first copy I received was not playable and was returned. The second copy played ok, but the contrasts in volume between the conversation parts and the fight sequences were extreme. One could hadly hear the conversation portions and had to turn the volume up near its maximum. When the fight sequences occurred, the volume had to be turned back down. This soon became annoying. I am surprised that the anniversary edition had these problems.  The special features disk was trouble-free and well worth watching.
B0010ZR160|5.0|That quote, from novelist Dennis Lehane and taken from one of the \\"making-of\\" featurettes available on the DVD, pretty much sums up the whole point of \\"Gone Baby Gone.\\"  I'll sum up the plot briefly: a child is kidnapped from the home of her crack-dealing single mother, and two private investigators are hired to find her.  What begins as a complicated case turns tragic, heartbreaking, and a moral issue for the ages.<br /><br />First of all: Ben Affleck can direct.  Sure, sure, he obviously takes his cues from the greats before him...but who doesn't?  Affleck takes a great script (which he co-wrote, based upon a great novel) and makes a great movie.  Boston becomes a central character; Affleck captures this by casting many true-life Boston citizens (as one \\"actor\\" states: \\"There's no actors in there\\") in many of the roles, giving the movie the lived-in feel that it requires.  Let's face it: despite the caliber of acting, despite the amazing script, if the movie didn't have Boston, the movie wouldn't have anything.<br /><br />Let's go back to the acting, because that's what drew me in.  Casey Affleck, Ben's little bro, is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors (see him also in \\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford;\\" that movie, combined with this, will quickly erase any doubts about this man's talent).  As his girlfriend/partner, Michelle Monaghan oozes charm and charisma as always.  Amy Ryan, as the girl's mother, is a wonder to behold; she highly deserves her Best Supporting Actress nod (and if she wins, you won't hear any complaints from me).  It's unfortunate that Ed Harris, who delivers one of his best performances, isn't nominated; as a hard-hitting detective who isn't afraid to bend the rules, he steals every scene he's in.  Then there's Morgan Freeman; in the first half of the movie, his talent isn't readily evident (it's a bit hard to get past his traditional wise-man persona).  When he shows up later in the film, though, the viewer is quickly reminded why Freeman is one of the best actors to ever grace the screen.<br /><br />Ultimately, as intimated in the title line of this review, \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a thinking-man's crime drama.  It isn't meant to leave you feeling nice and comfortable; it's meant to leave you shaken, edgy, as if something wasn't right.  What is \\"the right thing?\\"  How do we know it when we see it?  How do we know it when we do it?  These are the questions you'll leave this movie with.  If you're not comfortable questioning your own humanity, then I reccommend going to see some other flick; I hear Paris Hilton has a new one coming out.  But if you don't mind feeling uncomfortable, if you don't mind watching a crime drama that is actually thought-provoking, then by all means watch this one.  You'll get your money's worth and a whole lot more.ded why Freeman is one of the best actors to ever grace the screen.

0890090572|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is one enduring character, written with the analytical reader in mind, with Conan Doyle presenting the logic and the reasoning as detailed as the story itself.<br /><br />This particular edition, is the perfect one. Comfortably large size, easy on the eyes, hardbound is elegant and somehow I found it very easy to position it anyways I wanted, whether I was sitting upright with the book on the desk, or when in travel with the book on my lap, lying on my side with the book on the left. I thought this is important to mention , now ofcourse to the content..<br /><br />The higlight of this edition is the illustration collection by Sydney Paget, as they appeared when it was first published. It is significant to read the stories with Sydney Paget's illustrations, since Sydney Paget practically defined the way Sherlock Holmes appeared. though Conan Doyle's descriptins can lead one to visualize Holmes, it was Sydney who set it on paper. and the fact that he was working along with Conan Doyle, brings in the authenticity and approval of the visual representation of the stories. Sydney Paget ofcourse is a master illustrator, with fascinating black and white illustrations capturing all the drama in the stories.<br /><br />The book contains,<br />37 short stories and a complete novel from The Strand Magazine. With all 356 original illustrations by Sidney Paget.<br /><br />Stories included are<br />The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, published in The Strand between July, 1891 and December, 1892 (12 stories);<br />The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Published in The Strand as additional episodes between December, 1892 and November, 1893 (12 stories);<br />The Hound of the Baskervilles, published in The Strand between August, 1901 and April, 1902; and<br />The Return of Sherlock Holmes, published in The Strand between October, 1903 and January, 1905 (13 stories).

B000FP2OPY|5.0|You don't have to be a SciFi fan to enjoy this series, because it is all about the relationship between two brothers with SciFi as a backdrop.  Each episode is a mini-movie and the writing, acting, directing and editing are some of the finest found on TV.  Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys seeing those points come together.  I've become a Jensen Ackles fan through this series.  I enjoy seeing a subtle actor and he pins his character down from the beginning, but don't discount Jared Padalecki either.  Both are great actors and together they are awesome.  Half way through the first season, the show hits its mark and the second season is even better than the first.

B00009UW0N|5.0|This is my 100th review and what better than Halloween? This review is dedicated to all my Amazon friends!<br /><br />When it comes to Halloween the reason this is one of the all time greats is because of it's simplicity of the movie. The plot is straight forward and quite simple. Movies don't need a deeper meaning or complex plot to be great. Halloween is a simple concept set in an ordinary world. Unlike some genre movies the power of Halloween comes from the suspense and not constant violence.<br /><br />If you wanna be a filmmaker there are certain movies of that genre in which you wanna work in that you have to see. If you wanna work in horror, Halloween is one of those movies you have to see. I've seen Halloween so many times and broken down every aspect of the movie. The only problem with that is I notice some of the flaws. But Halloween is one of the films every single horror filmmaker must see. The reason this movie works so well is that Carpenter doesn't try and scare you every single moment. There are only so many scary scenes a movie can do before they fall flat. What Carpenter does with Halloween is makes one of the most tension filled horror movie of all time and that is why Halloween is so scary.<br /><br />He scares us because he keeps us in suspense; Halloween is so creepy due to Michael just watching. He's not attacking he just stands there and watches. We don't know when he will strike. That raises the tension and again the fact he is just watching is what makes it so scary because it's so damn creepy. I don't care what kind of horror movie you wanna make. Halloween is text book horror filmmaking. Any filmmaker with even just a little bit of talent can create a jump scare. Most of the time we jump out of a reaction not because we are scared; something pops out at you it's a reaction. John Carpenter has some jump scenes, but they are scary because of the suspense he already built unlike other filmmakers that just throw them out there Carpenter has already built the suspense so the jump scare isn't just a cheap tactic.<br /><br />The screenplay by John Carpenter & Debra Hill is fairly good the idea is simple and that's why it works. Despite the reputation the screenplay has it really isn't anything special. There are some weak moments and quite honestly with a lesser filmmaker, Halloween could have made for a rather boring movie. Its John Carpenter's brilliant directing is why Halloween was so scary. That's not to say the script for Halloween was bad. Most people say the strongest part of the screenplay is the girl talk and the pure evil sections are the weaker ones. I actually have to disagree with that.<br /><br />Debra Hill was more of the brains behind the girl talk and that was the weaker part in my opinion. Debra Hill was a fantastic writer and producer. She made some great movies with Carpenter, but she also did a lot of solid work without him. The scenes with the 3 girls aren't bad, but its Carpenter's eerie feel is why it works. Some of the dialogue is actually a little weak at times. When Laurie mentions forgetting her books, Lynda than goes on and on about always forgetting her books is almost cringe worthy. Carpenter's eerie feel again is what makes this such a brilliant horror movie and therefore it's easy to over-look any possible flaws in the script.<br /><br />The scene though with Annie and Laurie driving to go baby-sit is a very well written scene the dialogue feels natural and real. It's just at times some of the dialogue doesn't quite work. And again I'm not saying it's bad, because it isn't. I just feel some of the dialogue lacks at times. The scenes with Loomis and Sheriff Brackett for me are the strongest sections of the script, but also it could actually play out a little boring, but the actors, Pleasence is particular is really able to sell the scenes big time. Overall the screenplay is good, but not great again it really comes to John Carpenter as a director on why this is such an amazing horror flick.<br /><br />Director John Carpenter really does knock it out of the ballpark here; Halloween is a masterpiece of filmmaking. Like I said the script was alright. There were strong moments and some weak moments, but John Carpenter creates one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. I love the wide shots he really makes the best of it and we soak in this atmosphere and in the more tension filled scenes he moves the camera in for closer shots and we feel that isolation and feel cut off and stuck. These are simple horror filmmaking techniques, and they work so well and make this one really scary.<br /><br />Halloween would probably rate as my all time favorite horror movie, but it's not a perfect movie. But the thing is the sense of dread, doom and isolation are so perfect that any possible flaw is wiped out due to that. In many ways, Halloween is the perfectly made horror movie. I truly believe with a lesser filmmaker Halloween could have made for a boring film. Despite what I said about the screenplay, there are those types of films that can be very well written, but with the wrong director the movie could fail. Halloween is one of those movies; with a lesser director, Halloween could have been a slow paced and some what boring movie.<br /><br />But Carpenter creates such a chilling feel and due to that the movie runs at this brilliant pace. There really isn't a slow moment due to how creepy and suspenseful the movie is. After the first kill scene the next on camera kill scene takes about 45 or so minutes, but due to Carpenter constantly building the tension in every single shot it gets creepier and creepier. I've heard some people say they like Halloween, but it's too slow. I have to disagree. There aren't any slow moments due to the fact each scene some how moves the movie forward; either the character development or the story. Each scene also has a creepy feel due to Michael always lurking around. For me a slow paced movie is one where the plot or characters aren't advanced. Each scene in Halloween does one of those two things or it creeps you out. This is one of the rare horror movies where the viewer is held in suspense from beginning, middle to end. Even the most normal of scenes of just random talk have this overall creepiness to them, which isn't as easy task.<br /><br />Halloween proves you don't need constant violence to make a really scary movie. Michael Myers simply waiting and watching makes the movie so scary that it makes up for the lack of action. And when the action finally does come about we are already on the edge of our seats and are held in such suspense that now when Michael does attack it makes it even scarier. And due to so much time being spent with Laurie Strode when Michael attacks her since we got to know the character and care for her it makes the scenes so much scarier. I always say the scariest horror films are the ones when we like the characters. If we don't care about them at all most of the suspense will be lost due to that.<br /><br />And of course the music, which was composed by John Carpenter, is just chilling. I've seen a lot of horror movies and Halloween just might have the best score of any horror flick and I believe can rival any movie for that matter. When the opening credits begin and the Halloween Theme is playing already right there Carpenter manages to suck you into the movie. The music does play a big part in why this movie is so scary. The way Carpenter directs the movie is so chilling and than we add the music and that elevates the movie even more.<br /><br />Like I said for me the scariest scenes in Halloween are the ones where Michael is just watching. I love the scene when Laurie is in school and Michael is outside watching. But my very favorite scene is when she's home and he's standing right outside her window looking up. No matter how many times I see the movie that scene always really freaks me out.<br /><br />The acting is a little mixed, while none ofthe actors are bad some though are stronger than others. Donald Pleasence really was so amazing. He was such an amazing and a much underrated actor. He could play a role straight, but also knew when to lighten up and play it over the top when it's called for. It's sad that most people seem to remember Pleasence for the Halloween series. He really was so much better than that. And when I mean the Halloween series I mean the sequels. There's no shame being remembered for the original Halloween.<br />Any scene involving Donald Pleasence is just great. He really sells every line he says.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis also gives a solid performance in her feature film debut. It may not be her best, but it's very good. She plays the role as the heroine very well and she's believable and sympathetic and very likeable. Charles Cyphers is also excellent, he's not given a whole lot to do, but he makes the very best of it. Nancy Loomis is pretty good if not a little uneven and P.J. Soles does ok. I'm actually a very big fan of P.J. Soles, she is one of my favorite actresses, but her performance is mixed, but in fairness even though her role is small she has the weakest dialogue in the film. I liked the character, but she really did have the weakest lines.<br /><br />Nick Castle who played Michael Myers was the best actor to play him in the whole series. He was just downright creepy. Michael is just pure evil; there is nothing left inside of him. He's evil in the shape of a man. It's like he isn't even human anymore. There is nothing left inside of him, but evil. No remorse and no feelings. To this day Michael Myers in the original scares me.<br /><br />Halloween really is one of the all time greats and I would rate this as possibly my very favorite horror movie. Like I said the script was a little weak in some areas, but the direction and music by Carpenter make up for that. Halloween is a simple movie set in an ordinary world and that is what makes this movie so scary. Halloween has gone down in history as one of the all time greats of the genre and it's very well deserving of that. Halloween deserves all the credit it gets. It's a simple movie that aims to scare and very few horror movies deliver the type of chills Halloween does.e two things or it creeps you out. This is one of the rare horror movies where the viewer is held in suspense from beginning, middle to end. Even the most normal of scenes of just random talk have this overall creepiness to them, which isn't as easy task.    Halloween proves you don't need constant violence to make a really scary movie. Michael Myers simply waiting and watching makes the movie so scary that it makes up for the lack of action. And when the action finally does come about we are already on the edge of our seats and are held in such suspense that now when Michael does attack it makes it even scarier. And due to so much time being spent with Laurie Strode when Michael attacks her since we got to know the character and care for her it makes the scenes so much scarier. I always say the scariest horror films are the ones when we like the characters. If we don't care about them at all most of the suspense will be lost due to that.

B000P12LWY|4.0|I love the Tudors. I think they did a wonderful job. The casting and everything about it was wonderful. That period in history was full of great charactors and just so much action so why oh why did they mess with historical facts. Henry had two sisters. Margaret and Mary. They seem to have made one person out of two people here. It does not work simply because one sister married into Scotland and that was why when Elizabeth died with no heir, the throne went to Scotland. There was more than enough material to work with here and this version did nothing to add to the story or to dramatize it. So why.........it did not make sense. Otherwise I would have said 5 stars were not enough. As it is I only gave it 4. The costume designers were up front about taking some liberty there but that was not relevant and actually added to the sense of style that went with Henry and his court. Not so with his sister............

B0000080KG|5.0|A record Mingus himself famously declared his masterpiece, and you know what? I think he's right. Yeah, this is his best release! And correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this was one of the first concept albums. I mean, come on, it's a jazz ballet. That is beyond artsy. The tracks all run together as one, there are repeated musical themes, and, um... actually, that's about all I've got to back up my \\"concept album\\" theory. But hey, isn't that all a concept album needs? Of course it is. And hey, it's a fantastic concept album! A clear influences is Ellington, who had a similar \\"classical jazz\\" approach, wrote several famous suites of his own, and also worked with massive bands. Plus the brass-heavy sound definitely can be attributed to the Duke. But Mingus had interests in free jazz and Spanish music that I'm pretty sure are almost entirely absent in Ellington's catalog, which are taken into account as well. The result is something unique and fascinating, an album that can be rigid and organized as any classical work or an explosive free-jazz meltdown. Mingus' eclectic taste in music highlights the record - where else can you find an album that contrasts big-band trombones and muted trumpets with whirlwind flutes and Spanish guitar breaks? Or fantastically insane melodies that burst into chaotic, but always listenable ensemble soloing? Now, all this would be for nothing if the music itself was terrible, but it's far from it. The piece winds through a wide variety of emotions, evoking calm, happiness, ecstasy, confusion, rage, and so on in a way that nobody else but John Coltrane. It's ambitious for sure, but ambition is just a part of the Mingus experience, and besides the guy's got enough talent to back it up. If you're interested in jazz, give it a listen. If you're interested in unique music, give it several listens. If you're interested in both, play it daily.
0784011680|4.0|Attenborough's Chaplin offers a more politicalized perspective on this iconic star of American cinema. The film focuses on Chaplin's (played by Robert Downey Jr.) rise and fall in American film, culiminating in his exile from the United States after Hoover's relentless attempts to prove him a communist threat finally succeeded. Downey Jr. is really quite good as Chaplin, especially in the evolution of his English accent. (Although as the elderly Chaplin, he is a bit creepy). Anyone who is a tried and true fan of Chaplin, however, will find many details to criticize: his facial expressions aren't quite right, his physical movements don't quite capture the grace of Chaplin's. But, overall, it is a fine film, offering a fascinating glimpse of the personal and political life of perhaps the greatest film star of all time.

It is still as great as ever - better than I remembered, probably because I have a better appreciation now for Mayall and what he contributed to the world. Clapton was just about to reach God status and it's easy to see why his rise was meteoric.
0375847227|5.0|This book incorporated three stories - The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass.  I brought the books with me on vacation, on the recommendation of a friend who reads a lot of (and teaches) adolescent literature, a genre I haven't touched in 20 years.  I was really impressed with the stories - the themes of freedom, adventure, innocence/experience, stewardship, friendship - it was an amazing trilogy.  I recommend it.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I've always loved Blade Runner. It's one of my favourite films and so the chance to own a perfected, high resolution version on Blu Ray was not to be missed.  Being in the UK, I searched Amazon.co.uk and found that a two disc Blu Ray offering was available, but, according to the reviews, it seemed that it wasn't good value when compared with a 5 disc version available from Amazon.com in the states.  I was delighted to find that the main feature was as good as I'd hoped and that the other 4 discs contained extensive background features about the concept and making of the film. There was even an interview with Philip K Dick discussing the omissions from the film with respect to his Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep novel.    If you loved the film Blade Runner and though that it is a classic sci-fi based on a great novel then you MUST get this box set.    If you're just looking for the latest action film then this isn't for you.

B0011Z5NHS|4.0|Dimitra Theodossiou est la nouvelle Norma de cet enregistrement du festival de Macerata 2007. Il faut se souvenir que Norma fut l'un des derniers rôles scéniques de Maria Callas, qu'elle abandonna en 1965 à l'opéra de Paris. Après elle, d'autres cantatrices s'emparèrent du rôle avec succès : Sutherland et Caballé, bien sûr, mais aussi Scotto et Verrett, notamment.... Et puis, et puis, dans les années 90, ce fut le désert.... Seule Edita Gruberova releva le défi, avec succès, certes, mais avec une approche dramatique assez proche du concours de grimaces et de gesticulations peu orthodoxes, en regard du mélodrame romantique.  Ce spectacle est donc le bienvenue pour rappeler que Norma est une rôle complexe et riche, qui demande énormément en termes de maturité vocale et de technique belcantiste. Ici, les conditions sont amplement remplies, avec un spectacle sobre (totalement opposé au show Gruberova) et des partenaires efficaces. Dans un cadre magnifique, le metteur en scène a su recréer une gestuelle digne des théâtres antiques, et redonner vie à une oeuvre que peu de maisons d'opéras osent remonter de nos jours.

B0000035E7|4.0|\\"Bleach\\" was recorded in 1989, and during that time period, very little was known about the seattle music scene, expect those that lived there, or word of mouth was spread through the underground. Mind you, even though in 1989 there was an alternitive rock scene and a punk scene (even though many artist of this genere still were not introduced into the pop-rock scene), Nivana took sounds of both, and there are even hints of heavy metal , and created a sound that would not take off into the mainstream until three years later. So, does this mean that this is an good album, just because it was ahead of its time. Yes, it is a very good album, and even though David isn't drumming here, the musicanship is still tight, with plenty of rawness that will satifsy the most hard-core rock junkies. Yes I say rock, I will never use to term grunge to coin music. It was just a silly pop culture term to describe the clothing the artist wore. Anyway, Bleach still seems like a lost treasure. Even though the acousic version of \\"About a Girl\\" got lots of airplay, it was the version off of unplugged, not this. In fact, its a shame that most of these songs dont get airplay, and never did even during the peak of the bands popularity. \\"Bleech\\" might not be \\"In Untero\\" (the bands best album) when it comes to finally getting it all together, but it was a start, and with 13tracks on this album, nine of them are great, that one helluva effort for a debut album. Please try this one on, even if you arent a fan of Nivana, because if you are someone that likes Indie, Extreme Metal, or any form of music that isnt pop, give this a chance. YOu might hate Nirvana because of their extreme popularity since \\"Nevermind\\" was released, but this one is much different, and some will love the garage type sound that this one gets. ENJOY
B000K15VSA|5.0|OK. I admit that I am a pretty big Phillip K. Dick fan.<br /><br />But while \\"Blade Runner\\" is not exactly what was written in the book (L.A. versus San Francisco), Ridley Scott's vision is just as fantastic as [[ASIN:1857988132 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Millennium SF Masterworks S)]]<br /><br />And this Ultimate Collector's Edition is just too cool! I've already watched the Final Cut version three times since I got it in January '08. And I feel I must watch it again soon... (OK, I'm a little nerdy, but I don't go to Star Trek conventions... yet.)<br /><br />I've gone through some of the extra stuff, (interviews, deleted scenes, etc.) which was created with the same attention to detail as the movie, including the cool \\"Deckard\\" brief case and collector's items, like the \\"silver\\" origami swan that Edward James Olmos' character leaves for Deckard, and I really like it. I've never purchased a \\"collector's set\\" like this before; it's very impressive.<br /><br />Hardcore fans of \\"Blade Runner\\" will really love this set!

0385337388|5.0|I have somewhat mixed feelings about this book. It is beautifully written, by a REALLY gifted writer, who describes an intern's experiences (first year training in a hospital after completing medical school) on the units he is assigned to cover.       One has to have been there (I was, as a nursing student) to follow and appreciate many of this character's experiences. Some sound hyper and exaggerated. This is true for relationships with patients and those with other hospital personnel: from administrators to  nursing personnel, ancillaries, and outsiders. The book manages to be hilarious, serious, sad, and often true. Laymen beware! Much in this book is invention, scary to read for potential patients as it describes how interns view new admissions, and how badly they feel treated by their superiors. I'll go with the inventions for what they are, admire the writing, but want to assure future readers there really is concern and compassion for patients in the hospitals I know.
0743297334|4.0|The Sun Also Rises was really the first introduction I have had with Hemingway, and I went away with some mixed feelings. I recognized the story as being simple on the surface, but very complex with some very profound undercurrents, and the reader is free to read it either way and still come away with something of value. The thing that took some getting used to was Hemingway's style of very short and exact sentences. Unlike mine. At times the style worked beautifully, conveying emotion even with the medium of the sentence itself, but at other points, it seemed to drag. However, this is not going to sway me from reading any of his other novels, and in fact, this work has left in me a desire to read more of his work to discover why he is thought of as such a master.

B000AARKOO|5.0|I've seen the movie up on the videostore shelf for the longest time but didn't rent it because I thought it sucked. I finally did on this weekend and, to my amazement,this movie was actually really, really good! I'm surprised it tanked at the box office. It is likely due to poor endorsements. But Orlando Bloom  and Liam Neeson delivered outstanding performances and the set up and storyline were just out of this world. It gives you an idea how Jerusalem came to be what it is now. I am buying the Blueray DVD  to add to my collection.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|My corny title is not just there to be funny in a stupid way, as it is also meant to convey to horror fans who have not seen SAW, thinking it to be another HOSTEL/HILLS HAVE EYES/any \\"let's torture young people for fun instead of trying to be, you know, scary\\" movie, that it's definitely worth their time. I have not seen SAW's sequels (though I liked this one enough to see the others), but I can say that this movie is more in the SE7EN kind of vein than the torture porn flicks we've been subjected to over the last few years. Yes, it is quite often gruesome, graphic, and disturbing, but it is all accredited to a very clever and darkly interesting premise.<br />We are introduced to our two protagonists (if they can be called that, as they have their vices) first, workaholic doctor Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and cocky youngster Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell), who awaken in a dark room resembling a larger version of a prison cell, each of them chained to pipes adjacent from each other. In the center is a dead body holding an unloaded gun with a gunshot wound to the head and a tape recorder. Adam and Lawrence each have tapes to be played on that recorder, on which a raspy voice, their captor, informs Lawrence that he must kill Adam by 6:00 that night, or he will kill Lawrence's wife and daughter. To further explain what could possibly be going on, Adam and Lawrence both tell certain stories about their past, leading to flashbacks where we are introduced to other key characters like policeman Det. David Tapp (Danny Glover) and his partner, Det. Steven Sing (Ken Leung), who are on the trail of the Jigsaw Killer, a sadistic serial killer who forces his victims to save their own lives through twisted puzzles and games. Lawrence believes this Jigsaw is their holder, and that Tapp believes Lawrence is somehow in cahoots with Jigsaw. More plot complications pile on top of each other, leading to the bloody, shocking finale, which whether you like it or not, is a doozy.<br />Writer Whannell and director James Wan, both newcomers, showcase a great confidence towards filmmaking, as Whannell's writing is very fluid and engrossing (I'm not saying he's David Mamet, but for someone not much older than college age he's very talented) and Wan's direction points toward a long future in filmmaking. Elwes should have won some sort of horror acting award or at least award for best desperate screaming and wailing (something I can't quite say for Whannell, a much better writer than he is an actor, though he's more than adequate in his role). I can't tell you if the sequels are able to have a nice psychological thriller along with the blood and guts, but this one has it and more.ll and director James Wan, both newcomers, showcase a great confidence towards filmmaking, as Whannell's writing is very fluid and engrossing (I'm not saying he's David Mamet, but for someone not much older than college age he's very talented) and Wan's direction points toward a long future in filmmaking.

HIS NEW SIDEKICK JUSTIN LONG IS A WELCOME ADDITION TO THE MANY PARTNERS JOHN MCLANE HAS HAD.  THE INCLUSION OF HIS DAUGHTER JUST RAMPS UP THE TENSION AND MAKES IT FUN.  THE BAD GUYS ARE THE TYPICAL BUNCH OF PETTY THIEVES PUTTING ON A SHOW TO STEAL BIG.  THEY ARE DEFINITELY A GOOD MATCH AGAINST PAST ENEMIES AND SHARE THE SAME LOATHING OF THE MEDLESOME JOHN MCLANE.

B000TGCR3S|5.0|Its easy to get burnt out on Anime with the same old story told again and again and again. Young pre-teen boy/girl develops mysterious super powers they didn't know they had to fight an evil that happens to show up at the same time their powers. The young hero transforms into their \\"true form\\" at the final scene to vanquish the evil foe... boring and very juvenile.<br /><br />However, every once in a while a true gem will be made that reminds you why you love this genre. Tekkon Kinkreet is such a movie. Its got it all: Incredibly unique storyline, excellent visuals (backgrounds and city, the characters were drawn simply on purpose), characters you truly care about (I got choked up twice during this movie), and voice acting that isn't horrible. Sure it doesn't have giant mecha robots that crash into and blow up a seemingly infinite supply of buildings, but hey, anyone over 15 years old usually considers that a plus.<br /><br />If you love anime then do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie. I purchased it as a good movie to show people who are new to the genre.
B000OV170W|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I was assigned to listen to the audiobook version of this novel. I wasn't aware of Ms. Picoult and only had a short synopsis to base expectations. I was instantly engaged in the characters and the story and experienced something with this book I had only previously had happen in a few other books. In The World According to Garp, I found myself in tears when Walt died. I couldn't explain it, but the way Irving introduced this information completely took me by surprise. There are several such instances in this book, making it one of my latest faves. Check it out!

1590171993|5.0|We read this book for a discussion group and everyone liked it, often for different reasons.  It is superbly written and psychologically interesting.  Stoner is a farm boy, a son of undemonstrative parents \\"of the land\\".  At University he discovers the world of literature and becomes a teacher instead of a farmer. The book details his relationship with teaching; and also his marriage and fatherhood. One could feel that Stoner is too passive in his marriage, but the choices he had were limited considering his background and the times.  His wife, Edith, is perhaps a little too \\"black\\" when some more \\"gray\\" would make her more sympathetic.  What could have been a depressing life story in other hands was instead a fascinating portrait of a man and his life.  Highly recommended.

1580084621|2.0|I'm no slouch in the kitchen and I've found nearly every recipe in this book astonishingly hard to make. Most of that is derived from the ridiculous lists of ingredients required to prepare every dish. It may be the most authentic Thai cookbook around, but it shouldn't require you to live in Thailand in order to make anything in it. Even in NYC it's hard to find a lot of this stuff. It probably has a lot of good recipes, but most of us will never know...
B0002EQ7E2|4.0|I love this CD.  I've played the \\"Graceland\\" track over and over.  It's been my favorite, although \\"Under African Skies\\" is outstanding.  The man is clearly a poet -- maybe a genius.
B000VI70WM|4.0|Somebody call the Rug Doctor, RCM's guts are all over the place! To anyone who thinks this is called \\"experimental\\" or \\"new\\" has listen to waaay too much electronic dance music. I found DD's latest work to be a total disappointment, sounding like everyone else, sacraficing good guitars, bass, and even drums. IMO, this kind of music made mostly by a machine just gives me the impression that bands/artists are getting lazy. RCM, I believe, will not be remembered as a classic (after seeing how people turned their backs on it).    Anyway, here's my overview of the album:    1.The Valley- Depeche Mode-like. Ok track.  2.Red Carpet Massacre- A rocker-like song with a \\"circus\\" beat popping up in between(??). Lyrics about the paparazzi. I wish this song could've been longer..  3.Nite Runner- Funky, upbeat dance song. Justin and Simon's voice blend beautifully together. Definitely single-worthy. One complaint: did we really need Timba-man? I found his contribution unnecessary.  4.Faling Down- Best song on the album. Reminds me of \\"Ordinary World.\\" Well done!  5.Box Full of Honey- Ok track.  6.Skin Divers- WORST SONG EVER. It had nothing to do with the music or the words. It was Timba-man's little \\"whicky,whicky,whicky\\" in the chorus that got on my nerves. Man, totally not gangsta.   7.Tempted- Sounds like \\"Sexy Back..\\"   8.Tricked out- An instrumental piece. To me,it sounded like something pulled off a Tim Burton movie. Honestly, we could've lived w/o it.   9.Zoom in- Forgettable. It's 3 minutes of listening to \\"noise.\\"   10.She's too much- Slow rock song. Why are we depending on machines to make the music when we have a REAL drummer?? Not a favorite.  11.Dirty Great Monster- Spooky, dark song, the way DD should be, yet has a disappointing end.   12.Last Man Standing- Boring, the hip-hop beats sound like that One Republic song that Timba-man produced, why can't you let Roger play, Mr. Hills? Such a selfish producer! Simon's melody was flawless, just take the music out and I'll be good from here.    Overall- O.K,4 stars-(1)It's Duran Duran,(2)Give them credit for trying,(3)Falling Down,(4)in hopes that may be I'll get my hands on that \\"Reportage\\" album. One star deduction due to the rapping and the production. Ick. Somebody thought it was cool to recycle music?! Ticky-drum production also ruined my listening experience. This is an album I'll only listen to once in a while in order to preserve its likeability.     Many of the dance songs sound too Timberlake-ish and nothing like Duran Duran. RCM also sounds rushed, flat, brief, and Simon's voice on \\"tempted\\" sounds like he's bored. If the guys only written some guitar parts, (eh hem) let Roger played, and cut the electronics by 80%, it might've been better. SOOO much better.    What was Timba-man thinking on \\"Skin Divers\\"?? It's chessy, asinine, and will get on your nerves after awhile. I thought Skin Divers was a joke. It's not single-quality.     By the way, haven't you noticed something odd about this album? From their debut album to Astronaut, everybody in the band contributed to writing the lyrics, so why is it only Simon who wrote the lyrics on RCM?    IF you want my honest opinion- buy the single for \\"Falling Down\\" and pass up on RCM, unless you're like me (the fan) who has to have all their albums. It's hit or miss. You like it or you don't. I found that most of RCM is forgettable.     Just such a disappointment after the awesome success of Astronaut. Just because you want to work with the hottest producers today doesn't mean you should.     Come back to the light, Duran Duran! Get Andy back and release \\"Reportage\\"! Also, ditch your current label (Epic), they suck.     **I look forward to the next release!**
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I went about seeing this series backwards...The movie Serenity came out (which is great) and once a friend told me it was based on the Firefly tv series I had to watch it.  She lent me her copy and I was hooked.  This is another great Joss Whedon show that is no longer on tv and I really wish it hadn't been cancelled.  I would love to see what would have happened if they had given it more of a chance.  If you love his shows you need to give this a try.  You won't regret it!
B0000026T4|4.0|Trash was the album that got me interested in Alice Cooper back in the late 80's. Tracks such as Poison , Bed of Nails and House of fire (one of my fave songs from Alice so far)where big hits back in the MTV rock era.As well as collaborations from Jon Bon Jovi and Steven Tyler any fanatic of late 80's music would get a kick out of Trash.You ask almost any casual Alice fan which song sticks in their mind and Poison would be their answer.My advice to anyone contemplating buying Trash......... Purchase Trash ,it is a fantastic rocker, but it is really not what Alice Cooper the solo artist is all about. Hey Stoopid and The last temptation showcase Alice at his best.

0439813786|5.0|Brian Selznick's pencil drawings offer a stunning tribute to the power of cinema, while slyly proving that the human hand has not lost its ability to thrill.  But if you have children you might want to stop reading with them at the end of Part One.  End there and you will have read the tale of an orphan's attempt to animate a clockwork human, bearing a fanciful and comforting message from the dead.  Proceeding to Part Two, however, the reader encounters the story of a real filmmaker and the rediscovery of his lost work.  True, this section contains some of the most stunning artwork, much of it directly inspired by the filmmaker Georges Melies, who was a sort of French Walt Disney whose innovations in special effects and technology made people think they were watching their dreams in the daytime.  But, for younger kids, this homage is apt to be about as interesting as an Orson Welles marathon on TCM, and only serves to spoil the magic trick done in Part One.  By the way, am I the only one who thought the film buff character of Etienne (French for Stephen ) looked just like a young Stephen Spielberg?  The Stern Librarian (I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.)
B000UBMWG4|5.0|What a great set. The only other set I could think of that comes close to this, is probably the 3 disc set of Criterion's \\"Seven Samurai\\". I have been waiting for a special edition of \\"Blade Runner\\" since the 20th anniversary which was 2002. When it didn't come out then, I thought will it ever?<br /><br />You will not be disappointed if you buy this Collector's Edition. 5 different versions spread across 3 discs. With the 2 other discs holding a 3 and half hour documentary on the making of \\"Blade Runner\\", and the other having footage no one has seen since shooting took place in 1981.<br /><br />This should be considered either blu-ray or dvd of the year for 2007. If you have a PS3, or a blu-ray player, you should really get this set. You will be enjoying it for years to come.<br /><br />\\"The light that burns twice as bright, burns for half as long, and you have burned so very, very brightly Roy.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|1995's \\"Persuasion\\" is a very solid dramatization of Jane Austen's last completed novel.  The movie opens with the abdication of French Emperor Napoleon in 1814.  The British Navy, long at sea, is \\"paid off\\", releasing its officers to find homes ashore.  An Admiral Croft rents the mansion of Sir Walter Elliot, a foppish baronet on the verge of bankruptcy.  Sir Walter moves his family to Bath, leaving behind his practical but much-put-upon daughter Anne to close out the house.  She will learn that Admiral Croft's brother in law is Captain Frederick Wentworth, once Anne's suitor, whom she was persuaded to reject on the grounds that he lacked money and status.  Anne is older now, still unmarried, and regretting her choice.<br /><br />Anne will visit with her sister before moving on to Bath. There, she will suffer through the awkwardness of meeting Wentworth again and of watching him pay court to two younger and prettier relatives.  An accident to one of them will force Anne to take charge, making a renewed impression on Wentworth.<br /><br />In Bath with her family, Anne will make a series of boring social rounds, only to have a long-missing Eliot cousin suddenly pay court to her.  This attention comes as Wentworth follows Anne to Bath; setting up a very interesting and very Jane Austen ending.  Director Roger Mitchell turns this love story into high suspense, investing each glance between Anne and Wentworth with emotional significance.  Jane Austen fans should not be disappointed; highly recommended.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I fell in love with this movie.  I know it is a chic flick. But some times we just need one of these. I thought it had just the right mix of humor and honesty. I can see these things really happening.<br /><br />I loved the idea that there was no bad language used, which shows that you don't have to use 4 letter words to make a point and a good movie. And also no nudes, again a good movie with out this needed. Yes a relationship was insinuated, but in good taste. It was a movie I felt comfortable watching with my 8 year old granddaughter next to me. Actually she enjoyed it to. She really liked the little girls, in fact we build a tent with stars hanging from the top when it was over. It was great!!
0060595183|4.0|This is a collection of two long essays by Aldous Huxley.  The First one featured is the Doors of Perception.  It argues that the primary purpose of the brain is to filter out irrelevant thought, rather than creating relevant thought.  This has somewhat been confirmed by modern neuroscience.  Through the use of hallucinogens one can remove the filtering mechanisms of the brain and explore new and uncharted areas of the brain.  The arguments are made clearly and compellingly.  For the doors of perception, I give 5-stars.    The Second Essay, Heaven and Hell, talks about using hallucinogens for the religious experience as a way of gaining insight.  His focus is specifically on Christianity.  I found these arguments to be less convincing.  To Heaven and Hell, I give 3-stars.    These essays played an important role in counter-culture, so they have historical significance.  They are also of significance to people searching for the psychedelic experience.

0743298039|4.0|This was a very engaging story. Written in the style of a Gothic novel, this story is very reminiscent of Jane Eyre, with a unique twist. The secret to the story is revealed to the reader as the main character figures it out, in a very realistic way.    What prevented this book from getting 5 stars was what I felt to be an unnecessary subplot that only served to bog the story down. I understand that our main character needed a \\"hook\\" of some kind to be convinced to write the biography she's been charged with writing, but I felt that Setterfield took the \\"ghost story\\" aspect of her lost twin too far.    That would not stop me from heartily recommending this book to anyone who likes Gothic novels.

B00005JPXY|3.0|Ever since we saw the teaser trailer for this film, \\"Cloverfield\\" has been something we've been waiting to see. More for curiosity then because the movie looked genuinely good, but hey, you have to admit that we haven't seen an advertising campaign like this in a long time. Imagine, an advertising campaign that made you WANT to see the movie! Gee, wonder why this movie did so well at the box office? Think Hollywood: What can we learn from this film? Anyway, despite all the hype and curiosity this film has garnered, it's not a great film. What it is is a great representation of the monster genre. A movie that targets a niche market, but is made well enough that it sheds some light on what the appeal to the genre is in the first place, and it doesn't make fans of the genre feel dumb for watching it.<br /><br />\\"Godzilla\\" this is not, and the movie is better off for it. What the producers did to make their film unique to know that we don't go to these movies to be intellectually involved, we go to be entertained. So out goes the story, out goes the motivations, and out goes the history of why the monster is created. There are only two things you need to know: The characters are having a going away party, and a monster starts attacking the town, therefor rudely interrupting the characters fun. There, what else do you need to know? I guess I could tell you that the movie is filmed from a digital camera, that shakes and wobbles as if the person holding the camera has never held a camera before. The result may make those with queasy stomachs nauseous with motion sickness, so you might want to keep that in mind before seeing this movie in a theater.<br /><br />If there is an annoyance to be had in the film, a real annoyance, then I think it would be the motivation. Basically, the main character decides he's going to go deep into the city and save his girlfriend. The rest of the friends, as well as the camera, follow him. At some point you'd think they'd give up after little monsters pop up, military response fails to prove effective, and the bridge falls down. When they actually get to the girlfriends apartment complex they find it leaning on another building, and the main character decides he's going to go up there anyway. I know the movie needs to reach an eighty minute point, but this quest seems more and more crazy the longer it goes on.<br /><br />Even though this is a monster movie, the characters should have enough sense to know that the likelihood of succeeding in this quest puts the whole team at risk for a cause that seems doomed from the start. Ah, but now I'm contradicting my own advice. There is very little reason to care about the story, only the action. And what action there is, well it's very effective. Very intense and very scary at times. This is a movie you'll want to see in a theater, for no other reason then for the audience participation.<br /><br />Rating: ***, military response fails to prove effective, and the bridge falls down.

B000OYC3J8|2.0|I am disapointed in this CD as a whole; it has it's moments but they're rare!
B000YA9R3C|3.0|P.T. Anderson is a director to keep an eye on. The man only has five films under his belt, but he's already proven that he has the talent and the ambition to be the next Martin Scoresese. It's been five years since his last film, \\"Punch Drunk Love,\\" was released, and you may remember that film as the first Adam Sandler vehicle that showed the former Saturday Night Live star had some serious depth and acting skills. Now Anderson is back, full of confidence and skill, with his new film \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" So confident is he, that he credits himself with his full name, Paul Thomas Anderson, which is most likely a deceleration to the world that he is ready to be a serious film maker. Instead of bringing out unusual depth from an actor people didn't think much of before though, Anderson is directing the one and only Daniel Day Lewis.<br /><br />Though Lewis is an acclaimed Academy Award winning actor, he only makes a movie once in a blue moon. That is, he only makes a movie if he likes the script. In this film, Lewis carries the film as an oil man named Daniel Plainview, a name that is one of the better in-jokes I've seen in a movie this year. Plainview is a successful oil tycoon who has open three successful drilling stations, and he heads to California to open a forth based on a tip from a young man name Paul (Paul Dano). When he gets to California oil is easily found, and the land is easily swindled from the families who own the land. Though easily taken, the one person who has reservations about Plainview is Eli Sunday (also played by Dano), who is an spiring pastor of a local church. He sold the land on the condition that Plainview would pay $5,000 to the church if the land produced oil, a fee Plainview doesn't exactly volunteer willingly.<br /><br />Then there is Plainviews son, H.W. Plainview, who is nothing more then an innocent face for Plainview to exploit at business pitches. Once the boy loses his hearing, Plainview's indifference to the boy is shocking and cruel. Of course, how can Plainview be expected to be anything but indifferent? He needed the boy as a political tool, not a sick boy who needs loving attention. Though not Anderson's best film to date, there are many signs as to why the director stills holds his position as a auteur artist. There are some great shots and cinematography in this movie. Much like another desert bound drama, \\"No Country For Old Men,\\" Anderson does what he can to make the desert a major character in the storyline. Though more occupied then in the aforementioned film, this film is also barren to a certain extent.<br /><br />We don't leave the oil rigs much, and so we get the sense that we are truly only involved in Plainviews own personal, enclosed world. It's just more happens in this particular world. A couple of oil accidents provide two of the most visually stunning scenes in the film. But credit due where credit is due, this movie lies on Daniel Day Lewis's gripping performance as Plainview. Though the story is light and a little fluffy, Plainview is an interesting character to watch from beginning to end. Really, the whole movie rests on this guy, as the storyline is a bit thin at times, though always interesting. That said, for such a thin storyline, the movie is two and a half hours, about thirty minutes longer then it needs to be.<br /><br />I've forgiven Anderson on the length of his films before, but I think the time has come to start editing the films better. People shouldn't be getting bored with climax's that feel drawn out to no real purpose. And while we're speaking of climaxes, the aesthetic ending this film has is a tad bit shocking to see. Though Anderson has never claimed whether he had any spiritual beliefs, it can't be denied that many of his films (particularly \\"Magnolia\\") contain strong spiritual themes, as well as spiritual characters that are portrayed (almost shockingly) as positive and influential people. To say that this new view caught me a little off guard is saying something. Still, overall this is a good film. It has it's problems with the pacing and ending, but it still is a good movie, and I find myself excited once more for Anderson's future projects.<br /><br />Rating: *** and 1/2 starsverall this is a good film.

B000UJ48UO|2.0|I was talking to a co-worker one time and we were talking about movies that left huge impressions on us visually. See, we couldn't agree on what could be considered \\"great writing\\" for a movie, so the conversation shifted to visuals, which should have been an easier conversation to have. It wasn't. His idea of a visually stunning movie was \\"The Fast and the Furious,\\" mainly because of how many explosions and cut-away editing tricks that were on display. He asked me what movies I felt were visually stimulating, and I gave him two names: Tim Burton and Stanley Kubrick. Though he was familiar with Burton, Kubrick's films were a mystery to him. I don't know why. Even if you haven't seen a Kubrick film, many of how movies have iconic images in them.<br /><br />I counted three in his Vietnam film \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\" Aside from those three images though, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is easily the most visually stunning Vietnam film I've ever seen. It is haunting to look at, and the tone of the film from the facial expressions, to the color, to the shadows create images that seem to drill right into your eyes, leaving them in your head for the rest of your life. That said, while \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" will evoke emotions from you for it's powerful imagery, the movie is, sadly, a shallow shell. The problem, I believe, comes in the fact that the movie never really establishes an emotional connection with the audience, even when the visuals do establish something. In fact, if I were to be fair, I'd go as far as to say this was actually two movies merged into one.<br /><br />The first half is the more story oriented of the two, but still confusing. At first we're under the impression that the protagonist of the movie is the cold-hearted Gunnery Sergeant Hartman ®. Lee Ermey), who takes up most of the first half hour of the film, barking orders and abusing the trainees. It's at this point though a kind soul, the overweight Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), who starts the film as a shy boy, but then slowly goes mad thanks to the humiliating training. During the second half of the film though, the movie drops these two stories and follows Joker (Matthew Modine), a fellow Marian trainee during the first half of the film, who's now been promoted to sergeant and is fighting in Vietnam. At this point any narrative the film attempted to establish before is lost.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about American soldiers killing innocent Vietnam families, side stories about how the soldiers horny needs aren't being met, and one of the strangest war scenes I've seen, where a film crew films a shoot out with the famous sixties song \\"Surfin Bird\\" playing in the background. The movie begins with a hopeless situation and go absolutely nowhere. It's an exercise in futility, where the only thing to see are people going mad. There are no characters to connect with, no larger story arc to follow, and no hidden meaning. Just a bunch of soldiers going crazy to the tune of odd songs and visual tricks. It looks stunning, but I found I just didn't care much at the end of the day.<br /><br />Rating: ** starsslowly goes mad thanks to the humiliating training.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|great movie !  I was surprised because it didn`t do so good at the box office.   It really is a very good movie
B000UJ48WC|4.0|Though me and my mom normally share various points of views on certain film makers, we tend to split when it comes to Stanley Kubrick. My mom says, \\"he's so weird.\\" I tell her \\"yeah, but he's a brilliant film maker, who films visually stunning films that are also mesmerizing.\\" To this she just shrugs and says, \\"I don't care, he's still weird.\\" Though a big fan of the director, for some reason his 80's horror film, \\"The Shining,\\" escaped me for the longest time. Based off the best selling book by Stephen King, \\"The Shining\\" is one of the Kubricks masterpieces. Yeah, yeah, I know for many people every movie the man made was a masterpiece, but this is one of those rare occurrences where art and entertainment collide so spectacularly, it almost feels accidental.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson, in one of his best roles), a struggling writer who is having a bad case of writers block. He is a recovering alcoholic who lost his teaching job due to his short temper, so he interviews for a job as a caretaker of a hotel that closes it's doors during the winter season. Jack gets the job, and moves his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel for the winter. Before letting them into the building though, the manager warns them that due to the months of insolation, they are likely to experience Cabin Fever. One caretaker apparently suffered this and ended up killing his wife and two daughters. Jack thanks the man for the warning, but takes the job anyway. It's a shame Jack didn't know he was part of a Stephen King story, he most likely would have passed on the job.<br /><br />What follows is nothing short of a full decent into madness. Though this is a horror film, and the movie is indeed very scary, Kubrick is a good enough storyteller that he knows how to properly build the suspense. At first little happens in the house. Wendy and Danny explore all the various rooms in the house, while Jack tried to write a novel. When that fails, Jack simply wastes time by bouncing a tennis ball against the wall. Once the snow starts though, things get bumpy. Jack becomes more and more agitated, Wendy becomes more scared of her husband. Most telling though is Danny, who earlier in the film talked to a friend who lived in his finger named Tommy, and how it appears Tommy wants out, making Danny say \\"Redrum\\"over, and over again.<br /><br />Either Danny is also going crazy, or there's more to Redrum then initially meets the eye. Though all these developments may sound corny on paper, the truth is they are built up very slowly. For the first two hours we follow a pleasant family around in this big house. Then, as Jack becomes more delusional and Danny more crazy, things start to unfold. If this movie was made today, Jack would become crazy and start killing off a group of stupid teenagers for two hours. Instead, Jack starts talking to ghosts. Then he starts shouting at his wife. Then we feel he is a threat to his family. When the violence finally hits at the end of the film it hits hard. It even features an image of Jack Nicholson that has become iconic.<br /><br />What makes the violence the payoff is that we work our way towards it. The movie is not senseless violent, and its more about fear then killing. A twist at the end will make you question and rethink the whole experience of the movie, much in the same way the ending of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" forced a re-evaluation of that film. This is not a bad thing, but a good thing. This means that the film is about something. It's here to make you think. That you are entertained is a blessing, but the images, the words, and the silence are all working towards provoking certain feelings from you, and the story is deeper and more complicated then you might think at first. \\"The Shining\\" offers well thought out thrills, a complicated story, and a memorable ending. It truly is a classic.<br /><br />Rating: **** starsck simply wastes time by bouncing a tennis ball against the wall. Once the snow starts though, things get bumpy.

That you are entertained is a blessing, but the images, the words, and the silence are all working towards provoking certain feelings from you, and the story is deeper and more complicated then you might think at first. \\"The Shining\\" offers well thought out thrills, a complicated story, and a memorable ending. It truly is a classic.    Rating: **** stars
0143113100|5.0|Found the book to be very helpful & informative.  I just happen to stumble (no pun intended) across this book via the internet search.  The first story is nearing my life & talking with \\"Western\\" doctors about Neuroplasticity is an option most are floored that I am even aware of. Most will disregard until I remind them of my 11 years of struggling & all the drugs & surgies suggested to date which have not worked. Unfortunately, non-covered by my insurance, I must pay out of pocket but at this point, between all the co-pays from the pharmacies, providers & facilites, I wonder if I still would have saved money? Jeez pharmacies, doctors & facilities do not make a dime from it, I wonder why they are struggling with this concept?
B0000549B0|5.0|I saw this film initially as a child, but all these years later, I now realize the importance of being \\"pleasant,\\" as Elwood Dowd, friend to all, states.<br /><br />Not just a funny, enjoyable family film -- but a wonderful positive reinforcement of the childlike (not childish!) approach to life that would keep us all sane, if we only give it a chance.<br /><br />Highly recommeded to all who suspect we've got friends that others might not see. Charming!

B00005JL0I|2.0|Oh, the pain, the pain of the first 45 minutes and the last 25 of the 1967 epic spoof version of Casino Royale, which try too very hard to be wacky and with it and funny to be anything other than execrable. Two or three jokes sort of work, but probably only because you're desperate for something, anything to work - and then suddenly the Peter Sellers-Joanna Pettet sections kick in and suddenly the film seems almost good. It even starts to look like a real movie instead of an over-decorated Christmas tree, with a particularly stunning bit of slo-mo in the Look of Love scene, and some genuine wit in Q's scene, set in the basement of Harrods. It's a shame that Sellers walked off the picture, because the gaps are often all-too visible and horribly papered over. And then, after an hour of not bad, Sellers is gone and it suddenly goes straight back to overproduced Hell for a painful and redundant finale. Still, at least Burt Bacharach's score is a lot of fun and a joy to listen to: if only it graced a worthier film.     The US NTSC disc includes the 1954 live TV version of Casino Royale, with an uncomfortable Barry Nelson as Jimmy Bond of the CIA, Michael Pate a wildly unconvincing Leiter of British Intelligence, don't ya know, and a very good Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The plot is boiled down to a 50-minute running time but it's not without interest and while it may spare Bond the carpet beater it doesn't completely cop out on the torture scene. However, it's worth noting that a special edition DVD with a new documentary on the 1967 version will be released in the future.
B000G6BM00|5.0|The movie was great. I ordered this from Amazon so I knew it would be a great product and be here in 2 days.
B000LY4KWO|5.0|After six years in limbo as EON and the new owners of MGM/UA found themselves and the series locked in legal action at lawsuits, Timothy Dalton decided too much time had elapsed to renew his licence to kill, ushering in the Brosnan era. At the time hailed for `saving' the series (just as Dalton and Moore had been before him), the star's own bitter feud with the producers and the success of Daniel Craig in reinventing the role seem to have combined with disappointment with some of Brosnan's subsequent Bond films to the point where it's harder and harder to find any Bond fans with a good word to say about his tenure. But in 1995 GoldenEye was certainly welcomed with open arms and blockbuster business and it holds up remarkably well.     If there's a problem with Brosnan's take on Bond, it's that there really isn't much of one. He looks good in the suits, does what's required but where every other Bond actor brought something new or of their own to the part, Brosnan is more of a composite of previous Bonds, an across-the-board demographic-pleasing but nothing radical Bond, veering more towards the unflappable suavity of Roger Moore than the danger of Connery or Lazenby or the gritty bleakness of Dalton. But then, if Brosnan brings nothing new but his face to the part, in many ways, like The Living Daylights, GoldenEye is a kind of transitional Bond film rather than anything as radical as Casino Royale, the old Bond formula recognisably in place with all the surface gloss and expected ingredients but with a post-Cold War spin to dust off some of the more clichéd aspects.     While the plot isn't exactly realistic, revolving around a scheme to use a stolen Russian electromagnetic pulse satellite weapon to wreak a lucrative revenge for past wrongs done to the villain's family, the treatment isn't as over the top or as arch as it could have been (for that, you need to see Brosnan's final outing, Die Another Day). The writing is much stronger than usual, the film plot-ledand finding a good mix between the action you expect and some insights into the characters you don't, for the first time in the series' history the leading ladies really do have decent roles, and Martin Campbell's direction is particularly powerful: while it is a little short on long shots, betraying his TV background, it's got none of that going-through-the-motions feel to many of the more prolific Bond directors' efforts. Terry Rawlings' editing is also interesting and often highly effective, while even Eric Serra's much criticised score - that hideous post-title sequence car chase aside - is often stronger than it's given credit for even if it is perhaps too giant a leap from the traditional Bond sound for most purists.     If the film is still highly enjoyable, the Ultimate Edition DVD, however, is a definite mixed blessing. The new extras are particularly good - 4 deleted scenes and several new featurettes, including ones on the tank chase, car stunts, model work, pre-production, location scouting and Campbell's directing (which much footage of him in a bad mood on a particularly bad day). There's also the press conference introducing Brosnan, the original TV promo `GoldenEye - The Secret Files' and all the extras from the original release (though curiously the extra TV spot from the laserdisc release is still is missing). All of which SHOULD make this a perfect disc - with one notable caveat. Unfortunately the new transfer is not, with the picture wildly overcropped - it's still in the 2.35:1 ratio, but top, bottom and both sides have been cropped, which is very noticeable on the computer readouts in the film. For that reason, if you aren't bothered about the extras you might want to stick with the previous special edition, which IS in the right ratio.

Our daily \\"Blokus breaks\\" are a hit with my 3,4, and 8 year old.  It is a lot of fun and I love seeing my young kids figure out strategy and enjoy the learning that goes along with it.

B000035P5E|3.0|For some strange reason, Donald Sutherland has presided over the end of several of cinema's previously sure things - the Alistair Maclean thriller (Bear Island), Neil Simon comedies (Max Dugan Returns), Agatha Christie adaptations (Ordeal by Innocence) and, with Eye of the Needle, the WW2 romantic thriller. After frequent demonstrations of his adeptness with a switchblade, his top nazi spy `The Needle' and his bad English accent are shipwrecked on Storm Island, where Kate Nelligan lives with her crippled husband Christopher Cazenove and their badly dubbed child. While Ian Bannen fritters away on the mainland in lukewarm pursuit before his prey can get away with D-Day secrets, the two leads start an affair before things turn nasty. You'd have thought that after the last time Nelligan played a girl called Lucy who rescued a near-drowned stranger turned out (in 1979's Dracula) she'd have learned her lesson...     Miklos Rozsa delivers a vividly romantic score that is both full of overpowering dramatic drive and in completely the wrong picture (it works better on disc) while Richard Marquand's merely functional direction, wildly overrated at the time because the news had just leaked out that he'd been signed to direct Return of the Jedi (`so he must be good' as one critic profoundly put it before finding out what a botched job he made of that assignment), fails to elevate the picture. The result is one of those films you really want to like much more than it'll let you, entertaining enough but still somewhat disappointingly average. The unimpressive non-anamorphic widescreen transfer that's particularly poor on flesh tones and has a few wobbles and a horribly botched end title that has the score laid on twice out of synchronisation (so you can hear the middle of the cue playing at the same time as the beginning, making for a confused cacophony) on the English soundtrack doesn't help.     The laserdisc release included an alternate ending (barely different from the one used) that's missing from the DVD, although the UK disc does restore the original censor trims to avoid an X certificate - but be warned, it's a mere six seconds of footage! The only extra here is the US trailer which goes to great lengths to hide the fact that the Needle is a spy and the film is set in WW2, instead pitching it as a slasher movie!
B001041JLE|5.0|Lol okay so this would be my...what?155'th time I've listened to this album since I was 3 years old?How many other billion people can say that?Well ask the Guiness Book Of World Records because I AM TALKING ABOUT THE MUSIC HERE!!!!With this deluxe set you get a nice brass-bound package with a booklet and a DVD with the three Thriller videos and Michael's performance on Motown 25. The liner book,as on so many reissues basically emphasizes how huge this album was in the early to mid 1980's.NOW down to the music.After the original album you get five new \\"remixes\\" which have been hyped to death,even if they weren't the main reason for me purchasing this album a second time on CD. For the most part these remixes are kind of Black Eyed Peas oriented,as two members contribute three of the remakes.My personal favorite is Fergie's take on \\"Beat It\\". Will I.AM does a very creative take on \\"PYT\\",using an element of what I assume is that famous elongated version of the song Quincy Jones had whittled off in 1982.My two least favorites were Akon's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and Kayne West's \\"Billy Jean\\";Kayne's signiture slowed down beat doesn't mesh well with the song he chooses and the production is too bassy even for modern hip-hop-another Kayne trait.Akon's cut is simply embarrassing;he himself is a fun entertainer but not that original and,to be kind his voice is extrodinarily weak.But the young people tend to like him,even so his voice pitted against MJ's show just how truely inferior a vocalist Akon can be. One of the main features for me getting this is the unrealesed \\"For All Time\\". This song is a very poppy ballad even for an album like this and,since the one thing that makes this album unique is how it perfectly blends slick funk with glossy pop. It's a good song though and I only wish some type of \\"Complete Thriller Sessions\\" boxed set of some kind was released;there are a huge number of songs recorded but never released for these sessions. Sadly big record labels reserve that kind of treatment for jazz and rock mostly;R&B artists never seem to get \\"complete session\\"-type boxed sets. And when eyeballing the massive vaults of Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson here I know they have a lot of unrealesed material that is commercially and artistically viable. But that doesn't mean by any measure I am not glad to see this album out again and that todays entertainers find Michael,despite him being (at best)a terrible role model in his personal life today was and is an amazing musical talent.And when you have that kind of ability that is something that can never fade.ls reserve that kind of treatment for jazz and rock mostly;R&B artists never seem to get \\"complete session\\"-type boxed sets.

B000WWSGHA|5.0|As one of the only 12 people who was genuinely delighted at Daniel Craig's casting a year ago, I must admit I was more than a little worried about Casino Royale. Not the kind of paranoia that those newcomers who'd never experience the changing of the guard the series goes through every decade or the staggeringly venomous hate-mongering of the more fanatical Brosnan fans who felt compelled to start libellous hate-sites, though. After all those months of arguing that he was the perfect choice for the role (especially after some of the more moronic suggestions), was I setting myself up for a fall if he turned in a disappointing performance? Similarly there was the film itself. While the producers were making all the right noises about going back to basics, they'd done exactly the same with Licence To Kill and chickened out to deliver a sub-Roger Moore effort with Wayne Newton as a comedy relief villain, inept ninjas, pointless gadgets, laughable violence and monster truck stunts. Too often in the past the franchise had been over-reliant on the goodwill generated by the earlier films, rehashing earlier vehicles to decreasing returns secure in the knowledge that the audience would turn up anyway. Take away the Bond brand, and too many post-OHMSS entries simply wouldn't have stood up to scrutiny in the marketplace on their own merits: Bond had become a tradition, a ritual like going home for the holidays that you knew was never going to be as good as it was when you were a kid but which you still went through out of a mixture of hope and obligation.     I needn't have worried. Not only is it the best Bond film in 37 years, it's as if the Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan years never happened. After Brosnan's surprisingly lazy and slightly seedy turn in DAD, Craig delivers the most physical Bond since Lazenby, but this time matched by the acting chops to make the most of the best script the series has had in decades - at once plot and character led - as the rookie blunt instrument bulldozes his way through his mission until emotional awakening and betrayal starts to finesse him into the Bond we knew from the Connery days. Brosnan never could have delivered this kind of performance, either physically or emotionally, and, truth be told, neither could Connery in his prime: Craig is the first one to convince you that he's not a movie star or an actor but that he really IS James Bond.     The updating of the plot from the Cold War era to a post 9/11 world works surprisingly well, with the first act managing to provide a convincing motive for the high stakes poker game centrepiece while also providing a couple of superb action scenes that don't become too absurd and serve the plot in a series where in the past the plot was too often an excuse for the action. The much-criticised change from baccarat to poker is a smart one too. Where Baccarat is purely a game of luck (as Fleming himself found out when he went bust in three hands trying out the novel's premise on a Nazi spy), poker actually involves both strategy and psychology, making for more satisfying drama and tension.     There is, sadly, one concession to gadgetry that veers into the absurd - c'mon, who keeps a defibrillator in their glove compartment? - and is an unwelcome reminder of the days when old Roge would get out of a scrape with his buzz saw wristwatch or his projectile dart cufflinks thanks to lazy writing, but elsewhere it settles for using existing technology (most of it manufactured by Sony for some reason that escapes me) rather than veering into total fantasy. And it's good to see a Bond who needs hospitalisation after the villain goes Quasimodo on his nuts with a bell rope. The film's final sequence promises one helluva follow-up, and one can only hope the producers don't lose their nerve and throw it all away the way they did with Diamonds Are Forever. The real James Bond is indeed back.     Extras-wise the 2-disc DVD is a disappointment by the standards of the previousEON entries, although there is reportedly a more elaborate special edition planned in the future.
0739474812|4.0|Very nice mystery set in England. A bit slow in parts but a great story! Mystery story, love story and a bit of a thriller all in one.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|At once the victim of impossible expectations after years of false starts and rumors about Connery's return to Bondage and also a breath of fresh air as the Roger Moore Bond films increasingly floundered, Never Say Never Again was a welcome riposte to the worst excesses of the EON franchise in 1983, but time hasn't been that kind to it. There are certainly some horrible miscalculations, Carrera's cartoonish villainess Fatima Blush (like Faye Dunaway on steroids), Edward Fox's self-parody as M, Pamela Salem's moronic Moneypenny and an embarrassingly over-the-top Rowan Atkinson's horribly unfunny Nigel Small-Fawcett among them, not to mention that problematic and much-despised easy listening score from Michel Legrand.     A famously troubled production, with Cubby Broccoli frightening studios, investors and co-stars away through years of lawsuits and Connery taking against the film's inexperienced producer Jack Schwartzman so violently that he would reportedly hide whenever the actor came anywhere near his office, most of the scars aren't visible in the finished product. Thankfully the worst excesses of the legendary unfilmed but sadly rather silly and OTT script Connery and Len Deighton penned in the early 70s, Warhead (which climaxed with a hang-glider attack on the Statue of Liberty and boasted a villain with his own underwater lair), were also toned down, albeit largely for budget reasons. With only a watered-down version of their radio-controlled sharks remaining, this version is at least a little more grounded than the rampant silliness that had seen the Bonds stray unrecognisably far from their roots in Ian Fleming's novels. Despite uncredited co-writers Ian La Fresnais and Dick Clements pilfering their earlier movie spinoff of Porridge for some of the jokes, the more streamlined screenplay flows better than Thunderball, which was always the clunkiest of Bond scripts in its desperation to throw everything including the kitchen sink into the mix, but it's also less fun. Odder still is the very American feel to the film, with a clean, spare look that's uncomfortably at odds with Connery's previous outings.     On the plus side, Klaus Maria Brandauer is particularly good as Largo, Bernie Casey brings an easy familiarity to his role that makes him one of the best of the many Felix Leiters in Connery's tenure, and Alec McCowen and Max Von Sydow are fine in undemanding parts while Robert Rietty, who voiced Largo in Thunderball as well as numerous other Bond characters over the years, turns up briefly onscreen for a change. It's also thankfully light on the gadgets that got particularly out of control in the EON series during the 80s and the action scenes are for the most part well-handled, with an excellent fight with Pat Roach the standout despite a particularly lame gag ending.     Enjoyable but no enduring classic. It's worth noting that a special edition of this title will also be released some time in the future.
B00116FT6M|5.0|No problems at all with the quality of the DVD and the movie was a hoot.  I personally didn't care for John Travolta's portrayal, but that's just me.
6304696558|4.0|The service comedy is a genre almost as old as cinema itself and, whether it's Charlie Chaplin or Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe in the trenches, Andy Griffith befuddling his sergeants, the Carry On team on the assault course or Steve Guttenberg and co at the Police Academy, has an almost immutable formula that is never, ever departed from: through mildly comic misadventure misfit(s) find themselves in the army/navy/air force/police force, are hopelessly unprepared for the harsh realities of basic training, fumble every task yet somehow come out of it all as the perfect soldier/sailor/airman/cop and prove themselves in a mildly comic baptism of fire. Private Benjamin does absolutely nothing to fix what ain't broke, contenting itself to offer the odd slight tweak and flavoring with a mild dose of Jewish humor as Goldie Hawn's sheltered princess finds herself talked into joining the `new' army by Harry Dean Stanton's smooth-talking recruiting sergeant after husband Albert Brooks dies in the throes of passion before the honeymoon even starts (\\"Do you remember what the last thing he said was?\\" asks his distraught mother, eliciting the reply \\"I'm coming.\\").     While it's a given that there are no surprises whatsoever, it's one of those comedies that manages to be pretty consistently funny throughout even if there aren't many really big laughs out of sheer likeability. Hawn's character is not too bright but not too Hilton with it - her character arc is not just from dependence to self-reliance but more importantly from not being able to understand why Jill Clayburgh walked out on Alan Bates in An Unmarried Woman to being able to make the same choice herself, in the process tackling sexism rather more effectively than G.I. Jane did 17 years later. Eileen Brennan is clearly having a ball as the obligatory sadistic training officer out to make her life hell and there's a quietly impressive supporting cast filling out the ranks as well as a memorable Bill Conti score. It only really misses its step slightly in the scenes where her Monsieur Right (Armand Assante) rather clumsily turns out to be Monsieur Wrong at the end, as if afraid of losing the audience's sympathy long after she's won them over, but not enough to squander the goodwill it's earned by then.
B000VNMMWA|4.0|A big \\"Yarrp\\" to the very English action movie Hot Fuzz. No, it's not as good as Shaun of the Dead, but it's not really a disappointment either even if the laugh count is a lot lower. Much of the film really isn't that funny, yet it gets by for much of its running time on sheer enthusiastic likeability. At times Edgar Wright's direction tries a little too hard and few of the many cameos have much to do (though a heavily disguised Cate Banchett makes a real virtue of her anonymity and Peter Jackson does turn up as a psycho Santa), but it's one of the very few films where the fun that the filmmakers seem to be having actually seems to translate to the finished product. As with Shaun, it's an inspired bit of gene-splicing, in this case a wonderful yet surprisingly logical cross between Agatha Christie and Jerry Bruckheimer, with a series of very English crimes - motivated by nothing so sordid as monetary gain or as logical as a criminal conspiracy but rather by something infinitely more respectable - culminating in 20 minutes of virtuoso mayhem that sees Simon Pegg and Nick Frost shooting up the kind of quaint and picturesque village more used to the genteel Sunday teatime likes of The Vicar of Dibley and All Creatures Great and Small. Even the casting of the local Neighbourhood Watch is truly inspired, consisting of (among others), James Bond (Timothy Dalton, whose `supermarket slasher' gets my vote for Best Supporting Actor this year), Callan (Edward Woodward), Bellocq from Raiders of the Lost Ark (Paul Freeman), the nanny from The Omen (Billie Whitelaw) and the villain from Lethal Weapon 3 (Stuart Wilson). And there's been some real thought put into the disposal of the bad guys, which mirror the various murders in gruesomely exaggerated fashion via bear traps, model villages and sea mines. Very pleasing indeed - even the extras on the DVD are unusually entertaining. Yarrp.

B000LY5QQS|2.0|The history of the latter Bond films is one of false dawns, with sporadic good or near-great Bond films promptly followed by horribly disappointing ones. OHMSS was followed by the lazy Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me by Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only by Octopussy, and sadly Pierce Brosnan's enjoyable Bond debut GoldenEye remained true to form in being followed by another clunker. Tomorrow Never Dies was a famously troubled shoot, with a constantly rewritten unfinished script the most visible of its many problems. It's that classic `inbetween good Bonds' film that just feels like its treading water while they recharge their creative batteries for the next one. The premise may sound absurd - Jonathan Pryce's media mogul tries to start a war in Asia to boost circulation and viewing figures in return for local TV concessions - but it's a scam that William Randolph Hearst pulled for real in the Spanish-American War with his infamous telegram to a reporter \\"You supply the pictures and I'll supply the war.\\" True, he didn't use a Stealth Ship or a guided drill-torpedo to do it, but the film almost pulls it off as a framework for a Bond movie. The problem is that, aside from David Arnold's excellent score, not much else really works.     Pryce isn't exactly a threatening supervillain and his henchmen are a rather bland bunch with the exception of Vincent Schiavelli's master assassin, who opts for broad overacting rather than menace. It may be an inspired idea to cast Michelle Yeoh as the leading lady, but with only one brief fight it seems rather pointless hiring one of the best action stars in the world if she doesn't get to do much. Worse, the action scenes are distinctly hit-and-miss. The pretitle sequence is terrific and the remote-controlled car chase one of the more enjoyable gadget showcases, but somehow the motorbike vs. helicopter chase through the streets and rooftops of Saigon never works nearly as well as it should: the footage is good but there's something almost haphazard about the editing that robs it of much of its potential. The film's big finale is little short of disastrous. Reputedly intended to be on a larger scale but scaled down because the effects shots wouldn't be ready in time for the film's opening date, there's literally nothing at stake by this point - with WW3 safely averted, all that's left for a somewhat bored Bond to do is walk around a badly designed and unappealingly photographed set shooting extras like he was in a bad video game before killing an old man with glasses.     Throw in lazy plotting and some of the worst dialogue in the series history and even the few promising ideas thrown up along the way tend to get lost in the hurry to get something releasable in the can. While Die Another Day is most Bond fans' choice for Brosnan's worst Bond, that at least threw up some good ideas in the first half - this feels like a film where no-one had a decent idea between them but were contractually obliged to deliver a movie in time for Christmas anyway. Horribly disappointing.     There's not a great deal of in the way of new extras to justify an upgrade if you have the previous special edition - aside from the extras carried over from that, there's a featurette on Moby's Bond theme remix, some redundant clips from the movie and some weak deleted scenes. Among them is an extended briefing scene in M's car where everyone is drinking cocktails that is so clumsily executed (every shot ends with them raising a glass to their lips) that it looks like an outtake from the old Thunderbirds TV series, so the film could clearly have been even worse, but that's scant consolation. As per all of the Brosnan Bond DVDs, there's no proper making of documentary either, just the odd puff-piece from its first release. One for the bond completists only, really.

1573228737|4.0|When I finally learned how to read at the late ago of seven I stopped seeing words as a series of letters and started seeing pictures instead. Not just the picture one word projected or one sentence, but the whole book. I started reading books as though they were movies and so learned to read faster because I was so immersed in the atmosphere of the book.     Atmosphere has always been the most important part of the book to me. If I can't really believe my surroundings while I'm reading then the book just isn't worth finishing.    From the very first page of this book I heard creepy piano music, saw dim lights that were almost depressing and a lot of the color gray. This may not seem like an atmosphere you'd want to spend 350+ pages in, but it fit the story so well that I was just lost in the book. The author's power of description was perfect and made reading this book a true experience.    \\"Affinity\\" is told in two parts, a narrative in diary form set about a year in the past from the main story from the point of view of Selina Dawes, a young spiritualist in 1870's London arrested for assault and fraud and a diary by Margaret Prior a wealthy spinster who has become a lady visitor at a prison to take her mind off some mystery shrouded event in her life.. The two alternate-Selina with extremely vague and short entries that leave you wondering if she has spiritual powers or is just a clever fraud and Michelle detailing everything that happens in her unhappy home life and her obsessive visits to Milbank prison. The two together bring forth at atmosphere of grayness, misunderstanding and silence, weather imposed by prison guards or polite society. Truly they do so seem to have an affinity to them.     But as the book progresses and we learn more of Selina and Margaret strange things start to happen. Items disappear from Margaret's bedroom and Selina says that the sprits took them-and on top of that she knows things Margaret could have never told her. A sort of link develops between the two leading to their final plan and the revelation that changes everything.    I liked this book a lot and was very surprised by the turns and twists its story took. That atmosphere as I've said was excellent and really did its job of transporting the reader into the story. But for some reason the story didn't call out to me so while I did like this book I didn't love it.     Four stars
B000E5KJFM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, It has some political overtones and dramatic action that combine to give a story relevant to modern times! whether the pretense of the film is true or near true to the reality of the mid east and western involvement is up to you to decide but regardless this portrayal should at least allow you to consider its perspective! the HD DVD transfer is good and is a good improvement over the SD version. Compared to other HD movies it falls in the middle of picture quality as do imho a majority of films where the video and audio tracks are not meant to stun you, but rather  just involve you in the story!
B000002LQD|5.0|I think all the negative reviews for this masterpiece are from people who have (a) never had to lose somebody to death/cancer, or (b) lost somebody, but haven't been able to face up to it yet.    This CD, for me, is catharsis on a very deep level. I can't listen to it very often, but when I can, it helps me work through the many losses I've already gone through.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|Awesome flick and one of the best HD transfers of any format!!!!! prepare to be amazed! A friend of mine that didn't like this move sat through it with me after seeing and hearing the stunning presentation hd dvd does with this title!
B0002IQEHI|5.0|This is one of my favorate movies!  Cary Grant is classic in his part as a man who has been a victim of mistaken identity.  The movie also gives you a nostalgic look into the late 1950's to the early 1960's.    Be careful when buy though!  I bought three brand new copies that all had defects in the same places!  Had to finally get a used copy.
0142410373|5.0|This is a really cute book (that I see has recently been made into a movie).  Matilda is a smart girl that likes to read, who has a car salesman father that sells cars he illegally fixes up (like putting on a fender with glue).  Her parents would prefer her to watch tv than read.  Then the adventures start when she goes to school.  Its a quick read and very entertaining.
B0000019PA|5.0|I'm not going to waste my time describing this album as many have already done.  Basically, if you don't own this album--get it--it will probably change your life.  This is an absolutely timeless album by a band to whom scores of newer bands are eternally indebted (cough--The Decemberists--cough).  These days it's nearly impossible to be truly innovative as a band, and NMH gets about as close as one can.  You really owe it to yourself to get this album, and you should really own \\"On Avery Island\\" as well.
B000AYELVA|5.0|Of the three X-Men movies, this is my favorite.  At the time of its release, it was fresh, new and ground breaking with its action scenes and special effects.  The story line also stayed true to the comic book (somewhat), which is very rare in comic book adaptations.  Don't watch the follow-up films until you watch the first one.  It really is the jump-on point.  Both comic book enthusiasts and non-comic book readers alike will like this film.    Highly recommended flick in my book.  Check it out.
6301966562|4.0|Oh, my goodness, I hope they have a DVD for this movie soon.  My sister and I really enjoyed watching this movie and the soundtrack was fun too!  I liked Virginia Madsen in this and sometimes when I read her bios, they forget to mention she even made this movie.  Not fair!  It was nothing to be embarrassed about.  I agree with most of the other customers' reviews.  Please get it on DVD soon!  For now, just like the other customer, the soundtrack will have to do.  Or I will have to go and buy me a new VHS tape player!  :-)  For those of you who have not watched it yet, go do it!
B00003CWLF|5.0|This was a good purchase.  I wanted to see it to compare to the King and I. I like it. High quality it came in a reasonable time span.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled has done it again! I thought that it couldn't get any better after the Kite Runner but I was wrong! His skill for writting is simply wonderful. You can't help but to feel as if you know each character personally. It also gives you a window by which you can view how people live in Afghanistan(It's not at all like how the media portrays it). If you read this book you will absolutley love it, I garantee it!
B00008972S|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Another childhood favorite and so I had to have it. It has the full script included. That was fun to read through.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|This movie is an excellent blu-ray transfer; very crisp,clear and the colors were excellent. Pixar did a great job.
B000UBMZ4S|4.0|This is outstanding hd dvd, the picture is from 1978 so you cannot expect perfect picter still it is very good bat most importent the sound it is outstanding, the miusci of vangelis and the sound of the movie is perfect, it make such extra climat when you watch this, so you feel like be there i n the middle of action, perfect purchase for me and you have 3 version of hd dvd movie, ich diferent than others  recomended
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I like many other avid Austen fans was thrilled to see that a new version of Persuasion was to air on the local PBS channel.  Although the PBS version was edited, I doubt that anything could truly save this movie.  Outside of the beautiful scenery and music, this version lacked all the charm of the 1995 movie with Hinds and Root.  It was so greatly altered from the book, the story was almost unrecognizable.  It was a tremendous disappointment.
B000FGG60W|4.0|Hello i buy this product in december,its worth eny cent, picture is crisp detalic and very sharp i have regular dvd wersion and this is much much better,the sound is very good also but i cant notize is it better then on regular dvd, if you like this film you must have.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I had known of Sarah McLachlan but never took any notice of her until a friend's funeral in which 'Angel'(studio version) was played.  The next day I sought out McLachlan's CDs and luckily came across 'Mirrorball', discounted to $9.99 at JB Hi-Fi(Australian equivalent of Best Buy).  What stood out immediately was the superb production.  Every instrument came through with clarity and (pardon the inarticulateness)'oomph!'  I found myself listening to music that I'd never thought I'd ever like.  'Building a Mystery',Hold On' and 'Good Enough' is a brilliant opening hat-trick and drew me into the record instantly.  Even the standard(for Sarah) 'I Will Remember You','Adia & 'I Love You' didn't get me to press the fast-forward on my player.  The second half is just a touch superior to the first.  The exhilrating 'The Path of Thorns', the starkness of 'Fear' and the desperate 'Posession' is another sublime three-in-a-row.  The (almost) bubble-gum popness of 'Sweet Surrender' and 'Ice Cream' are pleasant entrees for the final two songs.  This version of 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy' is the best I have heard from any of Sarah's other recordings of it.  The smouldering build-up,Sarah's passionate delivery of \\"If I shed a tear I won't cage it, I won't fear love\\",the high notes she hits just before Sinclair or Ashby (help me out McLachlan diehards!)launches into an electrifying (blues?) solo which gives even my goosebumps goosebumps.  In a fitting final song, Sarah nails 'Angel' perfectly. Better than the studio version. I can see why it is commonly played at funerals.  Magnificent.  I just want to address a few criticisms of the cd from other reviewers.  Fade outs in-between songs is a tad off putting, but for me it doesn't detract from the recording, but I can understand other points of view.  I like the production but I can understand that people, who have been fans of Sarah longer than me, don't like how some songs sound too produced.  Finally for the reviewer who gave it onestar after Sarah drops the f-word in 'Building a Mystery'.  You are a very small,sad little person if you let one word get in your way of enjoying a wonderful recording.Your loss.  This record has found its way back into my CD player(along with '10,000 Days' & ' Black Holes & Revelations') consistantly since April 2007.   I have subsequently bought every Sarah CD & DVD and now (shockingly & humbly) find myself a die hard fan.
B00005JPXY|2.0|This film would have been quite enjoyable if not for the cliched jerky spinning hand held camera gimmick that made us all sick in Blair Witch...it's really over the top in this movie and why arent we seeing films shot during the day....it wudda been just as scary especially the scene in the subway tunnel!!

B000RZIGVS|4.0|The series is great, but the packaging of the box set SUCKS bad.  It is SO complicated to get the movies out if it is all put together.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|Incredible mindless action. Fun to watch from start to finish. Guns, violence and Monica Belucci, what more can you ask for?  Popcorn entertainment at its best.
B00002428O|5.0|i first heard this album in 1988. i was 16 and i had never heard anything like it... This is DCD at their unique best. Its also one of the most coherent and focused of their albums, almost a summing up of the previous 2 albums and EP. The darkness of those earlier recordings focused to produce a stunning virtuoso work... 20 years later i still havnt heard anything to equal it.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I've always been a mild fan of Bruce. Saw him in concert and have a few of his albums. I prefer his older material, \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\", than \\"Born In the USA\\". It's been awhile since anything new from Bruce resonated with me. I happen to hear the song \\"Radio Nowhere\\" on the radio, and I said, wow, is that new Springsteen? It had a great gritty rock n roll sound to it. My girlfriend went out and bought the album, and I took a listen. No sooner did I start listen to the second song, did I realize what was in store. Every song was so smooth and pleasing to the ear. His voice sounds so much better on this album, than previous records. Bottom line is, I'm hooked on this album, one of the best I've heard in a long time.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|I previously owned the original Blue Album, and it was totally worth the money to upgrade to the Deluxe edition. Everything was great.
B001041JKU|3.0|There isn't much more that can be said about the tracks on this re-release of \\"Thriller\\" that are from the original 1983 album.  Everything from \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" to \\"The Lady In My Life\\" holds up extremely well even a quarter of a century later.  This 25th Anniversary Edition also gives us both the single release version and the long version of \\"Billie Jean,\\" as well as a previously unrecorded track called \\"For All Time.\\"  With all new technology employed to clean up the tracks and make the sound crisper, Michael sounds fresh and new and revived (which I'm sure he is hoping will be a metaphor for this stage in his career, as well).      Unfortunately, though, the so-called remixes are very disappointing and do not enhance the value of this album at all.  The two tracks that feature will.i.am (\\"The Girl Is Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.\\") suffer from Will's lack of creativity in his verses and really only remind you how great the songs were when they were untouched.  \\"Beat It\\" featuring Fergie isn't really a remix so much as a few lines in a verse or two laid down by Fergie over the old track.  Lame and boring.  And don't let the \\"featuring Kanye West\\" tag on \\"Billie Jean\\" fool you: Kanye does not do a guest rap verse but rather he produced the new mix, adding a heavier beat and a couple of introductory grunts.  Ironically, the one stand out was Akon's version of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" which is a unique approach to the song, breathing new life for a new generation, and of course the second disc, which gives you also three music videos (\\"Beat It,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" and \\"Thriller\\") and a live performance by Michael at an awards show, is a must-have for any collector, as well.    It may be a little sad to say the only \\"new\\" music you're getting excited about is an album you actually already own, but with the case of this er-release, it's true.  Buy this album only if you want to hear rejuvenated versions of classics. You can skip most of the \\"new\\" stuff.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|This CD is so great, I decided to attend a recent performance of Sara.  She is GREAT!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Maybe I like the movie because I come from a family that values telling a good story.  Sometimes the fun is seeing how far you can go with it before the listener catches on.  And yes, I've heard some stories about family members that I'm not sure are true or not.  But enough about me.  I really enjoyed the movie.  I don't have complaints about any of it, and at the end I cried sentimental tears for a lot longer than I can remember about any other movie I've seen.  I especially like how at the end the son came up with a good story to tell his Dad.
B000ZK4466|5.0|Bedlam definition: disorder resulting from a failure to behave predictably. And thats exactly what this album is all about. While trying to avoid repeating the more obvious elements of this album I must say I was a bit nervous about buying the Bedlam in Goliath. Why? Because while Frances the Mute and Amputechure were both better albums than Green Day or Fallout Boy could even imagine pulling off, yet they both reflect the challenges of a band trying to follow up after the smashing success of De-Loused in the Comatorium while loosing a key member of the band and  often overlooked Jeremy Ward. While having many highlights both Frances and Amputechture both feel like bloated eps that could have benefited from more editing (like the 2 plus minutes of tape noise after \\"The Widow\\" and does anyone ever listen to the entire \\"Cassandra Gemini\\"?) and better mixing  (More Ikey, and what happened to the drums in Amputechture?). Then exits John Theodore, who disliked playing live shows, yet was an amazing drummer. Whats next?    Bedlam more than surprised me because I liked so many of the tracks on first listen as previous albums including De-Loused grew on me. This album is a return to form, literally! Somehow a nine minute song like \\"Soothsayer\\" sounded like it was three minutes long. The song structures are tighter on Bedlam, less experimental (a la Frances), more structured and shorter solos, less turn on a dime tempo and mood changes (a la Amputecture), sections connect more effectively, less meandering, and overall more accessible. But put into context Bedlam is as accessible as sushi! This is not mainstream music. Now that TMV is an octet this recording retains an amazing clarity and thanks to Rich Costy nothing gets lost in the mix. And don't worry about the new drummer, Thomas Pridgen, an alumni of Berklee college of music. I was pleasantly surprised with Pridgen's intensity and technical control of this complex music.    \\"Wax Simulcara\\" would have been a great first track. Perhaps the most radio friendly track, and TMV recently performed this track on the Dave Letterman Show. Wax shows Pridgen in command on the percussion duties while driving a hard and intense rock out that ends in a blissful freak out acid jam that on previous albums may have lasted till next year.   \\"Soothsayer\\" is an outstanding track, haunting, very effective, and is in a ten/four time signature. The heavy echo laden guitar sound that dominated De-Loused which I much enjoy is back on this track. I wonder what some sitar and tablas could have added to this and my personal favorite track. The added string section enhances the depth of this song. Bravo to Omar for his opening guitar/sitar phrasing, and outer space effects!  \\"Goliath\\" has a catchy guitar riff, while Cedric's high end vocal screams are able to conjure ancient spirits. The screaming near the end is violent and scary.  \\"Aberinkula\\" has a blistering saxophone solo, this track has moments that remind me of Viscera Eyes, which is not a bad thing.   \\"Metatron\\" almost resembles Tetragrammton yet being shorter by 7 minutes (phew!) and has a killer bass line!  \\"Ileyna\\" is a pleasantly funky tune perhaps inspired by the Red Hot Chili peppers.   \\"Tourniquet Man\\" is an odd track that seems to fit well in it's short 2 and a half minute span. Perhaps the most mellow track, a kind of oasis.  \\"Cavalettas\\" has a lot going on, more focus on form, and interesting sound manipulations that do not become overdone.   \\"Agadez\\" rekindles ideas from \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\" and could have also served well as an ending track. Hey I can hear Ikey on this one!  \\"Askepios\\" is an interesting song which feels like two songs.  \\"Ourboros\\" has moments that seemed influenced by System of A Down. With its soaring chorus, and heavy syncopation, this tune contrasts well between smoother and more intense sections.  \\"Conjugal Burns\\" has an almost humorist, Halloweenish bass guitar sound from Juan Alderete. The scream near the end has to be Cedric's most intense ever!    Hearing this album the first time was like reading a novel that you couldn't put down. The intensity and creativity of this album keeps me captivated for the duration, which few albums as a whole can do. One can read about the storyline/concept of this album elsewhere. Keep in mind that Cedric and Omar have repeatedly stated that the message of their music is meant to be obscure, you are free to interpret it any way you want! But go ahead and blow your mind by researching and investigating the meanings of the song titles, words, and artwork. For every answer you find a new question emerges. Less is more, and more is less at the same time. This is music that almost defies description with words, you just have to hear it. And if your open minded, and like De-Loused you will not be disappointed that you did.
B000LE16VW|5.0|I LOVE this movie, especially the scene where Patrick Swayze goes to meet Oda Mae, and watches her at work, and ridicules her.  REALLY funny.
B000OVLNII|5.0|When considering reading any non-fiction, my first reaction is 'how will I get through it?'.  This book does not read like so many dry, lacklustre non-fictions.  It is engaging, intriguing, and best of all, it fleshes out these people who helped shape our nation.    When reading about Lincoln's life, his political campaigns and challenges, it's nothing like what we've come to view as \\"history\\".  Instead, it is His Story and makes him so much more human and real.  You get to feel as though you really know him; not just as a President, but as a complex person of great depth and emotion.      Doris Kearns-Goodwin has breathed life into Lincoln and his contemporaries, and given us all an insight we would not have had if not for her brilliant writing.
B001041JLE|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" gets the royal treatment on its 25th anniversery,this time including five remixes from the likes of Kanye West,will.i.am,Akon and Fergie,a very good unreleased track from the \\"Thriller\\" sessions \\"For All Time\\" and the DVD containing all the classic videos of \\"Bille Jean\\",\\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\" plus the legendary moonwalking performance of BJ from \\"Motown 25\\" that sent MJ  and \\"Thriller\\" into the stratesphere of \\"The World's Biggest-Selling Album Of All-Time\\".The real reason to pick up this reissue,to those who already have this,is the remastered sound of the original album(done by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound),which easily surpasses the previous [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]] edition from 2001 in terms of bass,clarity and dimension.It makes the album sound sound fresh and new again.Yes,MJ is weird,but \\"Thriller\\" still sounds wonderful after all these years!
1594489505|5.0|One of the best books I have read and it helped me to understand what a country like Afganistan has gone through for so many years, not to mention the treatment of women elsewhere in the world.  I highly recommend this book.  Mary in FL
B00005JPUN|2.0|This film started out very well, and I thought briefly that I was onto something good. The editing and pace of the story was excellent, writing crisp, and Ms. Kidman seems to be aging beautifully (of course \\"aging\\" is not the correct term to use here. Surely, the actress is growing older, but her beauty is sharper and clearer than when she was younger, as if time were shaping away all parts of her that didn't glow). Also, the film makers seemed to understand that true horror in film is always psychological and NOT physical or visceral (meaning SAW I, II, III, IV were not scary at all).<br /><br />But, I suppose it was inevitable. About half way in things began to unravel. The pace became overheated and characters suddenly became very, very boring. Buy the end of the film it was a stock, very un-special action/car-chase movie.<br /><br />Finally, whereas the book and two previous films worked from the premise that, yes, the alien invaders offered a world without war, hunger, rape, strife, etc; it was much grander and more joyful to be human.  The concept of this film was that, clearly, it would have been better to allow the aliens to take over, and the only reason the Nicole Kidman character resisted was because her son was \\"immune\\" to the transformation and was going to be \\"taken care of.\\" Thus, the film makers miss, subvert, and completely loose what made the original novel and original film so special.<br /><br />All in all, a film made by aliens, absent of the strife, chaos, and inspiration that make it such a blessing to be human. - Mykal Banta
0307387178|4.0|I enjoyed this book and could relate, as I think we all can, in some ways to the main character of this story. It is so unfortunate that his adventures ended in tragedy and I can't imagine how the fates could play such a mean trick on a young kid with such a zest for life. OK, I will agree that he may have been a tad ill prepared for the last leg of his venture, but it kind of gets me angry how sometimes the smallest of details could just steer one's life in a different direction - or end it!   The book, in my opinion, was well written and held me fast to my seat, given the subject matter. We're not talking about a thriller novel, and I think Krakauer did an excellent job of bringing the reader into the story and used all the information he had at his disposal. His personal story of climbing the Thumb did make me laugh at one point despite the heaviness of this story.   Regardless of what some people believe or don't believe in why or how McCandless died, I feel that this book and story is something that could be shared with younger kids who may not have an aim or are in search of something or feel ostracized - that is not to say they should follow the same steps taken as Chris - but more so to allow them to connect with someone else and know that they aren't the only ones in the world who feel the way they do.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|I am not a suicidal person.  Never really occurred to me before.    Listening to \\"9\\" is an experience for me.  I can't just listen to one track.  There's a journey for me from start to finish.    From the first time I got home with \\"9\\" (I was studying in abroad when \\"O\\" was released and got it there, hadn't heard anything about 9 until I saw it in a store later) I was crushed by its power. Yes the lyrics are simple and often repetitive during a song, but combined with the music, they are powerful.    I've never though about suicide before, but somehow \\"9 Crimes\\" is erie enough to make me want to sit at my kitchen table with a handgun, my best bottle of whiskey and a glass, wearing an undershirt and hiding my head in the shadows.  And then the misery passes and \\"The Animals Were Gone\\" and it's the recovery from the misery, a chance for something.      I've listened to this album in the dark with the whiskey and I've listened to it on an ipod riding through the midwest after an ice storm watching the dead ground as I was mesmerized by the torture of the music.  The natural world, in my living room or the barren fields is emphasized by \\"Elephant\\" with it's chilling opening of \\"this has got to die.\\"    The opening of the album crescendos to the cathartic \\"Rootless Tree\\", which may be the most poignant break up song of all time, before the salvation of \\"Dogs.\\"    Although the album weakens some in the last half, it is still a terrific feat in my opinion.    If you ever needed a voice in the back of your head, buy this and listen to it enough...then it will be there.
1400063515|4.0|If you are interested in chaos/complexity science, I think you will like this book. My only negative is the excessive use of references with which I have no familiarity and the pompous intellectual style with which it is written. Don't get me wrong here... it is a very good book.
B00004RYCR|5.0|The book was simplistic and mediocre - the film is absolutely beautiful - it encompasses all the beauty, fragility, tragedy and irony of mature love. There is no moral judgment - after all God does not determine who we fall in love with, and did not give us control over our emotions, only over how we act upon them. Both Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood have delivered excellent performances - it is a classic love story.
0805079831|5.0|Extremely informative. We all sit back and have no idea what is going on in the world until you read something like this. Our value system and our humanity have gone awry. Capitalism is at its peak, and unless we all stand up to this kind of behavior, it will only get worse.  Whatever has happened to us, we no longer seem to care about one another - only money -and really, where does that get us.  Nem
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Catchy songs that are able to please a diverse set of tastes (my six month old likes it), Continuum will meet or exceed any expectations one would have of John Mayer considering his previous efforts. LM's music has moved into a more soulful, bluesy direction. Let's hope that effort continuues...
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I really liked this movie, and think that it deserves the Oscar it got more than many successful films of past years.  Good plot, good drama, good filming.
B000X1Z0BU|2.0|This movie is boooooooooooooring!  It doesn't at all know what it wants to be--a musical or a comedy--but it fails at both big time!    Because when I see a musical I want my feet to start a tappin' from scene 1, and that something that all the great musicals like Mary Poppins and other junk do.  Also a musical like West Side Story knows how to tell a story and create memorable, unforgettable tunes, weaved around the story that is so great.  I haven't seen West Side Story, but I understand the caliber of the film, trust me.  But as far as the musical numbers in Once go, all I can say is: WHINY MELODIES and PUTRID HARMONIES!  I know they say the musical is dead and there haven't been any good ones in about 40 years since Mary Poppins, but still they should try a lot harder.    As far as the comedy part goes, this movie is no Animal House.  What's great in Animal House is that it's a bunch of losers, but they're in a way treated like winners because we identify with them from the very outset of the film.  Who hasn't felt like an outcast and wanted to start a food fight, or put a horse in a classroom, or sabotage a parade?  I know I have.  And John Belushi, at the height of his fame, was outstanding as the fat guy in Animal House.  Also keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by Stephen Furst!  Sure some may call it college humor, but Animal House has it all for everybody!!    Basically the problem with Once is that it doesn't really offer anything, and it does not know what it is or what its voice is.  I did not enjoy it, mark my words.
B000H305U0|4.0|pretty good over all, a lot of the music especially whats on the radio sounds all the same to me but still good some of the songs not yet released are quite fun
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|4 thumbs up- not quite as enjoyable as the first season, tho I have to admit the episode where Barney goes on The Price Is Right (aka TPIR) has got to be my fave episode ever!   A good watch, very enjoyable, still very funny. Looking forward to season 3.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is a good buy for a well made watch. They are slightly overpriced in retail stores, but Amazon has some of them at  the price they should be at.     I love the watch and it's quite nice with casual and business events. Good weight.

I`m only begginning to decorate the thing I bake, i have been making muffins, brownies , drop cookies and cakes from years now, but always afraid of anything that involved using a decorating tip! But I thinks this book will finally force me to enter the world of decorating and cookie flair =P It has a lo of great pictures and not only that but the recipes and  even the prologue makes you want to explore all the posible options a little round or oval shape can bring into decorating.<br /><br />Thank you to the authors!

B00005JOHC|5.0|Very entertaining, this egregiously funny tv series has all the humor anyone could ask for in today's age of 'on the edge and over the top' story telling. It's good to know that we don't need cartoons to keep us entertained.
B000002JSP|3.0|I listened to ITTOD and Coda for the first time a few months ago. I'd heard that both were not considered anywhere near the quality of Zep's other albums and I have to agree. However, ITTOD is a lot harder to listen to than Coda. 'In The Evening' is.....dull and plodding. Some reviewers say it is classic Zeppelin but I can't agree, I just find it boring. 'South Bound Suarez' is fun; not memorable but definitely fun. 'Hot Dog' is also fun if only to hear Zeppelin do honky tonk. 'Fool in the Rain' another yawn, sorry. I actually like 'Carouselambra' if only for the section where Jimmy lays on those heavy chords; gives the song a bit of gravitas after JPS's bouncy keyboards. 'All My Love' is....nice. It's grown on me a bit but it's hardly SIBLY. And then the best track on the album; 'I'm Gonna Crawl'. Love it; at least the album ends on a high.  I've read that Page had some problems at the time which left JPJ and Plant to construct most of the album. JPJ is a wonderful musician and almost as essential to the band as Bonzo was but he's no songwriter as ITTOD shows. Someone said that if the three tracks on Coda that were left off of ITTOD had been on the album it would have been very different and I agree with that too - Ozone Baby, Darlene and Wearing & Tearing would have made ITTOD a fine album. This is all just my opinion of course but I've listened to ITTOD a number of times now and it's just not growing on me. I listen to Coda a lot and enjoy its rawness, something ITTOD sadly lacks.
B000IFS0HM|5.0|This is a life of an individual and family that is so difficult that it is hard for  anyone to comprehend.  I watched an interview with the author on C-span 2 which decided me to buy the book.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it and marveled that he survived.

B000NYT1M6|4.0|My son got this toy for Christmas.  He plays with it all the time.  The neatest thing about it is that there are so many other construction toys in the line that share the same detail and scale.  My son is 6 and never tires of these (nearly 2 months now).
B000YMBBH0|3.0|All three titles were received but were not packaged as a set as had been advertized. They were just three single DVDs.  As I gave them as a gift, I expected they would be boxed as a set and were not. No harm done but not exactly what I had expected.
0143038419|5.0|I really did enjoy this one quite a lot. In fact, I'd like to read it again soon. It really made me think about a lot. Now, I'm not ready to fly over to Italy. Or to get a guru. Or anything like that. But I can take more time out to get in touch with my spirituality. I can take time out to appreciate what I have. Well, I suppose if I questioned other people, I'd find a lot of people would say the same thing. But I feel that too. And I think in a way, it's time for me to do that. And this book was good motivation.

B000WZAE0Y|5.0|A slightly different take on fairytales, for everone's inner child.    That said, it may not actually appeal to everyone, simply because of their own stereotypical prejudices.  My youngest daughter (27yo) was the one who actually wanted to see the film; so I pre-ordered it, knowing that she'd be visiting over the Christmas/New Year period.  Unfortunately the Post Office managed to lose it en route, & so she'll have to wait until her next visit to view it.    Instead I watched the replacement DVD, on a miserable cold day in January, with one of my granddaughters, who was feeling a bit under the weather & home from school.    She was enthralled; which in itself was amazing, as most of the film fare which I play for her, seems to get a non commital grunt of dis &/or approval, I'm never sure quite which it is?  Even I enjoyed the film, but then I like to keep a bit of the Peter Pan about me.  Even if it's only in my mind & not my body.    You don't have to be a child to enjoy a children's story, especially when it's so grown up about it.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I bought the Once soundtrack CD even before seeing the movie because I'd heard Glenn & Marketa play on one of the late night talk shows.  I've listened to it nearly every day since then--more than 6 months now!  I also got the DVD when it came out.  I only recently bought the \\"Swell Season\\".  Even though there is some duplication of songs from the soundtrack, there are others that make this completely worth having.  Of those, my favorites are This Low\\", \\"Sleeping\\" and \\"Drown Out\\".  This is great music and I hope we hear more from these two in the future.

B000K15VSA|4.0|I wanted to buy this item because it's not sold by Warner here in France. I'm pretty happy of my choice (although the briefcase seems a bit cheap). What i find strange though is that the little car packaged within, has on of its rear-view mirror that is broken and missing. I tried to look in the briefcase and wasn't able to find it. For someone who collect DVD special edition that's a shame but i didn't want to spend time and money and an exchange so i deal with it. Else, as always, Amazon did a great job about packaging and time delivery.
B000OPOANE|4.0|Being a Rush fan since 1984, their music has come a long way and this is the disc to prove it.  Putting the obvious anti-religious lyrics aside for a moment, Neil Peart has written some of the most thought provoking, insightful lyrics yet.  The MVI edition reviewed here was offered originally as a limited set. Recorded in 5:1 surround (great on a computer so equipped), and containing a documentary on the making of the CD, it puts the viewer right in the studio with the band.   From interviewes with their producer, to how Geddy, Alex & Neil come up with song arrangements, it's an excellent collection.  Just seeing Geddy write Malignant Narcissism from the vocal booth playing around with his Jaco Pastorious bass is just one of the highlights.  Not to be missed by any Rush fan.
B000BKJ78K|4.0|I bought this for my 8 yr old son birthday, and it was great! Great price, I got it in 2 days and we are both happy with our purchase. We don't care about a bonus disc.

B000MP0XIW|5.0|These series were produced - and introduced in late 1970s, but they are surely suitable for these days!

True to life capability that makes you into the plot!
B000286RKW|5.0|I don't see the point in writing a long drawn out synopsis of the movie Goodfellas because if you haven't seen it then quite simply you're blowing it big time.    One of the best movies ever created... EVER.    The bonus features for the 2 disc special edition are great. Interviews with everyone involved from the production crew to all the main actors.     Having the standard version of this movie on DVD is okay, but you can't call yourself a true fan of Goodfellas unless you own this edition.     [trivia: Saul Bass is the designer who created the artwork for Goodfellas. He also came up with the opening titles, which are as important to the movie as the rest of it. Bass designed nearly ALL of Alfred Hitchcock's film posters (Vertigo, Rear Window, North by Northwest, The Birds, etc).]
B0010ZR160|5.0|Ben Affleck has written (with Aaron Stockard) a superb screenplay adaptation of Dennis Lahane's novel GONE BABY GONE and has proceeded to direct this tough tale with an ensemble cast of both well-known actors and unknown actors and walk-ons from the streets of the Boston area where they grisly story takes place.  The result is a film so well tuned and realistic with a perfect sense of pacing and character development that it becomes a remarkable calling card for Ben Affleck's career as a director. That it is going unnoticed (with the exception of Amy Ryan's nomination for Best Supporting Actress) by the Oscars is a grave oversight !<br /><br />The time is contemporary Dorchester, Massachusetts and Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend/partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), become aware of a missing child Amanda (Madeline O'Brien) in their own neighborhood.  The child's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver), unable to cope with Amanda's drugged out mother Helene (Amy Ryan), knock on Patrick and Angie's door, pleading with them to help find Amanda: Patrick and Angie are private detectives who just happen to be an integral part of the neighborhood.  Reluctant at first to become involved in the now 3-day police hunt for the child, a hunt headed by the respected Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) who his lost his own daughter in similar circumstances and detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) and who as a triad feel they are competent to handle the case without the 'immature experience' of the young couple. But Patrick and Angie do become involved, uncover leads within the neighborhood that lead to the clues behind the missing child incident and in doing so, unravel a lot of corruption within the police force, and also discover differences between themselves that threaten their otherwise close relationship.  To say more would remove the incredible tension this story maintains all the way to the fadeout credits.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent, from the smallest roles to the most major ones. It is difficult to single out any performer for praise as this is truly an ensemble piece.  The flavor of the film is honest, unflinching, and refuses to ignore the grotesque incidents that must be shown for the movie to maintain its impact. Writer Dennis Lahane ('Mystic River', 'Shutter Island') is a master of detailing the spectrum of responses that ugly matters induce: even the most noble of intentions have their shadowy side.  Affleck finds all of this in this excellent film, a film so strong that it easily bears repeated viewings.  Highly recommended...but not for the squeamish.

B001041JLE|5.0|Michael Jackson is the main reason why i even care about Music. He is a Musical Genius. He changed the whole course of American Music forever. this Album to Me is Probably the Greatest Album ever made. Quincy Jones, Rod Temperton and others had a hand in the material,but the center and most important Creative force of this Project is Michael Jackson. He wrote Billie Jean which is timeless as is Beat it and wanna be startin somethin. other classic cuts on here are Human Nature, Baby Be Mine.<br /><br />the new mixes stank and nothing is close to capturing the Magic of the Original Thriller.  this is a good thing in that it shows how weak alot of these acts of today truly are and they don't stand a chance up against  a classic.<br /><br />Thriller was a Album that changed the whole culture worldwide and is still felt after all of this time and will always be.<br /><br />I got more out of the 2001 version which had audio commentary which would have been nice on this one. I suggest get the Original and play fresbie with the re-mixes.
140120306X|4.0|The Black Dossier has a level of complexity that's far beyond the average reader. Moore makes so many references to famous literature both in the characters he uses and in the writing styles of the various Black Dossier segments that many people will be confounded at the meaning of a large portion of this story. I read a lot but still I was Googling many names to get a better understanding of the story. If you haven't read many of the more famous 19th & 20th century works of fiction then you may want to wait for the proper Volume 3, which is in the works. The Black Dossier will delight some and baffle many.

B00006RAKP|5.0|This is one fantastic collection of Elton's greatest hits.  It has two CDs, and they sound just great.  If you're looking for a nice collection of Elton John's music, you certainly can't go wrong with this album.
0321525655|5.0|This one is a no brainer. Buy the book. Here's 3 reasons why:<br /><br />- It's Simple, clear, brief and to the point. I find the length of the book a huge selling point. I don't want 400 pages of crammed text on the topic. Garr covered the topic thoroughly in under 250 and the fact that I didn't have to spend a week reading it makes it all that much better to me.<br /><br />- Focus on design.  Reynolds understands that a good presentation is a well designed presentation. People do judge books by their cover and if you want your presentation to succeed it better look good.<br /><br />- The story. It's all about the story. If you don't have a good story to tell, then people are going to have a hard time connecting with you.<br /><br />Kudos to Garr Reynolds for an excellent blog followed up by a well written book.
B0013ANMWY|5.0|this movie was just awesome. maybe the plot was a little cliche, but i had adrenaline pumping through me the entire time. this movie was so intense. but the whole thing was intense. O and it had a nice ending too. the problem with recent movies like cloverfield and i am legend, were the endings. but i was pleased with this one. i highly recommend it.
B000VJ271A|1.0|This DVD was a great disappointment! I only rated it as \\"one star\\" because there was no lower option.  The principals sang reasonably well, but the setting was terrible (background looked like a bull ring), camera work and staging were poor, and it was much too long ... requiring two discs because of the overly long \\"bonus\\".. There are better Manons available so dont waste your money on this one!
B000MQC9H4|3.0|I received the DVD in the expected amount of time, but the cover is kind of messed up, like the plastic was melted or something.  The DVD obviously works fine, though.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|WOW!!! I can't believe the negative reviews for this film, but I guess if there wasn't diversity, the world we be a pretty boring place.    But this movie shows the world as anything but boring. Yes, I agree with those who say it can be extremely difficult to adapt The Beatles songs to a movie, but I think that this was an EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL endeavor on the part of the director.    The performers in this production really personalize the music they're singing, and that's what it's all about, isn't it?! We could just hear The Beatles tracks over the storyline, but where's the adventure in that? And that's what this movie is: An Adventure.    Cinematography: A+  Story Line: A+  Casting: A+  Acting: A+  Choreography: A+  Directing: A+    If you like love stories, or The Beatles, or musicals, or reality/fantasy movies, I think you'll like this movie. I haven't seen this two disc dvd set, just the movie in the Theater but, I think in this case, more IS better.

This is a great read and I think that most women can find themselves somewhere in this book. I read thru it once and then a second time to highlite the passages that touched me the most. I don't usually read these types of books, but this one really got me! The writer has a great sense of humor while being able to deliver a message. Enjoy....

B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I would recommend that everyone buy this DVD for a mind opening experience, and to support support deserving art and artists in music and video today. Adam Jones works again with Alex Grey (Gray, damn alternate spellings) this time in CGI. I admit that this is not my favorite video, but the new medium allows for some more unique and surreal images to experience with such an amazing track, truly mind bending stuff.    The extras on this DVD are the best on any Tool DVD yet, with featurettes about the art of Adam Jones and making of Tool videos and a short special on Alex and his wife's project CoSM in NY. Cool artwork, I really want to visit it some day.  Widescreen format is a step forward for this video too.    Think for yourself. This is my tool of a review.  Beardo
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|Katharine Hepburn went from box office poison to box office magic with her magnificent performance in \\"The Philadelphia Story\\". She, along with the stellar ensemble cast, make this movie one of the all-time greats. At the center of the storyline is Tracy Lord (Hepburn), a somewhat pompous young woman, who is set to be married in a society wedding. Her intended, George Kittredge (John Howard), is a common man who has made good in the mining industry. When her ex-husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant)appears on the scene as a pawn in a blackmail scheme initiated by \\"Spy\\" magazine, he brings with him writer Macaulay Connor (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey, who incidently was nominated for an academy award for her performance). In exchange for getting the scoop on the Kittredge / Lord-Haven nuptials, the publisher of \\"Spy\\" has agreed not to publish the story of a supposed \\"fling\\" that Tracy's father is having with a New York dancer. Therein lies the plot of the movie. However, on a deeper level, the movie addresses an awakening of sorts as, over a two day period, Tracy Lord is referred to as \\"the ice goddess\\", receives a dressing down by her father who call her a \\"prig\\", and by her fiance who \\"compliments\\" her by tell her she is like a goddess who is to be worshipped. The most touching line in the movie is when she says, \\"I don't want to be worshipped...I want to be loved\\". So there you have it...hopefully you will be enticed to watch the movie. You won't regret it. The movie is full of laughs aside from its more serious moments, I especially enjoy the performance of Virginia Weidler as Dinah Lord, Tracy's much younger sister. Watching her sing \\"Liddia, O Liddia...etc\\" is a delight in itself. She's a real character. Katharine Hepburn refered her in her later years and was quite fond of her. Anyway, if you're a Katharine Hepburn fan and can stand not having her teamed with her beloved Spencer, this is the movie for you!

0385470819|3.0|This book is author John Grisham's first novel. It is also, naturally enough, his personal favorite.     \\"A Time to Kill\\" had an indifferent reception from publishers. It was subsequently given a more prestigious release after the best selling  success of \\"The Firm\\" and \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"    I would probably rate \\"A Time to Kill\\" with three and a half stars, if that option were available to me on this web site. It is not a bad book, but it is awfully derivative. If you have previously read Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" much of the material in \\"A Time to Kill\\" is going to seem familiar to you. The time frame, the specific crime and the location have changed, but otherwise it is a short drive from a courtroom in segregated Alabama to a racist courtroom in Mississippi.    To put it another way, would you prefer watching the motion picture \\"In the Heat of the Night\\" with Rod Steiger or the weekly television series with Carroll O'Connor?
1563894696|5.0|This is one of the best Batman stories out there today. Revolving around the relationship between Gordon, Dent, and Batman, the Gotham Triumvirate is what I came to think of the group as, the story is pushed on by the threes desire to rid Gotham of crime and what lengths each will go to to produce results. The art is very nice Tim Sale does justice to the story with his art. Definitely worth a read and highly recommended for first time Batman readers.
0783240236|1.0|First off, let me give the nerds the afternoon off and pre-spam my review with insensately hostile personal attacks because I have the audacity to have an opinion which differs from those of the herd.<br />And now on to the review.<br />The movie is shockingly bad.  It starts off with Tippi Hedren being filmed through vaseline every time the camera lovingly ogles her starry-eyed face.  She is a spoiled Paris Hilton type who pretends to work in a pet shop so as to get some face time with a total hosehead who goes in there to buy some birds.  This hosehead is supposed to be something to yell for, but instead he has about as much charm as a guy in a hemorrhoid commercial.  Tippi then decided to chase this hosebag all the way to a small town, find out about where he lives, rent a boat, slowly make her way across the bay... The screenwriter should have been taken out and shot for being criminally boring.  The movie has an interminable and completely unnecessary and uninteresting \\"human interest\\" premise which involves Tippi basically stalking hemorrhoid man.  The two are destined to be destined for each other.  But you, the viewer are simply destined to waste two hours of your life watching this claptrap.  Moviegoers must collectively insist on not being bored to death.  Movies are supposed to be MORE interesting than real life.  That's why they are called \\"entertainment\\".<br />Okay, I owe the movie the sincerest apology.  It's like I've just suspected:  the film is a masterpiece.  It's a message picture.  The message is, \\"People are garbage; the birds can't take it anymore.  The birds must kill.\\"  It's just like David Lynch's The Angriest Dog in the World, only its The Angriest Birds in the Town.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!<br />Ok, to recap... the movie takes far too long to get going.  And NONE of the characters are even faintly likeable.  But once the birds really take a special dislikin'... all hell breaks loose.  The scene in which the gas station explodes I dug special.  Pure chaos.  If I could change my rating I'd now give the movie four stars, subtracting one star for how mind-bendingly boring the first half of the movie is.  But the film is basically Peyton Place with birds attacking.  Plus the leading \\"man\\" has got some kind of Psycho situation going with that battleaxe of a mother of his.  He's a real mamma's boy.  Calls his mother \\"Dear.\\"  So the birds can't take it any more and they let loose on the town.  And rightly so.  The movie ends with the crummy people, now throroughly humbled, quietly mincing off while the birds, who've taken over, are basically saying, \\"Yeah, that's right: take a walk, buster!\\"<br />The movie is an early prototype of Jurassic Park, which was obviously based directly on The Birds, though nobody seems to have noticed this.  In Jurassic Park there are even repeated references to how the dinosaurs are the ancestors of... you got it: birds.  The movie dramatizes some primal expectation that the earth will surge primitive and humans will be bundled off like refugees, like the rabble they secretly know themselves to be.

B000BI0WOA|5.0|This band was first seen by me in my hometown of Canberra Australia when they did their Australian tour in the 1990's, and I was blown away by the music    But what makes this the greatest of Greatest Hits CD's is that you have a double CD and you get both the Dire Straits and Mark Knofler's solo work.  The best of both worlds. It's also good value for money as a 2 CD set.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I discovered this movie years ago and have watched it every time I could find it on TV.  I was delighted when it came out on the DVD format.  For Audrey Hepburn fans this is a must have.  Even those who just like the older movies will find this one moving.  A fantastic movie and excellant cast.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|This is a great movie with tons of future shock moments and incredibly believable settings and acting. I especially like the fact that it's an apocalyptic film taking place in Britain; it's the first one I'm aware of.  This makes for some awesome moments like the \\"The world has collapsed...Only Britain soldiers on\\" video bit.  If you're up for a big movie night or weekend, I suggest a \\"Future/Alternate Britain\\" theme with the following movies: Children of Men, Brazil an...(read more)d Love Actually (probably the best movie about England ever made). If you want you can substitute the less depressing 12 Monkeys for Brazil -- although 12 Monkeys mostly takes place in the U.S., the theme is very similar to Children of Men. Or hell ,just watch all four, a double shot of Terry Gilliam never did anyone any harm!
B00008438V|4.0|\\"Wierd Science\\" is a pretty good story (for a change) that I would classify one of the \\"coming of age genre.\\" Years ago when I saw it I liked it, and so I bought the recent copy to give to my 15 year old who will watch anything. He loved it, and is trying, no doubt, to make Kelly LeBrock come out of his computer. (Even in spite of my warnings that THAT kind of pet is VERY expensive and extremely hard to train.)
0321525655|5.0|I do not have a lot of time to give a detailed review (I am working on a presentation for our CEO) but I think this book is awesome, and was immediately helpful. I also strongly reccomend A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|I realize that I am a few years late in offering this review.  But, I still enjoy this movie very much.  When it first came out at the cinemas, I saw it 4 or 5 times, which is probably a record for me.  Why did I love this movie?  Perhaps the main reason is that I love astronomy and I know that a comet could, indeed, hit our small planet with dire consequences.  Second, I loved the \\"realism\\" of the acting and script.  Third, I loved the music score by James Horner.  It was much better than the score to \\"Titanic.\\"  Fourth, I loved the photography.  Did anyone notice how often the camera focused on \\"hands?\\"  This movie is an essay in \\"hand signals.\\"  For example, a slight twitch of the fingers by Morgan Freeman (the president of the US, here) was enough to demonstrate the anguish within him.  Fifth, I like movies that deliver on the emotional level, rather than movies that are entirely centered on action, blood, and guts.  There are so many genuinely tragic moments in this film that it was hard to keep my feelings held within.  If I must list a negative aspect of this film, it would be that the portion of the film in which the astronauts are getting ready for their mission is too long and somewhat boring.  Perhaps much of this footage could have been cut.  Otherwise, this was a great movie, in my estimation.

0140157352|4.0|I read this book a few years ago, integrated it into my daily relations and field tested it across a range of situations. The theory is detailed, with example dialogues and tactical advise, but for me this has only been illustration. The best about this book is the changed attitudes to negotiation as a consequence of understanding it.<br /><br />This is a general prescriptive theory of negotiation, which means it goes for any relationship where different interests touch. The four key points are:<br /><br />1. Separate the people from the problem<br />2. Focus on interests, not positions<br />3. Invent options for mutual gain<br />4. Insist on objective criteria<br /><br />After you understand the examples, this is all you need to remember to be an effective negotiator. The challenge in practice is to steer the negotiation along these lines, and when successful, you get a friendly discussion about what you can easily do for the other person, with measurable results.
0689859414|5.0|Do you believe in Fairies? The man who originally created this book does. Like John James Audobon, (Arthur Spiderwick) A name given to protect the real person, actually went outdoors, and observed most of the creatures that Tony painstakingly had to re-paint. Although a few of them are his own creations.   In the restored version.  The original book was actually given to collaborating authors Holly Black (writer) and Tony Diterlizzi (Illustrator). Viewers and fantasy lovers will endlessly enjoy this book and beyond a shadow of a doubt be inspired by Tonys' wonderful illustrations.      Just a note from myself here, The original Arthur Spiderwick may have been considered to be in the Loony bin but I myself have seen what people call a \\"Reptilian\\" or \\"Reptoid\\" It looks very much like the Goblins in this book.  I was neither hallucinating or dreaming, and was never under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.    Authors and reviewers liken this to Joel Levys' book entitled \\"Natural History of all things Unnatural\\", which is a mixture of false information from the mind and folklore. The field guide is much more authentic because not only was it restored from a very old antique book but the folklore is accurate and the man who created it actually witnessed these things.    Supposedly the series that go along with the field guide, The Spiderwick Chronicles, is a true story from the Grace Children, *confirmed by Tony and Holly* Although some of it had to be fiction to keep the story moving along the way.    So go buy this book, and you never know, there just might be a \\"gremlin\\" in your house.      (Kendall)
B000001EC1|4.0|Even when my Rock music feedback is mainly based on British \\"Classic\\" and \\"Heavy Metal\\" Rock (i.e. Yes, ELP, Genesis, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Jethro Tull et al), I must admit that Bon Jovi is, certainly, ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS EVER (Made in America)!!!<br />This album includes almost every known major \\"Hit\\" of this talented Band.<br /><br />No loss for your Rock collection!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This performance of Eugene Onegin is absolutely the definitive one.    Ms. Fleming is simply the best Tatiana ever  - her singing is so full of emotion, heart break and perfect phrasing! What the sheer beauty of the sound of her voice, both in the top register and in the lower part of the voice - is stunning.  Equally mind-blowing is Mr. Hvorostovsky's Onegin. They are a perfect pair together - their chemistry is so real and palpable that one never doubts the sincerity emotions of the singers.    Orchestra sounds amazing, too, (as usual)    Set is very beautiful - but it work because of the grandeur and passion of the leading singers - with somebody else is might have been strange and rather bland.    All music lovers should watch this and be dazzled!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My husband (40), my son (3), and I (33) all LOVE these movies equally.  And it is SUCH a nice change not to watch another cartoon movie with our pre-schooler!  Very well done.  The best part of the boxed set are the 10-minute \\"how they filmed it\\" shorts at the end of each segment.
B000002MG1|5.0|Is there anyone who cannot admit that this is one of the Best American Rock Albums of the 90s?...  Just listen to the sad, slow rhythm and lyrics of \\"Everybody Hurts\\"...!!!!<br /><br />Hey, this album is so damn good, that even the amazing Paul Potts decided to make a \\"Classical\\" version of this R.E.M. Hit, sung in Italian (\\"Ognuno Soffre\\")!!!!... And even in this version, the song is still DAMN GOOD!!!<br /><br />Actually, I hardly could find bands that are able to produce music so fine, that even going thru such a change of musical style, and then having such a success!!!!
B00109T5WY|4.0|This is my first purchase from the band, but I really enjoyed it.  The first song reaches some really strong and loud moments that make you start wondering what's to follow.  Well, it seems to me that the rest of the album is trying it's best to slow you back down and settle in for a warm peaceful ride into your imagination.  Although they use the soft/loud approach, the peaks and lows are not as pronounced as one might find with Mogwai and GYBE.  Due to the fact that the lows and highs aren't incredibly far apart it allows you to set one volume and enjoy the entire album.    Although my first comparison would be to Explosions in the Sky, I also heard some (very few) moments of Massive Attack in their ambient beats.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|One of the great animated classics done well on DVD. This is one of those movies you will enjoy time after time throughout the years, it never gets old.
B0001XALTG|5.0|I loved this film when it first came out and I still appreciate it.<br /><br />It is funny, believable, tragic and never dull or boring.<br /><br />The song track to the film is just as good if not better than the film  Trainspotting: Music From The Motion Picture (Audio CD)<br /><br />It does deal with drug abuse it's not suitable for children at all! For us adults, it is very enjoyable, some laughing ,some crying.<br /><br />I Highly recommend it
0805079831|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the history of events and tactics used today in both the military but also paramilitary(police). It exposes and informs about issues that should be of great concern to most individuals. It is well written and if you are not familiar with how past events and behaviors set us up for events taking place today.It also ties in the psychology field of study with political tactics and goals and how this field of study advanced modern day politics and propoganda.
0792841344|5.0|If you've never heard of or seen Phantasm then you probably live in Iraq or are only two years old.  This is a CLASSIC!  Easily one of the best horror movies of all time.  The sequels get somewhat cheesy, but this one is worth buying.  Great horror film!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I saw Once in a theater with my teenage daughter and we were the only people there.  We laughed, we cried,  we listenened, we watched.  I had read a small, rave review in the New York Times some months before and also  enjoy mvoies made in Ireland and England.  I try to support independent films as well.    My daughter and I talked and talked about the movie, purchased  the music (which she now plays on the piano) and the DVD as soon as it came   out.  I'm pleased to say we've introduced Once to dozens of people who love it equally.  I hope many more  will see it.
0812975219|5.0|This book is worth reading. It will make you think twice about taking on too much risk in any area of life.   Too bad the management of Soc Gen didn't have this book, it could have saved them $7B.
0810994739|5.0|I bought the first book for my son, he couldn't put it down, he read the first book in a couple of hours and he laughed and laughed and laughed.  He's going to be so surprised when I give him this one.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Let me start by saying that I was a fan of Uncle Tupelo and I have followed this band from the beginning.  Still and all, I am not what you would call a rabid fan.  I'm really just not the rabid fan type.  Some of their records are better than others.  Records like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born are works that might be called high water marks in the career of any band.  That being said, I think it took a good two years before I made it all the way through AGIB.  That album hurts.  It's painful.  Sure, that's one of it's strengths, but sometimes you just don't want to feel that bad.    Sky Blue Sky is one of those records that, for me, does a brilliant balancing act.  The lyrics are amazingly depressing at times, but the music is so...hopeful.  It's as if Tweedy is saying: \\"Yeah, I'm a mess, the world is a mess, but that's okay.  We'll get through it.\\"  There is music for every sort of mood under the sun, and one of Wilco's strengths is that they have always been able to capitalize on that.   I had the same initial reaction to this record as a lot of other reviewers.  I thought it was a bit boring and the guitar work was a little too noodling for my taste.   I'm sure someone else has pointed this out already, but so much about how you perceive music is based on your expectations and where you are (mentally and physically) when you hear it.   Expectations for this record were undeniably high for a lot of people.  High expectations can, unfortunately, cause people to project what they want a thing to be, and tend to make it hard to appreciate things for what they actually are.  I initially stuck Sky Blue Sky in my itunes folder and forgot about it.  Then one night, when I was listening to Wilco on my computer, this record started playing and something just clicked.   Now when I'm feeling beat and tired and overwhelmed, this record always puts me in a more positive mood.  It feels comfortable.  It is the sky blue sky that makes those bad times not so bad.  Isit their best record?  Probably not.  It's not as complicated as some of their other work.  It doesn't demand as much of you.  But I've probably spent more time with this album since it came out than any other.  It definitely opens itself up to you slowly.    To me, this record seems like a natural progression.  It still feels like Wilco, and by that I mean it still feels like the same band that has changed and morphed many times before (and probably will again) somehow without ever sounding like anything but themselves. I think that most people who are fans of this band will find themselves putting this on at some point and saying: \\"Oh, yeah.  Right.\\"  And if you don't, then you can always tell me I was wrong.  I won't mind.
6305364648|5.0|True Lies  DVD<br /><br />True Lies is a movie about an U. S. spy (played by Arnold Swarzennegger) who tries to keep his true occupation a secret from his wife( played by Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of Tony Curtis, and her mother was Janet Leigh.<br /> Anyhow this movie has some hilarious moments, I especially like the used car salesman, who reminds me of an ex-friend.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Arnold Swarzennegger and Jamie Lee Curtis.  I didn't realize she could play a sexy role.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008
B000006SGT|4.0|I really like the collection.  The inclusion of \\"Bo Diddley\\" was worth the price.<br /><br />Two quibbles:  The collection doesn't include some of the later Eric Burdon and the Animals songs (but I understood that going in, just wish they could have worked out whatever deal was needed to get those songs in the collection) and the version of \\"We've Gotta Get Out Of This Place\\" is lame.  Eighth season of \\"Night Court\\" lame.<br /><br />Really happy with it otherwise.
B000001GBJ|5.0|The music on this Cd is just beautiful.  I listened to it while I was in labor with my second son.  It helped me to relax.  I highly recommend it.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Little kids will love this movie, besides the whole car vroom, vroom thing, it's got some great imagery.  It does have a predictable story line however it has no scary scenes to frighten smaller children.  The sound track is fun with up-to-date music and voices.  Pixar created some fantasic scenery incorporating car parts into the land and cliffs.
B0013FZI8K|5.0|This album is outstanding and genius (as always).  The deluxe edition has such crystal clear photographs with a gold cd and dvd.  Michael even writes a little somethin' to the fans.  Now I can watch Thriller on my tv anytime of day and love it even more.  Thanks Michael, one day I know I will get to meet you, if not, then only in my dreams (and on the deluxe edition cover).  YOU ROCK MY WORLD and anyone who says different can just BEAT IT!!
B000BCE918|4.0|Worth the money if you like Jurassic Park series. Well packaged and easy to use. Bought them for my daughter (she is 5) and of course loves them. Worth the money.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|\\"Eye in the Sky\\", originally released in 1982, is The Alan Parsons Project's (APP) 6th album, and is perhaps their best known and their most highly acclaimed work.<br /><br />The original release had 10 tracks that reflect (at least to me) the traditional APP mix of instrumental and progressive rock music, with a dash of pop thrown in.<br /><br />As for the original tracks:<br /><br />If you like APP instrumentals, this disc will please you with \\"Sirius\\" and \\"Mammagmma.\\"  They are both absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />If progressive rosk is what brings you to APP, then you'll like \\"Eye in the Sky\\", \\"Children of the Moon\\", and \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned.\\"<br /><br />If you like APP's mellow music, then you'll probably like \\"Silence and I\\" and \\"Old and Wise.\\"<br /><br />For APP pop, check out \\"Step by Step\\" and, to some extent, \\"Gemini.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, \\"Psychobabble\\" is a piece of techno-rock, similar in feel and tone to \\"Hyper-gamma-spaces\\" from the APP album \\"Pyramid\\".<br /><br />OK, that's an overview of the original tracks...<br /><br />Other reviewers have ably commented one the additional tracks that come with the current release - studio tracks, etc.  While one reviewer lamented the fact that the sound wasn't really that much (if at all) better, they, and I agree that the additional tracks are a real bonus.  The extra 6 tracks provide over 30 additional mimutes of music.<br /><br />While the extra \\"Old and Wise\\" and \\"Silence and I\\" lead tracks featuring Eric Woolfson, piano, and percussion are nice, they are not indispensible.  I enjoyed \\"Any Other Day\\" which has a nice sound.  The two real bonuses, though, are \\"Naked Eye\\" and \\"Eye Pieces.\\"  The former includes a medley of APP cuts from the track, while the latter is a mixture of choir vocals and symphonic music - a real treat!<br /><br />The extras make this offering enticing to established APP fans, and the original tracks will be enjoyed by those who are discovering APP for the first time - so everybody wins!!!<br /><br />Based primarily on the original release, I give this album 5 stars.  It is to some people what APP is, and what it is all about.5 stars.  It is to some people what APP is, and what it is all about.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|The chase scene in the beginning is amazing. The plot twists keep you interested all the way through.
0761145613|5.0|We are from Belgium. I got to learn about this calender through a friend, four years ago. Since I used it once, it is impossible to do without. I am totally addicted .... It is easy to plan all activities for myself, husband and two children and I hardly forget any appointment. Great calender, easy to use !
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|\\"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\\" deserves five stars for its beautiful costumes, magnificent sets and locations, and breathtaking cinematography, but only three stars for its approach to history and for giving Elizabeth I an enlightened and politically correct 21st century personality.<br /><br />The film deals with some of the most famous events of Elizabeth's reign - the Babington Plot which led directly to the trial and execution of Mary Queen of Scots, the invasion of the Spanish armada, encounters with Walter Raleigh.  Don't come to this expecting an education; the film has only a nodding acquaintance with historical facts.<br /><br />As you would expect, the visual quality of the DVD is outstanding.  The disc's special features include deleted scenes; short subjects on the making of the film; the reign of Elizabeth; creating the armada; towers, courts, and cathedrals; and a director's commentary.<br /><br />Recommended for its stunning visuals, but don't expect a history lesson
B0010ZR160|5.0|With his work in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and now with this film, Casey Affleck has truly come into his own as an actor.  He gives a subdued, low-key performance that allows his castmates to showcase their skills as well, yet he still commands more screen time than Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris.      Normally, this would have been  a predictable, formulaic kind of story in which kids go missing and are later recovered.  But there are twists and turns here that defy convention.  Even when a missing kid is recovered, the family that s/he goes back to is not necessarily a desirable one. This is an important point to remember.  You can think you are doing the right thing in the eyes of the law, but that doesn't always mean  it's the best thing.    This is the hard lesson that Affleck's character learns by the end of the film.  You'll be thinking about this for quite some time after the movie is over.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|I just finished watching this film and am amazed that anyone would give it a good rating.  It was hard for me to watch to the very end.  I considered pulling it out of the dvd player during the last 25% of the movie because it was so tedious.  This is not a new storyline either.  Other movies have been made with the same plot.  The special effects were the sole redeeming factor.  The ship and the shots of the sun were good but not good enough to save a flakey movie.  No great acting, a predictable plot, and a hoakey ending.  There are plenty of great science fiction films available for view, but this is not one of them.
B000BVD460|4.0|A collection of his Greatest Hits, however I feel a few others could have made it on here like \\"Superman\\" and \\"Drug Ballad\\", but ah well.    Still a nice CD to have and the guy deserved to have one after his years of strong work. I would have to say though you'll never get the full effect he has without getting an actual album cuz to be honest, some of his hits can't hold a CANDLE to songs like \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"Still Don't Give a F***\\". Either way, nice to have except nowadays most people already have these songs and can put them on their iPod which defeats the purpose.    Oh and there are 3 new songs. \\"Shake That\\" feat Nate Dogg (who ironically is on it more than Eminem), \\"When I'm Gone\\", and \\"Fack\\". \\"Shake that\\" is bomb as hell Em and Nate do they thing, \\"When I'm Gone\\" is good, deep...but a bit depressing/emo to really bump a lot, and \\"Fack\\" is just....ridiculous, sounds like some bad Encore cut. Also interesting enough they feature a live version of \\"Stan\\" with Elton John, nice to have too but really makes no difference because the original is on there too.     Overall, nice if you don't have an iPod, if you do I'd still download \\"Shake That\\" on iTunes if you haven't already.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|This movie is a failure on so many levels and in so many aspects, it's hard to know where to begin. The most obvious problem is its complete lack of subtlety and humor -- this movie is perpetually and unremittingly blunt and on-the-nose, quite painfully so.  The music is flat and under-orchestrated, the actors are bland and unengaging, the mechanics of the plot are preposterous and strained, the pop culture references are so utterly lifeless -- one wonders why this movie was made in the first place. I BLAME JULIE TAYMOR.     Oh, well.. I could keep going... I could provide specific examples... I could use reasoned arguments... but it doesn't matter. The people who like this movie will love it, and those who don't will scratch their heads, take it back to the Video Hut and wonder how wrecks like this get made.  I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt, but I was burned, maa-a-a-a-nn.  It stole two hours of my life and made the Beatles sound sucky and trite. Not good.  Bad.  Evil.  Nooooooooooooooooooo. (Axton)
B00006690G|5.0|This is in my opinion the last great solo album from Eminem and possibly the best material he has ever released. This album he still kept it true, but he shows a lot more emotion and a lot less of his original psycho persona that was known on previous albums. This was my favorite album for years and still remains one of my favorites with every song bangable and lyrical. A must have if you love true hip hop and especially if you are an Eminem fan.       1. Curtains Up (Skit) - N/A - Just a skit of the Curtains for his \\"show\\" opening.     2. White America  - 4/5 - Good song to start the album up with, lots of energy and emotion. Em raps about how he owes most of his fame to the fact that he is white. A racially charged track about the impact of his whiteness in hip hop and America, great song with excellent lyrics and views, but not as catchy as others on the album.     3. Business - 5/5 - This beat alone gets 3 stars, amazing Westcoast funky type beat from the Diggity Dr. Dre! The lyrics are funny and normal Slim Shady-esque before he watered down his witty songs to absolute ridiculous bull. One of my faves on the album.     4. Cleanin Out My Closet - 4.5/5 -  Deep song, unlike \\"Dear Mama\\" by 2Pac, this is a track to his mama in the worst light. He exposes her abuse to him as a kid as well as lets out all his emotion of his past and present. Great song to let out issues of his life. Not forced and genuine track, can get tiring though after a few lessons though.     5. Square Dance - 4.5/5 - This was my favorite song for a long time. Political track against the United States and the War in Iraq as well as another track stating his purpose in American society. Witty, hilarious, and just plain ILL with the flow. I love this song. The hook could be a bit better, but still rather catchy. The outro with him impersonating rappers is hilarious too.     6. Kiss (Skit)  - N/A - Another skit based on a real life event. Eminem is with his friend and spots his wife cheating on him by kissing another man. He runs up to do his infamous pistol whipping and the next song beigins....    7. Soldier - 3.5/5 - For a long time I wasn't crazy about this song, but it grows on you. I had a few issues with the fact he claims he is gangsta when it is rather obvious Eminem may be tough, but is not repping a set. That made this song an issue for me for a while and still to this day bugs me a bit. Other than that, I liked the gritty tale of murder, trial, and nonsensical violence. You can feel his prescence and anger which is something I will always love from Eminem.     8. Say Goodbye Hollywood - 5/5 - Deep song that really hits home. I feel he almost has a 2Pac type vibe on this (not saying he is anything like Pac, nobody can ever be, R.I.P.) but the topic sounds \\"Me Against the World\\" ish. He raps about leaving the fortune and fame because of the craziness his life has become. He lets it all on the line and the hook is very catchy along with the ill beat. Fantastic.     9. Drips - 3.5/5 - I would say 3 stars, but the beat and hook are bezerk! The topic is interesting and original, have never heard a song dedicated to STDs before in hip hop, haha! Em's protege Obie Trice delivers a bland off topic verse about discriptive sex with some lady, he doesn't even set the topic until the last few bars which made me feel most of his verse unnecessary. The Bishop in Juice line although played was pretty good though. Eminem rips the song as he always does on collaborations, his verse is good about how he finds out his girl has AIDs and gave it to him. Em saved this thing.      10. Without Me  - 5/5 - I don't care if this song is poppy and whatever, this was the ish! I used to blare this song over and over until my homies told me they had enough. Witty, funny, clever, and the Dre beat is bangin', this will be one of my favorite bangers for years to come. This song never gets old! I love it!     11. Paul Rosenberg (Skit)- N/A - Pointless skit, Paul calls him up and tells him to stop firing his gun around. Could have just been placed at the beginning of the next song and wouldn't have wasted an entire track...    12. Sing for the Moment  - 5/5 - Deepest song on the album. This was the first time I heard this side of Eminem. He gives it to us full power. He explains he isn't as bad of a person as we once thought, I remember this song shocking me for hearing him say that and deny his alter ego like that. Wow. He wrote this in jail with all the issues on his mind, this may be the best deep lyricality we will ever see from Eminem. Legendary.    13. Superman - 4.5/5 - Another sex/love gone bad song. I like that this one isn't necessarily about Kim but is about some random woman in general because we all know how played Kim gets in his music. I like it, but it took a while to grow on me due to the beat being rather slow. Great hook and nice story telling, I blare this whenever I'm pissed off at a guy or a boyfriend, great \\"screw the opposite sex\\" song.    14. Hailie's Song  - 5/5 - Although Eminem isn't much of a singer, gotta give him propz for trying. I think this was the beginning of all the rappers trying to sing, oy, should've left it to this. Inspirational and interesting, a song to his daughter. The lyrics and beat alone give it the 5, the singing just is minor, this song is the reason I became a huge fan years ago.    15. Steve Berman (Skit) - N/A - Another Steve Berman skit, haha, funny.    16. When the Music Stops - 3.5/5 - I would give it more but without a hook it gets a little long. D12 and Eminem rip it speaking about music vs. reality. I like songs like these and for once all of D12 gives excellent visuals and performances, nobody lags. Eminem's verse is one of his best verses he's ever done and the beat is rather nice. Just a bit repetitive without a hook or much beat change...     17. Say What You Say - 3/5 - I love Dre and I love Em, but this wasn't the best they've done together. It was good, but a bit bland. The production didn't change up much and it was basic. I was disappointed compared to other work from these two, especially together. A diss to Jermaine Dupri, good, but after a few listens it's just average.    18. 'Till I Collapse - 5/5 - This song blew my mind. Nothing more than that. Nate Dogg murders the hook. Eminem's verses are the best he's ever produced and probably ever will produce. Beat is blaring. This song is......wow, there are no words. Just listen to it and if you don't get this album, at least download this song, this is hip hop at it's best.     19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - 4/5 - Good beat, funny lyrics before they were forced, witty, and interesting. Em put his daughter on and she sounds so cute, haha. I like this song a lot, but definately is not something for younger kids to hear. I didn't understand most of it growing up and now that I'm older I listen to this and laugh my azz off. It's really a genius song for mature audiences, wow.    20. Curtains Close (Skit)  - N/A - Ken Kaniff is back and singing his own rendition of \\"Without Me\\" as the curtains close, funny the first couple of times then just skippable.     Overall: I give it 5 stars, no album is perfect, but this album was close in my opinion. This is the last real amazing work by Eminem other than his contributions to the 8 Mile soundtrack.
0765310015|3.0|Many people put Erikson up there with Martin and Jordan.  I just couldn't get into this book.  I was confused from page one and my confusion simply continued.  New characters were tossed out seemingly on every page, and after 100 pages, I gave up.  Maybe I'll try again later because the writing, imagination, and what I could make of the characters was very interesting.  He does give his characters some pretty stupid names, though.
B000023VR6|5.0|This PROVES Westcoast rap is the best style ever. Haha at least to me! After long anticipation, this dropped and killed ALL competition. I loved all collaborators on here boasting Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, Eminem, Nate Dogg, and wow...so many others. Loved every minute of it and CRAZY production!    True West Coast classic. Long az hell album, but it goes by quik listenin' 2 it!    The West was back with this one and NOBODY could touch it! Introducing the new style of G-Funk, dominating for years and years after.
078322740X|4.0|I bought this movie for my wife.  It's a good, fun, happy movie.  Light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.  There are plenty of quirky characters and the setting in New England is beautiful.  Once more, there aren't too many special features which is a bit of an irritant.
B00005AQF7|5.0|It's kind of sad....his first album was his best. He could never top his teenaged self. Classic.    All beats are fresh and all tracks are bangin'! This is one of the only older albums that REALLY holds up today and one of the only albums that I can still repeat over and over and not get bored with yet! It's crazy too because I've owned this thang for years and it never gets old.    His flow, style, lyrics were all fresh and different. Later all would sadly fade in time (he still one of the only great rappers around anymore though and prolly my favorite) but this was somethin' else!    Debatable as my fave album. It's just so damn FUNKAY!    West uuuuuup!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie.  I will say that it is darker and more grim than the series; many questions go unanswered, but still anything to continue that great show is a bonus.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Oh geez, where to begin? This album is by far the craziest album by Eminem and will always remain one of my favorites.     1. Public Service Announcement 2000 - (N/A) - Funny...    2. Kill You - 5/5 - Gritty, violent, lyrical, and hard. The beat is nice too. This is the style of hip hop we need to find again! Eminem at his darkest.     3. Stan - 4/5 - I don't know I was never as big of a fan of this song as everybody else...no pun there neither. It was very creative, Em rapping as an obsessive fan writing letters until he kills himself and his girlfriend. Eminem delivers the response verse which is very intersting too. The sampling is nice and the song is classically known especially for the Elton John performance at the Grammy's, but it's a bit overrated. I get tired of it after a while and not what you'd want to bang out the car window. Interesting.    4. Paul - N/A - Boring waste of time skit. I usually skip it.     5. Who Knew - 5/5 - My favorite song on the album, period. Speaking about how he had no idea he'd reach the level he is now at and also dissing the media for buying into it. Great song and the beat is so dope. Gotta love it.    6. Steve Berman - N/A - Another Steve Berman skit...kinda funny but after a while is whatever.      7. The Way I Am - 3.5/5 - The lyrics to this are amazing and so is the emotion, but the beat is a bit...I don't know, it's not even a bad beat I just don't like it like I do others. The song is really appealing as he shouts his defense and anger for being who he is, I like it but the emotion is a bit too overbearing. Genuine, but not as strong as it could've been.    8. The Real Slim Shady - 5/5 - I don't care if he hated this song, it was amazing. The only real happy song on the album, it's good to listen to this to lighten up the mood for at least a few minutes. Clever, witty, not forced, just ill. Dre, this beat is phenomenal, one of his finest productions.    9. Remember Me? - 4/5 - A lot of people don't like this track, but I thought it was bangin'! Gangsta ish right here! Dark, street gritty beat and ill hate spewed verses from everyone. The guests he picked for this song are good and he delivers of course the best enraged verse. Enragin' psycho muzik.    10. I'm Back - 5/5 - Another favorite on the album, him stating his return in his famous \\"Guess whose back\\" line. You can tell he had fun with this track, he is really playing around with peoples' heads. The hook is catchy but the kids get annoying in the background. Still a good song.    11. Marshall Mathers - 3.5/5 - Ahhh ok. I like the lyrics but the beat is too slow and no matter how many times I hear the hook I can't help but chuckle a lil bit. Eminem singing in a sweet voice about not giving a f*** and beating people down is rather hilarious whether it was meant to be or not. I like the disses in it. Could've been better, still good though.    12. Ken Kaniff - -10000000/5 - This is unnecessary on so many levels. I don't even want to know why he put this on here. Wrong....nobody wants to hear this sh**!       13. Drug Ballad - 5/5 - A song about drugs that is so catchy, has such a bumpin' beat, and such interesting lyrics, flow, and delivery you can't help but stay intruiged. Grand!    14. Amityville - 4.5/5 - By now the album keeps getting better and better. Another gritty street joint, real hardcore and violent. It would be a 5 but Bizarre's verse is really weak and pointless. His flow is ahhh and he raps about things nobody wants to hear or cares about in such a \\"matter of fact\\" way it's annoying and nothing less than that. Still a great song. It go hard!    15. Bitch Please II  - 5/5 - This song almost gave me a heartattack...in a good way if that makes sense! Eminem, Dre, and Snoop...three of my favorite rappers with Xzibit who does well and Nate Dogg who is one of my fave singers. I died. A remix to one of my favorite songs, this was incredible, everyone delivers strong. Great hook, strong Dre beat...ahhh. Beautiful.16. Kim - 4/5 - Even as a female I like this song. Really intense, so intense the edited version couldn't have it, haha! It's the prequel to his infamous \\"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\\" where him and his daughter get rid of Kim's body in the ocean. This is the set up of him killing her. Dark storytelling, it's great but you have to be in the right mood or else nah.    17. Under The Influence - 3/5 - One of the best D12 songs, but I dunno, it is pretty average. Everyone comes hard on it and it's catchy as hell, but there isn't as much on the excitement value for me, shocking lyrics, but yeah. Average.      18. Criminal - (5/5) - Great way to end the album. Angry, political, engraged, and nonsensical violence. Eminem ends it by dissing nearly every type of human being possible and going on a rant about murdering innocent bystandards. You gotta love it.    Overall: 5/5, Eminem at his strongest. It's hard to believe that the guy who made songs like \\"Fack\\" and \\"My 1st Single\\" could have penned this classic, but hell, people change I guess?

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought my Sony MDR7506s at a Guitar Center in Cincinnati, Ohio.  I was planning on purchasing something for half the price when the dude behind the audio counter took me aside and said, \\"Look kid: you could save a little money and buy those solidly mediocre headphones.  Or, you spend another $50 on these things and you've got a pair of studio quality muffs.  You can record with these babies, listen to records...whatever.  They're gonna sound great, feel great, and last you forever.\\"<br /><br />Five years later, he's yet to be proven wrong.  Buy these.
0205313426|2.0|I didn't find this book very useful at all.  The rules and rules of what is correct writing just didn't help me.  It is good to know rules, but the inflexible manner of this book was not very useful.  For instance, some books have to be grammatically incorrect.  Sentence fragments, run-on sentences, etc. all can build tension or a feeling in a book, but this isn't allowed according to Strunk and White.  A decent book at giving the fundamentals of style, but not one to slavishly ape.
B000005S5N|5.0|Some people say that \\"Hunting High and Low\\" is better or in the same league as this masterpiece. While I agree that tunes such as Take on me, The sun always shines on TV and Love is Reason are wonderful, life-lasting songs, not everything is above great, unlike Scoundrel Days. Every single song on this album is something to be reckon with. Lately I have been discovered the nitty, gritty lyrics of I´ve losing you (which I thought was a love song..) and I can´t help but listening to it 20-30 times a day, every day. The same with Scoundrel days, Cry Wolf, Maybe, Maybe and so on.    Along with Roxette, a-ha is one of the most underrated European bands of history. Nuff´said.

B000L9IUPM|5.0|We bought this in the HD-DVD version and it has become our favorite DVD of all time. Most rock groups, with age, try to remake their music so in the end it sounds nothing like the original. But the Eagles make it a point to retain the original sound, even the guitar riffs, and preserve their award-winning sound. These guys have definitely gotten older, but they are masters at their music and they can still enthrall an entire amphitheater of concert-goers. Watch it in HD and you'll be hooked, not just for the great sounds and harmonies, but because the Eagles have a wonderful stage presence and personality that people of all ages can't help but warm to. This concert went for 3 hrs in Australia, doing not only traditional Eagles hits, but covering the major hits of Glen Frey, Joe Walsh and Don Henley from their solo albums. It's a real bargain in entertainment and you'll find yourself playing it over and over. Buy it, you'll love it every bit as much as our friends from Down Under.
B000I0QL82|5.0|not only is this my favorite movie of all time, I love the extras  in the dvd.  Special features of the careers of both Fred astaire  and Bing Crosby are delightful.  Love it
B00005JNJV|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the first Tim Burton Batman movie of the 90s....but the rest of them were kind of garbage.  The final straw was when Joel Schumacher decided it was best to include nipples on the bat-suit, and light up gotham city with flourescent lights.  I honestly don't see how that movie made it past test audiences.    anyway, Batman Begins completely takes away the cheese of the other batman sequels and starts anew with an amazing cast, director, and story.  Christopher Nolan deserves the most praise here, weaving together a movie that flat out makes you believe a 6'2\\" billionaire playboy can run amok in the streets in a halloween costume, beating up bad guys.  Christian Bale has always been one of my favorite actors, ever since seeing him in the criminally underated Equilibrium (see it!).  His performance as both batman and Bruce Wayne is spot on.    The villains in this movie were great as well.  the Scarecrow has never been more terrifying, and Ra's (batman's oldest enemy, and teacher) offered more than enough trouble for batman to deal with.    I hold high expectations for this summer's sequel The Dark Knight, which by the way, is a great graphic novel (but not what the movie is based on, unfortunately).
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is simply the best thing REM ever produced and one of the best rock albums of the early 90's.  The band put it all together for this one and came out with an album of widely varied music that used all of the band's strengths to create a sonic masterpiece.  Just about every track on this disc is great.  The only one I don't really care for is \\"Star Me Kitten\\", but even that one is not terrible.  For the most part this album stresses more acoustic elements.  There are a few good rockers to be found (\\"Ignorland\\" being the best), but the album is ripe with acoustic guitar, mandolin, melodic keyboards, and string arrangements (done by Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones).  The album produced several hit single all of them excellent tunes.  \\"Drive\\" opens the album on a high note, \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is a song that just about everyone can relate to, and \\"Man On The Moon\\" is simply one of the catchiest singles released in the 90's.  The rest of the album is all great too.  There are no \\"Shiny Happy People\\" on this one as the majority of the material is quiet, reflective and at time depressing.  \\"Try Not To Breathe\\", \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight\\", \\"Sweetness Follows\\", \\"Monty Got A Raw Deal\\", \\"Nightswimming\\", and \\"Find The River\\" are all solid tunes.  If you have ever looked to get into REM I think this would be a good place to start.  If you are a fan this album is essential.
6305428050|5.0|This is one of the truly rare films that will have everybody laughing out loud regardless of age.    Amazingly, the film does it without pandering, and without dumb or gross out humor.    Elizabeth Shue is simply amazing in this.   Forget that she is drop dead gorgeous!   Her acting, dialogue and her chemistry with the kids in question is perfect.   Beyond that, it's even better! I can honestly say that every character you will see in this is a worthwhile addition.  How many movies have you ever seen that can say that?!  I don't say \\"rent it\\", I say BUY it.   FIVE STARS is not enough!   Many reviewers have mentioned something about \\"The 80's\\"   Totally irrelevant!    A hundred years from now this will still be a masterpiece.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Terrific collection for the ardent fan.  It may be a bit much for the casual fan, but having the entire ouevre at your fingertips allows you to appreciate director Ridley Scott's genius.
1592402038|5.0|I usually read escapist fiction. Since I spend my working hours writing factual matter (I'm a technical writer), I almost never read non-fiction, and it would generally be a cold day down in Dantes' neighborhood on which I would voluntarily pick up a book on - of all things - grammar. But, given this book as a gift, I was finessed into actually opening it.     What a great surprise! I hooted, I snorted, I laughed involuntarily until people looked at me sideways!     This is great stuff! Lynn Truss speaks to everyone that has ever winced at a lunch menu with a \\"Chefs Special\\" or \\"Kids Menu\\" or \\"Dilled Carrot's\\", etc. Though few of us actually spend a great deal of time and energy anguishing over the punctuation faux pas with which public literature is littered, many of us wince when confronted with them. Here is the hero of our wincing Inner Stickler!! (Go Lynn!)    This book is filled with good, silly, erudite anecdotes (the STET scene springs vividly to mind! I've been there, too, Lynn!) and hilarious examples. Although it is somewhat of a page-turner, it's made up of very short episodes, and so is easy to put down - though easier to pick up.    Not everyone will resonate with this book (just look at some of the reviews). To enjoy it, your Inner Stickler can't be too fussy and rigid to recognize some slightly different points of view that just might be equally valid. Conversely, you have to at least be able to perceive the differences in variously punctuated phrases; if to you \\"A woman, without her man, is nothing.\\" looks the same as \\"A woman: without her, man is nothing.\\" you should not bother to pick up the book. It would merely baffle and bore you.    For the right reader (and all writer readers, I would think!), this is a hilarious romp amongst the speed bumps and parking lot lines of language. Enjoy!
B000WO251Q|3.0|The beginning of the book was kind of slow, and I almost gave up reading \\"Dear John\\". I think it was because the growing romance between John and Savannah was so detailed, and lacked any emotional draw for me. I was also wanting to know more about John's father who had Asperger's, and his relationship to him. As I hit the half way point in the book, it became more interesting because John's relationship with Savannah became less about the details of their meeting and more about the romance building between them. Once John leaves for Germany, the book again hits another slow point, but before I knew it I was again quickly turning pages to get to the end of the story. Basically, this book has some high and low points.     My favorite part of the book was Nick Sparks development of John's character. I loved how he ended up being a man of true integrity, even though some of the choices he had to make made me cry. Would I recommend this book? I guess if you have the time, and don't have a stack of books you are wanting to read.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Howard Shore excels in his sound tracks for all three movies. Unlike so many movie sound tracks that interfere and are often just plain annoying, the music from LOTR carries the films along, complementing each scene. People who love the films can't help but love the complete recordings. The sound quality is superb and you can rerun the whole film in your head instead of just the usual excerpts. The accompanying booklet explaining the background to each piece is fascinating, if a little small in the print department. A magnifying glass might be a useful accessory if you wish to read the booklet fully.

B000XA5K48|4.0|This is a clever action movie that's basically a long chase scene kept interesting with good characters and imaginative dialog. Clive Owens now has won me over as a 007 candidate. Giamatti is deliciously repulsive and Monica Bellucci is just delicious. The underlying plot involving gun control is sweet irony to the fact that the action is a gun-lover's wet dream. Unlike Smokin' Aces, this movie understands its mood and tone and stays true to it. There is one little tweak I wish I could do to this film: change the murky explanation of Owen's man with no name from an expatriate gunmaker's son to a murky explanation of a British agent who lost his wife in a drive-by shooting. Then Shoot 'em Up becomes an unofficial sequel to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Clive even bears a resemblance to Lazenby, fer cryin' out loud!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|this film has influenced many sci-fi film-makers and inspired many fans since it was released a generation ago.  Whether you like the original version or the special edition version, the film itself is a treaure of cinema.  It re-shaped and revolutionized the way films have been made since its time.  It also has a great moral spirit to it, if you look beneath all the action scenes.
1596912855|5.0|What woman read the line (\\"Colin Firth in a wet shirt...\\") and didn't know completely what she meant?     I loved that the author kept her character's obsession with Mr. Darcy (via Colin Firth) alive throughout the book. It was a very cute idea to send a technology-dependant woman into early 19th century England. Even on her vacation, the main character has interesting issues with the men she meets. She also finds herself in situations not unfamiliar thanks to all of Jane's books.     Full of twists and surprises that kept me reading it all night until I got to the back cover. The only thing I want to know now is, where do I book my stay at Austenland?
B000WTNCQS|5.0|The Joshua Tree was always a ground breaking album for U2, not only for the change in direction for the band, but also in achieving worldwide acclaim. This remastered album provides an excellent reminder of the quality of music that the group were producing around that time, with a B sides CD, that would grace any U2 fans collection, if they haven't already aquired the tracks over the years. Finally, this edition comes complete with a DVD of the Paris concert during the Joshua Tree tour, which shows the that the energy of the band was as good then, as it is today.
B00005JPSM|4.0|A lot of people seem to be saying, \\"Don't watch this awful remake! Go watch [[ASIN:B00007ELFA Mostly Martha]], the original!\\"  I say, by all means, watch Mostly Martha, but don't bypass this version.<br /><br />It's true that if I had watched this without having seen the original version, Mostly Martha, I would probably have liked it even better. This American version is really too close to the original, right down to the appearance of several characters (Leah, the sous-chef, for instance).  For this reason, if you try to compare the two, it comes off as a half-hearted reproduction, Mostly Martha's reheated leftovers.<br /><br />In many ways, it does lack some of the heart and depth of Mostly Martha. The characters are not as deep and intense, so their relationships aren't as meaningful to the audience. Kate is not quite as tightly wound as Martha, not quite as isolated--so her sudden inheritance of a child and the infringement of a stranger in her kitchen are less difficult and less meaningful. Zoe is much happier and lively than Lina ever is, and is not as scarred by her mother's death, so her struggle to accept Kate is again less meaningful. Nick, I felt, was outstanding--he was different from Mario, but equally effective.  I actually preferred Nick, in fact, as I found Mario bordered on annoying at times, while Nick was more appealing all the way through (and Aaron Eckhart is certainly better looking!).<br /><br />So why did I give it four stars? Well, I'm a sucker for a good romance.  I feel that if I hadn't seen Mostly Martha, I would have given it four stars as a good romantic comedy. That is what is, and that is, I think, all it tries to be. It is fun to watch, the characters are sympathetic, the acting is excellent, the  chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Eckhart is wonderful, and the plot is engaging, if predictable.<br /><br />I also don't mean to say that No Reservations loses all the heart of Mostly Martha.  I think it retains it pretty well, while simply lightening up the plot a little.  Overall, I actually prefer this version in many ways.  I preferred the story without the presence of Lina's father, who to me interrupted the story considerably in Mostly Martha.  And if the characters here are a little less intense, they were easier to relate to, for me at least.  I found the romance between the leads more convincing here, and the ending considerably more satisfying than Mostly Martha's.  Kate and Nick, by the end, actually seemed a little more human than Martha and Mario ever did, and if the ending is predictable...well, some of us like happy endings!<br /><br />No Reservations may not fill you up with emotion like Mostly Martha, so don't coming looking for a full-course meal. This a essentially romantic comedy, the souffl&eacute;s of the movie world: light and fluffy and delicious..  Overall, I actually prefer this version in many ways.

B001041JKU|5.0|A quarter-century ago, Michael Jackson dropped the most spectacular collection of dance/r&b/pop ever assembled. However, it was on the release before that, \\"Off The Wall,\\" when Jackson actually broke the sound barrior. What sets Thriller apart from Off The Wall, as well as Jacko's subsequent albums, is that there are no dull moments on Thriller, and the formula was expanded by producer Quincy Jones to include a more broad appeal to pop music for the masses.<br /><br />This re-issue works, not because the new remixed tracks are spectacular (actually, aside from Akon's take on \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin\\" the new tracks are just O.K.) but because the classic tracks show us all when compared to the new artists contributing to this, just how superior of a talent Jackson is, or at least WAS, when he was at his creative peak. After the songs \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean,\\" a slew of artists changed their sound dramatically to mimic his sonic brilliance (witness Pat Benatar's \\"Love is a Battlefield\\" and Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin,\\" two songs that were basically transparent re-writes of MJ's hit songs). Only a true musical genius can make the entire musical landscape around him better. And perhaps following this album up was too much pressure for anyone (although 1991's \\"Dangerous\\" is pretty darn close to being just as good of an album).<br /><br />There are a few bonus tracks thrown in, including a re-recorded ballad from the Thriller sessions yet to be released. If the quality of this track is any indication of the tracks MJ has laying around in his vault, then shame on the King of Pop for not releasing them. And \\"Thriller 25\\" is not so much a trip down memory lane, but a glimpse of the future, as Jackson seems primed for a big 2008 comeback. By the end of 2008, MJ will be nearing 800 million records sold worldwide, and there is a reason for that. His talents are showcased on Thriller, but the full body of his work, including later releases which are more hit or miss but contain some of his better singles, needs to be heard in its entirety to absorb the diversity and depth of this man's music ability. As long as he remains relevant in the eyes, minds, and hearts of new artists producing hit songs today, he will continue to make relevant albums. Less than one year shy of his 50th birthday, however, the time is now if he is to regain commercial pop chart dominance.etter singles, needs to be heard in its entirety to absorb the diversity and depth of this man's music ability.

I read this with an open mind, thinking that much of the controversy was going to be along the lines of people thinking that the Harry Potter series was anti-Christian.  While the Golden Compass does not get into this tedentious anti-God philosophy, that grows through the rest of the book, poisoning what would otherwise have been a reasonable story.  Nothing to compare to Harry Potter or Narnia or Tolkien -- clearly second rate.

B000VSBX34|5.0|When this movie first came out, I was 14 years old. I had seen \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" four times in the theatre, and I was determined to see this one, too ~ at least more than once.<br />I was not disappointed, but alas, only saw it twice ~ until the days of the VCR/DVD player ~ and what a boon to the existence of a movie buff like me!<br />I already had my copy of the first movie on DVD and when this one was finally offered at a reasonable price, I snatched it up!<br />The story itself is full of silliness and fun, as any fan of the Beatles knows...these four guys knew how to \\"act it out\\" in front of a camera, even for an older person like myself, who is now 57 years old.<br />Nothing like the gory, slasher movies of today, this one was just what a movie-goer looks for ~ lighthearted entertainment, nothing too heavy or melodramatic, and a few good tunes thrown into the mix, just for fun! :)<br />Thanks to the British Invasion of the early 60's, our music has made a definite turn for the better, not only in Pop or Rock'n'Roll, but in many other areas as well, including, some say, Classical itself.<br />But what ever your taste in music may be, there is no denying that the Fab Four were alot of fun to watch ~ their antics, their brotherly closeness, their music...all in fun, all for one...and four for all!
0525950079|5.0|Having read The Pillars of the Earth, which I enjoyed very much, I was drawn to Follett's new offering, World Without End.  While this is not exactly a continuation of the earlier book, it is set in the same locale and does occasionally reference people and events from two hundred years earlier -- which is the setting for The Pillars of the Earth.  It's well done; one would not have to have read Pillars to enjoy World Without End.  The characters in World Without End are well-defined and the story has so many inner and connected substories that it maintains interest.  Ken Follett is very good at connecting all of the various storylines to make a comfortable ending.  This is a very good read with solid historic reference points, well-drawn characters, and intriguing plots.

B000JJSJR8|4.0|This film is not as well known as Scorcese's other big gangster saga- GoodFellas, but it is actually a fantastic follow-up to the former.  Instead of NYC, Scorcese sets this story of mafia mayhem in Las Vegas. There are two levels on which to watch a film like this.  First is to delve into the fascinating story of the different personalities that make up the criminal world and how they inevitably clash. This is particularly fascinating with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci doing just that.  The other level of enjoying this film is jumping on the fluid film ride Scorcese takes you on... constant graceful, majestic camera work that picks the viewer up in its hand and zooms you along... like being on its a Small Small World at Disneyland, but going much faster, and the message being... It's Too Small A World for both of us pal.. and moving a few clicks faster at least, accompanied by rock and classic jazz standards.  This is not your grandmother's Vegas.  Casino cheaters are dealt with swiftly and harshly and the endless desert landscape surrounding Vegas is not empty, but filled with people- all below ground.  If you like Scorcese, you must watch this film.  If you like Pesci, you will not be disappointed.  If you like Vegas, this film offers a fascinating \\"possible\\" history of how your favourite casino came to be.<br />Sharon Stone is very disappointing in this film.  Not a total disaster, but it is difficult to see what charm DeNiro's character found in her to give his life over to her.  But this is a small fault in the film.  This is a roller coaster ride with slow spots, but overall a great film ride for those who like a healthy quotient of violence and pathos.
B00012QM8G|5.0|The content of this movie is serious as a heart attack. I saw it in the theater and to say I loved it does it an injustice. It moved me deeply. To know this kind of inhumane treatment took place, and that one man made a difference for those whom he could leaves you tearful.<br /><br />This is a movie to share with your children as they get into their early teens (too much reality depicted for younger kids).<br /><br />Let us not forget those who died needlessly at the hands of the insane machine that was Hitler's Germany. If one cannot visit the death camps in Germany personally, this movie is the next best thing one can do to understand the enormity of this period in world history.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Outstanding! A concert video that bears repeated viewings - every friend who saw it bought their own copy! Incredible band in an incredible performance!
B000002MU3|5.0|After the brilliant [[ASIN:B000002MG1 Automatic for the People]], R.E.M. could have chosen to rest on their laurels and made a similar sounding album, or chosen to tour in support of AFTP.  Instead, they took an adventurous left turn into the land of dirty guitars and snarling vocals, emerging from the studio with this 12 song set.<br /><br />Peter Buck's Big Muff equipped guitar is given center stage here, but other effects and instrumentation give each track its own unique sound.  Reverb, echo, tremolo are all employed to add color to the distorted landscape.  Michael Stipe's vocals range from Iggy Pop-esque glam/punk rock to tender balladeer depending on the mood of the song.<br /><br />There are so many incredible songs on this CD, but standouts are the achingly beautiful \\"Tongue\\", the heartfelt Kurt Cobain-inspired \\"Let Me In\\", the eastern flavors of \\"You\\", and the mysterious \\"I Don't Sleep I  Dream.\\"  I also really enjoyed \\"Bang and Blame\\" which features a tremolo drenched guitar part that almost seems incomplete, giving the song an odd sense of urgency.  But in truth, there really aren't any songs on this album I dislike.  I tend to skip the opener, \\"What's The Frequency Kenneth?\\" as you couldn't turn on MTV, VH1, or the radio without hearing it when the album was released.<br /><br />The sound is turbulent and the lyrics are enigmatic, sometimes borderline ridiculous, but that's part of what makes this album so great.  This is the sound of a band enjoying playing together, which must have been very cathartic after the intricate production that went into the previous album.  Some of AFTP's songs boasted guitar parts alone in the double digits, so I imagine this album to be their way of blowing off steam after such a labor of love.  In the process, they created an album equally as engaging, just for different reasons.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|A must-have for your DVD collection - likely one of the top 100 films of all time - even the soundtrack is a treasure!
B000WTNCQS|5.0|If your keen on seeing the nitty gritty the ins and outs of U2 in their \\"glory days\\" then this is for you. The remastered CD is simply easy on the ears. And the B side songs well they are just that; B Side songs. There are some moments of glory but B sides are called that for a reason, but U2's B sides would put Coldplay to shame.    So you need to be a dedicated fan to appectiate this product. However the gem of it all is to see Bono in his youth; his confidence that he exubes as a rock star knowing that whatever he does, suceed or fail, he will be looked upon with admiration by his audience. And as part of his character you see the creedo \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\" come to light.  This is shown vividly in the DVD when he stops the vand at possibly their greatest musical moment for the safety and well being of some audience members.   This charater who is human, exudes not God like character, but the inner strength of a man who cares more for others than his self glory or worship.   I'm glad Bono has gone on to spend his celebrity status for the sake of others. This DVD gives a glimpse of U2 and shows that they are simply shy humans, almost embarassed by their sucess,searching for strength. So enjoy the fun and feel their strength as a band and enjoy heraing and watching the band in their prime.

B000URDEB0|1.0|If I knew that the new singer was this bad, I wouldn't have even bothered spending my money on this tragic ending to a once stellar band. New vocalist is tone-deaf, I swear.. I knew I should have sent in my demo when they were searching, and I very much regret not doing so. I feared that this would happen as soon as Tarja was asked to leave the band.       This is the end of Nightwish. I cannot wait to sell this album, I might just chuck it out my window the more thought I put into it. Musically, it isn't that bad but the vocals are absolutely horrendous. Any true fans of Nightwish must be weeping their little hearts out at the thought of this new downgrade they added to the picture. (New singer)  I bought it in good faith, but was seriously let way way down. Are we heading into a generation with no sense at all? I think so, and the feeling I had for Nightwish will stay with them for all albums past. There really is no excuse for this travesty and I can only hope to grow fond of Tarja's new solo album, but I think it will take some time.  My heart goes out to anyone who heard this album and was also incredibly let down.
1401300529|5.0|{{ASIN:\\"The Coldest Winteris very well researched. Halberstam writes in the best prose style. The book reads as well as a novel. He concentrates on the on-the-ground experiences of the combatants. He describes the complex military manouvers in an understandable way.The only criticism I have is of the maps, but they are better than most maps in military histories. My wife who almost exclusively reads fiction was fascinated by the book. What a tragedy his death was.

0446577391|5.0|Since there have been so many reviews written already, I won't bother giving a plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that this 3rd novel in The Camel Club series live up to the excellence of the earlier two. Taut, intricately-plotted storylines, a complex and sympathetic primary cast of characters, a compelling secondary cast of characters, action and suspense. My one question is the ending. I hope what seemed to have happened at the end really didn't. I want this series to go on.  Reading this novel made for an enjoyable weekend on the patio. Luckily, the weather was nice.

B000SSV8HI|5.0|Disk #1 - Zilker Park, Austin, Texas. the stage was HUGE and so was the crowd. A great Stones performance in 16:9 DTS. My favorite concert from the Biggest Bang.    Disk #2 - A nice Doc about the concert preps at Rio. About the concert at Rio. I was a little disappointed as I have the bootleg of the \\"complete\\" show. The offical release omitted like 4 songs and I figured the offical release would be in 16:9. Nope, 4:3 just like the bootleg. But' did have DTS sound!    Disk #3 - The rest of the world. Even though the film qaulity was more \\"bootleg\\" like in the Argentina concert (was 16:9) the crowd was wild and the Stones performance very good. The China performance was, well those peeps (fans) have a hard time enjoying them selves.    Disk #4 - Haven't been there yet.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|Excellent product.  I've always been a huge fan of the original theatrical release of Blade Runner since I saw it back in 1982.  I loved the \\"voice over\\", something that many people didn't like or appreciate. It put me in Deckard's head.  Since the Director's Cut came out I was greatly disappointed given the fact I couldn't get my hands on the theatrical release in DVD format. Subsequently, I love this new release and its multiple viewing options!  Well worth the money for the true sci-fi and Blade Runner fan.

0887307280|5.0|Even though Michael Gerber's writing style can have a tendency to drive people up a wall with his telling you the same thing over and over and over and over and using far more words than is necessary, read this book. If you are in business or are thinking about starting about business, reading this book no longer becomes an option for you, it is a must.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever failed in business will be astounded as Gerber describes, with razor sharp precision, exactly what went wrong. Here, you will learn how to never make those same mistakes again. You will learn how to run your business instead of letting your business run you.<br /><br />One of the things I appreciate most about this book is how much of what Gerber teaches are the same lessons needed for life itself. In much of what you read here, you could replace the word \\"business\\" with words like \\"life\\" or \\"marriage\\" and the same rules would apply. In fact, as a minister, I employ much of what Gerber teaches here in my marriage counseling. The same principles of primary aims, strategic objectives, organizational objectives, management objectives and system strategies.<br /><br />Even though Gerber tends to ramble, particularly when telling a story, don't miss this one. Your business will thank you.

B00008EY9G|5.0|Although I can understand why some other viewers either hated it or were put off by it, I must say that I haven't seen a movie that made me think so much while watching it since The Sixth Sense.    Hold on! Yes - The Sixth Sense is a classic, Identity isn't, but the truth is I'm glad I saw it, which is more than I can say for most of the other movies I have seen recently.    I must say that halfway through the movie, I started getting apprehensive about how they were going to explain everything, I was actually expecting to get an ending that would have been both ludicrous and off-putting.    It was neither. The ending made sense plus it had been set up well enough at the beginning. They did not cheat! (Have you seen The Village? Now THAT was a cheat!)    To sum up my opinion of the movie - I enjoyed it, it made me think and I did not feel insulted by the ending. One of the few movies I would actually watch again.

006054094X|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. Together with \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" this book creates a world view of how civilizations develop and fall and gives insight into what Americans don't normally believe. Although Menzies creates a timeline of what he believes to be the Chinese exploration of much of the known and unknown world, it is important to take note that a lot of the evidence he provides is circumstantial, but they do in essence make a lot of sense. This is a book for anyone that reads it with an open mind and is revealing in showing how even the modern world could have developed without the explorations of the Chinese Admirals of 1421.
0618918248|5.0|It's a shame that the people who need to read this book probably won't.  Very well written and counters all the standard arguments for god.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Regardless of some of the grumbling about this release, 'Hail To The Thief' contains some of Radiohead's best work.<br /><br />At fourteen tracks however it's overall quality is diminished and the ten track 'In Rainbows' would seem to indicate a lesson learned - not that disc two of In Rainbows contains any inferior material.<br /><br />The band have said that nobody was happy with this record, themselves included. I feel that the omission of three or four of the tracks would have helped, bringing greater focus to the remainder, both for the band and for the listener.<br /><br />For example, the 'Com Lag' e.p. contains the 'L.A. version' of the song 'I Will'. I never really cared for the original version found on 'Hail To The Thief' but the L.A version sounds fully formed and would have been a great addition to the album.<br /><br />Once the 'b-sides' are removed what you have are some exhilarating and incredible songs, the best of which are:<br /><br />2+2=5<br />Backdrifts<br />Go To Sleep<br />Where I End And You Begin<br />There There<br /><br />After four years I still love these songs and 'There There' has been my favorite Radiohead song since I first heard it, only rivaled now by '15 Step' from 'In Rainbows'.<br /><br />'Scatterbrain' and 'A Wolf At The Door' are also worthwhile and some people feel that 'A Punchup At A Wedding' is an essential Radiohead track. So, there is much to enjoy here and the quality, in places, is equal to 'In Rainbows'.
0743298039|5.0|A young, innocent, perhaps even naïve character finds herself in the employ of a mysterious person in an isolated mansion. Mysteries abound -- about her employer, and about things the household is hiding from her.    Jane Eyre? Nice guess, and indeed, Diane Setterfield does borrow heavily from the gothic tradition that gave us such classics as Jane Eyre, or Rebecca,but her creation is wholly modern, with just a touch of the salacious depravity of V.C. Andrews.    Our bookish heroine is Margaret Lea, an avid reader and sometimes writer, who has been invited by the mysterious authoress, Vida Winter, to write a biography. Winter (a pen name) has given numerous accounts of her life, but no two are the same. She promises the young Lea, however, the truth.    And she delivers it -- in all its lurid detail. It would be almost difficult to keep up, if Winter weren't such a firm believer in all stories having a definite beginning, middle, and end (a philosophy I happen to like!). Following the twists and turns of Vida Winter's life as she tells of Adeline Angelfield and her twin sister Emmeline, whom she says died in a horrible fire, and whose parentage is rumored to be incestuous, is horrifying and spellbinding. Growing up in a mad house full of mad people can't have been easy. It seems obvious why she has sheltered under a pen name and behind fictitious stories.    I was simply fascinated by this page-turner of a novel. It is clearly an homage to gothic classics, but I love that it isn't really historical fiction. (Although, obviously, since Vida Winter is telling about her long-forgotten past, most of the action does take place in an earlier time, but still within the 20th century.)    Yet, I loved the book's old-fashioned feel and the use of framing -- which I don't think I've seen in a long time. However, don't be prepared for a squeaky clean novel that you'd give to a younger child -- the story's twists and turns are sometimes lurid, often morbid, and almost always disturbing. While I think it is unfair to dismiss this novel (as some have done) as no better than V.C. Andrews, there is a touch of the Andrews style there. Of course, Andrews tips her hat to the gothic novel in her own way, so perhaps this isn't a surprise. There is enough to satisfy a literary reader here.    This book is simply a rollercoaster that left me all but breathless at the end. While some things were easily guessed, others simply knocked me off my chair. This has to be one of the best books I've read in a long, long, time.

1592332803|5.0|This book is everything you could ever want and more. The recipes are flawless, the pictures are exquisite, and the food is sublime! Colleen Patrick Goudreau left no stone unturned. If you don't LOVE this book, your taste buds are dead.
0596009208|5.0|Just started the book, but I'm really enjoying it!     The authors are correct about the effectiveness of having different methods of teaching, pictures, puzzles, etc. It makes such a difference now when I look at other books. I would definitely recommend purchasing this book to learn Java!...even as a beginner to programming (if you a moderately good w/ computers).     Now if only I wasn't trying to juggle so many things at once - I could knock the book out and finish it.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This film (and the global warming argument in general) is so full of holes that only the most gullible would believe it. Every argument that tries to connect temperature increases to \\"greenhouse gases\\" ends up being based on little more than circumstancial evidence. To make it worse, the British government pointed out that ~9 of the big arguments in this film site faulty statistics. For something that won Gore a nobel prize, you'd think the evidence could at least be based in truth. Go ahead and do a search for \\"global warming\\" on the net. What you'll find is a whole lot of research showing that climate changes are happening (big surprise there; end of an ice age), but what you won't find is hard evidence that actually shows that man is to blame. So next time you think about buying into the hype, go protest volcanos since they put more pollution into the atmosphere than anything man has ever done.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|One of my all-time favorite sci-fi flicks, I was one of those kids that saw Forbidden Planet in the drive-in back in the 50's. Drive-ins were the big deal at the time and first run movies played at them not just the B grade of later years. I was also one of those kids that hid under the seat when the monster 'appeared'. OK I was a chicken. Forbidden Planet has held up amazingly well over the years. MGM gave it a big budget with the best technical staff who got their ideas onto the sets. It remains a very innovative movie, presaging much of what was to come in cinema and the real world. It did miss the move to digital, at least in the 'physicality' of the technology. Perhaps the Krell were so advanced they could hide the digital element with a visually more appealing analog representation of their technology. Anyway its a great movie that should be seen by EVERYONE!

B000UD08HW|5.0|Having long been a fan of Pink Floyd, but not a great fan of Gilmours' last two solo efforts, I bought this film, not really knowing what to expect.    The concert comes in 2 parts: Part 1 starts off with a couple of old Floyd numbers and then comes the whole of the recent On An Island album, complete with the original contributors, Robert Wyatt, David Crosby and Graham Nash (only Jules Holland and Gilmours' wife are absent).    Part 2 is a mix of old and older Floyd material, from High Hopes of '94 to Arnold Layne with David Bowie on guest lead vocals.  There is also a slightly cut-down version of Echoes (all 20 minutes of it), which is the highlight of the concert for me.    The video transfer doesn't really make the most of Blu-rays capacity, but it is cleaner and sharper than the dvd release.  The sound though is superb.  Extras are also comprehensive, including all the tracks cut from the main concert, as well as the BBC Radio 2 Mermaid Theatre concert and a set done for AOL.  There is a making of documentary and an on the road film too.    Overall, the concert is stunning and a must buy for either Gilmour fans (gone are the awkward ramblings of his first 2 albums) or Floyd fans.  Along with Richard Wright, Guy Pratt, Phil Manzanera and David DiStanislao, Remember That Night is a truly great concert which is a Pulse for the 3rd millenium.  Only 2 things are missing from this concert: Nick Mason and ROger Waters!    If you like Pink Floyd, buy it.  If you love them, you'll already own it.    Mike Hill
1400064287|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone involved in constructing messaging for themselves or their businesses that they want people to remember.  Ideas are our most powerful assets in today's world of business, but only if we can make people listen and remember.  Therefore, the authors set out to prepare us to do just that.    This book is extremely easy to read, and well written.  The authors provide relevant research as the basis of their conclusions and give lots of examples to demonstrate their points.  But most importantly you need to be able to implement the ideas in the book if it is to provide any value long term.  To this end, they provide a simple cheat sheet in the back of the book that summarizes the material and makes a very practical desk reference.
0143038419|1.0|From the beginning, I really don't care about her character...who is a   real person.  This is the problem.  She is an uninteresting person.   I don't care that she doesn't like her marriage.  This is not   entertaining, nor is her mental illness which caused her to do a   selfish, rather than selfless enlightenment/ journey.  She could have   picked up where Mother Teresa left off.        Elizabeth G is an annoying person, an unlikable   person.  She may be a great writer, when she isn't writing about   herself.
B000092Q7O|5.0|I was deeply moved by this true story of one man's endurance against the Nazi oppression in wartime Poland.  Roman Polanski, himself a victim of the holocaust, directs the actors in a superb manner.  The special feature interview of Polanski is especially moving.  This should be required viewing by all High School kids to give them a lasting view of how far evil can extend and what good people can do to overcome it.  I liked it better than Schindler's List.
0307387151|5.0|This is an excellently written and throughly captivating book.  It is as good as the movie was visually stunning and well acted.  I really became absorbed in the three main characters.  I read the book in three nights.  It was spectacular!!!!
B00005JN0T|3.0|This movie was unique and entertaining. I know the concept of A.I. is not new, but I like how it was realised in this film. This is by no means a great movie or a real important one, but it was fairly enjoyable and basically what you would call a 'popcorn flick', though a decent one. Will Smith plays the same exact character in every movie so I can't really rate him on his acting skills in this film, but it was at least bearable. The robots in the film were pretty neat, as were the rest of the effects. So, while not completely innovative, it is definitetly watchable.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|The lives of Angela Chase and her friends are written and acted so believably that I feel like I'm in highschool again.   The show responsibly adresses a lot of issues that are now ignored by popular teen soaps.  It's not a show simply centered on teenagers sleeping together and so on, but speaks to family issues and gives context to how it feels to be a daughter, a parent, someone insecure, someone with problems.
B00005M91K|5.0|If you're looking for big stars, they're not here. If you're looking for slapstick comedy; nope, not even close. Neither is there a narrative to guide you into someone else's conclusions. But on the other hand, if you'd like to remind yourself why you're here, what beauty there is in the world, then allow yourself the time to experience this film. I might also add that the bigger the screen, the better. Better yet, see this film, then walk out into the evening and look up at the biggest screen of all; our universe of stars which turn above us every night.

1594200823|1.0|I really loved the Omnivore's Dilemma...for about 200 pages. It is wonderfully quotable and full of very true, very strong statements about how America eats today. I especially appreciated his effort to see all points of view of different aspects of the food we eat, how we eat, etc. He seemed delightfully neutral and open-minded. Then I got to the section about vegetarianism/veganism. He abruptly starts defending meat eating under the pretense that he is \\"exploring\\" vegetarianism. He refers to all vegetarians as \\"animal people\\" and when talking about a hypothetical vegan, refers to the vegan as \\"she.\\" He goes on to strongly and offensively imply that vegetarians are anti-social and alienating themselves from culture. He makes broad statements that have no basis in fact, only in his opinion. He tacks a certain set of morals and ideas to all vegetarians and then goes on to tell say that vegetarians are naive, idealistic, and actually doing more harm than good. At this point I was just SO deeply offended, as a lifelong vegetarian (not an \\"animal person\\"), that I had to put the book down. I was thrilled about so many other parts of the book, but this just spoiled it for me.
B000002JSN|5.0|When I was younger, this band had a poor reputation among adults.  As time  has gone by Led Zeppelin has become the standard by which many bands are  judged.

0689865384|3.0|What I liked about the book:    1. It offers an interesting commentary into society's perception on beauty, which is particularly relevant in an age when people take pictures of Angelina Jolie's lips to their plastic surgeons and say, \\"Make my lips like hers.\\"  It's great food for thought and conversation.      2. The plot was tightly woven and believable.  Westerfeld saved his surprises for the right moments and created a world of extreme fantasy that somehow seemed very real in the context of the book.        What didn't completely sell me about the book:    1. As a female reader, I didn't identify with the character of Tallie as much as I have with other books in which the main character is a female.  I didn't feel like she was enough like me or enough like any of the girls I'd ever met.  It had nothing to do with her being a tomboy or a risk-taker or anything like that, it was something more subtle about her interactions and thought-processes that I can't quite pinpoint.  I think it might've been that she was portrayed mostly in two ways in the book: 1. as the risky, devil-may-care hell-raiser with not a feminine bone in her body or 2. desiring to be a shallow, plastically beautiful, worshipped Pretty.  The truth is most girls are somewhere in between those two.      Anyway, all that to say that she isn't as easy to identify with as, say Meyer's Bella in the Twilight Series.  I just didn't feel like I really \\"knew\\" her by the end of the book.      Overall, the book is definitely worth reading, but those of literary sensitivity should know that it is primarily plot driven and doesn't delve as deeply into character development.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|This was worth every penny.  I had a slight concern when I heard that the quality was bad from another review, but this is simply untrue.  The quality is original, not HDTV.  So it completely is the same show that I watched as a kid.  I am deployed in Iraq, and watching these DVD's made me feel that I was home watching live TV.  A great series.  Still enjoyable.  Timeless relaxation watching.  Don't hesitate.
0525950079|4.0|In WORLD WITHOUT END, Ken Follett brings readers in time to the fictional town of Kingsbridge, where much of the action of THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH takes place. It is now the later Middle Ages and the town has grown. The merchants are prosperous, due in no small part to the work started in the first volume by Prior Philip and Lady Aliena, the sister of the Earl of Shiring and later mother of the future earl. The merchants are varied and the priory consists not just of the monks but also has a convent of nuns, two schools, and a hospital. Philip's vision for what the priory could be has come to fruition, though the subsequent leaders lack his skills. The town is still under control of the prior, but the relationship is somewhat uneasy and becomes even more strained throughout the book.<br /><br />The action revolves around four children who witness a murder. Three of the children have ancestors in PILLARS: Caris, a descendent of Tom Builder's daughter Martha; Ralph and Merthin, brothers and descendents of Lady Aliena and Jack; and Gwenda, a young daughter of a landless farmer. We see the children grow into adulthood. Ralph has a violent streak but becomes a knight and later a nobleman, trying to restore the family's honor. Merthin becomes a master builder. Caris is a woman ahead of her time and has a love of medicine. Gwenda has a great deal of pluck and inner strength that allows her to face enormous hurdles. The Great Plague plays an important part in the story as does the tumultuous reign of Edward II and later his son, Edward III.. Like PILLARS,  readers find themselves immersed in this world of fiction set against an accurate historical background. Like PILLARS, readers also want to find out what will happen and how everything will be resolved when the book concludes.<br /><br />I will admit, I loved THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH, and while I enjoyed WORLD WITHOUT END and read it rather quickly, it seemed to lack the magic of the former volume. The more I thought of it, I did wonder of I had read the second volume first, I might say the same thing about PILLARS. My guess is that most readers will enjoy the volume they read first, whether it be PILLARS or WORLD, believing it to be better than the second volume read, the reason being the similarities between the two volumes. The basic plot is varied, the town. the people, and conflicts are not. Some reviewers have commented that the material in WORLD WITHOUT END is somewhat repetitious, noting the similarities between the romance Merthin and Caris in WORLD with that of Jack and Aliena in PILLARS. For me, since Merthin is a descendent of Jack, the similarities work and it would only follow that he'd be attracted to a similar woman. I'm not sure Caris and Aliena are that similar. Both were women ahead of their time, but in different ways and had different challenges in life. However, some characters in WORLD were too similar to characters in PILLARS. Ralph was William Hamleigh, Godwyn was a newer version of Waleran, Petronella is Regan Hamleigh without the warts, and Philemon was Regimus-- the list could continue with the minor characters. This can work, showing that times can change but people do not, but this may be a detriment to some readers.<br /><br />Just as I could not wait to read  WORLD WITHOUT END after PILLARS OF THE EARTH, PILLARS leaving me with all kinds of what will happen next questions, WORLD WITHOUT END leaves me anxious for a follow up. I'd like to see Kingsbridge after the War of the Roses and during the Tudor age. Religious and political battles would abound and the world would be changing. I'd love to see how the extended Builder decedents manage. Would there continue to be master architects in the family? Would they still be the Earls of Shiring? Would the priory survive? Hopefully Follett has something in the works and since the period of time would be radically different, so too would the novel.of I had read the second volume first, I might say the same thing about PILLARS.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|If you're a die-hard fan of LOTR, thought that The Return of the King was the best movie you've ever seen, and that the music within the movie gave you tears... then you should probably invest in this package. However! if you don't care much for the little bits of music thrown into the movie here and there, then just stick with the plain Return of the King soundtrack.       God bless you Howard Shore!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|These are totally awesome in HD BUT after ordering 7 for Christmas presents, I realized you need a HD player to play them - regular DVD player won't do the job.  BEFORE ordering make sure your equipment matches the product of the HD-DVD.  Several of the HD-DVD's are faulty but Amazon has sent new ones in prompt fashion.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|If you are any kind of Zeppelin fan this one is well worth picking up. In fact if you like rock/alternative/emo etc etc and never even heard of Zeppelin it's even more important you pick it up, cuz these guys did it all and, for my money, nothing new really comes close to the rock magic these guys created in the studio or on-stage!    CD 1 is early days with all the ferocious hits (Whole Lotta Love)   CD 2 is later days post-'73 with a healthy dose of Physical Graffiti (Kashmir)     Purists will note several MIAs including \\"Bring it on Home,\\" \\"Fool in the Rain\\" and perhaps most-egregious of all \\"How Many More Times\\"; however, Page only had 2 CDs to work with and these omissions just motivate you to have the best fun of all and pick up the entire discography and get to know all the B-tracks! One can discern the disco influence in Presence and the stirrings of 80s-style riffs in In through the Out Door. Or you can just buy Zeppelin I and II and blow the doors off the guy in the civic blaring nonsensical bass.     Finally, the best purchase to accompany Zep is the book \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" which discusses the phenomenon of the band and all their dimensions. One realizes that basically any dumbass contemporary musician who throws a TV out of a hotel window, slams an entire bottle of JD before taking the stage, or has a sex orgy with a multitude of hot blonde groupies owes a nod to Zep for starting it all.

1572815612|5.0|I love this deck. I learned how to read on the Rider Waite deck, and when I discovered the Universal Waite, I was amazed at the difference.  All of the colors and details are so much more enhanced with this deck. I have several decks, but really use this one over and over again. It's a classic. I love what the illustrated did to the colors and fleshing out the details, especially of peoples faces.  Using these cards helped me learn very to have very in-depth readings, which eventually led to a career as a professional intuitive. Now, after accumulating several decks, this is still the standard and the one I choose first. Highly recommended.
0307237702|3.0|Nice book if you are into dreams. Presidents need to execute not dream and blow smoke.  I gave it 3 stars (average) because the book serves only as a self-promotion piece (Al Gore would be proud) and it was ghost-written.     While Obama, is Potentially capable of change, he has no chance until he understands the real problems faced by America. The reality is that President Bush's disasterous leadership has caused millions of republicans to register as democrats, myself included.  As the election nears, voters should be asking Obama specifically how he plans to make change. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to take him seriously.      I am sending him a copy of \\"America's Financial Apocalypse: How to Profit from the Next Great Depression.\\"  This is the best book on the realities of America's decline. All voters and investors should read it.  I think the author would make a much better president than any of the current candidates.

B000YPUF9W|2.0|Resident Evil Extinction was ok, I'd watch it again, but I would have to be really bored to do so.  It took too long for the action to start and once it did, there not enough of it. I'm also not a big fan of one the actors that played in this installment but thank goodness that person had a small part.<br />Resident Evil and Resident Evil Apocalypse were much better.  I'd highly recommend those two movies.  Sometimes it's best to quit while you're a head and that is what they should have done.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Before viewing this film last night, this reviewer had little knowlege of Howard Hughes. He may know less today,given the liberties of cinematic biography, but who cares? In an acting/producer/director relationship bar none, \\"The Aviator\\" impressed me as one of the most entertaining films of the modern era. The film's electric pace is reminiscent of some of Frank Capra's best work 60-70 years ago. In DiCaprio, one sees flashes of Errol Flynn, dashes of James Dean, crashes of John Wayne, crashes of Jim Morrison, the reclusiveness of a male Greta Garbo,the political genius of Huey Long, and the aeronautical genius of a true \\"Boy Wonder\\".Just imagine the energy required to meld these themes together effectively. But, Leo manages to pull it off in an acting \\"tour de force\\", which a fellow reviewer descibes aptly: \\"Sorry girls, this guy can flat-out act.\\" The real tragedy here, however, may lie in the fact that modern day medicine may have remedied Hughes' maladies, much to everyone's benefit.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I heard \\"Dance to the End of Love\\" on MPR and thought, wow neat song and ordered the CD. Kinda bluesy, kinda Billy Holiday. Whats not to like there?  The more I listened to the CD, the more I liked it.  Such a variety of instruments, clever lyrics.  Just love the whole thing.  Madeline Peroux, prepare for fame.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|If you love GOOD sci-fi film, as I do, you have to buy this four-disc set or the five-disc set of Blade Runner.  Blade Runner is definitely one of the best, in case you don't already know it, and the collector series is not to be missed.... for the behind the scenes \\"extras,\\" if nothing else.  Is Decker a 'droid?  Which do you like better, the \\"studio ending\\" or Ridley Scott's ending?      Now movie fans, sci-fi fans, and Blade Runner fans can compare Ridley Scott's \\"final cut\\" digitally enhanced and blooper corrected version with the previous theactrical and DVD versions.

I can't get enough of the guitar jam at the end of 'Comfortably Numb'! Bramhall and Snowy White rock!!! (This is by far one of the best bargains at $14.98....!)
0143038419|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read in my life.  It lead me on a spiritual journey and I am not a spiritual person.  Elizabeth Gilbert writes in a very easy to read manner and I love her tales of enlightenment and love.  I have recommended this book to many friends and will be rereading this many times!
0800141849|5.0|I have to agree with the previous person who gave this movie ( film) 5 stars.  I originally saw this film when it came out in 1996- I think.  I say I think because I can't remember liking it or disliking it.  Recently as I was flipping channels, I came across this film .  I became hooked.  In the last few weeks I have seen it several times and bought the DVD to own.  This film gets better and better (and funnier) upon repeated viewings because of all the subtle things going on.  I saw more layers as I watched this film repeatedly.  It is a comedy of errors.  Miscommunication and assumptions are always the obstacles for men and women getting together and this film highlights these elements.  I'm not a Barbra Streisand or a Jeff Bridges fan ( although they are both fun to watch in other films) but I do love a good romantic film and I also love comedy.  This film fulfills both these needs.  It is a film that older people will enjoy more  than younger people.  I think both Streisand and Bridges are terrific in this film- great chemistry. I can see why people labeled this film a vanity project for Ms. Streisand but she  has mastered the romantic comedy genre as an actress AND a director.  I guess men are threatened when a woman is smart and funny ( and pretty).   This is the ultimate fairytale movie.   If you saw it when it first came out please give this film a second chance like I did.  It is a real gem.  Wonderful!
1594489505|3.0|This novel focuses on the lives of two women in Afghanistan from the 1970s through early 2001:  Mariam, an Afghan woman of limited education but a lot of natural intelligence, and Laila, a spirited, and well-educated girl 19 years younger.  Through a series of misfortunes, both end up married to an older man Rasheed, and living in his household as his two wives.  Rasheed is a contemptible individual whose malice is exceeded only by his stupidity.  Needless to say, he and the Taliban make these two women's lives a living hell.<br /><br />This competently written novel feels realistic and offers intriguing glimpses of Afghanistan.  One woman gets to do something heroic, and there's a happy ending - sort of.  I wouldn't call this a bad book at all, but it is one of the most depressing I've ever read.  (I turned each page, hoping the wives would kill Rasheed and make the world a better place before too many more decades trickled by in their lives.)  The fact that the book can bring a reader down so strongly means the author has done his job and proved his point:  the women of Afghanistan have experienced terrible hardships.  But it's hard to read about when you can't do anything to change the situation.  Know what you're getting into, readers.  For those who are curious, I've got a chapter by chapter summary of this book on my Impatient Reader website.

B00004W221|1.0|Recently bought a DVD of the movie Rudy for a coworker in Belgium. The DVD arrived on time, as promised. Unfortunately, even DVDs have the PAL and NTSC formats we used to have for VCRs. I thought that with all the new technology a DVD is a DVD is a DVD, but not so. Even DVDs have PAL and NTSC. Needless to say, it was a wasted purchase as it did not work in Belgium. I did read the product description but there was no mention of the format of the DVD mentioned on Amazon in the product write-up. Can the folks at Amazon please mention the DVD format in the future?
1594489505|5.0|Many times authors try to write about different countries, but are unsuccessful. the places are unfamiliar, and therefore uninteresting to the reader. but Khalid Hussaini has the talent to take YOU the reader to his country. through his discriptions we can identify with the life, the characters, and the situations. For me, Afghanistan was nothing but a forign country. but after reading this, Afghanistan came to life in such a magnificent way, I might want to visit it one day.<br /><br />the plot is so interesting and fast moving, that the reader has a hard time deciding when to take a break from reading. I, for one, ended up forgetting my family for a while and reading it in one sitting.
B000N6UERK|5.0|This movie makes you wonder whats really out there lol. I have never watched it with anyone that has not loved it! Great suspense and action!
B000S88JTS|5.0|My husband is an avid motorcyclist and loves this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes motorcross,motorcycles, etc..
0066620996|4.0|I found 'Good to Great' a fascinating read. The book is peppered with fabulous examples of companies who have achieved greatness and those who haven't, and why.
B000GH2YV0|5.0|This is a story about Maria, I have to say Maria does exist, so this is basically a real story with the names changed and probably some details too.  Anyhow Maria suffered some heartbreak not a big deal really, but she decides that's enough and shuts her heart off, she is just 22 years old, she is bored of the life in her small town somewhere in the countryside in Brazil and travels to Rio de Janeiro where she meets a man who offers her employment as a samba dancer in Switzerland, she accepts, and the book unfolds in Switzerland, however wherever she goes, the life become monotonous. Maria is a woman who has high expectations of life and is no content with routine or mediocrity, the opinions of the people of her town are important to her too, she doesn't want to be a losser, whatever that is in her opinion, she wants to be economically succesful.  She becomes a prostitute while in Switzerland, but you'll have to read the book for the whole story.  What I got out of this book is that people can do crazy things when they get fed up with routines and life doesn't meet their expectations, life can become monotonous and we can become disenchanted with reality, but we can be either constructive or destructive in search for a new meaning in life, however if we do mess up, there is always second chances and the gift of redemption.  This book is not for everybody, its content is very strong.  It does has a positive message, and tips to deal with self destrutive behaviours.
B0013KTGAG|2.0|Thought this film was a complete waste of time.  Did not see the high tone of the film others saw.  Want my space films to thrill me and this left me sitting on my hands
B00003CXB4|4.0|I recently purchased this item from gassga568105 and not only did the product arrive promptly, but the quality of the movie was great.  The Lion King is a Disney classic with memorable characters and art.  I recommend this movie for anyone with children or adults interested in Disney cartoons.
B000ICLRHK|3.0|If you have seen Planet Earth in HD, this movie will disapoint you in terms of picture quality. Don't get me wrong, it's better than a upscale 1080p DVD.     I guess technology is not there yet to convert old movies compared to the ones that were shot in HD format originaly.     Sound is good, DTS HD at 1.5Mb but not PCM 5.1 which is at 6Mb.     If you always push for the best quality and sound this movie is not for you.     If you are a fan buy it.
B000W04S6U|5.0|I own all the Halo soundtracks, the second one wasn't all that great, which is why I was a little cautious about buying this one. Was I wrong, this soundtrack just makes you feel like you're playing the game all over again, it is the best of OST of the 3. It's just great, buy this if you like the other soundtracks.
B0001FTVDQ|5.0|Wow!  These things blew me away!  It is like being brought to a whole new world of audio.  Bass is deep, accurate, controlled, and equal to that of $2000 offerings.  Same in the treble and midrange.  For those who have not seen a graph of the headphone's frequency response, it is pretty much dead center, and puts companies such as Grado and Bose to shame.  However, you must have a mp3 player with good amplification (sorry, Apple iPods degrade the audio) and/or a headphone amp.  I thought Grado was THE right choice, which actually has over-emphasized treble that tries to bring back detail lost elsewhere in the sound spectrum.  When I plugged in HD555, I noticed what the Grado actually did to compensate for its shortcomings, a technique Bose uses as well.  The Sennheiser bloomed with balance, rich, sweet cymbal crashes, life-like roars of the electric guitar, and full, articulation of the vocals.  This sound quality transfers to any genre of music, too, actually.  Provided the recordings are mastered properly, even heavy rock should sound correct.  Other reviews scolded the HD555 for its lack of bass.  This is a result of dynamic range loss that some recording studios due to increase volume.  On a 24-bit audio recording, Sennheiser also soars more than any other major competitors.  The others sound over-emphasized.  Get the HD555 and love it.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I love the album, first of all.  I love the option of downloading music now too.  I had never done it before and once I got the I-Tunes/Windows Media Player preference figured out, it was perfect.  It was cheaper, I had the album in minutes instead of days, and I could start listening to it right away.  If I can download music, you can, too.
B0009K7ROI|3.0|Several john mayall cds have really made an impact on me. The last one with the \\"road dogs\\" band was enjoyable and was hard edged enough to make me think that Mayall was not over the hill, or sloppy as he has been on some recordings. Many artists have up and downs in their career and with a history as long as Mayalls, you are bound to have a few low points. This is apparently one of them.  John Mayall is the master of the roller coaster, one record great, the next a mess, and this is one of the messes.    The hard, sinuous bass lines laid down on the last cd are soft and muted and don;t add anything to this record. Same bass player. Did John school him into his brand of blues and defuse his soul? Not sure.   The lyrics and driving blues of the previous effort are sure not part of this record. For a double cd it is awash in mediocrity. Too bad. Same band, hard and driving on one record, now soft and not a dog bite in this one.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|One of the most inspiring movies out there.  The DVD had nice features of past interviews, etc.<br /><br />Great movie that should be viewed regularly.  We watch this movie every year.  This is one of the all-time best movies ever made.  It is a simple story yet it is a timeless classic.  Even after viewing this movie many times, you still go on the journey of ups and downs in the life of George Bailey.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is one (if not the best actor) of the best actors in history.  Along with the movie, \\"Mr. Stewart Goes to Washington\\", this movie are his best works.<br /><br />The director, Frank Capra, makes films that are positive and inspirational. It is great that we have DVDs available so that we can appreciate his works.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons from a Mother\\"

B000A0GYD2|5.0|People will think I'm prejudice in favor of this series because I did some of the special effects for it. So I'm saying that right up front. Get that out of the way.<br /><br />The reason I picked up this copy at this time is because I wanted to give it to my nephew. He has just turned 18 and I think is ready to appreciate it. About ten years ago while we were working on the effects I was thinking of children like my nephew who were not born in time to witness for themselves the incredible events of the Apollo Missions. Could we capture the feeling? Convey the sense of wonder at seeing the earth hanging in space, alone, fragile, beautiful????<br /><br />Could a child born in the ninties fully appreciate how Humanity moved up the evolutionary ladder in that riviting moment in the mid 20th century?<br /><br />My colleagues and I brought a great love of Space, Science and Exploration to this project. It wasn't just a job. We put our souls in to this work.<br /><br />I've read other people's reactions to this series and I am often brought to tears (not something I do easily). I know we succeeded. And my nephew is a very intelligent young man. I want him to be inspired by this story. I want him to live his life with the same determination, strength and dignity. I want him to be part of the next evolutionary rung.
0321544080|5.0|Well, here it is-- in my grubby mitts...  \\"The Moment It Clicks\\"<br /><br />It's alot of info. but very readable. I initally spent quite some time just browsing through the book, page by page. Now, I'm reading each story/photo shoot. One of the things I'm most amazed by is the amount of work Joe does in studying the background of some of his subjects. Steve Martin's photo on page 105, for example.  Joe writes, \\"When I was assinged to shoot Steve Martin for LIFE, I got my hands on everything Steve-- his movies, profiles, any publicity....\\" (Wow).  (How many times do i just show up &  make my best guess preparations at that point...). Of course, I'm not making comparisons of my prep & Joe McNally-- he obviously is in another league (or from a different planet) of phtogoraphers.  He goes on to describe how he technically achieves this  dual-exposure of Steve Martin. It's very thoughtful and he graciously describes how this can be done more easily on digital cameras that allow for in-camera double exposure. \\"The secret ... is the focus cursors: you want the focus cursor on the eye...\\"<br /><br />So, for each of the hundred plus examples... there seems to be this  pattern of discussing the photo assighment & then the technical description of \\"how to get this shot...\\"<br /><br />There are interesting dissertations on lighting or extended tours of Joe's camera bag, his lighting \\"grip\\" (looks like it would take a  U-Haul Truck to load it all... ). As I pointed out in a rebuttal of a \\"one-star\\" evaluation. Joe has & is prepared to use as much gear as necessary to get the best possible shot. What is encouraging are the many examples of despite having all this gear, his best picture is often taken w/ available light or his back-up camera (picture of Linus Pauling on pg 15, for example). And he explains why that was the best picture.<br /><br />For photog \\"pups\\" (novices) like myself this is encouraging stuff... I'm not sure how the pros will react, but my limited experience w/ pros is that for the most part they are a gracious lot... so I think they will applaud one of their own & his efforts to excite photographers everywhere.part they are a gracious lot... so I think they will applaud one of their own & his efforts to excite photographers everywhere.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I am not a mega fan of bluegrass, but this album has been done so well, it often takes my breath away.  She has included a wide variety of music and musicians who focus on the total sound.  Just excellent.
B0002858YS|4.0|Like an explosion of punk, new wave, pop, glam and disco, the Killers appropriately came out of Vegas. Their music is flashy, often hollow, but when used sparingly, can be a hell of a time. The first half almost never falters, leaving the second half gasping to keep up. Their first single, \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" is still one of the most infectious, exciting and buzzworthy songs released at that time, but it's matched by credibly diverting and noteworthy tales. Sometimes the stories that frontman Brandon Flowers tells are a bit too earnest for their own good, but at least they're imaginative. Even the worst of his lyrical inventions are forgotten in the face of a resourceful musical bag of tricks, notably \\"All These Thing That I've Done,\\" which emerges as the highlight because of its anthemic slow-build and gospel-ish bridge.     It was a lot more fun listening to the album during the first week I had it before they became a massive, over-hyped machine. No, it's not as good as some sang it to be (they were somewhat victims of the same sort of splintered whirlwind that eventually chewed up and regurgitated the Strokes), but you could do worse, including the music that the Killers are churning out today.    Best cuts: \\"All These Things That I've Done,\\" \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,\\" \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" \\"Andy, You're a Star,\\" \\"Everything Will Be Alright,\\" \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" \\"On Top\\"
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album is great. It's as good as, if not better than ok computer, in my opinion. Each time I listen to it, it gets better.  favorite tracks include: 15 step, nude, house of cards, jigsaw falling into place.
B000002KNU|4.0|Debut album for Talking Heads, they were one of the earliest new wave bands, and one of the most well-loved by the arty and punk in-crowd. It's not much of a surprise then that this didn't sell too well. For one, it's a young band still crystallizing their sound and style. For another, despite the disturbing power of the frantic classic, \\"Psycho Killer,\\" it was a minor hit at best, and not an easy sell either. Most (including me) only picked this up after their later success.    Like the band, \\"77\\" improves as it progresses. Unlike their bigger (and better) albums to come (\\"Fear of Music,\\" \\"Remain in Light\\"), the songs on the second half are superior to the sometimes tepid first side. Byrne and crew almost sound reined in and tentative on songs like \\"New Feeling\\" and \\"Happy Day\\" before loosening up for side two. Compare that to the energy in \\"The Book I Read,\\" \\"Pulled Up,\\" and \\"Don't Worry About the Government.\\" For a debut, it's pretty good, but Heads newbies should start with the aforementioned bigger records.    Best cuts: \\"Psycho Killer,\\" \\"No Compassion,\\" \\"The Book I Read,\\" \\"Don't Worry About the Government,\\" \\"Tentative Decisions,\\" \\"Pulled Up,\\" \\"Uh-oh, Love Comes to Town\\"
B000VLOKQI|5.0|This video is amazing. The Who is definitely one of the best bands in the entire world, whether you think it or not. Pete, Roger, Keith, and John compliment each other to form a unique sounding band. Watching this video allowed me to find out more about The Who than i knew before.
B00006L3S3|4.0|After his trouble with the U.S. government and the polarizing \\"Sometime in New York,\\" Lennon probably needed to soften his edges or risk damnation. So while \\"Mind Games\\" isn't exactly a McCartney-esque collection of bubbly pop and love songs, it buries the intent of his tracks beneath \\"kinder\\" methods. There's a Spector-like sheen polished into the title track, interwoven humor on \\"Bring on the Lucie,\\" and a handful of pretty ballads and pop rockers to grab the attention of the casual and/or suspicious listener.     However, of his really good records (this being his third and last), it's easily the least essential and at times as uneven as later releases like \\"Walls and Bridges\\" and \\"Double Fantasy.\\" But there's still more than enough good stuff to warrant a listen; in fact, the casual Beatles fan would probably be best served starting here for Lennon's solo career since it makes a cleaner transition.    Best cuts: \\"One Day (At a Time),\\" \\"Bring on the Lucie (Freda People),\\" \\"Out the Blue,\\" \\"Mind Games,\\" \\"I Know (I Know),\\" \\"Meat City,\\" \\"You Are Here,\\" \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\"

B000GY729M|3.0|Disappointing follow-up to their multi-platinum smash debut, \\"Sam's Town\\" owes less to the synth/new wave/post punk stuff they mined so successfully on \\"Hot Fuss\\" as the emotional epic rockers of the 70s, such as Meat Loaf and most notably (and most obviously) Springsteen's \\"Born to Run.\\" But this is no \\"Born to Run\\" (not even close, in fact) and the band's attempt at maturation and broadening is met mostly with indifference.     Which of these identities defines this band? \\"Hot Fuss\\" was more a collection of good songs than a proper album, but their debut is considerably better than \\"Sam's Town.\\" Since they seem to look to \\"Born to Run\\" as a model, it's a simple comparison. \\"Born\\" was a start-to-finish rock album, but it had the great individual songs to go along with it. \\"Sam's\\" follows that epic pattern, but the Killers seem more confined (even trapped) by the formula, and the tales grow wearisome and bland. It's an interesting experiment, but either it's not what the band really wants to do or it's not what the band is capable of doing well.    The songs have little juice and even less identity. It's a sorry state of affairs when first single, \\"When You Were Young,\\" was a let-down the first time heard and yet remains one of the better tracks on the album. The other hit, \\"Bones,\\" barely registers on the first couple of listens. Even album highlights like \\"Read My Mind\\" and \\"Uncle Johnny\\" wouldn't compete for airplay with their best hits from \\"Fuss.\\" Although this is not a bad album by any means, it still becomes yet another of the dozens of sophomore albums in recent years that fails to meet the promise of a strong introduction. A mixture of overreaching ambition and sudden-fame pretension makes for a bad tonic.    Best cuts: \\"Uncle Johnny,\\" \\"Read My Mind,\\" \\"When You Were Young,\\" \\"This River Is Wild,\\" \\"Why Do I Keep Counting,\\" \\"Bones,\\" \\"My List\\"

B000F48CD8|4.0|Maybe it's Jack White's new band, or maybe it's just a side project. Who knows, who cares--it's Jack White, and we will follow. Pretty much none of the garage punk that the WS exercised, but the bluesier notions are as strong as ever. Has a rather earthy quality to most of the production even while the jarring guitars and noisy organ clash together for some sublimely thick compositions. And even if expectations couldn't possibly be met, there's far more to appreciate here than purists might have feared.    While it can't match the best stuff by the WS, they can be considered in the same vein as Tool/A Perfect Circle--even if it is just a side project, it's almost as essential as his former band, and fans should have no problem lapping it up despite the little differences. (Also like the previous comparison, White/Keenan gets far too much credit over Brendan Benson/Billy Howerdel).     The title track and first single, \\"Steady As She Goes\\" are obvious highlights, but there aren't too many slow spots. \\"Level\\" suffers from comparison to its greatly superior live version and several songs on the second half sound like bluesy Beatles in the \\"White Album\\"/\\"Abbey Road\\" era (and rarely stack up as strongly). But those not expecting to be blown away shall be quietly pleased by the results and will probably find themselves spinning it again and again.    Best cuts: \\"Broken Boy Soldier,\\" \\"Steady As She Goes,\\" \\"Together,\\" \\"Hands,\\" \\"Store Bought Bones,\\" \\"Level,\\" \\"Call It a Day,\\" \\"Intimate Secretary\\"
1416523359|5.0|I enjoy all of Stephen King's books.  I was awaiting it eagerly because of a part of it being printed in a previous book.  While I read it, I kept expecting something horrible to happen.  Just as happy it didn't.  But the anticipation...was great.
B000005RT8|2.0|There's not a lot to say about McCartney's first foray into the 80s other than \\"whoops.\\" Paul tried for a DIY ethic like his solo entry into the 70s, but no amount of synthesizers or discotheque appeal can mask the weakness of most of the material. If he was going for Bowie-esque reinvention/trend-setting, he failed far worse than Bowie did during the same decade.    Actually starts out pretty well with the funky stomp of \\"Coming Up,\\" the amusing \\"Temporary Secretary,\\" and the fun but empty blues ballad, \\"On the Way,\\" but the rest is about as spotty as it gets. If Paul wanted to try a new wave flavor, why not go all the way? Instead, he forces boring and schmaltzy ballads like \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"One of These Days\\" upon us, and we're forced to cringe and wonder just what the hell happened. Nobody expected consistency from Paul, but dreck? You've fallen a long way, Mac.    Best cuts: \\"On the Way,\\" \\"Coming Up,\\" \\"Nobody Knows,\\" \\"Temporary Secretary,\\" \\"Bogey Music\\"

B000002MJ0|4.0|Debut LP for My Bloody Valentine (after numerous EPs) may not be \\"Loveless,\\" but it doesn't deserve to be overlooked. In fact, newbies to the group might be better suited to this one than their upcoming near-masterpiece because there's less \\"certain taste\\" pink noise and more easily identified melodies. It may lack the rewards of \\"Loveless,\\" but its  grace is undeniable.    But this is no simple pop record, and they take the time to explore the reverb and distortion of their peers on oddly effective tracks like \\"No More Sorry\\" and \\"You Never Should.\\" Meanwhile, \\"All I Need\\" floats through with its hazy dream of guitar fuzz, \\"Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside)\\" is exactly as its title indicates, and \\"Feed Me With Your Kiss\\" is something closer to punk or metal than one expects from the band. Unexpectedly, the album's best moment comes from it's most straightforward effort, the driving rock song, \\"You're Still in a Dream.\\"     One would have to be a fool to claim that this is just as important a record as their next, but it was somewhat revolutionary in its own way. Although it lacks the cohesive vision and complete package of their next record, this is the best place to learn about everything that the band was about at that time.    Best cuts: \\"(When You Wake) You're Still in a Dream,\\" \\"Feed Me With Your Kiss,\\" \\"Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside),\\" \\"Nothing Much to Lose,\\" \\"All I Need,\\" \\"Cupid Come,\\" \\"You Never Should,\\" \\"Sue Is Fine,\\" \\"Lose My Breath\\"
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a house with his \\"family.\\" He lives in a world where you go to school until you're twelve, you get assigned a job, and you start training.  When you start having certain dreams you are given a dream to calm them. You may apply for a wife/ husband and the council will give you one. The families can contain two adults and children. He lives in a world with no choices and no decisions.    This book is about decision-making and how to make choices. I have a strong connection to the book because of my family of five. It is hard to choose a favorite part to the book because of how well the subject is enforced and how well it is written. My least favorite part of the book however is the ending because it leaves such a large cliffhanger for you.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes sad books or can withstand them. This is a very well written book and anyone can read it, 11 or above.           By,     Alex Roesch
B00005LMBK|4.0|At first glance, Gorillaz seems to be a novelty throwaway. After all, it IS a virtual band, comprised of cartoon characters, and the music sounds exactly like one would expect from a fusion of Damon Albarn and Dan the Automator: Brit-pop meets hip hop (Brit-hop?). So a side project? Perhaps, but with Blur virtually defunct, what else can Albarn do?     Truthfully, Gorrliaz debut is better than one might expect, and isn't that far off from the musical style of Blur's last (upcoming, then) album, \\"Think Tank.\\" As a result, it succeeds more often when Damon overtakes the production. \\"Slow Country,\\" \\"Tomorrow Comes Today,\\" and \\"M1 A1\\" particularly stand out as winning moments in the collection, not to mention the irresistible groove of instrumental, \\"Double Bass,\\" and the very fun hit, \\"Clint Eastwood.\\" The sensation that you're listening to a debut album is clear; it has all the tendencies of a side project, all the way to the realized freedom of exasperated brain childs discovering an outlet to channel their more off-kilter tendencies. \\"Demon Days\\" is a narrowly better album, but those looking for some alternative hip hop experiments, both Gorillaz studio LPs fit the bill.     Better than the album, though, is the virtual part, including winning creations by \\"Tank Girl\\" creator, Jamie Hewlitt; the music video for \\"Clint Eastwood\\" is terrific.     Best cuts: \\"Double Bass,\\" \\"Clint Eastwood,\\" \\"Tomorrow Comes Today,\\" \\"M1 A1,\\" \\"Slow Country,\\" \\"19-2000,\\" \\"Re-Hash,\\" \\"Man Research (Clapper),\\" \\"New Genius (Brother),\\" \\"Rock the House\\"
0060005424|4.0|Lirael doesn't think she'll ever get the Sight. All the other Clayr have gotten their birth right, the ability to see into the future. And it's not just that. She has always seemed different compared to everyone else. She just can't get a break ever since her mother left the Clayr's glacier home. Until she decides to create a magical companion named the Direputable Dog, that is. They soon discover many secrets in the library of the Clayr and when she discovers her true calling, as the kingdoms Abhorsen, Lirael leaves her home and sets out on her destiny. Along the way she meets many memorable characters, like Samuel, the Prince of the Old Kingdom and son of the previous Abhorsen, and Mogget, a sarcastic, always sleeping free magic creature that takes the form of a cat. Lirael and friends aren't able to relax for long though, as a friend of Sam's is missing and the dead aren't staying dead.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this book to readers of almost any age, especially those between 12 to 18. Garth Nix's first book in the Abhorsen series, Sabriel, was extremely good, but I think that Lirael is even better. It is one of those books that you want to read again and again. The plot thickens throughout the book, keeping you always on the edge. My only criticism is that Lirael's ending is to abrupt, and that the third book in the series that continues the story is almost impossible to find in stores. Also, its cover is so hideous that I have no doubt that,  had I not read a rarer, hardback version, I would have theft it on the shelf. Just be sure no to judge it by its cover!<br /><br />--Celeste McAlpin-Levitt
B000YXMMAE|4.0|Radiohead in the 90s was a treasure, a tonic to the glut of post-grunge and frat rock. They were so heartfelt that they could have been classified as emo without the eye-liner. The passion and urgency of those early records, though, are gone. Ever since \\"Kid A,\\" Thom Yorke and crew have folded inward, taking their artsy ideals to occasionally unbearable levels. The broken beats and haunted swoon vocals were in stark contrast to each other. The arrangements were vaguely unsatisfying, as if culled from previous work to satisfy stubborn fans of the old, yet driven to reach further into the icy stratosphere in a strained effort to distance themselves from the new slew of post-millenium bands that gobbled up \\"OK Computer\\" and wanted to do their own version.    Now that we've heard dozens and more \\"Computer\\" clones, we can't blame Yorke for his pretensions, nor can we fault his insistence to move on. But \\"Amnesiac\\" was \\"Son of Kid A,\\" and a thoroughly inferior sequel at that. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" was even less focused and original, a mishmash of old tendencies processed in the New Radiohead Blender without consideration for its audience. Few people I know liked \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" and for good reason. Radiohead cannot, and will not, top \\"OK Computer.\\" But to remain under its shadow without really trying is a shame.    \\"In Rainbows\\" is a bit of a strange title for a band as moody and cool as this one. It's a densely-layered and provocative record, one that resonates most after repeated listens. The dazzling textures are woven as much by the Greenwood brothers as Selway's drumkit. Blancing dizzying and dreamy pop songs with more aggressive and dexterous workouts seems a difficult feat, but their identities almost converge over each other--sometimes sameness is a curse, but here it's a blessing. Even though anyone expecting arching masterpieces like \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" or \\"Paranoid Android\\" won't be initially pleased, the subdued flair for the dramatic that Radiohead is best known for is at full force on this one. The acid and overreaching doldrums are nearly absent. It's a Radiohead album for...everyone?    Leadoff, \\"15 Step,\\" is all crisp drums muffled under a subdued production (Nigel Godrich is up to his old tricks again...). Individual moments reach up from the static-garbled beat to grab you, but few catch hold. But on repeated listens, it emerges as one of those almost standard-issue track ones. Every band nowadays seems to use that first moment in the record player to either slowly open the envelope and let the listener peer inside curiously, wondering what this brand new toy is, or to kick the listener in the proverbial throat with a gate-charging anthem. The first type usually uses an intro or throwaway for this moment, a look-what-we'll-do-now moment before unwrapping the rest of their tricks. The second type usually puts their first single in slot one and wants you to start pumping your fist immediately. Generally, those of the first camp set out to make fully-fledged \\"important\\" (or self-important) albums while most of those in the second group prefer their albums as collections of new material, smashes and filler both, the work of a glorified singles band. Radiohead will always be of group one. Heck, I didn't even realize they had songs being played on the radio until I caught the music video for \\"Karma Police.\\" Since then, I still don't know. After all, no one talks about Radiohead in the same glowing terms anymore excepting their most hardcore fans and semi-ostentatious music critics. Yet \\"15 Step\\" straddles the two camps, being cool and measured while being driven by a punchy beat that sounds like the \\"now\\" of the sorts of bands that borrowed from this one (Broken Social Scene, Wilco, Postal Service, et al). For the record, I actually ended up liking \\"15 Step,\\" but it's certainly not vintage Radiohead.    Second cut, \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" sets things right. It's what could be classified as a muted rocker, one that could becovered by a new-cult hard rock outfit and be turned into a bland and grimy headbanger. This band hasn't had a song like \\"Bodysnatchers\\" in a while. I missed it. There was a reason, after all, that \\"Creep\\" introduced the band to the world. \\"Nude\\" slows things down a lot; a rumbling and haunting piece of electro-jazz-soul that Radiohead has loved for a long time (and they still do it well, even if it doesn't compare all that favorably to their best efforts in that arena). \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" gets things moving again, with a trembling melody under a crackling glaze, the sound of vintage Radiohead aching to be heard again. It keeps building until around the halfway point before taking a break, but by then, the soft glow of its mellow vibe is working as a contrast, and succeeds beautifully. Count this one as an album highlight.    By then, we realize that Radiohead is melting. In a good way, mind you; dissolving the layers of ice accumulated from having its collective and proverbial head in the clouds for the past few years. This is now a band that seems content with itself. They're not trying to top their monolith record anymore. The ordeal, if not over, is at least on a break. Here we find them just making a record. The material was tested during live shows and the songs, structures, productions, indeed all of it, were picked and pecked at until THEY liked it as opposed to them working at it until they believed that overzealous and starving fans could admire their ambition and audaciousness.     \\"All I Need\\" begins as a frosty dream and ends up a summery joy. Even the \\"time-out\\" of \\"Faust Arp\\" works in conjunction with the relaxed space that the tracklist creates through contrasting voices; it's simple and spare and quaintly forgettable. \\"Reckoner\\" meanders a bit, and is a little too reliant on indolent strings during the second half, but it's a minor quibble (Note: this is a MUCH different version than the early one I heard from a live performance). \\"House of Cards\\" is decent, but fatally overlong, especially as the track that opens up the home stretch to the finish line, despite a graceful Greenwood guitar lick. \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\" is a cure for the sluggish \\"Cards\\"; an up-tempo if sinister track that's easy to admire with its slithering rhythm and evocative growing musical paranoia. And \\"Videotape\\" is a minor key wonder that rivals even \\"The Tourist\\" as being the best Radiohead album closer yet.    Now that \\"In Rainbows\\" has captivated the world in a way not dissimilar to the year-after reactions to \\"Kid A\\" (when that one was first released, it was a thoroughly love-it-or-hate-it affair until initial reactions could cool off), we can imagine a promising future for the group. It had been four years between releases (and Yorke's solo record caused a minor panic in Radiohead fan circles), but they return as strong as they've been since the 21st century began. Does this guarantee great albums to come? Considering the two that followed \\"Kid A,\\" the answer is no. But finding the aging band comfortable in their own shoes again and willing only to make music that they can be satisfied with is a positive harbinger. \\"In Rainbows\\" may not be the masterpiece we've been hoping for since \\"Computer,\\" but it's still one of 2007's best bets.    Best cuts: \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi,\\" \\"Videotape,\\" \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" \\"All I Need,\\" \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place,\\" \\"15 Step,\\" \\"Nude,\\" \\"Reckoner\\"
014240165X|4.0|Stormbreaker is a book about a teenage spy named Alex Rider. He started out being a normal kid, except he was a master in many different fighting styles. He knows how to scuba dive, and even at the age of 14, he can drive. All of this is because of his uncle Ian Rider, who used to a top spy, until one bad mission. He was killed when a contract killer shot him.   Alex Rider lived with Ian after his parents died when he was young. Alex had no idea what his uncle really did. He thought that his uncle worked for a bank. All Alex knew was that his uncle would go on long trips to far-off countries. At his funeral Alex was told that his uncle had died of a car accident and had not been wearing his seatbelt. Alex did not believe this, so he went and investigated. He found what he was looking for, and he knew his uncle didn't work for a bank.   I strongly recommend this book to readers who are 10-14 in age because it does have some bad language and has a large number of pages. Overall, this is a great book and think that all readers that like action will like it. I also recommend the rest of the series to readers that liked this book and other Anthony Horowitz novels.                  Connor McRae
B000002G7G|5.0|Whether it was the maturation of Lou Reed or the departure of bassist John Cale, there must have been a reason why the Velvet Underground's third album sounds very different than what came before. Where melodies once trundled about under the ocean of scraping guitars, now they float to the surface and bounce along above the squall. It's hardly an uplifting album, but the screech and vitriol has been toned down considerably. More accessible? Yes. Less adventurous? Sure. But Reed was always the band's driving force, and the way he embraced abstract pop textures at this time was more rewarding than anything he's done before or since.    \\"Pale Blue Eyes,\\" the band's best song, is a gorgeous low-tempo Reed-ish ballad. \\"What Goes On\\" is one of their most accessible and catchy rockers. And \\"After Hours\\" is an otherwise throwaway track amped up to necessity thanks to a perfectly catchy harmony. Some of Reed's finest writing is on here and the music is often quite beautiful to listen to. Not as revolutionary or influential as their red-throated debut, but an altogether more successful endeavor--by a hair.    Best cuts: \\"Pale Blue Eyes,\\" \\"What Goes On,\\" \\"After Hours,\\" \\"Candy Says,\\" \\"Beginning to See the Light,\\" \\"Jesus,\\" \\"I'm Set Free,\\" \\"Some Kinda Love,\\" \\"That's the Story of My Life,\\" \\"The Murder Mystery\\"

B000GPI2EK|4.0|Anyone who can read knows what to expect from Mastodon. The song titles all sound like chapter titles from a bad, overtly-D&D inspired fantasy novel. The whole thing has a lunkhead vibe to it. But Mastodon is one of the more intelligent metal outfits out there. I'm not sure I agree with the common description of this being \\"thinking man's metal,\\" but it's certainly craftier and more ambitious than the dime-a-dozen generic refuse you can find clogging up, say, \\"Headbanger's Ball\\" (is that show still on anymore?).    They make a valiant effort to switch things up even while remaining firmly rooted in the established \\"super-Sabbath\\" formula. Of course, both sides benefit and suffer. Why would anyone want to hear generic riffs in metal? The genre, after all, is a lot more appealing the younger/smarter or older/dumber you are. But when they push the boundaries with the fuzzy static chorus vocals on \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\" or the wince-inducing squalor of...well, I don't know what the hell that was on \\"Bladecatcher\\"...it is just as annoying. Luckily, their playing is dexterous enough to carry them past the rough patches and inherent sub-humanity of the lumbering beast to craft a respectable and sometimes superlative metal record. Not for all tastes, moods, days, etc. However, those who love to bash heads but do so a bit more discriminately, there's not much better in straight metal today.    Best cuts: \\"Sleeping Giant,\\" \\"Capillarian Crest,\\" \\"Colony of Birchmen,\\" \\"The Wolf Is Loose,\\" \\"Siberian Divide,\\" \\"Hand of Stone,\\" \\"Crystal Skull,\\" \\"Hunters of the Sky\\"

B000XO2R1S|4.0|For what it is, this is just about perfect. The musicians- Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Dave Holland- are first rate. Joni Mitchell makes an appearance and Leonard Cohen shows up at the end to poetize \\"The Jungle Line\\" over a piano improvisation. Everything is done at a slow burn- otherwise it wouldn't have gotten a Grammy nod in the first place. That isn't the natural habitat for jazz.    As a tribute to a great songwriter, well, what did you expect? It is light years better than the TV salute a few years back (with the exception of the Richard Thompson and Diana Krall bits, and the brilliant Cindy Lauper cover of \\"Cary\\"- why isn't that anywher but YouTube?)     Check out the other reviews for the CD, or online. Anybody who buys something because it won a Grammy is just asking for trouble. Besides, it only slipped in because Kanye and Amy Winehouse split the vote. Sure \\"Hissing of Summer Lawns\\" or \\"Courts and Spark\\" are better Joni Mitchell, and \\"Maiden Voyage\\" is better Hancock. That doesn't mean this doesn't have it's pleasures.

0373771665|5.0|Though I've heard nothing but praise for Georgette Heyer, I was very reluctant to read her novels, foolishly thinking that they would be old-fashioned and/or boring. How wrong I was! As far as romance goes, one will be hard-pressed to find a more perfect book than this one, well written and researched, and full of interesting, likeable characters. The sizzling chemistry between rakish Lord Damerel and the innocent, yet smart Venetia puts to shame any modern romance writer, without resorting to cheap tricks like using sex to 'spice up' or 'enliven' their relationship. Damerel and Venetia's love goes far beyond mere attraction, and is both believable and charmingly romantic. Unlike some modern 'romances' in which you are left wondering what the hero saw in the heroine (or vice-versa), there's no doubt here that these two people are perfectly well-suited for each other and will be very happy together. A definite must read for Jane Austen fans, and any person who enjoys historical fiction, regardless of the genre!

0060920084|4.0|The Lost Continent by Bill Bryson is a delightful and funny book about his 38-state road trip throughout the United States.  In many respects, Bryson reminds me of Tony Horowitz (Confederates in the Attic, Baghdad without a Map), although with more of a dark side.<br /><br />Bryson grew up in Iowa, but then moved to England after graduating from college.  Twenty years later, \\"I became quietly seized with the nostalgia that overcomes you when you have reached the middle of your life and your father has recently died and it dawns on you that when he went he took some of you with him.  I wanted to go back to the magic places of my youth.\\"  Having lost my own dad two months ago, I can certainly identify with this sentiment.  The other purpose of his trip was to discover the perfect small town.  He was looking for \\"a place of harmony and industry, a place without shopping malls and oceanic parking lots, without factories and drive-in churches.\\"  Borrowing his mother's Chevette, he sets out across America.<br /><br />Bryson visits cities and small towns, national parks and local curiosities.  Throughout his travels, he regales us with his observations and witticisms.  He gets sidetracked from some intended destinations due to the weather, road closures, etc.  He decides to skip the Biltmore Estate when he discovers that the entrance fee is $17.50 (and this is in 1990).  He bails out on Beaufort, SC when he comes upon a sign prohibiting just about everything--\\"I don't know what sort of mini-Stalins they have running the council in Beaufort.\\"  He is disappointed in a number of towns including Holcomb, Kansas (site of the famous Clutter murders from In Cold Blood) and Mark Twain's hometown, Hannibal, Missouri.  Some places are a pleasant surprise including Philadelphia, although \\"No other city in American pursues the twin ideals of corruption and incompetence with quite the same enthusiasm.\\"  And then there are the places that he finds just awesome.  The mansions in Newport, RI are \\"a cross between a wedding cake and a state capital building\\" and as for the Grand Canyon, \\"no matter how many times you read about it or see it pictured, it still takes you breath away.\\"<br /><br />Bryson's road trip also provides him with a chance to reminisce about his family vacations.  I had tears rolling down my cheeks reading about the \\"bombs\\" he and his siblings lobbed out the window made up of Ohio Blue Tip matches stuck into apples and oranges.  He also reflects on all the changes since he grew up in the US, including billboards and RVs.  \\"RVs are like life-support on wheels.  Astronauts go to the moon with less backup.\\"<br /><br />My only complaint is that Bryson didn't always get his facts quite right.  Lucy Mercer was not FDR's secretary, but Eleanor's social secretary and it's doubtful that they did any \\"rustic bonking\\" at Warm Springs, GA.

B000ZK4466|5.0|Let me say that I've been a hardcore Mars Volta fan since their second album and my previous favorite, FRANCES THE MUTE. I haven't had the opportunity to hear their lauded debut, DELOUSED IN THE COMATORIUM, so I can't compare how the exceptional THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH compares, but based upon the three studio albums I have heard (also including last year's fine AMPUTECHTURE), I believe that THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH is not only the group's strongest, but most cohesive album to date.  All of the prog experiments of FRANCES THE MUTE and the spacey nature of AMPUTECTURE seems better assembled here than on either of those previous albums.  There is more accessiblity with BEDLAM without the group ultimately sacrificing their experimental ruminations. It is rare today in an industry that defines rock by such abysmal groups as Hinder or Nickelback to find a true gem and that is The Mars Volta.  While the 400,000+ copies that FRANCES THE MUTE sold might be the peak for the group which has a small, but loyal fan-base, the Mars Volta continue to be incredibly consistent and the consistency seems to be raised a notch with BEDLAM.<br /><br />There isn't a bad or flawed track on BEDLAM, even if the end of the album doesn't quite hold up as strong as the the ferocious beginning, which is to be expected. The album is inherently funkier, and cleaner, most likely aided by gospel drummer Thomas Pridgen adding his sick drumming.  John Frusciante's guitar once again graces the Mars Volta's fourth studio affair (is he an honorary member?) while Omar-Rodriguez Lopez's music and Cedric Bixler Zavala's edgy lyrics and whiny vocals put \\"the cherry on top of the pie\\". The album opens with the forte ruminations of \\"Aberinkula\\" which is spacey, though not as much so as \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" from FRANCES THE MUTE. It has more form which makes the prog-ruminations of Mars seem more coherent (go figure).  Track dos, \\"Metatron\\" keeps up the pace as does \\"Ilyena\\", which is just a shad less satisfactory than the first two tracks.<br /><br />\\"Wax Simulcra\\" in succession with \\"Goliath\\" are the show stealers of THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH. \\"Wax Simulcra\\" definitely trumps my previous favorite Mars Volta song, \\"The Widow\\". It is radio-friendly (as much as any Mars song can be), but it also integrates all of the experimentation that makes The Mars Volta who they are. It is one of those tracks that you can't stop listening to because it is just so great. \\"Goliath\\" keeps in step and serves as the perfect follow-up, and ingenius production move on the part of Omar. Next, \\"Tourniquet Man\\" is tame but still tantalizing while the groove of \\"Calvalettas\\" will never escape you.  The rest of the album (\\"Agadez\\", \\"Askepios\\", \\"Ouroborous\\", \\"Soothsayer\\", and \\"Conjugal Burns\\") is strong as well leaving no time for boredom or overwroughtness from the group. This may be the first Mars album that fatigue doesn't set in... it is that good.<br /><br />If you are into spacey, psychadelic, experimental, prog-rock/prog metal, than the Mars Volta is for you. If you are a Nickelback fan, you should pass. Overall, I think this album is nearly perfect. 4 ½ stars.n the first two tracks.    \\"Wax Simulcra\\" in succession with \\"Goliath\\" are the show stealers of THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH. \\"Wax Simulcra\\" definitely trumps my previous favorite Mars Volta song, \\"The Widow\\".

1594481717|5.0|The most significant part of the book was the chapter that discussed storytelling and the power of story.  I agree with Pink when he says that storytelling is key to learning and developing empathy.  For so long, the emphasis of the global economy has been on data, numbers, and figure.  They are important, no doubt, but by themselves cannot captivate and inspire.  Story does that.      Another powerful book that addresses the use of story in education and when working with students is [[ASIN:1578864771 Rethinking Adolescence: Using Story to Navigate Life's Uncharted Years]].
B000RJO58C|5.0|This is one of about 5 films that I could watch over and over and never grow tired of seeing.<br /><br />All of the actors/actresses, even those with bit parts, are briliiant. The writing is great - it doesn't really 'drag' anywhere.<br /><br />There are parts that will make you laugh out loud, no matter how many times you've seen it.<br /><br />I recently upgraded to the HD DVD version - the transfer is amazing, and really brings everything out - titles of books on the bookshelves, food in the kitchen scenes, etc. - and all of the outdoor street scenes are simply beautiful.<br /><br />There's a 'change of season' walk (it'll make sense when you watch it) that I'd never really caught onto until I saw this film in Hi-Def.<br /><br />It's a winner.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Really into action movies, All of the Die Hard movies are awesome. The latest was definitly not a let down as matter of fact it was the best one yet. Bruce Willis plays these rolls outstanding.  You can't pass this one by without seeing it.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|I like the full show however the remixes of some of the songs, Celebration Day & Dazed, just doesn't come across as well as the previous versions.  Just used to the original release from TSRTS I suppose.  Black Dog, Over The Hills And Far Away and Heartbreaker have much more energy and are executed better on \\"How The West Was Won.\\" All in all if you're a Zep fan it's always great to get \\"official\\" releases whenever one can.
B000XUOIQ4|3.0|The late 1960s and all of the 1970s were not a great time for Walt Disney Pictures.  This film was made after Walt's death and it shows.  Without his direction, the studio produced some real flops, and this film is one of them.    The Aristocats suffers from the same ailments a lot of Disney films of this era suffered--a painfully slow pace and an aimless, meandering story.  The Jungle Book and Robin Hood both had these issues to varying degrees.  Like both of those films, this one does have some charm and a nice musical soundtrack.  It is also very, very dated.  That might make it a fun nostalgia trip for adults but expect this movie to be sort of boring for children.    If you know that you or your children do like this film, this release is a nice one.  Get it.  If you just want to get a movie for your kids that will be tolerable for you to watch, know that this is not your best choice (try Bambi, Lady and the Tramp or Dumbo instead).
B000YKFJ66|2.0|This movie had potential but the wooden dialogue gave the actors little to nothing to work with.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|I really liked this book. Mind you, I read the first 70-80 pages at least four times to understand what the heck was going on and who was who. Hey, what can I say, it was a book club selection that I made so I had to persist. Once I \\"did the time\\" and figured it out, I really really liked this book. What was so good? The characters, the military characterizations and some of the ideas. After you read enough fantasy, it's really only the characters and the ideas that make a book stand out and this one did it for me. Whiskeyjack (GREAT name), Ganoes, Lorne, Toc, Mallet, Crokus, Rallick, and so many more were goooood characters. Erikson does the military attitude really well. Being ex-military myself, when Ganoes meets the Bridgeburners for the first time, their \\"who the *beep* are you...yeah, whatever...\\" attitude and not really giving a darn because they've \\"SEEN IT man, and you ain't even close to being worth my energy\\" was spot on. So much happened and I was sad when it was over. You never seem to savour the good ones as much as you should. Granted, it's not a perfect story...not sure that any are, but I enjoyed the ride and promptly went out a bought the rest of the series that's out up to Reaper's. Theft. Assassination. Murder. War. Excellent.
B0002VEPRQ|3.0|I wasn't raised as a Disney kid, so I was only peripherally aware of this film growing up, maybe saw some of it on TV a time or two, but never in the movie theatres or from start to finish.<br /><br />Recently, however, my kid and I read the first four \\"Mary Poppins\\" books and were thoroughly charmed by their odd, acerbic humor. So I thought, hmmmm, maybe we should try the movie as well, even though I knew, vaguely, that the Julie Andrews MP was much different than the mysterious faerie-nanny we had come to know from the books. Although the Disney Poppins isn't entirely sugary-sweet, she is much more benevolent and feel-good than the grouchy, cross nanny in the books. Also, though I love Dick Van Dyke dearly, having his character Bert in the film from start to finish is a big change (Bert only appears in two or three stories in the books) and he often overwhelms the rest of the film.  The Banks family is also greatly altered - instead of a spaced-out humbug, the father becomes a foreboding, socially retrograde prig, while the mother (also a space cadet in the books) is made more sympathetic, a foil for the crabby dad. (And the interjection of her being politically active, as a  voting rights suffragette, seems oddly out of place: the books were never about the parents, and they are made much more central here...)<br /><br />There is some innovative animation and creative, imaginative visualizing of the story, but far too many alterations and new material created out of whole cloth to suit a \\"Mary Poppins\\" purist, which I guess I am.  Since we love the books so much, I previewed this film alone, and I think I'll hold off for a few years before we give it a whirl as a family: I really think it would ruin the magic of the Travers text, and replace it with something much simpler, much cheaper, and far less wondrous.

0060555661|5.0|I probably shouldn't weigh in quite yet since I'm only halfway through this big book, but even though I know next to nothing about the stockmarket, I find if I just go slowly, read a section at a time, I'm getting it.  Also, Jason Zweig's commentaries on each chapter and his annotations are extremely helpful.  If you really want to invest in the market, I think this book is a must read even if you hire a firm to do it for you.
1582701709|5.0|For some, THE SECRET may not be such a revelation.  But there are many of us who have never heard this message before and feel like we have, indeed, been told a great secret.  I am among that group.      The author of this book is very open about the fact that the ideas she presents are not new, nor are they ideas she came up with on her own. She has pulled from a great well of knowledge from great thinkers throughout history.  Her mission with THE SECRET is to spread the word.      She uses examples, guest speakers (if you listen to the audio version, which is great) and makes the concept easy to understand and incorporate.  If you're looking for a book that goes into the deep and technical concepts behind the ideas, this probably isn't the right book for you.  But if you're looking for some life changing ideas, I highly recommend THE SECRET.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I've read many of the reviews comparing Sara to Tori, Fiona, and the like, and I have to say-- there's a crucial element missing, and that's emo angst. *sheepish grin* I kid.<br /><br />I would say that Sara needs a little more polish to be as good as Tori (or Sarah McLachlan, for that matter), but she's also very new on the music scene. She'll get there. I happen to think Sara is on par with Fiona and Sara certainly has wider audience appeal than either Tori or Fiona because of the pop sound.<br /><br />When I bought this album I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. It's incredibly over-produced. When I heard her sing live, she completely enchanted me and I didn't want to her to stop singing! She's charming, sweet, lively, and charismatic on stage. She can definitely perform. She tells the stories of her songs, and she sings them with a good (full) band. If you ever get the chance to see her sing live, do it-- but give it a couple of days before you go back to this album, because the over-produced songs will make you cringe.<br /><br />When I heard \\"Gravity\\" on the album I literally got sick to my stomach. It's SO flat and devoid of emotion on the album, and clearly, this is a meaningful song. When I saw Sara perform this song live, she mentioned that this was the song she wrote after her first huge heartbreak, and it was evident in her performance. She literally brought me to tears with her poignance. For the record, there's an iTunes Live Session that has a great version of \\"Gravity\\". Spend the dollar to get it... trust me on that.<br /><br />If you're unsure about whether or not to buy this album, I would say buy it with the understanding that the songs have a very produced sound. Once you dissect them a little, you can appreciate her lyrical talent. She's got a great voice, real songwriting talent, and if you can get over the production aspect, I bet you'll enjoy the album.<br /><br />I will add that I am a highly trained lifelong pianist, and her piano skills-- while they're not perfect, of course-- they aren't as bad as another reviewer was saying. The \\"banging\\" is evident on a few songs, but again I think that's partially production turning too many knobs. She didn't bang like that in a live performance. Granted, that's my only experience to draw from, but as someone who listens closely to piano music... the at times flawed technique really didn't bother me on this album.<br /><br />The only song I skip is Fairytale. For some reason it just bugs me... it just isn't my favorite. Good song lyrically, but the music doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy this album very much and can't wait to hear Sara's next album. She is definitely an artist to watch. In the meantime, this album makes for excellent driving music and it puts me in a good mood. I think my favorite song on the CD is \\"City\\" -- when I close my eyes (not when driving, of course!), this song puts me in New York City in a split second.<br /><br />Buy this album!of course-- they aren't as bad as another reviewer was saying.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|I saw this video reviewed on the \\"CBS Sunday Morning\\" show.  I have to say it's every bit as good as the reviewer said it was.  The wide variety of music Johnny Cash had on his show was unbelievable.  It's quite a treat to see some of these performers in their younger years.  The piece on Linda Ronstadt was amusing and entertaining.  I've shown parts of it to my neighbors and they loved it too.  I recommend it to anyone who loves all kinds of music.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I remember watching her on \\"Still Standing\\" and hearing her sing during one of the episodes and thought great another sitcom kicking off a singing career.  I thought that until it went to her in the kitchen and the hair stood up on my arms and I got that tingle on the back of my neck as the song progressed.    She reminds me of all the old Jazz.  It really makes you wonder what it would have been like to sit in a Jazz bar in Paris listening to Sarah Vaughn or Ella.  When I play this at home it is great to sit with some candles and a bottle of wine while my wife and I just relax and dream of all the old easy listening jazz bars.  Instead of this crazy loud bass music.    It is a great start.  I hope she keeps it up.
B00110K62U|5.0|This is entertainment at it's 100% absolute best.  The music is haunting in it's melodies and lyrics.

B00005JPSM|3.0|If charmed by the previews, or any of the actors, you'll probably enjoy No Reservations.    The storyline is classic boy meets messed-up girl who struggles with her issues and inner angst then falls hard..until..THE CRISIS format. But if you are considering renting or buying it you probably aren't looking for art or plot twists.     There are a few charming moments, much so-so stuff, a little melodrama or overkill, lots of food show and tell but it's a feel good movie and holds its own as entertainment. I actually teared up at one scene, and laughed at a few more.     I loved Aaron Eckhart's character's attitude and playfulness even if he's not completely fleshed out. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays uptight well and her subtle humor adds to the mix. Abigail Breslin gets to exercise her emotional muscles as she hits all five stages of grief on screen.     If you don't expect brilliance and Oscar worthy flick but are looking for warm feel-good almost perfectly clean entertainment you'll not go too wrong. Some subtle sexual overtones and a few off-color comments give it the PG rating.
0810994739|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, in my opinion, is more gut-busting than the first book, and I loved Dairy of a Wimpy Kid. When an 11 year old (son), a 46 year old (Mom), and a 64 year old (Grandma) burst out laughing at the antics of the Heffley's, especially Greg, the humor is droll, superior, and a something that is easy to relate to regardless of age.  It's also a book that can be read, and laughed at, multiple times. This especially makes purchasing it a bargain.  How about buying two and donating one to your elementary, or middle, school library? The librarian, and students, will be delighted.

6300268985|4.0|Oh b'gosh 'n golly, this film is chock full of treats both visual and aural. Given what happens in Princess Carolyne's antechamber, I think we can safely add olfactory to the list as well.    Okay, let's try a little experiment: I want you to think of the most excessive movie you've ever seen. Now, what would it be like if it were twice as excessive? You're not there yet. Make it -more- over-the-top. Getting close.    Ken Russell's Lisztomania makes Ken Russell's Tommy look sedate. It makes any Derek Jarman film seem frightfully low-key. But it also makes you want to watch it again and again.    Who says there's no spectacle in showbiz any more? You've got Roger Daltry as Franz Liszt whooping it up in Princess Carolyne's abode to the male organ while his past lovers dance the Can-Can or something. And then they do this maypole dance with Liszt's own member which is so grotesquely enormous it should have windows and a door.    Rick Wakeman--RICK WAKEMAN--plays the comic book hero Thor! He is a truly revolting looking human being, and even more so when decked out in that Jill Masterson paint from Goldfinger. Liszt and Marie d'Agoult's husband have this bizarro swordfight set to a country and western version of Hungarian Rhapsody that ends with Franz and Marie stuck in a piano on a set of train tracks and something else happens and... who knows.    Who knows indeed!! Who knows what the heck this film is supposed to be about. Wagner is portrayed as Liszt's friend and mortal enemy. The secondary action (the main action is between Liszt and da ladeez) revolves around an epic battle between Wagner's secular humanist music setting a template for the rise of Nazism and Liszt's... uh.  That's where I get confused. I think it's just Liszt's lovely music.    With Wagner we get hit over the head with Nietzchean themes of the Superman. With Liszt we get the idea he kinda likes to play piano and he really digs getting it on with da ladeez. Mighta wanted to be religious at one point.     Honestly? Wagner's the cooler character. I dig his Nietzche sailor's cap. Oh, and he gives the wildest parties! Dude's laying of the foundation stone at the Bayreuth Festival TOTALLY ROCKED! Admittedly, it seemed to actually happen in Wagner's Castle Grayskull/laboratory, but hey.    But hey, indeed. This film is an absolute mess of nonsense taken to epic proportions. The storyline is, unbelievably, more or less accurate-ish. At least, when you strip it down to the bare minimum. And yes, I do mean the finale--that really happened. It's why we live in a free country now.    Thank you, Liszt.  Thiszt.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|This version is very slow, but highly effective.  The directing is spot on in transferring Austen's novel to screen.  Modern day version's are compelled to change history in having actor's physically act out their emotions.  In that era, a look, a sigh, a hesitation spoke volumes.     Spoilery - Ciarin Hind's Captain Wentworths' look over a wineglass, his controlled but pained look after touching her when helping her down off the carriage and then his look when dropping off the letter, screamed that he still loved her!  I think Jane Austen would be proud to have this in her movie viewing collection.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Though \\"Papillon has been out for quite some time, it has remained one of my all-time favorite Steve McQueen films.    The film, although not true to the book by any means (which I thought was a terrific page turner), is still an exciting one. It concerns one Henri Charriere, convicted of a murder he didn't commit, and was sentenced to the Bagne (prison) in French Guiana. His nickname is derived from the butterfly tattoo on his chest, which becomes an object of attraction in the film.  During his term, he tried to escape no less than five times (though the film concerns itself with only three), and was successful on his last attempt. He died on July 29, 1973, a free man. The privations and obvious dangers of the South American bush are laid bare, and the dangerous behavior of the cons there make you wonder if French authorities were right in sending these men so far from French shores to protect it's citizenry from them.    The acting of the principles is first-rate, and many went on to other films and projects because of the popularity of the film. Charriere, himself was advisor to the film, and the actual prisons at Saint Laurent and Saint Joseph were cleared of their overgrowth so there would be no need to build sets (you get to see them, before the work commenced to clear them, at the end of the film, just before the credits).    A number of curious things happened after the release of Charriere's book. Two other books were released in direct contradiction to certain claims made by Charriere. First, that he actually DID commit the crime for which he was convicted, and second, that he could NOT have done all he claimed to have done. Then, in 2007, a 104 year old man died, having claimed to be the REAL Henri Charriere!    All that notwithstanding, the film is great! There is a special feature on the making of the film, with some shots of Charriere. Excellent classic! A must-see for any Steve McQueen fan.

B000000W6F|5.0|IMHO this is the best Smashing Pumpkins album - I listen to it more than any of their other albums, all of which I like too (except for Adore and on).  Recorded very early in their career, it's a little raw, edgy, and just pure Smashing Pumpkins experimenting with their trademark sounds.  It's almost like the sketchbook for Siamese Dream, so if you like that album I would buy this one, too!  A must for any Smashing Pumpkins fan!  And look - Billy Corgan had hair - that tells you how old it is!
6304806418|3.0|The early development of Evita to her final role is slow and tedious.  I am not fond of Madonna, but her performance was very good.  The DVD did follow history very well, and some of the scenes were remarkable.  Of course the famous song, Dom't Cry for Me, Agentina raises this from a three star to a four star film.
0316067598|5.0|Once you get into this book it does read like a thriller that you can't put down.  In parts I laughed and other parts cried, and it's an important story and a great book.  He does tend to bash the liberal media as they can't possibly know what its like to be on the front line.  Although I'm liberal in some respects I support our troops and recognize and appreciate their heroism.  This book made me appreciate them even more, and it's incredible what a Navy Seal goes through - you marvel that any human could even get through the training.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is an old movie but a good horror movie for young and old fans.  Stephen King is a master mind when it comes to character development and his characters are captured perfectly by the young Sissy Spacek, John Travolta and the many cast of characters in this movie.  You can not help but feel sorry for Carrie (Spacek) while you fear her as she struggles with the trails and tribulations of today's teen geek while dealing with a whack out mother/ Bible Thumper (no offense tended to all of us religious folks) at home.  After watching this movie, you will have a few choice words for the mother of Carrie in which can not be put in this review.  In fact, you feel for Carrie as the real villian of the movie is Mom.  The acting is great from all angles to the bullies, the teachers, Carrie, and of course Mom.  My favorite line in the movie is \\"The are all gonna laugh at you!\\" from the hysterical Mom.  A must watch for all horror fans and Stephen King fans alike!
B000NA28A2|5.0|Larga fue la espera pero valió la pena. En este album tenemos de regreso al mago que nos hizo vibrar con [[ASIN:B000003MZU Bachata Rosa]]. Sencillamente una delicia. Todos los elementos están presentes: la genialidad rítmica y melódica, la ternura, la suave poesía que insinúa más de lo que dice. La música que fluye con perfección completa, como verdad orgánica que surge de la inspiración auténtica, donde prevalece el sentimiento real transpirado por un artista que siente lo que canta, un logro poco frecuente, que recientemente sólo he encontrado precisamente en discos como el presente, y en el brillante debut de Shery con su album [[ASIN:B000XXDWVS El Amor es un Fantasma]].  Que me des tu cariño, por ejemplo (track #4 de \\"La llave de mi corazón\\"), es una canción que acaricia los sentidos no sólo con su letra, sino con la forma brillante en que está construida: las deliciosas percusiones, finamente integradas con el resto del arreglo, el ritmo de bachata siempre presente, pero sin estorbar. Una canción 100% dedicable, símbolo de un album BIEN pero realmente bien hecho, donde Juan Luis Guerra regresa a ocupar el trono que le pertenece por inspirado derecho.
B00102FELM|5.0|I just finished watching the new Scorpions live @ Wacken 2006 DVD and was totally-totally blown away!!!  Great production, sound quality and camera work. The band and song selection was top notch and Klaus Meine's Vox are clear as a bell and stronger than ever!  I've seen them live 5 times over the last 25+ years and they've never EVER sounded or been better than this!!!  The only disappointment I have is that I really wish they had turned up the levels a little more on Uli Roth's songs and solos. ***Spend the dime because this is an absolute MUST for your DVD concert collection!  Trust me, you'll thank me for it!!!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The ultimate version of this film in blu-ray offers the best quality ever of a classic film.  It's a must have in every sci-fi film collection.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|First heard OneRepublic (Ryan Tedder, Zach Filkins, Eddie Fisher, Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown) when they five member group was featured on Timbaland's \\"Shock Value\\" on the track \\"Apologize\\" (Remix), my favourite track on that album. The Colorado band delivered something special with this unique track, and Timbaland's production was on point, while lead singer Ryan Tedder shines lacing the track with some memorable vocals. Nice to see OneRepublic get the recognition they deserved for this track when it blew up worldwide. \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" is an impressive thirteen track release which features two versions of \\"Apologize\\", the album's first track \\"Say\\" (All I Need) is an excellent cut, that vibes real well - found myself liking this one as much as the lead single. OneRepublic incorporates more of their rock sound on the follow up track \\"Mercy\\", while the second single \\"Stop and Stare\\" is another standout track, feeling the chorus.   \\"Goodbye Apathy\\" has a somber OneRepublic saying goodbye to a state of indifference,  while Tedder sings soulfully on \\"All Fall Down\\" & the grave \\"Prodigal\\". Timbaland's & Tedder's production is another highlight of this release, track after track of memorable beats. Other track's that standout for me are two cut's produced by Ryan Tedder - the love ballad \\"Won't Stop\\" & powerful \\"Come Home\\". OneRepublic provide an enjoyable album with \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" - feel good music that vibes well.
