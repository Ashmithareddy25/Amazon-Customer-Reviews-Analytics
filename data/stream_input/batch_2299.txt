B00AFEY354|5.0|I received the order in plenty of time to give the DVD as a Valentine gift.  My daughter was thrilled.
B00A27NN50|4.0|this is the beginning. essentially it is like reading how to book. this movie sets the tone for Woody Allen's entire career. Diane Keaton is great, Paul Simon is perfect in his role, If you've liked any Woody Allen movie or enjoy Rom-Coms that aren't overly sappy you should DEF watch this
B000HA4WT8|5.0|I was watching all the Fast and Furios movies getting ready for the new release. This was the missing puzzle piece.  It was fun to watch.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|great flick, can't believe I hadn't seen it entirely until now. Matt Damon is creepily excellent and Jude Law is great.
1616550414|5.0|And Link, not much else to be said, said the fanboy. If you're a true Zelda fan, you'll want this book, it's pretty interesting stuff and sort of works as a nerd mantle piece.
B00A0SO4S6|4.0|I liked it a lot. It is very good.... It's 14 years-old check wikipedia or imdb for for reviews.  But def worth the watch
0802473156|4.0|This book was a simplified outline of what it takes to really understand the partner you are with. It allows for a conversation in a direct way that hopefully can offer freedom in loving someone in the best way possible.
B008Y6SLL2|2.0|It's hard to understand how these great actors all chose this flop. It is soooo slow. It has a great premise but you never leave this tiny office, there is no perspective or action. It is like watching a car that starts and shuts off, starts and shuts off.... I couldn't finish it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|You pay for this game but you don't get all the levels. You have to pay to open the rest of the levels and that is retarded you should not have to pay for the game more than once. And that sucks cause its a very addictive game and I absolutely Loved playing it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|my seven-year-old granddaughter loves the story and music of les miserables.  my son took her to see it in the movies and texted me that she was sitting there &#34;bawling&#34; when fantine died.  i thought it was niced that a seven-year-old had empathy like that, but that maybe she was a bit young for this tale of wretchedness.  being a former french teacher, i sat with her and we discussed all the various themes of les mis.  i told her that i ordered the dvd (one for her, one for me) and she was so excited she called me the day after it came out to see if i had it yet.  i told her it had just arrived and she came right over to get it.  so last night, at 9:30 PM she and i watched it together.  she knew the whole story and even asked some very astute questions. truthfully, seven is young to watch this but some children can handle it.  she sat riveted once again through the enitre movie. as for me, i wished for more, more, more but it's still good.  i loved the broadway production better, though. too bad it's gone, but this movie is the next best thing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was addicted to angry birds for a long time now its my kids who are addicted. Buy it for your kids or get the free ones either its fun. And its so very worth it.....you kids will focus so well while playing this game. :-)
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love the tv show,and love this as well different but just as good will be getting the other volumes for sure
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love using the pinterest app on my kindle it keeps my scrap booking under control Lol. Use it enjoy it and share it. Way cool app!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My son and I just watched this movie. We were stunned at its depth and cinematography. There is a bit a of a twist, however, and I think it makes people think with both sides of their brains. Which side did you think from?
B007VUCAVO|4.0|works perfectly just like the description says.with smartphones sucking down the juice of my battery it is a useful tool for letting you know how much battery is left.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful!!!! I loved this book so very much. It was exciting, sad, happy, and scary. I am in love with Alex and the kids.
B003Y8YXEO|5.0|It's been a long time since I sat and listened to the power of John Lennon's words and intricate melodies.  This CD is one not only Beatles' fans will love but anyone who wants to feel the story of that generation.  Finding this and many other treasures keep me coming back to Amazon.com for my selections
B00933JL0A|5.0|I been looking for a game like this, it reminds me of stronghold for the pc but without having to worry about being attacked. Very entertaining game and would recommend it if you like town builder Sims
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|The kids might like it, but in my view I would save the space and download time for something else!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I have to admit this is going to end up being a game I get addicted to I have only had this app for about an hour and can't seem too get off of it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE FLOW FREE!!! ITS SUCH AN FUN GAME!!!!!!!!! WHEN IM BORED I GET RITE ON MY PJONE AND PLAY FLOW FREE!!!!!!!!!! WHO EVER CREATED THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!??!?:):):):):);(;);)<br />ITS FREAKN AWSOME
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I find it hard to pinpoint what it was about this book, other than the writing itself, that got me started.  Being something of a bibliophile (within the limitations set by my shelf space and finances), the word &#34;bookstore&#34; and the mysterious-sounding name, Penumbra, got me to look at the book's summary.  Secret society?  Programming?  A quest of some kind?  Not quite sci-fi, but sounding almost like it.<br /><br />There!  If that didn't pique your interest, then you are unpiqueable; look elsewhere.  If you can deal with a modern, technologically-advanced adventure with mystery, adventure, and suspense, then by all means check this out.
B001P3SA94|5.0|The movie was excellent.  I'm a huge fan of Etta James and Beyonce did a phenomenal job portraying her.  I have recommeded this movie to family and friends.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I read through all of the negative posts and I have not had any of those problems, I find it an amazing little app.  I use the notes and calendar almost daily without problems and it updated today with no problems.  To bad for others that have been having problems.  It may be related to the hardware - I use mine on a Samsung 4.6 player.<br /><br />I tried numerous notepad type apps and found all lacking in some respect till I found this one.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A little slow in parts, but definitely worth a read. Great unfolding of a story that crosses generations and continents.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I'll just say I loved the movie. Probably because I lowered my expectations on the vocals. I was pleasantly surprised with the actors that played Eponine and Gavroche. She has a musical quality voice and he sounded like the original (I was disappointed that Little People was not included). Hugh Jackman did a pretty good job, not stellar, but very good. To appreciate Anne Hathaway, you have to watch the movie. Just the voice without the visual does not capture the brilliance of her performance. Eddie Redmayne as Marius was good and can sing, I'm just not a fan of his voice, which sounded kind of froggy.  As for Russel Crowe as Javert, he may kind of look the part, but what a horrible choice. Next to On My Own, Stars is one of my favorites, but with Crowe singing it was cringe inducing. My favorite recording is the 1985 London Cast. Listen to the Javert on that one and you'll get my point. I think I'll stick with the movie to have the visuals to go with the vocals. If I want just the music, I'll stick to my London cast recording.
B000SEH80I|5.0|I especially appreciated the excerpts from real therapy sessions and reading the stories of other people who have dealt with toxic parents.
B005K17RU0|1.0|worked fine. Apps was updated and it looks like all other apps. Why do they constantly change things that are working just fine. Maybe related to online site that is always updating and ruining everything.
0061950726|5.0|What an engrossing story \\"Orphan Train\\" is, following the intertwining stories of Vivian (formerly known as Niamh and Dorothy) and of Molly. Vivian is 91 years young, lives in a mansion and seems to not have a care in the world. Molly is a 17 year old Native American foster child, in trouble for stealing a book, and almost old enough to time out of the foster care system.<br /><br />In alternating sections of this story, Kline tells a lyrical tale of just how alike Vivian and Molly actually are. It seems fate brought these two needy people together so that they can identify and learn from these similarities and also help each other.<br /><br />I have always liked different stories I've read about the Orphan Train movement and truly enjoyed Kline's depictions of Vivian's Orphan Train experiences.<br /><br />NOTE: Be warned that there is one graphic sexual abuse sequence in the book.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John always writes a good book, but when you can go from Ohio to the Consu in one book you have to be GOOD. This is a future that I had never imagined and believe me I have an active imagination. Buy the book you won't regret it.
0064430170|5.0|I feel like this is a brand new copy of my favorite book from childhood. The colors are vibrant and I love that it is in the larger size - just like when I was a kid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|why  not\<br /><br />it is a  fast paced game that is never the same<br />could use a litlle more instrutions on how to play
B005RZB65Q|5.0|It gives wonderful insight; makes aware how we (parents) have so much to learn in order to rise up our sons successfully.<br /><br />I like the practical way to describe the effects of praising in children (and all), and hte exemples, data , and answers to included questions.<br /><br />It's very useful for parents and teachers..
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A good read read well worth the effort to wade through. Recommend to read for the holidays. A story of faith,hope,forgiveness,love,love lost,heroism,everything!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album is a cure for the C O double M O N. Their sound is unique and will draw you in. I heard Fitzpleasure on satellite radio and liked it. I was curious and went ahead and purchased it based on the reviews. I've been burned many times doing that, but not this time. I listen to it all the time. The whole CD is great (Matilda is kind of annoying). If you enjoy one of their songs, you'll probably enjoy them all. There are only a couple of songs I skip, and that's really just because I'm impatient and want to get to the ones I love, not because they are bad. My favs are Fitzpleasure, Bloodflood, Something Good, Tesselate and Taro. Can't wait to hear more from these guys.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book, just like the first two, has lots of twists and turns. Also, I like that they change some of the points of views when they go to knew books. It adds a whole new angle to each book. If you liked the first two you will also like this one!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|works great on my kindle fire. a few minor differences between the app and the website but easy enough to figure out. it helps fuel my addiction.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book and look forward to the continuum...was a tough book to set down, so time flew by as I started last night and subsequently finished this morning.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Everyone is saying how it Solis difficult to fly a plane... How do Ai get one? Of all the months I have played this... Never seen a plane.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|The only annoying thing about this book is that I now, again, have to wait until the next book is written and published. Otherwise Archer has again written another book that I could not put down until I had finished it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!! Whenever I'm feeling down I just go on Pinterest and hit humor. It always makes my day!!! :D
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I loved this movie! Great acting, kept my attention and I kept thinking about it even after it was over.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love how I can use so many effects and all the packages for free! Its a pretty good app! I would definitely recommend it.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Loved it,for a little device like the kindle,this movie looked great and the sound system so powerful,I'm very pleased,Thank you.
B006WJ0332|5.0|LOVE OTH THAT IS ALL! BEST TV SHOW EVER! MY FAVORITE COUPLE WAS ALWAYS LUKE AND PEYTON BUT TOTALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH BRULIAN!

B008OOYALE|5.0|LOVE THIS TRULY AWESOME GAME... NOTHING BETTTER!DRAGONS ARE AWESOME IN THIS FANTASTIC GAME! ONE STAR REVIEWS ARE FAKE. GET THIS GAME.WOHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I liked this movie.  Visually it was really impressive.  The story line was also good.  The kids really enjoyed it too.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I use the SB400 flash as supplementary bounce flash on a Nikon D800  when mobile. I am a retired professional wedding and portrait photographer.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Received this very fast.  Have always been a Hitchcock fan, and this is Hitchcock's BEST.  If you have never seen this movie, you have to get it.  It's a classic that only gets better with time.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The game is very fund, addictive and easy to learn, which is worthy of 5 stars..  My kids and I both play this game a lot .  However, don't wast your money on the in app purchases because it takes your money without delivering the purchase into your account.  We haven't found anyway to get help with this either.  There is no obvious link on the Amazon website or on the app itself. For this reason it only gets 3 stars.
B00121QGUY|4.0|I like the movie, but I chose 4 stars b/c there are other movies I would rate above this one. I enjoy the music, but parts of the movie could have been better. No complaints really. I think it is a very good movie. I had no problems with the seller and received the dvd in good condition and in a timely manner.
B0014KFM2Q|4.0|They sound great after such a long layoff! The DVD to this record is very good as well ........Buy it you will not dissapointed
B009R5GR1K|5.0|So handy! We especially like the pronunciation recordings for the unusual, difficult (or often mispronounced) words.  The ads in the free version were often risque, and made the free pages messy.  Buying the \\"ad-free\\" version fixed all that - and it's so inexpensive - just skip the free one. We also enjoy the home page with options to customize relevant information and games! Thanks!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I've been a fan of this group from the start.  Each album is better than the last.  I thoroughly enjoy Native...wonderful arrangements and amazing, complex lyrics.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!!!! I have dimond evrething I just can't wait untill they add Redstone  stuff!!!<br />You'll LOVE IT so get it!!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|As good as ever! Great lyrics, and an even better follow up to their last album! Check it out if you haven't already!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|It's all about marital problems and how stupid they both are in trying to rectify them. Too realistic to enjoy.
140131046X|5.0|Another great read by Mitch! I think I have yet to read one of his books that hasn't been touching and tearful, but in an amazingly positive way!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I found this surprisingly OK to watch. More toward the teen type movie, but not that bad considering. Kind of on the order of a super hero/love story type thing. I'm thinking it may have a sequel at some point. Sometimes good to watch something out of the ordinary.
B00138KKP8|5.0|If you aren't familiar with Ray Lamontagne, I suggest you check him out. Powerful voice, and I never get tired of listening to him! This is also a really great album
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|It is very sex oriented and I can't believe it is even shown in movie theaters. Only couple of funny parts. I hear more bad comments than good about this movie. I wouldn't waste my money on it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This dvd help incorporate strength into my regular running routine. after completing the dvd i noticed i could run up the hills so much easier and with less effort! I feel so much stronger now and continued with the kick boxing dvd and now on ripped in 30 which I'm obsessed with! I look forward to doing her workouts every morning. The workouts fly by and are actually really fun! I love Jillian!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very enlightening. The doctor makes a good case for life after death. It helps to pretty much confirm what many, many other people have said about their near-death experiences.  He seemed very sincere in what he writes.
B000B63IEI|4.0|The music's emotional appeal is undeniable, and Andsnes plays it in a full-throated yet sensitive manner that is sure to win it even more friends, the melodies rising higher as the piece goes on.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. Starts out easy and gets harder as you go. Great for the kids, but the adults have a good time with it too! Not always as easy as it looks. Another great mind game.
B00130VLZ4|4.0|Soft case that holds its shape, decent quality.  However I had to return it because it will NOT fit a T4i with 18-135 STM lens. This is a misprint on the Canon website and I have notified them. I ended up ordering a [[ASIN:B00390JT1O Lowepro Toploader Zoom 50 AW (Black)]]. Maybe the [[ASIN:B00BW6LZSM Canon EH24-L Semi Hard Case for EOS Rebel]] to be released on 4/30/13 will fit?
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I found the acting OK, but it was about your typical love story of the time period. Not so different from today's  so-called romances.<br />I'd think twice about buying this movie.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I liked this book.  It was very well laid out.  All of this info is available online, but it was nice to have it all in one place, step by step.
B0000022WA|3.0|I was kind of dissapointed because I thouhgt it was a CD not a VHS. I have not been able to play it yet though the delivery was fast. It did not specify what type of tape it was.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So good I couldn't put it down! A must read for sure. I can't wait to get my hands on the next one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel is very well crafted, authentic legal details, well written.  It did tend to lose stream the last few chapters, once you figured out whodunit, etc. But well worth the read.
B00BI5IXL4|2.0|A lot of patience is required to watch this movie. I would suggest watching half of the movie, take a break, then watch the rest of the movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Amazon instant video work well and the quality is great in SD or HD. I like the selections and will be buying more. Season 3 starts in 3 days..cant wait!!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Made the process of switching from Google Reader effortless. There is a feature that  makes recommendations based on feeds that you subscribe.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones is the best!! Amazon instant video work well and the quality is great in SD or HD. I like the selections and will be buying more.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Just a great all around game.  Can't believe its free. I highly recommend.  The graphics are really impressive and the game is very challenging.<br /><br />Steve
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Love this movie and when I saw this edition come out I grabbed it.  It has the extended dvd's in it with added features which gives you hours of added fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|More video/TV effort should be spent on shows like this one.  Most commercial broadcast TV is throwaway stuff with rarely any redeeming grace.  I will watch and absorb this offering more than once.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome game..... play it all the time and never have any problems... just wish u could get more then 60 seconds....
B007M45PMU|5.0|Very good band, very good album! Check out their YouTube videos, these guys are amazing with nothing more than a guitar a tambourine, voice and the percussionists boots!
B00005N6KG|4.0|The sound quality is nice - loud, good bass. The headphones fit slightly awkwardly in my ear & there is a gap between my head and the top of the headphones. Not ideal for the gym.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was so intence on so many levels and I loved every minute of it. Travis can be a bit much but you know what who cares as long as he doesnt hurt anyone that doesnt deserve let him be. Hes only that way because hes never loved anyone before and he fell hard. I loved it and can wait to read his side of the story in walking disaster. Loved this book.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|The Wrestler put a choke hold on me from the beginning and never let up.<br />Mickey Rourke's performance is so honest and moving that you almost forget to judge his acting because you forget he is in fact, acting.<br />As over the hill wrestler Randy the Ram he shows so much vulnerability and range it's mesmerizing.<br />The film itself is very moving and endears you to his character,anyone who has ever felt alone or at the end of an era in their life can relate to this character and even if you cant relate you will empathize with him.<br />Marisa Tomei is great as an aging exotic dancer with fading dreams of her own and Evan Rachael Wood is, as always, fantastic as Randy's estranged daughter who finds little sympathy for his past misgivings .<br />Rourke deserves any and every award he has and may take for this role. It's a role of a lifetime.<br />The film itself is Oscar worthy as are the Actors and it's the stuff people who love independent film is made of.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bought this for my son.  He saw the movie and wanted to read the book for a school book report.  He couldn't put it down.  He has read the others in the series and they are equally as good according to him.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Maiden England is about as classic as you can get and a great time piece of when the band had the world at large. Recorded over two nights at the Birmingham NEC, the band played an incredible show for their home crowd. The setlist features the then new songs from the Seventh Son album, along with some deeper cuts and fan favorites. The band sounds fantastic, though the years constant of touring up to then began to take toll on Bruce's voice, but he still delivers a great performance. This would prove to be the last of what many consider the 'golden' lineup of the band, as Adrian Smith would soon depart over creative differences and to persue a solo career in A.S.A.P. This concert was a great bookend to Maiden's dominance in the 80's and why they earned their spot in history.<br /><br />The 2013 version of this show offers many new things to those still holding on to their original copy or those who may have missed the boat the first go around. First, it's now entitled 'Maiden England '88', my guess because their current tour is entitled Maiden England but who knows. Next, the artwork. Now, I like the artwork, but for such a classic and iconic show, they should've stuck with Derek's original cover, though it is featured on Disc 2's art so they didn't totally forget. The sound on this set is fantastic compared to the original, bringing out every instrument in a clear mix. Now for the closing 3 tracks, they have never been issued before, as the original Maiden England was only issued as a edited single-disc. Reading the liner notes reveals they were specially mixed by Kevin Shirley, and they sound great and keep the flow best as possible with the original release. Overall, if you're a Maiden fan and don't own this at all or lost your old copy, now's the perfect time to get this historic show in it's entirety and sounding better than ever. Up the Irons!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game has an old school feel to it. Controls are simple and easy. Great look for us that remember out Atari days. Good job guys.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A great book, easy to read and one that was hard to put down once you started.  Looking forward to reading the next one.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|What a shame that this series is not in production. Filled with warmth and humor and plenty of action that viewing it only left me wanting more!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I needed a car charger for my iPhone 5 and iPad 3.  After reading a few reviews on this one I decided to give it a try.  So far it has not disappointed me.  It feels sturdy and well made.  I like the compact size which fits in my purse no problem.  I plugged the iPhone and iPad in  the same time and it charges both the same time.  It's a good charger to take on trips, when you are out all day and without a car.  (The iPhone 5 seems to drain the battery a lot faster than the iPhone 4) I'm thinking about getting one for my sister as her iPhone's battery goes dead all the time.
B001EN71CW|5.0|What a shame that this series is not in production. Filled with warmth and humor and plenty of action that viewing it only left me wanting more!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is awesome!  My son loves SW and Angry Birds so this was a winning combination for sure.  He loves this game and I've even caught myself borrowing his kindle to &#34;see how the game works&#34;.  Couldn't be happier!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a five star game because IT IS FLIPPIN AWSOME!<br />It is better than the first temple run.
B0094K21QI|5.0|The Movie was great. The Amazon streaming was glitching and stop and go. Frustrated. Definitely not hd was low quality.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Another great read from James Rollins.  Loved the blending of Native Americans, Early American history, and science.  Thanks so much!
B006TF6WAM|3.0|A whimsical little tale of human courage.  Charming and well written.  With a happy ending in spite of what could have gone wrong.
0307476073|3.0|I respect and admire the author for her courage and her ability to choose the road less traveled.  This, plus her amazing ability to tell a story and her willingness to bare her soul.  However this is more a book about grief recovery.  She walks you through the details of her mother's agonizing death, her feelings of loss and sadness.  She uses her walk on the PCT as a catharsis and a healing process.  Though I can empathize with Cheryl over her loss, it is sadness for her mother that I feel.  Cheryl lived to hike the trail and fulfill her dreams, her mother did not.  Her mother did not get to see the dawning of her own fiftieth birthday.  If you have been through a period of bereavement recently, this will break your heart.<br /><br />From my own perspective, I could have done with a thumbnail sketch of her mother's death and more adventure on the trail.  And again, just from my own point of view, I look for a trail book to be fun and exciting, uplifting.....but not sad, even heartbreaking, as some portions of this book are.<br /><br />On the positive side of the hike, Cheryl is fearless with a great ability to improvise and is steadfast in her beliefs.  She meets each new day with an appreciation and takes time to savor the beauty of the PCT.  If you are looking for a fun book, try Keith Foskett, for healing and recovery.... this is just the ticket.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I loved this app before the update, when it was simple and easy to use. Now it is clunky and has very poor flow. Additionally, before the update, I never had issues with the app being such a drain on my battery, now however, it's just awful. I would love to see this go back to the way it was and am SO glad I did not buy the paid version of the app.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Gave a great look at the war with Iraq only read it because Kyle was killed last month in texas
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So glad to find season 3.  Now I am all caught up and waiting for season 4.  I just found out about this great series.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I recommend it, my girls loved it, and finally we got to watch without purchasing DVD. Even if you dont have kindle or whatever, it is good to watch in your laptop.
0007208316|5.0|I love shakespeare and could not find his books around where I live and this book in particular is great because it has all his plays that I wanted in it so all you shakespeare fans I highly recommend this book..
0689835604|5.0|I had the opportunity at my grandchild's house to read this book and couldn't wait to order it for another family . She is a one year old and enjoyed the flaps but I mostly enjoyed 'learning' the body parts .  I'm a former first grade teacher.
B0051GOB26|5.0|Awesome, Came promptly and arrived in brand new quality. This is easily my favorite movie so the limited edition 28 page book built in is awesome. I love this movie!

0439023521|5.0|Of all the books Suzanne Collins has written, Hunger Games is by far the best and certainly the most popular. This book is heart stopping and you will not want to stop reading. The protagonist, 16 year old Katniss Everdeen, is faced with the hardest decision in her life. After her father passed away in a mining accident Katniss had to take over as head of the house and care for her little sister, Prim. Being very poor she had to learn early how to hunt for food. This meant facing the wilderness and learning the ways of the woods. But at the reaping, her world suddenly turns upside down. The reaping is where two children from each district, one boy and one girl in-between the ages of 11 and 18, are chosen to fight to the death in an arena for the entertainment of the citizens of the Capitol. There are a total of twelve districts, Katniss being in the 12th. These Games were created by the President of Panem because of an uprising of the districts against the Capitol. The Hunger Games occurs every year to suppress the districts. All of the kids in the arena have one objective, to win. By the end, there is only one lone victor, everyone else dies. These people are forced to kill before they get killed.  In this thrilling book Katniss takes the biggest risk of her life, to volunteer to go into the Games. Throughout the Games Katniss must remember everything that she has learned back home, and put it into good use. On her journey she makes, and loses, friends.  Escaping death isn't easy. Katniss only has one objective on her mid, to win for her sister Prim. I highly recommend this book and you should definitely read the books that fallow to see what happens to Katniss after the Hunger Games are over. This is such a great, heart-pounding book that is necessary to read!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was awesome! I can't wait for the next book to come out! My favorite characters were Piper and Annabeth.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's A great game to play at home and on the road<br />If you don't have it try it out
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A true Nicholas Sparks book. I couldn't put it down.  The twist at the end was brilliant and makes you think of what you have and who you've lost.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This app is okay, but is a little hard to navigate. The index (once you find it) is not intuitive, but with trial and error, is quickly learned. Had to go to help pages frequently at first. The content is great and the audio playback is wonderful.<br />Good app, I just wish it had a better interface.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I really like Flipboard,  It is easy to use and allows me to have all the sites that interest me and magazines and blogs that interest me in one place.  It is well designed and works really well on my tablet.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|This is a an interesting film and very thought-provoking.  Some people might find the subject matter rather confronting but it is a subject that needs to be discussed more openly and this was well done, especially as it was based on a true story.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|Great performance from the Duane Allman era....love it.  Every time I hear Skydog play, I remember just how much the music world lost with his passing.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|I have always liked Patrick Swayze, and enjoy all movies with him playing in them. He is a great performer.
B0006B2A42|5.0|Hudson and McGoohan are excellent actors and made this film come alive. I'm glad that I don't have to endure what some of our military men have to endure.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I am a huge Stephen king fan. This book is an all time classic of his and should be treasured forever.
B0094K1K42|4.0|Charlize Theron pulls no punches in making her character both hateable and pitiable. if you're looking for action, this is going to dissappoint you - it's very much a character study of a human stopped clock.
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|The cave scenes were fake looking and it ended in the middle of the movie. If it's part one of.... it should say that
B0011ZVOBC|3.0|Okay, I imagine some folks are saying, \\"What the hell?  This is a great album!\\"  And, had this been the first Fear Factory album, I would have given it 4 stars.  However, by the time of this album, Fear Factory is still writing good songs, but they just aren't standing out against the rest of Fear Factory's catalog.  For all the ingenuity this band showed early in their career, this album doesn't add anything stylistically.  However, Obsolete contains my favorite Fear Factory song to date, and that is the song Resurrection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|... I really dig this game because you can play it right out of the box for Free!  :-)<br /><br />Rich

B007MNV5WU|5.0|there. are so many levels. There are even planets with ice and candy. At the end of planet's you face etheir the king pig or the papa pig.  At the end of the candy planet you face this HUGE pig. This game is AWSOME!
B001NEYO8Q|5.0|Hard to fine movie and this one I found from my bed without leaving it that's cool to me thank you
B00005A46T|5.0|I'm not sure why this even requires a review as everyone should already know it's awesome and that they need to buy it right now.
B007A6XLDU|1.0|It looks very pretty but that's all. Editing is really slow and with consistent crashes. So frustrating! SAVE YOUR MONEY. I've purchased another app called OLIVEOFFICE that is much easier to use.
B00969GFFU|5.0|Well, it took me two months to get through the 600 pages of Freedom, but it was worth every minute. Franzen is a darn good writer with a keen understanding of the human condition and society's flaws. Freedom is a slice of life and a slap at our way of life. Kudos to the writer.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I knew I would have to buy it for my collection.  It is so wonderful; the two little girls in this movie are so sweet - my favorite part of the movie.  I always feel happy after watching it.  I would recommend this movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables 2012 was a very ambitious production. The first half of the movie I would give four stars because there were a few scenes that I didn't completely like the way they were done, a few camera angles seem too close up, and a few other parts seemed rushed through, and maybe it's just me but I couldn't understand every word that was sung, and with 99 percent of it being sung when the 1 percent that's not sung it seems odd in hoping they would finally do some talking but they didn't. Although, it's understandable they wanted to pick up the pace to get to the rest of the story. There could have been a few more scenes to show the relationship between Valjean and Cosette. Isabelle Allen was very good as the young Cosette and she could have had a few more scenes as well. Samantha Barks as Eponine was amazing. Aaron Tveit as Enjolras was perfect in bringing the strong desire of the revolution to fight for freedom. Because Les Miserables 2012 was a musical it was phenomenal in expressing the strength of emotions of the revolution. This was similar to the Les Miserables Tenth Anniversary Concert dvd (with Ruthie Henshall, Lea Salonga, and others) that I give 10 Stars because the finale is epic. In Les Miserables 1998 Geoffrey Rush was excellent with ruthlessness, and Liam Neeson was great in showing mercy and being humble, but the 1998 version was not a musical. Les Miserables 2012 is a musical and the second half of the movie I give five stars and the ending scene is SPECTACULAR.
B009LRJ9EQ|4.0|The playing here has a rhapsodic, improvisatory quality which is utterly beguiling; the interpolated trills and flourishes, beginning immediately even in the opening aria, seem to derive from the sheer joy and exuberance Sokilov experiences in playing this timeless music. His mechanical prestidigitation is a thing of wonder yet its percussive regularity is tempered and balanced by the whimsy of the pianist's phrasing in the lyrical sections. There is enormous variety of mood and approach within this concert; the fifth variation is the epitome of insouciant Romaticism, like a rippling brook, whereas in No.8 Sokolov out-Goulds Gould for manic attack. The \\"Black Pearl\\" is by contrast almost too restrained and hesitant, courting stasis. One accusation you certainly cannot level at Sokolov is that his interpretation lacks personality<br /><br />Unfortunately, the boxy, aggressive recording by Melodiya acoustic harkens back to another Russian (Soviet) style of recording, and the famed knowledgeable attentiveness of Russian audiences is belied by the inconsiderate hacks and sneezes which punctuate the playing. Such a pity that this most characterful, idiosyncratic and indeed fascinating account is marred by clangourous sound and Yahoos in the front seats.<br /><br />The Partita and English Suite which complete CD2 are from other live concerts. Brilliantly executed, they are also in better sound before more appreciative and better disciplined listeners.
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is for adults only. I really enjoy this type of crude humor, so I thought it was very funny. I had already watched a few video clips of the funny scenes in Ted and I wish I had not seen them before watching the dvd because then it would have been even funnier while watching the dvd Ted. I almost put four stars because I totally did not like the serious ending, and while I knew what they were getting at that changed the tone from funny to sad plus serious with some sentimental, and it would have been so much better if the ending of Ted continued being funny. There were some funny parts before the aweful ending and that's what I'm giving five stars saying was funny. I'm looking forward to Ted 2 and hope they keep the entire movie a comedy like Ted was up until the last part.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it's a wonderful game for young and old!  I have it on my kindle fire,with no issues at all!<br />if you like classic games GET THIS ONE!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I'm a tern mom and my kids Courtney and Shianne love this game and so do I.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild is one of the best books I have ever read.!  I really felt like I was hiking alongside the author!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Very enthralling and painfully accurate detail of struggles in Cold War Soviet Russia. Great character development and plot twists to keep you captivated.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Iv always been a fan of the fighting robot concept and iv never thought of watching the movie but now i want to own it
0061353248|5.0|This book is full of surprises about how human beings (JUST LIKE ME) think and act and why they make the weirdo choices that they make.  Amazing and fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game the only thing I hats is I think you should be able to collect the gems also when you have the magnet power up. that would be a whole lot better!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book grabs your interest from the first sentence and never lets go. There is a surprise around every corner - it is not predictable. It's one of those rare books where you are sad to reach the end.<br /><br />The moving back and forth between the 1940s, the 1960 and present day can be a little confusing. It is important to pay close attention to indicators of the decade as you read.
B00AXOPOD6|4.0|The book is great... so far, but the translations from hard copy to the Kindle copy is a bit messy. There are a few letter, punctuation, and spacing mistakes on each page. Those problems aren't too hard to get passed and ignore. :)
B0086449YA|3.0|I've really enjoyed Mark Knopfler's guitar work and song writing starting way back when he fronted Dire Straits. However,  about the time when Sailing to Philadelphia came out I began to notice a change.  His songs on balance seemed to me to begin to loose some of the lustre (inspiration?) of his earlier work.  I began to hear repetitions of the same guitar tones and riffs, the songs seemed more melancholy, and more and more songs lacked &#34;hooks&#34;.  HIs skills as a storyteller/songwriter are still strong as ever.  However, for me its the musical and arranging side that is faltering.  To me, this entire CD has a somewhat Celtic or Northern England feel to it.  I don't mind a few songs in this vein, but almost every song has this feeling.  Some of the songs totally lack any musical hooks at all.  Matter-of-fact, I can't at the moment recall the melody/sound of a single tune.  I listened to the whole CD, but nothing stuck with me.  I do remember liking the tune &#34;Red Bud Tree&#34; though.  A very classic Knopfler piece of work.  So, I bought the CD on the strength of my enjoyment of his past work and hoping for something interesting.  However, if I did not know Mark and someone handed me the CD to listen to, then after listening to it had asked me if I wanted to buy it.  Sorry to say, I would have said, &#34;No&#34;.  So, bottom line: the lyrics are well done, the recording quality is top notch, musicianship is superb, the musical creativity or production/arrangement is not up to par.  With a few exceptions, the songs seemed very subdued perhaps almost lackluster.  Very little grabbed my ear and made me say &#34;That was cool what he did there&#34;.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|will not let me unlock the game. I feel like it may have taken my money and its needs to be fixed asap or the game is a dead end game. fix the glitches please
B00004Y6NT|5.0|One of the early CD's released by Dire Straits.  Mark Knopfler's songwriting skills were really strong back then.  Beautiful electric guitar work, haunting melodies, superb musical arrangements.  One of the best from the Dire Straits era.  A must have if you like Dire Straits.
B003K15INU|1.0|I chose one because there were a few good moments in the book. I totally suffered through most of it. I found it quite boring and frustrating. There were pages of pages of obsessive rambling. I am sorry I read it,  it was a waste of precious time were I could have read something more profound and memorable.<br />H
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The book scratches the itch the movie never could. Mitchell tells you three (four?) different stories, all excellent shorts in their own right, with a decent attempt at bringing them all together. But for me, their truths are held independent, and the unifying narrative is existential, the things people go through to be alive. Great voices, vocabularies, and even futurology. Recommended public transport reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really am enjoying this game,  if you love all the characters from the Ice Age movies this is definitely the game for you.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of side puzzles not to easy but not very hard either. Just right. Liked story line. Worth the money.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Fun but glitches and pauses too much. I dont like how if i press down it goes side ways. Its just messed up
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is great!!!!<br />I love the game I play it all the time.<br />I am sooooo. good and the game is great for any tablet!!!
B00127RAJY|3.0|Its an exercise video, like many others.  Wife used it for about 3 days and it now sits.. . .
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The morning after I watched this film I emailed my best friend: &#34;Run, don't walk, to see Intouchables&#34;.  It's an extraordinary story of the search for authenticity and human connection in two lives that seem to be falling apart.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Well designed and easy to use for calculations on the go and you can't beat the price. Well done calculator application
B00005ATZT|5.0|best movie i've seen for a long time. it gets slightly boring but just a few minutes otherwise the entire movie is very very intelligent well acted great story you name it. Congrats to the producers & actors.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|This is the first CD I've listened to by the apparently popular singer David Bowtie. It seems pretty stupid. He seems to be ripping off Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. He's pretty old too, maybe he should give up, I don't think he'll be remembered unlike guys like Justin Timberlake.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I borrowed it from Lendle.me and read it in one day, now I'm suffering an after shock of it. I loved both Sky and Holder, and Karen, too, for her selflessness. I nearly cried at the scene where Sky was talking to little Hope. After reading such a mind-blowing book, I'll not be able to read another one for a long while.
B0091REZMW|5.0|a great game. tutorial was helpful but definately a bit wordy. but overall a really great game to spend my time playing.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It is an exciting ghost story and it has great graphics. I cannot wait for the sequel. wow, wow, wow!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|A very nice collection of Fleetwood Mac songs. It really is The very best of Fleetwood Mac. We received the CD promptly and it was in excellent condition. We are currently on an extended road trip & this is one of the CDs that seems to get a lot of play.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|this movie is the best movie ever thanks for making a movie that i really do like i hope you keep it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0012HF5NC|2.0|I have seen the movie several years ago and I do like the movie,  Amazon did not download the movie to my TIVO.  I do not know what happened and I may attempt to contact them when I have very much time to go through the process.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Supposedly this is to work offline, but I can't get it to. I really like the ease of use, but the church we are attending doesn't have wireless internet available.  So, it doesn't work there for me :(
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is perfect for passing the time. It is so fun and easy to use! In my opinion the vast solitar app yet
B004YOEFG8|5.0|I felt like I was there.  I even called my Dad to come over and watch this in 3D it was so amazing.  My sister was stunned.  We didn't know what to do with ourselves.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|May be the best thing Hofffman ever did. The direction is flawless. The story glows. A rare comic delight. Buy it!
B007REV4T8|5.0|What was expected, and arrived on schedule. I would recommend the picture and the company that sent me the video. Top honors
B009L6UDUG|5.0|One of the best Bond's. Good timely service. Complete satisfaction. Will do more deals like this (hopefully). Yes, yes, yes.
B009C5Z112|4.0|I've listened to this album about 10 times thus far, maybe more. This is necessary because there is A LOT to soak in on this album.<br /><br />I can say after my listens that this album is good, really good. The compositions are well done and I like the orchestration, but it just doesn't live up to the hype it's been getting. &#34;Sons of the Winter and Stars&#34; is one track that starts strong, but I find myself getting lost during the middle parts of this song. It doesn't hold me. Then towards the end it picks up again and it sounds fantastic especially with the clean vocals starting to take the center stage. I feel this song could have been a lot more concise in its approach.<br /><br />The next song &#34;Land of Snow and Sorrow&#34; is the best track on the album. It does what the second track could have done. It boasts great composition, orchestration, a great chorus and it's done in a much more concise manner.<br /><br />&#34;Darkness and Frost&#34; is nothing more than an interlude into the final track and a pretty average interlude at that. It's kind of cool, but it's borderline filler.<br /><br />The closing track &#34;Time&#34; is also a fantastic number. I find this track not holding me in a few parts, but not as bad as the second track. That said, it's a great closing track to the album and leaves you wanting to hear Time II.<br /><br />So, am I glad I bought this album? Yes, and I'd recommend it to anyone, I would just warn that it doesn't quite live up to the hype it's been getting, and there were plenty of albums released in 2012 that are more worth your time.
B009NUV0E8|5.0|You can keep all the rest of the Bonds (including the latest!). Pierce Brosnan was and is the best of the group.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I loved the app because of all the variety of noises it gives you. I got it for free on app of the day, but if i would have know it was this great, i would have paid for it
B006MW3UZW|3.0|I've been watching this over time, it is slow much of the time though I do find it very interesting that the staff work all day long to put out three meals a day for the wealthy family of Downton.  It's as if they are on a 'mission' everyday, and that is to feed the boss and his people.
B0026REBG4|5.0|If you're a Tolkien fan, you should buy and read this. Be prepared for lots of stuff that are in the movie(s) that isn't in this book.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This movie brings forth insight and honesty into what should be important in life.  Most importantly, this movie shared the amazing journey this young man took to find the answer(s) he needed to find life's meaning.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|So far I've really enjoyed this game, I haven't gotten too far in it, but its certainly fun. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a bit of fun!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Love it and it's very new sealed as will recommend anyone to order movie through Michael and thank you too!
B00457X8BC|4.0|I liked this book . I want to read more from this author.I will order more. Heard about him from the tv series. Both the Englis and the Swedish versions. High recommendation
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|We love the stories of Peter Pan. It was new sealed and no damage. I appreciated the honest price. Thank you.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but I absolutely loved this movie. Not what I expected it to be, even better!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best series I've ever watched, can't wait to see the finale next week!!! I am addicted and so are my friends, we love it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny, entertaining book, would recommend it for a quick, fun read. First book I've read from Mira Lynn Kelly, really enjoyed it, would definitely read another.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|Excellent music, great memories. They totally should have a channel on Sirius XM where this music is played and enjoyed!
B007REV4YI|5.0|In his interview, Roger Moore went on to say \\" I thought his action was quite extraordinary --he did more action in the first 30 seconds of the film than I did in 14 years of playing Bond. To me, he looks like a killer. He looks as though he knows what he's doing. I look as though I might cheat at backgammon.\\"<br /><br />And that is it, really. No disrespect to my father's James Bond played by Sean Connery - who WAS my favorite Bond before _Skyfall_ - but Craig just FEELS like the killer that one needs to be in the role of 00 agent on Her Majesty's Secret Service. Craig is just incredibly believable in this role.<br /><br />I'm not going to describe a plot you can devour in ten thousand other places. The wonder of this movie is that it is a transitional film bringing in new players for old roles and modernizing Bond for today's world. Despite that, it has action sequences that stand shoulder to shoulder with the best the fifty year old franchise has to offer.<br /><br />The strength of this movie is Dame Judith Dench in the role of 'M'. There has never been a M/007 relationship in the history of the BOND franchise even close to being as intriguing as this one and Craig and Dench drain that relationship for every last drop of charisma in this film. There are a lot of good Bond movies out there. I consider this a great Bond _FILM_.
B000001F45|5.0|Excellent music, great memories. They totally should have a channel on Sirius XM where this music is played and enjoyed!
B006K1C0MO|4.0|These guys have a cool sound, they don't stray far from it, but it is different than most. Part tool, part morbid angel, and very groovy and dig-able. I recommend it for any fan of &#34;groove&#34; metal.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|It was so boring for so long at first it ruined any chance of a good rating. Plus no Jason... Well, a picture. A 2 is generous.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Not album of the year, but as solid as any other of their releases.  It's not chocked full of radio hits but that may be why I like it.  It's not an obvious money grab with radio friendly pop oriented rock, its more like badmotorfinger in that respect.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Wow. Well I guess you know this is a Harry Bosch novel and that's about all I can tell you as anyone who's read Connelly before can tell you the trip always takes different turns. In that respect this is a typical Bosch story. It was a fun read. If you haven't read Bosch stories before, may I suggest to start with The Poet or some other earlier ones as there is a progression in his life in the stories. A good read to all though.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|This was one of my first Blu-Ray purchases, and I couldn't be happier with the quality of the picture and sound... the movie wasn't bad, either.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I started to play the game and couldn't stop it is so addicting but very fun :) It is now my favorite came of all time I recommend it 100%
0307743659|5.0|Its Just Awesome! It takes you on a ride and makes you ask questions about your own sanity. Its a must read.
B0060MYM7O|2.0|I received on time but the Digital copy cant download. Once in the website of redeeming immediate a message states &#34; service not available&#34;. Also the DVD copy is scratched and stained badly. causing my comp to hanged. Also DVD cant be played!!!!!!!! Ther blu ray luckily is fine if not I will create A TREMENDOUS OUTROAR. Also the packaging cover not done properly. Can see the edge of paper cover cut badly and stick badly as well. PPL online keep saying Dont support piracy nut this original is so bad in overall. Spending that MONEY and time for it to shipped to other continents.......OMG. Amazon UK did a fine job then Anmazon US. I ordered 1st season with Amazon UK, its fantastic in everything. I am sorry to say and compared using such remarks but as a consumer, thought you should know. Anything can be done for my case since you guys wants feedback?????
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put this book down . Wow... can not wait to read the southern to and see the movie.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I'm loving the music contained in this magnificent set.<br /> However a minor quibble with the liner notes in the booklet. Michael O'Hara Garcia makes mention of \\"Go And Say Goodbye\\" as being a bit of Buck Owens in influence. More to the point he might have added that the guitar riff is based off of an old bluegrass lick Chris Hillman of the Byrds taught Stephen. That was my understanding anyway. Nice set.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These three books are the BEST books I've ever read<br />If you haven't read them yet I highly recommend up do
B00000JTB2|5.0|After all reviews I just find I buy what I love. How can you beat these two if the master mixing is done halfway decent. The only 2 things missing are Robert Johnson in today's era and Eric Clapton. I just buy right.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat , I could not stop reading it. I'm going to read it again
0307592731|1.0|Another book I would not have read had it not been a book club choice.  The decisions made by Cheryl seemed so inane at times that it is hard to truly believe that it's a memoir!  She lost me when she went off the tracks when her mother died (after complaining about her her entire life), binge drinking, addicting herself to drugs (temporarily), sleeping with any man available at the time, giving up a stable, supportive husband--too much!!  Not enough self-discovery revealed in her lonely journey, or at least it was lonely most of the time, which is what I was expecting to find.  Very disappointed.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|it's one of my favorite seasons of the series, and the fact that it was Priced so low was awesome!!
B000YDCFUQ|3.0|I've wanted these for about 4 years, and saw them on sale here.  They fit a little bigger, so I sized comfortably down to a 12D when I wear a 13 in running shoes.<br /><br />Great casual looking \\"work\\" boot.<br /><br />EDIT:  11/13/13<br /><br />Very deceptively, these boots are clearly stated to be \\"Full Grain\\" leather in the description, however mine say \\"Genuine Leather\\" inside them.  I'm writing to Timberland to get the real story on the construction of these.  What wonder some people have quality concerns...<br /><br />Minus 2 stars!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is well written. Very easy to read. Once you start reading it you won't wanna put it down.
B00C1C0GEK|3.0|This show could be amazing, we love the basic plot.  To the people who think there are no serial killers with followers - please google The Manson Family.  For those who think that there are no highly intelligent psychos, Ted Bundy was a very intelligent man, and he like most male serial killers had a bunch of women who were obsessed with him after his final capture.  The psycho in this case has a relatively small group of followers and the point of the show is it is a cult - not a superstar serial killer.  I truly wish that these things were true in real life that there were not any super sharp psychos and that serial killers didn't have followers...it sickens me to know how many women spend time communicating their \\"love\\" to convicted killers they have never met and wouldn't know exist had they never killed.<br /><br />The FBI being so idiotic and behind the ball is what makes this show so hard to watch.  As we watched the first couple of episodes both my husband and I said we loved the idea behind it but we felt they were going to continue to make the FBI look so dumb that it was going to be hard to watch in the future...if something doesn't change with this show we will stop watching.<br /><br />It gets even more unbelievable when they have this group of supposedly \\"sophisticated\\" individuals up against the FBI, but their \\"ops\\" are sloppy at best yet they always easily defeat the FBI no matter how big their force is.  HIGHLY UNBELIEVABLE! Come on, an FBI agent that watches his 2 partners get gunned down in a hallway blocks off a door so you can't open it then stands in front of it!!?  What for, was he waiting to get shot, because other than that I suppose the bad guys could have taken the door off the hinges and come in that way without shooting through the door.  When Ryan and Claire left into that courtyard in the back of the hotel any \\"sophisticated\\" organization running that type of operation would have had some bad guys waiting outside in case anyone came out the back door of a hotel room.<br /><br />Bottom line the show could be amazing but lacks any realistic action.  PLEASE hire someone to write your scenes that find the FBI and the cult going up against each other in a physically combative situation.  Get a writer that understands how the FBI actually works and make this show more feasible or you will lose out on viewers, people will put up with a certain amount of stupidity on tv but this is becoming one of those shows where the characters make so many bad decisions it is hard to watch.
B004OR199G|5.0|I read the Beauty Detox Solution about a year ago and it completely transformed the way I saw food. This one is very similar, including the green smoothies, juices, raw foods, and cutting out dairy and animal foods. I really enjoyed it, and I even highlighted a few things I had not learned elsewhere. I think this book is great for cancer patients because the author has been there. She has done all the digging and experimenting with what works and doesn't work.
1400049628|5.0|This one was a hit at the firehouse and by my 11 yr. old son (might indicate the maturity level of the firehouse, but oh well).  This book is fun and very easy to read.  Almost the perfect bathroom reader.  Worth the money and the concepts in it have a lot of logic (and I'm a prepper.)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A truly fantastic book! Very imaginative. Loved every word. Definitely a must read. Much better than the movie and that was terrific.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A great story well told - with more than enough real science for real Science Fiction fans. This author goes on my get-it-all list.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I recommend it to anyone who is on the go. and likes games. or heck even if they just want to get ride of space in there mobile divice
0374533571|5.0|You probably have seen the movie which was great, but the book gives you so much more.  The two together make a great combination.  You learn so much more about the pain of mental illness while enjoying a great love story.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I'm still in shock over the ending or lack there of. Nothing was tied up.... I hope she plans on writing a surprise fourth book.....
B000YADE04|5.0|I love this movie!!  Brendan Fraser plays naive and goofy really well.  Alicia Silverstone plays bitchy really well and is only super annoying once in this movie (the way she says hospitably-argggg.)  Christopher Walken is nuts as always but brilliantly nuts and he and Sissy Spacek are good together in these roles.  The concept is original and fun.  I highly recommend you check this one out.
B005TZFYNE|3.0|I don't really love it. Not her best work but not her worst either. I say save your money and just buy the songs you like instead of the whole album.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This movie was really good, appropriate for the whole family. The graphics were amazing especially on something as small as a kindle.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|IT IS A FABULOUS CD.  LOVE THE OLD SCHOOL KINDA TWIST ON IT.  GREAT CD AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS AWESOME
B007BRJYF2|4.0|This is a good game but more for a kid then an adult. There is not much challenge other than looking for a certain # of objects. Nothing to figure out.
B009AOFNU4|2.0|Nice small gamepad. Feels nice and well constructed. Is Not completely compatible with all the games it claims to be. Just for example, in GTA III, there is no way to start automobile missions, nor cycle weapons. With SteelEngine App for Android, you can Not \\"Remap all 12 buttons via Steel Series Engine\\" as the product description claims. You can not remap any of the buttons At All. The ONLY thing the SteelEngine app does is show you an image of the gamepad, and highlight the buttons as you press them, and allow you to log/send an email to their alleged support, that's it. I connected this to my Nexus 10 in about 15 seconds, with no bluetooth issues before downloading and installing the steel engine app. It kinda works with all games, just not all on screen functions are acceptable on gamepad while using it. With the gamepad synced, the onscreen functions are not accessible. No customer support whatsoever, or at least no response to the email I sent them over a week, still waiting.<br /><br /> Purchase at your own risk. This controller is way over priced. It may be worth 79.99 if you could do all that the manufacturer claimed you could, but you can not. The functions on this device that do work work well.<br />I've synced this device to my wife's galaxy tab 2, same results.<br /><br />After realizing this gamepad was not intended for an android, I connected it via Buletooth, to my pc, no problem. (Just a side note for others, you'll need to unpair or turn off your tablet first). I installed the windows version of SteelEngine and was able to remap any button I chose. And this works, for the PC, but when I reconnect it to my tablet all buttons are back to the manufacturer's default. Reconnected to my PC and buttons are automatically remapped to my configuration.<br /><br />If the SteelEngine app is ever updated/fixed for the Android, this gamepad will be a must for gamers.
1616550414|5.0|Excelente, livro de muito boa qualidade, item de colecionador e por um preço muito atrativo.<br />O prazo de entrega levou mais ou menos um mês, oque achei até rápido para uma importação.
B007AFB868|5.0|Taymor does an amazing job portraying both the essentric woman who was Frida Kahlo and the time frame in which she lived. She achieved making both a artistic and historically true film which is very enjoyable to watch. The film is literally jam packed with events from Frida's life. While I watched the film with back ground information and enjoyed it very much I think that with out back ground knowledge the film would be hard to understand and the watcher may be unable to fully appreciate it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The graphics are realistic and neat.....easy to level up and a all around great game!!!  Btw I am 42yrs old and love all the Ice Age movies !!!! and it isn't because I am the mother of 10 yr old twin girls either.....lol
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Even though its not the best singing ever I really feel the intimacy of the film every time in watch it. Some of the scenes are so intense I find myself getting lost in the world of Les Mis.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Read the more in depth reviews about the mouse if you want specific, detailed qualities. I think Anker did a great job with this, and it does everything as advertised.<br /><br />With so many obvious pros seeing as how everything else works, my only complaint is that if you close the program for mapping mouse buttons and then open it back up, all of the mapped buttons have reset. This is not true of the mouse, but if you need to adjust one button and apply it, then you'll have to adjust them all again.<br /><br />Seriously though, aside from that one little quirk this mouse is awesome for gaming.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It was great to watch again. Everyone I know who has watch this has loved it. I hope they continue for many seasons.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|We really enjoyed this film as a family. Our 4 year old just started having nightmares (getting that vivid imagination). This helped us explain that she can choose to be fearful or choose to be brave. Nothing is too scary even the boogie man.<br />She also loves superhero movies so this played into that too for her.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|this app is utter bull.I tryed it 3 times.the first it froze while loading the mb.so I had to quit.the second time on the menu. it hes a fb login,I do t have fb and there's a guest login so I hit that and typed my name then the app shut down the second time the same thing happened.so then I deleted it and reinstalled it.then it did the same thing 2 more times.do not get you will regret it
B004QYTRRS|3.0|The thing that ruined this movie for me was, of all things, the music.  It was scored like a romance, paced like a thriller.  But was rarely thrilling. They tried a cross-genre mix that didn't work. But the music killed it - it was so badly scored that it pulled me out of the movie every time a \\"soaring\\" theme played.<br /><br />I thought Johnny Depp was wooden, and he kept speaking throughout the movie with an odd American/British accent - I was confused, but in the end it seems like it may have been intentional.  He's such a good actor that I gave him the benefit of the doubt throughout the movie - but again, this pulled me out of the moment.<br /><br />There's very little chemistry between Jolie and Depp - at one point she shifts from 'playing him' to being in love with him, but as a viewer you miss the transition and go, \\"wait - now she's in love with him?  When did that happen?\\"  And even that he is in love with her feels odd and wooden.  The movie might have worked if it were an hour longer, re-edited, and definitely re-scored.  But as it stands, it's not great.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Sofia is the first princess show on Disney Jr.  My preschooler loves it.  I even like it.  Recommend it.  It is, as with all Disney products, excellent.
B008VBYN80|2.0|Cannot connect to Facebook or Gameloft for social aspects. Very annoying. Cannot do any PvP. Worked for a few days then times out every time.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This classic game is rendered in beautiful detail on the Kindle Fire HD. I really like the ability to insert one of my own photot as the background behind the cards.  If you like Freecell, this is the version to get!
B00BSBVLF8|2.0|Children found it disturbing and we had to turn it off. Music and imagery was very dark - as a circus you would assume it would appeal to children but it is not for this audience
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I wanted to love this seemingly innovative product,as I've loved Skip Hop products before, but within a few weeks of use, it was useless!<br /><br />1. The strap broke at the point that attached to the wipes container.<br />2. The red, sliding access point had popped off so many times that it no longer slid along the track well.<br />3. Bad Construction: The actual process of opening the container requires 2 strong hands and thumbs (not ideal when you're wrestling a child with a dirty diaper on a dirty bathroom diaper changing station).<br />4. Bad Construction: Pulling the wipes out causes either shredding or a whole handful of them coming out.<br /><br />Save your money, don't buy this product!
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Nice, fun, cute movie good for all ages. Clean, no overt or covert social messages. Just a have fun popcorn movie. Even Minnesotans like us think it's good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Love to read but I need to have a writer that can put me in<br />the story, Suzanne Collins does this. You are afraid, sad, happy,<br />you can smell the woods, and  hear the sounds of the strange birds.  Reading ,BOOK TWO!!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Awesome to have the whole series in one complete set. Packaging was great and was a wonderful gift idea; excellent series.
B000I3PERS|5.0|It is a classical movie and the price was right and Mel Gibson is great in this movie not like is like now
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I usually like &#34;dumb fun&#34; movies but this was just painful.  I watched for a half hour and had to stop.  Such a waste of time and $3.99!!  The premise was great and could have been so funny but it just wasn't.  The acting was horrible, the jokes were stupid (not stupid funny, just stupid).  Don't waste your time.
B009AMANH4|1.0|To the uninformed, the politics of this movie may seem to make sense. However, to anyone that knows better, it is socialist propaganda, through and through. How many times does one have to hear \\"EQUALITY\\" over and over again before they understand what the people behind this movie are trying to promote. Let's be realistic, there was more to the Civil War than this nonsense. From what I have heard, there are quite a lot of myths going around about Lincoln's beliefs, why the war was really fought, among other things. And I'm inclined to believe much of it, because I understand human nature.<br /><br />There are numerous problems with lower-income African-Americans in our nation today. I have witnessed them firsthand. It annoys me to no end to see black people portrayed as complete victims and deified on film. That just is not true. Some of the most racist people that I've ever met were black, but I will not go into it. I will not state my exact heritage, but I look Arabic or East Indian, but I'm mixed, and am part black. I was born and lived in another country that had a sizable black population. I've worked with many American blacks in the past, and their attitude leaves much to be desired. I understand why there is so much racism against them in America. So it enrages me to see liberal advocates, politicians and Hollywood directors, writers and actors portray African-Americans as perpetual victims, portrayed as angels. This is not an accurate depiction. An accurate depiction would display their abhorrence for education, family values and safe, properly run communities, organizations and businesses. Now, bear with me, I am not talking about all of them, but quite a few. Quite a few. It's a cultural problem. White people have nothing to do with it, and believe me, I would not hesitate to address this if it applied.<br /><br />That was one thing that bothered me, but since the rest of the film was simply atrociously written and edited, I could not finish it. It's justbad movie-making. Spielberg is an action movie director. That is what he is best at. When he does movies like Amistad or Lincoln, his weaknesses as a film maker are massively exposed. Despite the fact that masses of sycophants and film snobs will pretend to like these movies at the beginning, they will not stand the test of time and will soon be forgotten. Lincoln was torture to watch, and I could not imagine any school teacher showing this to their kids, because it is an ultra-boring political procedural and not even a decent movie about Lincoln's life. It was Oscar bait, through and through.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book struck a chord with me because I was born in 71 and I'm not sure if it would be as addicting if you wouldn't growing up in the 80s.  For those who do remember their first Atari 2600 with love, this book is a bible.
1451695187|5.0|This is a book about a man who experienced an NDE (Near Death Experience).<br /><br />Now I do realize that many people do not believe in such things, and even feel NDE's are not of God. I am of the belief that they are real and that they do happen.<br /><br />First I had been told by an 80 year old elderly woman of her deceased husband's previous NDE. He had hovered over his own dead body and turned and saw a bright light. He was then told that there was much left for him to do and that he must return. Indeed he did have much to do for he was a farmer who had never given his wife knowledge of any of the books. When he returned he taught her all about everything she needed to know and following this he died.<br /><br />Last fall now...I had a good friend experience a NDE following a heart attack. THEN...one day when I was at the bank...I was compelled to tell a man, \\"Jesus loves you.\\" I did just that but then was compelled once again to go back to him and say, \\"I just want you to know that I am not in the habit of telling just anyone that Jesus loves them.\\" He got all excited and told me to go outside to his vehicle and to tell his wife this. That he had just gotten her out of the hospital from having a heart attack. Well I went outside and did share this with her. She got all excited and told me that she'd just had a NDE where she even got to see her deceased son!!!<br /><br />So yes. I guess you would say that the Lord has gotten my attention and given me faith to believe in NDEs.<br /><br />I was drawn to this book I believe by the Holy Spirit. A man had requested that the director of the library where I work purchase it. When it landed in my hands I felt it was a \\"must read\\" for me.<br /><br />This man, Eben Alexander, M.D is \\"A highly trained neurosurgeon who had operated on thousands of brains in the course of his career....\\" So you could say his view of NDE's was quite scientific and he did not believe there was such a thing.<br /><br />Read this book to witness his take on things NOW after having a NDE personally.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to you.<br /><br />May the Lord bless you!!!<br /><br /> P.S. You will find that when you bring up the topic of near death experiences that the greater percentage of people you talk to will give you a look that says you are \\"nuts\\" or \\"out there.\\" You will need to go to the Lord for yourself to see what His take is on this. I have found that those sharing such experiences have wonderful and delightful things to bring back to all of us to share about the Lord.(As in this book written by Eben Alexander) Seems a lot of it is on His Love for us. I have decided to...as I have in the past with many other things others don't like or agree with...hold these in my heart and in the secret place of the Most High God...~ess his take on things NOW after having a NDE personally.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to you.<br /><br />May the Lord bless you!!!<br /><br /> P.S.

B008JFUNPK|5.0|I really did not expect much when I sat down in the theater to watch \\"The Croods,\\" but I was blown away by the story and animation and originality. This is a story that is highly relatable, not because it's about cavemen, but because it's about a father who feels like he's losing his family.<br /><br />Eep (Emma Stone) doesn't listen to her father, Grug (Nicholas Cage). Grug, like many dads, is overprotective of his daughter, and Eep has come to resent this because she doesn't like spending all of her time in the cave. She wants to go out into the fresh air and have adventures, but Grug's rule is survival first, which means only going outside when the family needs to eat.<br /><br />Like many teenage daughters, Eep is rebellious and doesn't heed her father's warnings, sneaking out of the cave at night. It is during this night stroll that she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds), and the two soon begin to fall for each other. Eep is obsessed with Guy's ability to make fire, and Guy explains to her that he is on the run from the destruction of the world that's coming, and he's heading for safety. He invites Eep to travel with him, but she refuses, so he hands her a conch and tells her to blow on the shell if she needs him. He then leaves Eep, heading for safety once more.<br /><br />Grug is horrified when he wakes up and discovers Eep missing. He leaves the cave, breaking his own rule, and finds her. He brings her home and she talks about Guy. Eventually, Guy comes back into the picture when what he describes to Eep begins to happen and the Croods' cave is destroyed. Guy comes when he hears the signal, and from this point on Grug is constantly competing with the younger man, trying to keep the family as it once was, trying to keep them from changing and evolving to this new person's mysterious ways.<br /><br />The movie is really touching, and children will love it. There are many funny moments for the kids. This one will not disappoint. A great film for the entire family. Go see it!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case too was a very good value relating to the purchase price.  I would never have paid full price for any Kindle cover.  It too is light enough that it does not put any extra strain on holding it when reading.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|they really need to be nicer to Matthew, though. they put viewers through the ringer. My husband is a fan too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this was interestingly written and it certainly kept my attention with all the twists and turns. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it and didn't want to stop when I was. There were many things to ponder about the relationships in the book, none of which I would consider normal...whatever that is!
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|this was a gift so thats can say on the matter. i knoww the person i got this movie for loved it
B003EY62II|3.0|the guy who plays shaggy was sorta cute. the rest is just plain silly...not bad...but just silly, wouldn't watch it more than once.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|this was a gift so thats can say on the matter. i knoww the person i got this movie for loved it
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|i had no problems with the connection. the movie is okay. has some fun parts-i think the chemistry between the leads is what saved the movie. but it's a little boring, too long, and cheesy. I found myself not being able to watch some parts because they made be cringe from all the cheese.
B0086700CM|3.0|liked it until temple run 2 came out. anybody like the tv show scandal? isnt addictive , i havent missed an episode
B005LAII62|5.0|My kid really enjoyed it. And I enjoyed watching it too. Not for kids under 5 or 6, but still had a sweet message. Shipping was very fast, would buy from this seller again, dvd works perfectly, works like new.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way better then the first temple run. Got sick of looking at the background. since i have nothing else to say i'm going to keep typing to meet the requirement.
B001O51G6C|3.0|I thought this movie would be better. I mean this is a Robert DeNiro movie, but oh well. Shipping was very fast, would buy from this seller again, dvd works perfectly, works like new.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very suspenseful and the story held your interest to the point of not being able to put it down.  The ending was disappointing.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|This is an excellent movie for anyone that likes the Hannibal Lecter series.  The movie didn't disappoint in the least
B007V2UGPE|4.0|What can I say pretty fun and relaxing, like games where it is possible to level up. Give it a test run
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very entertaining and had to get the full version!great effects and graphics.looking forward to playing the rest of this game!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I was glad I order this I did not know had behind the scene extra which made me like the album more.....high recommend this classic
B00846REIS|5.0|I love the way both characters connected upon meeting each other for the first time. Gideon plainly stated his intentions to Eva and normally, I thought that she would be angry at this blatant outburst but this excited her. They ended up having plenty and plenty of sex and Eva matched his every move, not backing down. She surely took him by surprise in showing how freaky and kinky she is.  They both have some very bad life experiences  that need to be ironed out with a lot of psychological help and Eva's bi-sexual best friend Carey is no better. What happened to Gideon why he behaves the way he does? will Carey and Eva continue to be friends after what happened? Will Eva ever get over her nightmare of what happened to her? Will her father ever find out and if he does, what will he do seeing that he is a cop? Will her mom and stepfather continue to keep tabs on Eva? I can hardly wait to read the follow-up.<br /><br />Good reading, I enjoyed it very much.
1451695195|5.0|I wanted to read this book since came out but I finally got to it and was not disappointed......I even passed it forward to a friend that is how much I believed in this book.....plus very easy read

0240815807|5.0|I had read articles by Mike Senior in pro magazines and always enjoyed them. This book is a real course on how to be a top notch recordist. There is work to be done, but it will get you the sound you are looking for if you are prepared to put in the time.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|The game glitches and will not allow you to steer the car. Graphics are great tho. If the glitch was fixed it would receive a higher rating.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I like this movie though. I read the book series with my kids well before this movie came out in theaters and was disappointed in the adaptation - too much that sets up the rest of the series was left out - but I found that this movie is a good stand-alone film (every time I hear Lady Gaga's Poker Face, I want to watch again!). I look forward to the release of the of Sea of Monsters over the summer.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very easy to get into awesome retro game. I've always liked galaga style games and this one definitely gets the job done right.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|always look forward to seeing the next episode and how  The Story turns out. wish the series would have lasted longer
B00170MYIS|3.0|a little costly and it doesn't seem to hold the charge as well as the original battery that came with the camera.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Enough said, Rush still keeps on rocking.  The Garden and the Wreckers are some of my favorite songs. Would recommend it to any TRUE Rush fan out there.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|We watched this with the kids one night and it was a great story.  Extremely entertaining and beautiful visually.  Must watch!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app everyday to check how the weather is going to be at night and during the day.  I mostly like the simplicity and ease of use on my first generation Kindle Fire.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|This album blew me away. Every single track rocked. By far one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. I went with the vinyl to help bring out the music in a way only vinyl can. It was well worth the money, besides, the album comes with a free download.
B00AN0KGWE|3.0|The show itself is one of the best I've seen in a while.  The streaming quality on Amazon leaves a lot to be desired even with fast Internet. Remember to register digital copy before the end of March as coupon expires at the end.
B002EXEGTW|5.0|This was a great movie and the Amazon.com streaming process couldn't have been easier.  Just enter your PIN on the TV app and it is ready to go!
0553801473|5.0|While people have complained about the amount of different characters, this book gives you more insights to some of the characters from previous books.  Now, if only we can guess who the three dragon riders are going to be.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great flashlight app.  I don't always have a flashlight when I need it, now I hardly ever need a flashlight  I use this app instead.  Love it
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Would recommend to all my friends.Very fun when you are in a basement and looking for the bathroom in the dark.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|my nice was so happy with this toy... She loves lego friends and I found this set in Amazon, she was very excited when she received it.
B0086700CM|2.0|it stays the same speed throughout the game I like it but I wouldn't get it even if its free get the second if u really want to get it the secound one goes faster
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This book was fast paced. It has me guessing all the way up to the end. I recommend this book.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Tom Hooper did an excellent job with this film. He took on quite the feat, trying to capture one of the most epic and moving musical ever on broadway and turning it into a movie. With so many ways that this could have gone tragically gone wrong, I believe he succeeded in capturing the magic, from the cast, to the sets, to the music.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, playing Jean Valjean, and Anne Hathaway, playing Fantine, made some very trying life style changes to make this movie succeed so that you really get pulled into the story. I really believed them to be the characters they played.  Both of them have amazing voices that rose goosebumps on my skin. I was captivated by them at every turn.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried shocked me with her high range and the delicacy with which she portrayed Cosette.<br /><br />I think the only part that disappointed me was Russell crowe as Javert. While he's a great actor and he has a surprisingly good voice, I was not a captivated by him. I often felt a little disconnected with his character as though he wasn't as interested in playing Javert. He has certainly done a lot better with getting into character in other movies than he did with this one.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this album and agree that it is one of DM's best ever. It seems like each of their albums has a different spirit about it and this one is quite extraordinary. Synth and blues how robust!  After hearing the bands interview I can see why it is so important to try new things and explore creatively. The lyrics tell tales of our place in the universe, romance, honesty, drama, inner life, pain, redemption, and dose of erotic!<br />I was also delighted to hear Martin's voice behind Dave's in much more songs, they compliment each other so graciously. Another intriguing facet was the sci-fi sound elements in certain parts of the songs...Innovative.<br />This album is not predictable by any means, its like none other, though it has fragments of yesteryear early eighties synth beats and echoes of Faith and Devotion, it is a testimony of how far this band has come and how their still here treating us.. the fans with another unusual and provocative audio and heartfelt trip.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We love this movie. I am so glad we bought it. My kids love it. It is a great family movie.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Arrived on time!!!  Price was right!!! My grand kids got me hooked on the Twilight Saga and I thought I should have the complete set for them
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was Amazing!!!  I don't enjoy going to the theater but love to watch good hole some movies and this was one of the BEST movies I have seen in a long time!!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|The book deals with a very serious and sensitive issue, i.e. wife abuse. Unfortunately, it is poorly written with the vocabulary of a fifth-grader. The plot twists, with the exception of maybe one, are all predictable. The story might hold your attention but as a book it is void of literary merit.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I always enjoyed the story of Tom Sawyer but I had always been somewhat partial to Huck Finn tale though. Both are great to read and get some of Mark Twains wisdom.
B004UPANGM|4.0|Terrific horror. Ahead of its time when it came out. Sam Raime was a genius. The witch in the cellar gave my kids nightmares!
1878424319|5.0|I was loaned this book from a friend, and loved it so much that I decided to get one for myself to keep.
B005LAII80|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, short, to the point and action from start to finish, if your into action movies not lookin for too much depth its a solid pick
B009AMANBA|5.0|Some may point out minor historical inaccuracies, but this film is still a remarkable achievement for how marvelously it humanizes the historical giant that is Abraham Lincoln. The weight and responsibility that pressed down on this great man is portrayed magnificently, and no matter what one thinks of the choices he made, one recognizes the gravity and severity of the situation he was placed. Needless to say, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is simply incredible, bringing genuine life and feeling to a person we know simply as a marble statue in D.C. Lincoln is a monumental film precisely because Steven Spielberg chooses *not* to portray Lincoln as a legendary figure, but rather as simply a moral man who rose to the challenge that the evil of slavery presented, in a time (like any time) when moral men would prefer to stay seated. \\"Lincoln\\" presents a portrait of a man who did what is right the best that he could as he saw it, which is more than what most of us can say, and for that beautiful and inspiring picture, I salute and thank Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Day-Lewis.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig continues to show why he was chosen to be the next bond, fantastic job and they get better with each one
B00BQBNK04|5.0|The music takes a timeless story and makes it even more spectacular.  I recommend it to anyone, whether or not you've seen the movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Absolutely love it. That's all I can say. You have to use it to love it. Keep up the great works guys . Thank you so much
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works well.  I like the variety of customization.  Really like waking up to my own music.  Weather has been pretty accurate thus far. My favorite is the multiple alarm clocks that you can name or add a note.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Five Stars.<br /><br />This is a great story for all ages. The power of children's beliefs and determination is an inspiration for everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a very entertaining page turner. I was hooked from the first page. This last book really shocked me, I was definitely not expecting what happened in this book. I loved the theme of this and it was just an amazing read. I recommend this to anyone you should read this its awesome!
B0063IH60K|5.0|better than other solitaire apps i have played. easier and more options. the undo button is easy to access also.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is fun game. This one I like very much.  Some times I run my Kindle to were I have to stop and put it on charge.  So, if I put the charger on I can keep playing.  Fun, fun, fun.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I chose this rating because I loved the book. I am particularly interested in past Kings and Queens of England, and I would recommend this book to anyone who shares the same interests. It is a well written book, and a great series. The only problem I had is not being able to tell easily in which order to read the books.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was really amazing. Kept my attention. Really more for young adults thought. I still enjoyed it. I recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are so great I've read them over and over again.  I wish the movies could compete even slightly to them.  I was disappointed with some of the actors chosen for key parts, I had other pictures in my head. Some key details are completely left out, like Peetas leg being lost.
B00821OX98|5.0|waiting for season 3 - want to watch more seasons.  Too many words required in review.  Just let us rate the movie.
B000M341QO|5.0|Action packed movie and we enjoyed watching it.  Dicaprio is a very talented actor and does a good job in this movie.
0345529057|5.0|Fast delivery, much early than exepected and the quality was ok ! Nothing to complain about, all four books in there in great condition
B008XBASVY|3.0|I really like Chris Colfer as an actor, so I thought I'd give this one a shot. My one complaint is that even though Carson is witty, he's a bit too flamboyant for one to believe he's some sort of asexual.
B008X5CMCS|3.0|Movie is nice to look at.  It starts well, and I thought it would be a good action flick.  Unfortunately it bogs down with a muddy plot.  The lead actor (playing Authur) isn't very likeable or king like.  I would have liked to see more of Patrick Stewart.  Finally the movie is too long.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I log on to it, it doesn't respond, and then it backs me out to the home screen. I have so Much Stat on that game I don't want to delete it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this ap.  I haven't tried to use it to sell anything yet.  For buying it couldn't be better.  I can access everything and navigation it simple.
B005LAII12|4.0|Not as funny as most people made it out to be, but it was funny. Cute movie to just sit down and relax to.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Love this series! Makes you laugh ,cry ,and sit on the edge of<br />Your seat to read what is next.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Haha, this movie is GREAT! If you are looking for a good laugh, I highly recommend this movie. Fat Amy is the best. At the end, I didn't want it to stop! Great movie. :)
B0074VA2T2|5.0|We are big fans of the Very Hungry Caterpillar book. This app replicates the art of the book beautifully. My almost 3 year old son loves to play and can easily do level 1. With 5 levels of play my son will be able to enjoy this for another year or two. Highly recommend for toddlers who are just learning how to count.
1878424319|5.0|It is an amazing book.  Very true but will be a challenge to achieve life in that order.  I will certainly give it a shot.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|I was looking for a touch screen painting or drawing app for my almost 3 year old. This app works very well on my Kindle Fire, and my son can 'fingerpaint' easily. But when he wants to switch to a clean screen he does need a little help. Will definitely keep as I'm sure he will be able to easily navigate when he gets just a bit older.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I personally think that it needs buckets and more lava on every map so you can make a garden fertilized, and you can get obsidian!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. But I am having a problem with the social media option. I have not been able to visit any other reserves yet. Hopefully the Gameloft people will get it fixed soon. Other than that I am very happy with this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's kinda like temple run with out the turning off the device while you play.It's about of fun and lots of updates that are super amazing.
B00004XQ83|4.0|This is a movie I like to see about once a year<br />so I wanted to have my own copy.  Crazy story<br />with offbeat characters and wonderful bluegrass/<br />gospel type of music.  Not everyone's choice but<br />if you like really offbeat movies such as the ones<br />the Cohen Bros. produce,  you will love this one.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I mean this· This book is funny and awesome and epic and I like the series and you gotta read this book
B00003CXRM|4.0|Very good gospel/bluegrass type of music.<br />I wanted to hear the music not just when I watch<br />the movie.  Do recommend it if you enjoyed the<br />movie and score played throughout the film.
0345803485|5.0|It is adult entertainment most assuredly but its fun wicked and a great read for anyone looking for a fun book to spend the day with when your on your own relaxing.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I am sure this was a challenge to do so tastefully so no lawsuits were created. Wonderful acting.Ben has a great future in the film industry in back of the camera as well as on stage.Thanks for such a great job
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We tried to download this to stream it through my computer, however the streaming feature through Amazon failed miserably. The movie however is great, my daughter loves it, it is entertaining for the entire family, young and old.<br />I would recommend this movie, but buy the DVD/blue-ray, or rent it through iTunes don't try to stream it through Amazon. I sent an email to Amazon regarding this issue. Hopefully they will get it resolved soon.
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|The film was done very tastefully.  Even today there has been alot of discrimination but it has taken 150 yrs to get this far and I personally think things will get better as the older generation dies off and the south relaxes its ways and comes into the 2000  century.
B0064IOZY4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0064IP0SY Living Room Songs]]<br /><br />Sometimes we see a film that moves us beyond tears, and at the closing credits you begin to realize that the music accompanying the film had as much impact on you as the story or the acting, if not more so.  This is that kind of music.  I was looking for something more interesting and complex than \\"ambient music\\", more grounded than \\"new age\\", and performed on actual instruments like piano, violin, viola.  So I read some of the reviews of this, and, having recently added a nice turntable to my living room, I decided to feed it with some new music.  I am so happy that I did, because this music is extraordinary.<br /><br />I am sitting in my living room, listening to this vinyl EP (which comes with a DVD and digital download instructions), staring out the front window at the bleak March afternoon, the monochromatic sky visible through the equally monochromatic woods, and I'm happy just doing this.<br /><br />Consider this a very, very strong recommendation.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I've been playing modern combat games ever scence modern combat 2. this is by far the best I have ever played and is going to be hard to beat. but the only thing I have to ask is... where is the update with the new weapons for us kindle fire users? the &quot; Tiger&quot; and the &quot; Compact 665&quot; r 2 guns in that new update that IOS has but we don't?!?!? please put out that update soon please.<br />thank u.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put this down.  It was better than the movie.  Wish I would have read the book before I seen the movie.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought &#34;Defending Jacob&#34; was very well written and was definitely a page turner.<br />I couldn't put it down. I also liked the surprise ending. I did however find it a little depressing.<br />I guess I enjoy books that have a happy ending.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed Ian Rankin and the Rebus series.  As it turns out, this latest book is my first foray.  I usually like to read these books in order, but I have no choice but to start at the beginning and mow them down.  That's how good STANDING IN ANOTHER MAN'S GRAVE is.<br /><br />Drunk and dissolute, Rebus is off the force and is working as a civilian in the cold case division.  When a woman appears at his door searching for a retired Detective who was helping in the case of her daughter's disappearance some years back, Rebus gets intrigued with her theory that a serial killer may be on the loose.  Rebus bird-dogs the case.<br /><br />It's a solid plot with quite a few surprises and it's full of vivid characters.  Though the ending doesn't quite add up, it's easy to recommend STANDING to other crime fiction junkies.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|OR for the Kindle Fire readers, it's a \\"Finger Tapper\\".  Great read, I love a book that I can't put down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game keeps you entertained with different things to do. Plus it being free makes it that much more awesome.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This Movie was great!  Great visual effects!  Great Quality.  I can't wait for the next one to come out in December!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was a enjoyable and fascinating book. I really like it and am glad I read it before I watch the movie. Books are always better.
B009RH9J7W|2.0|I like the look and feel of the case.  The fit of the kindle into the base is also good.  However, when you set the case down the cover does not lay flat.  If you carry it in your hand like a book, it feels like the cover is putting a lot of pressure on the kindle screen.  To me, it looks like the spline is not wide enough.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Very unique and fluid reading. I enjoyed this on vacation. Simpler than it seems but very fascinating and entertaining book.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|I watched this with my husband and three children ages 13 and younger.  They had never seen poverty such as this in the United States.  It was an excellent portrayal of the challenges of those in our own history.  In a day where we can take so much for granted, this was a great reminder of how things used to be and the human heart.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|\\"Visions\\" is easily my favorite record to come out in the past year, perhaps longer.  When I first heard Grimes, I was a bit put off by the vocals, but something about the music and Claire's aesthetic kept me coming back to try it again.  Eventually, I was hooked.  Her music and beats are so poppy and catchy, yet a whole original beast of their own.  I don't know how she will top this one.  Not a bad song on the album.<br /><br />It's totally unique, original, gorgeous, and fun.  Give it a try, there's really nothing quite like Grimes.
B008HK3TXK|5.0|I know there are a million accessories companies are selling in order to get you to spend, but I find this case a must have. First it works as a stand if you are watching a movie or just wanting to plop it on your lap and type. Second, it protects your Kindle in case it slips out of your hand (and trust me mine has on a few occastions). I liked the earthy colors as opposed to all girl/female accessories having to be bright pink for whatever reason.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I finally found an alarm I like...works great on the kindle fire. I use it every morning...get it you will not be sorry.
B0011WL8MK|4.0|It's a fun/semi-serious movie that deals with a very dark time in our history. It's certainly a good &#34;watch&#34;. Not really a movie that will please everyone but everyone really should watch it.
B009AOFNU4|1.0|can't get it to work at all.  no clear instructions.  there are more instructions in foreign languages than english, and print is so small I cannot read it.  Had to get my son, and he says there is no clear instructions for installation.  no instructions for installation or for operating
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Didn't enjoy this at all, but hesitated giving only one star because \\"hate\\" was a rather strong description. It was not what I expected from promotional interviews, etc. Great actors in a peculiar, depressing storyline.
0679720200|4.0|it was good.. clean and not looking old good quality i liked it a lot very useful to me.thanks for it
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It fixed my problem of my Kindle going from one page to another and then another without stopping at any of them.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Although there may be discrepancies between the movie and what actually happened it didn't take away from how powerful and socially relevant this movie is. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody!!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Time runs out too quickly, and I don't know all the symbols to play any faster. I'm glad this game was free for my Kindle
1451638450|5.0|My very favorite writer, writing about my favorite subject, just from a different compass point. She never fails to satisfy.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I loved the way the story was put together over 5 different timer periods. The birthmark link tying the protagonists together worked well too I thought. 5 quite different beings with a similar theme in their lives and then the reprise of the 5 stories at the end. Brilliant. Not everyone will &#34;get&#34; this idea, but if you do, you'll love it as I did. The end message is quite practical and spiritual at the same time.
B008JFUNPK|5.0|This is the perfect family movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed and cried. Dreamworks did an excellent job with this one.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Beautiful. Great. Nice. Everything beautifully wrapped up. Greatly gratifying. Terring you from your wits end wondering what will happen next.
0393345084|4.0|As a white-hot fan of Krugman I was waiting for a deus-ex-machina proposal that never quite descended from on high.  The book is far from a skein of old columns from the NY Times.  For a topic once called &#34;the dismal science&#34; economics in Krugman's hands is surprisingly interesting.  He has not weighted the book down with any of the heavily wonkish explanations that occasionally decorate his column in the Times.  Most appealing to me has always been Krugman's sympathy for those who have suffered most severely from the Great Recession:  those who have lost jobs, houses, spouses, savings, health insurance, sleep, their mental health.  So many of his antagonists appear on television as heartless talking heads who are discussing something as far removed from them as the atmosphere of the planet Neptune.  Bravo, Paul!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I am surprised evey time I watch it.......sometimes jaw droppingly surprised. Love it. If I miss it on TV I go online the next day. Gotta see it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Dark and dirty. Things no one talks about make for a good read. Like a car accident that you can't look away from despite the blood and violence. I do enjoy this author's writing style. Looking forward to more!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!!  Two thumbs up.  If you are looking for a great book I highly recommend Wool!!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I was terribly skeptical when I heard that Tegan and Sara were going through a pop metamorphosis, but they MORE than proved me wrong!! Not only do we get the same insightful lyrics with music strong in truth and individuality, but we can move to it too! DON'T SKIP THIS ALBUM!!! :)
B00005NKK8|4.0|This is an awesome soundtrack and was a Christ,as gift for my father.  He loved it and was super excited to listen to it
B008JOLG7U|4.0|I think I only paid like $1.99 for the whole disc when Amazon was having a special promotion. It has some of my favorite old school JLo on it, things from &#34;Jenny From the Block,&#34; &#34;If You Had My Love,&#34; and both Ja Rule remixes for &#34;I'm Real&#34; and &#34;Ain't That Funny.&#34; And at the price of 1 maybe 2 songs it was definitely a steal. Don't, however, expect to find ALL the HITS on here that you are looking for.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one of best games I have ever played. it<br />teaches great responsibility about taking care<br />of any animal.
B002BWP49C|5.0|... on Amazon to say how much I love this copy!! I had thought there would be a UV copy with it, but that was probably my own misconception! I was able to get this 2-Disc Special Edition AND A 2-Disc Extended Edition of Part 2 for less than I was going to be paying for single disc 2pack I had intended to preorder from Walmart. And I got it MUCH sooner! I believe that even with ordering it days before the Breaking Dawn 2 release date I still received BOTH of them ON the release date!! :)
B002VWNICW|5.0|Excellent movie if you have not seen it yet I would highly recommend it. The blu ray version makes it that much better.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Again, this was a steal for the price as I got the whole LP for $1.99 through an Amazon promotion. (What can I say, Amazon knows I love my music!) ;) I already knew that I would like at least a couple of the songs on here because I had heard him perform on SNL, but was skeptical about what the rest of the album would hold because of the third song I had heard from the album. :) But all in all, its more good than bad. Some of it makes me laugh, which I don't know if that is a good thing for Bruno or not, but I'm still enjoying it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great read. Of course you expect the teenage angst relationship and high school drama (everyone has skeletons) but just when you think you have this book figured out, the rollercoaster of unexpectedness takes you for a ride. I FELT every minute of this book as if it was really happening to me and enjoyed the emotion evoking journey. I LOVE, no I LIKED this not so happily ever after! All you need now is the lamp, and the ashtray, and the remote control, and the paddleball game and Dean Holder. :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is regally good, especially for younger children.  It tends to work better on the Kindle Fire HD, but there's not much of a difference.  You can also friend your friends that have this app.
B000MV9026|5.0|We love this movie in our house and so I had to buy it! It came wrapped in the shrink wrap plastic and the disk was in perfect condition.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Reminds me of childhood.  Im a 80's kid.  Shows like the Jeffersons, Cosby show, Masters Of The universe, Thundercats, G.I. Joe, Wrestling, and movies like the Breakfast Club.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I rented this movie with no idea what it was about. Within 10 minutes I had to literally pause the movie to register everything! Great story and Denzel does an amazing job with his character. I purchased the movie and cannot wait to watch it again!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|It's a disc that requires many repeat plays....then you hear his beautiful voice and his gentle themes of love, heart and soul. Although I was hoping for a few ventures into his talented harder rock guitar presentations, I found the new versions of two old favorites to be great. So many great songs and after 45 years the journey goes on......JH is hall of fame. Looking forward to solo concert this August....Justin I will visit for my ..83 moodies experience.Thanks for pushing on......
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Language  of Flowers was a great book,  a quick read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down at night.
B006CHML4I|1.0|As I already own two Seiko watches I had no hesitation in ordering another one for casual wear.  When this watch arrived if would not start ticking no matter what I did.  I followed the instructions to the letter and it was Dead On Arrival.  It's on its way back.  My father was a watchmaker and always thought very highly of Seiko watches.  My other Seiko watches are exceptional timepieces but, as you might expect, they cost substantially more.  I noticed that the automatic mechanism on this watch says it's made in Malaysia which probably speaks volumns about it's quality.  This watch was a disappointment all around.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|A very sad, heartfelt drama.  You can't imagine this ever happening but we read about it in the newspapers too often.
141694737X|5.0|My 11-month-old daughter simply sees this book and gets excited.  Between the animal pictures and the flaps that she can move, this is a fantastic book for a baby.  My only issue is that for some reason, all the animals are male.  I guess the eponymous zoo didn't have any female animals.  It's not that big of a deal, though, because I simply alternate gender when I read the book aloud.
B00881VLCE|3.0|it's okay. I do like that you can get more backgrounds to choose from, I just wish you could delete the ones it comes with when you first open the app.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great SIM game with an addicting micro transaction mechanic. Slow start and very quest best like Sims Social, however, with great sound effects and quality.  A mini operation genesis.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|after I bought this dvd, I found out that it wasn't america that saved the 6 prisoners but the Canadians who rescued them.  So disappointing.
B00A757EFW|5.0|my son love this game get real hard to high lever but keep your kids busy great game for any kid and adult
B0041D843M|5.0|Easy to read and incredibly informative! Highly recommend this book to anyone truly interested in the nutrition/health relationship. I just finished and will be re-reading again very soon.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|this book was such a romp! original, fast-paced plot. I also give great credit to the translator from the Swedish.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Perfect for any age. My whole family from myself to my 5 yr old daughter plays this game. Easy controls!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book, although a little hard to follow at times...  and I realize Jaycee is no professional author... but overall, this book was sad, heartwarming and absolutely inspiring!  What she went through and her outlook on life is just amazing.  A beautiful person inside and out....  someone to admire.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I'd heard snippets from this album on NPR and was impressed by the variety of musical artists that Duane Allman had worked with.  Am waiting for the appropriate rainy day to settle down with this album.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great story, with great characters.... I enjoyed it and couldn't put it down!  A must buy for sure!
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Have always loved this movie.  Finally bought a copy and enjoy it every time I watch it :) That band on the pier is unforgettable :)
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|Still digging her beautiful voice.  But what's up with the rap?  The Lamar track is just obnoxious.  It's as if Yo-Yo Ma suddenly said, \\"Hey! I need more cowbell.\\"
B003HKN52U|5.0|Anne Rice classic.  Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Louis the whiner, Antonio Banderas as a more mature but equally intense version of Armand.  Who knew Tom Cruise would make such a good Lestat ?
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Not nearly as homoerotic as I had been led to believe... Lots of great quotables from Lord Henry. Highly recommended.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|We got this for my father-in-law and he brings it everywhere with him. It's nice and bright and very handy.
B000TPXMCO|5.0|I was a fan of CC the first time I heard them.  This one especially,because I love Helen Terry's voice!  She was always such a standout on their recordings. I listen to this constantly.  So happy I found it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a sky fan and I love budder anyway I love this app its da best man I ain't obeezy
B00AE2J93I|4.0|It wasn't the best movie but I would watch it again during Halloween. I felt like the previews in the movies gave the entire story away. I already knew what was going to happen before watching it.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I am such a big fan of Lee Child. I am so glad I found his series of books. They are all Great in their own way.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I didn't think I would like this at first. Now it's one of my all time favs. Imagination was brought to life in brave
B001NHNG64|5.0|Don't hesitate to read any of Lee Child's book they all have their unique differences and plot developements. Don't pass it up.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Absolutely loved it. Was a great movie. Couldn't stop laughing. Will be purchasing very soon. Will be great to watch over & over again.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited away is yet another masterpiece by hayao miyazaki. I honestly don't think he ever forgot what it is like to be a child. This allows him to create believable characters. The story of spirited away is about a little ten-year-old girl named chihiro. The story begins when her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of a large red building. After further investigation, the family guesses that it is an abandoned amusement park. The family begins to explore and discover a little strip of restaurants. One of the restaurants has a lot of delicious food set out (freshly cooked I might add). Chihiro's parents begin to gorge themselves on the food saying that they will pay whoever made the food when they return. Chihiro, afraid they might get in trouble eats none of the food. Instead, she begins to explore the park. She finds a bridge with a train running under it. As she looks down over the bridge, a young boy appears out of no where. He tells her to hurry and get out of the park before the sun sets. Chihiro runs back to her parents and finds that they have been turned into pigs. She runs away to hide but the same young boy (named haku) finds her. He tells her that the park is a vacationing resort for the spirit world and that the only way she may survive and get her parents true form back is to get a job at the park. Chihiro ends up getting a job at a bath house run by the witch Yubaba. Chihiro has to learn responsibility and bravery before she can ever get home. It is an amazing movie and I rcommend itto anybody who loves anime and even those who don't. I loved it so much that I bought it with my babysitting money. If you like this movie, some others you may enjoy are Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo, or Princess Mononoke.
1401937519|4.0|I really enjoyed this autobiography, especially since it was written by someone raised believing in reincarnation... which she came to realize wasn't real in our linear time world. Though my own NDE experience was not nearly as extensive as the author's, I felt that we had definitely experienced the same place. I hope to see her interviewed in the future. As someone who works with people dealing with cancer, I would love to be able to understand more fully how the author was able to cure herself of her devastating cancer.

B005P4PAVK|1.0|The forced humor in this show is retarded to begin with.  Lousy overracting,  cartoony facial expressions.. This mind numbing show tries to stick a punchline  in every 2 seconds... Pathetic forced garbage.. I guess 12 year olds like it.

B000VZUWZW|1.0|This is quite possible most annoying show I have ever seen.. Possibly the corniest humor ever!  People actually watch this? This show is for who? Eleven year olds?  Seriously, this \\"show's\\" comedy is so darn forced and fake that it becomes annoying within a matter of a few minutes..  And THAT.. is something to laugh at.

B0040UAYI4|1.0|It's not as simple as plugging in and playing.you must configure the eagle eye and calibrate controls over and over. I bought this item for bf 3 . I called eagle eye for help. In doing so the tech guy told me eagle eye works poorly with bf3. Vehicles and such don't work so well. I still use my Ps3 controller and eagle eye sits a pile of wires.

0882847953|5.0|If you are Drummer you must get this book. This is one of the Bibles of drumming. If you're taking drumming seriously, seriously get this book. Work through it slowly. If you're a teacher, you need this for yourself and your students. If your student, you should ask your teacher to walk you through this book. After going through this book look at my other reviews and there are two other books you need to find which you will see. Go through the Bibles of drumming, properly, like everybody else, and you too can get anywhere you want in drumming. The guys you pay a lot of money for at-large stadiums who drum, all did the same thing. Follow the road to success in you to will be successful. Do not reinvent the wheel.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy continues.  I was very skeptical about this movie at first.I thoyught it was just going to be a remake of the original Bourne movies.  I was wrong.  This movie is nothing like the original movies and completely holds your attention throughout the movie.  Action packed, great acting with a riviting story line.  This is a must have movie to go along with your Bourne collection
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I saw the movie at the theater and I liked it. I enjoy my DVD player and don't plan to get a Blue Ray player until my DVD player dies.<br />I want to see the extra stuff.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|A must have movie for ALL the Avenger fans out there.  Action packed and entertaining.  What more can you ask for !!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Just got this album from Japan. I must admit, they changed their sound dramatically comparing to Xandria's previous releases. One thing remains the same, though - strong melody . Heavier, more powerful, but very melodic symphonic metal. From start to finish. Soul Crusher is the only track I could live without. The rest of the album is extremely addictive & reminds me my favorite band \\"Nightwish\\" with Tarja. \\"The Dream Is Still Alive\\" track is just outstanding. So is \\"Call of the Wind\\". I bet, everyone who like this kind of music (Nightwish, Within Temptation, Therion, etc.) would find the favorite track or two on this album. It is totally subjective.<br />I am glad I have ordered this CD from Japan as it has a bonus track \\"When The Mirror Cracks\\" which is not a filler. It stands tall with the rest of the album.<br />Great music, source of energy & positive emotions.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up watching the original series and I was not excited at the idea of new actors taking on the roles of characters that are so well-known. After reading good reviews, I finally saw the movie in the theater and returned to see it again a few days later. I have just watched it twice on DVD. This is a movie meant for a big screen, but it is still incredible on a small-screen - especially if you turn the lights down and the sound up.<br /><br />I won't be exhaustive or get into plot-points - that has been done by many others. I will say that the characters are true to their nature without being a parody of the original actors. Some mannerisms are winked at, then we just go on with the movie. I have seen many, many movies or TV shows that deal with time-travel, but none have handled the logical leaps as well as this film. I was completely blown away by the special effects and the sound of this movie. Both completely suck the viewer in and I am left every time with my jaw hanging open.<br /><br />If you are a trek fan and still haven't seen this, I think that you will be pleasantly surprised. Just go into it knowing that it is a re-boot.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|too much hesitation and glitches on my kindle fire  ended up deleting it. too bad because it looked pretty cool graphics wise.

6305278016|5.0|Kirk Douglas plays a NEw York detective named Nick who in the past took money to try to cope with his divorce and child support, now its come back to haunt him. Him and his partner witness a Yakuza named Saito murder a man in New York and he and his partner got orders to escort him to Osaka. They make it to Japan and lose Saito, making matters worse when it comes to them and the japanese. The two team-up with Massa a Tokyo police man and begin to track their quarry, taking them throughout Tokyo. They begin to teach Massa and his superiors their knowledge, that this about counterfeiting. Charlie, Nick's partner is killed by Saito and his men making him and Mass become partners trying to get Saito off the street. Nick learns something about honor and discipline and Mass learns about guts and how to be unpredictable. But the best scene is him and Massa walking into the police station with Saito between them, and all the cops just stand up as they pass amazed that two of the biggest screw-ups they've ever met and the most wanted Yakuza in all Japan right between them. Definately a great movie.

B0089XH38M|5.0|I've been using AVG for years on my desktop and lap top computers. When I saw it for mobile applications, I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with AVG, it is a free virus/malware/trojan protection for personal use (for company use, there is a fee - cheaper than the others and works better). I switched to AVG because the other antivirus software REALLY slows down your computer and they are major memory hogs. AVG does not slow things down, is not a memory hog AND it updates daily instead of once a week, keeping your virus protection at peak performance.<br /><br />It's free, what have you got to lose?

That would probably work as well as this did at cleaning apps.

B005LAII4E|2.0|When the first live action G.I. Joe film, The Rise of Cobra, hit theaters in 2009, it was met with a high amount of negative criticism - and with good reason.  For many of us, G.I. Joe cartoon and action figures were a memorable part of our childhood, so it's only natural to be protective of a film that carries the name G.I. Joe - yet bared little resemblance to the characters associated with it.  Nearly four years later, a whole lot has changed in the world.  Suddenly, Channing Tatum, who played Duke in the first film, has become a household name.  His popularity has catapulted him into several starring roles, but The Rise of Cobra was still bad enough to go with the decision to gut the entire cast from the first film (partially including Tatum) and starting fresh with a new cast.  In the sequel, G.I. Joe Retaliation, Dwayne Johnson takes the reigns.<br /><br />Directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D & Justin Bieber: Never Say Never), G.I. Joe Retaliation stars Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, the new leader of the G.I. Joes.  Disguised as the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce), Zartan launches an assault on the G.I. Joes, wiping most of them out, including their leader, Duke (Channing Tatum).  Now, Roadblock is forced to take command and lead the remaining Joes, including General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cortona) against the newly freed Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) and his nuclear weapon-wielding army.  Lee Byung-hun, Ray Stevenson, and Arnold Vosloo also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Let's jump right into this and start with the bad news first.  For months now, the rumor was Channing Tatum's character, Duke, was gettin' the ax early on in Retaliation.  Of course, Tatum is a popular guy these days, so early test screen audiences didn't handle his early demise  very well, which allegedly forced the delay of the film (with the guise of needlessly and pointlessly converting the film to 3D), thus leading to additional Tatum scenes.  In any event, Tatum still bites the dust early on in the film, right when all hell breaks loose.  His poorly written death (which is clearly evident in the trailer) is one of the most disappointing scenes of the film, even though it sets the \\"retaliation\\" theme into high gear.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this sequel still follows a similar plot-line as its predecessor (ending in the same uneventful fashion) - thus bringing up some pretty bad memories in the process.  The Rise of Cobra dealt with Cobra being in control of a horrific weapon that could destroy a city, which eventually led to the destruction of France.  And, in the sequel, here we are again with Cobra in control of nuclear weapons, which eventually leads to the destruction of another major worldly city.  The action in these films is great, but at some point you'd think these writers would find something better to do than destroy cities.  For all the excitement within this film, it's still the bothersome repetitiveness that stands out.  And, speaking of standing out - James Carville makes a cameo, but still no Sergeant Slaughter?  Come on, man.<br /><br />Despite its lows, G.I. Joe Retaliation has a few highs, and it starts with the ensemble cast.  Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, who seems to be everywhere these days, takes command of the Joes with his usual \\"boots to asses\\" mentality.  Johnson provides a magnetic charm, especially in his scenes with Tatum.  The chemistry between the pair made for some good, light-hearted laughs and it's a shame it didn't last longer.  With Tatum out of the picture, The Rock is now the clear-cut leader, displaying the enthusiasm and powerful leadership qualities needed to command a high profile cast of this caliber, which includes action guru Bruce Willis, along with Adrianne Palicki, and D.J. Cotrona.  Together, these characters come out guns a blazin' - providing a ton of action using some pretty high tech gismos, and a pretty agile tank.<br/><br />The bottom line is this film's franchise is a mess.  Still, Retaliation is superior to The Rise of Cobra (although, it didn't take much).  Even though Retaliation features a new cast, the film still suffers from the same outstanding problems of the original:  plot direction and character development.  It would have been nice to see some more continuity in the script, other than the return of two silent ninjas (with relatively meaningless roles) and a brief appearance by Channing Tatum.  Seriously, would it have killed them to bring back Joseph Gordon-Levitt?  Regardless, if you're a true G.I. Joe supporter, go see the film - but if you aren't, and you weren't a fan of the first film, there's still not a whole lot more to see here.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C<br />FNDNreview.com/><br />The bottom line is this film's franchise is a mess.

B00BF11STU|2.0|I thought this film was a major disappointment. It could have been a great movie but I thought it was poorly edited and essentially boring. The acting was also not very good.  An uninspiring effort overall.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Finally there is an album I can listen to from start to end!  Definitely not a one hit wonder, there are many beautiful tracks in this album.  Ellie's voice and music are unique and beautiful.

B00197YZ7M|5.0|This goes a little deeper than the average chick-flick. This is a movie about feelings, mixed emotions and time.<br />Meryl Streep as always is at her best portraying a foreign born wife living in rural America and Eastwood a professional photographer just passing through. Two command performances.<br />While I offer up no spoilers, I do wish that the end had of turned out differently but if it had, then the total human experience of their characters would have been lost amongst so many other love stories.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good graphics. challenging enough to keep my interest, but not too hard. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a more mature game that makes you use your brain.

B0071XO8RA|1.0|I am a huge fan of science fiction in general, and alternate past/alternate near-future in particular.  I wanted to like this book, but I ended up hating it.  Why?  Technologically, the universe as described is not literally plausible; there is no way that a society which is so small and at the same time so secretive or unwilling to share knowledge could maintain the infrastructure they have.  Societally, I think people are not nearly so easily kept in check, it would be a much more unstable society than depicted.  On the level of individual characters, the motivations often don't make sense or are extremely exaggerated.  All of these things, however, are necessary for the author to develop the morality tale that this is.  It seems clear that he is not exploring a possible future, but rather presenting an allegory of the present - which may or may not fit, depending on your views, but which is in any case extremely overstated, in a way that detracts from the book.  The overall atmosphere is oppressive and claustrophobic, which is no doubt intentional.<br /><br />The \\"bunker that survives the end of the world\\" plot has been done many times, from the hilarious (\\"Sexmission\\") to the dead serious (\\"The Day After\\").  This is not one of the best versions: it spends too much time preaching to actually think about any \\"what-ifs\\".  Skip it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read the first book which was very good, so got the second one. It was equally as good.<br />It was spell binding.
B009RH973I|4.0|I love the case but unfortunately it doesn't have a autosleep feature which sucks. Not sure whether to keep it or not.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|used it on my Iphone - Now have installed it on my Kindle Fire HD.  The only thing i would like to be able to do is to download content and be able to use offline too!
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|Never thought of Dustin Hoffman in mind game type movies, but he did a great job in this one.  It was an entertaining movie that made you follow along or get lost.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Games that require a novel-sized manual can be cool, but sometimes you just want to shoot at stuff, and see stuff explode. This  fun little game that reminds me of scrolling arcade games of the eighties, complete with cartoon action, colors, and an upbeat musical score. It's intuitive enough to pick up almost instantly, but with enough variety in power-ups, backgrounds, and new airplanes to unlock to prevent premature boredom. The controls are a bit clumsy on the Kindle: it's easy to lose track of the joystick direction or fire button, but that's the only notable flaw.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Its a great twist on the age old tale of Cinderella.  The idea was different and not so far fetched that it lost me in the first 10 pages.  Nope this sucked me right in.  A good read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Story, costumes,and time period are superb.  Highly recommend to anyone who likes history.  Love the way they develop the characters.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was not a &#34;can't put it down&#34; read but it was quick. Similar to so many other government spy/assassin novels that are popular now. I did not find anything particularly unique about &#34;the Innocent&#34;. It provided about what I expected.
B009QW85ZU|5.0|Great actors for lead roles. A different take from Thunderball, but similar elements in both. Sean Connery is the best &#34;Bond&#34;.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Wait until it's free.  The guys are good looking but the premise of the movie is weak.  Perfect for someone who actually would go to a male strip club.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was great. It could really make a person interested in mythology. I love books like this and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was very funny.  My children loved this movie.  Plus it had a little romance as well.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My grandson spends a lot of time playing this game...he loves it! Really helps with hand eye coordination, while having fun.
B002XZOZQA|5.0|I love dance. These character's go deep and are amazing. If you love dance you'll love this movie. It has its corney parts but the characters are just great. Just recently saw the stage version that came to stlouis It was amazing too!!!
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Graphics are very good play is very easy nicely done. I would recommend this to any one who likes pool
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It started out slow but once I was into it.  I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Seem like a very excellent movie but video kept messing up. I thought it was my wifi connection but it was working. Sometimes it happens but I lost out cause I couldn't finish viewing the movie. I plan to rent it again on a later time. DISAPPOINTED.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The visual effects were great.  I was immersed in the movie, but I thought that the story line was a little weak.  Maybe I didn't quite get it, but it seemed like it pulled a lot from the Aliens movie series theme.  I am tempted though to watch it again.<br /><br />Jim
006441034X|5.0|I had always love the movie made by Studio Ghibli, and had always wanted to read the book. now I have and now I love both even more! So much plot is left out of the movie but that always happens with book to movie transitions. I will read this again and again.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love this movie, and living in Cleveland it's loads of fun to watch and point areas out where they filmed here.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Insightful view into the restaurant industry...  the immense  labor and preparation, , the personal conflicts, jealousies, not to mention the type of outlandish characters drawn to the business.  In addition I enjoyed the references to other authors and chefs. I've purchased Bill buford's HEAT, another amazing read, and two of Pino Luongo's books, and Buford's refereces led me to more authors including George Orwell  and thus the adventure continues. Anyone who likes to eat, or is interested in the history of food and who likes to cook might want to have  this this book on the shelf.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|The movie arrived within a few days and plays without any problems.  You can't even tell it was a used copy.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|Since I don't have HBO and I don't live in the UK, I'm only familiar with this series because a friend insisted on sharing it with me via illegal download. I'd like to see it again via legitimate means, because I think the people who made the series deserve to make money on it, so I've pre-ordered this DVD, even though there's no release date announced. Maybe there won't be, considering less than a quarter of a million viewers watched its premiere showing on HBO. As you've no doubt heard by now, \\"Parade's End\\" is no \\"Downton Abbey.\\"<br /><br />What it is is the sort of first-class TV adaptation of classic British literature that the British Broadcasting Corporation used to do all the time, and that used to get shown on American public TV when it wasn't too sexy to be edited down for us. \\"Parade's End\\" is not an easy story to follow if you're used to \\"Downton Abbey\\" style costume shows that basically put modern people and situations into corsets and top hats. Tietjens isn't the wicked hypocritical aristocrat we've been taught to expect from a million bodice-rippers and thrillers; he is a gentleman who actually tries to follow the rules that a gentleman is supposed to live by. That this sets him at odds with the society he lives in doesn't make him a freak or an oddball; he's a man for all seasons whose quietly heroic journey is both frustrating and fascinating to follow.<br /><br />The reason for this series' existence, and in my opinion really the only reason to watch it (and what more reason do you need) is to watch Benedict Cumberbatch demonstrate why he's swiftly becoming the most admired British actor of his generation: brilliant, accessible, and ultimately loveable.
1563890410|5.0|The item arrived quickly and with minimal wear (as described).  Well worth the price and I don't mind if the book has been read already, most of my books are used.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I bought this app and started playing immediately. The next day I started feeling under the weather. I've been really sick for 3 days now. It looks like the only ones that will escape total devestation are the people of Canadia. I'm afraid to end the game, and be burdened with apocalyptic guilt. Stop playing, pack your bags, and head north. Its all you can do!
0785162348|5.0|I collect 'art of' books and this one is a beautiful addition to that collection.  It arrived in perfect condition
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus Edition is one of my all-time favorite science fiction novels. This well written novel is suspenseful and thought provoking. I look forward to reading more from Hugh Howey. Good job!
1563890119|5.0|Finally getting around to collecting all the Sandman series!  I have no complaints about the item, it arrived in a timely manner and was just as described.
B000WN4MVS|5.0|this is a classic, this is a classic, this is a classic! if you've never seen this movie please look at before you see the remake!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome cool game for all ages I wish i couldn get more coins and my facebook wouldn't let me sighing in
B000EWBNMS|1.0|Mary Poppins-vs-Poltergeist!  You would be best served by placing this in the achives,under lost and not found!  I donated my paid copy #1 to the local library!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|There is always a but.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this book. The first two book are cracking and would advise anyone to read them.<br />Now this book is good, but it is a bit weak in places and the last chapter or two are not great, only because knowing the people in the book there is no way they would allow certain things to happen - kids visiting mafia type persons etc... though I did love how it ended !
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I was expecting more. I really got tired of the crazy guy. I did a lot of speed reading just to finish the book.
B0031RS69G|4.0|A fantastic read for anyone who enjoys parody of science fiction, religion, culture and just about anything. Warning: Not for the closed-minded
B008IJTFYW|5.0|When my neighbor plays his loud music next door, I turn this app on. The white noise helps drown out everything else so I can study in peace. It sounds great too.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|for a chick flcik its not bad, got it for me and my girlfriend and i actually had a few good laughs out of it!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|The flower song duet from Lackme is worth the whole DVD.  Anna Netrebko is a little rough around the edges on some of her work here
B009VYF5E2|5.0|There are enough twists, turns and action to keep your interest in this fourth season of the series.  If you have watched and enjoyed the previous seasons, this one will not disappoint you.
B0000013G9|5.0|This cd brings back some good memories from the 90's, clearly if you liked it then you will now! Buy it!
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|This album is in alignment with the style and quality of the previous work from this super group.  There are many highlights, but I believe my favorite on this album is High Hopes.  This is a collection that you can listen to over and over and it never gets old.
0525478817|4.0|I just finished this book and I thought it was very well done.  It was my second John Green novel (the first being Paper Towns, next I want to read Looking For Alaska).  While John Green is a great person and an amazing writer, at times I feel that he gets a bit too wrapped up in the symbolic and deeper meaning he puts in his books.  The great \\"classics\\" with symbolic and metaphoric meaning, insert their ideas effortlessly (usually) and their characters hardly ever break \\"the 4th wall\\" to make a point, at times with John Green's books I feel like the characters step out of the story to talk about a new insight they had on life which turns into poetry which pulls them (and me the reader) even more out of the story and the character.  Also, people hardly ever come up with poetic metaphors for life's pleasures and pains - especially 16 and 17 year old teenagers.  Still, his metaphores do make me reflect on his words which is kind of rare in most YA fiction.<br /><br />Its a rather quick read, but not a gripping page-turner, which I have to say is my favorite part of this book.  I really loved the simplicity of the story - nothing earthshatteringly surprising, you-didn't-see-that-coming happens, but even though it's simple, it keeps you hooked and wanting to continue.  The charactes, while not the roundest, most complex I've ever read, had a simple charm that made them likable.  I do agree with other revies saying that the characters weren't totally believable.  Like I said earlier, teenagers are certainly not that poetic or so seemingly \\"perfect.\\"<br /><br />I can't address the cancer subject matter - I don't know much about it.<br /><br />I can't really pin down what made this a 4 star book and not a 5 star one.  I'll just say it this way - I didn't cry at the end.  I cry at anything sad in movies or books, but at the end of this book I didn't feel like I needed to cry.  I found it sad and poignent, but something prevented me from really crying like a lot of people seem to be saying.  I don't know why the book didn't move me to tears, but whatever it was, that's why it gets 4 stars.<br /><br />Certainly one of the best books for YA out there right now, but not quite 5 stars for me.  I love John Green, love this book, and his writing is extrodinary, so I'm certainly glad to own a copy.  A very solid 4 stars and I'd reccommend TFIOS to anyone and everyone!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Get the app it's amazing I mean I love it in the beginning it's good but you can breed dragons win contests all sorts of things.
B000G6BM00|5.0|James Cameron's Aliens(1986) is a great film and a great sequel! It does justice to Alien(1979) and it's also an action packed spectacle. People still quote lines from the movie. Cartoons have poked fun of \\"Hudson\\". Ellen Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) and the Space Marines travel to the planet where the Nostromo found the Space Jockey and the alien eggs. The planet is now crawling with over 600 xenomorph aliens, many dead human colonists and an Alien Queen! Making Aliens was a trial by fire. Most people weren't dying to see an Alien sequel at the time. There were crew members that didn't want to take orders from Cameron. James Horner struggled to complete the music score on time. The film is solid on a technical and artistic level. I first saw the film on CBS TV back in the 1980's. I bought a VHS copy in the 1990's. The DVD version that I bought restored many deleted scenes. Each Alien sequel has struggled to reach the apex that Aliens reached. Movie critic Roger Ebert claims he enjoyed the film, but it took him a while to calm down after watching it. One critic claims that the action scenes felt like a \\"roller coaster on greased tracks\\"! Some of the sets in Aliens were recycled in Batman(1989). Aliens spawned a line of action figures and the critically reviled XBox game Aliens Colonial Marines. I played an Aliens arcade game at a county fair when I was 9 years old. Aliens is a classic sci-fi-horror action film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book as much as the first one but I did!! It was amazing and surprising!! A great read
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game! I'm playing the adventure mode right now and it's awesome! Good graphics and lots of levels.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so much fun. Save your gems! You'll need them. I play this a lot. But it is very addicting but I don't know why. Anyway it's really fun.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|By the time I get to Phoenix, she will be waiting and  I will be gone, this standard is the standard
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was hooked immediately and felt like I was there with Mark Watley all the way. Boy what a ride. Loved every minute of it. I liked that he seemed like a real person . Seemed like I was looking over his shoulder. Recommend this adventure.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I bought this DVD for my daughter who absolutely loves this movie.  Now that I have seen it also, I love it just as much.  The characters are wonderful.  I love the way they dressed &#34;back in the day.&#34; The story line is great also.  You never know how much you miss a person, until they are no longer there.  It pays to treat people with loving kindness.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I love all the Mickey Haller series of books.  And Matthew McConaughey shines! This film had just the right amount of drama, action, and comedy for me.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Not as fast paced as his usual books. No twists and turns, fairly predictable! Disappointed considering the quality of his other books
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|A long slow classic, misunderstood in its day, but full of interest now.  This is the great anti-Western, that wonders what might have been if people had not become less important than profit.  Fine performances and off-beat casting sustained my interest through a rather meandering plot.  Montana and Wyoming look like the Promised Land, so beautiful.  Being a DVD the extra length is less of an irritant and more something to be savoured.
0446672653|5.0|this was the most enjoyable book I have ever read!!! I read it cover to cover without stopping in four and one half hours, with the exception of laughing or crying tears of happiness. everything in this book rang true to the deepest level of my being. I texted my special soul mate five or six times in the first half hour of reading saying, wow! wow! wow! wait until you read this! and when she did read it she did the same - laughed, cried, and texted me five or six times in the first half hour of reading it saying wow! just like I did. she also read it non stop. then we got on the phone and talked about it. that was a few weeks ago and we are still talking about this amazing book! these real life experiences of other souls here on earth are fantastic! if you read this book and are not blown away, don't worry, someday you will be :}  ONLY LOVE IS REAL!!!
B00122J0YW|5.0|The music is beautiful,  The reissue version is crisp and clear, and if you are a fan of Madonna you will very much enjoy these songs.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I have Lots of fun ^^. I love it very much :) I am going to buy The Croods too.
B003O3E4L6|5.0|I had read this book a couple of years ago and thought about it intermittently since then, which is VERY unusual for me.  I read it again and enjoyed the different ways the novel pushed me to think. At the time, I had thought about the parents of the Columbine killers in a kind of abstract way; I now think of parents of those people differently.  It's not a book for pregnant women (at least it wouldn't have been for me when I was pregnant ... too many hormones and too much imagination ran around inside me then) but it's very much worth your time.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It's been a long time since I've been so pulled into a story... Amazing! The romance, the magic, the tragedy and the triumphs! Everything a knowing person loves about life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I had heard quite a bit about this series, and wanted to watch it.  Our tastes in movies are pretty different so it's hard to find something we can both enjoy, but this show really fills the bill.  We watched Season 1 on Netflix and then found that only Amazon had seasons 2 and 3.  This was our reason for joining Amazon Prime, and we now agree it was well worth it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love this series! Ordered a show through Amazon after I missed one when we moved and it wasn't on the main website. No problems, even watching via my phone.<br /><br />Amazon is great customer service with any problems also. They were prompt to address a previous video quality from another purchase.
B009ZNU15C|5.0|This is one of my favorite classic movies but very difficult to find. It was pretty expensive but a very good addition to my collection. Thank you to the seller.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|This a nicely packaged set of workouts that can be done easily at home when you don't feel like hitting the gym or you just want to tone rather than build mass amounts of muscle. Most workouts can be done with just your body and a little floor room. I'm a male with a medium build and enjoy weight lifting at the gym, but I find this great for recovery days and toning workouts. If you think it's too easy, just do the workouts properly by moving slowly through the FULL range of motion and at the maximum time level. Hold for a 3 count at maximum contration and you WILL feel the burn no matter your size or athletic background.
B00AKGG6XY|5.0|Thank you very much for a great movie at a great price. I am very happy with my purchase. I have rated this at a definite 5 star.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I am not happy with the fact that I live in the Chicago area and the forecast video is in Spanish.I will probably delete and save space.
B000GNOM78|5.0|I have been a fan of Bruce Lee since the early seventies. I had to have this on high definition.
B008R6MI8G|5.0|An Intriguing Account Of an historic Irish event. The Irish uprising in 1916 Seeing through the eyes of Michael Collins one of leaders  of the Irish rebellion against Britain's tyrannical brutal oppression.<br />Is sad and sobering Paradox that lead friends and soldiers at arms, to a civil war.Irish guns that  once won victory over the British Empire, were now turned on each other. A bittersweet ending to the Irish Revolution and the birth of the nation.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|This was a book club selection and at first glance I thought I would hate it.  I ended up laughing out loud!  Interesting concept with lots of interesting twists to keep me engaged!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I read this book because it is on New York Times bestseller list and had good reviews on amazon.com. I did like it. The format chosen by the author of writing a chapter each in first person by the leading man and the woman characters made interesting reading.The story line was good and held my interest till the end. In fact it is written as a thriller and it is intense and gripping. Hard to put it down. However, there were some parts and events which looked unlikely and for the same reason, I did not like the ending.It ended like in a movie. Still I will recommend it to any one who is looking for a good ,interesting book of fiction.<br /><br />Shyam Suri, India
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Should be included in with the Kindle, it is so dumb to have to buy every single piece separately. Make it a complete package for goodness sake.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|This continuation of the Saxon Chronicles is a great fectional account of the life and times of Alferd the Great as seen through a reluctant supporting warrior.
0307346617|4.0|Zombie apocalypse as alternate history... This is perhaps the most unusual zombie book I have ever come across.  The book is set AFTER the apocalypse has ended, in a relatively normal post-zombie world, and consists of personal stories of people who survived the war.  What this means is that you know from the outset that humanity survives, and you know from the outset of each personal story that the main character of each story survives.  This removes much of the horror element of the story, leaving in its place what feels more like a future alternate history.<br /><br />The stories are touching, the characters memorable and the overall theme has a breadth and pacing that (again) feel more like a work of history than horror fiction.<br /><br />I liked it.
B004CMBZJC|3.0|A co-worker recommended this series to me. So, I was intrigued to see what it was all about. It started off pretty cool... aliens, technology, and how events change people. But after the fourth episode, it just got plain weird. It may not be for me, but someone else might take a different perspective.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|These songs show true hard work from The Strokes, a major improvement from Angles! I think Julian Casablancas really redeemed himself and shows he is still the same singer from Room on Fire and Is This It. Overall, amazing songs, great beats, and I wouldn't mind listening for the rest of time!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|i love knowing instantly, exactly how much power i have on my KINDLE FIRE HD. And when to start charging when it shows it's getting low.<br /><br />i rely on this EVERY DAY and find it invaluable.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!!<br /><br />p.s. also, it's so much easier to see than that teenie, tiny battery at the top right hand corner. imho, that's pretty much useless..
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is a great time consumer. You only get 5 hearts to start but the reload pretty quick. you can build up coins to get special jewels and they help a lot. fun for all ages.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A review is not even needed for this movie.  It was masterfully done and is a great movie to watch.  It's a must buy.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love it.  Didn't know what I was missing all this time without it. Now I don't have to pull out my labtop every time I need a qick search.
0062082353|2.0|poorly written, was unable to finish, would not reccommend can't write anymore about it!!<br />Mary had a little lamb etc
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Cannot wait until the bluray. Season has some classic episodes. New uniforms. The Borg. Q. They don't make em like they used to.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|This app works great playing YouTube videos. The problem I have, If I have to stop the video to do something else and my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; goes to sleep. Tube Mate will freeze up. I can close the app and reopen it but that will not fix the problem 100% of the time. I have to reboot my KIndle HD to get TubeMate to work again.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Ive always been waiting for this movie to come out, and I finally got it my hands. I love how the second cd gives u a look at how they made and u get to see what the actors had to say, which I thought was awesome!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Would i always believe in my c.hildren?  Or would I delude myself into believing what I Wanted to believe in my heart. Could i have raised a damaged child with so much love but my imperfect self?  Good book.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Love the series, well written, a should read. read from the first of the series to get to know the charectors...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the most engaging books I've read. I'll be shocked if this will not be made into a movie also...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion Bible app has kept my wife and I on a schedule for whatever part we wish to study. We are into our 327th day of reading the Old Testament. We set it to read aloud to us and we follow along by reading it. We completed the New Testament last year and have done other studies at Christmas and Easter. Without this type app I have never been able to maintain this level of study and reading. It is part of our dailey lives and gives us some quiet time together.
0385349947|5.0|Loved this book and the message. Some of taken it out of context and have taken offense since she is a wealthy woman; try applying what you can to your life, minus the nanny....it is applicable to all working women.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|The game is nothing new, a matching version of Bejeweled Blitz or dozens of other match/connect 3 games.  However, it implements an 'energy/life' mechanic which limits you to playing 5 rounds at a time, before having to wait for a life to regenerate (8 mins per life).  Of course, you're able to buy your way past that with real money purchases, or spamming your FB wall.  It has a mildly interesting level up mechanic, but not interesting enough to offset the money-grubbing nature of the design.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My granddaughter loves playing this game everytime she comes to visit me and she can't wait to play other games like this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have come to find that sequels in books or movies are never as good as the first in the series. I however could not have been more wrong. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting to continue reading.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works just as well as my Kindle Fire. Linked up to my Amazon acct easily. Read on the go. I love it.
B0016CTX68|5.0|I bought this by accident...digital purchases being so absolute, could not return.  But it was a good mistake because it had many tracks not included in the Hot Rocks album which I also purchased.  I may find away to give this away to a friend...but still is one of the best albums the Stones ever produced.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|There are sometimes problems with logging into Facebook. And you must be quick to maintain a combo, but this game is a lot of fun!
B0016CVN02|5.0|How can you give the Stones a bad review?  Everything they have ever put out was number one.  This album puts all their number ones in one place.  Wonderful.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Work just what was expected! Excellent. I love having this since i don't use my laptop nor desktop anymore when i got iPad :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is the only downloader program that has allowed me to download certain YouTube videos for future review.  Thank you.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The package got here on time. Plus it was in great conditon. Brand new and at a great price. Better than ebay.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|If Pandemonium was a great album i can't describe how much better motherland is. Truly back to the power of Pretty Maids A days in the late 80's. i got the album to support a band that i always liked. I can't stop listening to. Mother of all lies, wasted, infinity etc etc. get this album its just Pretty Maids at their best.<br />Gosh i never get tired of Ronnie Atkins voice.,
B006MQRLSA|4.0|The author of the book does a great job and the film does it justice.  I recommend it especially for baseball fans.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Husband says:<br />A mature twist on some great Sting songs.<br />Wife loves it.  Hey, no more needs to be said.<br />oops  ; )  or did I<br />Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the book. The author's own after-death-experience mixed with his scientific background deliver a different approach to the abundant literature written on this field.<br /><br />Of course the book delivers more questions than answers, but opens a door (in a very simple language)to the connection between our material life and \\"heaven\\", being the study of consciousness the key to start finding answers.<br /><br />This is not, on the other hand, a book that confirm all the fundamentals of one or another religion, but connects some elements found in many of them (at least that was what I learned from the author's message)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is truly the most wonderful, inspirational book that I have ever read. I absolutely love it. I will read it over and over again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well written. Death is the narrator but he is a worn out tired soul. All the main characters are likable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I haven't seen a lot games like this before I think this is a great game for a person. I love the the way they start you off in the way you would have to maintain the game. It a great game for adult or a child.
B003UESJEM|4.0|As an employee of a large worldwide corporation, I was definitely moved by \\"Company Men\\". This was sort of a horror movie for me, as it details the lives of various men after a massive downsizing at their company (a Boston ship builder). The emotions of each character dealing with issues such as their financial situation, their reduced ego, and their relationship with family is tough to watch. It really hit home as there are people in today's economy dealing with these exact situations every day. When your life is heavily tied up in your work, it is very painful to have that taken away from you, and \\"Company Men\\" does a great job of illustrating that.<br /><br />The movie has a solid cast including Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones, Chris Cooper, Kevin Costner, and Mario Bello. It is directed by John Wells, who was one of the creators of \\"ER\\".  Affleck is the main character in the movie, and he is a 37 yr old high-climber with a huge home and a Porsche. Costner plays his brother-in-law, who comes to his aid after his layoff. Jones plays a higher level executive whose partner is the HR Manager (Bello). And Cooper plays an older employee who has a tough time getting back in the job market.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching serious family or workplace dramas, definitely check out \\"Company Men\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nice book!!Big cliff hanger at the end. I recommend \\" Catching fire\\" to anyone 12 and up.<br />I love the book series!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Its so fun and easy to play!!! My  year 4 old nephew is awesome at this game! Thank you for your time you took to read this!!! PEACE OUT!!!

B008602KQI|4.0|My daughter recommend that I watch this movie. Finally, we both view it together. Must say, I enjoyed watching every minute. I think you will to.
0385535147|4.0|Grisham's Racketeer is another success story by a con artist who himself has been a victim of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act(RICO.) The story has speed and smartness by which the loser takes on big conspiracy with the underdog getting the win in the end. The project is unrealistic enough and Grisham lets Bannister confess the odds of a successful outcome has been at least a thousand to one throughout the time of conceiving.<br /><br />I couldn't fully approve his conduct, even if his act had been a product of Grisham's feisty critiques against the legal system. From Japanese feelings, his plot was nothing more than raking off from his cell mate. Swindled Nathan Cooley deserves my sympathy. To evade criticism Grisham makes Westlake say to Bannister \\" You're just getting revenge, one last shot at the government\\" in the book. And Bannister demands digging up hidden parts of a victim Fawcett.<br /><br />Rather I was fascinated by Vanessa's self-sacrificing, nimble action throughout the book. Bannister told his infatuation with Vanessa was not exactly a two-way street and he wrote her letters several times. I take much more interest in why and how she made up her mind to support his conspiracy.
B00125JP1C|1.0|What a mindless waste of talent. I can't imagine what the three stars were thinking when they signed their contracts. I turned it off after 15 minutes. If I knew how, I would have added 0 stars to my review.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|When I got this app for my kindle fire it was acting glitchy. So I tried to get out , but couldn't because it froze my device. WORST APP EVER!!!!!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This games is so cool and the warrior is so awesome because when you level up  and  you can upgrade  your weapons .
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|in my personal opinion, it is a great and well orchestrated game. easy control, fun gameplay and overall it is just a great game. go ahead and buy it... but... considering the fact that it updates 2 weeks after every other IOS device, its not any fun to discover what the new towers do when your freinds have already ruined the surprise.
B00BHMF578|4.0|You can't really go very wrong when a movie is based on a true story. Good watch. I would have loved it if the pace was a little faster. The actors have done a good job.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is delightful film will capture you from start to finish with its indelible humor, wit and courage. I was only sorry to not have seen it sooner
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy playing Mahjong Deluxe HD Free. It is an exciting game and it is very challenging. I just can't seem to stop playing it.<br />I have to make myself stop playing just so I can get some work done around the house or go to work.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great.  hasn't failed me yet.  I just use basic alarm but occasionally music wad it works great. solid alarm clock app.

B0042EJD8A|1.0|This movie is nothing more than Propaganda and has been discredited.    This movie has already been proven to have false claims. Do you research and read the FACTS about Fracking. Hydraulic Fracturing done by today's standard regulations has never contaminated drinking water. That is a scientific truth. What HAS happened is accidental spills at the surface have gotten into the ground, no different than any other oil or natural gas accident has. Fracturing adds no new danger to the environment. I will post some links to back this up.    EPA Exonerates Fracking in Pennslyvania  [...]    Read #4  [...]    What about the movie \\"Promise Land\\"  [...]      MIT study finds no new threats by adding fracking to process:  [...]      University of Texas, Austin finds no evidence of groundwater contamination when correctly done, but does find surface spills have confused the issue:  [...]      USGS clears fracking in AK case:  [...]      British study clears fracking of any additional environmental concerns to normal energy harvesting process:  [...]

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Yikes! Once I started reading, I could not put this down.  I was captivated by the explosive heat between the two main characters, and stunned by the ending. Loved it. Good god, give me a love like that any day! If you're looking to lose yourself in fantasy, this is the book for you.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is probably the best one I've ever gotten. It's so addicting and I've got other people playing too. (: absolutely love it.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|I used to love all the Law and Order shows. As world events became even more distressing and violence seemed to increase here in the states, my patience with tough method police shows featuring violent acts waned. I enjoy intriguing, thoughtful shows and movies. The Good Wife, though it follows the same structure each week, weaves just enough office, courtroom, home life with the children and dealings with the husband's woes to keep me interested, entertained and relaxed. I don't need added stress in my life. The cases Alicia is assigned vary and her relationships with husband, firm colleagues, her mother-in-law and children are believable. I just wish I could stay as calm, reflective and guarded as she does in her daily dealings and I hope she discovers what her kids have been up to very soon. I'm delighted to have found The Good Wife and when I'm done with all the episodes, I suspect that I'll be a bit disappointed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just what I expected and arrived when expected. It is a gift for someone who missed most episodes as they were aired
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book is a classic Nicholas Sparks romance book. Just enough plot to make it not overly cheesy, but nothing overly complicated either. I didn't care for the way Sparks wrote the voice of Kevin, but other than that it was well written and entertaining.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Good movie and I think Hopkins made a very good Hitchcock.  Especially liked the Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins portrayals.  Not a blockbuster but very entertaining movie about the master of suspense.  Worth watching a second time.
B000002VSN|5.0|I literally can listen to this CD day in and day out.  Whitney Houston at her best, what a shame she wasted this gift from God :(
0061906220|5.0|We heard this book read at library time. It has been a favorite since then. The hook of the book is the song. It's simple and fun for a 2 1/2 year old.  The moral of the story is that no matter what life throws you, it's all good. Great lesson for us all.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The impact of this novel is described by the Wall Street Journal as second only to Harry Potter, financially speaking. I imagine both we're designed to accomplish just that. I contributed my part,to James at least, but lost interest half way thru. Exciting when it was new, but got boring long term.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Certainly one of the best films of 2012 about the Lincoln Administration's efforts at the end of the American Civil War to pass the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to outlaw slavery. Even _that_ proved to be a difficult vote buying / coalition building project. So why should we be surprised that the political process today often remains painfully slow ... Also, Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Abraham Lincoln was mesmerizing.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is SOOOO much better than sitting through the painful TV version with the commercial breaks every few seconds. Of course, you can tell where the edits insert the commercials -- but still better than being blasted with shampoo, car, and lipstick messages. The ladies are strong and fabulous. The storylines are intriguing, the costumes are phenomenal, etc.
B008220D5K|3.0|Definitely one of those \\"more serious\\" family/relational comedies that one needs to be warned about before coming to see it thinking it's just going to be a bunch of laughs. Though most characters are white and the family is basically upper middle class their conflicts do seem to be rather universal for the U.S.A. today.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|This second version of the movie does not disappoint. The guys are as great as ever. Definitely recommend. I only hope the third movie is as good.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Fans of the musical who've seen various stage productions of the musical will probably be disappointed by some of the singing.  However, this film version of the culturally significant and beloved musical will certainly make the musical far more accessible to the general populace than previous high priced stage productions.  (And the story's largely about the struggles of poor / suffering people after all ... ;-)
B00A757EFW|2.0|Game takes a while to get used to playing by touch as do most older remakes. Nostalgia is a plus though.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Walk into the world of the infomus Vikings, as they discover new lands, loyalties, and things to take. A very addicting series a must watch!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a somewhat haunting (not 'spooky' kind of 'haunting') that pulls at the depths of your heart. I have read more than one account of the horrors of Irish 'orphanages' run by the Catholic Church, and each time I simply cannot conceive of such cold and brutal treatment of children. I am both sickened and saddened that any country would look the other way, and am so relieved that they were finally closed down in the 60's. The story was sort of 'duel' and then came together at the end. I wish the author had spent as much time developing the end of the book as she did the beginning. For me it was somewhat like meandering down a whitewater river, then suddenly, you went over the falls, and it was over. But, I still enjoyed it.
B002RI98BA|4.0|Thoroughly recommend. A book that made me reflect on the the lack of ethics in today's political establishment. If you like political history you will like this book.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Perhaps the worst hip hip cd of the year.<br /><br />Seems that Yezzy had an obligation to produce an album, but did not want to.<br /><br />This artist should retire for a few and come back with something more than 2 star album
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very similar to a basic calculator that I have used for years.  Easy operation. We would recommend it for use by anyone (young to old).
B0007MWZEK|5.0|chose this rating as this product is great.  One is for the litter trail the cats leave constantly.  The other is for the kitchen for rugs and over the tile on floor.  Price of a lunch out or dinner and they last almost a year.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|. If I would have known it was Panavision I would not have rented it.  I expected full screen.  It should have said it was in Panavision.  I will not be buying any more rented movies until I know that it is not Panavision. A narrow strip picture on my big screen TV is most annoying.
B007SPPANM|1.0|The dvd won't play on any player I've tried it in. can't see any scratch or flaw. simply does not work.
B004HD61KE|5.0|The story was incredibly heartfelt...Rollins really put his characters through the ringer which made it that much closer to real life...you know if we all were super spies ;)
B00594XOZU|4.0|It's okay for the most part but at some point the app will crash so I will have to download it again and there kinda annoying and I don't know what to do
159562015X|1.0|Just to clarify initially - Amazon's customer service was excellent as usual. My ongoing problem with this book is through the companies website.<br /><br />So, in the back of this book is an access code to take an online assessment that can only be used once. There is a foil sticker covering the access code that rips the paper to shreds when you try to peel it off. I hate to be paranoid, but this design flaw is so stupid and obvious that it seems like it somehow has to be on purpose.<br /><br />After ripping the paper in the book trying to take of the sticker, I emailed the customer service dep. with the ISBN # and title of the book explaining that I needed them to tell me the access code so I could do the assessment. Long story short, there has been a number of back and for emails over a period of weeks and they still have not given me the access code. They have repeated snet me emails saying they can't assist me without this or that piece of information - each time this has happened the information they needed was in the original email they were replying to. The incompetence in customer service mixed with the stupid design of the sticker in the first place is appalling.<br /><br />I was supposed to do this assessment for a class and now I am late on the assignment because I REFUSE to buy another book from these idiots. Unfortunately, I could not just return the book because it is required for school. Hopefully I will EVENTUALLY get the access code that I freaking paid for.
B00710Z87M|5.0|This book is a wonderful tool to help you take the steps necessary to move forward in creating lasting change in your relationship with money.<br />Organized well and easy to use with exercises to help anchor new associations. I use it with my coaching clients and it's been very effective.<br />Definitely a must have on your bookshelf!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I bought this for my fourteen year old daughter who loved the book, and I think she likes it even more than the novel it is based upon.  The acting is excellent, Emma Watson is great as the actor who plays Charlie the lead character. It is Patrick though who really steals the show.  It is sad though, dealing with issues like suicide and even molestation.  Drug use while not glorified is depicted in a realistic fashion, kids do drugs, if those things make you uncomfortable this movie may not be for you.
0062238868|5.0|Great book about a truely humble American Hero! Easy and fascinating read and full of war information that the media apparently didn't think was news worthy!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Truly amazing. I really love that the dragons are so adorable. You really have to handle tor money well, or else you will lose it quite fast. Its like no other game.
B002SJ8FH6|4.0|A hilarious play based on the movie --- rather than the novel on which the movie itself was based --- is currently making the rounds. In the past year, I've seen it at 2 universities and one community theatre. The play tracks the movie almost scene by scene, though the movie itself is more serious in tone. Audio quality is the problem with the movie in downloaded, VHS, and DVD formats, though it's not as bad as some of the other Hitchcock movies from the 1930s. It's a shame that such a masterpiece has begun to slip away from us.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|This album is a lot of fun to listen to. The songs are catchy and upbeat. Bruno Mars has a good voice and he picked songs that really bring that out.  I think I'll be listening to this album for awhile. I bought this as a bargain MP3 purchase but I will buy the CD.<br />That seems to be my new barometer these days. Keep the good music commin amazon.<br /><br />Peace<br />Musicman
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and recommended it for several friends.  Even bought another one for a gift. (Mine's on my Kindle)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a good series - well crafted and well paced after the first 30 pages or so. Some parts were predictable, but there was a lot of originality tithe series.
1591840562|5.0|Guy you are an awesome writer. I thank you for such an awesome book. I love the way you write. I love the information you offer us for such a low price. The information in this book is so valuable and important for any startup to know and implement.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Purchased for my husband for his birthday.<br />Also came with cd download to my ipad,  like a 2 in 1!<br />Transaction was quick and easy.<br />Download for my ipad happened within 5 minutes<br />Delivery for actual CD was fairly prompt.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I am a fan and feel grateful that Justin Hayward still has it in him to make an album of great songs at age 66 (67?). Of course they sound like the Moodies but that is a plus. Nice melodies and thoughtful lyrics and the album has a sonic sheen to it. I don't understand why he added those disco techy versions at the end of his CD, though. They totally distract from the experience. They just don't fit. I would like to have been in the room when his promo guys urged him to put these dub dance tracks on his CD as well.  But the first 11 songs are classic Justin Hayward. I would buy this again.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift and it is very fun.  Can be adapted to work for a lot of different ages.  Fun family game that can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|Love Christopher Plummer as a klingon, well worth watching your favorite characters in this great part of the franchise. May not be the best Star Trek movie ever, but at least as good as the two parter, Wrath of Khan - Search for Spock.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Everybody should read this book just for its insight about how to start a religion. Bokononism is the perfect religion for beginners and it is probably better than yours. It embodies total honesty that is to be found in no other religion. The &#34;Books of Bokonon&#34; begin with this sentence. &#34;All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.&#34;<br />  You can pick this book up and read it faster than &#34;Old Man and the Sea.&#34; But you won't read it just once... Cradle unfolds with more meaning each time through it.<br /><br /> &#34;Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.&#34;<br /><br />What's wrong with this work? It is addictive. Every time I read it I think &#34;I could have read something new!&#34; Then I'm glad I didn't.
B000I3UMLQ|1.0|Adds nothing to the overall plot of the franchise, does nothing to advance characters. Just pretend this one didn't happen. SAVE YOURSELVES!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book makes the reader stop, think, and be grateful to be living in the United States. The hardships that women in countries like these endure are unbelievable in the 21st century and those of us that take so much for granted must be made aware of their plight.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, really good, love the interface, will recommend to anyone, useful for any type of calculation. HATS off to the developers!
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|I wandered through Amazon Customer reviews of most of the operas in this set.  A few were mediocre, but most got 4 or 5 stars.  If you're going to trust Amazon reviews, this is a pretty good set.  The sound quality sounds fine to me (thought there are a few older recordings). If you want libretti, you won't get them, but Opera Stanford has all of the Italian ones, and you can find translations elsewhere on the web.  Verdi's output was huge and of amazingly high quality throughout his career .  I find this set to be a joy.
B0000714BP|4.0|Who would have ever expected this. Hadn't seen it for years and it was just as I expected-a great movie, and a good bunch of actors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to use and wonderful. It was easy to navigate during bible study and it reads out loud to you.

0765325950|5.0|Good ending...humanity survives the apocalypse to rebuild society.  All characters were followed and their destiny filled out and completed rationally according to their choices in life.
B004G6009U|5.0|I loved this movie ,and it had great quality. I am glad I can buy a used product from honest sellers.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I don't have 14 more words to write about this CD. It is rediculous to have to say certain number of words to get out of this!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Can't be Victoria's top model. Mmmmm. The story line was great. Great action. Plus always love new autobots. Five star all the way and still hope he can pull another one off.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|It is great! I don't have 14 more words to write about this CD. It is rediculous to have to say certain number of words to get out of this!
B008Y73940|3.0|It's was an ok movie. The reason I watched it I was downtown and people were handing out keychains and shirts and it didn't hit me til I found out it was a movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Man this show kicks ass! Anybody who watches will get addicted and you won't want to turn it off I think it's the best zombie show out
B006GWO5NE|5.0|When I had problems with power cord that came with my Kindle Fire, it was replaced for free with this cable. No questions asked. Quickly charges Kindle. Very happy!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Good story, keeps moving, a little different for a fantasy genre.  Some things that move in a new direction are good
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I'm not a movie critic by any means but this was a very enjoyable movie to watch. The acting was amazing, the special effects were great and the overall story was very entertaining.<br /><br />I can definitely see myself watching this one again and will be recommending it to my family and friends as well.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|This book was action packed and full of funny and romantic moments. The reason I only gave it four stars was because of the cliff hanger.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I don't know who did the research for this movie, but they had their head up their ass.<br />outlaws, ex-cons? drifters? safest place on earth? trees? on the north slope? none of this could be further from the truth. What the hell kind of drugs were the writers on when they wrote this piece of drivel?<br /> I'm sad to see Liam Neeson lower himself to be part of this obviously leftist, terrible film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like it cause i was use of playing it so on the going to our way to inner -sestion my kinda friend shania cole she let me play it so i said is there more games i can play in and also my other friend nyra bell se said can she play on the kindle fire and my kinda friend shania cole sad yes
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I deleted it. Didn't work on my Kindle Fire. Nothing more that I can say about this app. Might try it again in the future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is a great way to learn how fun it is to raise a horse being a horse owner I think it's great
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I really enjoyed the simplicity of this book. It gets to the basic truth in life. It's all up to us and our own choices.<br /><br />I will certainly read more of this authors books and have already ordered his latest with a view to purchasing some of his other books.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Finally, someone has done a reasonably good job of creating a historically based series focused on the Vikings with characters and some of the events are actually real (no more of the stupid horned helmets!)Besides the bloodshed, they series explores, quite well, the cultural world the Vikings lived in as it collided with the Christian world. The characters are believable and well acted. The History Channel should continue developing historically based shows. It makes this world accessible in a realistic way.
B0093X805W|5.0|This book is so funny. You have to read it. At the end if the book you maybe shocked!!! So please read this book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Better than X Files. Each episode reveals a little more about the characters. I recommend this to any sci fi person.
B007XF4J70|5.0|A fitting tribute and platform to showcase this timeless classic.  The picture and sound are terrific; the sound quality is excellent!  It truly is the ultimate platform for this classic.
B004259BMM|5.0|I really am enjoying this Get Closer by Keith Urban CD.  I listen to it when I'm in the car instead of the radio.  Thank you!
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|All of the funny parts were shown in the previews.<br /><br />I could not stand the foul language or how disrespectfully the children spoke to their parents.<br />The portrayal of the parents was also strange to me.<br /><br />I will agree with the review I read..........Save your money and watch a different movie.
B0054N73EY|4.0|as a long time chili peppers fan, i have felt that their music is waning, notwithstanding, this cd does grow on you with time
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I must say that while I had enjoyed some of Sanderson's book in the past, I had never counted him amongst the greats. Even the excellent work he did in completing the Wheel of Time series didn't elevate him in my mind although in retrospect, it should have. This one book leaves me with no doubt whatsoever that Sanderson is indisputably one of the greats in this field. I am glad that he has planned ten books for this new series as I look forward to spending an inordinate amount of time in this world of his. Now he just needs to speed up the writing and hopefully, complete it before anything untoward happens. A worthy piece of writing.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It works great on my kindle fire and it is easy to function.I love it and have got almost 300 songs off of it. 10 out of 10
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a really good movie and I loved it. I was drawn into it from the very beginning and loved the message I got from it. I will definitely be adding it to my movie collection. Absolutely loved the relationship that Pi is forced to have with Richard Parker.  This in my opinion is a great family movie for the young and old.
B001I45UFC|4.0|This story was about four children Peter,Susan,Edmund and lucy.They had to leave their counrty because of air-raids.<br /><br />  This new home was quit grand but they didbt find anything inturesting untill they found then self playing hide and seek Lucy (The mysterouis little girl that she is) whent into a wardrobe and found her self out in the snow.(When theres not many wardrobes with snow in them) she goes back out and shows her siblings at first they didnt believe her,then they really did find out it was true.Narnia had been waiting for them for so long they where or as Narnia called them kings and queens. It may sound greatful and happy intill they bump into someone not so sweet,the witch we cant forget about her.<br /><br /> She cntrolled Narnia well for now and even had some trees and animals on her side,she was very powerful abd cruel but she could never beat the mighty lion.You might ask tho why hasnt he killed her yet?well the lion also needed help with the king,queen,prince and princess this isbt your ordinary book of fairy tales buut I guess you could consider that I never said it is but you have to see for your self<br /><br />Do it for Narnia &#60;(*_*&#60;)
B0034G4OYA|5.0|A cute movie for the whole family (watched with a 7 and 4 year old). Worth the money! Love that we have the Digital copy :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the first one and the second is even better! Couldn't put it down once I started. Can't wait for the movie!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I found it difficult to put this book down once I started to read it. Most NDE books I have read in the past had a small portion of the book about the experience itself and surrounded with before and after events that took away from the experience one wanted to know about. Anita's journey is throughout the book which made it a delight to read. Brought much comfort to me as I'm sure it will you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was enjoyable throughout.  It's a story that grandparents and children alike can enjoy and share.  Thrilling and unexpected.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I was student in Paris when I first saw this musical many many years ago. Then after that I enjoyed watching this play over and over again by American or British productions.<br />I was curios to see how this movie production will enhance my experience about this great musical. I didn't know what to expect, but my expectations were very high any way.<br />I have to say that I was very disappointed when I heard the main characters singing. I couldn't help myself but to compare with the voices that I was used to. After leaving the theater my cousin asked why I didn't like it. Because I was driving him to his place, I just told him listen this (by chance I had the CD) where Colm Wilkinson (Valjean)sings \\"Bring Him Home\\". After listening that song, he totally understood why I didn't like it. Don't get me wrong, they are great actors, but as singers they have a long way to go.
B0026P3G12|4.0|It is great.  She is great. But I do not listen to my CD's anymore.  Different life, different life time.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Like this game alot great graphics. Holds your attention not easy to beat,like you can earn better sharks would recommend highly.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm happy to say that this is one of the better John Grisham novels he has written in several years. A definite must read for anyways that has strayed over the years.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|same like 1st book  i could not put it down, at home, at the office, Dr. office, my kids were sick of watching me all into it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting!! It was way better than what I thought...I love the characters and the storyline!
B004AOM5U0|5.0|I have two of my boys in kick boxing so this movie is one of their favorite movies they never get tired of it.
B00A44111O|5.0|I love the movie Jurassic Park, so naturally I would have to get the soundtrack. The music is wonderful, and I feel as though I'm watching the movie when I listen to it. The score was beautifully composed and performed. Anyone who is a Jurassic Park fan I'd say this is something for you. And to anyone else who enjoys music without lyrics.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book kept me going, all the details, wow , all the passion, I couldnt put it down! I even took it to work with me and cheated every chance I got!
B00867GHS8|5.0|The first thing I noticed about the box was how detailed the 3-D cover case was. The movie was good (I saw it when it first came out and again for its re-release).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fell in love with christian myself! I just wished my husband was more like him, the books gave us inspiration.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I like the way it stands up but It's a little heavy.<br />It does a good job. I would like it in different colors.
1400034779|4.0|The book is fun to read and it provides some inside understanding to life in Africa, background and its people.
0525478817|2.0|This book was ok. It's about kids who have cancer and that's sad but the writing and the overall story were not so good
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like the tap feature and the graphics. Tapping speeds up the game and the alert to auto finish a won game is also a welcome feature.
1423113462|5.0|All of the books that I've read by this author have been really good. The lighting thief is another great series. I've only read the first book in this series but I wouldn't expect anythign less than 5 stars for each of the books wrote by this author.
B00068TJM6|5.0|The watch meets my expectations for daily use. Seiko makes and sells excellent and durable watches at a reasonable prices.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord worked perfectly for about two weeks, until my first-generation Kindle finally bit the dust a few days ago.  I know I'll be able to use it with whatever Kindle device I may decide to buy, so I'm a happy camper.
0446530573|5.0|Always good when you have Italians offering recipes for the favorite meals.  Whatever you likes, pasta, fish, steak, soups you'll find meals you will want to prepare for family and friends.
0738711500|3.0|I chose the 3-star rating because, while I didn't expect perfection, this deck looked better onscreen than when I received it.  The quality of the cards is fine, but the artwork really is pretty cheesy-looking.  Perfectly serviceable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books that I have read!  But then, I love all of the books Nicholas Sparks has written.  And they make such wonderful movies!  Looking forward to seeing Safe Haven, The Movie!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a fantastic series. The books are great and the movies really do a great job. Cant wait for the rest.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel, I wonder what dogs DO think and do all day waiting for us to come home, Enzo was such a good dog and deep thinker, I believe my dogs, too, have so many thoughts to express. I can understand their language at times for simple things as a scratch, I need water, or please get Louie off my couch I don't want a fight, I just want to sleep. Enzo was extraordinary and we can only hope dogs who are worth get the 'thumb' when they've reached the highest dog plateau of life. But then, many humans must be on their way back to not having any as they have wasted their lives in destroying others. Recommend this read to all, especially dog lovers world wide.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Maggie Smith is great in this,  as usual.  The entire cast is good.  The writing is good.  The show is just good.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show should not have been cancelled. There is so much reality tv on now that this series was a credit to that junk.
B000002H97|5.0|the shippment got to me in the time they said it would take and I was happy with the product.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|This is a movie my granddaughter hadn't seen yet, so we sat down on the couch and cuddled up to this one day. She loved it.
B000002H6C|5.0|the shippment got to me in the time they said it would take and I was happy with the product.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Everyone needs to see this movie.  The food systems that are in place today are a marketing myth of false choices.  Even when you think that you are buying healthy, companies are cutting corners to trick you into eating unhealthy things.  Not to mention Monsanto.  Please watch this and share it.
B000002H2H|5.0|the shippment got to me in the time they said it would take and I was happy with the product.
0143038583|5.0|A must read for learning about the food systems here in the US.  This is a must read and share.
1881273156|5.0|This book as all book is a perspective on characteristics and personalities overlooked by most people, who are just living their everyday lives, unaware of the singles they give off. Greatly enjoyed.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I love psychology and the things that my mind is doing that I don't even understand.  Reading this book is unlocking a world of love for my brain, and hopefully an inoculation for marketing.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|I love this movie, i've watched it since i was a little kid. It's one of the funniest movies from my childhood. This is a must have for fans of Wayne's World and Beavis & Butt-Head.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|These novels are an easy read. The descriptive writing allows you to lose yourself for a while in the steamy, almost airless (however not soulless) south.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Fun and addictive game! Would recommend for kids or adults. Reminds me a lot of angry birds. try it out!
0525953728|3.0|Some of the material appears to be fictional, but what do you expect from a writer who was in the middle of the action in the dark of night.  Not all memory recollections are going to be factual.  Should be semi-labeled as fictional.
B00005JLWN|4.0|It is violent so if you have an issue with that you will not appreciate Christian Bale at his best.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Favorite book as a child....Used this book for years teaching, both read aloud and assigned chapters.  Fabulous for character studies and development.  Never grows old and great for both girls and boys, though mostly read by girls on their own.  And that's a shame!  Still too many stereotypes amongst boys and their parents.  All should read this.
1936891026|5.0|I know I'm coming in slow freight on this one. It's been out for a bit, and you would think that the time it took me to read it, that the book is heady and academic. Well, the truth is, I wanted to savor every short little chapter. I would pick it up, read a little section, put it down and leave it be for a bit. I suppose I might have been testing my own resistance or maybe my resolve. Either way, the book was WELL worth my time, and I loved taking it in.<br /><br />The War of Art is a collection of short chapters talking about overcoming resistance in order to create. Steven Pressfield [who also wrote The Legend of Bagger Vance and a whole host of other things as well] masterfully draws upon personal experience to help others through the process of creation. He writes from the viewpoint of a writer, because that is his own craft, but his insights and explorations truly filter into any work where one might allow fear to keep the work from coming alive. He differentiates between Amateur and Professional and in one section says, \\"Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. `I write only when inspiration strikes,' he replied. `Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp.'\\" This thought has stuck with me from the book. We can't wait for inspiration. We have to put in the hard work involved in creating and in time, we'll produce something worth showing. We have to faithfully sit down to do it.<br /><br />The majority of Pressfields' other works are all fiction. He has a few deviations, all focused on doing the hard work. The War of Art is well worth the time you'll spend reading it. I don't know of a way to read the book without being inspired to dive into your work, letting go of the security of being an amateur to pursue the path of a professional.<br /><br />I'll leave you with my favorite quote from the book:<br /><br />\\"Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.\\"<br /><br />Have you read it? What did you learn?
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Storyline and content are fantastic. Love it.<br />Picture quality is hampered by the buffering rate. Its okay again after stopping the movie for a couple of mnutes
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I ordered this one since it was free or really cheap, I don't remember which, but also because the one I bought from Barnes and Noble was really badly formatted and caused problems and annoyances with reading. This version is fine and reads well<br /><br />The story is good, although a bit sluggish on the start but does pick up and move along nicely. I would recommend it to others.
B008ZENVNG|4.0|It definitely got my niece excited... she is a fan for Hunger Games... I bought this for her birthday and she totally loved it...
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I use this for my old Nikon D50 with an 18-200mm lens. I needed someone quick and small to grab and go for those trips to the zoo, park, etc. fits perfectly. I might even be able to squeeze in my Nikon flash if I worked it right. Small pockets are perfect for my credit card, ID, keys and cash so I don't have to carry a separate purse.  It is just right for my needs.
0545265355|4.0|It definitely got my niece excited... she is a fan for Hunger Games... I bought this along with the DVD so she can have the complete set....
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire is easy to use.  I didn't bother to look for any instructions but just started playing.  I would recommend this to any solitaire lover!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it! I would classify it in the group of my favorites puzzles: crosswords, cut the rope, jigesaws, sudokus etc
B008745B32|4.0|Vantage point is everything in reading.  I read Brideshead Revisited in my teens to check it off of a college reading list and it didn't leave much of an impression.  Reading it some 40 years later I found many reflection-worthy ideas and images.  I suppose that teens don't have much of a concept of time and redemption and these seemed to me to be the overarching themes of the book as lost souls flounder and waste their lives.  Mrs. Marchmain was the only character leading a blameless (or at least more worthy) life and she was demonized; a lesson on fairness.  Still, the turn of the phrase and the lush descriptions make this book a candidate for a second look.
B000001GXC|5.0|I bought this CD for a recent party we hosted to show friends our travelogue to Scotland in October. We had visited Fingal's Cave and I wanted to set the scene as our photos of the hexagonal basalt rocks came into view. The ebbing and swelling of the music really gave our friends a feel for the way the aquamarine waters crashed into the cave, creating a booming sound.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this island in the Inner Hebrides was a favorite among poets, painters and composers. The other pieces--the Scottish and Italian symphonies are equally beautiful. I just hope I don't wear out this CD from listening to it so muc1
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like this game, and my kids are interested in it since its an arcade game breifly shown on Wreck it Ralph.  Takes some getting used to using controls on the touch screen as opposed to actually holding a control in your hand, but fun!
B004SIP8W0|5.0|This movie is just one of the stories about that terrible time in history. As a father and husband Roberto gives his little son a chance to survive in an almost impossible situation. He makes a game of it so that his son thinks what is happening is fun. Even to the last minute of his life he makes sure his son is still playing a game and hides him telling him to wait for...well I don't want to give it away. Wonderful movie.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Reminded me of lots of old detective TV-series where despite outwitting the cops and solving the crime time after time, the cops are always against him and ready to believe he's turned bad. Think Mannix, Cannon, Rockford Files, even Magnum P. I., or the like.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|still one of the best angry birds and definitely my favorite!  I like that the updates are free.  I've even gotten my husband hooked on it
B0095P33IW|3.0|Mostly true to the revised origin of Cap and Skull but the final crash and drama surrounding it was off and probably the worst part of the movie. See the YouTube video, \\"How it should have ended: Captain America.\\"
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|If your an angry bird fan then you'll love seasons.  I like all angry birds how do i know cuz I've downloaded all ofen
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Battleship is a movie about huge boats with tons of guns blasting the absolute stuffing out of each other. Some of the boats are from space and as a result look all cool and science-fiction-ey, albeit in a somewhat generic way. The alien invaders' ships have a technological edge on Earth's navy, but both fleets are able to deal fairly significant damage to one another. The result is a lot of epic, loud naval combat which is more than a little reminiscent of Japanese nautical adventure comics. Is it then a coincidence that this movie has a prominent Japanese principal (Tadanobu Asano) and premiered in Japan? Surely not. But that's by no means a bad thing- strong foreign cast members and badass naval combat are far too lacking in modern American cinema.<br /><br />The effects for the sea battles are extremely good, and the alien enemies themselves, though rather as generic as their boats, stand out as a high point- they are neither as wantonly evil and bestial as science fiction invaders tend to be, nor as grossly overpowered. When one of their number is captured, they rescue him(?) in a commando raid, and they depend on stealth, sabotage, and cunning to a degree that is usually reserved for the wily human underdogs in such films. Compared to the forgettable Wing Commander movie, in which the noble and cunning Kilrathi were reduced to snarling beast-men with Wolverine claws, the aliens in Battleship are interesting and exciting. They also serve as a warning against dependance on technology over judgment in wartime: most of their blunders result from an over-reliance on friend-or-foe systems in their helmets that allow human combatants to escape certain doom by standing down. This message about brains over science is also played out among the humans themselves- the navy doesn't really clean house until they abandon their modern but technologically vulnerable ships in favor of a thousand tons of antique, cannon-toting battleship (the name has to come in somewhere, right?).<br /><br />So the battleship part of Battleship is a 4 or 5 star film. But it gets dragged down by its opening 30 minutes. These are not exciting, alien battling, swashbuckling, exploding minutes- they are framing in which we learn how our protagonist Taylor Kitsche is a super irresponsible guy who will rob a convenience store to impress a girl (it works). Kitche's character somehow makes second lieutenant in about a year in spite of angering admiral Liam Neeson and constantly disappointing his brother Alexander Skarsgård, who cannot be bothered to suppress his Swedish accent even when he is playing an all-American military man. This misguided block of exposition is punctuated by irritating editing, poorly selected musical scoring, and an uncanny resemblance to a Red Skelton USO sketch, which I must assume is deliberate, and by extension, a horrible idea. You will have to fight hard to keep watching by the 10 minute mark, and when the aliens finally show up to explode stuff, they sort of feel like the heroes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great effects<br />-Surprisingly plausible interstellar war<br />-Enough sprays of missiles, explosions, and churning engines to please the most jaded anime nerd or dieselpunk aficionado<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Horrible characterization<br />-Awful music choices (the end credits employ CCR's Fortunate Son, which I'm pretty sure is a song about how hard it sucks to be in the military and get ordered around by money men and pencil pushers, and is an odd choice in a film where the heroes fight an unavoidable, self-directed war against a totally clean hostile target)<br />-Odd conclusion (with the alien fleet beaten, EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES EARTH IS SAFE IMMEDIATELY (of course there's a post-credit scene to remind us it totally isn't)<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Better than any film based on a board game has a right to be, Battleship only hits its mark when the shells are flying, and as a result is an entertaining film but not a very good one.
B001LMAK88|5.0|All-star cast, before some of them were a big deal.  John Cleese is an added bonus.  Action keeps moving, and Brian Dennehy is the worst bad guy ever.  If you're thinking, &#34;Kevin Kline, a cowboy?&#34; - just watch it.  Costner is great - again - as a cowboy.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|This is simply an Indian Bollywood film that was popularized to get it into the American market.  The big draw was the computer animated tiger, but it really didn't meld well with the background.  It looks fake.  The story was mediocre.  I was highly disappointed
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Creative approach to an old theme where the astronauts survival depends upon his creative application of biology and physics.  I couldn't put it down.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Our whole entire family enjoyed this movie, Rio. It was absolutely fabulous. We're so glad we rented it. We have considered buying it.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|This is a great Saturday night movie...had some people over to watch in 3d and it was a hit.  There is some ghosting with the 3d but nothing to cry over.  If you can get over the comparison from the original story, you will love this!  Just watch and enjoy!<br />MIFF
0140120416|5.0|I have referred to this book so many times. Very informative and to the point. Very easy to understand and navigate.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|As a professional computer tech who repairs computers daily, this is the set to use. It has all the bits I need and the ability to use the extension for extra torque is extremely useful.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|Just.....plain......fantastic.......like Rod Stewart is these days. So do yourself a<br />favor...... and get this......for pennies! And just enjoy it ......

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like the jurassic park app, the graphics are pretty cool and the game is a little more involved than my other free apps
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Since I'm by far not the first to rave about this book, I'll keep it short.  Excellent book, well written, engaging plot.  Don't be put off by the reviews that talk about the \\"log book\\" format.  Really, it's not written in any unusual way, it's just that most of the chapters are all about one guy and his description of what is going on.  The \\"log\\" format just gives a (rather clever IMHO) way of deviding the chapters and making it reasonable for him to be describing everything that is going on in detail since there isn't really anyone for him to have traditional dialogue with.<br /><br />Really, read this book.  You won't be sorry. I almost didn't because I was worried about the \\"log book\\" format but decided for 99 cents, it's not much to lose....  Now, after reading it, I find that I would really have gladly paid a lot more for something this good.<br /><br />This author ever puts out another book and I'm buying it immediately, just on the power of how good this one was.
B004SIP7QC|5.0|From beginning to end, this romantic life story keeps you entranced.  If poetry existed as a film, this would be it.  It has action, love, adventure.  Defnitely a must for any gals collection of hopeful romantic movies!
B008133MDK|5.0|This is one of our favorite PSB Mystery series.  Wonderful dialogue, smart characters and outstanding acting.  The streaming worked like a charm.  And it was free.  Amazon you are the best!!
B002APU580|5.0|I just loved this movie, it was so sweet and romantic!  It went well along with the book and was just a great story.
B004FUPK3I|4.0|What a beautifully shot movie: lavish colors and great set design. Dario Argento really has an impressive eye for filmmaking. Deep Red, Suspiria and Inferno are all top notch! Yes the plot is secondary, but the real joy is to inmerse yourself in the visual aspect of the film. It has quite a vibe.....
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|If I could right less than 20 words for a review I would just leave it at \\"holy crap.\\" This album is the best of Soilwork's career is top 10 all time for melodic metal. I would put this up against anything Soilwork has ever produced. I think it's even better than Natural Born Chaos. And there might be like 20 albums ever that are better than Natural Born Chaos. It's just awesome and a double album for $8? Seriously, why haven't you bought this album yet?
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|Awesome music and an awesome cast! Got to love Johnny Depp. Buy it today!  It really is a great movie and story.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|This album is awesome. I listened to it in full 10 times in the first three days I owned it. I can't get enough of it. It's hard rock perfection. It is a modern classic that can hold up against anything ever put out by Led Zep, Aerosmith, AC/DC, or anyone else to ever carry the banner of hard rock. The only thing that can top this is when Clutch actually plays the songs live because Clutch are amazing live. If you don't own this album, stop browsing and buy this now because nothing else you could buy would be as good as this and therefore don't bother disappointing yourself with buying anything else. How a band, 10 albums into their career can still create something like this is beyond me. There is just no comparison to Earth Rocker.
B000002VMD|5.0|I bought this for my very young niece to show her what real music was. She loved it and play it often.

B0067TGSOK|5.0|Thankfully, gone are the days where a business book had to be dry and dull to be taken seriously. Chris has assembled a truly eclectic ensemble cast of entrepreneurs to give us inspiration to a better life. LOVE the $100 Startup.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first but the rating looked good so I gave it a shot. I wouldn't call it amazing literature but it was very entertaining, a fun read, and I wanted to keep reading. I'm not into stories that are jam packed with drama and conflicts. This was a nice story that didn't push the stress or frustrating situations- enough for story to be entertaining and light.
B003UESJJC|5.0|visually stunning<br /><br />the human drama in war<br /><br />an exploration of the human condition<br /><br />hearts of darkness is fascinating<br /><br />give it a crack!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really enjoy watching the Walking Dead. It is very dramatic, unpredictable, and I am on the edge of my seat for nearly every episode. My only complaint is that the show is very gory at times.
0199573204|5.0|This is an excellent replacement for the earlier World's Classic's \\"Farquharson/Rutherford\\" edition. The language is a little updated (\\"sluggard\\" is now \\"dilatory\\") but nothing radical: it all reads well.  The notes are more comprehensive, and the bibliography, references, etc., more up to date.<br /><br />It is interesting that the Loeb library, which has been updating all measure of texts, is still using the 1916 edition of the original Greek Meditations.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Outstanding book, with unique insights into how our brains enable us as spirits to deal with this material world where we all appear to be separate.  Only a brain scientist could give such an accurate, detailed description of the stroke experience, and her story of how she recovered over several years, getting past many &#34;plateaus&#34; to continue healing, will be inspirational and highly encouraging to anyone who has had a stroke.<br /><br />She also gives us a unique perspective on our real spiritual nature, and how her outlook and behavior has changed as a result of her experience.  The idea of choosing which personal traits you will continue with, and which you will discard, is revolutionary and totally surprising, but it shows we all can do it without having a stroke.<br /><br />Would recommend this book for anyone, not just stroke sufferers and their caregivers, and also for every psychologist and psychiatrist.  Already lent my printed copy (also have it on Kindle) to my neighbor who is a psychologist.  Her husband is a psychiatrist.  This is truly an uplifting book in many, many ways!<br /><br />Dan McAneny
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Really a great movie glad I bought it price was close to other places and no crazy gas price to get there.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Very good movie, and would recommend it to all!<br /><br />Great subject Matter!  A great night at the movies for everyone!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Whenever there's a \\"new\\" Jimi Hendrix album out, I find myself in celebration mode. People, Hell And Angels made me once more realize how gifted a musician Hendrix was and will always be. I've been since its release listening to all things Hendrix - original albums, The Cry Of Love, War Heroes, bootlegs, even the excellent Crash Landing and its dubious overdubs...<br /><br />The focus on People, Hell And Angels is on stuff Hendrix recorded outside the Experience and quite a lot of it brings out the funk and soul of the incredible Band Of Gypsys. There's simply nothing nowadays that could touch that magical moment in music, period.<br /><br />So, my conclusion is the more Hendrix, the better. I just can't get enough of his playing and voice and whenever there's a chance to listen to something slightly new, I'll cherish it because at the end of the day it's the music he left behind that counts anyway. I'm glad Experience Hendrix has been putting out stuff at lightning speed. Why wouldn't I? It's Hendrix and it's bloody brilliant.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|The world of fantasy described in this book is an interesting one....but it is unsatisfying because so arcane.  There are many many loose ends, and I will certainly read the sequel to see if it has answers.  Maybe I've been burned too often, but I doubt they exist.  And I won't read 10 books looking for them.....
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very addictive. My husband had my 2 youngest children and me download the game so he could expand his land. The dragons are very bright and colorful.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game has come in handy for those appointments where my children need to sit and have something to keep them occupied. We love it and its very handy.
B000S58428|5.0|Amazing artistry. A classic. Musical wizardry at its best. Coldplay never disappoints. My collection is now complete. A must listen!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Shocking, hard to put down and just unbelievable in every war. Highly recommended for reader lovers and those who have read previous ones.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I loved this band's sound the first time I heard Little Talks, and am happy to say their uniqueness flows through the album nicely.  The songs have a folklore feel yet sound modern.  I've been replaying the album over and over ... its my current favorite.
B000BISBDY|4.0|The more I listen to this , the more I appreciate the classic oldies and the fact that I want to listen to the newer ones as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a wonderful series and I loved the book so much.... I can't even explain how great. It was in an so very pleased with Mrs. Collins writing in this series... I hope she continues with another new and greater series (:
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This is a great movie.  Each Tinker movie seems to get better and better.  They even hold my husband's attention!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Talking Tom is better than the other apps. He's been a brilliant idea of a game. This free download has  hilarious cat.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|In trying to see all of the Oscar nominees before the awards show, I rented this on a Friday evening before a Blackhawks hockey game was scheduled. I was late for the beginning of the game. A poignant, real-life look at a real-life problem for a physically disabled man. While the subject matter could have been handled in a more salacious manner, it was tasteful and tempered by the use of humor. It was nice to see more of Ms. Hunt(literally!)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put this series down. It's a page turner the whole way through. You won't regret reading these books!
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Alright people prepare for a troll review. If you don't like what I have to say, move on to the next review, for the rest of you I'll try to make this as funny as I can.<br /><br />Little Wang is without a doubt one of the worst rappers on this planet. With one of the worst voices I have ever heard, Lol Wayne ruins every song he has ever been in. Including his own. I Am Not A Human Being II is just another freaking terrible album from the young money cash money loot money bags of money coin money currency money invest your money (in something else) rapper.<br />Lil Wang started out the promotion of this album with \\"My Homies Still\\". The song features Big Sean and let's be honest, Big Sean is the only reason you should ever listen to this song. The second single from the album was \\"No Worries\\" it features somebody I really just don't care about, and I'd rather write this overly-long sentence than look up who it was. The song is just the same generic bull crap that Lil Touchy has put out in every other album of his. His last single before the album was \\"Love Me\\" Featuring Drake and Future, it was excruciatingly painful to listen to. Future proved again that he is good for absolutely nothing, as his part makes you want to shove a gun in your ear. Drake is the only reason you should ever listen to the song, and even then you'll probably regret it.<br />The album finally dropped and it was actually hilariously bad enough to keep me entertained for the April 2nd release of Wolf by Tyler, The Creator. I listened to a few of the snippets on iTunes and there was only one song that I was like \\"Maybe I was wrong...\\" But nope. I loved the piano part on the song IANAHB but then Mr. Wang started vomiting all over it and I went and cried myself to sleep. As for the rest of the songs on the album, it was painful. Every other song sounded exactly the same, and they were all incredibly painful.<br />Let's be honest. Lol Wang is just awful. The only word he knows is the \\"N\\" word. It'sjust terrible overall and if you even think about purchasing this album for any reason other than comedic purposes then you should probably go look at yourself in the mirror and wonder what you are doing with your life.<br />1/10
B0013HYLT0|5.0|I confess I love this musical.  The melodies are charming, the lyrics delicious.  Sure, Dick Van Dyke makes an awful Cockney, but he dances and smiles well, so who really cares?  Julie Andrews is stunning, David Tomlinson perfect for the role, Glynis Johns and the children are fine.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I now only buy books through Kindle books because the kindle is so easy to carry and read.  This is a one of my favorite products.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|I've always been a Russell Crowe fan, which is why I bought this.  I didn't think I'd like it, but I did.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for Android is a great product.  I use it all the time and have downloaded around 12 books without a hitch.  No force closes.  Amazon makes it so easy to purchase books and be a minute later reading it.  Keep up the good work!
0312370849|5.0|Very good book.  A Holocaust story of challenges, betrayal, friendships, family life and dealing with the facts of life that can't be changed.  I really liked this book a lot.  .
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|The movie was what I expected to be. It was funny, and entertaining. It was a pretty lengthy movie but it kept my attention for the most part. I love Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann together. They should make more movies with each other.
1426308469|5.0|Lots of cool pics, graphics, and interesting info on a a a a a a a a a a dinosaurs.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I'm a Disney lover, and this was a must-have for my collection.  The person who shipped it to me still had it plastic wrapped and still had the cover on it.  Plus, it came very quickly.  Now, I can watch it anytime I want to and my nephew who lives with me loves it, too.
B007PKOKTK|1.0|did not download  - spent 25 minutes trying to get it to load and it went back to beginning - did not resume - horrible experience and my child is sad
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Bon Jovi just keeps on putting out quality music and by the way, had the opportunity to see them on their Because We Can tour and it was incredible!!!!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I haven't started to look at the details of this app yet except to notice that it doesn't seem to know where Allentown PA is. I have selected Allentown as my first location but the marker is always on Pittsburgh PA and I can't move the marker to Allentown. Anyone else having a similar problem and how did you solve it?<br /><br />I have always preferred to use Accu-Weather but this is frustrating.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I found this book very entertaining and a little scary. It really presents the question, \\" who can you trust?\\"
B000EBEHR2|5.0|I lost my CD years ago, and I am so thrilled to have a new copy. There is not a bad track on it. If you like great, meaningful, eclectic music, this is for you!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love any book about Mickey the Lincoln lawyer just wish Michael would write more about Mick-- great book read this and first read The Lincolin Lawyer first
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Total horror story.  Again, good vs evil and the good wins.  A Stephen King must.<br />A must read, should be part of your library.
B009A9SULS|5.0|Just like every other ereader. Only it's a kobo, which means a better user interface. And a mini, which means the most portable ereader. But this is a touch ereader, make sure you want it instead of non-touch version. A touch ereader can make you accidentally switch pages.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|I liked this CD. However I'm not sure I like it as much as his oldies. I hope he'll record more.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|My husband loves this show. He has the series and watches it all the time. He can't get enough. Worth buying
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I;ve enjoyed this app very much and amazon made it easy and simple to download and fast thankyou very much
B007RI56NY|5.0|Well for starters, this has been the only Train album that I have purchased, and I love it.  I really like all the tracks on it, they all seem to have a message of keep trying and learn to love living life.  My favorite is the duet in Bruises.  I also like the whistle tune in Meet my mom, and When the fog rolls in.
B004OZZ624|4.0|I like this movie because it had a good story, well thought out.  I didn't really pick out any illogical portions...  well considering the content.  Had some grip moments and a good ending.  For as long as it was it kept me wanting to finish it.
0007466064|5.0|This book is just as great as the other 3 in the series.  George R.R. Martin is one hell of a writer.  The min-series on t.v. is great!  The mini-series is just as great as the book.  I really didn't know about this book until I went on Amazon, because the last one of his books kept referrencing this book, and I kept looking for in book stores and never found, until I checked on Amazon.  I'm almost finished with this one, and the next one, 2.  After the Feast is next and waiting for me on my coffee table.  I love these books and the t.v. mini-series is wonderful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie.  Wasn't as sad a most of Nicholas Sparks books, which I was glad of.
6305692572|5.0|This movie makes my heart full. I love it.  I ordered 2 day shipping and got it the next day.  At $4.99, for a movie I can hardly find anywhere else ? I was truly happy!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This is a great game but what I noticed is that nothing in the shop (except healing potions) are buyable with coins. Instead it's all glu credits! I have a lot of coins and I've been hoping to get some weapons but there's nothing I can do. (Except buy some glu coins)(but I really don't want to do that)
B003NTSBTC|5.0|Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese has created a faithful adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel, and a well-crafted film unto its own.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|suspenseful thriller loved it, Huge Gosling fan, Hopkins plays a his character so well and so convincing, it is a great flick
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. Get leps world 2 it has way better graphics. It also has power ups. But there is only one bad thing,it keeps interrupting the game
B004OBQDHK|5.0|great flick.  Keanu Reeves is always good, love his character, great movie, love the surfing parts too.  I give it five stars
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|i really like it, but for some reason, there is this really weird glitch and it wont let me level up :(
B000JQU4TW|4.0|A very interesting introspection of the soul. It gives a terrorizing answer to the wish of being forever young, and \\"beautiful\\"
B000I186FW|5.0|Acting was superb. All I can say is I feel like we need about 1 million of those masks about now in the US. This movie and the current situation in the US is too similar to be ignored.<br /><br />Great movie though. I highly recommend it for anyone who has a passion for standing up for what they believe in.
1609611543|5.0|GREAT BOOK, I LEARNT A WHOLE LOT FROM THIS BOOK.  I HAVE BECOME SO MUCH MORE CONCIOUS OF THE AMOUNT OF WHEAT I EAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVENT CUT IT OUT COMPLETELY.  HOWEVER I LOVE TH INFO IT ALLOWS ME TO HAVE.  I CAN MAKE BETTER CHOICES AND KEEP MY WEIGHT DOWN BECAUSE OF IT
B0045HCJRG|4.0|I thought this was a cute movie. Original idea, good story. My only issue is I feel he didnt end up with someone who truly cared for him. I think Eve was mentally messed up and only stayed with him to keep others from getting him. In all seriousness I think Troy actually cared for him more and he probably should have ended up with him. Of course the general public at the time this movie was released would have been outraged at that idea, and im not gay either. I just think Troy cared about him more. Good acting all around though, nice movie.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We enjoyed how the story progressed and were suprised by unexpected plot twists.  Can't wait for Season 4. We purchased Season 1 and 2 and were equally satisfied.  Our only regret was there was no Christmas Special included in Season 3 Blu-ray.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Very entertaining. Kept me interested and wanting to read more. Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very interesting way to tell a story, from both perspectives.  In the middle it started to get predictable, then wham! everything was flipped.  I really enjoyed this book.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Even though i am not a writer, i have found many uses for this app.  Especially since you can email.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy it, although I haven't won yet so far.  ( I know that is poor grammar, but I couldn't think of 12 words.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just read it. It's one of the most riveting and well-written novels that I have ever read. The omnibus edition is a great deal and most of that money goes to the author. What more could you ask for?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|What can I say. I'm not a very frequent user of face book.  I know there is a tutorial, but I can't find it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show!  it's witty and serious and the nback to witty!<br /><br />it it really easy to bring up on our Roku.  Haven't noticed any glitches.
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|This from a die-hard Zepplin fan.  The audio quality just isn't up to par.  I know the boys are aging, and that isn't what the negativity is about, the recording just sounds poor to me.  I am comparing the audio quality to the Song Remains the Same, so it's apples to apples as far as it being Led Zepplin live.<br /><br />When this album came out, I purchased it from Amazon and iTunes so I could have it on all devices without having to worry if something would go awry.  I have since deleted it from iTunes and the cloud player.  The same for my girlfriend who loves Zep as much as I, she actually asked me to turn it off when I was first listening.<br /><br />I can't recommend it. Heck, I can't even listen to it, honestly.<br /><br />That said, would I have spent a fortune to have actually been there?  Yep, it's Led Zepplin! And the only band on my favorites status that I haven't seen live.
B00001QGPR|3.0|Two years after the power frenzy that was \\"Earthling\\", Bowie decided to tone it down, or grow old or mellow out. Or all three. If it is anything it is mature. This album is so laid back that it sounds like it was made by a completely different musician than the one who made \\"Earthling\\". This stark contrast is never more evident than watching the \\"Earthling\\" videos and then seeing `Thursday's Child'.<br /><br />This album is more like what your typical singer-songwriter might do. This is the album Bowie previously said he could never do. It is personal, attached, adult contemporary fare about life winding down and expectations not being met. \\"Black Tie\\" is David's wedding album. This is his divorce album. He gave us \\"Low\\". He should have called this one \\"Loss\\".<br /><br />On the cover, new Bowie holds Earthling Bowie. It is a passing from one style to another. This passing makes this an extremely hard album for me to rate because it is so understated in relation to most of the albums that came before it. If not compared to those it would rate higher. Due to that it is also the album of his which I play the least.<br /><br /> `Thursday's Child' ~ The first song is a portent of what is to come. It shows the calm, easy going, relaxed feel of the album right up front. It will get more stressful emotionally, but not musically. This is the one and only hopeful song on the album. This is the love he is to lose, the lost love whom the whole album seems to be about.<br />\\"Now that I really got a chance<br />Everything's falling into place<br />Seeing my past to let it go<br />Only for you I don't regret\\"<br /><br />`Something In The Air' ~ Now is when he feels something is wrong. And it is too late to do anything about it. The albums first six cuts are slow to mid tempo guitar songs and they reflect his torn inner emotions well. He is being pulled into a realization that he does not want to accept, and the music pulls you along with him.<br />\\"We used what we could<br />To get the things we want<br />But we lost each other on the way<br />I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you\\"<br /><br />`Survive' ~ Separation and estrangement is undeniable now. Now way out of it. But he wills himself to get past it. This is simple acoustic guitar with an electric lead underneath it.<br />\\"I should have kept you<br />I should have tried<br />I should have been a wiser kind of guy<br />I miss you\\"<br /><br />`If I'm Dreaming My Life' ~ He is trying to come to terms with what has happened. Almost like his love was a dream that did not really happen. Or maybe now he is just a walking dream that lost touch with reality.<br />\\"Was she never here...<br />Was it air she breathed<br />At the wrong time<br />On the wrong day<br />All the lights are fading now\\"<br /><br />`Seven' ~ This is Bowie's fourth song in the last two albums that shares its name with a movie. But it has nothing in common with the movie. It is about someone that has seven days to live. He sings of memories of his family, while trying to choose the way he wants to die. The loss fits in well with the songs around it.<br />\\"A city full of flowers<br />A city full of rain<br />I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die\\"<br /><br />`What's Really Happening?' ~ Once again he is trying to come to terms with what is going wrong in his love life. It is one long question. Lyrically, story wise, this should have been the second song.<br />\\"All the clouds are made of glass<br />And they're slowly sinking<br />Falling like the shattered past\\"<br /><br />`The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell' ~ He has grown up only to become a mess, spiritually and physically. This is the rocker of the album, which makes it seem out of place after all the contemplative thoughts that came before it.<br />\\"You're still breathing but you don't know why<br />Life's a bitch and sometimes you die\\"<br /><br />`New Angels Of Promise' ~ The angles come down from above to take him away, to the promise of another life? This song is more upbeat than the lyrics would let on.<br />\\"You didn't feel us coming<br />In this lonely crowd, it's always time...<br />We are the silent ones<br />Take us to the edge of time\\"<br /><br />`Brilliant Adventure' ~ The only mystery here might be this Japanese flavored tune, which flutters for about 40 seconds, before repeating itself several times. It is tasteful but out of place, more befitting side two of \\"Heroes\\". He must have wanted to make sure it made it onto an album, and not get left off to become an unknown rare track. There is no other reason I can think of as to why it is on here. Musically it would have sounded more at home as the opener to `New Angels of Promise'. Strange that it did not get placed there. Maybe it was meant to be a dream, which would lead us to...<br /><br />`The Dreamers' ~ He's at the end now. All is done. Life unfulfilled. Unlike the downtrodden lyrical message, the faster pace of this track ends the album on a musical high point.<br />\\"Just a searcher<br />Lonely soul<br />The last of the dreamers<br />So it goes\\"<br /><br />And zap! He is lifted away and it is over.<br /><br />3.5 starsnother life?

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I watched this movie when I was a child and it was one of my favorites. The digitally remastered version is great and my kids 3 and 2 love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was slow to read this book because of the Idea of children killing children. I found that the book compelling with the political undertones.
B000FA675C|5.0|nice to have it conveniently on my phone!  thanks for the freebie!  great deal and love amazon.  woo hoo hoo!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was intense and thrilling. Maggie uses love and relentless passion to show how love means everything to the world. I am 13 and my peers and I are enjoying this book more than anything. I recommend this book to EVERYONE over 13
0307946711|4.0|I liked the story and the characters.  A good read and an original plot.  Kind of wanted to keep track of a single day a year myself.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think this game is way better then leps world 2<br /><br />Lep world2 is just a rip off ok  rip we just killed the club
B00005M91K|5.0|Everyone needs to see this amazing film. I highly recommend it to anyone, and everyone that lives in this world today. It gives a perspective no other film or media presentation even comes close to. I suggest watching it until you finally grasp what the film is trying to tell you. You will be glad you did. Thank you to everyone that made this fantastic film available.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game it has tons of different buildings and a huge ass map an<br />d I love the fact u get to make money
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|GREAT! GREAT! GREAT! A truly wonderful movie experience. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves musicals and believe this can convert those who don't.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game I play this with my son and we have a great time jumping and running from the cop'a and his dog. Great game worth the download bottom line.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this app every day!!!!!!!  it 's AMAZING!!!!!!!!!<br />your this guy your controls. and you can build stuff (I mean anything).
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|love this CD---especially the international numbers. Josh Grogan just gets better! Will probably give  one to<br />my sister on her birthday.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The processing required for higher levels is very hi.  I use an razer max and i get consistent slow down after level 8. I am still playing and currently at level 14.  It is like a watered down tycoon.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I was somewhat leery about purchasing this novel as I love my Bronte books and couldn't imagine someone trying to take up these characters that were originally created so long ago.  But If you love the characters in Pride and Prejudice, then you will enjoy this novel even though it isn't from the original author.  This novel is set a few years after the end of Pride and Prejudice.  The author does write with somewhat of the same feel as Miss Bronte so I was not affronted.  It was nice to visit Pemberley again to see how Elizabeth and Darcy are faring.  It was fun to see Georgianna grown up and to see Jane and Bingley again.  So if you would like to visit the characters you loved so much in Pride and Prejudice, then this is the book for you.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is only because these characters weren't created by P. D. James originally and it just seemed wrong to have them brought back to life by someone else, but she does a good job with them.  Thank you for the visit.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|Being at that concert with my soon to be husband, instantly transported me back in time. Jerry's voice was clear and crisp, and the band was in  good form, in sync, very together, what a night! This concert was a privledge to attend, and the Capitol, what can I say, many a good concert was had there...
B000F8O35U|5.0|I loved this as a child and love it now plus with all the bonus features it was really fascinating to see the making of this wonderful film. I would recommend ordering this DVD of blu ray :)
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Inspirational story of men and their families. LIfe is too busy but should not be an excuse to be less involved in your children's lives and the family.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So far, what I've read has been good. I am just getting started, but it seems to be what I was looking for.<br />Karen
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I chose this rating cause the package came in the time frame that was given to me.  The package was brand new and for a good price.  I would shop with this company again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great read.  The author is so creative, it's no wonder a movie series is being made from this book and the rest of the trilogy.  Even if you've seen the movie, you should still read the book.
6305252572|5.0|I chose this rating cause the package came in the time frame that was given to me.  The package was brand new and for a good price.  I would shop with this company again.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I use this every single day and it's great.  It keeps all of my passwords safe and allows me to just worry about remembering one password.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I liked the portions about her walk on the trail, but was appalled at the reckless and unthinking approach she took to casual hook ups off the trail.  That was a turnoff.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is great.  My husband and I have lists in shared notebooks that allow us to both keep on top of everything.
1423124111|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a gift.  I think I enjoy it more than her since it has really great artwork from all the Disney parks.  Great gift for a Disney fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|hey it's Paige and I want to review this app. It's really fun and its kinda like temple run just in a different way. I really like it and I hope u do too!!!
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|I am a school teacher.  I purchased this movie to play to my class as an Easter GIft.<br />I was unable to play it on my projector with my ipad.  I would not have made<br />the purchase if I'd known about the Airplay through HDMI wasn't available.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!! I wish they would make a second one kinda like how they make a sequel for a movie but instead they would make it for subway surfer!!!!!! I would recommend this game for everyone!!! :) Best game ever!!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If your into this series and don't have HBO this is the way to go.  Price was very reasonable and my husband loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I bought the episodes I hadn't seen so I could be caught up! So worth it! Great quality and no commercials!
B000JIHP88|2.0|I bought this in June last year for my son. Started to use it about 2-3 months ago. We did not use it heavily. On average, we used about 2-3 hour every week. Right now, the leaves stop moving properly. It will move couple seconds, and stop like 5 or 6 minutes, and move again for couple seconds, and stop. Same thing happens even after we put new batteries in.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This is a wonderful show that reminds the children of a few life lessons. We all love it and love to watch it over and over.
0920668372|5.0|This is a heart/soul book that makes a young mother cry and can pass on to the young child who becomes the adult later in life.  I give many of these to expecting mothers as they begin their road to motherhood.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is the best entertainment on the market, it is great to see it going the distance and becoming part of tv history as one of the best shows.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing games on my kindle fire. This game has always been one of my favorites. Too bad there are these pop up ads before each hand. That is the only reason I gave it four stars..
B008J34466|5.0|I have always been a fan, but I have to tell you, this is one of my favorites!  Love the different beats/rhythms.  The music is as varied as the lyrics; from pop to rock, even rap (featuring Eminem).  The songs talk about love, breakups, relationships, in Pink's unique way.  She's got attitude, and it shows in her music!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun!! I love this game because you can build a many houses As<br /><br />you want and you can hide from all the evil villains in survival mode.
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|I had the opportunity to see Robin Trower in a very small venue in the winter of 2011.  I was not a huge fan, but took the opportunity to see him based on his status and reputation. He affirmed on that occasion that he truly is a master of the instrument.  Being a blues lover, however, I wished at that time that he had a blues recording.  Well, here it is.  He is still a master.  The songs are classics and covers, but they are very well done and his guitar work is as deft as ever.  This is a wonderful set.  Very glad to have purchased it.  Many listenings so far and it continues to be thoroughly enjoyable.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really liked this book. My favorite was probably those last few words said at the end you are a wonder. This is really an inspiration.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I have been listening on the radio to endless playing of stronger, which drove me to buy the greatest hits.  Good CD
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was s great I love the lol live story very sexy can't wait to read the third book
0765325950|5.0|After waiting so long for the story to climax, my expectations were very high.  The story tellers wrote a convincing ending, with joy, sadness, and the beginning of another turn of the wheel
B000002MG1|5.0|I consider Chronic Town through Automatic some of the best albums REM has ever recorded. This is a nice, smooth mix of songs and will always be a favorite of mine I reach for.  Peter's solo on Drive is haunting, as are Michael's lyrics.  You can't beat Mike's backing vocals on any of the songs too. (Wish he sang lead on at least 1 track!)  Love the mix of instruments, the piano, mandolin and acoustics. BEAUTIFUL is the word I would use to describe this album.  This is a CD to take with you to a desert island.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is a terrific Bond and this episode connects the dots of over 50 years of character development, but putting its own spin on some while paving the way for the next in the series. Strong characters will ensure the momentum will continue.
B000002LOE|5.0|This is one of the CDs I would take with me to a deserted island hands down. So many jangly, bright numbers mixed in with pensive songs like \\"Low\\" and \\"Belong\\". Another treat is Mike Mills' lead vocal on 2 songs. He never sang lead enough in my humble opinion.  Love the mix of instruments. It's a very cohesive album and a MUST for any music lover.  I consider this a jewel in the crown of their career. I never get tired of it. It makes me feel old though when I realize how long this album has been out.
B009AMANBA|3.0|very disappointed in this film.  the only interesting scene is at the end.  d. daylewis and t.lee jones were excellent but not able to carry the whole film.  a very mediocre film.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I think this is a decent Tom Clancy book.  The plot was premised on something that is going on now - cyber attacks.  It was a good read with a fast finish, but kept me entertained.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Now there is a big difference in the Apple product and the imitation. This works as it should, like the saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Oh well, you live and learn.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Weir has taken a certain death scenario - being abandoned on Mars - and turned it into an extended struggle for life that would tax even Bear Grylls' survival skills.<br /><br />Certainly, Weir's Book Description (which merely says \\"The adventures of an astronaut stranded on Mars\\") does not sound like a compelling read.<br /><br />But the biography of astronaut Mark Watney, stranded through a freak accident during a mission to Mars, is rich in humanity and chock loaded with the minutia of hard sci-fi technical details that I enjoy reading. And while I've not googled anything to confirm it, I suspect that most of the facts and figures that overlay Watney's new mission parameters are as correct as current knowledge can make them.<br /><br />Fortunately, Weir recognises that having us turn page after page of Watney's diary will, ultimately, not hold most readers interest so he cannily breaks out of this and introduces other characters and situations - NASA Mission Control, the crew that left Watney behind, the Chinese equivalent of NASA, etc - as a third person narrative. These different perspectives add considerable tension to the story, as for the most part all the players are physically remote and suffer a considerable communication delay, and their feeling of helplessness is well conveyed.<br /><br />Watney himself is old-school. He calls himself a nerd but is very much a hands-on, can-do type of guy. When misfortune befalls him he gets back up, dusts himself off (often literally, Mars is seriously dusty) and gets right back into the thick of the fight. That fight, of course, is for his life and Watney seems too busy or too optimistic to experience much in the way of depression. He should be British for his upper lip is stiffer than carbon fibre ever can be. He also has a pretty hip sense of humour, which was apparently one of the attributes that the NASA psychologists liked him for. There were more than a few laugh out loud moments in \\"The Martian\\" but it is not written as a comedy, that was just incidental to Weir making Watney a very believable character.<br /><br />Of course, his encyclopaedic knowledge is unlikely, even for an astronaut, but it does not detract from the fun. This is a story after all, and who wants to read about a haphazard fool who can't make it through the opening chapters? And while Watney continually praises the NASA and JPL design engineers who make equipment Tonka Tough such that it lasts way beyond its duty cycle, I did wonder a few times just how far said equipment would stretch in the extenuating circumstances.<br /><br />But there are very few negatives with \\"The Martian\\" and Weir keeps us guessing about the outcome right up to the end, so if you like Boy's Own Adventures of any kind you should enjoy this book.ritten as a comedy, that was just incidental to Weir making Watney a very believable character.<br /><br />Of course, his encyclopaedic knowledge is unlikely, even for an astronaut, but it does not detract from the fun.

B000BTGY1O|4.0|This movie is hard to find on VHS anymore, but the overall quality and condition of the DVD was awesome.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful series.  Can't get enough.  You'll be drawn in by the engaging story line after only one show.  It's great!
B00008972S|5.0|The story is timeless... It points out that there are no barriers when you love someone, but there are barriers that are taught if we choose to hate, based on culture or skin color.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|All the songs on this album have great beats and many will doubtless become hits.  For those with younger kids who are sensitive to strong language, though, you might want to avoid.  I love it, though, and would give it my strongest recommendation.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I forgot how good the music was....  Again.. If I have to write an article please don not ask me to review anything.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|i luv this game fast paced no glitches like others games or apps I have..I recommend this game for everyone
0375869026|5.0|i've always been able to reflect the emotions of characters in a book. if they're embarrassed, i'm embarrassed. if they're sad, im sad.<br />a few times ive come across endings that make me really happy.<br />but this book. wonder by RJ Palacio...this is the happiest a book has every made me. i was crying as i finished the book. august pullman. enough said
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My husband and I as well as our daughters all take turns playing!! Clean and safe game, it's so much fun!! =)
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a well written book with good character development and unexpected twists that will keep your interest.  Best of her books so far.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|But this was well done and I LOVE Jeffrey Dean Morgan (worth it alone). It was both scary/creepy enough to intrigue horror fans but also just a good dramatic movie as well. Ending was a tad predictable (to me anyway) but still very well done.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I always do a lot of research before making a purchase. I thought I was buying a quality product, but this item worked properly for one day only. It has not worked since. I'd suggest buying a different charger.
B000LJAEFG|5.0|An old favorite I had to see again. Recommend it highly to anyone to young to remember it but loves Sci-Fi.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Truth to be told, the first book was so good it got me through the subsequent two books. This one in particular was terrible. It sounded very, very unrealistic and the characters actually fell out of character. It wasn't dark, it was EMO-meets-moronic. Any fanfic-er could have done a better job.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Bought this as a vacation Kindle addition.  It was not memorable for me, but just a good read on vacation.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|It is good but a little slow for me. I thought it would be a little bit more faster that it was.
B000FC10WU|4.0|It was good and hard to 'help solve.'  I enjoy working along with them, and trying to solve the mystery with them.

0857685848|5.0|The illustrations in this book are beautiful. Art lovers with a interest in ancient life will find this book fasinating.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I saw them tour this  album and it was just like being there again!  One of the best bands around when I was growing up....great experience!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Graphics are superb. Story/plot holds up. Plenty of hidden object scenes. Just as good as the Theatre of the Absurd.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Love Kate Morton. This may be her best yet. I was completely hooked. She wove an intriguing story, great characters, with a fitting title.  Highly recommend!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I see you have made some improvements the graphics are much better and I love the dinosaurs. Worth downloading the worlds are very well done.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The car goes where the eyes go. I have read many books and never took the time to review them. Nor will I do that now, but simply state that this book represents connectivity to our true souls, the earth we all return to and paying our time forward even when we have suffered. More so because we have suffered. Mistakes are inherit to our nature. What has happened is merely a vessel to move us forward and learn of what could be. To ride like a champion, it hands must be loose but confident in knowing what turn u have come out of and the feeling of the turn ahead, your commitment to it. Your car goes where he eyes go.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a follow up to Born To Run. It was motivating and honest in a way that brought Scott Jurek out as a real person rather than a character in a book. I particularlied enjoyed the account of his childhood and the motivations that led him to running. Many people from similar backgrounds can pull inspiration from Scott's story.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider solitare keeps you moving . I can not stop playing it. The deck is easy to see, it doesn't freeze up.
B00006GA4C|5.0|One of the 2 best albums GFR ever recorded. The sound is perfect and the price great. What could be better?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is everything you want in a bible and, alot more . It is the best I have seen in on line bibles.The only thing that it would make better if you would have it in spanish.
B00006GA48|5.0|One of the 2 best albums GFR ever recorded. The sound is perfect and the price great. What could be better?
B000ASDFEU|5.0|The movie was great. The added parts on how the movie was made was great. I would definitely buy this DVD again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app on my Kindle Fire and with a bit of help from the internet have managed to download and install it onto my Blackberry Playbook too. Great!
B0002PZVHK|5.0|This is probably my most played CD ever. Back when I was a college student, I'd put it on shuffle/repeat and let it run 24/7, carefully balancing the volume so that the output blended equally with whatever noise was in the environment at the time. It has a certain way of 'unifying' the environment, evening out distractions and setting up a kind of focused space very conducive to thinking. I found I could study longer and more effectively when it was playing. But make no mistake, this isn't 'background music', it's a whole 'nother thing. Eno nails it when he recommends going easy on the level. Years later I can still listen to it any time. It's my favorite of Eno's Ambient series by far. Very nice contributions by Bill Laswell, who apparently outlasted most of the other musicians Eno used on the sessions, and I guess he was actually the only one who made it to the end of the project with Eno... maybe that's because it was Laswell's studio.  ;-)  Highly recommended!
B005ES11M4|4.0|love this style more than other style of Crocs. So I bought another one for myself. This gray one is for my husband.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|My favorite movie. And cheap as hell. How could it be bad. This is my second copy. Wore out the other. So cheap and fast shipping
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Wherever you put Tommy Lee Jones, he'll shine every time, even on a corrupt Louisiana bayou.  Enjoyable, suspenseful,<br /><br />on the edge of your chair drama. Great job! Well done
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I like the back story about his family and it was a good way to get a new M.  But why make him old and less bond like.  What happened to the gadgets?
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|I love this Robert Plant CD. The music is really nice to listen to. I recommend it highly to people who like Robert Plant and something different to listen to. Has many catchy tunes on it.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Good action, but the JB formula is getting old.  Theirs no real suspense, you know what's going to happen before it does.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This movie is fantastic action packed and riveting.  This is one movie we are keeping in our collection for a long time.
B00000634J|5.0|Fast delivery and product in very good condition. Ended up that there were only a couple of songs on the cd that I liked, but hey, it was my first John lennon cd.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|However they made this movie I am very grateful.  This is a good lesson on humanity and it lets you see another world and their diversity and just how they all get along.  Earth men should stay on Earth since we are such a violent culture...sad.  But this movie is like the best alien movie ever!
0061122416|5.0|This book was amazing. It inspired me to really look at myself and see what's my personal legend. I'm going through a life changing experience and sometimes I need book to help me understand things that I don't know or that people can't teach me.<br /><br />It really is a great book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|If this book was the first book I had read by this author I would never have read another book by her. She does explore a topic, unsatisfied marriage, in a very unique way and does it with genius. The book fails in the end and leaves you wanting more, perhaps that is the point.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book... in some ways reminds me of Beautiful Disaster (not plot or anything, just tone). Def. a gut-wrencher with a killer love story, long-kept secrets and emotional turmoil! Highly Recommend!
0736092269|5.0|Great artwork and descriptions.  This book does a nice job of combining (get this) strength training AND anatomy!  Pretty obvious I know, but many books do not deliver as promised.  This one is no BS, no advertising, no personal opinions, just good, solid information.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was one of many that I brought and I must say it was the best of the bunch!
B003FSTN52|5.0|I'm a fan of this series, but I didn't start watching until season 2. Happy to get this video for a good price and delivered quickly so as to see how the story begins.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book and loved the movie, though the movie was different in many ways. I loved the characters, with all their flaws.  The book is an easy read, but also deep and affecting.  I can't find the words to describe it, it's a Godiva chocolate of a book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I know my review will be no where near as amazing as the book, so let me just say BUY IT- READ IT - then READ IT again. The minute i closed this book I wanted to start reading all over again. It was descriptive beyond words - so beautiful - and has so many wonderful stories inside going on that all NEED to be told. Im just speechless. I believe this is THE best book I have read in my entire life. Ever.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Well written and Mitch Rapp again meets all my expectations.  The writer does his home work and writes with passion.  Loved the book and all his other books.  I like his characters in the book which makes it a good read.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed this book - and NO part of it seemed familiar to me - until one very specific part at the end. Then i stopped and questioned as to whether i had read this before. I cant remember reading it - yet that scene seemed SO familiar to me. I doubt there is another book with it - I just dont know. I loved this story. I felt so bad for Camille and wanted to smack her mom constantly. I cant imagine growing up in such a distant and difficult atmosphere. But people do. Not everyone is meant to be a mother.
B00BUL0IHI|2.0|Couple good/ok tracks. No where close to his past albums. Seems like many of the tracks were thrown on here to make it an \\"album\\". Im a Wayne fan...I still stand by his music. Not sure if there will ever be another album like Carter iii.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I found this book to be very dark - but in such a good way. This was my first foray into Gillian Flynn's work and Im glad that it was - I can see what the hype is about. I like the way the book seems to be written with brutal honesty from the protagonists side - yet in a completely clouded way. Very good book.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|Was recommended this book, seems a bit of a silly sory, almost child-like, but having said that I enjoyed having a laugh. Certainly light reading.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The movie was great. The playback quality on Amazon sucked!!!  With all the re-buffering took me 4 hours to watch a 2 1/2 hour movie. Frustrating as hell!!! Last time I spend money on a movie from Amazon.  I'll stick with NetFlix!
1616550414|5.0|The book that every gamer need to read. It's more than a book, it's a legend wrote in special words.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love this series.  Julianna is a fav of mine.  Would recommend watching this season. Very good show. The Good Wife.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was Stephen King at the top of his game. Good character development. Nice application of history telling mixed with a touch of time travel.
1596177373|1.0|My order has not arrived even if it's been two months since I placed and paid it. How I can I get my money back?
B005COO1X6|3.0|Not Stephen Kings best work for sure!  Not much character development but it was an interesting study in weirdness on the interstate.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|every g5 game i play helps pass the time better than anything else when i have free time in the truck. Keep the gamescoming .
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|After listening to the disc a few times I have fallen in love with it. I have ordered the Blue Ray 5.1 to get the full effect.
B00B2Q9NM2|4.0|WAY COOL!<br />It's about time someone started doing KUNG FU type movies in the old traditions.<br />Lots of fun!<br />Batista played a great bad guy.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is addicting!<br />Lots of fun.  I keep coming back to play it and try to beat my latest score.  You should definitely buy this game.
B007NR9WBG|3.0|I don't understand why so many people are focused on the SE...and not the actual movie. I can understand that to an extent, but....oh well.<br /><br />Anywho...I think the concept of the movie was very futuristic and visionary considering the time it was made. That being said, I think the film in more competent hands directorial and scriptural wise would've meant it would've been more widely praised. I remember when this came out people had high hopes for it and it tanked HUGE at the box-office for simple acting and script reasons.  I can see why. The acting was actually pretty bad. I can't blame the actors totally because the director is the one whose supposed to catch issues and give, well, 'direction'.  Not so in this one. In the beginning, the acting was very...fake, from hand gestures, to just really lame script.  There were some other glaring issues, like that Gordon 'scientist' who was CONSTANTLY acting like an ape in heat, and they were acting like, 'no problem', yeah I think not!<br /><br />I think the film had promise, but it should've been relegated to a director and script specialist who understood the nuances of  everyday dialogue and natural 'speak'.  I cringed when one of the gov't imps pointed to his head and said, \\"they'll be able to plug right into the ol' noodle.\\"  Um, really?  Even back in the 80's people didn't talk like that.  Oy.<br /><br />I think this would make a PHENOM re-make today. With the CGI and tech stuff they have it could be amazing. I could totally see Hugh Jackman as 'Michael'...Rachel Weiz as his wife (Natalie Woods character, whom I cannot remember her name), and maybe Rene Russo as Lillian.  With the great actors today and all the amazing SE/CGI, this would be a fabulous project.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This book generates a good deal of thought and is an excellent choice for a book group for that reason.  The literary and mathematical references make it stimulating, while the boy's personal challenges create a good deal of empathy for him--and for the trial it must be for parents in dealing with such a child.  The book's perspective  gives a unique glimpse into the mind of an indivual with this type of autism.
1433535734|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is great, but it is so much that it is hard make small enough to carry around, while also making the print large enough for my eyes to read.  This one strikes that balance.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|it is not a stand alone game, need to stay connected to the internet to continue.  Not exciting enough to stay connected.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is a funny show and it is great to see the faces of the little ones as they dance to the music.

0062103377|5.0|It was a gift and the person that received the book was over joyed with it and wants more, thanks.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series because it has a lot of twists and I love the romance. I think this is the next twilight.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|This is the most consistent record DB's done in a long time. I actually like a lot of the stuff on Heathen and Reality, and to be honest, I think that each of those previous records arguably boast 1 or 2 tracks that may be better than anything on The Next Day. Overall, however the Next Day is just so darn solid.<br />  It could actually benefit some trimming. if it was a 10 Tracks, eliminating some of the fat, it would probably be the best record he's done in several decades. I think if this record had been released after \\"Scary Monsters\\", before \\"Let's Dance\\", That people would not so much refer to the \\"Berlin Trilogy\\" as much as they would simply refer to \\"that amazing five album stretch from 'Low' to 'The Next Day\\".  With the exception of (imho) \\"If you can see me\\", there are really no duds on this set.<br />  All of that said, seriously, I have to take back one star, (I almost took back two), for the severe distortion and clipping going on in the upper ranges, creating distortion, and a wierd sort of flatness, to songs that seem like they would sound so much richer and textured if the damn songs were allowed to breath.<br />  Instead, we have one more victim of the \\"loudness wars\\". I kind of wish I would have just waited to see what kind of reviews the vinyl gets, I can only hope it's not clipped to heck as well (how can people listen to that, and not hear the horrible distortion and flatness?) Anyway, I live in hope that the vinyl will have the kind of range that this richly layered, and extremely worthy collection of songs deserves.<br /><br />***Update, I purchased the vinyl, in the hopes the mastering was different, but honestly, it sounds just as bad. Very disappointing.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Rating it 5/5 stars doesn't even come close to describing how well written and amazing this book is.<br />Night Circus, as the title of this review describes, far exceeds expectations. The imagery, the depth of the characters, and just the overall flow of the novel, come together so beautifully. It was nearly impossible for me to put this novel down and even then I finished this nearly 450 paged book in one day.<br />If there was ever a book that needed to be a staple in every home, this would be the book.<br />Erin Morgenstern does what I dream to do when I become an author. She digs deep into the imaginations that we all accessed when we were children and she weaves them into a story that intrigues the interest of any reader. Spells and enchantments are the stories of fairy tales but Erin Morgenstern brings these fictional genres to life and applies them to a romantic and riveting story that anyone would fall in love with.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who still dreams, anyone with a passion for the magic and wonder hidden beneath the surface of the world, and anyone wanting to be transported to a wonderland of fantasy.
1476712042|5.0|I thought this was a very good read, a love story with a lot of emotion. People and relationships are not perfect but we find ways to work them out.  It was fiction and people need to remember that when reading it. I have read some reviews where it says it gives a bad image for young girls and &#34;bad&#34; boys.... Part of reading is to get out of your element and into a fantasy... Or at least thats how I feel. And this book did that. Personally people need to loosen up and not take things so literally! It is a book!

B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie especially since it was based on actual events.  The swearing could have been less.  Good purchase.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|He loved it and surprisingly, the bat plane is still together.  Great way for kids to learn how to follow directions and build.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers drew me in on page 1 and kept me until the very end.  Each character is beautifully developed - warts and all.  The flow of this book was similar to Secret Life of Bees and every bit as endearing.  I have recommended this book to every intelligent woman I know.

B000001IQH|5.0|what i can i say i love rancid music i lot im very happy with this cd the third album is great
B001TM14VC|3.0|This movie is definitely dated at this point. I saw it years ago and it seemed much better at that time.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I think this is a very owesome game nd I luv playing it all day long. I also love the graphics of the game and as well the strength of the warrior. I will love more of such games because it keeps me company and I love playing it.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|It makes me wonder though, how real is it vs. how much poetic license did the producers inject.  I'm left with the distinct impression, our CIA needs more agents like Maya, and fewer nimrods like the executives above her.  Maybe if we had fewer nimrods and more Quality agents, 9-11 may have been prevented.
0316017930|5.0|A family member insisted that I purchase this, and I was quite amazed at the conclusions in it. I recommended to an intellectual relative who also was pleased to receive it.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|it was good at first before the game makes you pay real money. a pet can cost up to 50-100 dollars! this game is not free at all and most of the request makes you pay real money to a pet I can't skip it because I don't have any bling to do so there making you pay real money to get bling this app is not free
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Use it all the time and love it! My computer away from the computer! isn't it funny how we are so addicted to the internet!
1607066017|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a comic this engaging. The characters and their motivations seem real, and I really like the conceit of having the baby being the narrator (at some unspecified point in the future).<br /><br />Caveat emptor: however excellent, this is not for kids or the faint of heart. There's violence, strong language, and nudity in it, but for those of you who don't mind that, pick this up. It's worth a read! (Or two, or three . . .)
B0064X7FVE|3.0|And it works ok, but for our area another app worked better..so I use another one. Sorry. Thanks though. Bye

B005K17RU0|5.0|Works like a charm! Has my local weather every time and the temp is pretty close to the actual temp!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|When I discovered my new MacBook required a &#34;new&#34; (MagSafe2) connector for the charger, I was discouraged.  When I saw that I could use this converter and buy a less expensive MageSafe charger as my secondary charger, that helped.<br /><br />Works just fine.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Addicted and have to play at least once a day, if not all night sometimes! Wow what a great game!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I dont know why dvd's are included in the Blu Ray pack. Havent touched them since I've opened the packaging.<br />Overall amazing packing, Video and audio quality is top notch

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really don't like hidden object games but I love this one. the storyline is awesome and you get tons of hints. I recommend that everyone plays this game. so fun
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love having it bigger than my phone, works so nice!! Thanks for having the app work so slick! Whoo hoo!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This writer has a writing style that keeps your attention.  She took the world by storm and she helped a lot of people overcome their hang ups.  There is nothing wrong with a little sex that is out of the ordinary, as long as it pleases both adults.  I could not put this book down and can not wait for book three.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is a great app, and I am so glad you have made it kindle available! Thank you so much!
