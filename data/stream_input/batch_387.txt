B00018D3RI|5.0|Great job, throughout the DVD package.  20 hours of Starsky and Hutch has me rewinding my memory of when I was seven years old and watching the cops catch the bad guys.  Twenty three episodes from 1975.  The original pilot with Richard Ward playing Captain Dobey.  Richard Ward played the father in Steve Martin's The Jerk, but I remember him most in Brubaker, the Redford movie where he played a prisoner that had served too much time and coffin maker for the previous warden.  Gordon Jump also is in the pilot as a gym owner, before his jobs at WKRP and the Maytag repairman.  It has interviews of the creater William Blinn, Antonio Fargas, David Soul, and Paul Michael Glazer.  It even has a fan, who purchased one of the Torino's used for the show.  I didn't know the Gran Torino had a 460 engine.  Also, it has the tv promo spots telling about the next show.  That isn't done like it used to be, with the stars from the show teasing you about the next show.  Thanks to Amazon for delivering fast and with no problems.  Starsky and Hutch fans this is it, you are gonna love this set.  Now, it is time to start pressing for The Six Million Dollar Man set.  Where's Steve Austin, Oscar Goldman, and Lindsey Wagner?  An astronaut barely alive, we have the technology to rebuild him, better, faster, stronger.......Where else could you see an astronaunt fighting Bigfoot!!
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones's &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; was a dazzling blend of jazz, country, blues, and pop, and stood out so well it not only sold 8 million+ copies, it garnered 8 Grammys. She is definitely a worthy talent. From her talent of gently tickling the ivories to her smoky, gorgeous jazz-honed voice, she has it all. If anything was wrong with her previous formula, however, it was that the album's mood became stale as one slow slong blended into another. That is not the case with her impressive sophomore shot, &quot;Feels Like Home.&quot;<br />First single &quot;Sunrise&quot; is a bright, jazzy number. Most importantly, however, it is mid-tempo. Norah wants the listener to know that this album is not the same as her debut. And it isn't. Norah throws in several mid-tempo tracks among the gleaming slow jazz numbers. &quot;Creepin' In&quot; (a countrified duet with Dolly Parton) is undoubtedly the fastest on the CD, with it's jumpy banjo score. &quot;In The Morning&quot; quickly picks up speed, and &quot;Above Ground&quot; has a snappy, glorious chorus. <br />Jones, however, doesn't completely abandon her debut's formula. Songs such as &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; (set over Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia&quot;), the smooth &quot;Toes,&quot; and the quietly escalating &quot;Carnival Song&quot; are silky and quiet, but not dull. Jones also utilizes more electric guitar and brasher snare drums in these songs, giving them a substantially bigger kick. The lyrics are also very well done. Jones gives almost all members of her band a chance to contribute lyrically, and that gives the album several interesting lyrical quirks and idiosyncracies, which makes it all the more appealing.<br />Jones is gracefully evolving into a better balanced artist, seamlessly blending mid-tempo songs with low key jazz numbers. She also puts her simply stunning voice to better use on this album, which is perhaps her most unique asset. While she may not be 100% jazz, she certainly is one of the few to truly bring jazz to the forefront of contemporary music. Jones is truly a visionary of her time. She is introducing a new generation to a contemporary spin on blues, and she is doing the genre right. Excellent job.
1400031362|5.0|Precious Ramotswe turned a legacy from cattle-breeding into a novel enterprise.  She runs the only Ladies-run detective agency in Botswana.  The business, however, struggles for survival as she's more helpful than profit-minded.  Her secretary, Mma Makutsi, proves unexpectedly astute in helping to solve the crisis.  She receives a promotion.  In fact, she garners two promotions as Mma Ramotswe's fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekone, develops mental problems.<br />Mma Makutsi achieves a greater level of exposure in this third volume of McCall Smith's series.  The attention seems well deserved.  She branches out in unexpected ways and proves both caring and efficient.  These aren't traits common in management - at least in this reviewer's experience.  But Botswana is a different place, as Mma Ramotswe continually reminds us.  Even &quot;knocking&quot; on the door of the house you're visiting is different from what we're used to.  Tradition is strong in Botswana, but the modern, Western world makes intrusions.  McCall Smith, through Mma Ramostswe and others, notes these clashes with style and wit.  His discussion of studies of the &quot;criminal type&quot; raises an old spectre - but is it a grim one?<br />Men in general come in for a thorough drubbing in this volume.  The young men are indolent and unreliable, spending too much thought on young women.  Older men are arrogant and unreliable, spending to much time taking up with young women.  Even Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges with an unresolved shadow in his past.  A grudging respect is granted to, of all people, a man running beauty contests.  Women bear the burdens of responsibility and labour with little recognition of their worth.  It all reads a bit like Gloria Steinem in her more turbulent days.  One can only hope that this series will redress some of this condemnation in a later volume.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]
B00000JCOV|2.0|I used to like this band, but after getting a reality check new bands like Shadows Fall and Lamb of God, they are just a bunch of posers. Honestly there's 9 members and 2 percussionists playing trash cans and they suck at it! Most of the guitars sound just like Korn(who i also dispise). The only talented mebers are corey and joey. If you want good nu metal, check out Nothingface and Kittie. Slipknot is just a kid's clothing line.
0385512104|4.0|No need to rehash the plot of this one, suffice to say the author's voice is unique and compelling.  A much misunderstood illness, the author has successfully brought a human face, plenty of wry humour, and a large measure of understanding to the subject of autism.  This quick read is thoroughly enjoyable and quite unlike anything I've read before.  If you enjoyed this novel I would also recommend \\"When I was Five I Killed Myself\\" by Howard Buten, another fine novel told from the perpective of an autistic child.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Actually give this one 4 1/2 stars.  Much closer to the spirit of the comics than the first movie.  General Stryker hates mutants even though his son is one.  He has a beef with Professor X and his school and begins his hunt against the mutants.<br />Not only that, but Stryker knows Wolverine from the past and while not going into detail, it's clear he was the one who gave Wolverine is adamantite claws and bone augmentation as a weapon.  Again, staying somewhat true to his Weapon X origins.<br />Several new X-men are along for the ride, most notably the spectacular Nightcrawler who has a fantastic sequence where he teleports through the Whitehouse taking out guards in order to kill the president.<br />We also see Bobby Drake as Iceman, Pyro, and a short cameo with the armor skinned Colossus as a student in the school.<br />Also back is Ian McKellan as Magneto and Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique,who joins forces with the X-men to fight Stryker and his troops.<br />Much better story than the first movie and more exciting.  Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler get the bulk of the character development at the expense of Cyclops and Rogue who have rather minimal roles in the movie.<br />The DVD is loaded with many extras and multiple commentaries.  One of the best DVDs of 2003.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Six Feet Under is one of the best shows I have seen, with the exception of the third season, and finally, I can add the second season to my collection.  The second season is much like the first season, interpersonal reations exposed through conversations with the deceased patrons of their establishment, sex, lies, the usual and unusual.  The third season went horribly wrong between the first and thirteenth episodes, when they walked away from the formula that worked, but successfully regained composure in the end.  For issues like homosexuality, corporation take over, death, life, sex, career, the cast tries to find their way through the world.  This is a very good show and well worth paying to watch, except the third season, take a nap through that.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Great movie, highly recommend.<br />The only caution that I can think of is language.  It was much stronger than I had anticipated, and would caution you if that is something you have trouble with, beware.<br />Make sure to watch the historical documentary in the DVD extras section.
B0000CABBW|5.0|'Whale Rider' was a shock for me.  I had no expectations for it, other than knowing that (a) Keisha Castle-Hughes got an Oscar nomination for it; (b) it had been very well-reviewed by the mainstream movie press; and (c) the track record for New Zealand filmmaking over the last couple of years (as exemplified by Peter Jackson) has been very, very strong.<br />Even with all that factored in, 'Whale Rider' was still a complete shock: it is nothing short of wondrous filmmaking.  If you liked the message of empowerment carried by films such as 'Bend It Like Beckham,' then 'Whale Rider' will make your spirits soar.<br />Oh, and believe it: Keisha Castle-Hughes - born of an Australian father and a NZ Maori mother - deserves that Oscar nomination.  It's very hard to believe this was her first time on a movie set.  She is electric.  You will have no problem envisioning Castle-Hughes' &quot;Pai&quot; as the next Maori 'great leader.'  In fact, everyone in the movie has it figured out, save the one that matters: her grandfather and current leader, Koro (in a fierce portrayal by Rawiri Paratene).  What will it take to get him to see it?  Nothing short of a simply amazing event.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, so did my husband.  However I would not show it to it's target audience.  There were some things that I would not let children see.<br />Several areas of language, either used in joking, and covered up by a rhyming word, or &quot;donkey&quot; jokes.<br />One scene that made me gasp, when I thought about the kids seeing it was when the prince looked under the covers while pondering his princess!  I couldn't believe that that was in a movie, where the majority of the audience is under 13!<br />Enough said, but I would caution parents preview this before allowing your children to see it.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|THE MUSIC ....is absolutely wrong. Allthogh I am a fan of the latest trend in dance music , 80's throwbacks, and even Electroclash. It would be nice if the music matched the time that the story took place. There is no hint of real late 80's Early 90's club music. I think it makes the story a little unrealistic, and if you didnt know it was based on a true story, you would never guess. The club scene is nothing like how it was then, and it seems like the movie is trying to make it seem like New York night life is still as amazing as it was when Micheal Alig ruled the party scene. You could tell the actors struggled with the characters at the start , but became more convincing as it went on. Its worth watching if you don't know the story, but not as great as I hoped.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I have already had a week to listen to this album (I bought it before anyone else got it!) and I can say this much...it is honestly my favorite of all of Corpse's albums.  The songs are far more complicated then before, more tempo changes, existent double bass (the last cd's was paper-thin) and razor sharp guitars.  George's vocals are better than ever.  This is the first album I can honestly say that the DVD helped.  It highlights the work in the studio, if a normal music person saw this they would respect this band a whole lot more.  I can't say enough good things about this cd.  Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
1558216847|5.0|In a place so bleak, to find a bit of compassion from such an unlikely source that leads a courageous group to freedom....This was a great story. I'm grateful to be an American who has not endured war, prison, or work camps.   I have passed the book on to numerous people who also couldn't put it down!
0060934913|4.0|Who knew the world of the chef bubbles with desperation, envy, substance abuse and a rebel, elitist pride in boasting about the burns, blisters, and cuts on their hands and forearms? I've never encountered a group of people who were at once so passionate about food and cooking, yet were such brilliant socio-paths that their organization and connectedness is mesmerizing. As a chef for over the last 20+ years, Bourdain's tone runs from the comedic to Homeric in detailing the frenetic-paced itineraries of running restaurants and dealing with the people in them. The stoves burn like battle tanks and the alleyway is a trench. This back of the house account at haute cuisine bistros and grease-trap seafood shacks is marvelous from start to finish. The exploits on famous chefs and infamous food suppliers abound through a wondrous and obscene lexicon of kitchen talk. In his last chapter, Bourdain relates his astronomical gastronomical feat of eating in Tokyo: a truly lurid and Dionysian challenge. Do you ever want to look away from the pay counter at yiour local fast food joint when the employees are stacking your sandwich? I do. Do you feel more comfortable in an upscale eatery? Perhaps. But you still shouldn't order fish on Sunday or Monday.
0440237688|3.0|If I didn't have to read this book for a class I would have read three pages and put it back on the shelf.  After reading it and and understanding the message the author was trying to send I realized that the book was a nice little bit of literature.  It put across to me that all of the little differences in the world should be celebrated, not shunned.  All of the little things in life aren't appreciated, and I think Lois Lawry is trying to tell us to wake up and look around at all of the beauty in our world before we destroy it.
B0001ADB8C|4.0|As far as it goes, yes, almost all of this has been released on CD before, but you know what, this set SOUNDS so MUCH BETTER that the others are like cheap cut-outs. George's solo career was rather consistent. He never wrote silly love songs, he did lean toward faith inspired ballads, and his wry take on life was thoroughly infectious and clearly focused. <BR>His less than stellar moments were the CD DARK HORSE, not included here as it was on Capitol records, and SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND. These tended to be momentary lapses of focus in otherwise brilliantly consistent songwriting career, espousing a roots oriented production aesthetic that would not catch favour again until Uncle Tupelo. But even as weak as SOMEWHERE is, it nonetheless contains enough strengths to indicate that George's lesser material was as good as anybody's best. Too frequently, George was viewed as a man out of time: he embraced being completely out of step with whatever was passing for a given year's fab conceits. And who knew better what a load of rubbish that was anyway?<BR>To listen again to 33 &amp; 1/3, GEORGE HARRISON, and CLOUD NINE is to be reminded of his sheer genius. Theses discs are light years away from ALL THINGS and Phil Spector, and were what made the extraordinary Travelling Wilburys possible. As much as the Byrds and The Band were responsible for drawing out the enormous importance of Dylan in his early career, it was Harrison who sustained Dylan's deserved reputation and in fact, breathed new life into it when Dylan himself seemed at 6's and 7's about his own future.<BR>What is exceptionally of value here is the DVD, which contains the whumsical videos George did for his MTV moments, again, with tongue absolutely in cheek, and the footage in concert in Japan. George was never comfortable on tour after Beatlemania. Can't blame him. How painful it was is evident in the DVD tracks, as is the supreme bond of friendship between George and Eric Clapton. Forget about the images and listen, and what you have are moments of two friends playing off each other rhapsodically. The live CD of that tour holds up exceptionally well, 12 years later.<BR>I don't suppose a casual listener would ever take up George Harrison. He is a guitar player's writer and a musician of uncompromising taste. The out takes are all inetresting, and about the only thing worth salvaging from the Madonna virused film he produced. (She is a disease). The other tracks are a mix of graceful humour and humble songcraft in progress and worth the punts necessary.<BR>The Beatles were not and hopefully will never be, much for loading up their discs with demos and junk that just wasn't good. McCartney said at the conclusion of ANTHOLOGY, that that was it. Well, maybe the roof top concert. But so it should be. They knew as a band and as solo artists what was the real deal, and had no interest in being known for knackering their fans. Pity Costello missed that day in class. This is a great box set from one of the four reasons everybody else got into the business. Come listen to what it means to do your job well.
B000063CPL|4.0|Iron Maiden still ripping it up after almost 3 decades? Indeed. Powering through nearly 30 years of hits and some newer cuts, these guys never seem to get tired. Although their new three guitar lineup slightly drowns out Steve Harris's monster bass skills, the return of Bruce Dickinson makes everything better. All in all, a fine album. I would also suggest getting the DVD. UP THE IRONS!!!
B0001ENY6M|3.0|The best thing about LAST TEMPTATION was Peter Gabriel's score. Turns out it is the best thing about this film as well. I'm not sure how Gibson copped a songwriting credit, but the whole thing is a Hollywoodization of the textures assembled by Gabriel. Is it good? Yeah. But I already own PASSION. So, it would be nice if the 2 guys claiming credit for this music would at least acknowledge that, perhaps, like George Harrison, they did not really know they were lifting music wholecloth.
B000001G16|5.0|This is a master piece by the legend, Mr Richie Sambora. The best song on the LP is def &quot;Father Time&quot;. It is Class. Definitely better than Undiscovered Soul, the guitar riffs are super and this genuis is just a damn legend!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This had to be the worst movie I have ever sat through.  Boring, pointless, dull, no story line.  The only segment of the movie that was the least bit interesting and its a whisper you cant hear anyway.  Do not waste your time.  <BR>The fact that it is up for an award amazes me.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Let me first say I love great cinema, Peter Greenaway makes brilliant though slow moving cinematic ballets. Kieslowski's films are also rather slow moving, as are most European cinema YET they usually have something to say. THAT SAID, THIS FILM IS A PILE OF DUNG! Horrible, boring, no script at all, pointless, total purposeless, unfunny, uninteresting DUNG! As if Sophia's first film wasn't boring enough, she took out Kirsten Dunst and a handfull of teenage beauties and replaced them with Bill Murray (whom I usually love) and the fat lipped, creaky voiced, bare bummed, Johannson. HORRIBLE FILM, 2 hours of my life wasted never to return.
B00011RPB0|2.0|I recently saw &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; and found the movie to be rather boring to say the least. Bill Murray, who plays an over-the-hill actor, apparently is going thru a midlife crisis and travels to Tokyo, Japan to do some vodka commercials. While there he becomes bored staying in his hotel and happens to begin a friendship with a young lady (Scarlett Johannson) who is also bored in her hotel room. Her husband is a photographer and he leaves her everyday to be left alone. Granted the two are lonely, but in a huge city like Tokyo? I'd be busy shopping than anything else (certainly my wife would), I doubt anyone could be bored living in a city so full of excitement. Murray's acting is just so so, I'm used to seeing him in funny films, and Johannson's acting skills are, well limited. The dialog in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is terrible. Quite frankly I've read some of the five star reviews for this film and I just can't see what was so great about the film. I'm giving the film a two star review for it's shots of Japan.
B00005JME0|5.0|I just saw it over the weekend & it was 1 of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.  Definately worth seeing & buying when its available.
B00001OH7O|1.0|If you already have Bowie's &quot;Best Of&quot; double-album, then you already have the only 3 good songs from this album (&quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;Oh, You Pretty Things&quot;, and &quot;Life on Mars&quot;). The rest of this album is incredibly vapid and uninspired; I feel kinda like I bought an art book because there was some Dali in it, and the rest of the art turned out to be Thomas Kincaid.<br />If you don't already have Bowie's &quot;Best Of&quot;, then you need to get it RIGHT NOW.
B0000B0WVQ|4.0|Eletrelane are four girls from Brighton, England. These four girls may also be the, `the next big thing' in music. Their debut album, `Rock It to the Moon' created a buzz in the indie rock world. However, their new album, `The Power Out' may turn that buzz into a boom.<BR> The first track, `Gone Under Sea' is a mellow, glistening song that is sung entirely in French. This song is quiet, but speaks volumes with lead singer Verity Susman's vocals; one minute they are sweet and soothing the next they are angry and rebellious. The rhythm of, `Gone Under Sea' and Verity's excellent vocals create a resonating melody.<BR> `Oh Sombra!'(Oh Shadow!) is another foreign track. This time the language of choice is Spanish. `Oh Sombra!' is a very lively and has somewhat of a punk swagger. The guitars chug along while Verity rants like Courtney Love in Hole's punk heyday. <BR> On `Take the Bit between your Teeth' Electrelane shows us that they can rock out as well as Black Sabbath can. Once again Verity's electrifying voice is focal point. She ranges from Patti Smith to Iggy Pop. This song even has a roaring guitar solo followed up by orgasmic yelps that really sex-up this metal/pop song. <BR> Electrelane switches things up a bit with; `Birds' this somber song is all about getting over the lost of someone. `Birds' starts of somewhat depressive, (I want to see you, more than anything) but ends with a fierce bang, (it's not that I can't go on without you/busy, busy all the time) once again the band is taking advantage of the quiet/loud dynamic. At the end they tie it all together when Verity sweetly sings, (but I can't stop thinking about you.) This quiet two-minute song is one the shining moments of the album.<BR> So far so good, right? Well, not exactly. Electrelane loose their way on, `The Valleys' and decide to take a more pious route. This song is a Siegfried Sasson poem that has been arranged for a Chicago choir. While it is, no doubt, an impressive song, this track breaks up the melody of the album. Electrelane was a little too artistic in this song.  `The Power Out' was very a very cohesive album until this point. <BR> `Love Builds Up', `Only One Thing is Needed' and ` You Make Me Weak at the Knees' are a return to, `Rock It to the Moon's' all instrumental sound. In several of these tracks Verity no longer uses her voice as an instrument. She turns to her keyboards, giving these songs a new wave strut. These songs work well together, as well as with the album. They create a stellar end to, `The Power Out'.<BR> The band has grown tremendously since their debut album, but they have a little more growing to do. `The Power Out' is a polished gem of tangible feeling, but it is sometimes devoid in communication. While `The Power Out' may be louder than a buzz it's not quite a boom.
B00004Z459|1.0|jebus, this band just plain sux... <BR>Why you ask? well let me tell you, they try to rock and do horribly at with their simple powerchords any half-wit can do. The guitar player should take lessons from Dave Mustaine...or Kirk Hammet...If you want good metal, listen to ANY 80's or 70's metal band(Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Anthrax, the list goes on) and I assure you their musicianship skills way surpass Linkin' Park.<BR>And second of all, their rapper dude sucks even worse. Personally, i don't like rap, but I know what good rap is suppose to sound like. Rule of thumb- DJ's DONT GO WITH ELECTRIC GUITARS. GOD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING TRYING TO MIX THIS GARBAGE.<BR>If you want good rap, listen to Tupac or Old Snoop Dogg , and you'll find better rap than this crud. NOW GO BUY OTHER GOOD MUSIC ON THIS SITE! =D
B00007LTIA|5.0|I grew tired of this album years ago......saw YES do the &quot;Tales&quot; tour and liked that. Anyway 30 years later, remastered and its a gem! Better than almost anything anyone is doing today.....Amazing stuff....highly recommended........get comfortable and relax with this one.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade's voice should be in the dictionary as a definition of sultry.  When she sings in the style she does best she is absolutely phenomenal.  Her voice is the ultimate in romantic music and is suitable for darkened restaurants, living rooms (a fireplace would be good) and even bedrooms.  Her music can make you feel mellow and cozy and is great music to fall into the eyes of your significant other.<br />At least one other reviewer has commented that Sade is a one-trick pony because her vocal talent is generally limited to one style.  On the flip side, she sings best when she sings in the style that is her trademark.  As an example, in the song \\"Nothing Can Come Between Us\\" Sade tries a bit faster pace and a different style, and the music overruns her vocals.  I listen to Sade's music to listen to her, and when the instruments become the primary voice in a song then I feel as though I am not listening to Sade.  This particular song is also very derivative and somewhat lackluster as compared to most of her other songs.<br />Sade's voice is well exploited and at its best in songs such as \\"Smooth Operator,\\" \\"The Sweetest Taboo,\\" and the emotional, heartfelt \\"Jezebel.\\"  But the examples on this CD are numerous extend well beyond these songs.  \\"No Ordinary Love\\" is powerful, Sade sings from some deep place inside of her that connects you to her soul.  This song is more than seven minutes of passion and beauty.  Try listening to this song in a completely dark room, preferably holding your significant other, and keeping your eyes closed.  The power of this song will flow through you and give you a most amazing feeling.<br />There are so many other wonderful songs on this CD that I could easily extol the virtues of nearly all of them.  \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\" is a wonderful blues song that is so sad and longing that it threatens to wrest tears from your eyes if you listen to it too long.  \\"Pearls\\" is just that, a jewel of a song to cap off this collection.  Once again Sade brings so much emotion to this song, perhaps the most emotion of any song in this collection.  Dive deep into this song, it is worth it.<br />Sade is difficult to categorize, because she brings so many influences to her music.  Some have classified her music as Jazz, and some of her music is Jazz-influenced.  In some places she shows up as soft rock or easy listening, and both would be at least partially correct.  However, in the end what matters is the music; classifications are merely a way of organizing, and we know that art sometimes defies organization because it goes where it will.n Sade brings so much emotion to this song, perhaps the most emotion of any song in this collection.

B00007LTIB|5.0|Yep, this is it - as good as it gets!! Steve Howe is amazing on that Telecaster and both Alan White &amp; Chris Squire reach new career peaks-whatever they may have struggled to achieve early in the bands career, the got it down here. &quot;Tales&quot; as amazing as that is really only hinted at what they could do .This would have confirmed it, but exceeded it in every way. The band plays with meter and keys like they were childrens toys. I saw the Relayer tour twice and was in awe that they could pull this stuff off LIVE (and they still can-they added &quot;Gates of Delerium&quot; to last years tour! The extra tracks are a waste but who cares. Buy this one #@*^&amp; !
B0000W3YIS|5.0|Umm... whoever said Britney has no talent or has never sung outside of a studio really hasn't done their homework. By the way, In The Zone is awesome! Britney's singing and songwriting abilities have definitely matured on this album. She's not a fully-realized music artist yet, but she's definitely on the way and in the zone. Get In The Zone, literally!
B000002J1Y|4.0|Back when everyone was making these gigantic three album LIVE sets , YES had to do one too! (I guess) I saw them three times during the period that this album was recorded and I loved them LIVE - but Yessongs doesn't hold up well for me all these years later (nor the movie of the same name). However there ARE some standouts.........&quot;Starship Trooper&quot; I feel that this is the definitive version. &quot;And you and I&quot; &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; &quot;Seen all good People&quot; &quot;Yours is no Disgrace&quot; all good stuff, good stuff really! Just more that I can handle. I can listen to all of &quot;Tales&quot; no problem, but this one gets old pretty fast. If you love YES and dont have it then I suppose you'll have to get it (like I did).
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is just to say that In The Zone is great! If you are a true fan of pop music, give this album a chance and you won't be sorry. <br />  To those of you who have been posting reviews simply because you have a personal issue with Britney Spears: PLEASE STOP! This is a forum for posting opinions about artists' music, not the artists personally. Also, even if you truly don't like the music, just trashing it with no real explanation is not helpful either. The bottom line: If you can't write at least a somewhat objective review, GO AWAY, you're wasting the time of people who want real opinions about the music. <br />  The album sounds a little weird at first, but if you give it a chance it will probably really grow on you - that's the way it was for me - I love this album. The more I continue buying CD's, the more I still like this the best of any music I've purchased in 2003-2004.<br />  One more thing: Please, people, don't compare In The Zone to Stripped. Britney and Christina are two very different artists, and I and others like both of them for different reasons. Christina has the wider, more diva-like range. Then there's Britney, who has a unique, girlish-yet-womanly voice that can be very pretty, even honey-Southern, warm and soulful (she's had her moments) - and she brings it closer than ever to its potential on In The Zone. Let the Britney/Christina thing rest; there's little point to it.<br />  Thanks for reading my second review. For my original, you'll have to go down a few dozen in the postings. Have a nice day!

Now along with all the extra tracks....any YES fan cant pass this up. No &quot;Relayer&quot; but still damn good.........
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is a very poor movie and Hollywood does itself a great dis-service by lauding it as anything else.
B00009Z576|1.0|Skip this one..........Its a YES album only because Roger Dean did the artwork........nearly unlistinable. I kind of like &quot;Man in a white car&quot; but the rest...................
B00005JMJ4|1.0|To the individual who wrote regarding the obvious &quot;ballot stuffing&quot; 5 star reviews by a single person here, I would ordinary think it is a joke, but the person (from Seattle) has written a pretty organized and diverse opinion for each post.  This leads me to believe that maybe it is not just some fanatic writing these but maybe someone interested in making sure this film does well on amazon..I wonder who that can be? One word of advice..if you are going to take the time to write numerous reviews, try at least changing your location once in a while (watch how we will now get a bunch of 5 star reviews from other locations lol)<br />By the way, I found the film very boring and encourage people to rent it before buying since you are very likely to be dissapointed..unless of course, if you watch movies to be depressed and bored.
B00007KWHP|4.0|This is the album that I first heard YES on and I LOVED it - I freaked out !! I even changed my name to Jon Anderson while in college - I saw the &quot;Fragile&quot; tour and met the band backstage. I have loved them ever since. &quot;Fragile&quot; however, I cant listen to anymore.......at first I thought it was because I had heard it too much the first time around..... But I still love &quot;Relayer&quot; and &quot;Tales&quot; and &quot;Going for the One&quot; and &quot;the YES album&quot; I just cant listen to &quot;South side of the sky&quot; and &quot;Roundabout&quot; and &quot;long Distance runaround&quot; and &quot; Moo for a day&quot; and &quot;the Fish&quot; anymore. If you have never heard this album and want to see what its all about -then spend your 10 bucks.....but if your replacing that old &quot;Fragile&quot; album and have some kind of nostalgia for it-buy a 12 pack instead.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|very interesting to see the &quot;fellow&quot; from seattle writing a dozen 5 star reviews.  Aside from seriously lacking a life, it is probably similiar to the ballot stuffing that got this garbage an Oscar nomination. Scary how a few fanatics can manipulate the process.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Yes, I know this movie is not supposed to be interpreted with the same lens in which we would view another movie.  However, any story should make a reasonable effort to move from scene A to scene B and still make some sense.  One can actually watch this entire movie and not come up with a single answer as to why things happen.  Why the lesbian scenes?  There was no point to it.  And was the acting bad on purpose?  Almost nothing was believable.<br />Consider the first scene -- where the girl is found in the bathroom, almost taking a shower, but not really.  What was the point of that?  And wouldn't the woman take the effort to call the police or at least listen to her aunt who says that she should get rid of this stranger in the room?  For some reason I think this movie was written at a coffee shop and the script writer must have thought this is the most creative artpiece that has been known to man, not knowing that almost no one will understand the flick.  I am all for making a movie rather creative and using nifty tricks to elevate your ideas, but this movie falls far short of that goal.<br />Perhaps this movie ought to be marketed as a film version of abstract art -- it is up to the audience, not the screen writer, to state what the film means.  It is relativism to the extreme.
B00007M5CO|5.0|Many readers interested in this composition would be advised to recall such groups as Bond and Opera Babes, that have tried to give classical music a new twist.  Admirable as their efforts were, neither was able to drag themselves from the classification of just being pretty girls with talent (sort of).  Bajofondo is everything they wanted to be.  Instead of plastering the cover of this ablum with a photo of themselves wearing sexy little outfits, bajofondo mearly has a close up photo of what appears to be women's crossed legs, clad in fishnets.  This alluringly naughty photo seems an apt description of the sound of \\"Tango Club\\".<br />It's a brilliant melting pot of some of the coolest types of music around.  Most people acknowledge any form or use of electronica as being an up to the moment sound, but what about the classic shiek and style of the tango?  Both are acknowledged in this wonderfully sultry mix.  every note is deliberate and important, tearing down musical walls other artist's only dreamed of conquering.  Bajofondo is essential to every musical collection.
B0000DCGT3|1.0|If a screen writer intended to make a movie that was disgusting, not funny, focused on the lowest and basest instincts to such an extent that it would be even less interesting than a raunchy ... movie, this would be the movie that was created.<br />First, why is it necessary to end this series even more revolting than it started?  When the series began, it certainly was sexually-explicit, but it was by no means close to obscene.<br />Also, every scene was highly predictable.  All I had to do was think: \\"What is the easiest thing for a screen writer to create,\\" and before my brain could process a result, I saw it on the screen.  Certainly we, the movie-going audience expect to be somewhat entertained by substantive dialogue and an actual script.  It is unfortunate that this movie fails on all counts.
6304082428|5.0|Please allow me to thank you profusely for producing the finest, most perfect, most beautiful movie series ever made.  I've watched the vhs series with my wife about 25 times over the years.<br /><br />Here is a respectful request.  Could you release even another DVD version?  This time it would be great if the gorgeous cinematography from the VHS series could be used.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|You will keep watching and watching and waiting and waiting...then nothing happens!!!! This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I just kept waiting for something to happen...anything, but nothing ever did. What a waste of my time. Don't bother renting or buying this movie, you would have a more enjoyable time watching a blank screen.
0156027321|4.0|Having been told this novel is an adventure story, my disappointment began to crest as I read the first portion of the book. I was bored by the personal opinions of theological and zoological matters, and could not envision a scenario in which they would become relevant to the plot. As I continued through the book, however, I became drawn in to the story of shipwrecked Pi Patel and his tiger companion. The book read extremely quickly, and was gruesome, touching, intelligent and imaginitive all at once. After a somewhat tedious opening set of chapters, the book ultimately redeems itself with an original and inventive story.
B000062YAZ|1.0|This is a classic album please lololol. I listen to a variety of music from Soul,Funk to Punk, Nu Wave and Thrash and the dreaded Disco, but I laughed my head off  on this album the only thing scary when my friend played this album for me was  when the dogs would stop howling.The only cut worth listening to on this so-called \\"masterpiece\\" (as if talking about satan, nercophillia and murder is such a big thrill)was \\"raining blood\\". The musicianship and lyrics are poor and the singing is even worse. If anybody is blown away by this so-called band listen to Megadeth, Bad Brains or early Metallica. I gave it one star for the comicial lyrics and the album cover is interesting It must be a white suburban thing becuase I don't understand.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I have owned my first LOTR Soundtrack (FOTR) at the first January of 2002. It was amazing!!! It was the beautiful music, I've ever heard. It was part of Great LOTR symphony,( as I call it myself). I STRONGLY recommend this CD to all J.R.R.Tolkien fans, and others who enjoy LOTR. I have now collection of all 3 leather soundtracks. Wow! It's really GREAT!!!!
0440237688|5.0|The Giver<br /> This novel written by Louis Lowry, shows how people could live, if they didn't have their individual characteristics as people.  This book tells us of a world where no one has color, no one raises their own children and no one has anything special about them except the Giver.  The Giver is the one being that holds all the wonderful and happy thought outside of this community.  But he also holds the reality of the so-called \\"REAL WORLD\\".  This is a great book, it demonstrates how our world would be if we didn't not have freedom to express ourselves.  Jonah Breaks this ongoing circle by running away, and not choosing to accept his new position as the giver.  <BR> This novel contains Irony in a way that it does not tell you the exact meaning, but you have to attempt to translate it yourself.  It gives you the hard evidence but in the book you have to think and explore your imagination to get the full meaning.    The Theme of this book is to look outside of the box.  Don't judge people for being themselves or for being unique, because without that what is the world other then nothingness.  <BR> The Tone of this book is sad but in a way you can rejoice about the way Jonah starts to think.  There are many different times in the book when Jonah is confused and doesn't know what to do but he always makes it through until his death.  Even in his death he finds a peace though.  He learns a lesson and teaches one as well.<BR> I would recommend this book to anyone that feels that they don't fit along with everyone else.  It might change the way you think of your self and the confidence you have for yourself.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|My name is TEDDY i am from NC and this cd could not get any better than what it is cuz it is the best!!! i cant wait till the next CD comes out!!! (hurry it up!!!!) i wish i was in their band!!!!1
B0000CD5FN|4.0|This is a real good disc, not something thrown together for a cash-in opportunity.  Although I really don't think the world needs another version of Redemption Song, every other track is top-notch.  Suprisingly poppy in places, the Strummer of 79 is also evident on this disc.  His voice sounds great and the rock tracks have a real edge.  Only complaint: disc is a little short (guess that couldn't be helped :-(  )
B00003CX5P|3.0|Episode One of the STAR WARS saga is actually a very entertaining film that does not deserve the bad rap it has taken since its initial release.  The plot, while confusing to some, is actually rather interesting and raises many question along the way that will be answered in upcoming installments.  George Lucas, who wrote and produced the saga, sets up many starting points for the following five films, laying the groundwork so to speak.  The only mistake being made here is that he relies too much on the viewers prior knowledge of later episodes in the saga, not considering that they will one day be viewed by future audiences in chronological order.  This actually begs the question, should the films be watched in their proper order or not??? <br />Yes, the film does have some weaknesses, but it also has several strengths.  Sadly, many 'fans' ignore the strengths all together.   Liam Neeson is very good in the role of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn.  He is just as I have always envisioned the Jedi to be like in the days of the Republic.  It is obvious though that Director Lucas didn't know how to utilize Liam's extensive acting abilities for maximum effect, leading to some of his performance being a bit stagnant when it should have been heart felt.  I still enjoy his performance, but it could have been so much more!<br />Ewan McGregor was an excellent choice to play the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He manages to do a wonderful interpretation of the late Alec Guiness, who originated the role in Episode Four (the original film), and really makes you believe that he is the younger version of the character.  Oddly enough, the choice was made by Director Lucas to cast Kenobi as a secondary character to Qui-Gon.  This relegates a character, whom many believe should have been the main character, to the sidelines throughout much of the film.  Regardless of this fact, Ewan still manages to give a fantastic performance.<br />Queen Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, is presented quite well on screen.  She properly exhibits and maintains the regality  needed for the role.  As Padme, however, she fails to deliver.  This is where the actual characterization existed in the script, but Natalie doesn't waste any time with it.  Every time there is need for actual emotion from Padme, she seems to just read her lines.  The scene in which she reveals her true identity to the Gungans and begs for their help is blandly delivered with disastrous results!  I like Natalie Portman and think that she is a good actress, but I will never understand why she couldn't put forth some type of effort in this pivotal role.<br />Young Anakin Skywalker, the central figure of not only this film but the whole saga, is  portrayed this time around in a most under whelming manner by Jake Lloyd.  There are three factors that contribute to the failure of his performance.  First, the character of Anakin was given some rather badly written dialogue that the best of actors would have trouble dealing with.  Secondly, dealing with a child actor sometimes requires the director to actually work more closely with them in order to get a suitable performance out of them, which I get the feeling George Lucas doesn't bother to do.  Thirdly, I don't think that little Jake was really up to the role from the beginning.  Yes, he may be a cute kid and all, but cute doesn't cut it when you are the central character of the film!    <br />JarJar Binks, a much maligned and hated character portrayed by Ahmed Best, is the main reason for so much hatred being heaped against this film.  Though his character is outlandish and irritating to an extent, he also has several truly humorous sequences that tend to be forgotten or ignored.  He is not as detrimental to the film as many make out.  Basically, if you dropped the more cartoonishly portrayed elements of him, and cut back on the scenes of his cowardly, bumbling behavior during the land battle, he would be much more likable.<br />The action scenes are mostly well done here, with two sequences that steal the show.  The pod race midways through the film is a very exciting experience filled with lots of edge of your seat thrills. That, and the light saber battle during the finale between the two Jedi and the villainous Darth Maul which is also very exciting.  It is one of the most beautifully choreographed sequences done for the saga yet.  The land battle with the battle droids and Gungans is pretty good, but suffers a bit from JarJar antics and excessive CGI.  Too bad the space battle during the finale didn't get as much attention as the other showdowns did.  From script to screen, it suffered the most with silly accidental scenarios that ultimately win the day for the good guys.<br />Some of the deleted scenes available on this DVD release have been re-inserted into the  film, including elements from the Pod Race Grid Sequence, Pod Race Second Lap, and the entire Coruscant Taxi Trip.  These are good inclusion to the film, helping to tie certain scenes together a bit better.  I would like to have seen the Waterfall Sequence and Farewell To Jira put back into the film, but those will have to remain as extra features.  The other scenes are of little importance and better left on the cutting room floor.<br /> In the end, THE PHANTOM MENACE is a good film.  It captures the spirit of adventure that makes these films fun, though it crosses troubled waters from time to time.  It isn't perfect by a long shot, but it is still a credible entry that is much better than people want to make it out to be.  Three years later Episode Two would improve on many, but not all, of the problems encountered here.   In the mean time, beware of the excessively critical 'fans' and their vitriolic comments!  3 ½ Stars!
B00006RU5B|1.0|I don't care who these guys played with... They were with good bands in the past, this one is awful. Find some new ideas, Chris and Tom. In the mean time, you can take this entire album and cram it far up. There is not ONE good track or redeeming quality here. If I could give it minus five stars I would.
0738206679|5.0|I liked it. I read, but I rarely finish a book. I finished this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|You know its funny how every time a good band emerges with quality music that DOESNT sound like it was recorded in the cheapest backstreet studio that can be found (because the band DIDNT blow all their money on nose candy), someone makes that their main complaint. Heres an idea for you fried freaks who confuse music with crapout distortion; stop throughing around words like &quot;overproduced&quot; , &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;commercialized&quot;, and enjoy the fact the cutting edge technology not only exists, but plays a long overdue role in the creation of music today.<BR>Here's another thought that anyone can find useful; buy music because you like it, not because MTV says that you should, or because it gets plenty of airplay.<BR>And now my main point. This is truly an alternative album, with Amy's haunting/heavenly vocals featured throughout. That alone projects this CD way beyond today's standard fare. The production is tasteful, and never overshadows the music. The hit single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is only the beginning. The rest of the album is actually quite deeper but for the most part still retains the heavier edge.The exception is &quot;My Immortal&quot;, which is so beautifully mellow, that this must be what heaven sounds like. I am completely pleased.
B000001BZT|4.0|Of the albums Earle put out before he spent time in jail and cleaned up his act, this is the best.  The band sounds good and the collection of songs is first rate.  The title track is one of Earle's best.  He also does a version of his song, The Devil's Right Hand, which is another of his best.  The Cheiftains make an appearance.  <br />I happen to like his post-arrest albums better.  Earle, unlike many other artists, actually became a better song writer after he became sober and his albums of the mid-ninties to the present are, almost without exception, excellent and Copperhead Road is the closest he came before that time.
B0000B0WVQ|5.0|Not only they have a hard time sticking to one language in their lyrics, they sure can't see their listeners stay calm and content listening to one tune. A rollercoaster would be a ferry ride compared to the adventures they convey through this album. There is not a single moment of imitation in the whole album, yet one could find a little bit of everything in so many tracks. There is a probably little bit of Radiohead, a little bit of Doors, a light taste of Cardigans and a few drops of Cranberries lying around.
B000000WF0|5.0|Let me start by saying that this is my favorite album, ever. It has spent more time getting played than any other album I have, even my own mix albums.<BR>But, it took me a good long while for it to get there. For the first year I had it, the only song I could stomach was &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot;, and it's still my favorite. From there, I got used to each song until I like just about every one on here.<BR>Most of the songs have a sad, hopeless overtone. Yet at the same time it feels like there is a haunting feeling of infinity, like things never end.<BR>Aside from that, the songs are interestingly crafted, usually with a beat that's quite a bit faster than Ashcroft's soulful singing.<BR>A few stand out to me: &quot;Rolling People&quot; (which has since become one of my fav driving songs) and &quot;Come on&quot; are as hardcore as the bend gets (not very) and that suits me just fine. I have Linkin Park and Godsmack for that. &quot;One day&quot; was the song that described exactly how I felt after a difficult relationship, and when asked to describe how I felt, I simply played that song. &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; is an interesting mix of sounds that almost create a surreal vision for me. And, &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; was my anthem for &quot;the Hobbit&quot; and &quot;the Lord of the Rings&quot; when I read them many, many years back.<BR>If you can take the time to get used to the unusual sound, there's a lot of emotion and wonderful juxtaposing here. HIGHLY recommended.
B000002KNY|5.0|Simply put, this album is a masterpiece. An oustanding study in duality. A beautiful example of how a simultaneous desire to acheive simplicity &amp; complexity can result in a (an?) harmonious end-product. There is no struggle for consistency of vision as there is on &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; or the brilliantly eclectic &quot;Fear of Music.&quot; This one falls under the near-perfect (regarding concept) category with &quot;Little Creatures&quot; and &quot;Naked.&quot;<BR>Essential for those who think REM are the pioneers of thinking person's alternative rock.
1556154844|4.0|I am not jet finished reading this book, so maybe later I shall have some additional comments. The book is very old (copyright 1993), but it is valuable asset for professional programmer. <BR>This book is the best example of the rule &quot;the more you know the better is your benefit of reading a book&quot;. For example, although book does not deal with object oriented programming (as far as I read till now), even if you are professinal programmer who is in object programming you will get something that you very probably missed - a lot of important and fine details that will help you be a better programmer in object world. It is very hard to explain the profit you get with this book, but it is: you get your knowledge of coding polished to the maximum. <BR>To return to the example of OOP (object oriented programming) this book will tell you about the cohesion of your methods (the book calls them traditional names, routines) and sorts of coupling; everything is the pure ground for OOP but from the perspective of traditional programming; even in OOP books you cannot find easily such explanations, and that done in traditional programming. <BR>If you are a beginner, this book will show you how to name the routines and variables, will show you that statistically short routines of say 20 lines are more prone to errors per line of code than routines of 100 lines! Anyway, I do not want to spoil the pleasure of reading the book: don't expect too much from it, but if you are a brilliant programmer who appreciate precision and polishing of your knowledge, you will be on a right track if you choose this book.
B00005JME0|5.0|Ok, I have to admit.....when I first saw that Ashton Kutcher would be taking on a serious role, I was very skeptical. I mean let's face it, the guy's a regular class clown. He's very humerous and hardly ever has anything but a smile across his face. But after seeing this movie, I am convinced that Kutcher has definetely established himself as a respected actor. His performance in this movie sent chills up my spine. This movie has it all: love, violence, humor, twist and turns, and it'll defientely make you jump more than once. The cast of characters was done well and I was impressed with the overall story. Amy Smart and Kutcher were the perfect on screen duo and made the story believeable. In my opinion, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a few years. I highly recommend it, but pay attention because it does have a complicated story line that'll leave you guessing until the end. I give it a 10/10 My only complaint was the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending was amazing. It fit the movie extremely well, but it was a little on the depressing side. I mean he does all that and doesn't get the girl? Heartbreak central, but at least there's finally a movie without a happy ending for once.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|Its Loud and in your face and when i first listned to it i was so pumped up...Pick it up today
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The other reviewers of this film who say it was dull and boring quite obviously missed the point.  This is a great film about not quite fitting in (being \\"lost\\" if you will) but above all, it is about a great, if only too brief, friendship.  Most movies, whenever featuring a man/woman relationship, make it something hot and steamy.  I love this film because it is about two people who make each other happy by just being together and not in a sexual way.  This movie isn't for everyone, but if you are in the mood for a laid-back and sweet movie, I would strongly recommend \\"Lost in Translation.\\"
B0000AQVCL|3.0|After a decade of music that seemed to be nothing more than filler for a dark void (with exceptions, of course), the troops come marching in - The Strokes and the rest of the so-called 'Rock Revival' bands.  The science of their sounds is this: musicians that grew up with 90s music and apply it to the classic rock of the 60s and 70s.<br />While most of these bands try to be original, the latest entry in the arena, Jet, is happy with the fact that when you listen to their album \\"Get Born\\", it will instantly remind you of classic bands like the 'Stones.  They admit this and claim they're just out to make some good rock tunes in homage of the masters.  And they succeed.  Their catchy, stripped-down, hard-rocking tracks will definitely keep you interested, and they even throw in some slow ballads like the Oasis-esque \\"Look What You've Done\\".  Don't look for any deep meaning in the lyrics, and don't listen to the whole album in one sitting - you'll find it gets pretty repetitive.  All in all, Jet is a band that fits in perfectly with the new era of rock, and their potential for the future is undeniable.  \\"Get Born\\" is a must-have for revival enthusiasts and rock fans in general.  I couldn't really find a message in this album when I first listened, but now I hear it loud and clear - rock is NOT dead and it's here to stay.
B000003TA4|4.0|ok first let me start off by saying pearl jam SUCKS!!! they will never be up to par with nirvana pearl jam is the worst thing to happen to music. this album is awesome on only give it 4 because it was worshiped by so many kids which is what kurt hated. its too poppy. people say this is the best grunge album are wrong. that is definently in utero. but thats another story&quot;teen sirit would have been a good song if it didnt get played so much but you cant beat the intro when the drums kick in.&quot;breed&quot; and&quot;territorial pissings&quot; are what nirvana really was all about. if you liked those 2 songs you will love &quot;in utero&quot; i suggest you go out and buy them both
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I love this cd, its so much fun! Every song on it is awesome except for 3.  Staring at the sun is boring and gets old, the end of line makes me cry and pay the man is just bad. The best track is shes got issues cause i can relate to it =)
B000002U82|5.0|In my opinion, this is the BEST Pink Floyd album ever made.  I consider Pink Floyd my favorite band, and although they have a sleuth of GREAT albums, this album delivers a punch that much harder than any of their other work.  To me, music is perfection when it reaches the an ultimate climax in mood sound, as well as vocals.  There is no flaw within this album.  From start to finish you experience the cool vibe that Gilmour as well as the rest of the band were on WHEN PIECED TOGETHER.  This is ultimately Roger Water's masterpiece, but he could not have done it with out the enourmously talented Gilmour, Wright, Mason.  Dark Side of the Moon is the place to start if you're interested in Floyd at all.  Then pick up Wish You were Here, Animals, and the Wall.  Oh yeah, and their early stuff is good too..........
1573229725|5.0|This book is a true treasure. I feel like I made such a great discovery that day I found it on display in a book store. Ms. Waters' writing is gripping and compelling, and her story telling ability is top notch. While the book partly involves a relationship between two women, it is not central to most of the story and the book should appeal to a broad range of readers.<br />Fingersmith has some dark and gothic overtones, which makes it all the more flavorful of a read. The absolute best thing about this book, however, are the plot twists and turns. There are at least two points in the book where you simply don't see what's coming. I can't remember having ever been that surprised by a writer and I loved it.<br />If you enjoy books with historical settings, devious plot turns, wonderful writing, and/or unusual characters, then don't pass this one up!<br />(Note: Tipping the Velvet is also an excellent read. The other book I've read of hers, Affinity, is only for those who don't mind a dark story with no light to brighten it. It's very well written like the others and has some interesting plot turns, but left me feeling like a bit of a masochist at the end for reading it.)
B00006BTCA|4.0|Well, I've know this band for over a year, and I've got to tell you I never get tired of listening to this cd. Now I do have to confess that this music isn't for everyone, especially if your into whats popular, this isn't for you, but if you are curious, try this! Now this is that music that relax's you with the rythmic, hypnotic music and give you energy at the same time, not sure how, but it does! If you like this your going to like The Stills, and Broken Social Scene! Have fun..
B00008H2LB|5.0|Don't look at those bad reviews.  It's pretty obvious that the reason there all about two sentenses and all right next to each other is that they were all written by the same person who has no better way to spend 3 hrs.
B00005JLXE|5.0|we really need a director's cut of this thing, but based on just what we got here we got ourselves a damn good time. jen is hot, ben is a zillion times better than he coulda been, bullseye and kingpin are two of the best villians in the history of comic movies, blood and grit, plus lots and lots of camp. what a combo. incoherent yes, but fun from start to finish.
B00006G8HX|4.0|If you're hoping for extra footage, well forget it.  What you do get is another excellent transfer, sound, and commentaries, although Leonard Nimoy should've brought a buddy to talk with.  He's pretty boring to listen to.<br />There are plently of extras to keep you from missing the extra footage the previous DVDs included.  <br />Well worth it.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Christmas Vacation has more humorous scenes than any movie short of Airplane and Naked Gun and it's funnier than either of those two movies.  As I sit here in February, I can't remember a single scene from Christmas Vacation that wasn't funny, most of them are cracking-up funny. <br />I've laughed at scenes in only two other movies in my life so hard that it brought tears - the &quot;We're not moving!&quot; scene from The Sure Thing, and the bathroom scene from The Cable Guy.  This movie has at least four scenes that genuinely, literally had me out of breath, tears rolling down my face and chest aching from laughing so hard - the attic scene, the main catastrophy scene with Todd and Margo next door, the Aunt Bethany scene (both her gift and her jello) and the squirrel catching scene.  The Christmas lights, lingerie shopping, sledding and final scenes are close behind.<br />Chevy Chase is a comic genious (at least in Christmas Vacation - he's been in plenty of movies with inferior writing, too many, sad to say).  No other comedic actor - including such greats as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel &amp; Hardy or the Marx brothers - comes close to being as funny as Chase is with physical comedy.<br />I've seen two sorts of non-positive reviews for this movie.  The first sort comes from people who found this movie too lowbrow for them.  It's not sophisticated or dry humor like This is Spinal Tap or Best in Show (both among my favorites, incidentally), nor is it cutesy humor, such in a Hugh Grant romantic comedy.  Christmas Lampoon is flat-out, ridiculous humor.  It is so poignantly ludicrous, absurd, childish and downright silly that it is hilarious.  A lot of other silly humor - Adam Sandler and David Spade movies come to mind - has nowhere near the level of clear focus on the ridiculous and that explains why Christmas Vacation is so funny.<br />The second group of people are complaining about the &quot;Special Edition&quot; additions to the DVD.  Some are explaining that their low ratings are on the DVD, not the movie, and that is fair, while others seem to think that the movie itself is of secondary importance to the special features on the DVD.  Now I've not seen the Special Edition (I just jumped to the first result from an Amazon search of &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;), but what most people are complaining about is the voice-over commentary on the SE DVD.  I've probably listened to the commentary on maybe four DVD's out of the hundred or so I've rented or bought, and I really cannot understand how that one feature could make or break the movie so significantly.  In my opinion, the commentary, whether it is the best or the worst ever made, can only effect the overall ratings by maybe one star at the most. <br />Oh, between the laughs, the movie also has a nice Christmas theme of treating everyone well and being generous during the holidays.<br />In summary, if you can't crack at least a few smiles watching Christmas Vacation, have the paramedics bring the electric paddles, because you have no pulse.
B0000683DH|5.0|The only problem I have with this DVD was the amount of material on this and future &quot;Special Edition&quot; Star Trek DVDs.  After seeing how much they crammed onto the first picture, maybe they should have released ST 2 thru 6 first, then finally TMP.  It wouldn't have seemed like such a letdown.  And after just getting the sixth movie, it seems like Paramount is running out of bonus material.  Maybe they should dig out that soundbyte of Bill Shatner's Strawberry Fields forever.<br />Great transfer, the picture is crisp and the sound is full.  I remember this movie when it first aired on TV.  That's the VHS version I've been watching all these years!!!  It looks like other people agree about the picture/sound quality.  Well worth it.<br />This is Ricardo's best performance, ever.  Star Trek fan or not.
B000005IRG|3.0|This CD is difficult to review.  For one thing, its reputation precedes it. It is universally hailed as one of the greatest albums ever recorded, so that might predispose the listener to read greatness into it.  For another, it is difficult to classify.  It has its moments of catchy songcraft, but it is certainly not pop.  And it is NOT punk, neither in sound nor in attitude.  (At best, it is punk by association: Richard Hell was an early member, Malcolm McLaren offered to manage them, they played at CBGBs, the LP was released in 1977, Tom Verlaine wrote and recorded with Patti Smith, etc.).  The whole of Marquee Moon generally does not follow any sort of obvious conventional structure, and it is more easily contrasted with than compared to other CDs of its era.  Finally, there is nothing obviously terrible about the CD, nor anything obviously and consistently great (except for the guitar work).  So the album is very much a one-of-a-kind affair, and might be described as a warped sort of post punk or new wave.  It is thoroughly unconventional without being particularly radical (although that may be a radical achievement in itself).  However, uniqueness does not entail greatness, and in the case of Marquee Moon, the uniqueness is much more apparent than the greatness.<br /><br />So what is it that is so great about this CD?  Well, it is impossible to not be impressed by the inspired and majestic guitar work.  Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine trade off of each other with intuitive artistic ease.  They might be accused of showing off because it sounds so good, but this is one of the least pretentious guitar showcases that I have ever heard.  It is virtuosic, but in a professional, unflashy way.  One cannot help but feel that beauty and grace with the instrument just comes naturally to them.  Snotty and snarling riffs, ringing arpeggios, bright cascading scales, and wild and crazy solos adorn every song on the CD.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the guitar work is the best part of every song, and the other components suffer a bit at its expense.  Tom Verlaine's voice is not great, but it is at least nicely off beat and it suits the material well enough.  But the lyrics are often a bit too obscure, and one must not mistake obscurity for profundity (which is largely lacking on this record).  Verlaine may have been a poet, but he wasn't a great one.  Moreover, the emotion of each song seems a bit calculated, which may be, in part, a downside of the naturally good guitar playing.  (Still, the lyrics to \\"Venus\\", \\"Guiding Light,\\" and \\"Torn Curtain\\" are quite beautiful.  And the title track is stunning.)<br /><br />All of that said, however, I would certainly not discourage anyone from at least listening to this CD.  Its uniqueness is itself refreshing and rewarding to the patient listener.  Moreover, the weight of its reputation is lifted by repeated listenings, and once that happens, the listener is able to hear it for what is it: a  fine, ambitious, and largely unpretentious record.  Some of the songs are better than others, but none of them sound out of place. The CD plays very well as a whole, and should be listened to in a single sitting.  And the influence of the album's NYC cool is plain to see in bands like The Strokes and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.  BUT STILL, Marquee Moon's greatest asset is its uniqueness, and while that may not translate to an equal level of greatness, it still proves the validity of the effort.  And enough people have heard something all-around spectacular in this record, and it is worth taking the chance that you may be one of them.<br /><br />(One last thing:  There have been tests done in which each participant is shown three lines of obviously different lengths.  S/he is asked to pick the longest one.  When s/he picks the obviously longest one, s/he is told that most people picked a different one.  Then s/he is asked if s/he wants to change his/her mind.  Many participants do.  What's my point? This: if I were to call this CD \\"punk,\\" I would feel like one of the people in the study who changed his mind, i.e., like someone who said something he knew to be false just because everyone else did.)l this CD \\"punk,\\" I would feel like one of the people in the study who changed his mind, i.e., like someone who said something he knew to be false just because everyone else did.)
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is the best &quot;Director's Cut&quot; DVD that I own.  There's more crap on here than I know what to do with!!!  Plus the movie's cut is extremely well done.  The greatness that is Robert Wise.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Usually I like rap singles, and when i buy the cd its all the same. Not with KanYe's cd. This is one of the best rap cds ive heard in a long time. Family Business is a standout track. GO BUY THIS CD!!!

B00004STUL|4.0|When the movie first came out in 1995 I was only 5 years old and didn't really care about it. But as I got older I saw the trailers and commercials for Bad Boys II and I had to admit, although it was R, I was interested. It starts off with two cops; family man Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) and the ladies man Mike Lowry (Will Smith),  driving on the Miami streets. After a very successful heroin drug bust (worth one hundred million) they feel pretty good about themselves. That is, until they find all their evidence has disapeered. As the story goes on the only witness to a crime linked directly with the heist they're working to break will only speak with the cop named Mike Lowry, which, at the moment is not around. What's a best friend/partner to do? Pretend to be his friend of course! The plot can be easily guessed for the most part and there is heavy violence and language but nonetheless I found myself laughing (especially the minimart scene, you'll see) and forgetting all about the predictable plot and cliches. If you can easily ignore the strong profanity use or love it then this movie is for you.
B000083C49|5.0|Paramount has done it again with this excellent transfer, although the sound isn't much better.  This set is loaded with stuff, almost as much as the first.<br />The commentary between Shatner and Nimoy is quite enjoyable and makes it worth the price of the DVD alone.<br />Well worth it.

B0000UJL96|4.0|I bought this to complete my set of the Special Edition DVDs.  At first, I was a little bummed at the lack of any kind of booklet or documentation or the upside down Enterprise on the Disc 2 label.<br />Then I watched the movie with the audio &amp; text commentaries on.  Great picture, pretty entertaining commentaries, although not as informative as TMP or TWOK.<br />The other extras sealed the deal.  Next to TMP, this is the 2nd best of the lot.  And the booklets they've been putting in these have gone downhill since the first one, it was just a matter of time.  I hear they're releasing Generations without a case.

B00005JM0B|2.0|Can anyone tell me the difference between this movie and Matrix Reloaded?  Both were movies that needed to be thought out a lot more before producing.  After seeing T3, I'm left wondering this:<br />Ok, the first termintor couldn't do it (T1), so they sent a more powerful one (T2) that couldn't do it.  Now they're sending an even more powerful (T3) terminator that still can't do it.<br />Let's just skip onto say T19, the baddest momma out.  I mean, these things are from the future, right?  How come they keep sending \\"last year's\\" model?  Or is George Bush V running skynet?<br />And how come these \\"future\\" terminators had such a problem with the terminators of the day?<br />Maybe I'd buy into Jason vs Terminator, but I doubt it.  C'mon Arnold, give us something fresh.  You produced this trash.<br />And do we really need to see his butt anymore?  I was hoping we'd get a better look at the other terminator, right???
1576751988|5.0|I've had this frog sitting on my nightstand for several weeks now.  It wasn't a particularly gross looking frog, it's just that I had too many other frogs that I needed to eat.  Well, I finally sat down and ate it up...and enjoyed every minute of it!  Yum!   I now know that I will be eating many more frogs, even the really disgusting ones.  I know how to sort them out so that I don't have to overeat, or eat the wrong ones first. (Can't have dessert before the main course!)  I would recommend eating this frog to anyone who wants to be more successful than they already are.  If you're content in your situation, then don't bother because you won't get the point.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I bought this on DVD because I had already started to buy the Special Edition 2 disc sets.  It's a good film, entertaining, but I have to admit I haven't watched it again yet.  That, to me, is a sign that maybe I should have got the VHS version instead.  The extras weren't that interesting.<br />Kinda worth it, if your into Trek.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is really awesome, at least to me. The thing is, not many people like the &quot;slow&quot; songs. But after listening to the other alternative bands, this one has become very refreshing. My favorite song is Amsterdam the lyrics are very good, come to think of it, all of the songs are very, very good. I'd say give it a chance.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Ok, maybe not.  But this was a pretty uninspiring movie.  Made me want to wait till the third one comes on DVD before seeing it.  The DVD doesn't have a lot of extras on it, as it may appear.<br />Buy it used, if you buy it at all.  Plus Keanu gives his best performance since Bill &amp; Ted Excellent Adventure.  He's got a big bag of nothing.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|It was such a crying shame that George's greatest album was out of print during that several-year respite. This is easily some of George's best work during his post-Beatle years and having it out of print was such a loss for die-hard Harrison fans (like myself) and the general listening public. This album is a must-own. George's distinctive mellowness in his guitar playing decorates the album, not to mention the wonderful musicianship from many celebrities helping George make this comeback. Celebrities include: Jim Keltner, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Elton John and don't forget the help given in production and musical talent from Jeff Lynne. If you were disappointed with Extra Texture, or any of George's Dark Horse releases such as Gone Troppo, Somewhere in England, Thirty Three and a Third or his self-titled album, Cloud Nine totally redeems George and his talent. If you were disappointed with Cloud Nine (who would be? Let's face it, this album is THE highlight of George's career) good news for you, the other five Dark Horse albums have been re-released. Take the other re-releases into consideration as well.

B00005JN08|4.0|To everyone out there who appreciates raunchy yet intelligent comedy (you know who you are) this movie is a must and a breakthrough, it really defies the ratings and exploits every single stereotype of european culture there is while keeping a simple plot (american guy goes to europe in search of his penpal lusting babe) attractive and fun. If you are offended, you don't appreciate comedy nor do you know how to watch movies from a different standpoint, and let's face it SOME not all of the stereotypes are and will always be true, some NOT, again if you enjoy over the top comedic performances and one liners that'll stay glued in your brain (MI SCUSI! - fred armisen nailed it!), you'll definitely enjoy Eurotrip.
B000006MS3|5.0|Okay, I'm not sure what category of music _The Dreaming_ REALLY belongs to. There is an emphasis on vocals, hooks, and strong melodies, yet the sheer musical eclecticism and wild performance make for something quite beyond your johnny-pop music. Perhaps if she had a discography of 1000 albums and she were very popular, she might be afforded her own section (at the music store: rock, jazz, classical, metal, Kate Bush). But this album's defiance of traditional characterizations is no small part of its allure, nor is it a mean artistic feat. This is Kate Bush' perfect marriage of eclectic imagination, enthralling performance, and acute songcraft. Insofar as experimental pop goes, few albums are this listenable and artistically successful.<br />And that performance...Bush sings like a woman possessed, essentially becoming different characters in each song. &quot;Houdini&quot;, with its sensuous, snaky fretless bass and dreamy atmosphere, has Bush singing at times with the sweetness of the dappling of things and at others like an irate lioness. Musically, she is just as brilliant as she is with her voice. Her sense of rhythm and texture is remarkable, as is her ability to transform her influences (both in terms of artists and musical resources) into something very unique and strange. Her reconstruction of Celtic-folk dance on &quot;Night of the Swallows&quot; is sublime; her tense, driving beat and sneaky vocals on &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot; is indelibly catchy; &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; kicks off with an infectious piano &amp; drums shuffle, and Bush's vocals range from snappy utterances (&quot;I see the people workin', I see it workin' for them&quot;) to faux-Broadway wails (&quot;just when I think I'm king, I must admit...&quot;). On &quot;Leave It Open&quot;, Bush's singing  altered with a malicious, metallic effect and is accompanied by chanting male voices and screeching synths, rising to layers of weird vocals caught up in heavy, gated percussion and terminating with Bush's voice run through tape-effects.<br />Despite this album's weirdness and somewhat introverted nature, it is catchy and unfailingly fun to listen to. This is gold, I tell you. Very highly recommended!ating with Bush's voice run through tape-effects.<br />Despite this album's weirdness and somewhat introverted nature, it is catchy and unfailingly fun to listen to.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|2003's ''In The Zone'' saw pop princess Britney Spears release her most mature album to date. The bubblegum offerings are replaced with a sting of club-oriented instalments and a tougher, yet sensual sound dominating the disc. Perhaps the urge for evolving both personally and artistic, she felt the need to explore different music styles and working with current producers. I'm for once glad she did. ''In The Zone'' is a more solid effort than its predecessors. It's evident the musical quality is better than those of her previously released records, however her voice still leaves a bit to desire on ''In The Zone''. Perhaps we may see an improvement in the years to come as I'm sure Britney will still be relevant on the music scene in some way or another. <br />The album opens with the lead single ''Me Against The Music''. The song saw the two pop tarts Britney and Madonna in perhaps the most anticipated duet of the last couple of years. One would think these two sassy ladies would have come up with a more interesting collaboration, but sadly it wasn't so. The song does have its moments-a somewhat catchy hook and the ''In The Zone'' bit, however the collaboration still remains a disappointment to this reviewer. Surely there are stronger tracks on ''In The Zone''. It puzzles me why ''Me Against The Music'' was chosen as the first single lifted off the album, perhaps the Queen of Reinvention appearance on the offering had much to do with the decision.  <br />Another highlight would include the current top 20 hit single in the US ''Toxic''. This erotic slice of  pop perfection screams hit from a distance. Even non-Britney lovers feel force to admit ''Toxic'' is indeed catchy and one of Britney's best songs to date. I believe Cathy Dennis who penned ''Can't Get You Out Of My Head'' wrote ''Toxic'' for Miss. Spears. It's is expect to hit the top 10 within the next couple of weeks and it's already a massive hit in Europe, giving Britney top 10 positions in several countries.''In The Zone'' consists of Britney's most interesting and perhaps best song to date, the infectious ''Breathe On Me''. Its Kylie/Madonna-eqsue quality may gain Britney liaisons of new-found admirers if this sensual festival is offered as a single release with a super sexy video accompany it and knowing Britney, she will try her best to do exact that. The moaning and her raspy voice works extremely well with the music and perhaps this is the music direction Britney should focus on in the coming years.<br />Others songs deservedly of a mention are ''Early Morning'' and ''Showdown''. The former is a Moby production, which is clearly evident upon hearing the song. The electronic slow-burner is enjoyable and hopefully Miss Spears and Moby may do more work in the future. ''Showdown'' has a killer beat and it's definitely worthy of a single release. The reggae-inspired boogie romp is among the stronger tracks on ''In The Zone'' and a personal favourite of mine. ''Touch Of My Hand'' is set to catch several listeners' attention with its subject- that of masturbation. Looks like Britney isn't so innocent anymore huh?<BR>''Everytime'' seems to be Britney's rebuttal to her former ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake. It's clearly one of her better vocal performance. Her voice isn't drowned in the production of the music and it's refreshing to hear some melody and real instruments on ''In The Zone''.<br />However ''In The Zone'' does have its weak moments-the silly upbeat I Got That (Boom Boom), the R. Kelly-penned ''Outrageous'', the un-inspired ''Brave New Girl'' and the annoying ''The Hook-Up''. Despite the weak material may not be entirely enjoyable at times, ''In The Zone'' has several good offerings for the listener.<br />It's evident that Britney isn't among the best vocalist, but neither is Madonna, Kylie or Janet. Those three ladies compensate in other areas and they are still regarded by millions to be among the top notch divas. Having said that Britney doesn't compare to any of those feisty ladies, however she still has years to prove her worth in the music department. She may surprise you in the years to come, you never know.<br />''In The Zone'' sees Britney attempting to find a music style that suits her, however she doesn't quite succeed just yet. The next couple of years will determinate whether or not Britney finds her niche. The overproduced sound is evident on several songs and her voice may be annoying to a few listeners, but overall ''In The Zone'' is a tolerable release. <br />Overall Rate: 6.5/10
B00005NTNM|4.0|A group of thugs passing themselves off as The People's Revolutionary Army (or something like that) grab a stockpile of weapons and ammunition, killing Harry Callahan's friend and partner in the process.  Callahan's new partner is a woman, something he does not particularly agree with, and she can barely keep up as Inspector #71 tears through San Francisco looking for the PRA.  The Enforcer (Dirty Harry #3) lacks the grit and energy of the first Dirty Harry and the excessive bullet riddled body count of the second (Magnum Force).  In comparison it almost seems sedate, both visually and in terms of its action content.  What the movie does offer is a solid, if a bit routine, police action thriller story made better than average by its script.  Harry's deathbed visit to the fading Frank DiGiorgio and his snappy relationship with rookie Inspector Kate Moore are both well done.  On the action side of things, fans will no doubt enjoy Harry's unique handling of a hostage situation, a foot chase across San Francisco's rooftops, and the kidnapping of The Mayor.  Recommended.<br />Trivia - This is the only film in the series not scored by Lalo Schifrin.  He was unavailable at the time.  Harry Guardino returns as Lt. Bressler from the first Dirty Harry and Bradford Dillman (playing Captain McKay here) would return as Captain Briggs in the fourth Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact.  Albert Popwell makes his third of four Dirty Harry appearances.  In the first Harry adventure he is the wounded bankrobber on the receiving end of Harry's famous &quot;Do you feel lucky?&quot; speech.  In the second he plays a murderous pimp who gets more than a simple traffic stop.  Here is a black militant who agrees to help Harry, for a price.  In the fourth he got to play Harry's friend and partner...uh-oh.  Sadly he is absent in The Dead Pool.
B00005ATZT|5.0|\\"The Fugitive\\" to me is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside of either the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" trilogies. This movie to me showcased how an actor who was known by two movie series could branch out into totally new territory and \\"The Fugitive\\" is the best example of this. This is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside the ID movies he starred in during the 1980s. I have never seen the original TV series so I'm not going to bother comparing that with the movie. Starring Harrison Ford as the surgeon Richard Kimble, and Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard, these two actors were perfect for their roles as antagonistic good guys, both are on the side of good but are major rivals at heart, Kimble as a man on the run, and Gerard as the pursuer of him, unaware that the real killer of Kimble's wife is walking freely without trouble and actually has one arm (His other was presumably lost in an accident).<br /> It all begins at Chicago Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago where Richard Kimble is a highly respect, world renowned surgeon who is skilled surgically grafting new artificial limbs to amputees. His life however is wrecked one night when his wife Helen Kimble is murdered by an intruder and Richard Kimble is arrested and convicted of the murder of his wife when in fact, it wasn't him. After a catastrophic bus crash kills several of his cellmates, Kimble escapes and tries to get back home, determined to hunt down the one who is truly responsible for his wife's murder. Kimble is being chased down by numerous law enforcement agents who are also determined to catch him and have him put to death but Kimble tirelessly pursues the man who is really responsible for his wife's murder and the destruction of his reputation. His chief pursuer U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard however is tirelessly hot in his trail and Kimble is always on the move. A lot of really surprising answers will be discovered during Kimble's pursuit of his wife's real killer and a very shocking truth will come up about the motives behind the murder. Kimble is hell bent on proving his innocence.<br /><br /> Almost everything that can be good about a movie especially a crime thriller comes together perfectly on \\"The Fugitive\\". The main characters Richard Kimble and Sam Gerard are absolutely incredible and show amazing depth and personality. One feels incredible sympathy for the falsely accused criminal Richard Kimble but also appalled at the Marshall's hell-bent pursuit of him when he's unaware or even cares of the target he's chasing isn't the one responsible. Chicago to me, was the perfect city for the movie to be filmed in, and the various places they go are sometimes out of the usual places and even go to places that most people don't ever see. I also love how both Kimble, and the U.S. Marshall officers figure out where Kimble really is and how Kimble himself outsmarts them every time. A lot of things really come to mind when seeing this film. When I first saw this a long time ago, it was a lot of fun with the non stop action but now I have come to realize that sometimes some of the most innocent people have been incarcerated for absolutely heinous crimes that were committed by others and even met their tragic end when the real criminals have gotten away with it even if the criminals do get apprehended in the end.<br /> Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are absolutely amazing in this movie and really brought their characters to life on here. Harrison Ford's role as Richard Kimble is absolutely powerful and moving and the numerous ways he gets places and defies his captors are just amazing, and even scary at times considering that serious real life criminals like drug dealers and serial killers and other felons use various means to defy the law. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones steals the stoplight....eh , I meant spotlight as the obsessive U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard as he is obsessively pursuing Kimble and bringing him in but also the two when speaking by phone are in fact helping to solve the real puzzle behind the crime that claimed Mrs. Kimble's life and pursue the real criminal whose behind it all. The other character worth mentioning is Dr. Nichols (The actor who plays him eludes me) as he brings some surprising answers especially towards the latter half of the movie. I also liked Joe Pantoliano as Gerard's sidekick Cosmo Renfro.<br /> You must get this movie. \\"The Fugitive\\" is one of the most gripping, edge of your seat, action crime thrillers that has come out in the last 25 years, if not the most gripping. \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" tries to imitate the whole cat and mouse pursuit styles of this movie but while good, CMIYC pales in comparison because \\"The Fugitive\\" has such powerful drama, something missing from CMIYC. Don't get me wrong, CMIYC is good in it's own way but pales in comparison. The extras in this \\"Special Edition\\" aren't really all that much to write home about and are rather unimpressive and hardly warrant this being called a \\"Special Edition\\" and the extra content adds little if anything to an already excellent movie. If you have the older DVD that was available before the special edition came out, you aren't missing out on anything on the newer edition. Despite the unremarkable extras on the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD, this movie is definitely one to own as it's one of the best movies that Harrison Ford has starred in outside of the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies.

0385504209|1.0|Brown - and the so-called professionals who give him such high praise - has no business writing.  I found this book to be dull, full of redundancies, and often laughable.  For someone so absorbed in &quot;the sacred feminine&quot; Brown and his guilt-ridden hero are pretty clueless about the modern feminine. Not to mention his appalling treatment of history.  I am not impressed.
B00005ATZT|5.0|This is my favorite crime action movie of all time. <br />Starring Harrison Ford as Dr. Kimble, it's a very moving story of when Dr. Kimble is wanted for the murder of his wife who was actually murdered by an intruder who was hired in a cover-up scan and now Kimble is determined to find the one responsible for the crime. A disgruntled detective, Sam, is hot in Kimble's trail and now Kimble is on the run to catch the killer while avoiding getting apprehended by Sam.<br /> This movie is so awesome. I have to say that this is Ford's best movie of his career and is a major essential movie. <br /> Go out and buy it today!!
B000088E6D|5.0|This fine singer, whether he sounds like a young Frank Sinatra or an earlier Harry Connick Jr., so what.  If I could sing as well as this young man I'd be at the studio.  Great classics of the ole songs that keep getting recorded because of one thing, &quot;they're great songs written by the best writers of those times&quot;.  You can't sing these great tunes unless you have the talent that Buble' has, and he has a great talent with the voice to go with it all.<br />Michael Buble' only has the stars to reach for if he continues with such great music to sing and David Foster helping along the way as he does with Josh Groban.<br />I can't imagine no one not liking this CD.  If you like the Sinatra style of music or know someone who does, you need to buy this CD and enjoy every note that Buble' sings.
B00012QM8G|5.0|It's hard to imagine the same guy releasing two films in the same year with such varied tastes and quality.  Jurassic Park was a summer blockbuster in 1993, then in the fall this one hit and proved yet again what a master filmmaker little Stevie is.<br />What isn't nearly perfect in this film?  Nearly perfect, because a completely perfect film has yet to be made.<br />Schindler's List is one of those life-altering film experiences (JFK and Lawrence of Arabia are two others, personally) that fuel your mind and compell you to read more about history.<br />Though not entirely accurate -- Oskar and his wife didn't have that tearful goodbye to Stern (they fled in the wee hours of the morning), this is excuseable for it's awe-inspiring visuals and teary music by John Williams.  The final shot (won't give it away, for those who haven't seen it) is incredibly powerful and moving.<br />This film also introduced audiences to Ralph Fiennes, playing the fiery Amon Goeth.  Unfortunately, though, his career took a dive pretty quickly (though he was good in Quiz Show, Strange Days, and Baby of Macan).<br />This is one of those films that will stick with you forever, make you think, and inspire you beyond belief.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown cleverly mixes suspense and history, but the story falls flat in the last pages.  The finale is a letdown.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|A film by Emile Ardolino<br />This is perhaps the one movie that I never expected to ever watch.  Nothing that I had heard about it made it sound like something I would have any interest in whatsoever.  I had even less of an expectation that should I actually see the movie that I would actually like it.  When I finally started watching \\"Dirty Dancing\\", it was to my great surprise when I found that I was enjoying the movie.  Simply put: this is a good movie.<br />It is the summer of 1963.  President Kennedy was still alive and there was still an attitude of innocence in America, at least this is what is presented to us in the film.  Baby (Jennifer Grey) is on vacation for three weeks with her sister and parents (Jerry Orbach, Kelly Bishop) to a resort in the Catskill Mountains.  Baby is naïve about the world and about how she relates to the world.  At the resort she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a kind of bad boy who works with the entertainment crew at the resort.  He is one of the lead dancers at the resort.  They meet and Johnny is not initially impressed with Baby (nor is anyone in the entertainment crew), but when Johnny's dance partner needs to get an abortion, Johnny needs a new dance partner so that he can perform and keep his job.  The new dance partner: Baby.  From this springs good dancing (both in the lessons as well in the performance) and a budding relationship between Johnny and Baby.<br />While I had thought the idea for this movie was a little cheesy, it was perfectly executed.  Good dancing, good music, good acting, good chemistry between Grey and Swayze, and a nice love story.  This movie far exceeded my expectations, and I am glad that I finally watched it (with thanks to my fianc&eacute; for telling me to watch it).  It is a good movie and it still holds up fifteen years after it was first released.
B000002MJC|2.0|Strange, I thought it was really bad. Actually DM hasn't put out an audibly palatible release since Violator. It's too bad I used to really love them and could always rely on them. Well at least their back catalogue is still available. Too bad we can't go back and delete this one especially. Ugh!
B00004U2G4|5.0|Forget Rod Stewart's solo pop hits.  Listen to him here with the great Jeff Beck.  Jeff Beck heads this talented group with Rod on vocals of course, Ron Wood on bass, and Mick Waller on drums.  Turn up the volume and enjoy.  Hard blues rock will turn out in the \\"Shapes of Things\\", the great \\"Morning Dew, and \\"I Ain't Superstitious.  These are just a few of the great gems on this album. The whole album is a classic that any Led Zep fan would appreciate.  This is how rock really sounds when played by a group of talented musicians.  Enjoy!
B00008G9JO|4.0|Although this isn't loaded with top 40 cuts it's a nice follow up to Songs From the Wood.  The reviewers description of One Brown Mouse as prattle is absurd.  The accoustic guitar work along with the fun story of that song deserves a positive write up.  I particularly enjoy listening it with my hot tea and scones on a cold rainy day, however, Heavy Horses isn't for everyone.
B000001GBJ|2.0|I really had looked forward to this disc, having heard a couple tracks off an online radio station. Unfortunately, track three is pretty much the strongest one, and while a few of the others are tolerable, the disc has rarely made it back into my player.<br />I think it's just too out there for me to enjoy.
B00005A46T|1.0|I hate this cd.  The only good tracks are My Plague and the Heretic Anthem.  Oh, and this cd IS SATANIC.  All they do is scream about killing and the devil.  Come on, the actual cd has the star of the devil on it.
0679428895|2.0|Pompeii was the first Harris novel I have read. I had looked forward to it based on some reviews only to be disappointed. He did a fine job with the historical and scientific material, but his plot was no better than the plots of Hollywood B movies of the 1940's and 50's. The central character, the young aqueduct engineer, was able to go without sleep or food for three days and survive the fantastic forces of the eruption of Vesuvius - more than once! Moreover, the moral stance of the novel is that it really did not matter what happened to all the other people in the path of the eruption - not just vile former slave now rich and manipulative land owner - as long as the young engineer rescued the young woman he met briefly just two days before the catastrophe. I think Harris really knows what are the geophysical consequences of a volcanic eruption, but not the human, and that is a serious fault as his central theme is the human response to the eruption.
0440237688|5.0|Looking for a quick read that you just cannot put down? Well sit back and prepare to be emerged into another amazing world of fantasy. Author Lois Lowry has created a place in our hearts and in time where conformity and sameness rules all. Welcome to a world where you can not choose anything, not even your spouse or your job. To a place where strong emotions, like tears, anger, pain, and even love, are kept from you. Imagine living in such a place, not knowing anything about the way we live now. Then, imagine receiving all of the knowledge: of war, of peace, of pain, of hunger, of love. The Giver takes you inside a life like this. You follow a young boy through all the pains and joys of our own lives, learning and growing along side him. This magical fantasy is ridiculously thought-provoking. Prepare to open your mind to new possibilities, to ask yourself: \\"what if?\\" This most enjoyable book will leave you with heart-warming experiences and a story you can play out in your own mind. I strongly suggest this book to those with great imaginations and those who are ready to be captured into a solemn truth of growing up and entering an entirely new world.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet - Le Mans is the best motor racing movie ever, and the DVD looks absolutely superb, with a terrific widescreen print that showcases the stunning cars of the era (the most exciting cars ever built in my humble opinion). In particular, the first 8-10 minutes of the race is a master class in motor sport cinematography and editing. On the first lap we are able to marvel at the sights, and incredible sounds, of the mighty Porsche 917's  and Ferrari 512's dueling, and then, as lap two begins, Michael Legrand's outstanding, upbeat and funky-ish orchestral score kicks in, helping propel the race footage to further levels of excitement. I could go on, but I won't. Buy this essential DVD.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was given this movie as a birthday gift and was very excited to watch it.  From the award hype plus the description of the film, it seemed like it might be one of those movies which goes beyond the screen and actually touches the audience.<br />It doesn't.  Instead, it was one of those movies that was so bad that you feel as if you have lost that 1 hr and 43 minutes of your life.  How bad is it?  The acting was unmoving and stiff - though I can't really blame the actors, as the script offers nothing at all to work with.  Very limited dialogue combined with poorly developed, unsympathetic characters and a frustrating lack of coherent direction makes this movie drag unlike any other film I have ever experienced.<br />I kept fighting the urge to shut it off, thinking that at some point SOMETHING vaguely interesting or entertaining would happen, but it continued to drag on and on, aimlessly, mindlessly...  <br />Then, mercifully, it ended.  My wife picked up the DVD and threw it in the trash without a word to me about it.<br />This is ABSOLUTELY an instance of Hollywood hyping a movie and the general public flocking to it and pretending to like it because they think it is supposed to be good.  PLEASE save yourself the disappointment and don't waste your time.
B000002HMH|3.0|Metallica have spent the last seven years claiming that anyone who doesn't like &quot;Load&quot; is a hatemonger out to stifle the band's musical ambitions.  Pull up a seat, Lars, it's time we had a chat.<br />First of all, you guys made a bit of a left turn on 1991's so called &quot;Black Album&quot; (didn't Prince beat you to that one?), and many self respecting &quot;old school&quot; 'Tallica fans consider it hands down your finest hour.  Do you honestly think it's the haircuts that made the difference this time around?  Let's start with pre-LP single &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;.  If I wanted dime store Smashing Pumpkins I'd have picked up &quot;Adore&quot; or that Zwan album.  Hell, stick a pair of plugs up James' nostrils and you'd have a breathy instrumental.  I still cannot figure out to this day why some people insist on pretending Hetfield can sing, but that's between you and me, Lars.  We both know who the REAL backbone of this group is.<br />Next up:  what's up with &quot;Ain't my B**ch&quot; exactly?  Bet you spent a lot of time on that one, what with it's complex time signatures and grad school lyrics.  Yes, Lars, I AM giving you sh*t.  Frankly I'm tired of listening to yours.  Have you noticed the fans at your shows getting younger and younger?  Yes, Lars, the kids DO spend more money than their thirtysomething counterparts, that wasn't my point.  Did you ever think maybe the fans are getting younger because teenagers are a bit less discriminating and thus easier to please intellectually?  Wait, you think this is a GOOD thing?  Lars, you're forty f**king years old.  Name one forty year old Priest fan who thinks &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; is their best song.  This is your legacy we're talking about here!  Are you sure you want to cash all that in for a few quick bucks?  OK, Lars, it's your life.  Art is not a democracy, you're right.  But I tell you what.  Since you're not really making anything resembling art these days do you think you might be able to take a bit of constructive criticism?  Oh?  That's great!  You say you have a roundtable discussion set up for your fans later on?  And exactly where is this little shindig?  Ah.  The county courthouse.  Say no more, Lars, say no more.
0385510438|4.0|With 'The Last Juror', John Grisham has delivered a novel that will please fans of both his courtroom dramas and his other more literary works.  While a slower-moving story than some of his other legal thrillers, I found the combination of the courtroom scenes juxtaposed with the snapshots of Clanton life circa the 'Old South/New South' era to be very effective.  You really feel as if you get to know (and  care for) the main characters...especially Willie Traynor and Callie.<br />Pick this one up and give it a try...you shouldn't be disappointed!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Even if you have never heard of Firefly before, buy it anyway. Chances are, you will like it. It is the ultimate cross-genre experience, yet doesn't come off like it's trying to be something for everyone.

This show has the best writing of any show I have ever seen, it's funny, serious, suspenseful, and best of all, has characters that you will *actually care about* Honest.

B0001ENY6M|5.0|Even apart from ths great film is the soundtrack which utilizes Middle Eastern textures much as Peter Gabriel had done with The Last Temptation of Christ, I would recommend this CD based on the enjoyment of Gabriel's score and how the music of Passion of the Christ echoes the haunting sorrow of the film so effectively.

B000002OX7|5.0|This album is a classic and must have for any classic rock listener.  My friends, 1971 was an inclusive holy year for this genre still in her teenage years.  Rock was progressing and so was the technology.  I was born in 1986, so I don't know what it was like during the Vietnam Era, but man, an album like this, puts the mental mindset in my head that I am protesting at a University against Johnson and/or Nixon because of the casualties of that war.  &quot;Baba O'Riely&quot;(Maybe Mispelled) is a great song with generous use of state of the art musical technology.  &quot;Bargain&quot; is another great song.  &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; is a classic anthem of youthful angst and was gloriously composed like Led Zeppelin's &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.  &quot;Wont get fooled again&quot; is another anthem of angst.  I feel that this is a great Liberal anthem, or an anthem for anyone who feels that they want to &quot;stop-the-man&quot;.  The bonus tracks are a treat too.<BR>-Honky Tonk Mikey...
B00005JMTN|4.0|I've been a big Tim Burton fan for years, so when the combination of his imagination with the heavenly creature that is Ewan McGregor are combined - it's a match made in movie heaven.<BR>The story revolves around a man who feels disconnected from his father and all of his \\"tall tales\\" of growing up. When his father falls ill, he returns home with his pregnant wife and tries to get to the truth of the matter when it comes to his father's life.<BR>I loved how the story kept going back and forth between the present day and the past.  Burton's imagination is one of the things I love about his films and he didn't cease to amaze me with this project.  Plus, all of the interesting characters brought into the story made the movie even more enjoyable. (My particular favorite was Karl the Giant.)<BR>Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor's performances were amazing.  I'm surprised and a bit disappointed that this movie didn't get as much credit as it deserves.  Another aspect I loved was the relationship between Bloom and his wife.  That scene where he is in the tub in his pajamas and his wife joins him just about brought me to tears.  You could still feel the love between the two characters.  <BR>Go see this movie.  It may just be a movie about tall tales, but it you'll leave feeling better about life.
B00002Z88D|4.0|At first thought you would expect a heavy metal band and an orchestra to sound sub-par.  But after listening to this CD it gives me a whole new thought.  Some of the songs sound much better with the orchestra while others seem to be lacking; let me break it down:<br />Ecstasy of Gold:  An intro for the orchestra, I guess so they can tune up or something.  Not a bad song but it's a smooth and well played song.<br />Call of Ktulu:  Another intro, this time for Metallica and why not start it with their best intrumental song?  There are some parts in the song that sound weak but overall it's just as good as it was on Ride the Lightning, and the orchestra makes it an awesome background tune.  Not to mention this song also leads straight into....<br />Master of Puppets:  Probably forever gonna be Metallica's best song and work and in this album this song doesn't disappoint.  I like the symphony in this song because it makes everything, but more importantly the solos sound more powerful.<br />Of Wolf and Man:  This song just seems to be a filler for the CD because I can think of many other songs that would have been great to hear, but after thinking about it they probably picked what they thought would sound good.  Dont get me wrong, this song is great, but it sounds better without the orchestra.<br />The Thing That Should Not Be:  The orchestra in this song contributes very well here because it makes the song and lyrics sound better in theme.  Only problem with this song is they &quot;forget&quot; the 2nd verse and yet they manage to keep the song the same length as it is on MOP.  Weird, nice filling.<br />Fuel:  Don't see why people hate this song just because it's different.  Anyway, this song sounds better with the orchestra whether you liked it in the first place or not.  Overall, great, and the solo is a killer.<br />The Memory Remains:  I liked this song at first, but then came the background &quot;na na na na&quot; which sounded awful which is why I'm glad on thisCD the orchestra gets into the foreground and the crowd starts singing which makes it sound so much better.  This song sounds much better on this CD than Reload.<br />No Leaf Clover:  This is the better of the two new songs on this CD.  Pretty much has the Load/Reload theme of music but overall a powerful sound and well played.<br />Hero of the Day:  This is where Metallica starts to get slow and steady.  This song isn't one of my favorites but it does have a great sound and rhythm.  THe orchestra contributes well in this sound and probably this may be one of the top songs they make sound better and more elaberate.<br />Devil's Dance:  I love the bass on this song but this is one of those songs where the orchestra makes the song sound weak at some points in the song than the original album.<br />Bleeding Me:  I can honestly say I was dissapointed in the way this song turned out.  Bleeding Me is one of my top favorites, but this version is VERY weak, the drumming, the guitars, vocals, everything, it sounds horrible!!  Do yourselves a favor and just skip to Disc Two after Devil's Dance.<br />Nothing Else Matters:  This was a great song to start out with because with the orchestra playing, this song sounds sooo much deeper.  I just wish James wouldn't have would have kept the &quot;Matters&quot; part of the vocals long instead of cutting it short.  That almost kills the song.<br />Until It Sleeps:  This is another song that sounds weak and probably one the weakest next to Bleeding Me.  This song really isn't that great to begin with so it'll be a song to skip on the track.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls:  One word: AWESOME!!  This song sounds the best with the orchestra playing and since it's already a powerful song, you can only imagin.  The only thing I can say is I wish they had the bell sounds in there and that they didn't cut the ending short.<br />Minus Human:  They're 2nd of the new songs adn even though this one sounds deeper, I still think Clover is better.  Once again this song has the Load/Reload theme so if you are not a fan of those albums, you may not like this one.  Overall it's a strong song from start to finish.<br />Wherever I May Roam:  Once again, another disappointment to a great song.  There are some weak points, adn those would be the guitars and vocals, it sounds like James is trailing off at some points which can kill the song instantly.  I prefer the Black Album version better.<br />Outlaw Torn:  My favorite song and this song is strong from start to finsih.  My only dissapointment is that the background vocals are too deep.  Great song with an even better solo.<br />Sad But True:  No disappointment here, the orchestra sounds superb in this song.  Nice and heavy throughout and the solo sounds extra powerful.<br />One:  Well, with the weak sound of ...And Justice for All carried one into this song, the orchestra drowns the drums out almost completely which is a major flaw in this song.  Although it still sounds good, the drums should have been stronger.<br />Enter Sandman:  Hmm, what was once an awesome intro song has turned into a great near ending song with just the sound of symphony.  Everything sounds great in this song with the orchestra, the entrance, the middle and the break at the end (which gives the song an extra twist)<br />Battery:  You can't end an album better than this.  This song is strong from start to finish and never disappoints.  The song is also another area where the orchestra makes the solo sound so much more powerful.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Dude the Wretched Spawn is the best cannibal corpse album in their 15 year existence. Corpsegrinder's vocals on this album are more brutal than they have ever been. Corpse is in rare form with this album. Since they got Neil Kernon to produce it it sounds flawless. In my opinion the best soung is nothing left to mutilate or they deserve to die. Buy this album now its definitely a death metal classic already. If you haven't already see these guys live it will be the brutalist show you have ever been too. Keep supporting metal
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The Matrix was a great, self-contained Sci-Fi movie.  It had a beginning, middle, and end, and spent most of that time kicking you in the head courtesy of wild beat-downs and gun fu.  And although it had its logical flaws (entropy, anyone?) it was a clever premise well executed.<br />It is sadly apparent that The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revollutions did not &quot;need&quot; to be made, except insofar as folks wanted to make it a franchise to print more money.  Reloaded is an aimless, sterilized mess of a movie, with unexpectedly *bad* CGI in places and none of the raw punch of The Matrix.  It takes too long to go nowhere, and is only saved by its hinting at Something Really Cool to come later.  Unfortunately, the possibilities it hints at never come to pass... Revolutions winds up so straightforwardly dumb that even the watered-down Reloaded only sets you up for a letdown at the end of this exercise in cashing in impersonating a &quot;deep&quot; Sci-Fi experience.  But that's another review.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Verbatim from book to film is rarely a smooth or desireable result, and I'm glad the director didn't go that way in his approach. I thought the film was beautiful in its cinematography. That's crucial, because it carries the weight of what dialogue or narrative cannot be put in. I also found that although the horse was the central character, the people around him were much a part of Seabscuit's persona in the movie. He was as beat up as the people living through the Depression. He personified their indomitable spirit and the fire in their eyes and their souls that would not accept defeat. I think this is the kind of movie that you have to watch more than once, because you'll realize many things, but dwell on just one for that one viewing. The next viewing, you come back to that other realization, and so on. That's why there are certain movies we like to watch multiple times. And when there is that movie you want to watch more than once, it's worth getting on DVD. This is one of them.
0440238609|5.0|I really enjoyed these books! The storyline is great. I couldn't put these books down, and I love all this contrversy it has caused! Read these books ASAP, and you will be in for the best read of your life!
0618001905|5.0|Less than 50 years after agents of King Leopold had murdered, raped, tortured, mutilated, and brutalized half of the population of the Congo, Congolese schoolchildren were taught from Belgium drafted textbooks that Leopold was the benevolent father figure of their country.  That is the definition of revisionist history, yet books like this one are more likely to be attacked as being revisionist.  Hochschild has written a history that reads with the ease of a newspaper about a subject that has been buried in the annals of mis-history.  10 million Africans were killed for the enrichment of one man and his partners and yet most people have never heard of this story!    That this genocide is virtually unknown to most people is a sad reminder of how much injustice has been perpetuated upon Africans over the centuries that has been &quot;forgotten.&quot;  Among the more fascinating aspects of this book are the profiles of the leaders of the human rights movement, white and black, who at the turn of the century showed super-human courage and integrity in fighting against political and journalistic malfeasance, bribery, and significant risks to their own lives in order to expose to the world the magnitude of the Belgium atrocities committed in the Congo.  Dinesh D'Souza, to whom my title refers, is among those who seek to deny or downplay the crimes committed by or for colonialists.  Hopefully this book will cast too bright a light for such distortions of the truth to prevail.  An enlightening book that I highly recommend.
B000089RVX|1.0|I bought this album for the singles &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, &quot;Going Under&quot;, and &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  I was so disappointed!!  The rest of the album sounds absolutely NOTHING like these songs!  After song seven, I began to wonder if track five was set on repeat!!  &quot;Hello&quot; sounds remotely close to &quot;My Immortal&quot;, but doesn't quite add up.  Do yourself a big favor and just buy/download the singles!  I'm selling this to some other unsuspecting person A.S.A.P.!!  Go ahead and press the &quot;not helpful&quot; button, I don't care!
0590373587|4.0|This book is excellent. It explores the futuristic society in which twelve year old Jonas lives. The story is an eye opening experience. It will make you realize just how many choices you do have. The book overall is very good. It is full of symbols, but definetly not over complicated. The ending of the book is very unclear. The book leaves you to pick your own interpretation. Which can be good if you like that. I personally like the ending to be decisive. I want to know what happens to the characters.
0553579908|5.0|This is the best epic serious fantasy series out there by far. Gets away from the cookie-cutter books of Brooks, Eddings and Goodkind, which are quick fun reads. Martin keeps your intrest unlike the endless Jordan Wheel of Time series, which I have temporarily given up on. This series is very original. And each book is better than the last. Lots of political intrique where the magic is very little at first, increasing as the books go on. Great characters and multi-storylines merging into one big showdown. Only problem is the series is not comlete. Only 3 of 6 are written, book 4 A Feast For Crows constantly being delayed. Mr. Martins website does update and has a sample Arya chapter from book 4. READ IT. In the meantime if you want a series that is complete and very good. I reccomend Memory Sorrw and Thorn trilogy by Tad Williams. Book one being The DragonBone Chair. Not quite on par with Martin. But very enjoyable none the less. Martin is gritty, graphic and realistic.Major characters do die!  You will loathe villains in one chapter and be cheering for them in the next. I.E Tyrion and Jamie. Two of my favorites. Please read you will love!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life! Combine Fugazi, The Fall, Bauhaus, and Radiohead with a touch of electronica ala The Crystal Method, and you get Relationship of Command, an all time classic. Every song is full of power and energy, and the songs just plain kick ass. The opener, Arcarsenal, is one of the best album openers ever, right up there with Whole Lotta Love, Sympathy For The Devil, and Baba O' Riley. Cedric Bixler has one of the best voices for rock. Even though the words are nonsense, he sings and screams them like he was Malcom X. Along with that are the great guitar interplay of Omar Rodriguex and Jim Ward, who are perfect for what they do. Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajar make a great rhythym section. They can be flashy, but they also know how to make a heavy song seem extra heavy.<br />The best songs would have to be Arcarsenal, One Armed Scissor, with the weird tempo changes and swirly guitarplaying, Invalid Litter Dept., which just rules near the end, and Quarentined, perhaps the heaviest song on the album. Relationship Of Command also has some great variety on it too, such as electronica on Enfilade, and some Cure like songs such as Non Zero Possibilty. I also dig Iggy Pop singing on Rolodex Propaganda.<br />This is a great album to listen to whenever you feel like it. ATDI shall be missed.
055357342X|5.0|This is the best epic serious fantasy series out there by far. Gets away from the cookie-cutter books of Brooks, Eddings and Goodkind, which are quick fun reads. Martin keeps your intrest unlike the endless Jordan Wheel of Time series, which I have temporarily given up on. This series is very original. And each book is better than the last. Lots of political intrique where the magic is very little at first, increasing as the books go on. Great characters and multi-storylines merging into one big showdown. Only problem is the series is not comlete. Only 3 of 6 are written, book 4 A Feast For Crows constantly being delayed. Mr. Martins website does update and has a sample Arya chapter from book 4. READ IT. In the meantime if you want a series that is complete and very good. I reccomend Memory Sorrw and Thorn trilogy by Tad Williams. Book one being The DragonBone Chair. Not quite on par with Martin. But very enjoyable none the less. Martin is gritty, graphic and realistic.Major characters do die!  You will loathe villains in one chapter and be cheering for them in the next. I.E Tyrion and Jamie. Two of my favorites. Please read you will love!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is where rock started.  Jimi's roots from the blues style clearly shows, but all bands, including some of the gimic bands that previous viewers mentioned (blink 182, green day, pennywise) came from stuff like Hendrix and the Beatles.  Many may say that Jimi wasn't that good, but he was revolutionary.  He created sounds that no one else at that time could produce.  Jimi Hendrix is one of the forefathers of rock.  Comparing bands like blink 182 and green day to Jimi Hendrix is just wrong guys.

B00018TI5E|5.0|most people i know who hear johns first two albums are appalled and offended, usually refering in some way to a dying cat. or a man with his weiner slammed in a car door... i dont understand where theyre coming from those two records have remained two of my favorites, niandra for almost ten years, and smile for atleast six.. as a guitar player AND a singer there really isnt anyone in the same room with him.  Smile From the streets you hold was a document from the bowels of heroin addiction with similar depth and bile as william burroughs' naked lunch.... and now john is clean his two albums since getting sober glow with the same elusive peace and gratitude that his first two could only shiver in the corner and dream about so few of us are pulled from those gates of insanity and death im so glad that today john is among them....
B00002EPMF|5.0|This is the ultimate opus from Chuck Schuldiner before his too early death in 2001 (december 13th). It is also one of his greatest ones. Not the best? How could you answer such a question concerning this authentic genius : all his albums are pure masterpieces, each different from the previous and from the next : here is his last contribution to his experiments in music : he doesn't sing anymore and leaves the vocals to an honest singer (Tim Aymar) who can realize what Chuck couldn't due to his vocal registry : the songs are clear, not any shout : just a VOICE singing! It changes but it is largly positive : the music of Chuck Shuldiner can at last deliver its own beauty (it was actually the case before, but required a serious listening, not an &quot;ambiant&quot; one)thanks to a singer who can show almost immediately the depth and emotion of the notes Chuck Shuldiner created. Worse is consequently his death for he had just begun to tread new paths for a wider audience...
B00005V0X5|5.0|I first started listening to Megadeth a little under 2 years ago. I've always liked em but never been that big of a fan.  Sure Rust in Peace is a great album, and Countdown and Peace Sells are both good, but those last 2 never seemed to be as good as they were made out to be.  None of there other albums were nearly as revered as those three, and if they weren't going to be even on the level with Peace or Countdown I didn't see any real need to run off and pick any of them out right away. I dunno about the rest of their discography, but I was foolish to put off picking this up for so long. I may be the only person alive who feels this way, but I think this is much, much better than Peace or Extinction, and even tops Rust in Peace, as well.<br />I have not heard the original version, but I can tell you that this version sounds fabulous.  This version sounds multitudes better than the other thrash albums from the era. It sounds way, way better than Peace Sells or Rust, and even better than Countdown, imho. It's got great clarity, perfect balance and still plenty of power.  On top of this, Mustaine's typically subpar vocals are much better here.  I would dare say he's even 'good' on this album, for the most part.(This is especially important, because Megadeth were actually atypically good at writing vocal melodies, which were, obviously, hurt by Mustaine's not so good voice.) The album is very solidly constructed as well.  The songs are generally short, all between 3-5 minutes, but they are always complete and nicely formed.  Plus they still manage to have plenty of great leads with out just tacking them on endlessly, as they would later do.  The rhythm section is just great.  Gar never impressed me too much in Peace Sells, but perhaps I'll have to go re-evaluate his work there after hearing.  He's not the very best thrash drummer, but he's pretty distinctive and very tasteful throughout. As an added bonus, you can actually hear Ellefson's bass, and he's got some nice lines and a few very brief, but entertaining leads.<br />In the end, the reason I like this album best is simply cause I think it's got better songwriting then the others. It's very consistent, with the only slip-up being Chosen Ones, which isn't bad, just kinda average.  The obvious standout is Looking Down the Cross, which is easily my favorite Megadeth song.  It kinda seems like a darker, more ominous Hallowed be They Name.  It has loads of atmosphere, blazing solos that always compliment the song, great melody without sacrificing the riffage, intense and powerful vocals and is instantly memorable despite not having a chorus.  An all time classic.  The title track, Rattlehead and Loved to Deth are all first class straight up pounding metal tracks. The title track is especially terrific, and is a perfect condensation of what thrash is all about. The Skull Beneath the Skin is a bit more along the lines of Looking Down the Cross, and is probably the second best track here.  Not as much atmosphere or melody, but it's still unconventionally structured, and has got plenty of powerful riffwork.  The much famed Mechanix is quite good, despite having the stupidest lyrics of any song I can think of.  Fortunately, I don't care about lyrics at all. (on a side note, I prefer The 4 Horsemen. The middle break they added absolutely makes that song, and the riffs sound better played a bit slower.  Mechanix is still cool though. On a further tangent, yeah I think this is better then Kill 'em All, but that ain't really a valid comparison since this came two years later. In many ways, Kill 'em All is Dave's debut album even though he didn't play on it. Both Dave and Metallica got a whole lot more experience in those 2 years, and frankly it would be a lot more valid to compare this to Ride the Lightning. But enough of that.)  These Boots is found in an edited form here.  I've never heard the original, and it would probably be better if it weren't edited, but it's still quite good. (and the prolonged beeps are kinda amusing) It's a joke song that work as both a joke and a song, so it's quite worth while.  The demo tracks are a waste of time, but they didn't cost me any extra so who cares.<br />Anyways, this is a damn good thrash album, and one of high historical improtance to boot.  Pick it up.d the prolonged beeps are kinda amusing) It's a joke song that work as both a joke and a song, so it's quite worth while.

B0001ENY6M|5.0|Exactly what I was hoping for in relation to the theme of this film - a haunting, moving score with scope and drama.  Far more satisfing then the &quot;Gospel of John&quot; score which was plesant enough but overall forgetable, this one blends the middle eastern ethnic insturmentation and vocalizations seamlessly with the more western orchestral and choral elements to really grab the listener and transport you to another space and time.  Other than a few passages that sounded like James Horners &quot;Glory&quot; for some strange reason, this is possibly one of Debneys best to date.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is really one of the better musical inspirations that has come out in awhile.  With all of the reviews already, I'd be repeating to try to explain their style, but I can tell you I saw them live at the University of Maine and they were incredible.  It made the album seem like it was a cover band trying to capture their true sound.<br />Songs About Jane melds sexuality, soulfulness, happiness, sadness, wittiness, and many other mature elements that truly show a great intellect in the musicianship as well as the lyrical content.  A sense of duality is always entertained, and that is truly refreshing.<br />If you like \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and what has been on mass rotation, check out this CD.  Those songs are just the tip of the iceberg.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye is like no other rapper out there, instead of talking about killing people and 9 mills, he talks about geting in a car wreck and michiael jackson LOL. he is a very good dope ass rapper, the best song off the cd is &quot;through the wire&quot; and &quot;slow Jamz&quot; with TWISTA. Go out and get this masterpiece.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a great film. Although some argue that this is not historical fact. I did not go to see Braveheart for it's historical factors, and although I find \\"William Wallace\\" interesting figure in history, this movie was awesome for what is was. It is violent and I would not recommend children to be allowed to watch it at home but, the musical score itself is breathtaking and the scenery in the background is beautiful. The camera work was beautiful and it basks in every emotion possible. Love, fear, patrotism, hate, self-doubt... ect... I enjoyed this film very much and later I also bought the soundtrack and enjoy it very much also.
B000003TBP|5.0|The best way to describe Beck is to say that his songs are music for music's sake.  They dont' always (or usally, really) make sense, and I suppose you could say they arent' \\"real music\\", in the sense that most music is (like the Beatles or Van Halen or most music that you hear, really).  But it IS \\"fun music\\", I suppose you could say.  Odelay is like..PURE Beck. It's Beck at his best. One Foot in the Grave was interesting, in it's own folky way, as was Stereopathetic Soulmanure, and \\"Mellow Gold\\" was way cool, of course, but \\"Odelay\\" is all of the best qualities Beck has rolled into one.  You dont' know what the lyrics mean all the time (usually it's just like poetry - there is no real meanign - it's just words that paint pictures in your head), but you make the songs yours after a while - and that, perhaps is the best thing about listenign to Beck  - there is plenty room for interpretation.  \\"Devil's Haricut\\" is a good rock number - it starts off the album nicely.   \\"Hot Wax\\" is just..genius, really.  Just a nice groovy song.  It makes Beck look cool, for such a little guy he is. It's a nice song and whatnot.  \\"Lord Only Knows\\" is good for like..some long night drive that you are on alone, or some long walk on your own (I used to take long walks and listen to Beck), and it's night, and..it's just a nice song.  \\"Derilect\\" is the worst sogn on the album - to be honest, it kind of sucks.  \\"Minus\\" (kind of an ode to..the feeling of being a teenager or something, I geuss.  That's my interpretation atleast) is a good one - has a nice manic energy to it.  Novicane is also pretty cool.  The others I would list as best songs on the album are  \\"Jack-ass\\" and  \\"Ramshackle\\", which are kind of..introspective songs, I suppose is how you could describe them.  WHo knows what they wil remdind you of - that's the way it is with Beck songs.  The others are okay.  \\"Where It's At\\" is the one that was always on the radio back in the summer of 96.  MOst people would most likely say thatit's THE best song on the cd, and they'd probably be right, but after hearing it for a long time, the other songs seem more appealing, imho. High 5 (Rock The Catskills) is also pretty cool - it's kind of funny when the \\"do you like designer jeans?\\" part comes along.  Sissyneck is intersting - good lyrics, like \\"writing my will on a three-dollar bill\\".  Readymade is so/so.  \\"The New Pollution\\" is also pretty cool - it was on MTV all the time back then, but not the best song, imho.  Dont' get freaked out when you have your cd player on highest volume and Jack-Ass has ended, becuase there is \\"bonus noise\\" on this cd, and it's kind of a shock (epecially if you're stoned or something).  Anyway, that's all I have to say about Odelay.  Go and buy it and you're pretty much guarenteed to like it.  Keep in mind that it grows on you.
B000069CWE|3.0|Personaly, I was impressed by the remix of Jay Gordon &quot;Pts of Auth&quot;.  Anyway, I was a bit disapointed of the other titles that were basicly rap.  Mike is a good vocalist, but dont push your luck!  You rock with Chester but not with those other guys!  <br />I wouldnt mind earing Snoop Dogg, but Motion Man, come on!
B000127LW2|3.0|I am a lover of this series and have been waiting for so long to collect Voyager on DVD.  I received in the mail today what must be the biggest let down that Star Trek has ever delivered.  A see-through orange plastic case that holds the dvd's.  There are no inserts, no pictures on the dvd's, and the case splits into two in a way that is very awkward.  I paid $90.00 for this??!!<br />I so hope the Voyager people read these reviews because I will not give them anymore of my money unless they improve their product.  I feel so disrespected as a fan of this series.  Packaging may not seem like a big deal, but when you compare it to the TNG dvd's - the difference is night and day.
B00008K9Z5|5.0|The ppl who are writting all crap about how Linkin Park is over rated are just lost.  They dont know what they stand for!  Anyway, intense music, good sound, rock on!<br />Though, it is not better then Hybrid Theory!
0385510438|4.0|Grisham has a unique talent to write about small, Southern towns and make them a place you want to live. He uncovers the good and the bad but he also makes you think. Miss Callie is a woman I would have loved to have known, for her strength, courage and commitment to her Lord and Savior &amp; her family. Sure this book isn't a taut legal thriller, but it has it's moments. This book is more a character study which Grisham has a way with, especially when it comes to Southerners. Read it and enjoy it.
0684803356|5.0|It is not by mere circumstance that a novel is considered a classic.  It takes years and years of the work standing up to critique, criticism, public response, and the test of time.  The latter is perhaps the greatest of example of why Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is labeled among the great works of the twentieth century.  This novel's moving and intense story has not lost meaning over the years of its existence.  The romance and adventure appeals to fans of many different genres, but to call this book a war narrative is missing the scope and depth of the work by a long shot.  Hemingway, as he does in many of his books, brings into view some of the most basic questions and sought-after answers that have always been at the heart of the nature of man.  Hemingway explores the very simple yet profound principles of death and honor in this work, and his conclusions are by no means simple reflections.<BR> While only occurring over the course of several days, the events that take place in For Whom the Bell Tolls, along with the superb style of writing, draw the reader into the world of Robert Jordan, the book's protagonist, while he attempts to destroy a fascist-controlled bridge, and along the way discovers humanity, love, and himself.  This is possibly Hemingway's greatest feat in the novel: the creation of a connection between oneself and humanity; that we all share a responsibility with each other and that our honor lies in the hands of our neighbors.<BR> As a fairly long book, For Whom the Bell Tolls is by no means a story for inexperienced or pedestrian readers, and even an older audience might find the plot tedious at some points.  However, there is ample swashbuckling to satiate the thirst for adventure of any war genre fan, and plenty of romance to keep a reader of softer disposition happy.  The journey is well worth the effort, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of great literature.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All.  Its more than an album title.  It is a statement.  This album takes Metallica, who already gave the masterpieces Master of Puppets &amp; Ride the Lightning, to the arena rock level they deserved.  The epic One, with its melodic riffs turned into a pounding assault of the ears, is without a doubt the song that made thrash.  It brought it to the masses, and that is a good thing.  This album gave us Blackened, the title track, Harvester of Sorrow, Dyers Eve...what else could you ask for?  MUST OWN!

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Do not watch this. I'm serious. I watched it with intensity for two hours hoping something would tie it together. No. No direction at all, no plot, nothing.<br />Now, I have to admit that Bill Murray had his good scenes (because he's a funny guy). Also that the movie had great artistically composed scences. The composistion was amazing. You could pause the film on any frame and have an amazing peice.
0679311718|5.0|This book was released in Canada several months and I ordered it from Amazon's sister site there (you can get it from them much cheaper and faster, by the way)<br />Dallaire was Force Commander during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and, as such, is able to provide the first insiders view of the collapse of the Arusha Accord, the subsequent resumption of hostilities between the RPF and the RGF and the rapidly unfolding genocide. <br />General Dallaire spends much of his book discussing his attempts to implement the Arusha Accords and, when that failed, to secure a cease-fire and protect innocent civilians. He also chronicles his frustrations with some of the troops sent to assist in the peacekeeping mission and the trouble he had getting money, supplies or even an effective mandate from the UN. <br />Dallaire's coverage of some important issues such as the historic Hutu-Tutsi rivalry, the role of the Interhamwe in the genocide or the US role in preventing more forceful action are cursory but, in fairness, they were not intended to be the focus of this book. <br />Dallaire has done the world a great service by chronicling his experience nearly a decade after his life was upended, and 800,000 Rwandan lives were lost, in one of the most horrific humanitarian tragedies in history. And while this book is a great value to those who have a relatively deep understanding of the genocide, it might not be the best introduction for those who know little or nothing about it. Dallaire provides a great amount of detail, but not necessarily the elementary background and big picture views required to understand just who was involved and what was transpiring during this chaotic 100 days.<BR> <BR>In the end, Dallaire is a hero, as are Brent Beardsley and so many others who risked their lives to save the lives of others. And we are fortunate that General Dallaire has agreed to share his story. Perhaps with this book, the international community finally begin to take its obligations seriously.  Anguished cries of &quot;Never Again!&quot; followed by inaction will never save the lives of innocent victims.
B000000LZV|4.0|Of all the grand albums of the the 80's. This was the one that alluded me. While Zen arcade blasted me with caustic hardcore, then smoothed out towards dark psychedelic pop and Meatpuppets II conquered me with its unique blend of psychedelia, country, punk, and Zepplenian classic rock. This record always was a mystery to me . It was like a diabolical hyprid of wire and CCR. For the first 2 listens, it bored me to the point where i wanted to strangle the crooning Boone. Then I listened to it again and I got through the jungle of boring Music and began enjoying it. Especially Corona, Dr. Wu, Dont look now, It aint no picnic and Love dance.<br />Although I still think its a little overrated (Mainly due to the lack of coherenence in the beggining), I still enjoy the majority of the album and would recomend it to anyone looking for something  new.  <br />Anarchy and peace
B00004RF97|5.0|Of the romantic comedy, screwball comedy and regular vanilla comedy, this movie ranks Number 1 in all three categories.  The movie has three of the greatest actors/actresses in the history of motion pictures and they play off each other perfectly in this movie.  The screenplay utilizes the haughtiness of Katherine Hepburn spot on early in the movie then goes on to show her all too human side later in the film.  Jimmy Stewart is well deserving of the awards and acclaim he earned for the role of wisecracking tabloid writer with a talent for more than just sensational stories.  Cary Grant does what he always does, plays the perfect foil to the female lead and does it so smoothly.  The rest of the characters are well cast, as well, from Uncle Willie to Seth Lord to the social climbing George Kitteridge to Dinah, the precocious younger sister.  It's an outstanding clean comedy that everyone should see over and over to catch all the little nuances and humor.  If I could only see one movie, this would be the ONE.  I heartily and enthusiatically recommend this movie to all movie buffs.
B00009Z574|3.0|3 stars for the album - 5 for the remaster.<br />It's nice to finally hear &quot;Picasso&quot;.  Jon sings a bit of it in the Yesyears video.   <br />And just a correction to another review.  Jon didn't write &quot;Onward&quot;.  Chris did.
B00000HZFH|3.0|I'm a bit iffy about this album. I thought i found an indie band i can finally enjoy. BTS are obviously talented songwriters and musicians but there is still a few things that let this album down for me that i just can't ignore. First of all the production sucks. Like another reviewer said they sound too flat and trebly. I know they're into the whole indie lo-fi thing, but thier arrangements are more complex and guitar driven than your typical indie band. They would really benefit from a higher production budget. The other thing is what most indie bands suffer from. The vocals stink! Every song has the exact same flat whiney &quot;slacker&quot; vocals that Stephen Malkmus made so hip. Except this guy is much worse than SM. He sounds more like Michael Stipe after a lobotomy. But for some reason it's blasphemous for an indie band to actually try and sing. Other than that though, this is a very well crafted album. The guitar playing is suberp and nicely layered. The lyrics are clever and the band comes up with some amazing hooks. Such a shame they have to give in to their indie image.
B000002GYI|5.0|It's rediculous how good this album is.  I was at a record store and picked it up on tape (a brand new tape in 2004?).  They had the CD but for some reason I thought the tape would be a better buy.  A nod to nostalgia.  Anyhoo, I bought it and was blown away.  It's not dated (at least to me).  When I listened to it with my little brother he was like &quot;Woah, who is this,&quot; and I've been preaching the Kraftwerk gospel ever since.  Don't let my rambling talk and bad spelling turn you away from this album.  It's a keeper!
B000002UR7|5.0|Too bad for all those people that caught on later. Some of radiohead fans have been there from the beginning. I love new radiohead but for the same reasons anymore. They have changed and some argue its for the better but that really does little to convince long time RH fans. We love this album because it was there for us when we were young and it introduced me to some of my favorite music. I can identify with this album more than any other RH album. Hey, thats just me like it or not. Anyone that says they dont like this album is simply ignoring the musical beginnings of a rock and roll icon. Without Pablo Honey there would be no OK Computer.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This score brings the visual effects of the movie back to your mind's eye.  The music is stunning and surreal, emotional and inspiring.  However, without a large vocal presence, it lacks a true representation of what music was like in the time of Jesus.  This is a modern composition with the purposes of accenting and adding emotion to the film and it does a great job.<br />If you are looking for a more authentic representation of what music was like around the time of Jesus, you should look into the group SAVAE. This group is a renowned vocal and instrumental group dedicated to exploring the origins of ancient music.  Their latest project was released about a year ago, oddly enough, titled  ANCIENT ECHOES &quot;Music from the time of Jesus and Jerusalem's Second Temple&quot;.  <br />This cd captures the essence of what music was like during the time of Jesus.  It is performed with historically accurate insruments and lyrics are sung in the ancient dialects of Hebrew,Greek, and Jesus' native language....ARAMAIC!  The lyrics were composed from the dead sea scrolls, other ancient texts, and has been faithfully reconstructed.  <br />If you want to be transported even further than where this movie and soundtrack take you.....add SAVAE's Ancient Echoes-Music from the time of Jesus to this experience!
0452282152|5.0|This book was a fantastic read, I did not want to put it down and wished that it would not end.  The author takes a subject, the painting for which the book is named, that is surrounded in mystery and creates a story in which it can rest.  The painting of the girl is one of intrigue, a young girl who has no name, place or time is engaging the viewer on a very personal level.  Chevalier creates an entirely plausible explanation of the identity of the girl using a wonderful blend of fact and fiction that makes it hard to discern between the two.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those with any interest in art history.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is the album that made Manson an internationally recognised figure, though for somewhat wrong reasons as he was portrayed in a one-dimensional light as a 'shock-rocker' who makes angsty albums for angsty teenagers.<BR>There are elements of truth in that but the sheer unadulterated intelligence of Manson was gleaned over as it would contrast with the label of shock-rocker.<BR>This is a shame, as behind the image and stereotype, this is a thinking mans rock album. The album is split into three 'cycles', chapters if you will, much like a novel. Each cycle has a different musical and lyrical style, making for an album that is very diverse yet coherent with the tracks melding into one another in transitional periods. The overall concept demands much thought and analysis on the viewers behalf and reads much like a work of Nietsche.<BR>Musically the album is best described as hard-rock with much texture and subtle melody, from the mellotron/flute duet at the end of 'Cryptorchild' to Trent Reznors piano which supplements the reflective atmosphere of the beautiful 'Man That You Fear'.<BR>This is very much an albums that demands repeated listening to get the concept and find hidden subtleties that you didnt notice before. Overall this album should be listened to with an open mind and I would best recommend this to those who appreciate both hard-rock and the intellectual aspects of an album.
B0000027RL|5.0|This by far is one of the best albums of all time. Not just by rock standards either. It's got everything that you could ask for in an album. If you haven't heard the whole album. BUY IT NOW. Even if your not a huge fan of the band, BUY IT NOW. You will appreciate this classic.
B000002U82|5.0|I first heard this album when my parents bought it when we moved to England in 1991, I was 4 at the time so the sounds of the album have been very much familiar with me, it wasn't until last year that I listened through the album once more that I could truly appreciate the sheer brilliance of it.<BR>The music is transcendent of many genres and can be appreciated by anyone from any culture who appreciates music.<BR>What is even more amazing is that this was made 30 years ago, and it still stands the test of time and continues to inspire to this day.<BR>This was the album that made me discover music and I cannot listen to an album unless it was built as a whole rather than a collection of tracks.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have every Dream Theater album, and i have been listening to this guys from their beginning... I agree with all of you, I think this is the hardest album theyve made. Lots of heavy riffs, very fast solos and lots of angry... I think they have just discovered a new way to make music and I think its great... This is a very worth album.... Buy it!!!!!
B000060OFT|5.0|Not only is this movie amazingly directed, but it also helps to understand what Sheakespear wanted to get across to the viewer. Having the characters set to a modern time made it a lot more interesting- such as having guns and or drugs.
B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes are one of the most unique bands around today on the rock scene, whether its their strange musical sound of raw garage punk, or the fact that they are a brother/sister combination (or are they?), they have been causing a huge impact recently, and Elephant, their fourth studio album, is an impressive collection of amazing guitar riffs, slick drum beats and wailing vocals, which will impress old fans of the band and no doubt attract countless new fans as well. Lets break it down:<br />The Good &gt;&gt; First of all, the first single to be lifted from the album, Seven Nation Army, in my opinion was easily the best single of 2003, proving Jack White is one of the most incredible guitarists on the planet today. Black Math is a very heavy offering in comparison to the rest of the album, and is a bit different from usual. Hardest Button To Button has an infectious beat, and crazy lyrics which make this another standout.<br />But in my opinion, things get a whole lot better in the closing moments of the album. Hypnotize is an amazing fast paced blend of heavy guitars and crashing drums, with hysterical vocals, and The Air Between My Fingers is also one of the strongest tracks on the album. Well Its True That We Love One Another provides a fitting climax to the album, as the duo hire the help of vocalist Holly Golightly and produce a very humourous end.<br />The Bad &gt;&gt; Covering the classic Bart Bachrach track 'I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself' is a bad move, as they struggle to plough through it, and the more mellow offerings such as I Want To Be The Boys To Warm Your Mothers Heart appear far too frequently on the album. Meg makes her singing debut on track In The Cold Cold Night, and whereas she is better than I expected, this is a bit too bland.<br />~Quick Stats~<br />Number Of Tracks &gt;&gt; 14<BR>Number Of Good Tracks &gt;&gt; 10<BR>Number Of Bad Tracks &gt;&gt; 4<BR>Best Track &gt;&gt; Seven Nation Army<BR>Worst Track &gt;&gt; In The Cold Cold Night<BR>Worth Buying? &gt;&gt; Yes<BR>Overall &gt;&gt; ****/***** Highly Recommended<br />So overall this is certainly worth getting. A few poor tracks are thankfully overshadowed by some amazing singles and album tracks, and this is easily one of the most essential purchases of last year.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I'm very critical of most movies today. I'm pretty much of a film snob. I haven't made my mind up if it's a great Film...probably not. BUT, it IS a great great movie. Murray is superb and I fall in love with Andy MacDowell everytime I watch it. So for me, it's about love.<br />I feel about this movie the way I feel about Bogdonovich's &quot;Heartbreak Kid&quot;<BR>..a very different movie but I'm obsessed with both.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|Master and Commander is a terrific swashbuckling naval adventure set during the Napoleonic War. While it contains the excitement of many older and wonderful naval films such as Captain Blood or The Black Pirate, you won't find anyone swinging from ropes in this film as it is much more realistic as far as individual feats. The excitement and action are tempered with an attempt to portray the horror and butchery of 19th century naval warfare in a fairly realistic manner. When solid shot hits the ship, splinters rain death and destruction on everyone nearby. No one looks clean or pretty after any of the battle scenes.<br />What sets this action film apart from most action pictures in recent years is it has a script! Action scenes are brief and exciting, but the real story comes from the character development and respectably written dialog. The friendship between the ship's surgeon and the captain as well as that between the surgeon and a very young officer are well developed and draw you into the story so that you do care what happens to these characters. You'll want to sing Rule Britannia when the crew goes into combat in the final battle scene of the film!<br />The film balances the excitement and romance of The Age of Sail nicely with its more unpleasant features, like bug-ridden biscuits, water shortages and the terrors of combat and being lost at sea, all while creating memorable characters. Tension and suspense are created in numerous ways, not just through mindless action sequences as in some films. The nature footage taken at the Galapagos Islands is splendid too; the film has wonderful cinematography. An exciting film worth seeing.
B00000DHRX|5.0|George Michael's voice can take one's breath away...his voice is so so romantic. I love this cd. Romantic and heartfelt strings can be pulled upon while listening to Jesus To A Child and Cowboys And Angels. In both of these, Michael's voice is as smooth as hot cocoa on a wintery day. Light the candles, set a table for two, bring out the champagne bucket and allow the music to melt your everyday cares away. George Michaels is amazing!
B00014TJ7K|5.0|After braving critical slings and arrows over his last release &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;, George returned full force with his second best solo album &quot;Cloud 9&quot;. His last number 1 as a solo artist features some of his most dynamic and commerical music. &quot;Cloud 9&quot; kicks off the album in fine form with nice guitar playing by Harrison and Clapton. The real gem on the album for me, though, is &quot;That's What it Takes&quot; written with Jeff Lynne and Gary Wright. It's got a marvelous melody (one of the catchiest he ever wrote). &quot;Fish on the Sand&quot; continues the streak of winning songs. &quot;Just For Today&quot; has a lovely minor key melody and nice guitar break from George but has never appealed to me.<br />The funny &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; provides us George's perspective on The Beatle years in humorous fashion. The witty production touches include references to Harrison's &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, John's &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and a nice outro that refers to Harrison's &quot;Within You, Without You&quot;. &quot;Devil's Radio&quot; provides George with a witty opportunity to focus on the gossip orientated world we live in. The album concludes with the marvelous remake of Rudy Clark's &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; which became a surprise hit on both radio and MTV.<br />The two bonus tracks from &quot;Shaghai surprise&quot; aren't quite up to the standards of the best material here but the production makes them sound like they fit in. Personally, I would have preferred to see more demos, outtakes and the other three songs from the film but, well, that's not to be.<br />The remastered sound allows &quot;Cloud 9&quot; to take a major step up and compare well with George's remastered &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. The packaging includes commentary from Harrison from an interview on the creation of the album and includes photos although no song lyrics.<br />&quot;Cloud 9&quot; is one of George's three or four essential solo albums.f George's three or four essential solo albums.
0156027321|1.0|I am in search of the time that I lost reading this overrated novel. It was juvenile, puerile, and shallow.<br />BUT, it has one redeeming feature: by reading, and thereby suffering through this awful bore, you can REALLY appreciate great literature!! This book only challenges you to finish it, much as dinner at a bad restaurant tempts you to leave, or eat the bad food.
B00014TJ6Q|4.0|Suffused with a mellow 70's vibe, \\"George Harrison\\" catches you in the wake of melody and leaves you floating along with a warm feeling when its finished. Although it didn't hit the same highs as Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" or \\"Cloud 9\\", \\"George Harrison coasts along on its own folksy charm.<br />The opening track with Steve Windwood's characteristic sythesizer part became a deserved hit single for George although it didn't quite break through the way Harrison's \\"Blow Away\\" did. Both songs share strong performances and memorable melodies that capture your attention immediately. Harrison's guitar playing here reflects his contented life after his new marriage.<br />\\"Here Comes the Moon\\" doesn't quite capture the fire or originality of its sister song but the low-key atmosphere, arrangement and melody make it memorable. The soft-rock minor classic \\"Faster\\" chronicles George's interest in Formula 1 racing and provides a snapshot of the racer's life.  \\"Soft Touch\\", \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" and beautiful \\"Your Love is Forever\\" are a trio of great songs written by George in praise of his ladylove. \\"Your Love is Forever\\" features one of the most beautiful melodies Harrison had written outside of \\"Something\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"The Inner Light\\".<br />The original album closed with the Harrison-Gary Wright collaboration \\"If you Believe\\" a marvelous look at faith and inner strength. The CD reissue features one bonus track the original demo for \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" which, although not essential, will be of particular interest to Harrison fans.<br />The 12 page booklet mimics the original inner sleeve and cover with lyrics, credits and lyrics for the various songs.

B000127LW2|4.0|Voyager recaptured the spirit of The Original Series with its setting in the unexplored part of the galaxy. In the pilot episode we're introduced to Kathyrn Janeway the Captain of the Voyager as she attempts to locate her Security Officer Tuvok. It seems Tuvok was working undercover with the Marqui a rebel group of homesteaders that are trying to preserve their settlements. The Federation has turned the planets the Marqui have settled over to another alien species as part of a treaty.<br />Tuvok disappeared along with the crew he was spying on. Janeway recruits convict and former Marqui/Starfleet Officer Tom Paris to help her locate Tuvok. When they enter the distorted and unstable space called the Badlands (where the Marqui frequently hide), Voyager is hit by an energy wave that carries her 70,000 light years from home--essentially across the galaxy to unexplored space. They are transported against their will to what appears to a celebration at a farmhouse on Earth circa 1930. The mystery continues to deepen as the inhabitants are clearly hiding something or someone.<br />The beginning of Voyager's pilot episode sparkles with conflict, adventure and energy. In many respects, Voyager recalls The tone and purpose of The Original Series with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley. The stories still simmer with political overtones and adventure but with a much different background than Next Generation or DS9. The capable cast more delivers particularly Kate Mulgrew as Janeway and Robert Picardo as the irritable Emergency Medical Hologram.<br />Yes, there were some minor characters that were a bit irritating and didn't quite fit in with the rest of the cast but, well, you try and work out the kinks during the first season. On the whole, the writing is uniformly strong.<br />The handsome transfer suffers from few blemishes. There's some digital artifacts noticeable particularly during the optical effects (in the form of edge enhancement)but that's not really all that distracting. The lively colors and set design along with the sharp direction (particularly in the pilot episode)make even the so-so written episodes worth watching.<br />I do have two complaints one minor and one major. The boxed set is priced the same as the full seasons for Next Generation and DS9 but there's only the first fifteen episodes of season one included (amazon.com is incorrect about there being sixteen as the pilot was broadcast as a two hour episode). This should have been price at considerably less than it is based on the total episodes and extras included.<br />My second complaint is regarding the packaging. Next Generation's bulky boxes were admittedly a bit large but they did protect the discs and were very nicely designed. DS9's sets streamlined the process replacing the box with a plastic, thin slimcase which sat better on the shelf with other DVDs and sets. Voyager looks cheap. The plastic containter has a single illustration of the ship on the front and the rest is made up of thin plastic. The box is split in the middle and you must pull it apart to get to the discs themselves. They are housed in an orange plastic container similar to DS9's clear ones. They seem less sturdy although they probably aren't. Still the slipcase looks cheap and the series (and fans) deserve much better particularly when you're paying as much as the other Trek sets.<br />There are some nice extras to be had including most of the footage shot with Genevieve Bujold as Janeway for the pilot episode. There's also an assembly edit of one particular unfinished section from the pilot before Bujold and the Trek team decided to part company. Berman's politically correct comments don't dish any dirt. While Bujold is fine as Janeway, she doesn't carry the authority of Mulgrew and is a bit of a disappointment in the role.<br />The other extras include a visual effects featurette; original interviews produced during the series run with various cast members; a look at the creation and content forthe Voyager website; a location featurette on the Kazons; Andre Bormanis the science consultant and one of the writers discusses the incorporation of real space phenomena and theories; archival footage of Kate Mulgrew discussing her role as Janeway and a new featurtette focusing on creating the new series with pilot episode co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Pillar and Jeri Taylor discussing the various challenges they faced.  There's also a photo gallery included.<br />The sound is spectacular and available for the first time in 5.1 Surround although it isn't used quite as well as a theatrical feature might have.<br />The Voyager boxed set isn't disappointing--many of the best episodes deserve 5 stars and the featurettes are also quite good as well. The sound is a stand out as is the transfer despite some minor blemishes. It'll make a good addition to a fan's collection. I only wish that Paramount had given fans a sturdier box for the film and one that didn't look so cheap.r the Voyager website; a location featurette on the Kazons; Andre Bormanis the science consultant and one of the writers discusses the incorporation of real space phenomena and theories; archival footage of Kate Mulgrew discussing her role as Janeway and a new featurtette focusing on creating the new series with pilot episode co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Pillar and Jeri Taylor discussing the various challenges they faced.

078322608X|4.0|\\"Brazil\\" is the other one. \\"12 Monkeys\\" is a perfect example of the creative talent of the director Terry Gilliam, not only he is a gifted comedian, he is also a great science fiction director. In \\"12 Monkeys\\" we can see big doses of black humor and social satire. The movie works as some kind of fable with a tragic ending.<br />The 3 main members of the cast gave one of their finest performances in this movie: Bruce Willis as the enigmatic James Cole, few times he has been as good as he was in \\"12 Monkeys\\". Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly gave balance and subtlety to this dark story. Brad Pitt as the insane Jeffrey Goines gave a touch of black comedy to the movie with his frantic performance.<br />The soundtrack has very, very good tracks like the beautiful \\"What A Wonderful World\\", performed by Louie Armstrong, the melancholic \\"Sleepwalk\\", performed by Santo &amp; Johnny, or the mysterious tango rhythm of the main theme in \\"12 Monkeys\\". Without a doubt, most of the songs go along with the spirit of the movie.<br />\\"12 Monkeys\\" is one of the best sci-fi films of the 1990s. A very recommendable movie.
0385510438|3.0|This novel is sort of a combination of a two different novels, one about a trial, and nine years later.  It is definitely typical of later Grisham.  Predictable, short, but readable.  <br />Grisham describes the life of a young man who moves to the south and buys a small county newspaper.  The first part deals with a trial of a gruesome murder.  The second part deals with a mysterious killer (though who the real killer is insultingly obvious).  Along with it, Grisham uses this story to weave in other stories about racial integration,  southern style, and families.<br />There is nothing wrong with this book except for the fact that it tries to be all in one and doesn't go into any great depth.  Is it a thriller, a social commentary piece, or a law book?  It tries to be all three and the result is very ho hum.<br />Definitely better than \\"The Street Lawyer\\" or \\"King of Torts\\".  Doesn't reach the heights of \\"The Chamber\\" or \\"A Painted House.\\"<br />It's a decent read, but very mundane.
B0000U0X1G|4.0|Clark Johnson has taken a mediocre old t.v. series and turned it into an above average actioner.  S.W.A.T. suffers most when it goes through it's &quot;let's see who makes the team&quot; moves, but once it kicks in, it's a high octane action flick.  Some thoughts to consider:<br />*Is anyone else getting tired of movies being &quot;promotional soundtracks&quot;?  There's so much junk music interjected in this movie and one knows it was put there to attract the teenies and sell records.  It's a total distraction in this movie; what ever happened to good old fashioned musical scores that complemented the movie rather than make you want to turn the volume down?<br />*Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Larry Poindexter, Barry Van Horn, Jeremy Renner, and Olivier Martinez, all did great jobs in their underwritten roles, but Josh Charles didn't quite have the strength to pull off his &quot;surprise&quot; twist.<br />*The plane landing on the bridge was pretty original and exciting.<br />*This is not a great movie, but it's an entertaining one!!!
B000077VR3|1.0|This was, in my opinion, another of those unreasonably hyped films and this holds especially for Indian audiences who are already used to and saturated with the entire concept of a song-n-dance extravaganza taking the place of narrative.<BR>The visuals are impressive, no doubt; the huge sets are awash in eye-candy and the camera's numerous swoops and pans take your breath away...for the first 10 minutes. After this you realize that the film is moving in a kind of loop with the same cycle of shots trying to claim your attention for its entire duration. There's just so much you can appreciate of popular songs being woven (in frequently mangled form) to fit into the groove of this musical. The film misses the tremendous cinematic value of contrast between the reality of Parisian street-life and the glitzy illusions of its music halls. The performances are pretty much of the cardboard n' candy-floss variety trademarked by ye typical Hollywood studio romance flick. Nicole Kidman is irritatingly out-of-place and Ewan MacGregor appears to have completely discarded his Trainspotting roots. Supporting characters are uniformly ridiculous, with John Leguziamo asking to be strangled with barbed wire for his clumsy portrayal of Toulouse Lauterec, the sensitive artist whose illustrations were in no small way responsible for the fame of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Jim Broadbent as the freaked out owner Lidler is good in an over-the-top way for some of the scenes.<BR>Even 'William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet', never in itself a great film scores higher on my list than this self-indulgent tripe. Pass me another aspirin.

B00006IUL7|2.0|I must say I'm rather disappointed by what seems to be a typical Hollywood &quot;give `em a bigger budget and dumb `em down&quot; treatment of new talents like Nolan. This film, a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film, is quite clearly a mainstream studio product and a waste of a rather promising idea.<br />***May contain SPOILERS***<br />The plot begins with the arrival of a pair of Homicide detectives in an Alaskan town to solve the murder of a local girl. Pacino plays the older cop Dormer who rendered insomniac in the perpetual sunlight of the season. An early lead into the killer's whereabouts leads to a stakeout at a cabin hideaway - a treacherous fog befuddles sight and Dormer ends up shooting his partner, apparently by accident. He places the blame on the escaped killer and the investigations are continued. Dormer has the guilt of his partner's death to compound his insomnia and another person knows the truth of the incident - the killer, who has seen Dormer fire the fatal shot. A cat-and-mouse game ensues between the two, with Dormer alternating between hunting down the murderer and covering up his own tracks, while the killer (Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a pulp writer) aims to psyche Dormer into letting him escape - the two end up working out a deal where a third person is framed for the crime. But things go awry in this setup and the film abruptly makes towards a (silly) shootout climax in which Dormer and Finch gun each other down.<BR>The main problem IMO with this film is that it gives off a thorough sense of `under-achievement' in every aspect of it. There were a thousand ways little and big in which the visual and emotional core of the film could have been imbued with substance but really all that seems to have fallen by the wayside if at all considered.<BR>1. The look of most of the film is so utterly generic it's disheartening. The aspect of a sparsely populated settlement who live a season of perpetual sunlight is dealt with in a perfunctory manner that sucks away most of the uniqueness of the film. This should have been a focal point that defined the sensibility and emotional core of the film and it was just thrown off as a two-scene gimmick reference. The entire concept of `light-as-darkness' blinding and disorienting Dormer's character is never approached to an extent worth the mention. Without that really what was the point of shooting the film in Alaska - to show that Alaska's cranky teens and crazy killers were like those in any other part of the country?<BR>2. Pacino seems to have been selected for the role of the haggard Dormer simply because his entire current career seems veered towards playing haggard old men. This is not to say that he does a bad job, he gets pretty effective in some of the scenes that come immediately after the partner's killing but really at very few points does one feel the turmoil and disorientation of Dormer and there are a few bits of sleepwalk acting even for an insomniac character.<BR>3. Robin William's writer-killer character is again a stereotype that has been seen in umpteen movies made before. I really wish they had taken pains over giving his character a different edge - But we're still stuck with the generic loony-killer.<BR>4. The clean-cut rookie cop who's a fan of Dormer (Hilary Swank) seems like a throwaway character although one does not fault Swank's performance. The film would have been tighter in the absence of such extraneous parts.<BR>5. The film lacks any real sophistication relying on cheap `oooh blood' shots to appear edgy.<BR>6. The climax is a total no-brainer. I'm informed that the Norwegian original ends on a morally ambiguous note with the cop getting away with his escapade. Hollywood of course shies away from such subtleties and we're subjected to a pointless gun-battle in the aftermath of which a dying Dormer advises Swank to not `lose her way (towards truth, justice and the American way, one supposes)'

B00018TI5E|5.0|The latest album from John Frusciante is also his most refined.  Previous works by Frusciante have at least partially been composed in his house, recorded and presumably mixed on a simple four track recorder.  However, those products have been the basis for a loyal following of hardcore fans.<br />Those fans may give this album mixed reviews.  There is no doubt, however, that the mainstream music press, and probably mainstream music listeners, will like this album more than his older stuff.<br />Other musicians performing on this album include fellow chili pepper band mates Chad Smith and Flea; as well as the young and talented Bicycle Thief multi-instrumentalist, Josh Klinghoffer - a friend and collaborator of Frusciante.<br />The album booklet is nice - with photos by Vincent Gallo (the musician/actor/director/writer/artist/model/architect/motorcycle racer, and now photographer) and complete lyrics.  This is something of a change for JF, as some of his previous albums have somewhat unintelligible lyrics - mainly because he used his voice as more of an instrument than a delivery method for poetry.<br />On this album there is a mix of classic pop songs, experimental music, and deep meaningful tunes.  Frusciante has honed his songwriting chops, along with his production skills.  In the end, it's just another great album for fans to add to their repertoire.<br />Don't buy this in the hope that it will be a chili pepper album.  The music is more experimental, but every bit as good.  This album would be great for anyone looking for unique music that isn't restricted by motivations other than pure art.

Each song is simply more magical than the next, each one featuring Aguilera's unparalleled, amazingly strong and beautiful vocals.  Stripped proves that there are angels on earth because Aguilera truly has the voice of an angel!  A must buy for anyone who appreciates talented female vocalists!

Unlike The strokes and The Hives, etc, Jet doesn't just bring a new style of music, they bring BACK the glory days of The Who, the Stones, and The Beatles, while also adding in treats like great acoustic songs and amazing rock-out songs.  Here is a brief overview of each song, with ratings alongside them:<BR>1.Last Chance-(4/5)Great opening song, gets you pumped for the rest of the album.<BR>2.Are you gonna be my girl?-(5/5)The song most people will buy the album for, agreat song centered around one basic riff, rock at its best.<BR>3.Rollover D.J.-(4/5)Loud, fast, catchy lyrics, you'll never forget this one.<BR>4.Look what you've Done-(5/5)One of my favorite songs on the album, a great slow piano song that gets a little faster at times but sticks to the piano and soothing voice of the singer. Reminds me of the Beatles' Let it Be.<BR>5.Get what you Need-(4/5)Brings the CD back to its loud, fast pace(and thats a good thing, a very good thing)<BR>6.Move on-(5/5)A slow acoustic song which one again benefits due to the awesome vocals.<BR>7.Radio Song-(4/5)A stadium-worthy power ballad that keeps it slow but interesting<BR>8.Get me outta here-(5/5)Amazing song that you just want to crank up and yell the words.<BR>9.Cold hard B****-(5/5)GREAT song with a catchy chorus<BR>10.Come Around Again--(5/5)Another great acoustic song, jet does acoustic just as good if not better than electric rock<BR>11.Take it or Leave it-(4/5)Jets first big song, pretty good-a breath of loudness in the slow songs of the albums end<BR>12.Lazy Gun-(4/5) Jet+acoustics=amazing<BR>13.Timothy-(5/5) One hell of a closing song.<br />I picked up this CD when i saw it for 10 bucks and figured i liked are you gonna be my girl so i bought it. In 2 days i had forgotten all about the single and was engrossed in the rest of this amazing album. Do yourself a favor and pick up this one, you won't be disappointed
1573229725|3.0|I felt compelled to write a review of this book because I think it is highly overrated.  Sarah Waters gets the feel of the period occasionally, but one is never in doubt that one is reading a contemporary novel that somehow rings false.  It often felt like a Dickensian rip-off; many of the characters and their situations reminding me of similar ones in Dickens' work -- so much so, that the ending was quite predictable.<br /><br />The writing conventions are rather obvious as well.  Sue's story is told in the past tense, Maud's in the present, although the voices are not that distinct.  A few slang expressions and grammatical errors are thrown in for Maud to show she was raised by thieves, but this voice becomes blurred towards the end of the novel.<br /><br />Basically this is a potboiler for lovers of Victoriana.  Read Wilkie Collins \\"Armadale\\" for a real adventure.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I picked up Gavin's album because he was opening for some other band and I had never heard his music...You could call this a Fortunate Accident. I have fallen in love with his style...the piano being his primary translation of his thoughts and feelings to the world, followed by his fun guitar action. It is incredibley refreshing to have an album you can relate to every song and feel that roller-coaster range of emotions that Gavin DeGraw takes you on. The lyrics of &quot;Meaning&quot; and &quot;Over-rated&quot; are amazing and I find &quot;Chariot&quot; to be such a positive and inspiring song. My favorites are &quot;Just Friends&quot; and (I am obsessed with) &quot;Belief&quot;. The album is awesome...so great, I give it to friends for their birthdays and gave a copy to family members for the holidays. It gets better too, if you have the chance to see him live, please go, for your sake. Watch this performer bring the album to life with his energy, stage presence and unique voice.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This film presents an ill-informed, naive, even racist view of Japan.  The two lead actors are great and the cinematography is lovely, but it is also full of ugly age-old stereotypes.  The two short jokes -- in the elevator and in the shower -- are cheap shots.  I'm Japanese and 5'11&quot; and was insulted.  And I know the adjustable shower head was purposely lowered.  The filmmaker pretends that no one in Japan understands English, despite the fact that most people born after World War II know enough English to know when they were being mocked by two foreigners in a sushi bar.  The film follows the tired &quot;aren't the Japanese weird&quot; line that first-time visitors love to mine for a few laughs.  I guess that's the disappointing thing about the movie's popularity, how many educated, well-travelled, liberal thinking people love it.  Several Japanese people have defended the film as well, but that's not surprising.  Japanese are adverse to openly critizing others, especially when that person has been a guest in their home or country.  Japanese are, for the most part, a very polite people.  Apparently, that's a weakness or at least something to exploit.  Sofia Coppola seems like a polite person too.  But she is so sheltered by privilege, pedigree and hipness that no one dare call her a racist.  Or, maybe she's not.  Maybe she's just saying that the best thing to do when you don't understand something is to make fun of it.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie isn't intended to be a feel-good movie.  It is intended to provoke us to think about loneliness.  IT IS A COMMENTARY ON THE SEPARATION THAT EXISTS IN A POST-MODERN WORLD FROM A DIRECTOR WHO IS THOROUGHLY POST-MODERN IN HER WORLD-VIEW.<br />We've seen this before, many times, from Woody Allen.  But Allen's movies, particularly his classics &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and later works such as &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, contain characters that are relatable.  Somehow, we care about them, or are at least interested in the outcome of the plot.  I REVISIT WOODY ALLEN'S BEST MOVIES EVERY FEW YEARS.  I DON'T THINK THAT I'LL EVER GO BACK TO THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS WELL-DIRECTED AND WELL-ACTED.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.<br />While the acting performances are fine in Lost in Translation, and many of the situations are humerous, the characters are not endearing.  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LONELY THAT THEY'RE JUST BLAH.  For instance, it is a thoroughly appropriate reflection of Copolla's post-modern philosophy that the characters not end up together at the end of the movie.  But the characters are so boring that I didn't care one way or the other.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Hey. I just wanted to say that Kanye did his job. He spoke through his heart and soul on this one. The only flaw that i found in this cd is that there are way way way to many skits. The last song is 12 minutes and 50 seconds. The first 3 minutes of the song he raps, and for the rest of the &quot;song&quot;, he just talks about how he got a record deal and everything. I still love this cd, but I'd like to hear him just rap and sing a whole album. My 5 favorite tracks on the album are:<br />     1. Family Business<BR>     2. Slow Jamz(new version)<BR>     3. All Falls Down-feat. Syleena Johnson<BR>     4. Get Em High-feat. Talib Kweli ad Common<BR>     5. Jesus Walks<BR>     (I also like &quot;Through the Wire&quot;...who doesn't)<br />GO GET THIS CD. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST OUT ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.
6301872312|5.0|Contrary to someothers reviews, this is a REAL Life Adventure with real life experiences.  At points it is not pretty, but if you are considering a Sheep Hunt this video will prepare you for it.<br />An Honest Real Life Adventure ... maybe not for the kiddies!
0793563836|5.0|I got this for my 11 year old son.  He has been playing acoustic and electric for about a year using the Hal Leonard Guitar Method Books 1-3 which he enjoyed.  Now he wants to learn bass too, so naturally we looked at the Bass Method book.  This book is great for a beginner.  It starts out simple with lots of good exercises for each string and gradually gets more complicated.  <br />We use Hal Leonard for a basic foundation.  He works with his teacher and they combine this book with whatever other music he wants to play such as \\"Learn to Play Bass with Metallica\\" or his favorite CD's.  I looked at other bass books but felt that this was the best for beginners.  Also, do yourself a favor and get a metronome if you want to play bass!
B000001EEN|5.0|I completely agree with another reviewer - very, very underrated. I first purchased Rainbow over 15 years ago, as a cassette with very poor recording. Then some years later I purchased another copy with better recording, but still the truncated version. This CD was heaven-sent. Its always great to hear Real artists belting out no-nonsense stuff - and What A Lineup This Was!! I just wish someone decides to release it in its entirety - something like The Rock 'n Roll Circus of The Stones - with all the songs, all the talk, and all the fun!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|IF YOU DIG BILL YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS. HE IS HILARIOUS.<BR>NATURAL, ADLIB TYPE STUFF. AWESOME.
B00005JLWN|5.0|ever since the matrix came out, anyone who wears long black coats and has gunfights is obviously trying to copy off that movie. no one seems to mention that the look of the Matrix is strikingly similar to the likes of the Crow and the first Blade movie, or that the idea that this world is not the real world was nicked from Jean Beaudrillard. No offence, the Matrix movies were good, but they are hardly the most original concept in the world.<br />Neither is Equilibrium, but that is part of what's cool about it. right througout the movie, you can see that director Kurt Wimmer loves movies like Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and Logan's Run, and has taken elements from them to create a universe which, if you think about it, is not all that impossible. so in essence, it has done the same as thing as the Matrix, but it could not be more different.<br />to begin with, the action is so different. whereas the Wachowskis action scenes were kung fu and gunfights slowed down, Equilibrium puts the two together with the fantastically high concept gun-kata, and uses it in tight little symmetrical bursts of violence that really grab the attention. the climax where John Preston (Christian Bale) goes to kill the main villain is an assault on the senses, and the prelude to the final fight adds in some unexpected but much appreciated gore to the mix.<br />The performances are great, with Bale kung fu kicking Keanu Reeves to death in the acting stakes. He is abley supported by Taye Diggs, whose smirking evil henchman is the perfect contrast to Bale's more emotional performance. Emily Watson is underused as the love interest and there is some great support from Sean Bean and Angus MacFadyen, and Wimmer keeps the pace going while adding some nice touches and unknowing references to other classic films (the Beethoven 9th from Clockwork Orange)<br />unfortunately because of the monster success of the Matrix, this was found to be playing second fiddle in theaters (it wasn't really released in mine),but it is a more than equal to the first Matrix, and is actually better in parts than the sequels. watch this before you take your Prozium shot and be moved by a rockin piece of action cinema.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It sure is good to climb in to my time machine, sit back and get sent all the way back to a time when television was meant to be fun and entertaining. <BR>This production is truly 1st class. As a graphic artist I can only imagine what fun the designers must have had in putting the packaging together. Creative! Strong layout! I'm jealous big time. <BR>As a whole some one thought this entire thing out. This collection is put together solid and I am more than jazzed with the fact it was released as a complete season with the pilot movie. I loved the 1st season the best. I still remember the first time I saw the movie. I thought, \\"these two dudes are so cool!\\". Even though I was only about 12 or so I remember thinking this show was some how different. That it was special. <BR>The access menus are enhanced by the best theme song of all 4 seasons. I could never figure out why they changed it. Lalo Shiffrin's work is mememorable, pure classic 70's t.v and movie sountrack. Although he is only given credit for the theme song I can catch hints of Enter the Dragon type pieces throughout the entire show. I'm not sure how decisions are made when it comes to putting these collections together but it seems to me that all the right ones were made here. The special features are too few but at least they exist. I like them all except the upcoming movie tie in. I think that it will eventually detract from the collection if the film ends being a flop. I do like the fact that both David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser are actually shown interacting with their movie versions. How often do you get to see that? My favorite feature is found on disc 5; the featurette called \\"Harder than it looks\\"; classic, \\"don't take TV too serious\\" type bloopers, with a twist. To tell the truth there were a lot more bloopers that could have been added to the feature, I caught a few myself. But, I don't think that these bloopers make the show bad or detract from it. Times were different back then. Television was innocent. It wasn't all wrapped up in technical advisors and stuff like that. Television and movies nowadays have it made. With all the technological advancements that have been made in equipment, production and special effects. With the amount of knowledge available today actors nowadays have all of this technical and tactical training available to play a part but many times the one thing that lacks is the ability to act. Too much is spent on flash and not enough on substance. Starsky and Hutch was a show unto itself. After sitting through all 23 episodes I still feel the connection with the characters, even after all these years. Like I know them and I guess that is what attracted me to the show back then. The acting was very solid. The characters original. Raw and edgy, funny and real, not just another copy of a copy.It was a show that shaped a generation. Not the other way around.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This movie has a great premise. vampires versus werewolves in an all out war for supremacy. fighting fang and claw... Oh wait they're not, they're using guns and wearing long black coats. sound familiar?<br />The main problem with this movie is that director Len Wiseman has stupidly decided to forget about all the old mystical roots of werewolves and vampires in favour of copying popular action movies like Blade and The Matrix. The performances are adequate enough and the action is watchable, though not very original. the art direction is good and Kate Beckinsale in a catsuit is always worth a look, but it could have been so much better. if you want a more original horror action movie check out Brotherhood of the Wolf or Blade.
B00004U8H4|4.0|Before everyone jumps and yells what do I mean by beautiful no not the violence but the music and the acting and the way the movie is shot. The reason for 4 is that like many critics this film trys to be many things but the people who say that it is trying to be a slasher are tottally wrong and probly rented the movie for the violence or dont read between lines or reels. Is it a social satire yes on the 80's Matiralism or \\"me\\" genration etc. The odd thing is that the 2 min they cut out (a scene in which patrick looks at himself during a sex act) is more evidence what the movie is trying to say Patrick is so crazy that all he can think about is him his things and what people think about him. To get a better perspective read the book which in itself is more sexual and more violent then this movie could ever be but all those action explain who patrick is not what he does. Yes there are better way better films but if your looking for something weird, (but not out there) and new buy the movie, but if you like the movie for what it says pick up the book since in many ways is totally differint but still has the same message.
B00005JLXE|4.0|the first two batman movies were really good. the third one was passable. Batman and Robin...?<br />if that movie had been made like Daredevil, we could have all been spared a lot pain and disappointment. <br />first off, the casting is spot on, especially Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan in the bad guy roles. Ben Affleck plays the Daredevil character well and makes a decent fist of the action, though he is at times outdone by Jennifer Garner. <BR>The fight scenes are well choreographed, taking a few tips from the Matrix, and the special effects are good.<br />The main thing is the story. if the people behind the last Batman movie had gone for a simple revenge story like this, the movie could have been a lot better. <br />my reason for constantly comparing this to Batman is that the only main problem with Daredevil is it strives way too much to be &quot;Marvel Comics Batman&quot; with the rain soaked look, the moral conundrum about good and bad and the secret room with costumes and weapons. it doesn't stop it from being one of the best comic book movies of the past two years (definitely on a par with Spider Man) but you can't help but feel the memory of the Batman movies gnawing at the back of your mind.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|i first heard &quot;are you gonna be my girl&quot; in the ipod commercial, and immediately looked up who sings it online. i saw that it was jet, and then proceeded to buy their cd. that is how fast i decided that their music is great, and u will too.
0385720920|3.0|10/19/12- UPDATE to review below-  WOW! What a difference 8 years makes!! I now not only consider myself a HUGE Chuck fan, but I own this as well as every other book he's published.  I just bought the Invisible Monsters Remixed and I CAN'T wait to read it!!!!!! I highly recommend this book along with all the others so definitely don't listen to the girl I used to be below ;)<br /><br />With an interesting writer on your hands, you know you will be dealing with a very interesting book.  Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Choke\\" was a funny book from the very fist page.  It made me laugh-out-loud during most of the parts, even though some of it was quite confusing.  Like others probably have said, there is a lack of climax, which I was longing for, but it will all make sense in the end.  All of Palahniuk's book are odd, so this being my first book by the author, I am wondering what the rest of his books are like.  Unfortunatly, the book didn't entertain me the whole time, even though it did make me laugh.  I would have to say that parts of the book were awesome, while others literally made me fall asleep in seconds.  I did not buy the book, and I probably won't ever.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Season One of Gilmore Girls was absolutely perfection. Amy found the balance between quirky, witty, touching, sad, angry, you name it. The characters, unlike the recent seasons, were not cartoons, but actually believable. This season, by far, has the best episodes as well. Rory's Birthday Parties: utterly and completely perfect. The acting and writing were at its best in this episode. Nothing else compares to the scene when Lorelai recalls Rory's delivery, or when Emily sees Lorelai's room for the first time.<br />Buy the DVD. There's no doubt about it. These episodes are worth the price and then some.<br />But make sure you don't buy as many of the next season.<br />We wouldn't want the WB to waste any of their precious money they now seem to lack so much of on those dreadful Season 3 episodes... or God forbid.. Season 4!
6304779356|5.0|THE LOST BOYS is one of those nostalgic films that came out while I was in high school.  It was refreshing to sit thru it recently as it had been so long since I saw it the 1st time around.<br />The movie features a very young Keifer Sutherland and Jason Patrick as well as an ultra-young Corey Haim &amp; Corey Feldman.  I do believe this was the 1st movie Haim &amp; Feldman made together, and was one of the very 1st that Sutherland made.<br />If you like the horror / comedy genre, this is one of the films that pioneered that field.  It doesn't go so far as slapstick (like the horrendous latter NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies) but does retain a certain macabre charm.  The vampire element is handled well, always being a backdrop but never becoming too overwhelming to the comedic aspect of the film.<br />One of the differences between LOST BOYS and other vampire flicks is that we never learn how old the vampires are.  Typically, we see a middle aged person, find out he / she is a vampire &amp; then learn that he / she is 600 years old.  While they do mention the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, they never divulge that they were actually THERE during the quake.<br />If you like vampire flicks, THE LOST BOYS is for you.  It's one of the better ones I've ever seen, and is also bereft of the standard gun-blazing vampire movies of recent times.  LOST BOYS is fun, nostalgic &amp; it's strange.  Even after all these years it's still eerie to hear the youth choir sing the Ten Commandments to a New Age melody...
B000002G87|5.0|This album is fantastic in every way and even has sentimental value for me. Duane Allman died a day before my birth that same year, 1971. Suffice it to say, I haven't stopped listening to Layla since high school. This is a historic album in many ways, but it's just great music by any standard. It's the first and only album I know of where Eric Clapton is sharing lead guitar duties with another player of equal ability. The sound of Clapton's lead guitar against Allman's blistering slide is heavenly. They were just meant to play forever, and they almost do on some tracks which last at least ten minutes long. Hands down the best jam music you will ever hear. The irony is that &quot;Layla&quot; represents least the tone of the whole album which is a kind of southern-rock-blues jam. They also take turns singing which is just as almost as good as the guitars. If you have only heard the song Layla on this album, then you are missing out on a serious musical beauty.
B0000UJL96|4.0|I agree with other reviewers regarding the quality control of this DVD packaging. No printed insert, the absurd second-disc label -- what were they thinking? A picture of a different Enterprise? From a DIFFERENT MOVIE? Printed UPSIDE DOWN? Are you KIDDING? Didn't they think that we STAR TREK fans, the most nit-picky, obsessive, detail-oriented folks on the planet, would notice? (Maybe they thought we'd see it as the Excelsior and not notice the difference. Yeah, right. On a related note, the picture of spacedock on the first disc looks like it's from &quot;Star Trek III&quot;). And for some reason, mine came in a WHITE case, which looks a little ridiculous lined up with all the other ST: TOS movies I have (all but V, of course) in black cases. Ugh. Shame on Paramount.<br />To answer another reviewer's question, the film was shot in Super 35, hence the 16:9 aspect ratio here adding info on the top and bottom, not cutting off at the sides, so rest easy.<br />Oh, the movie and DVD program are great.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I didn't go in expecting it to be a life altering experience, I went to see it to be entertained.  And entertained I was!<br />Jack is playing....well Jack.  He is good at playing Jack.  But he was not the best thing about the film by any means.  <br />Diane Keaton was wonderful.  She would just light up the screen and is such a natural.<br />I wish Frances McDormand was in the film longer, loved her character.<br />But the absolute surprise for me was Keanu Reeves.  I thought he was wonderful in this film.  Maybe he is starting to loosen up and go with the flow more now he is getting older, but never really being a fan of his at all (ok I loved Speed ;) ) I have changed my mind after seeing him in this.<br />Can't wait for it to be released on DVD here in Australia, definately one for my collection!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I originally read the book and thought it was very good, so when I heard about the musical I bought the soundtrack.  I was so impressed that I am taking a  weekend trip to New York for the sole purpose of seeing the show...and I live in California.
B000002UAC|5.0|This is the Beatles second album.  While it's not quite as good as their [[ASIN:B0025KVLRO first album]], it's still a classic in it's own right.  Somewhat surprisingly, there were no singles released from this album.  But many of the songs have still managed to become classics, like \\"It Won't Be Long\\" and \\"All My Loving\\".  In many respects, this album follows a similar \\"formula\\" as the Beatles first album.  Both feature 8 Beatles originals and 6 covers.  Both have a show tune sung by Paul.  Both albums end with a fast rocker sung by John.  But this album features George's first songwriting contribution.  And it also features some of their best cover songs, especially the Motown songs (\\"Please Mister Postman\\" and \\"You Really Got a Hold on Me\\").  This album is a must buy for all Beatlemaniacs everywhere.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This album is a pretty solid album, exceptional compared all the garbage we hear on the radio today.  There are a few weak tracks, but the majority of the them are sick.  All the beats are hot, and Kanye's lyrics are a lot better than I expected.  The album has a lot of great guest appearances, including Jay-Z and J. Ivy's sick verse on &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; and Common's amazing rhyme patterns on &quot;Get Em High&quot;.  However, there are too many skits on the album, many of them dissing college, which I currently attend.  Overall though, the album is innovative and excellent for today's standards and is definately worth buying.  Favorite tracks:  Jesus Walks, Get Em High, Never Let Me Down, Two Words, School Spirit
B000065V9Y|3.0|This album is better than most, but for my money the live versions on Secret World are better. They are a little more lively and energetic.
B00015HVI8|5.0|this is the absolute best series ever especially for people who enjoy fantasy, comedy, action, sci fi, and adventure. I could sit and watch this series all day long.
0440237688|4.0|This book is probably one of the best in its genre. It provides such an amazing storyline and settings of a perfect society but with no feelings, memories, differences, or even colors. The society was erased of memories, feelings, differences, and colors to ensure an society of no crimes, dangers, and horrors. A society where everyone shall come together as one with no complaint, worries, or facing any problems/dangers. But this wasn't the right society, the way of life the world was built up to be. To have peace is to have war, to have good is to have evil, and to be happy is to be sad. The world can't be perfect without mistakes to allow the term of perfection occurs. Jonas, a boy born different than others and who was able to see the world with colors, saw the same purpose. At the age of 12, where kids of age 12 must be sent off to jobs, he was sent to The Giver... And the story of the true perfect human, Jonas, begins...
B000002KBU|4.0|THIS IS IT: MOSTLY, WHEN YOU MENTION JONI MITCHELL, THIS, WITHOUT QUESTION, IS MOST LIKELY THE FIRST ALBUM THAT'LL POP INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS (ALONG WITH THE EQUALLY CLASSIC COURT AND SPARK ALBUM). THESE SONGS ARE WITHOUT DOUBT, NOTHING SHORT OF RAW EMOTION AND BEAUTY (AS CORNY AS THAT MAY SOUND TO SOME). THIS EMOTION IS AMPLY DISPLAYED ON SONGS LIKE &quot;ALL I WANT&quot;, &quot;LITTLE GREEN, THE TITLE SONG, &quot;RIVER&quot;, AND &quot;THE LAST TIME I SAW RICHARD&quot;. SOME SONGS CAN BE SAD AND JOYFUL AT THE SAME TIME (&quot;CAREY&quot;)OR JUST DOWNRIGHT SAD (&quot;BLUE&quot;, &quot;LITTLE GREEN&quot;, WHICH IS ABOUT THE DAUGHTER SHE GAVE UP FOR ADOPTION WHEN SHE WAS 19, AND &quot;RIVER&quot;) THESE SONGS TOUCH A SPOT IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF THE SOUL, MOVING YOU IN SUCH A WAY AS TO RENDER THEM UNEXPLAINABLE. THE PEOPLE THAT BASHED THIS ALBUM ON LATER REVIEWS SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW GOOD, POWERFUL MUSIC WHEN THEY HEAR IT. IT MAY TAKE A GOOD COUPLE LISTENS TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THIS ALBUM, BUT ONCE YOU DO YOU'LL FIND IT WAS WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE PRICE: AND THEN SOME.
0385504209|4.0|I think this is a book worth reading, not necessarily because it will win Pulitzer prizes (no such luck) but because it is creative, easy to read and intriguing in a way that a lot of books are not these days.  I read this book while away on a business trip and it filled my nights after hectic days of work.  I recommend this book for someone who just wants a fun thriller that is a page turner and not so difficult to follow that you need to be on your toes while reading.  The premise is intriguing enough to make you want to delve in and the twists and turns are suspenseful enough to make you want more.  Maybe the character development leaves a little to be desired but what is there is fun and entertaining.  Makes me want to buy another Dan Brown book when I am on a trip and looking for good company when I am away from my husband!  As a lawyer, difficult, complex reading is what I do at work.  I like the energetic novels for nighttime!
B0000C23DO|5.0|This is the very first compilation that covers the band's entire career, including works from both Warner Brothers (1967-72), Grateful Dead Records (1973-75) and Arista (1977-89). This 17 track CD is to be considered a \\"greatest hit\\" rather than a &quot;best of&quot; collection, which would have contained more live material. This album contains some of their most famous songs, like \\"Truckin'\\", \\"Touch of grey\\", \\"Sugar magnolia\\", \\"Eyes of the world\\", \\"Friend of the devil\\",  \\"Estimated prophet\\", \\"U.S. blues\\" and \\"Uncle John's band\\". Grateful Dead was never a single's band, so this CD doesn't pay a fair duty to the band, but it's perfect as a starting point. This is definitely the place to start. And if you're satisfied with one Grateful Dead CD only, this should probably be the one.<br />But this CD shouldn't be you only Grateful Dead CD in your collection. Grateful Dead was, by all means, a LIVE BAND, and on this CD you'll find only one live version (\\"One more Saturday night\\"). So, if you should happen to like this CD, check out some of their live recordings too. There are a whole bunch of live albums available, so it's often hard to decide which one to buy and which one to avoid. Well, let me help you. You can't go wrong if you buy either of the following three albums: \\"Ladies and gentlemen...\\" consists of live recordings from five shows at the closing of Fillmore East, April 1971. \\"Stepping out...England `72\\" is a compilation of highlights from their UK gigs on their famous European tour in April and May 1972. \\"The closing of Winterland\\" covers the entire New Year's show at Winterland 1978/79. All three CDs show Grateful Dead on top of their career, and it will sure give you an experience of a lifetime!<br />Back to the CD: The period from 1971-72 is, for some reason, not represented in this \\"very best of\\" collection. The majority of the songs (7 of 17) are from 1970, including five from their best studio album \\"American beauty\\". The rest of the songs are mostly from 1973 to 1978. \\"The golden road\\" (1967) represents their early years while \\"Touch of grey\\" and \\"Hell in a bucket\\" are songs from their commercial break through, as late as 1987.<br />One single CD with the very best of Grateful Dead will always cause problems. Since everyone has their own favourites, you can't put all the best songs on one CD. It's just impossible. But some songs are definitely missing. OK, I can understand why a 23 minutes \\"Dark star\\" wasn't included, but what about songs like \\"Scarlet begonias\\" and \\"Playing in the band\\"? They are way more essential than \\"Fire on the mountain\\" or \\"Hell in a bucket\\"! Songs like \\"China-cat sunflower\\", \\"The other one\\" and \\"Me and my uncle\\" could easily have made it to this compilation too. Personally, I would have liked to see \\"Going down the road feelin' bad\\" on this CD.<br />But don't misunderstand me, this is a great record, and it should be found in every music lover's CD collection. It's a highly recommended CD!
B0000013GT|5.0|this album is the best of 1996 with the hits elevator and jazy belle on this disc it is worth a defianent look arguibly the bes outkat disc<br />10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats
B00014TJ7K|5.0|After &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, this is THE cd.  George was never better in his solo years, then when he teamed up with Jeff Lynne on this incredible cd. &quot;Got My Mind Set On You' was the hit single ... a cover at that ... but 'Devil's Radio', 'Fish On the Sand' the title track and the gorgeous 'Just For Today' are really standouts. &quot;When We Was Fab' was the other hit, evoking Beatle sounds and memories, is also terrific.<br />An Absolute MUST for any Beatle or George fan!!!!!!!!!

B000002WUD|5.0|By the 1970's, the psychedelia of the decade before had written Elvis out of pop culture, and he was now operating outside of rock 'n' roll instead of helping to shape it.  Nonetheless, the King re-dedicated himself to his craft.  Elvis was working hard, but no longer felt the need to prove his worth to a world that now looked past him; he just made music to please himself. There were the vices & forces that were both lifting him up and dragging him down (the Colonel, drugs, Priscilla, food, Vegas, money, the Memphis Mafia), and it was reflected in his music: sometimes his singing was inspired, and other times he sounded exhausted.  RCA has managed to assemble his best accomplishments from that era for this box set.  Throughout the dozens of songs here, he sounds relaxed yet in command.  The uptempo songs are outweighed by the ballads, but Elvis seems comfortable and sounds natural at all times.<br />Discs 1 & 2 contain all his singles and B-sides; this is where his most recognizable material appears (\\"Always On My Mind\\", \\"Burning Love\\").  Discs 3 & 4 collect \\"studio highlights\\" that display the King both in sharp focus at and mischevious play.  Disc 5 is a concert disc where Elvis makes his already-familiar material sound fresh for the audience, even if he occasionally sounds a bit tired.  His version of \\"Never Been To Spain\\" is a great concert highlight (I've enjoyed disc 5 more than other reviewers). What is most amazing is how easily Elvis navigates himself through so many styles.  Song after song we hear him simmering down into varied grooves.  Old-school blues with \\"Steamroller Blues\\", glossy rockabilly on \\"Promised Land\\", easy folk with \\"I'm Leavin'\\", slow-burning drama on \\"Make the World Go Away\\", and even some funk(!) with \\"If You Could Talk In Your Sleep.\\"  Who else can take a common country standard like \\"Good Time Charlie's Got The Blues\\" and turn it into his own soulful meditation on aging?  \\"Moody Blue\\" could only be described as country-disco, and yetthe song works!  Even when adapting known classics (Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" the Righteous Brothers' \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" and two Beatles tunes), he gives the song the energy and respect it deserves.    <BR> <BR>Lastly, people seldom give Elvis credit for his ability and desire to serve as his own producer.  Elvis tailored & arranged every song he recorded to his own liking (whereas Sinatra deferred to his conductors).  An ironic element is that every song here has Elvis incorporating a heavy arrangement of drums, bass, piano/organ, rhythm & lead guitars, back-up vocals, strings and horns - and yet it never sounds crowded, garish or overdone (others may disagree, decide for yourself).  Ultimately, this is a box set for die-hard fans who've purchased the 50's and 60's retrospectives and are craving for more.  \\"Walk A Mile In My Shoes\\" is a strong argument that the King was - for better or worse - still kicking & screaming with music, even towards the very end.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've been a fan of the White Stripes since their &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; album, but &quot;Elephant&quot; reaches a higher echelon of musical artistry. It's a throwback to the classic garage sound, but it's so rich in its simplicity that it's deceptive at just one listen. &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is a great song, but I love Meg's vocal contribution to &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot;. Some say the White Stripes are over hyped, but every album of theirs shows growth and musical advancement, that I am truly looking forwards to what they do next. Jack's not much of a singer, but the songwriting and guitar work is truly impressive, making this one of my favorite albums from the last year.
0375758992|4.0|This book takes me back to the 12 years I spent in Southern Africa. Africa is where it all started and there is something in the blood that draws me back there. <br />The descriptions are evocative and beautiful, and convey something of the problems people encountered when trying to survive in Africa. Despite all the corruption and problems I can't help loving the people there, of all races. I can't say the same about politically correct critics that have never even been there. For your information there was, for all its faults, more freedom and justice in 1970's Rhodesia than in many black African countries and a hell of a lot more than there is in Zimbabwe now. Not to mention enough food to feed everybody!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|If you loved the scores that accompianied the films of Gibson in the past, your going to love this one...though a little more atmospheric in the beginning than i would have liked..it moves on quite steadily to an awesome climax!<BR>Filled with ambient ethnic chanting and vocals , along with FULL blown choir!! and FULL orchestra with lush strings and beautiful flute solos !! THis is the purchase of the year for soundtrack collectors!!!<BR>GET IT!!!
B0001611DI|1.0|This movie is horrible. When I say horrible, I mean, I'd rather be sexually molesting Celine Dion horrible. Well, perhaps not that bad, but still. I have never turned off a movie halfway through before but this one made me do it. The acting is horrible, the plotline is basic if even existant, and the special effects are... well, lets just say it's 1978. I love B films. Cheesy horror cult films are totally sweet. However, this one is just bad. It was a waste of 2 hours. The basic \\"plot\\" is that zombies have taken over the world apparently. (of course they give no background to the story) These four people keep running around in a mall for some reason. The black dude paints the walls. I'm so pissed I saw this movie. I'm gunna go gouge my eyes out now.
6305078181|4.0|Yes, the umpteenth Dracula remake/vampire film, and I stumbled upon it one morning on a movie channel, and was taken by the title character...Frank Langella's Dracula is sexy and charming and it's easy to see how the undead keeps winning so many wives. <br />Pre-computer special effects don't really bother me: the bats are stock. The fog creeping under the door of Mina's room looks like film rewound. I DO think the mirror uses were clever, in scenes without the vampire reflections. The scene where Mina becomes herself a vampire is an ounce campy with some seventies stock film. I'm not sure if it's a volcano erruption, a lava lamp, or what, but the scene feels like the credits of James Bond movies past...aside from this there are so many romantic moments. The lava-love sequence and the vampire's seventies hair date the film a little but so what...it's a pleasure to watch and get taken in.<br />This movie is amour fou, as Lucy and the people in her life become aware of the danger that is the Count. Lucy is captivated by the vampire until the end, where she grieves for her dying lover (or-does-he-die), and she moans for him like a substance abuse addict in withdrawl. As for her father, fiancee, and friends are wounded and dying to get rid of the vampire Lucy is aware but has already accepted a new life (new lifetime, i suppose, as an undead life) and she doesn't care anymore. Lucy greives as the sun shines down, but her rescuers do not notice what she does, the figure of Dracula as a speck flying off into the horizon. The credits end in the sunny sea air-a new beginning for Mina and Jonathan, although we imagine it woun't be  long until the vampire comes back to retrieve his new bride.<br />I think Frank Langella made his the quintessential Dracula, tall dark handsome stranger. His character is never frail, but tender as the lover. He's handsome still as he sneers and spews bile at Van Helsing and his crucifix. It reminds me of Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski: who knows why you find him, a gorilla of a man, sexy? The scenes of an angry monster shine but the love scenes radiate.<br />This film was made about the time I was born; the films from my vampire phase featured Gary Oldman and Brad Pitt/Tom Cruise (no wonder I fell into a vampire phase) but this vampire has me. I stumbled onto it and too bad the films's not in print and too bad I wasn't around for the seventies stage version. Maybe Frank Langella would think about reprising the role of Dracula with another stage company...
0385504209|5.0|This is the best book that I've read in 20 years or more. Dan Brown is amazing, intelligent, and a superb writer. I read several books a week and none come close to this man's overall skills. I stayed up all night to finish it. Rarely do I find something that captures my attention so completly. The book is a historical novel intertwined with a murder mystery - a combination that works well. If you can read just one book this year, this is it. I'm looking forward to reading his other books and have just ordered them. Dan Brown, you are my hero!
0385504209|5.0|I've only read a couple of chapters in this book but I can't seems to put it down. You've got to buy this book. Dan Brown is the new #1 author on my list.
B000002UAU|5.0|First, James Leslie from NY, you are a terrible person.  Despite your incoherency in grammar mistakes and the use of 21 exclamation points, you managed to get the message that the Beatles suck across. If you really think that that the Beatles are untalented, I think that you should record a better album that Sgt. Pepper.  I will be waiting to review it, and if it is better than Sgt. Pepper, kudos to you- you will have beaten the most critically acclaimed and best-selling album and band of all time. Back to the subject, I am normally a hardcore rock fan- Nirvana and the like are spinning constantly in my CD player, but I am happy to admit that the Beatles paved the way for any modern music, and this album pushed barriers and convinced people to open up their minds to music that didn't necessarily conform to the norm (Without You, Within You- before this, most people didn't listen to traditional tabla/sitar music).  Music would be nothing like it is today without the Beatles, and every genre, from New Age to Rap, has been affected by them.  Amen.
B000077VPU|2.0|My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but great Laserdisc was wasted. It's absolutely depressing what they did here, by cutting some of the best parts of the original show.<br />The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best part of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.<BR>Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless &quot;extra materials&quot; has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).<br />I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles &quot;extra materials&quot; with a bunch of new footage.
B00005M91K|5.0|Seriously, this film is wonderful.  <br />No words are spoken the entire length.<br />The entire message is understood. <br />A BRILLIANT FILM.<br />mike
B0000CD5FN|5.0|i never felt obligated to write a review of anything i got from amazon. well let me tell you, being a die hard clash fan and purchasing most of the post-clash music (B.A.D., strummer/mescaleros, Havana 3am). i have to say this is one amazing disc. it is by far the best music that any member has done since their bitter breakup. i firmly belive that this is what the clash would/could have been if they stayed together. if you want song descriptions, read some of the other reviews, but its a shame we will not hear a followup cd that would be built off of this<br />&quot;coma girl&quot;, &quot;get down moses&quot;, &quot;arms aloft&quot;, and &quot;all in a day&quot; are all great rocking songs, &quot;long shadow&quot;, &quot;redemption song&quot;, &amp; &quot;silver and gold&quot; touch his soft side, esp. &quot;silver and gold&quot;. its funny he sang this song not knowing his near future death. its enough for you to reflect on your life and his. <br />every music fan should have this disc
B0001AP12G|5.0|After hearing this cd I am amazed that there is something actually really good coming out of mainstream music.  Ever other mainstream artist comes out with trash except for cats like Missy Elliot cuz she gots the production to rule the mainstream ear.  Kanyes beats are something else and his lyrics are in my opinion really good coming from a heavyweight producer...usually what comes out of a producers mouth sucks but I think Kanyes gonna be the new prodigy.  I would say hes the Dr Dre of mainstream music because Dre is a legendary producer in the real hip hop level and his mic skills arent bad at all.  Get this cd if your into mainstream, his beats are by far my favorite in mainstream.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Honestly, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this album. When I heard &quot;Through The Wire,&quot; Kanye seemed like an artist that wasn't about bullsh*t like ice and cars, and therefore I picked up his album. While a lot of the songs don't have to do with ice and cars, there are a few too many tracks that do deal with that stuff. I was hoping this wouldn't be the case when I bought the album but songs like &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot; and &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; are too mainstream for my liking. Another complaint I have with this album is that there are far too many skits. The message Kanye is trying to get across in some of ths skits is there, but do it by rapping, not by having some guy talk about it. Don't get me wrong though, the album is not all mainstream. There are a bunch of very good songs, and the guest appearances by people like Talib Kweli, Common, and Jay-Z among others help. I would probably give this album 3.5 stars, but it isn't deserving of 4 stars. If some of the tracks and the skits were taken off this album, it could have been better. A lot of tracks doesn't necessarily mean a lot of quality, it usually means that there is a good chance of some bad tracks being included. So if you are getting this album because &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; is #1 on 106 &amp; Park you are getting it for the wrong reason. Kanye could've done better, but overall the album isn't that bad.<br />My 3 Favorite Tracks:<br />Family Business<BR>Two Words<BR>Never Let Me Down
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh continues to astonish me.  His voice is powerful and gorgeous, his diction (in any language) impeccable.  I haven't been able to stop humming You Raise Me Up since I first heard it.  And I loved his original compositions, particularly Remember When It Rained.  On the radio station I listen to, the DJ remarked the other day that she doesn't doubt for a minute that he'll win an Oscar someday.  Hopefully it'll be soon -- and maybe with a Tony, too!<br />I'm only knocking a point off because I'd like to see him stretch stylistically a little more.  I suspect he's capable of a much wider range than we've seen so far.  Josh, keep up the great work, and I'm already salivating for your third CD!
B000025RX4|5.0|JOHNNY WINTER AND and STILL ALIVE AND WELL are Johnny Winter's best<BR>studio albums ever. On these albums, Winter moves into hard rock without abandoning his blues roots. With these albums and JOHNNY WINTER AND LIVE, Winter, who is visually impaired, proves that a handicap is only a handicap if a person lets it be one, as these albums, along with Foghat, Blackfoot, and Molly Hatchet, helped pave the way for the rawer side of 80s metal.
B0000524CY|5.0|this is a great movie, but it takes it further when you flip to FRENCH AUDIO.<br />My God, it's hysterical.  She cusses like a sailor en francais.<br />You'll scream again and again.  <br />Mike
B0000025RI|5.0|This album is a definite THRILLER. Before this album was released,the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER movie soundtrack was the biggest-selling pop/rock album in history. This album,Michael Jackson's second solo set on the Epic label,spawned seven Top 20 hits! This album was on the charts almost as long as Fleetwood Mac's RUMOURS album. In late 1982,the single BEAT IT came with the release of this album. The music from the song would be later recycled for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic's parody entitled EAT IT. The next single was BILLIE JEAN. The video was directed by Steve Barron,who would later direct the Paramount film CONEHEADS. WANNA BE STARTIN' SOMETHIN' is a discotheque favorite. HUMAN NATURE sounds cool. Also there's THE GIRL IS MINE which is a duet between Jackson and ex-Beatle Paul McCartney. McCartney later reciprocated with his song SAY SAY SAY from his PIPES OF PEACE album. P.Y.T.(PRETTY YOUNG THING) is also a discotheque favorite. then there's the title track,an ode to Halloween just like Ray Parker Jr.'s GHOSTBUSTERS. The video for the title track is not just a video. It's a mini-movie directed by John Landis,who directed the films &quot;Animal House&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. Ola Ray plays Jackson's girlfriend. They're in a movie theatre,watching a horror film. Ray found it terrifying so she walked out with Jackson following her. This album was produced by Quincy Jones who also produced Jackson's predecessor OFF THE WALL. After this album,Jackson would reunite with his five brothers as the Jacksons,and record their VICTORY album. Guest artists on this album include Eddie Van Halen of Van Halen and Steve Porcaro of Toto. Also take notice within the lyrics a pencil sketch of Jackson and McCartney pulling a woman's arms indicating the title of their duet. Jackson's next solo album BAD,released nearly 5 years after this one would be a megahit also. Hey,Jackson's not called the King Of Pop for nothing.
B00003CX95|4.0|This is a big epic movie that tells the story of the uncompromisable William Wallace.<BR>The imagery is breath taking and the acting is inspiring.<BR>Just wish that more elements of Wallaces life was included in the movie.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is my personal all-time favorite album and one even non-Who fans should own.  In this reviewer's personal opinion, it is the greatest album in rock history, period (with all due respect to Sgt. Pepper, Are You Experienced?, The Doors, Dark Side of the Moon, Zep IV, etc.) A true work of art by one of the greatest bands in rock history in their prime. Current top 40 songs pale in comparison to the tunes on this masterpiece. They just don't make 'em like this anymore, unfortunately.
B000069AUI|5.0|There's nothing wrong with loud, ear-rattling, aggressive rock anthems. There's never been a problem with that, and there never will be. But sometimes... there's a need for softness. There's a need to be melancholy, and there's a need to be blunt and simply well-spoken. What A Rush of Blood to the Head does is accomplish all this, while throwing in one rocker (ironically titled &quot;A Whisper&quot;).<br />It's great to see an album like this rack up the platinums. In fact, the mainstream love for this album is both remarkable and pleasantly fitting. The meaning of &quot;Politik&quot; is a bit subjective, but it does seem to hint at a post 9/11 theme (combine the title with the reoccuring line &quot;open up your eyes&quot;... it just seems to go together, especially considering this album was released a bit close to the disaster)... and that's what sort of music one can expect with this album. &quot;The Scientist&quot; seems to question looking at life too literally and &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;... well, it's a matter of looking at the lyrics and the titles of every song on the album, and a conclusion can be drawn. But it isn't so much those conclusions that the album's about... it's how they affect one's own life, and the lives of others. Simply put, this is a cognitive and social album, a triumph of the human soul and heart, and a look at the past, present, and how they lead to the future.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I liked this film.  I love vampires and warewolves.  Personally, I don't overanalyze horror films, so I don't get bent out of shape when one type resembles another.<br />It won't bring about self-actualization.  It's just dark fun.<br />Mike
B00000269M|5.0|BAD,Michael Jackson's third solo album on the Epic label,spawned seven Top 20 hits as did its predecessor THRILLER. The hits include the title track,which \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic would later use the music for his parody FAT. THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL kicks butt. ANOTHER PART OF ME is cool also. MAN IN THE MIRROR tells about children,naked,hungry and penniless. I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU is a duet between Jackson and Siedah Garrett. DIRTY DIANA is about an aspiring actress and/or singer. SMOOTH CRIMINAL sounds awesome. Except DIRTY DIANA,SMOOTH CRIMINAL and ANOTHER PART OF ME,the aforementioned songs would later appear on HISTORY BOOK I,PAST,PRESENT and FUTURE. JUST GOOD FRIENDS is a duet between Jackson and Stevie Wonder. In 1987,when this album was released,Wonder released an album the same year with another Jackson-Wonder duet. LEAVE ME ALONE is a bonus track,unavailable on the defunct LP. When Yankovic released his EVEN WORSE album in 1988,he did a parody of this album cover with the very same art conception.
0140177396|3.0|Steinbeck himself thought this book was most likely his worst workings.<BR>The story line is quite intresting and humorous from time to time.<BR>Though its plagued with wordiness and underdeveloped characters.<BR>The over all message of the book is excellent and is portrayed as such.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is by FAR the best new male artist on the music scence. I was interested when I first heard &quot;Follow Through&quot;, but I was cautious because it sounded like another catchy pop tune...<BR>But listening to the album in its entirety (esp to songs like &quot;I don't wanna be&quot;) dispelled any doubts about him.<BR>And to top it all off, he is AMAZING live...<BR>A must own CD.
B0000DCGT1|4.0|i love horses and the excitement of a great horse race, and this movie was pretty good at making me move to the edge of my seat. some of the romance scenes were goofy, and jeff bridges character annoyed me at times, but all in all this is a great movie.
B00005YU1O|1.0|This film isn't impressive.  I spent four years in college, got my fill of classic and contemporary philosophy, and now I watch it in an animated format.  <br />The animation didn't make it more interesting.  <br />To make a film like this....go to a university, film a philosophy professor ranting on about whatever he knows and offers, send it thru some art program on your apple, and voila...you have WAKING LIFE.<br />Snore.<br />mike
B0000VAFO0|1.0|My sister rented this a few weeks ago telling me I would really like it, (she had seen it before.) She was definatly wrong. When everyone is not killing each other there is a plot that makes hardly any sense. My dad, who usually likes movies like this wasn't able to sit through it.  For the most part it's just a lot of violence with no meaning. I'd never watch it again, and I definatly suggest not to buy it because there are so many other, better, movies out there. Anything is better then this. I really like Kate Beckansile, but I don't know why she would waste her acting abilities in this movie.
1559409010|4.0|Life of Brian as performed by the Monty Python troup is just as nonsensical as all Python movies. But this one is a little too confusing... to where you aren't sure if they are trying to be funny or just rash. There are some very cleaver moments that make this movie one of the funniest compared to modern comedies released in the thearters today. But overall it was a string of sexual inuendo's with a muttled story line.
B000001EUN|5.0|This is not my favorite album as a whole, but it does have my favorite songs that the Scorpions have ever made.  Lady Starlight is ten times better then Still Loving You (there hit off of Love at First Sting).  The Zoo has been one of my favorite rock songs for more then 20 years.  Falling in Love is another incredible song that I have to crank up everytime I hear it.  Make it real is another example of the depth of the Scorpions talent.  A collection of Scorpions music is not complete without this album.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is the greatest album in Hip-Hop History. By many this is considered as the greatest album in Rap history. If you love Hip-Hop, this is Hip-Hop at its best. I have never heard an album as lyrically great as Illmatic. Not even Ready To Die is as good as Illmatic. Nas defenitly falls under the greatest MC's of all time. Nas is not only a rapper, but simply a poet. And this album show's how great he is. Songs like 'N.Y. State Of Mind' and 'World Is Yours' really make you realize how lyrically great Nas is. This is a must have collection for any Hip-Hop fan.
B00008EY9G|4.0|I bought it and found it to be an interesting twist-type film.  It's violent and strange.  If you like a lot of rain, darkness and unanswerable violence, you will love this.<br />mike
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very nice show.  I recommend it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a classic of comedies. Slap stick funnies that don't go out of style. This movie has made people laugh since the 70's and will do so for generations to come.<BR>Its obsurd and nonsensical humour like this that makes life a little bit lighter.<br />A masterpeice in English comedy.
B000000OUJ|4.0|This CD has everything a Wu fan loves: Stark, haunting beats; great kung-fu samples; amazing lyrical wordplay; and terrific performances by other Wu members.  GZA shines on this album and proves he was at the top of his game. The movie sample that starts out the ablum is excellent and relevant for what comes next: \\"It was a bad time for the empire...\\" <br />GZA and company are on the attack on the song \\"Liquid Swords,\\" with lyrics like \\"When the MC's came, to live out their name ... Some had to snort cocaine to act insane.\\" Then comes Duel of the Iron Mic, wielding more wild kung fu sound effects and eerie gunshot samples that serve as a perfect background while GZA, Inspectah Deck, and Master Killer kick furious and ODB even shows up in the end chorus. \\"Livin in the World Today\\" is amazing, with a great minimal beat and hook, it also features some mc'in by Method Man, who was always great back then. The whole album just really flows like no other Wu album out there.  And songs like Investigative Reports showcase GZA and other Wu bangas (Raekwon, Ghostface, U-God) at their most cutting -- creating a vivid picture of the more disturbing aspects of living in America (drug culture/violence/government conspiracy).<br />The only song out of place, for me, was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. Killah Priest lays down this track and it is filled with religious fervor and, at times, intolerance: \\"Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted wth foolish men and women with wicked minds, who build picket signs to legalize abortion.\\" It's a shame, cause this album would be five stars otherwise.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Let me start off by saying that Rock and metal pureists in reference to anything linkin park need not apply.  This album is oriented toward the populus and being that, it will sound good to over 50 percent of Rock/Metal fans.  Weather you like or not, the fact is that this is not real Rock but is a homogulous gathering of pretty sounds.  It does some things right and some thiungs wrong, like every album.  What it does do right is deliver heavy bass notes and harmonic riff that sound great all the time.  It wont give you the same feelings as korn limp and metallica, but its good car tunes.  Nuff said, turn that junk up
B00005YW4H|2.0|I was very disappointed with this artist.  I don't even think she is a jazz singer in the true sense.  This record and its selections are flat.  The artist lacks shading, nuances in her vocal presentation.  Could it be she has to live a little, learn a little before she can take her place with the great jazz female vocalists who preceded her?  Yeah! the voice is clear but needs developing.  Compare her to a young Sarah Vaughan or Carmen McRae, even Peggy Lee and you'll hear there's nothing to her first CD.  I am 70 yrs old and was born and grew up in Harlem.  I've seen and heard the greatest vocalists at the Apollo Theatre and other clubs, music halls etc.,in New York.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is the best representation of Pink Floyd live you can buy.  It isn't Pink Floyd's best live material ever.  There are no official releases of the best Pink Floyd live music.  But this DVD gives you an idea of how good they would be in following years.<br />This was originally a concert movie shown in theaters in 1972.  The original movie consisted of Pink Floyd playing in ruins of Pompeii plus other sites in Rome.  In was 60 minutes of music and featured the standard Pink Floyd &quot;hits&quot; of the time, like Careful With That Axe Eugene, and Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun.  It also included the new song from the album Meddle called Echoes.  <br />In 1974, the movie was re-issued with about 20 minutes of extra footage.  The new footage consisted of interviews and showed some studio scenes of the group recording Dark Side of the Moon.  The new scenes were added between the music tracks.  I don't know if I liked the additional scenes.  They broke up the flow of the music.  Plus, when you went to see this at a midnight show, torched out of your mind, it was hard to keep awake through the extra footage.<br />This DVD contains the original 60 minute movie and the director's cut which includes the extra footage plus a few more extras.  There is also a extra interviews with the band, and with the director.  There is a history on Pompeii and footage of the band eating.  Video and sound quality are both very good.<br />The nice thing about this DVD is that it really gives you a sense of the power of Pink Floyd in concert.  You get a feel for the atmosphere of the concert, with the music blasting out of the wonderful surround sound system they used. And all the music is excellent.  I saw Echoes being played on a big outdoor screen at Universal City's downtown and it was very impressive.<br />There are some hokey, dated parts to the way the concert was filmed and the special effects.  Even in 1974, some of the effects seemed dated and cheap, like something you would see on your local TV station's dance party.   The direct even admits that some of the scenes didn't really work.  He wished he had the original film so he could redo them, but all the original tapes have been lost.  <br />But, for the most part, the camera work and editing are excellent.  The correct member of the group is shown at the right time (except during One Of These Days).   It is certainly better than the filming and editing of many of the new DVD's like the ones from Gov't Mule or Roxie Music.  Those DVD's just jump all over the place and you never get the feel that you are at the concert.<br />Pink Floyd was a very exciting band to see in concert in the seventies.  They were always experimenting with the music.  They would try out songs before they recorded them in the studio.  Atom Heart Mother and Echoes were once combined.  Dark Side of the Moon originally started out as a piece called Eclipsed.  Sheep and Dogs were originally called Raving and Drooling and You've Got to Be Crazy and they were quite a bit different than what ended up on Animals.<br />In concert, Pink Floyd would also continually modify old material to keep it interesting.  When they went on tour to promote Dark Side of the Moon, they stretched it out to 60 minutes with wonderful solos.   They were so much more interesting in the seventies when compared to their reunion tours from 1987 and 1994.   In 1994, they played all of Dark Side of the Moon in concert, but is was pretty close to the studio version and had none of the energy or sponteniety of when they played in the seventies.<br />This is the best of Pink Floyd's live albums because it is the only one from the seventies.  The second best is the live version of the Wall called Is There Anybody Out There.  I think the live version of the wall is even better than the studio version (it works better as a live show).   Next comes Ummagumma from 1969 (which has many of the same songs as this DVD) and Roger Water's live releaseIn The Flesh.  The live releases from the 1987 and 1994 tours, Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse are merely good.  There was also a TV show<BR>done by San Francisco's KQED that is rarely shown.  But the video of that is not great and I think it was recorded in mono.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Bela Lugosi's Dracula was a spectacle I've always enjoyed.  Never before has an actor's own personality so merged with a single character.  There are three granddaddies of Dracula: Voivode Vladislaus Dracula, Bram Stoker, and Bela Lugosi.  There have been Draculas before and since Lugosi, but he is the one that has become a cultural icon. His was a commanding presence, a slight androgeny, and stiff mien of a nobleman or corpse.  He had extended fingers which were like the claws of a predator, or a puppeteer.  His intonation was slow and deliberate like a hypnotist, which he had played earlier in the German movie Sklaven Fremdes Willens (Slaves of a Foreign Will).  Lugosi was no cuddly evil like Chaney Sr., or Karloff, he figurtively went for the throat.

Surfer Rosa is beyond everything. time and time again as you listen to it, it takes you somewhere better and somewhere new. anyone that rates pixies overrated or in bad taste, they couldn't be more ignorant. they need to read and listen more. Listen to Surfer Rosa with your headphones and loud. listen to it 1000 times.<BR>have a beer while you experience the album. spread the word. with all the redundant heartless music out today (blame mtv),<BR>this album is more than essential. it is necessary. sorry for being so serious,just listen to it. it doesn't matter if you listen to garbage now, maybe your taste will change. if it doesn't, the hell with you. scumbag. hahaha just kidding, well not really.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Sofia Coppola took a big gamble making this movie, IMO  and I think she succeeded beyond her own expectations. But mine is not a universal opinion, as its easy to see from scrolling through these reviews. Its a movie that kind of defies categorization: its not really a romance, its sure not an action thriller or a mystery or sci-fi or fantasy or horror. So what is it?<BR>I think Lost in Translation is a visual essay on the modern condition: disconnection from self, others, and ones surroundings. Heres the setup: Bill Murray plays American middle-aged actor Bob Harris (a generic name, if ever there was one, prob standing in for Everyman), in Tokyo to film a commercial for Santori whiskey. Hes bored, horribly jetlagged, at sea with Japanese language and the accented attempts of the Japanese to speak English to him, lonely, and disaffected. And heres one thing: Ive never before seen a movie with Bill Murray in it that I liked to any degree whatsoever; all schlock. But hes been underrated, I see now: hes absolutely superb in Lost in Translation.<BR>Our man Bob keeps encountering another American (Scarlett Johansson, of Girl with the Pearl Earring fame), equally out of synch with the time zones, more or less abandoned by her photographer husband, and already, in her young life, feeling colossally alone. <BR>They strike up a relationship of sorts, and in spite of their obvious age difference, become soul mates forever  and theres no sex.<BR>Amazingly done. Its a beautifully understated film, sad and funny, bittersweet and gentle, subtle and forceful. I loved it. Can you tell?
0446608955|5.0|A walk to remember, is an extraordinary and touching book. It is a sweet and romatic tale of young love.This tale deals with the pain and joy that two adolescents go through.This is a very  sad and depressing story, that you won't soon forget.<BR>   This story is about a girl named Jamie and a guy named Landon.Landon was a popular kid in school, on the other hand Jamie was a very shy girl.Landon dated many girls in school, he even came to think that he was in love with one of them, and he soon found out that they are not what he wanted. He then suddenly fell for Jamie the girl he would never hoped to fall for. Jamie made him see the world as it is. There lives were great even though Jamie's father was not happy with their relationship. <BR>    One day Jamie fainted, she was taken to the hospital. While in the hospital she was told that she had leukemia. After this surprising announcement, Jamie's and Landon's life changed because Jamie could no longer do some of the things she used to do. Jamie was suffering occasionaly hair lost and dizziness. Landon always stood by her side supporting her in everything that he can. He did many things to make her happy. He once took like four days to try to build her a telescope, which was what she always hoped for. As the days passed she felt weaker and her and Landon felt more in love.<BR>   One day Landon proposed marriage to Jamie, with her father's approval. After a few days they both got married in church. They lived very happily. Landon dedicated most of his time caring for Jamie until her death a few years later. <BR>     I would recommend this tragic yet spiritual love story to anyone who could handle situations like this. This story starts calm and after Jamie discovered she had leukemia, which was the turning point in the story, the story becomes very tense.

B00000DC10|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. I've owned a LOT of cd's and listened to a LOT of music, yet somehow listening to this album makes me feel like I've never listened to music before. There a lot of 5 star reviews just thrown around on amazon, but this truly deserves it. How can so many styles work so perfectly together? Techno on a punk cd? And how can a band portray THIS much emotion from a plastic disk? It's mind boggling. Dennis has more energy than anyone I can think of, and the band packs a punch to match. Like my header says, you will not understand until you listen - and make sure it's loud. It makes me gag when I hear people go goo-goo ga-ga over Blink 182, Bad Charlotte, and the like. It's a shame these people buy whatever's shoved down they're throats, even more a shame that they don't REALIZE they like it because it's shoved down their throats. So it's your choice, listen the latest trendy band and become numb (I think that's such an appropriate name for a Linkin Park song), or listen to this album and realize what music really is!
051788710X|5.0|Robert Moss may be the most eloquent and passionate writer on the subject of dreams that we have on planet Earth. His work inspired me to explore related books, especially concerning precognitive dreaming. One I found particularly provocative, and which quotes Moss extensively, is LUCKY YOU! by Randall Fitzgerald. He has a chapter on precognitive dreams and how to induce them. His book connects all the dots, with both inspiring anecdotes and scientific evidence, showing how streaks of luck and good fortune in our life can be manifested using incubated dreams, practices to sharpen intuition, and paying attention to certain patterns of synchronicities. Fitzgerald was undoubtedly inspired by Moss to take his work a few steps deeper. Highly recommended!
0440238609|5.0|I can't begin to express what these books mean to me.  These are not merely books of fantasy and, though they can be enjoyed by the young, they are not children's literature.  In fact, most people under the age of twelve probably won't fully comprehend what we're talking about here.  What we're talking about is a kind of genius and depth, power and passion that haunts you well after the final page of the third novel.  We are not just talking about kids who set out to save other kids and have funny talking animals for friends.  We aren't just talking about a great adventure that is brilliantly imagined and evoked.  What we are dealing with here is an examination of a human's relation to its soul, and what, when all is said and done, truly makes us human.  <br />Sadly, whenever I tell people about these books, I meet with vacant smiles and slight interest (after all, we can't take a children's fantasy too seriously.)  It isn't until I explain that these books are a retelling of Paradise Lost (and they most certainly are, an exquisite rendering) that I see that spark of real interest and pleasure.  Oh, so we're talking about LITERATURE.  Coming to my point: these books need to be taken out of the science fiction and children's sections in bookstores and placed on the shelves under literature.  That's the only proper place for these works.<br />Onward with the story.  Unfortunately, here's the truth.  I can't tell you.  It's not that I want to surprise you, it's that I really can't.  There's too much to explain, to have you understand.  The best I can do is this:  Lyra is a young girl living with her daemon (a physical extension of her soul; everyone has one) in Oxford.  Lyra lives in a different universe from ours.  She enjoys a happy, carefree life until circumstances force her to leave and eventually to run for her life.  The major problem: Dust.  Not normal dust, but a capitalized 'dust', one that may be the very secret to growing up, changing, and the key to the beginning and the continuation of the universe.  Lyra is entangled in a strange prophecy relating to Dust, as is young Will, a boy from our universe who enters into hers.  The two join forces and embark on a magnificent journey across time and space, meeting armored polar bears, a hot air balloon flying Texan, priest assassins, angels, ghosts, harpies, witches and on and on.  There's too much to fit in here.<br />The books are titled 'The Golden Compass', 'The Subtle Knife', and 'The Amber Spyglass.'  Each title refers to a magical object that proves invaluable in the quest.  The compass is an 'alethiometer', a truth-telling device that can answer any question in the world.  The knife is a way to cut holes from one universe into another.  The spyglass is something that allows a person to actually see Dust, which is in the air all around us.  In the end, Lyra and Will must protect the Dust, and in turn the universe.  They will also be forced to make an unbearable sacrifice to ensure the safety of all places and peoples.<br />I haven't even scratched the surface of what we are dealing with here.  We have characters that are so real you laugh when something wonderful happens to them, and cry when tragedy strikes.  I had to put the second book down when I was halfway through to allow myself to sit on my bed and just sob.  I won't say what happened, but if you become invested in these characters, you'll recognize the moment I'm talking about.<br />This review is maddening to me, because I'll never be able to explain why this is wonderful, why this is precious and why this is absolute genius.  You need to read these books and discover for yourself what exactly I'm struggling to tell you.  Pullman has crafted something that is so heartbreakingly pure and original it actually, honestly hurts me to think about it and to remember the state of wonder I was constantly in while reading.  These books have everything.  Humor, drama, mystery, fantasy, romance, action, trust, betrayal, friendship, pitch-perfect dialogue, gorgeous imagery, and the most intense originality I have seen in any book in a long time.  As much as I love Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings', I feel Pullman is the first writer who might, in time, nudge the 'Rings' trilogy out of its niche and secure the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy's place in true literature.  Pullman creates a world you've never imagined, and he does it while fleshing out each and every one of his characters until you feel as if you know them, you feel for them and understand the decisions and sacrifices they make.  These books are really, really that good.<br />I can't begin to explain the genius at work here.  It's something you must experience for yourself.  Do yourself a favor and read these books.  Don't deny yourself this incredible pleasure.

0790729652|4.0|BATMAN is the best comic book movie ever.  It is too bad the DVD has no special features at all.  Michael Keaton gets into his super-hero role better than Christopher Reeve(Super-man) and Tobey(Spider-man).  The movie begins with Batman saving a family who was about to get robbed at gunpoint just like Bruce Wayne and his family did that fateful night that Batman lost his parents and his normal life.  Wayne commits himself to taking matters into his own hand and his sole purpose in life is to wipe the criminals and crooks of Gotham City out of the picture.  When the police gets and inside tip about Axis chemicals, Jack Napier is dropped by Batman after getting his eye washed out with a toxic acid and then turns into the diabolical Joker.  The movie has great Music, Acting, Directing, and especially Production Design.  Another good comic book film with GREAT production design is the Crow.  Batman and the Crow are great movies which are just as equally Dark, Morbid, and Enthralling.
0060922583|5.0|This book came to my attention while reading LUCKY YOU! by Randall Fitzgerald, in which a strong case is made that streaks of luck are connected to our ability to induce, willfully or spontaneously, intuitive premonitions and precognitive dream states.Talbot's HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE was given as an inspiring source material and now I can understand why. Talbot explores some fascinating ways in which the entire parapsychological realm can be explained according to holographic principles. Even though Talbot died in the early 90's, his book continues to energize and inspire other authors and consciousness pioneers, as evidenced by LUCKY YOU!
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is proably Peter Seller's most enduring work.  It is funny, tense, enlightening, wierd, and it is still relevant.  There always were and will always be demagogues (George C. Scott), heroes (the President), and people so sure of their own importance, that they will ruin the earth to make their point (Sterling Hayden).  In the decades since this film was made we have the same kinds of characters, particularly those who see the only acceptable future for themselves is to destroy our world, who believe that individual lives are unimportant.
0345448898|5.0|All I can say is I am without words.  This is the most beautiful story ever written.  Book snobs, should lay off.  I adore Harry Potter and worship LOTR.  This book is in it's own place.<br />My question is...Why are all these religious fanatics reading Fantasy in the first place?  Just to have something to argue about?  Burning Harry Potter is atrocious...My GOD, get a life!  There are far more meaningful things to rant and rave about.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Probably the worst comic-to-film adaptation in a long, long time.  The good news is that Jenifer Garner is well-cast as Electra.  Also, the costume is a well-designed version of the comic book uniform.  The bad news is pretty much everything else.<br />Ben Affleck is a badly miscast as the lead.  It plays against his strengths as a cocksure young man.  Worse, it exposes his weakness when playing introspective.  Also, he and Garner have about zero chemistry.  That is a liability when their romance is so critical to the plot.<br />Neither Colin Farrel, not Michael Clark Duncan, are exactly scary as the villans.  Jack Nicholson set the bar fairly high as the Joker, but these characters fail to acheive the more modest menace Willem Dafoe projected from behind that piece of plastic in &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.<br />The action is very poorly staged and the adapted plot does not have much in the way fo suspense.  Like a lot of folks, I read the Frank Miller originals and they were much, much better.  My sense is that the film-makers were too devoted to the source material to really adapt it.  They tried to simply transpose it from one medium to another.  In my opinion, it was a massive failure.

0571196365|5.0|Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy is a book I have been waiting for in years to help me speak the indecipherable feelings inside my heart. This novella contains a very simple plot - a man who has decided to leave his wife in the next morning because he does not love her anymore. Just because he does not love her anymore? There are times for each of us, as a lover and reader, to break up with someone for some reasons, or no reasons. But the feelings cannot be simply described. Despite this, we can all find it all inside the book. Intimacy is about the internal thinking of the departing husband. It is a page turner with brilliantly-written lines. How many of us need to &quot;defer the deferral&quot; to break up? When we are dumped, we decide to remain in solitude - &quot;if one can live with loneliness, we don't need friends anymore&quot;. Intimacy is a must-read for those who are (going to be) out of love.
B00003OO3O|5.0|Force It and No Heavy Petting are at the top of my Desert island disc list. Ask any 70's hard rock afficiando who Michael Schencker is.

B000127LW2|4.0|If it weren't for the packaging, I'd have given this set 5 stars. It's terrible, but then the series never really seemed to be supported by TPTB as it's predecessors, TNG &amp; DS9 so the tacky packaging should come as no surprise.<br />It is a lot of money for 15 episodes, but remember that the first season started in January and that a couple of the episodes were held until the fall, starting with the 37's. <br />I've not seen the special features yet, but from what I read on the box, it's well worth waiting, esp. any new footage featuring Kate Mulgrew! I look forward to seeing the next full season on DVD.
B00009027B|4.0|I got this album a long time ago after seeing an add for it in a Relaspe magazine. Later to know I didn't know so many was into this band and they are legends. This is really my first true taste of this newer goth metal..doom metal...whatever you call it. It's Gothic to me. Sad, sincere, heavy and beautiful. The first track is the standout track with a sample that plays throughout the entire song for 10 minutes and works great with progression and contains some really cool piano with dark guitars. Some parts in the middle of the cd drags at parts for no reason but outside of that is great. However, what The Angel and the Dark River has that is really great is the neat use of violins. Not as background music either. It matches up with the guitar so great. Makes it heavy and pretty yet very mystical. This album gives me the vibe of being in a strange dark twisted relationship with my girlfriend.
0446530891|5.0|I admit it.  I am surprised by the hostile nature of so many of this book's reviews.  I think it is a great thriller.<br />David Baldacci has created an intricate plot that sees the lives of two discredited Secret Service Agents converge.  The story charges ahead, making the book difficult to put down.  What more can you ask for from a novel written to entertain?
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is probably one of the best mob/gangster movies available, comparable (yes, I admit) to &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy. The depiction of the rise and fall of a gangster is just brilliant and, to some extent, you tend to like Tony Montana (Al Pacino, you the man!). A cuban &quot;political refugee&quot;, as Tony himself would say, this former con arrives in Miami and establishes a whole new way of doing business: Tony's way. You get chainsaws, clowns being shot, machine-gun shooting a-plenty, cocaine sniffing, bad guys plotting evil schemes, gangster remorse, and a lot more elements needed in a movie like this. Plus you have Al Pacino in one of his most well achieved roles, with a great direction by Brian de Palma and a brilliant adaptation from 1930's Chicago (where the original Scarface takes place) to 1980's Miami by Oliver Stone. What more could you hope for?

0385504209|1.0|Even if this were it's only shortcoming, readers should snub this book. The writing style is so poor that it is distracting, and the characters so uninspired and shallow, that I was not able to read more than a couple of chapters, before putting the book down in exasperation. The character development is dispensed with in the following manner: \\"He was tall and powerfully built, with his hair slicked back, and he wore a finely tailored Armani\\".<br />The author also seems to have forgotten that punctuation exists in English language, resulting in choppy, short sentences reminiscent of a High School English writing assignment. But I suppose this must be a device to keep the thriller thrilling...<br />I'll let the other reviewers, who were obviously more patient that me, tear the story to pieces, and will just content myself with saying that this book falls into the \\"cheap supermarket novel\\" category, no matter how lofty the subject matter may hope to be, and has no claim to literature status. For that, you are better off reading \\"The Name Of The Rose\\"  or \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", where style and substance co-exist.

B000127LW2|5.0|I really enjoy the Star Trek Voyager series and am very excited about getting it. My complaint is that the packaging has gotten really cheap. ST TNG had a great box, ST DS9 was also packaged very well. Evidently someone's cousin got the packaging deal for ST Voyager. The box is a low cost plastic that opens from the top. You then pull out the disks that are in a nice orange holder. But the first disk is not covered so you can easily get it dirty and marked up. The disk labels are not easily readable since the titles are near the center. This makes it very difficult to read the episodes on the disk.  Thank goodness the episodes are listed on the back of the box.  This is no where as nice as the previous sets. I just got the set today and haven't seen any of the extras yet. But I was disappointed in the packaging as you can see. ST Voyager is like the original series in that it tried something new. And I really am excited that it is finally out. My suggestion is that for nearly $100, for a set of dvd's, the packaging could've been better. So grab your popcorn and get ready for the ST Voyager marathon at a tv set near you.

B00005JLXE|4.0|Exquisite characters and actors abound in this super-hero flick. Farrell steals the show as villians often do in movies. As Bullseye he is one of the very best comic book movie villans of all time. Jen Garner is electrifying and Michael Duncan brings menace and even humanity to the Kingpin. Duncan's Kingpin is a villan, but a human one which makes him more intriguing than most comic book movie villans. Just what made this guy what he is? Ben Affleck nails the lead role perfectly and shows he can be darker than I ever suspected. <BR>As for the supporting cast, Joe Favreau is excellent as Foggy, and it's nice to see Joe Patliano as Ben Urich. Patliano plays the role with great integrity. David Keith is thoroughly believable as Daredevil's dad, and Derrick O'Connor does very well as a priest. <BR>I like the performances and the characterizations in this film a great deal. There are a lot of realistic touches in the performances and the writing that are more human than what I've seen in most super-hero movies. Extremely cartoony moments are plentiful, but the movie is also very human at times and that's something I really appreciate about Daredevil.
B000058983|5.0|Forever Changes, in my opinion is one of the most important albums ever recorded. It was released in early 1968 and has remained, I think, as fresh sounding, relevant and unique since.<BR>With this Deluxe edition, which I have to say is a real treat, you get intersting additions to the original track line-up of the LP. More on that in just a second.<br />On this, their third album, Love became a quintet once more.<BR>Arthur Lee at the helm, Bryan Maclean on guitar and vocals, Johnny Echols on lead guitar, Ken Forssi as ever on bass, and Michael Stuart behind the drumkit. The group decided they wanted to record something a little more pastoral, so they introduced orchestrations to their sound. They also decided to use less electric instrumentation and adopted a much more acoustic approach. The album is largely acoustic, but there is room for some electricity. And where there isn't electricity in the instruments, it's in the songs themselves.<br />The first track, a Bryan Maclean song 'Alone Again Or', became a relatively big hit over in England, something that Love deserved more I think. It's got lovely mariachi brass happening in there with the folky guitar and it's a real nice start to the album. 'A House Is Not A Motel', my personal favourite on this record comes next and is a dark opposite to its predecessor. I love the creepy, Dystopian lyrics (as found throughout most of the album) and its incessant fast pace. Nice mix of acoustic guitar in the verses and mean electric in the coda. 'Andmoreagain', is the third track and is really soft and sweet. Nice lilting, shining strings and folky guitarwork. A nice slice of melancholia. 'The Daily Planet' is another of my favourites. Interesting structure, unsual lyrics, strangely happy-sounding despite its disturbed wordplay.<BR>'Old Man', another Maclean composition is also one of the best on here, I feel. Really sentimental sounding, but not to the point of sludge. Philosophical, yet simple. Maclean really was a good songwriter. It helps to have his work on there because its much more comprehensible, adding to Lee's very much dominant stream-of-consciousness regime nicely.<BR>'The Red Telephone' is excellent, a real masterpiece. Bizarre in that you really aren't sure what it's about, but you kinda get the idea. The title of the song, I think, comes from the Cold War image of the world-leader's 'Red Telephone' on the desk, the one that would be used to order and initiate nuclear holocaust. 'Maybe The People Would Be The Times Or Between Clark And Hilldale', well, what a mouthful! After typing all of that out, I think you should just listen to it!<BR>'Live And Let Live', is classic. Really nice electric soloing over spanish acoustic swishing. Utterly ridiculous lyrics to open it up, but also some political insinuations in there.<BR>'The Good Humour Man He Sees Everything Like This,' is a daintly little tune. That's all I can say really. The lyrics are similar to that of 'Orange Skies' on the previous album, Da Capo. The coda, when I first heard it really threw me. I thought either the CD or the sound system had gone haywire, brilliant studio idea. 'Bummer In The Summer', an early example of rap is a much more straightforward number. The folkiness of the song mixes well with the embryonic ghetto poetry, oh yes!<BR>'You Set The Scene', is an amazing end to an amazing album. I like to think of it as a 'pocket symphony' all on its own.<BR>The lyrics are interesting, yet as always ambiguously strange (but thought-provoking) as are the changes in structure, rhythm and pace. But it doesn't end there...<br />The additional cuts that comprise this Deluxe edition make this album doubly worthwhile. 'Hummingbirds', is an early acoustic instrumental incarnation of 'The Good Humour Man'.<BR>There's an outtake of single 'Wonder People (I Do Wonder)' on here, as well as alternative takes of 'Alone Again Or' and 'You Set The Scene.' A song called 'Laughing Stock', which I think was the B-side to 'Your Mind...' is on here, too.<BR>But the best additional features are the single 'Your Mind And We Belong Together' and tracking session highlights of that very song. They are so funny, yet it's really painful to listen to at the same time. The number of takes is gruelling, the number of mistakes is annoyingly funny and to hear Lee complaining is irritatingly hilarious. He was, and probably, is the world's most zealous perfectionist. On the last attempt of that song included in the song, they get about four minutes or so into it, just for Echols to screw up the solo right at the end. Arthur Lee gives him a good verbal thrashing from behind the booth. It's funny how Lee keeps going on about how the musicians keep 'rushing it a little' and how Maclaean keeps speeding up, and then you hear the completed single on the next track and the song's almost twice as fast!!!!<br />Five stars, undoubtedly. A masterpiece. After this the band disintegrated and Arthur formed a new band from the ruins. Only he was the original member to carry. Andmoreagain from the classic line-up, if only.
0688163173|5.0|This is the first book by Dennise Lehane I've read and it certainly won't be the last. Since summaries have been given, I'll skip that part, but wanted to add that I found Lehane's writing to be excellent.  He was very good at conveying the angst and regret US Marshal Teddy Daniels feels, the creepy personality of Dr. Cawley, and evoking a sense of agitation in the reader as the story builds.<br />Very good story by an excellent author. I do hope it becomes the movie being discussed.
B00009TB5G|5.0|yes, yes, yes, if ever there were an epic dvd this is the one its loaded with special features like the first one. it has 50 min of movie. this is better than the first but i like to look at the whole triligy as a hole so its hard to say that. if u seen the first and liked it youll love it. great great great. no words can explain how epic this is. own it now

0385504209|5.0|Since Mel Gibson's movie is being released today, I'm sure more people than ever will be reading The Da Vinci Code.  I thought this book was a good one - thought provoking, entertaining, providing a good mystery filled with historical data.  It seems to evoke either a very positive response from readers or a very negative one.  Me?  I loved it.  It's been discussed at family dinners more than once, and each time, it's a thrilling discussion.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|yes its not as good as the first but its still a good movie. if u like the first you might like this but im noy making any garenties. keanus acting is even more stiff than that of the first and this time around even the suporting cast seems a little stiff also. the new characters do absolutly nothing. but the actyion is great and the story remains solid. it gets 3 and a half stars
0385510438|3.0|The Last Juror starts out really well keeping your interest up for the first half, but as part two begins it really starts to loose it's thrill and become a different type of story.  I would recommend this book, but would not say it's one of my favorite Grisham novels.  The one thing that I really like about his writing style is how well you can picture the characters of his book in your mind.  Also, being from Mississippi I always enjoy the mentioning of towns and counties that I know...makes it a little more &quot;real&quot; I guess.  I do wish it had a little more &quot;thrill&quot; to it, especially in the end.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|Hans Zimmer has always been one of the greatest contemporary composers of all time. Having brought life to movies like The Rock, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator and the greatest and most memorable score of all time, the Lion King. Zimmer this time brings life to the Japanese epic, the Last Samurai.<br />The thing about Zimmer and how he plays things is that he is able to bring a movie from it's high epic mode to the low sad mode in just one take in just a scene. In this score, Zimmer brings forward a Japanese background into a crisp well developed composition. He seems to be more in sync with the instruments this time and avoids the mistakes of Black Hawk Down where his eclectic mix could not do justice to the Middle Eastern background. He also does not incorporate the vocals that were used in Gladiator which took the edge off the main melody.<br />Though not the Lion King, the Last Samurai is a good, well packed soundtrack that makes East and West come together in a dance that takes you to the sky and beyond.<br />Recommended.
0385504209|4.0|While this book does read like a screenplay, I still found it intriguing, entertaining and apparently very well researched. It moves along quite rapidly and creates enough suspense to make the read worth it.  Some of the scenes were over the top, but it's still a good book.<br />One positive aspect of the book is that those who read it are actually looking into the many premises offered up by Mr. Brown. Whether reading other books on the subject, researching on-line, or just talking with others, people are actually using their heads. In my book, anything that encourages learning is a good thing!
B00000K19E|4.0|the best sci fi movie ecer next to 2001. keanu reaves acting is a little stiff like always. the suporting cast is strong so the weak performance by keanu is singled out. not that keanu was awful i thought that he was pretty good but i would have chosen somone with alittle more screen presents. ground breaking fx make this a must see for fans of the sci fi genre even if it might take mutiple veiwings to understand the plot. a high 4

B00001U0DP|5.0|After reading MRD's review I had to give my two cents on the subject! <BR>If you think that the idea of the movie was to ridicule what life was like in a concentration camp during WWII, think again, and watch the movie one more time 'cause you mustn't have paid attention the first time. <BR>I see the characters portraied in this movies as heroes. The perception I got out of it was one of the highest respect (on the part of Benigni) for all those who went to great lenghts trying to survive the horrors they were put through on a daily basis, sometimes offering themselves for the ultimate sacrifice to protect each other and/or their loved ones.<BR>The bitter smiles during the &quot;funny&quot; parts of the movie did nothing but reinforce the feeling of outrage and sadness we all feel (or should feel) when thinking of that.<BR>It's a marvelous movie!<BR>A celebration of life!<BR>Bravo Roberto!!!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Beautifully shot. Beautifully rendered. Beautifully told. <br />Great music. <br />You will sit through the silences, the pauses and wonder why this film has already taken its grip on you. <br />You will mimic key phrases from the film and wonder why a film so poignant and tender can make your tummy ache with laughter. <br />You will shake your head, laugh and cry all at the same time just because everything in this movie is so heartbreakingly true.<br />Feel the love.

0679722610|4.0|&#34;Red Harvest&#34; was author Dashiell Hammett's first novel. The material was not entirely original; it first appeared in serial form in &#34;Black Mask&#34; magazine in 1927-1928 under the title &#34;The Cleansing of Poisonville&#34;. Hammett reworked the story into novel form, and &#34;Red Harvest&#34; was published in 1929. This is also the first of Hammett's popular &#34;Continental Op&#34; novels, which feature an unnamed private detective employed by the Continental Detective Agency of San Francisco. &#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s narrator and veteran Continental operative defies any idea of a glamorous or attractive crime fighter. He's short, pot-bellied, alcoholic, and resolutely cynical. He's living in an immoral world, where success comes to those who fight fire with fire. Like all of Hammett's protagonists, he has little use for the law, but lives by a personal code to which he strictly adheres. That doesn't make him especially ethical, only principled. But Hammett's characters, like Hammett himself, are coping in their own way with the widespread corruption that ruled America's cities in the 1920s and 1930s.<br /><br />&#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s opening paragraph is one of the best hooks I've ever read in a novel. It's fantastic. We are sucked into the mind of our narrator, the unnamed Continental operative, and we want only to read more about this man of such blunt wit. The Continental Op has been called to a town named Personville by the owner of the town's newspaper, Donald Willsson. He doesn't know what the job is, but before he can find out, the client is murdered. So the first order of business is to solve the murder. In doing so, our detective discovers how Personville got its nickname, Poisonville. Everything and everyone in this town is corrupt. Its citizens are ruled by bootleggers and low-lifes who retain their power through  indiscriminate violence. Even the town's former boss, Elihu Willsson, a wealthy industrialist who was not above murder in his own day, is now reluctantly under the thumb of the new crop of thugs. Our detective takes offense at Poisonville's powers trying several times to assassinate him in the course of his murder investigation, so he decides to stay and clean up the place. Little did he expect that Poisonville's rampant bloodshed would poison him, as he is seduced by the town's murderous ways.<br /><br />It's surprising to me that Dashiell Hammett wrote &#34;Red Harvest&#34; years before &#34;The Thin Man&#34;. &#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s style seems more developed and its characters better drawn than in the later novel. That's not to say that I don't like &#34;The Thin Man&#34;. I actually prefer its more scandalous brand of cynicism. Hammett is always cynical, but sociopathic behavior is to be expected from the characters that inhabit Personville's landscape. They are criminals and police officers (remember, this is the 1920s). The undeniably sociopathic behavior of everyone in &#34;The Thin Man&#34; -from small time con men, to respectable bourgeois, to Park Avenue blue bloods- is like a slap in the face. And so is the book's shameless lack of justice. But perhaps Hammett  just chose a different  shock tactic in &#34;Red Harvest&#34;. The book's greatest cynicism is in the ease with which the Continental Op is seduced into abandoning his own code of conduct when faced with the opportunity to murder without consequences. That's why they call it Poisonville. Fans of noir detective stories wont' want to miss &#34;Red Harvest&#34;. There are enough hard-boiled one-liners to inspire glee in those who really enjoy them. Hammett's style is fluid and easy to read. And there is more than one mystery to be solved.is now reluctantly under the thumb of the new crop of thugs.

0440236738|5.0|I have been avidly following the writing career of Harlan Coben since the early days of the Myron Bolitar paperback originals in the early to mid 90s. It is interesting to note the progression of this writer's developing talent. The early books were relatively lighthearted and, at times, downright hysterical romps around the northern New Jersey and Manhatten area. They were quite evidently reflections of the author's milieu where he grew up. They are filled with much Jewish angst and, overall, they create a very human portrait of Myron Bolitar. As the books progress, they become much darker with deeper meaning . In fact, from lighthearted humor tragedy rears its ugly head. Now, Harlan has left Myron to write stand-alone thrillers that pierce the human psyche. He also is being well compensated for these new books which I hereby entitle \\"The return of the dead?\\" in that both TELL NO ONE, as well as, our current consideration, GONE FOR GOOD, have as their central focus a character believed to be dead yet true doubts exist.<BR>     Will Klein is told by his mother, on her deathbed, that his brother, Ken, is still alive. Ken disappeared years before after he was accused of raping and murdering a neighbor's daughter. It was assumed that Ken had to be dead in that he would never have had the resources to remain alive. Will currently works for Covenant House in Manhatten with his close friend, Squares, a reformed white supremist. They help abused and runaway children. Unfortunately for Will, soon after his mother's death, his girlfriend, Sheila, the love of his life mysteriously leaves him. He pursues her and looks into his brother's disappearance. He begins to find answers to difficult questions. The answers might very well prove there is much he needs to know about Sheila and Ken.  With the new knowledge comes danger.<BR>     As a long-time reader of Harlan Coben, it is gratifying to see some brief episodes of humor in the Bolitar vein. Squares very much reminds this reader of a much more human Win, Bolitar's partner and sidekick. Yet there are long passages that exude the true power and beauty of Harlan's writing. The type of writing that forces the eyes backward to fully experience those words again. I almost never quote but this is just one striking example:<BR>     \\"Morty played in Las Vegas, Las Vegas-the real Las Vegas, the city itself, no strip-strolling tourist trade in psuedo-suede and sneakers, no whistling and hollering or squeals of joy, no faux Statue of Liberty or Eiffel Tower, no Cirque de Soleil, no roller coasters, no 3-D movie rides or gladiator costumes or dancing water fountains or bogus volcanoes or kid appeal arcades. This was downtown Las Vegas. This was where grimy men with barely a mouth of teeth per table, the dust of their pickups still coming off them with each shoulder slump, lost their meager paychecks. The players here were bleary-eyed, exhausted, their faces lined, their hard times baked on by the sun.\\"<BR>Without the constraint of a series, Harlan can feel free enough to take his stories' characters wherever he wants them to go. They explore the very dark faces of society and do so in the confines of a truly gripping thriller where things are never as they seem until the very last page. Harlan Coben today-bestselling author, Edgar winner, writer of rare talent and one of the best storytellers on the planet.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Deliberately more understated than many Hollywood movies with such high ambitions, \\"Big Fish\\" offers a lot to cheer about, yet it still misses something. The film relates a story of Edward Bloom, an aged (and now dying) man, whose life, although rather ordinary, is enhanced by his wild imagination to a kaleidoscope of extraordinary, magic-tinged stories. Almost everyone is touched by those -- except for Ed's son Will (Billy Crudup), who nevertheless does not give up and sets out to learn something more about his dad before it may be too late.<br />The trademark Tim Burton's direction (after \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" and \\"Ed Wood\\" we now have Ed Bloom) once again weaves the real with the magic, but especially the magic does not work fully (despite great work by the star-studded cast). True, one might be inclined to say that Burton was avoiding the saccharine sweetness of many Hollywood melodramas on purpose.<br />Anyway, Ewan McGregor (young Ed) and especially Albert Finney (old Ed) feel like at home in their roles, Crudup (\\"Almost Famous\\") offers a low-key acting of a decent caliber, yet the show-stealing are two actresses: Jessica Lange as Ed's wife in later years and Helena Bonham Carter as a grown-up Jenny, years later following her first encounter with young Ed.<br />\\"Big Fish\\" is a fully-fledged tribute to storytelling. It had a potential to be an ultimate one, but, unfortunately some \\"magic\\" scenes did not cut it well enough and remained on the level of average imagination. The real was real enough (sometimes even more magical than the 'magic', i.e. a bathtub scene with Finney and Lange) and the film deserves over-all kudos, at least for being a family fun, which is rare these days; also for music and production design. But the potential went just a bit unfulfilled this time.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Thanks to the thoughtfulness and tenacity of a friend, I have a copy that was put on a shelf and sold before the recall. <br />I have checked  out everything but the commentary and there are no flaws, not even the menu problem mentioned by another reviewer. <br />Absent any statement from Buena Vista, we may as well conclude that they postoponed the release (again) until after the Academy Awards, hoping that Depp or Murray will win. Then they can change the packaging to reflect the Oscar victory and release it with fanfare. <br />Yet another predictably stupid marketing ploy. These middle management stiffs have to impose a lame idea on everything; They are only alienating the viewers who really want this disc; as for the potential sales boost from a Depp or Murray Oscar victory, do they think that those buyers would be less likely to purchase it because it's already been out for a month?  <br />The disc is first rate, with the kind of substantial deleted scenes that pursue plot threads further and are therefore of interest to any fan.  The featurettes are all solid. Thanks to the reviewer who pointed out the \\"easter egg\\" additional deleted scene.<br />Hope they release it promptly.
B0000029AP|5.0|When Aerosmith started to really crack down on their goal to become &quot;America's Greatest Rock Band&quot; (a journey started in 1971), they were quickly dismissed as &quot;The American Stones.&quot;  High praise for some, it was meant to be derogatory, and Aerosmith meant to live past it.  Well, guess what?  No one calls them the American Stones anymore... and &quot;Toys in the Attic,&quot; their first rock and roll hall of fame type record is the reason.  Though initally well-recieved because of the classic rock standards &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; &quot;Toys&quot; has lived well beyond the big singles as a solid, well-crafted piece of americana.<br />Fusing blues, catchy tunes, and the band's regular dirty riffs and lyrics, they created their first 5 star album; one for the ages.  The tunes range from hobo-on-the-porch stories of &quot;Uncle Salty,&quot; to the bluesy &quot;No More No More,&quot; to the full metal &quot;Round and Round,&quot; there are no losers in the 9 song set.  Not a weak moment to speak of.  And &quot;You See Me Crying&quot; is such R&amp;B bliss, that when Aerosmith reformed for &quot;Done With Mirrors,&quot; the band wanted to do a cover of it; that is until Joe Perry reminded them it was themselves.<br />&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; is one of those rare albums that is equally strong track-by-track and in its entirety; it's regarded as a classic for good reason.  If you're a new Aerosmith fan (unlikely), start here.  Overall:  10 out of 10.

B00005JMQ0|5.0|Robert McNamara, one of the most influential leaders of our time, submits in this brilliantly composed documentary to one of the most excruciatingly intimate looks at ones own life I've ever been privileged to.<br />\\"Fog of War\\" chronicles R.M.'s rise to power from a modest (1920's) middle class childhood, through his years as a \\"super-student\\", his brief but extremely successful stint in the private sector, the \\"from left-field\\" recruitment by J.F.K. himself from Ford Motor Company (where he was serving as the first non-Ford family President for something like 2 weeks) to become Secretary of Defense during one of the most \\"white knuckled\\" periods in human history (Cuban Missile Crisis), then a horrible romp through Vietnam under Johnson.<br />Roughly two hours of interview with RM are punctuated by still/full motion clips, and audio related to the events he was pushed into, behind, embroiled in, or all the above.<br />Knowing what little I do about the Director (and whatever bias' he may have), and McNamara (I was born at the tail end of Vietnam), this was a compelling, pertinent (in so many ways to our present national dilemnas), and entirely interesting movie.  Even those relatively uninterested in politics or history would have a hard time suppressing fascination with the paramount decisions the man staring back at them from the screen had to make.  His accounts of the discussion that went on behind closed doors during the Cuban Missile Crisis literally sent chills down my spine as I looked up and realized that the man being interviewed may very well be as much the reason for my being alive as my parents!<br />It's unfortunate for McNamara that he remained in office after JFK died, for it was during the tumultuous and confusing years of the Johnson administration that policies such as \\"pre-emption\\" and \\"containment\\" would lead to such admittedly awful mistakes as our engagement in Vietnam was.  But the lessons he learned, the mistakes he admits making as a relatively conscientious decision maker, are so incredibly valuable.  In particular, I found his revelation about empathizing with \\"the enemy\\" to be among the most valuable of his lessons.  McNamara organized a meeting (some 25 years after Vietnam) with the leaders that opposed him during the war and learned that the way the Communist North viewed the war was fundamentally different than McNamara thought.  He learned that the North believed that the US (instead of \\"containing the spread of Communism) was just another Imperialist nation trying to enslave it (as France had done for so many years before), and that they basically viewed the War as a struggle for freedom and independence that would have likely justified fighting to \\"the last man\\".<br />I don't think this movie is necessarily anti-war, or anti-McNamara, I myself found allot about him admirable, including the bravery it took to do a film like this.  However, I believe that many will villify him as a \\"murderer of a million\\".  By way of example, I was standing at a urinal after the movie when some guy who had just seen it took to trying to start up a conversation about the movie by saying \\"Looks like we got another one in Rumsfeld, eh...\\".  I replied \\"I hope so\\" (which petrified and insulted him).<br />I don't necessarily \\"hope so\\", but my dramatic retort was more meant to challenge the ungrateful villification of McNamara.  I think if every leader with the kind of extraordinary weight in responsibility that McNamara had stepped up and offered honest insight like this, the world would undoubtedly be a safer place to live.<br />Hope this was helpful.elatively conscientious decision maker, are so incredibly valuable.

B0000AM6LY|5.0|A few weeks ago a co-worker and I had a debate on who was singing &quot;Feel brand new&quot;. She was convinced that it was the Stylistics. I Grew up listening to Simply Red, so I instantly recognized Mick Hucknalls' voice. I told her that it was a cover, but it had the passion of the original. I mean Hucknall must have studied the original singers voice, because the song is in some respects identical. Since the death of Robert Palmer, to me there are only four people in the category of white British soul that have truly hit the target: Paul Carrack, Van Morrison, Mick Hucknall, and Annie Lennox. Put those people together, and you will have one hell of an album!
B000084T18|2.0|It's obvious 50 has some talent, he is a decent lyricist.  The problem is that his image has superceded his talent.  <br />All these girls coming on here saying &quot;ooh ooh, 50 is so hot and he's so good at rap&quot; you have no idea what you're talking about.  <br />50 cent is a decent rapper, nothing more.  He is currently hip hop's golden boy because he has something every suburban white kid would die for : Street cred.  And I'm talking real street cred on the ghetto streets, not the wild streets of Iowa City or Bergen County.  <br />It's very simple.  The people who LOVE 50 cent are the worst type of rap fans.  Very few hard core hip hop heads who been down from day 1 think he is GREAT.  All the suburban white boys and especially the white girls love 50, that's fine.  But he's a cartoon character to them, not a lyricist.
B00018D44U|3.0|Being an enormous fan of 'Come Away With Me,' I immediately dropped the cash to pick this one up when I saw a single copy nestled sunggly on the cd rack at Best Buy (Great price for it this week, the deciding factor in the purchase $9.99). After three times through this albumn, I'm not nearly impressed with it as much as 'Come Away With Me.' This one is definitely more country than jazz, as is evidenced by Dolly Parton's self-indulgent appearance on the album (I hate vibrato, and she uses entirely too much in her singing). Since I'm more of a Jazz/Blues fan than country, this did upset me. <br />However (ever notice there is always a however or a but?). This is better than most of the albumns that have been released in the last month. And like it or not, Norah still has that seductively sultry voice that sends tingles up the spine, and makes you long for a glass of wine and a lover's touch. Still works as mood music; a good background for a romantic evening. &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;What am I to you?&quot; are my particular favorites, probably because they've proved to be the most catchy after only a few times through the album. There are love songs on this album, and since many were co-written with her boyfriend and bassist, Lee Alexander, the lyrics are a little more poignant. <br />I don't doubt that this will grow on me, and I will change the review to be a little less critical. However, the point I want to make is that if you are expected to be blown away like you were when you greedily bought 'Come Away With Me,' ran home with a silly grin on your face, dropped it in your cd player, and melted to such a soulful new sound, you might be disappointed.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I just saw \\"Lost In Translation\\" last night, trying to view all the 2003 Oscar Contenders before February 29's Academy Awards.  After seeing it, I'm wondering if the critics saw a completely different film.  It's certainly different from its rivals for Best Picture, but different isn't always better.    Critical accolades and Oscar nominations aside, \\"Lost In Translation\\" suffers from a complete lack of plot and character development.  Director Sofia Coppola certainly has an eye for interesting shots, but her talents as a screenwriter need development.  Coppola is astounded at what her camera finds in Japan, but will you be?  Wow: Japan has karaoke!  Video arcades!  Obnoxious talk show hosts!  What a crazy country!    Billed as a romantic comedy,  \\"Lost In Translation\\" takes forever to go nowhere.  70 minutes pass before lead characters Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have a serious conversation.  Up to that point, the film presents a \\"slice of life\\" view of Japan.  Murray and Johansson run from one party to another, enjoying each other's company but never really developing any rapport or chemistry.  Coppola falls in love with her shots, but lingers way too long on each one, utterly failing to develop any dramatic momentum.  The talented Giovanni Ribisi is wasted in a nothing role.    I'm certainly not biased against films with a minimum of dialogue or action (after all, my favorite film is \\"2001: a space odyssey\\").  But Coppola's talents have not developed to the point where she can find the right notes in such a subtle story.  Perhaps she had a great film in Japan, but something has indeed been \\"lost in translation.\\"

0312263120|2.0|This book is probably one of the most disappointing that I've ever read.  After The Da Vinci Code, I was expecting a lot from this book.  Even after reading the synopsis and the first couple of chapters I was still expecting a great read.  Instead, what I received was mindless and ridiculous.<br />Note, I know very little about computers and encryption, but I found the underlying story to be decently believable.  However, some of the issues about which these characters struggle are so obvious that it makes these seemingly intelligent characters seem stupid (especially during the ending).<br />Overall, an semi-entertaining read but one that was more frustrating then satisfying.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|In writing this,I have to admit to having  not seen the DVD version of this film.But I have seen the cinema version just this afternoon.What a lot of overrated tripe.The film has no meaning,no goal,and seems to drift from scene to scene.The characters seemed to lack a sense of purpose,and the European style &quot;lingering shot&quot; just looked ridiculous,as if the script writer had run out of ideas.I found trying to identify with the characters hard going ,and ultimately couldn't care less.If I were Bill Murray,I would be embarrassed to have appeared in this film,and even more embarrassed to receive an oscar for this role,a role in which not much was required.And as for Scarlett Johansson,the only thing that can be said about her ,is that she looks good in her underwear,little else.<br />Lost in Translation's right,utterly lost.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|While original &quot;let it be&quot; was sounding a bit dated and remained a bit weaker beatles album, &quot;let it be naked&quot; sounds incredibly well produced and crispy - you can always feel lennon standing behind speaker. <BR>the sound is biggest value here - songs are of course a bit different (&quot;long and winding road&quot; without orchestration sounds great too) but not all - for example some tracks are almost the same as original. suprisingly the different tracklist is not a bad idea - there is a better chronology in tracks,now they sound like they sound always sound. tracks Overproduced by Spector,now only contain some real raw guitars without all those orchesta and strings stuff.<BR>waht can i add more - many reviewers wrote too about sound improvements. i must say that anyway &quot;let it be&quot; remains in my opinion much weaker piece of music than &quot;sgt.pepper&quot; or &quot;Magical mystery tour&quot;.you could hear the pressure in band that aready was still friends but friends who didn't liked working together.<BR>3 stars for Let it be.1 star more for improvement in sound and songs = 4 stars.<BR>get it anyway - a must have in rock fans collection and for anyone who thought that &quot;let it be&quot; sounds overproduced

B0001906O0|5.0|The only thing I don`t like about this boxset is that I want to think it`s all my own, but, no, tons of other people love The Cure and their music too.<br />What can I say that hasn`t been said?<br />The first Cure I heard was the B side of the tape of &quot;Standing on a Beach.&quot;  I loved that stuff.  That was in 1989.  It`s now 15 years later and I`ve got not only those songs with CD quality, but 3 MORE CDs with similar stuff.  Awesome!!!<br />Another think I don`t like about it?  I was 19.  The future of being in a band like the Cure was all ahead of me.  It didn`t happen.  Looking now at 33 I feel that I didn`t make it.<br />Have a nice day Cure guys.  What`s your next move?  Music until death?
B00005ASOC|3.0|Although this movie didn't engage me as much as most of Connery's movies, I still enjoyed it, and he's still excellent as the crusty but reclusive writer who takes a brilliant young black kid under his wing and nurtures his writing talent. Rob Brown is also excellent in the role and surprisingly good since he is apparently a non-actor. The relationship that develops between the two unlikely friends grows out of their love of books and writing, and they come to like and respect each other despite the cultural and generational gap that exists between them. F. Murray Abraham is also great playing the villain as usual who wrongly attempts to get Rob expelled for an infraction, when Connery suddenly comes to his aid at the climax. This reminded me of the final scene in \\"Scent of a Woman\\" in which Al Pacino comes to the aid of Chris O'Donnell at his exclusive New England private school. A little piece of trivia--did anybody notice the ending music during the credits with the Jamaican steel drum band? It was the same music used during the credits in the Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek movie, Badlands, about two serial killers in South Dakota back in the 50's. I loved that music but have no idea about how to get ahold of it, and I was amazed to find it by chance in this movie. The only reason I don't give the movie more stars is that it just doesn't seem to get off the ground dramatically, but maybe I just don't appreciate the director's naturalistic, low-key style, since that could have been what he intended. Overall, however, it's still a good flick and worth seeing if you're a Connery fan like me.
1577311523|5.0|Thought provoking. I put this by my favorite books, so that I can reference it and re-read. The power of now is a re-read book, so is anything by Wayne Dyer and Tiffany Snow. There are just some words a person needs in their lifetime, and these are it. I don't loan these out to anyone else! They're too precious.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Wow this cd is awesome.  It's fine classical guitar segments are nice and humble.  Then it explodes into its full rock session.  These guys are truely incredible musicians.  They play ferociously and press onforth.  The moor is one of the single-handedly most awesome tracks I have ever heard.  The rest of the cd is great, but you should buy this cd alone just for the first track.  Number three is also a standout, just in its differences between the rest of the cd.  Beautiful song.  Get this cd.
140010078X|4.0|After a former pirate dies at his family's inn, young Jim Hawkins inadvertently stumbles across a treasure map of the notorious pirate, Captain Flint. he, and two others decide to set out to find Flint's treasure, but they are not the only ones who know of the map's existence....<BR>Once onboard their newly purchased ship, the Hispaniola, Jim overhears the plans for mutiny by the crew, most of whom sailed under Captain Flint while he lived, and who are led by Long John Silver, the supposed amiable ship's cook.<BR>\\"Treasure Island\\" tells of the conflict between Jim Hawkins & co, and the mutineers, and is full of well developed characters, who, while they are not \\"perfect people\\", have good intentions, and act as you would think they would in real life. the pirates are treacherous and double-crossers, who care only to get the gold, and the protagonists are merely trying to stay alive; while this plot may be a little cliched, in some cases, cliches are what work, and I have nothing against that. unfortunately, this book isn't one of them. My only complaint was the overused plot style, which wasn't either original or suprising, as I mentioned earlier, and despite colorful and innovative language and characters, it still follows the simple good vs evil/going on a treasure hunt scheme, which doesnt appeal to me personally.<BR>All in all, if you're looking for something new and different, this probably isnt the book, but if you don't mind a return to the classic adventure stories, than start reading!
B0000029GA|5.0|A 10 track classic (if you count the intro).  I could give you a book of how great this CD is, but I'll just say this.  From the first song to the last, it's perfect.  Nothing much more to say.
0385504209|5.0|My realtor suggested this book and now I owe him!<br />It starts off with the chief curator of the Louvre being murdered for a secret.  He lies to his killer; who leaves him to die.  The the curator does something strange.  He strips, draws wierd symbols on the floor, and sets off the alarm which seals him in the museum, and then he positions himself in a strage way!<br />Enter: Robert Langdon a professor of symbology who was trying to get a decent nights sleep.  He is dragged to the scene and then becomes the main suspect for the murder!  His case is not helped by the fact he was supposed to meet the curator.  He evades capture with the help of a beautiful brilliant cryptologist with a past.<br />You enter a world of intrigue that covers history, pagonism, Christianity, the Knights Tempelor, and a secret socity that is holding a closely guarded secret that may cause the downfall of Christianity!<br />The characters are great!  Langdon is not Indiana Jones! He is a professor and lecturer who would probably shoot himself if he needed to handle a gun!<br />Now as the the claims of Relgion bashing.  There is a HUGE clue on the cover of the book!  &quot;A NOVEL by Dan Brown&quot;  A person told me she saw Dan Brown speak and he said &quot;It is a novel and that he stretched facts to fit the story!&quot;<br />It is a great read that draws you in.<br />A good indicator of telling a good story is that people belive it to be true even when you tell them it is a novel!<br />I will look at his other books and I kind of think this would make a great movie!

B0000AUHOH|2.0|Well now, this is by far the worst Star Trek movie ever.  The movie is so innacurate, such as how the Enterprise made it to the center of the galaxy, over 30,000 light years away, in under a few hours.  You watch shows like Star Trek Voyager, where the ship is stranded 70,000 light years away from Earth, and the trip will take decades.  The Enterprise-A is a much older and slower ship than Voyager, and it should take them decades to reach the center of the galaxy, not hours.<br />The innacuracies is not the only thing, I cannot think of anything more dumb than a \\"god search\\" by a Vulcan on Star Trek!  I have been a Star Trek fan for a very long time, but even as a fan, I must say that this movie does not portray the Star Trek franchise in a very good way at all.
0671722905|5.0|The Tempest is a play filled with deceit, manipulation and magic.  Prospero was dethroned from his dukedom and sent to an island, he uses magic to lure his enemies there.  This is unlike any Shakespeare I have read before, I  enjoyed but was a bit surprised.  Shakespeare doesn't usually lean toward magic but this time he did.  It was enjoyable, a fast read, that takes a reader into another world.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Living over-seas in Southeast Asia, I was really looking forward to enjoying this movie.  It was a tremdous disapointment.  It is horribly slow, has little plot, and can these character's be more self absorbed?  Japan is such an interesting place to visit even if you don't know the language. But these characters are so shallow they can't get past the differences in the language.  If &quot;Charlotte&quot; is supose to be a philosophy grad, she sure wasted a lot of time in Japan not looking into the incredible amounts of philisophical sights and ideas that are right on the surface of this culture.  It was about two really insecure people that had nothing to offer the audience at all.  A great Graduate school project, but don't waste your money.

6305280762|3.0|This film was the pinnicle of the disaster movie genre.  I recall it's release in the UK in 1975.  I even have the original film posters, collectable booklet and press kit (long before EPK!).  It ran for 26 weeks on the huge screen known as ABC1 in Leeds.  Seats were sold out for weeks, even the expensive pullman seats.  You couldn't get a booking, you had to queue around the cinema waiting for a cancellation.  And the queues would literary snake around the cinema!  This was the roadshow 70mm, six-track stereophonic sound presentation.  The only thing that knocked it from the number 1 screen was a film called Earthquake and they needed the large hall for a new sound system called &quot;sensurround&quot;......still Towering Inferno went on to play for another 10 weeks to crowded halls in ABC2....<br />I have the edited 8mm 6 reel hightlights, the two laser disc releases (the THX version was realeased in 1995) and the non-anamorphic DVD.....<br />So when are Fox or Warner (both hold rights to this title) going to do the decent thing and restore this classic to it's former 70mm roadshow glory?  A two disc special edition would be real nice.  By all means include the deleted scenes on disc two, by all means use seamless branching on disc 1 to choose either the regular 35mm version or the 70mm roadshow version (there some different edits between the two, how many can remember that the 70mm roadshow had an intermission as a cliffhanger, just as the stairwell blew up when Jennifer Jones and Paul Newman were trying to escape with the two kids?).  Even the soundtrack was mixed differently for the 70mm roadshow as 6-track sterophonic compared to the mono mix and 4 track stereo mix of the 35mm prints (how many remember that in the 70mm version there wasn't any music during Susan Flannery's demise in the apartment and when she broke the window with a chair, falling out of the building, just the sounds of the fire, which made it more horrific?)......<br />Here's hoping.....One Tiny Spark Becomes A Night Of Blazing Suspense......
B000099T2L|1.0|I have listened to the whole album just to tell all you people reading this right now. ALL I have to say is this album only have a few good songs which are Baby Boy, Me, Myself, and I and thats basicly it...not Crazy in Love even though alot of people liked it....but I just thought it was not good enough...don't hate me just because I gave this CD a 1 star...it just didn't blow me away...buy it if u want to cause I don't care....
B00001QGPS|5.0|Methodman &amp; Redman are plain incredible in their solo projects, but when brought together they surpass even the above average quality of their separate work. They fit toghether really great and spit original and energetic rhymes. There isn't but one track on this album that I could label &quot;trash&quot;; all of them are very enjoyable and entertaining, the rapping skills of both artists are incredible. There are no needless skits (in fact there is only one plus the intro, but that is merely all). This is, I would easily say, an essential rap album and it truly deserves its 5 stars.
B000127LW2|4.0|I have to say that Voyager was a favorite TV show of mine.  I have enjoyed the entire ST franchise from TOS to Enterprise.  I just got my DVD's in the mail and I have to say, the packaging is total crap.  Foreign customers will certainly get better (just look at TNG's box sets).  Very disappointed, and may just buy the rest of the series from Amazon UK ( but with the dollar the way it is - YIKES ).<br />I'm looking forward to watching the first season again and going through the extras.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|It's painfull when you want to listen to new music and you come across a band like Jet.  These guys have stolen their look, sound, and lyrics from just about every modern band copying 1970's rock.  Not only are they stealing ideas from a current peer (Strokes, Hives, White Stripes, etc.), but they are stealing ideas from people who had stolen THEIR ideas (Strokes, Hives, etc.).  Kinda pathetic.  I know it's hard to come up with an original musical idea, but at least TRY!!  They just listened to the Strokes, the Hives, and the White Stripes and copied them exactly.  Their single, whatever it's name is, is just 1 chord during the verse.  Hey, I love powerchord rock too.  I love (real) punk.  But it's ONE CHORD!!!!  That stupid repeated chord and those terrible lyrics!!  I can't believe how many people eat this stuff up.  PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SUPPORT ORIGINAL MUSIC!!!  There are plenty of CDs to buy out there!! Please don't tell the record companies that this is what you want or they will keep churning out pathetic copies like this!
B0000714B5|5.0|If you have read the book by Herman Hesse and  loved it, you will most probably love this film too. It is a good attempt to transfer Hesse's philosophical treatise to screen - and any attempt at transmitting such writing is bound to fall short in some ways to some people. Some of my 'favourite bits' were cut, but overall I love the film and will be watching it again.<br />HOWEVER<br />if you have not read the book, then I recommend you read it before watching the film; otherwise it may seem disjointed.<br />Also, you will then realise that Siddhartha is NOT the buddha - that he was a seeker after truth, -until he gave up seeking- and would accept no other persons version of truth - not even the Buddha's (who he meets in the film). (The experience of realisation is incommunicable).<br />Those who 'follow' or 'belong', -Buddhists  or prospective Buddhists -  would do well to &quot;follow&quot; Siddhartha's example as even the Buddha in the Pali canon states: 'accept no teacher, follow no one, rely on your self'. Hesse's Siddhartha essentially is expounding the philosophy of Advaita, or nonduality.<br />I suspect this explains some of the 'misconceived' reviews below.<br />Picture quality: although the film was made in 1972 it has been expertly restored and whoever has done the transfer to dvd did a good job because the picture quality is better than many transfers of more recent films.<br />Recommended

B000002IGV|5.0|This was the album that put Twisted Sister on the map. I had been listening to Dee Snider's radio shows and heard some of the songs on this album, so I decided to give it a shot. I figured I would like it since I'm into metal from the 80's. I couldn't stop playing it for the first few weeks I got it. There is some great music on this album. Unfortunately, as an earlier reviewer mentioned, people dismissed them becuase of their redicoulus costumes, long hair, and comedic music videos, but if you put \\"Were Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\"(which I think are great songs by the way)aside, Dee wrote some good lyrics to the title track, the \\"Horror-Teria\\" medley, \\"The Price\\", \\"Don't let me down\\", and \\"The Beast\\". The album closer \\"S.M.F.\\" of course went on to become the name of their fans, and 20 years later people are still banging their heads to this album. Plus, he kept the music simple, and sometimes the most simple things can be the most effective. This album is no exception. Dee is also keeping it real as a DJ, hosting the \\"House of Hair\\" radio show, which I listen to every saturday, in which he plays the best of the Hairband/Heavy Metal era. A big up to Dee for keeping the music of that era alive, because it's alot better than half the stuff out their today. Don't pass up this piece of that era. Buy it, and as it says in the booklet: PLAY IT LOUD, MUTHA! S.M.F.'s unite!
6304011431|5.0|What would happen if a being with an I.Q. off the measuring scale ,and near god-like powers, were born in rural Texas? Why, he would automatically be labeled as a freak, defective, retardate, and deviant, of course!<br /><br /> That's the message of this message film, namely, that all you have to do to be denigrated and dehumanized in most of American society is to be \\"different.\\" Whether that difference makes you fundamentally superior or inferior to the norm is irrelevant- all that matters is the fact that one is different. If you don't \\"smell right\\" to the dominant ape-like personalities in charge, then you must be rejected and driven out. I wish that I could say that the hateful characters in this film came across as cartoonish, but the fact is that they do not- they are perfect examples of the American norm. Even the more intelligent and sympathetic characters, such as Mary Steenburgen's character, participate in the dehumanization by mindlessly following the rules like good \\"professionals.\\"  So, what you have here are the two extremes of human evolution, the god-like man, and the ape-like majority.<br /><br />While it is the writing and message that stands out in this film, the special effects and the quality of dramatic acting are also far above the average. There are scenes here that you never forget: the father's rejection in the hospital, the \\"friends don't\\" scene in the councilor's office, the wedding ring scene, the dying deer scene.... Any one of them would have made a film memorable, but all together they make this a classic.<br /><br />The film isn't all together depressing by any means. It is about hope. It shows what man may yet become, by contrasting the ideal with the all-too-prevalent current state of the species. As Jeff Goldblum states at the end, \\"I see you and I think that one day our humanity may one day surpass our technology.\\"<br /><br />I've found that there are few neutral opinions on this movie- people tend to either love it or hate it. The people that hate it seem to have a problem with the basic humanity and honesty of the character- they want to attack him too. Watch it with a friend- it will tell you if that person is worth keeping as a friend....have a problem with the basic humanity and honesty of the character- they want to attack him too.

B00009Z574|3.0|Nowhere near the disappointment of DRAMA or TALK, TORMATO is nonetheless quite a letdown after the brilliant GOING FOR THE ONE. it's a pity, as &quot;Mardigal&quot; and &quot;Onward&quot; and &quot;On the Silent Wings of Freedom (partially)&quot; hold up well after all this time, and the bonus material here is actually better than what the official selections were. &quot;Abilene&quot; is great. In fact, taken as a whole, tracks 9 through 17 are much better than the official album.<BR>Among the big problems here is Wakeman. His synth sounds are grating and shrill. His contributions really disturb the flow throughout this CD. &quot;Don't Kill the Whale&quot; is just a huge mistake start to finish and Anderson should never be forgiven for articulating allow as AElauw. Wakemen's solo is so annoying that I remember throwing away the first pressing of this I had. From the notes it is clear that neither he nor Howe could manage to get their hat sizes to shrink. Some of the subject matter is Anderson at his loopiest: &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Arriving UFO&quot;. By this stage in the game, Eddie Offord's absence was really showing. They seemed to have no compass. This is what punk was rebelling against. The smashed tomato is appropriate, whether intended that way originally or not.<BR>And yet, listen to &quot;Madrigal&quot; and &quot;Onward&quot; and there are just supreme accomplishments to be found as well.<BR>In any case, this would do them in. DRAMA was to follow, as low a point as they would hit.<BR>At the price offered, it is worth picking up for the bonus stuff, more than the original material. How many CDs can you say that about?
B000002LEE|5.0|The good news is that Jane Bainter, the Perry/Casey associate whose addiction led to the band's name, did get and stay clean, and apparently she also eventually got to Spain, too.<br />Nothing's Shocking is as much a piece of Art as a cutting edge Thinking Person's Metal album. This is even reflected in the utterly haunting cover photo of a Perry Farrell sculpture of a pair of naked Siamese Twins with their heads on fire, sitting on a wicker chair. <br />As many of you will know, the 'Twins' were made from a papier mache body cast of Perry's then girlfriend, the remarkable Casey Niccoli, which was then duplicated and fused. Whatever its origins, it is an unforgettable image and naturally caused major controversy on the album's release.<br />Musically, Nothing's Shocking includes some of Jane's best work, although apparently the band wrote most of the material for their first three albums when they first got together. <br />The stunningly beautiful 'Jane Says' went on to become one of the most played Rock ballads of all time, along with U2's 'One' and Led Zeppelin's 'Thank You' and 'Stairway To Heaven'.<br />Yet this album also contains such powerhouse numbers as Ocean Size, Mountain Song and Pigs In Zen (Pigs, not on the original vinyl - not my UK copy, anyway) which can just about blow the doors off any competition you could name.<br />If I recall correctly, Ted Just Admit It was recorded while serial killer Ted Bundy was still around, and was all the more chilling because of that fact. <br />Rather than babble further, I would just ask you to give this rare work of genius a listen, and savor the breathtaking combination of Perry Farrell's unique and hypnotic vocals, Dave N's brilliantly inventive guitar work and as classic a collection of songs as you will ever get on one album.<br />'Just Because' from the new album is a reminder of the awesome power that the band can still wield, but this album right here, is the one that put them on the map.
B00009Z576|2.0|The line up here should have just called themselves DRAMA. As Yes, this was a failure, the one listenable track being essentially a Jon Anderson knock off. The songs don't hold up well, and really apart from tracks 13 thru 16, which show you where Anderson might have taken the band, there is little point in this CD. Squire and Howe are not strong enough on their own to carry YES forward. It was good that Wakeman was out and Downes and Horn do their best, but they were essentially standing in. That role suited neither of them. Downes went on to ASIA, Horn went to the control room. <BR>Back then, it was generally assumed YES was dead in the water. Thankfully, Squire and White found Rabin and Kaye. Out of the ashes of DRAMA came 90125.
B0001AP12G|5.0|20 TRACKS OF REEL RAP. BUT I THINK KANYE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT THE HELP OF TWISTA AND SLO JAMZ.. <BR>HE NEEDS 2 PUT A NEW SINGLE OUT, THRU DA WIRE IZ GETIN OLD.
B0000029DD|5.0|I never thought I would like Jeff Buckley until I went to Memphis the weekend he drowned.  I didn't go to see him, I went to Beale street to carouse.  Everywhere- I could not escape the sound of his voice.  It is impossible for me to see how anyone could not be obsessed with this album.  <br />Grace embodies everything about the early nineties that I want to remember, and everything I want to forget... nothing in between.  The sentiments in the lyrics and the passion of the voice behind them resonate like nothing else.  <br />\\"Last Goodbye\\" was the commercial hit- rightfully so, it was catchy and well executed.   But the backbone of the album is the second track, \\"Mojo Pin\\".  Killer riffs- the album should've opened with this instead of \\"Grace\\"... \\"Mojo Pin\\" is more of a beginning.  Also, the sexy, bittersweet \\"Lover, you should have come over\\" hits lyrically and plays with falsetto and vibrato while making you almost feel his breath on your next.<br />The covers, \\"Corpus Christi carol\\" and \\"Halleujiah\\" are mindnumbingly good, excrutiatingly real versions, but his talent shines more on the songs he penned himself.  <br />The hardest track, \\"Eternal Life\\" is among the more foreshadowed (along with \\"So Real\\") of what would happen after Memphis. \\"Eternal Life\\" has guts to it, like Jeff was able to stop sounding so restrained on the rest of the ablum.  Then again, I don't think anyone was ready for his raw voice in full when the album was originally released.  I know I wasn't.<br />This is touted the first studio album by our generations most pronising rock star- too bad we forget that Jeff never lived to be the rock star.  It's terrible to think that for such an infinite grace, we only have a finiite volume of his life and his music.
0066620996|5.0|In his latest book, Jim Collins, coauthor of &quot;Built To<BR>Last&quot;, explores the secrets behind consistently<BR>successful companies he terms \\"great.\\"  To be<BR>classified as \\"great,\\" the company needs to have made<BR>the leap from average to great results and sustained<BR>it for at least fifteen years.  Surprisingly few<BR>companies meet this criteria.  Collins worked with a<BR>research team to study and discover what common<BR>management elements long-term great companies share.<BR>This book presents the results of this study and some<BR>startling findings.  <br />The first common element among the great companies is<BR>that the CEO is a low-profile, no-nonsense individual<BR>and he/she creates an environment of teamwork.<BR>Supporting this approach is the standard of having<BR>capable, motivated staff in every position in the<BR>company.  Collins terms this, &quot;having the right people<BR>on the bus and in the right seats.&quot;  He noted the<BR>successful CEO's made crucial changes to their staffs<BR>as soon as they attained their positions.  Only highly<BR>motivated and capable individuals were on their team.<br />Once this foundation was in place, the teams met<BR>consistently to contemplate just three criteria that<BR>would drive the company.  Collins terms this simple<BR>strategy, &quot;The Hedgehog Concept.&quot;  The criteria are:<BR>the company focuses on a goal in which they could be<BR>number one in the industry, the goal is something <BR>about which the team feels passionate, and the goal<BR>is clear and concise.  In each case study presented,<BR>this focus brought about amazing clarity on the<BR>operation of the business, directly leading to<BR>success. <br />Collins' study specifically started with companies<BR>that were just average before making the leap to <BR>great.  However, the principles can be applied to<BR>multiple situations.  Whether you are an entrepreneur<BR>or working within a corporate structure, this book<BR>provides insightin how to better reach your goals.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|The songs are great, the artwork is great, and Cannibal Corpse is great. I've been a fan for seven years and own most everything they have done, and I think that some of the best songwriting in death metal came from Gore Obsessed. They are also the tightest live band I've ever seen. But ever since they've been recording with Brian Slagel, their production has sounded like garbage. I really had my fingers crossed that they wouldn't be working with this guy again for this project. Let's put it this way... Sadness will Prevail by Today is the Day sounds better than this. Maybe my hearing is gone, but the Wretched Spawn sounds to me like a TIN CAN. Please find this band a new engineer. Now GO BUY IT!! Along with &quot;Deleted Symphony for the Beaten Down&quot; by Soilent Green.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Earth is under attack by gigantic bugs from the planet Klendathu. They are hurling meteors at us from millions of miles away. It's up to our fighting men and women to battle them on their home turf before they destroy our entire planet. Uh-Oh! We sorely underestimated our enemy, causing mass casualties and destruction of our federation ships! Casper Van Dien is Johnny Ricco, up and coming super-soldier. Watch as he climbs the ranks due to the unfortunate deaths of his superiors. Jake Busey is Ace Levy, smart-alec extraordinare and Ricco's right hand man. Denise Richards is Carman Ibanez, ex-love interest of Ricco and starship pilot. Dina Meyer is Dizzy Flores, excellent infantry fighter and the one who truly loves Ricco. STARSHIP TROOPERS is an ultra-violent, purposely-over-the-top, political satire, using sci-fi as the vehicle for it's message. Taken at this level, it lampoons government propaganda as masterfully as ROBOCOP skewered violence-obsessed society. The characters are all beautiful people, doing their overly-heroic duties, taking on a hideous enemy for the good of mankind. They are living, breathing advertisements for their warmongering government / society! Director, Paul Verhoeven has created one of the best satires of recent memory, and taken a lot of heat for his efforts. How can anyone NOT see his motivation? Anyway, for those who simply want entertainment, it's also a great monster movie! The bugs are realistic enough to cause terror. They are split into five castes or ranks. First, there are the mantis-like \\"soldier bugs\\", with crushing/tearing mandibles and spiked forearms for piercing. Next are the flying bugs, capable of decapitating or impaling a victim. Then, there are the immense \\"tank bugs\\" (about the size of an apartment building), with the ability to shoot flaming acid from their mouths and jets of exploding plasma from their abdomens. This plasma goes into outer space and blows up many of our ships. We are also introduced to the smaller,scurrying \\"attendant bugs\\", catering to the final caste, the \\"brain bugs\\", which have high intelligence and are hidden deep underground. Ricco and the rest of the military must find a way to overcome this relentless horde of doom. ST has elements to offend just about anyone's sensibilities. It's visuals are visceral. It's agenda is sneaky, as it shows a society split into similar castes as it's insectile foe. The fascist undertones are striking, yet easily glossed over by the heroism and patriotism of the main characters. I know people who are either pro-war or anti-war. One thing they have in common, is the love they have for this movie. I highly recommend it, but pay attention to the R-rating! It is well earned...
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Oscar nominee Diane Keaton stars with her old friend Jack Nicholson in the film about learning to play with kids your own age. A test disc looked fine despite speckles here and there. Audio was just OK. Director Nancy Meyers does separate commentary tracks with her two stars. Keaton doesn't start talking until 40 minutes into the movie (until her brief nude scene has safely passed). \\"That's a fiction!\\" Keaton says at one point, as her character walks toward the camera, gorgeous and dressed to kill. \\"It is you -- there are no special effects,\\" Meyers assures the famously shy actress. Fans of Keaton and Nicholson will get a kick out of comparing the actors' comments about their extended lovemaking scene. Keaton talks mostly about how embarrassed she was -- Nicholson is so precise about the acting techniques he used it seems as if he's pulling our legs.
1563890119|5.0|It's a little sad after reading the Sandman books because you know you will never quite recapture the same feeling of going through such a great story for the first time when you pick them again. And trust me, you will be rereading these.<br />But the flip side of that is once you have read the series and go back, you see how fully realized Neil Gaiman's vision is. What seems like almost arbitrary bits of exposition are the seeds of future story arcs. &quot;Season of Mists&quot; the fourth book in the series, being just one example.<br />The main story begins when a necromancer who, intending to capture Death, captures her little brother Dream instead. He and his son keep him locked up for the better part of the 20th century. Once &quot;Sandman&quot; breaks out, he must restore his dream kingdom and reclaim his talismans of power. That takes him to London, Hell and a 24hr diner outside of Gotham.<br />What I love particularly about this series is that it is esoteric without being pretentious. This is what happens when someone who is remarkably well read is also a comic fan. Gaiman manages to invoke The Old Testament, William Faulkner, old DC Comic mythos, Shakespeare, Bobby Darin, Victorian Literature and Greek Tragedy, makes it relevant to the story, and then makes the concepts comprehensible to a fifteen year old. And that's just in this volume. I say the last because that's how old I was when I started to read these. At the risk of sounding overzealous, it has since challenged me to become as well read as the author.<br />I've read other reviews arguing that this is not the best one. I disagree only because I know that each volume speaks differently to different people. My humble advice is to start with this one and read them in order the way the author wrote them. I have bought this particular volume three times over the years due to lending it out to friends and not getting it back. Treasure this as well, enjoy and don't lend them out!
0790749815|5.0|Some strange, witless, mentally challenged reviewers want this film to be serious, logical, with a believable plot. How Vandam dim dumb can you get? There isn't a single Hitchcock film with a halfway realistic, believable story. Vertigo? Psycho? Strangers on a Train? Notorious? The Man Who Knew Too Much? Laughable. That's not what he's about. He sells entertainment, often with a dollop of Freudianism thrown in. I'm not sure he believed in Freud, either, but in any case in this film the Viennese witchdoctor takes a back seat --- except for the last shot. And the mother, of course. This is just a very funny film, and the jokes, visual and scripted, are great. The set-ups are goofy, hilarious, and they stay that way. Like the secret service committee man says, why does he feel like laughing?  It's  The Big Lebowski of the 1950s: a man of his time who hasn't grown up gets dislocated out of his normal pointless, aimless existence. Grant even mentions bowling balls. Madison Avenue, for heaven's sake: ROT, and the O stands for nothing. The red-capped station baggage-handler clone scene was stolen by Nabokov a couple of years later for his comic masterpiece, Pale Fire. This is probably Cary Grant's most perfect role.
B00006879E|5.0|It would be very hard to type-cast Maroon 5 into a specific genre. The Songs about Jane CD is an awesome buy. I heard &quot;This Love&quot; on MTV while channel surfing and HAD to go back to listen to the music video! The music is funky, rock-pop, with a bit of alternative r&amp;b. They were awesome Live (on SNL)... a feat not often done! Second to &quot;This Love&quot;, I'd have to say my favorite was &quot;Shiver.&quot;. . no, wait, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;.. no, wait, hell.. they're all good.
0385504209|1.0|there is not much to say about this book except that it is a total rip-off of \\"the book of light\\" by Michelle Simons.  The davinci code uses the exact same premise of the book of light, exept it is written in the style of a 3 year old, it makes sense why it appeals to so many.  If you read other low star reviews it explains my reasoning.  I do not hae the time to tell you why.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Oh mane, if you don't have this CD in your collection you have GOT to cop this..the new drop is close to all of my expectations, the beats are so cold (as if we wouldn't have expected this) and Kayne is a genius in the booth and with the pen. All i can say is ROCafella has done it again, so don't bootleg this CD: get out and support my boy Kanye and prepare to vibe to some seriously cold tracks, if there's one CD that you must have in your collection this year, it's this no doubt.
0804106304|5.0|This was one of our summer reading novels for junior A.P Literature. (Advanced Placement). The novel is great. It touches one's soul and has many, many life lessons. It is divided into four mothers and their four daughters, each telling their story and the stories intertwine as well. The novel in itself is a lesson of growing up, acceptance, and remembering where one came from. The question presented is- who am I? How do I blend the old with the new? Minorities like myself can relate really well to the problems of a &quot;double life&quot;. It's great for a mother and daughter to each read. This is the only novel for school that I couldn't put down. I read it in three days.
0440237688|5.0|I found this to be truly incredible book. It is able to display effectively why individuality should be celebrated and how a society that encourages sameness will only force it's members to a sort of pointless existence. It also gives a rather meaningful life lesson. That without feeling the true pain and anguish that life has to offer, you cannot feel the full extent of its love and happiness either. It offers a sense of extremes that everyone is meant to meet and deal with in order to fully appreciate what they have. Without that balance between the very bad in our lives and the very good, we lead a mundane existence, because we don't know how to truly know emotion and live.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|When I first listened to this recording my first thought was &quot;this reminds me of the gladiator soundtrack.&quot; In a way it does but it is Gladiator with a much more lusher and more dramatic flair to it.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Buy this CD. Its the best from them yet. Great production and high quality technical death metal are good things. Its really gross as well.
B0001AP12G|5.0|manye this whole cd was tight to me i mean the beats were sick as well as the lyrics   the joint with mos def and the harlem boys choir tight  the song spaceship was also a good one my favorite on the whole cd is  the last song lastcall in a over all summary the cd was tight
0312995423|1.0|I read Angels and Demons first. Then I read The Da Vinci Code. Both were good. Not because they were well written, but because they had interesting story lines. But, both of those books were predictable. But the WORST book he has written so far is Digital Fortress. I knew the &quot;who-dunnit&quot; in the first quarter of the book and read the rest in case I was wrong. I wasn't. Unfortunatly, Mr. Brown only gave you one character that knew all the details. And that character was, of course, the guilty party. I was actually mad by the time I finished the book. <BR>Another little issue I don't like are the clumsy suspense attempts. I hate knowing I am not given information to make me read more pages. If it's seamless, it's great. When it's not (and it's not), it stinks.<BR>Beware. Da Vinci Code is good, but this book is not even worth the six dollars.
B00011V8CW|5.0|A forgotten classic by Mr. Bowie. People tend to say, &quot;Best Album since Scary Monsters.&quot; This album isn't the best sinc ce Sccary Monsters (Lets Dance and Tin Machine were pretty good too!) but it is a Great Bowie Album. If you appreciate Bowie's talents and his musical tastes, then you'll love this album. Music is flawless!!
B00008EYA5|3.0|First watching &quot;SWAT&quot;, I was expecting something completely predictable, the usual summer fare that never stands up to its overhyped release. And perhaps this film fits that description, as it is a two-hour long clichee mixed in with every cop stereotype there is, but I have to admit that it was not that bad. Although I do not like to make comparisons, this film is on the same level as &quot;Bad Boys 2&quot;, with one major difference: &quot;SWAT&quot; is pretty entertaining, while &quot;BB2&quot; fell flat on its face in every sense of filmmaking. <br />The actors here are the usual gaggle of predictability, but Colin Farrel is actually pretty good, and not as over-the-top as I was expecting him to be. The rest of the stereotypes play their roles fine, without anyone standing out or completely stinking the place up. <br />The plot is a little different for a summer film, namely because there seems to be one. The film could easily be split into two halves, the first being the recruitment and training of the new team, and the second being their first action, involving a Frenchman who offers a $100 Million bounty to whoever can help him escape from prison. This of course brings the greedy hoods out of the woodwork, and much shooting ensues. <br />There is nothing new in this movie, but overall, it is pretty decent, much better than alot of the summer fare, including that other overhyped cop flick of the summer of 2003.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Without Ziggy, Bowie would have never been accepted by the mainstream. Even though his previous works showed his genius, Ziggy showed how far he could go with that Genius. A Space Glam rock album about a gender bending Guitar hero! All of the songs are dynomite! You won't regret this purchase! Bowie forever!
B000002I2G|5.0|For all the critical backlash the Doors received for their experimental album, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, we can look back at it now and wish that there still existed in rock and roll a willingness to push the envelope instead of continually sticking with what works. This is a classic album, showing a band reaching as far as it could to change music for the better. The sound here is much thicker, and there is the use of many more instruments than their previous albums, including a full orchestra. <br />Classic songs here include the hit &quot;Touch Me&quot;, &quot;Tell All the People&quot;, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; and the more stripped-down &quot;Wild Child&quot;. Maybe this album is not their best, as I believe this to be their final album, &quot;LA Woman&quot;, but &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; now deserves to be recognized in the annals of rock as a classic. Sure, this disc might be the definition of rock excess, a band thinking they were greater than they were, but this does not hold true for the Doors. Decades after their demise, they seem to keep GAINING popularity, showing that the Doors were every bit as great as they thought they were. Instead of displaying the excess, this album now is the frontier of a new place for rock music, one that has not been successfully ventured into before. <br />All I can say is that there are many great songs on this album, and the concept of expansion is brilliant. I can only wish that there were more bands today that were willing to take a critical hit and try something completely new, even when they have a formula that exists, and is successful.
0446677450|1.0|Robert Kiyosaki is a charlatan and a quack who has built a franchise selling false hope to those who can least afford it.  As a CPA, Sharon Lechter should be ashamed of herself and possibly have her license revoked.  I do however agree with Kiyosaki on one thing-- he is a terrible writer (pg 132).
B000000H83|5.0|Okay first i would like to mention that obituary is one awsome old school deathmetal band that i have supported since their  start... I haven't been dissapointed with any of their work yet!I find &quot;Cause of death&quot; to be my favorite obituary album and not  to mention one masterpiece that will be remenber for years &amp; years to come. If you want to learn about deathmetal and it's roots... Begin here!  The good old days are surely missed *sigh*. I hope  mtv fades out one day because i realy cant stand it any more!! Send all teenypoppers  to the gates of hell and let them burn alive there!!! Deathmetal will never die! Latersss!

B000069AUI|5.0|A simply flawless work from start to finish. Although I am wary of any artists in the \\"mainstream\\", which seem to produce more hype then inspired art, Coldplay is by far one band which is deserving of the awards and acclaim this album has generated.  Original, imaginative, and passionate, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is one of the most polished and purely enjoyable albums to come around in a long time. Destined to be a classic.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|oh man, this movie is wonderful.  <br />i just read a top 500 reviewer say this movie wasn't good.  when i went to see what else this person had reviewed, i noticed they gave scooby-doo 5 stars.  <BR>so now you know you shouldn't listen to THAT person.<br />i simply couldn't take my eyes off this movie.  it answers all of your questions, you just have to be smart enough to know when it does.  and i thought the acting and script were good.  <br />buy it.
B000060P79|4.0|All i have to say is WOW.  I love this cd so much.  Its not often that i find a cd that i like every song on it.  I would definately recommend this cd.
B00005JMCN|4.0|But after the first 20-30 minutes, it began to pick up from there.<br />At first, this movie felt more like a documentary, due to the cutscenes where an almost monotone narrator talks about important dates in early 1900's U.S. history. Some of the cutscenes seem to have no relation to the movie whatsoever, though, and could distract people from the actual storyline.<br />However, everything began to pick up when the three different characters' storylines that we follow became more and more tragic until they are united by the fourth character, Seabiscuit - the small and nearly broken down horse with a sad early life. The thing that bothered me about the sudden addition of Seabiscuit was that the movie explained his life in a few short minutes, instead of having it be a continual storyline from the beginning of the movie, like the automotive salesperson, the horse trainer, and the jockey.<br />The storyline continues with more challenges and more tragedy for all the characters, that I was left cheering for all of them to succeed in their fight against their misfortune. This movie develops all of the main characters very well so it was easy to sympathize with them.<br />Also, the races were more exciting than I anticipated, leaving me and my fellow viewer at the edge of our seats, cheering Seabiscuit on. This movie also left a nice message about how it's not all about the race and winning, but how the characters were all brought together and changed their life around - for the better.<br />This movie delivers its more than two-hour performance very well and wraps up everything nicely. Highly recommended.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd deserves 10 stars. Every track is tight, all the tracks have krunk beats. Everybody in America needs to go cop this album. DO NOT BOOTLEG DIS ALBUM!!! Go out and buy this album, it is worth every penny. Kanye, to me makes some veteran rappers sound like trash!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The white stripes are one of the most talented bands out there today. Their raw sound and musical talent set them appart from all the other &quot;rock&quot; bands around now. The lyrics are honest and interesting and Jack is nasty on his guitar. It offers 14 eclectic tracks ranging from blues, hard rock, grunge, folkish stuff, and even a rocking cover of &quot;I don't know what to do with myself.&quot; The tracks are...<br />seven nation army:Awesome song with one of the most recognizable bass lines of 2003 10/10<br />Black Math: Great fast paced song with cool lyrics 9/10<br />There's no Home for you Here: A little slower song with a unique sound. 7/10<br />I just don't know what to do with myself: Jack puts his own spin on this classic and really hits those high notes. 8/10<br />In the Cold, Cold Night: First song that meg gets to sing (jack wrote it though). It's a very chill song, but not one of their best. Her voice is only ok. 6/10<br />I want to be the boy to warm your mother's<BR>heart: While this song tends not to be people's favorite, I really like the piano in the background of this song and think that it is very sweet and original. 8/10<br />You've got her in your Pocket: Another more gentle track on this CD to balance out the harder rock stuff. Sweet song and nice acoustic guitar. 8/10<br />Ball and a Biscuit: I love this song! Very raunchy, bluesy, and old school. It is the longest track on the CD clocking in at 7:19, but I would love it even if it were longer. Jack shows off his talent with long (and amazing) guitar solos. 10/10<br />Hardest Button to Button: Very cool song and lyrics. The bass on the drum is awesome. 9/10<br />Little Acorns: one of the more grunge songs on the CD. Jack's voice is very cool on this one, and it has really cool verses with a rocking chorus. 8/10<br />Hypnotize: This one has a very retro feel to it. Simple tune, but still good. 8/10<br />The Air Near My fingers: The is a very cool upbeat-ish song with a really nice beat.Also, has cool lyrics.  9/10<br />Girl, you have no faith in medicine: Not one of my favorites, but has really good guitar playing and a quick pace. 7/10<br />Well, it's rule that we love one another: A cute ending to the CD. A folk-ish tune between jack, meg, and holly (a cousin) with funny lyrics. 8/10
B0000AUHPB|3.0|I gave the remake of this movie a much higher rating, and the main reason is that it simply has a better plot. Michael Cain is wonderful in the original, and some of the other outrageous characters as well as the pretty original plotline together should be the ingredients for an unforgettable film, yet this one leaves you really unsatisfied, maybe because it really never decides what it wants to be: satire, comedy, serious heist movie or thriller, so it ends up being unsatisfying on all accounts. See it for the brilliant chase scene with the mini coopers, and view it also as a sensitive mood piece of 60ies swank.
B00005AFMT|5.0|I have listened to King Crimson for an eternity, and the thing I have always enjoyed most about the band (which, naturally, means Robert Fripp) is his fear of repeating himself. So... after going through a number of lineup and sound changes in the late 60's and 70's, Fripp assembles a new band (with only the excellent Bill Bruford from earlier KC lineups) to make an album that takes what he did on &quot;Red&quot; and shapes it into something different... and very satisfying!<BR>  Although this CD has been called &quot;poppy,&quot; I wonder what is so pop sounding about &quot;The Sheltering Sky,&quot; &quot;Discipline,&quot; or even &quot;Elephant Talk?&quot; These songs may sound more mainstream than &quot;Earthbound&quot; (OK... enough of the Earthbound jokes), but there is nothing I have heard in this genre that sounds ANYTHING like this.<BR>  Adrian Belew has seemed to finally find a place where he can take his enormous talent, his more-than-adequate singing, and his wit and intelligence and fit in. As I have listened to this CD (after I wore out a vinyl copy) for 20 years, I still have not grown tired of this wonderful music. Although it is a bit short, there is not a weak track on the entire set.<BR>  For those of you who have not heard this CD, prepare yourself for a wonderful treat. And make sure you have the volume cranked when &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; is playing. I still get shivers when I hear that song!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This movie takes the few very cool elements of the sixties cult classic with Michael Cain and incorporates them into a breathtaking thriller. The story is a classic heist, but has thief vs. thief betrayal thrown into it. Mark Wahlberg gives a solid performance, Ed Norton once again is superb as the smart  and wicked bad guy they go after and unfortunately we see far too little of the wonderful Donald Sutherland. And of course there is the mini-Cooper, the other star of this movie. Like in the sixties original, this swank vehicle (here of course in its new millenium reincarnation) plays a central role in the whole ploy. The special effects and cinematography leave you breathless, the locations are well-picked, this is an edge-of-the-seat wonderfully entertaining flic.
B00008NG5V|3.0|Jack Johnson is a talented musician, but he's yet to show just how talented he is.  He needs more variety.  This album is great if you just want something chill playing in the background, but it's not worth really listening to.<br />The problem is not that there are any bad songs on this CD.  In fact, every song on it is good.  But they all sound the same.  I have a hard time distinguishing one Jack Johnson song from any other.  And this CD sounds no different from Brushfire Fairytales, which suffers the same problem.  The bass lines, guitar riffs, and melodies are all so similar that it gets really boring.<br />Jack Johnson is talented though.  He has some great lyrics.  It's just really unfortunate that the songs aren't different enough to make it worth listening to.  Maybe if there were less songs, it wouldn't be so bad, but 16 tracks of the same thing over and over again is not what I call an outstanding album.  I hope he branches out for his next one and writes some songs that really establish themselves as different.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Russel Crowe lights up the screen in this epic tale of freedom, love, and courage. It begins with Crowe's character, Maximus, as the masterful general of the roman army, under emperor Marcus Aurilious. He is looked upon as a second son to the emperor, even first ahead of Marcus' blood son, Commodus, who is played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix.<br />  When Commodus learns that his father wishes for Maximus to be the next emperor over him, he murders his father before the word can get out, not knowing that Maximus had been told that he was to be emperor, and by Marcus Aurilious himself.<br />  So Commodus secretly orders for Maximus to be put to death, getting rid of any threat to his heir to the throne. And along with that, he has Maximus' wife and son put to death. But Maximus, the skilled fighter that he is, escapes and when finding his family dead he wanders off into the desert and passes out. It is then that he is found and sold into slavery, now as a mighty gladiator.<br />  While in the mighty arena, he begins to plot when he can escape back to his faithful army and seek venegace upon Commodus, and make Rome the way Marcus Aurilious wanted it to be. And when he wins the crowd, and nearly all of Rome, it looks like his time may soon come.<br />  Believe me, my desciption cannot even start to hit the mighty surface of this great movie. You have to see it for yourself. Believe me, the fighting, although sometimes gorey, is wonderfully done, as are the special effects. And this might be one of the top three movies that ever had such great acting by EVERY character. Usually every movie has at least one weak link, but this movie has none. Even Commodus' ten year old nephew has better acting than some people.<br /><br />  This is a great movie, and I suggest you get it ASAP. It will not only keep you in suspense, it will not only thrill you, it will not only keep you in three hours of delight, but it will really find a place in your heart as a wonderfully touching film.<br />  P.S. the soundtrack, in it's spooky kind of tone, is very well doneilm. <br />   P.S. the soundtrack, in it's spooky kind of tone, is very well done
B00004BZ0N|4.0|About 85-90% of The Clash's songs are extremly good. If you're into oldschool punk or new wave, then The Clash is something to add to your collection. Their number 1 hit song that was heard most by people (UK and America), London Calling, is obviously on this CD.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh is such an extraordinary talent and deserves more than what some of the reviewers are offering. I went and bought his debut CD yesterday. So now I have both his self-titled album and &quot;Closer.&quot; I can really hear how much he has grown as an artist. It's quite impressive. <br />I regret not buying the first album sooner. But if I had, I never would have listened to anyone else. I recall gazing upon it at Best Buy after the Winter Olympics. How foolish I was. I played the clip of \\"Alla Luce Del Sole\\" from Amazon.com yesterday and I almost melted. I said to myself, \\"Girl, you better run out and get this.\\" So I did. Now, I'm ruined forever.<br />\\"Closer\\" will undeniably get you hooked on this artist. From the moment you hear \\"Oceano\\" you will be swept away. His voice takes you on an emotional ride that draws you closer upon each listen. Everything he sings resonates so deeply.<br />Don't wait like I did. It took me two years to fall for Josh Groban. Way too long. You don't want to end up hoping and wishing that you had witnessed this talent earlier. Buy \\"Closer\\" and \\"Josh Groban\\" while you can still get your hands on them.<br />\\"Closer\\" Favorites:<BR>#1 Oceano<BR>#3 Mi Mancherai<BR>#5 When You Say You Love Me<BR>#6 Per Te<BR>#8 Broken Vow<BR>#12 You Raise Me Up<br />\\"Josh Groban\\" Favorites:<BR>#1 Alla Luce Del Sole\\"<BR>#2 Gira Con Me Questa Notte<BR>#5 To Where You Are<BR>#7 Canto Alla Vita<BR>#8 Let Me Fall<BR>#12 Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I've read alot of inane ramblings about how awful or angry or different this CD is. If you dont have anything good to say. Please keep it to yourself. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion, but we don't need to be insulting or mean spirited just because something is not of our taste. Its easy to throw insults around from your comfy arm-chair. Get out there and do better.<BR>   For me, Dream Theater, Explorers Club, Shadow Gallery and of coarse Liquid Tension have been a Godsend over the last 15-20 years. Growing up on The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Yes, Rush, Al Stewart, Mahogany Rush, Wishbone Ash, Deep Purple. The 80s and 90s were pretty void of true musicianship for the sake of melody, ability and technical prowess.<BR>   This CD seems like the next logical step for this band. We dont want the same CD redone over and over. We would'nt have wanted the Beatles to keep make SGT PEPPER over and over and well as Pink Floyd doing Dark Side over and over. Got to keep it fresh, new and push the envelope, always. Thats what progressive rock is all about. As far as this CD being angry, Write what you know or where your at in life, and maybe there angry(if thats your perseption) because of all the negitive remarks people write.<BR>   Its a great CD, its hard, its fast and it will take your breath away. I am seeing them March 2nd @ the Moore. They Rock.

B000001DYJ|5.0|In examining the content of Alive III, made sixteen years since Alive II, I can't help but be struck by several differences that set this apart from the previous two live albums.  One, the emphasis is on the newer material, appropriate because the previous live albums took material from the three albums prior, but with a few classics mixed in.  Two, of the material following Dynasty, the songs aren't evenly mixed.  There is no material from Asylum and Crazy Nights (and Unmasked and The Elder for obvious reasons), only one from Dynasty, Lick It Up, Animalize, and Hot In The Shade, while Creatures is represented thrice--the title track, the ballad &quot;I Still Love You,&quot; and the song that defines how KISS fans love it, &quot;I Love It Loud,&quot; with its savage tribal drumbeat that drive the fans nuts.<br />The result is a hybrid live greatest hits with an emphasis on Revenge, the most recent studio album before this live album.  That album is represented by four selections.  &quot;Man, it's time for the good, the bad, and the ugly&quot; proclaims Stanley just before he launches into theopening lyrics for &quot;I Just Wanna,&quot; where Stanley really plays on the innuendo found in the breaking forget mid-syllable in &quot;I just wanna forget you.&quot;  He gets the audience to say &quot;f---&quot; after he sings &quot;I just wanna...&quot;  That is immediately followed by Gene singing &quot;Unholy.&quot;  Then there's that &quot;man-sized predicament&quot; named &quot;Domino&quot; which was one of Revenge's best tracks and whose inclusion here was a wise move.  The other is the cover of Argent's &quot;God Gave Rock And Roll To You II,&quot; the studio version of which also was on the Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey soundtrack.<br />Some of KISS's well-known songs have familiar openings.  &quot;You oughta know this one,&quot; proclaims Paul before the chugging intro of &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You&quot; a song well-received by the crowd despite its reputation as a quasi-disco song when first released.  A worthy inclusion, since I have no quarrel with it, and there are some pyrotechnic booms heard toward the end of the song.<br />&quot;Here's a song you'll know by the beginning.  OH yeah, I know that one!&quot;  &quot;Heaven's On Fire&quot; is given the long-waited live treatment on CD.  Given Mark St. John's guitar on the studio version, I'm a bit ambivalent on the live version here, but in comparison, &quot;Lick It Up&quot; is a live triumph outdoing the studio version.<br />Of the makeup era tracks, they do &quot;Deuce,&quot; &quot;Watchin' You,&quot; &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You,&quot; &quot;Rock N Roll All Nite,&quot; and uh... what was the name of that song, oh yeah, &quot;Detroit Rock City.&quot; (ha ha)  It's interesting to hear these done with the then-current lineup of Stanley/Simmons/Kulick/Singer and comparing Frehley with Kulick.  The rendition of &quot;Rock N Roll All Nite&quot; outdoes the one on Alive! in terms of energy, while &quot;Deuce&quot; and &quot;Detroit&quot; here ties with the previous live versions.<br />And they do a cover of the Star Spangled Banner, complete with pyrotechnics.  KISS being KISS, they don't attempt any theatrics that Hendrix did at Woodstock.<br />I'll conclude with the similarities between the three live albums.  The songs fulfill the wishes of those unlucky many who missed KISS concerts to hear studio tracks done live.  Also, the live versions really outdo the studio versions, though it's a close contest on &quot;Heaven's On Fire.&quot;<br />This was produced by Eddie Kramer, who did Rock And Roll Over and Love Gun for them.  It would've been nice to hear hard-driving songs like &quot;Any Way You Slice It,&quot; &quot;Love's A Deadly Weapon,&quot; or &quot;When Your Walls Come down,&quot; but can't have everything, right?s a quasi-disco song when first released.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is just the first season , but at least they are Finally releasing some of it! I want a box set NOW!!! I can't wait I LOVE this show!!!!
B00008PW2E|5.0|Finally!  The date is set for June 8th. I cannot believe they took 2 years to do it. <br />This is the most intriguing show I've ever seen. I got addicted to it from the beginning and have not been able to stop. Amazing writing, interesting stories, brilliant acting... What more can you ask for. Characters are actually multidimensional and interesting to watch. I cannot wait to buy this set.<br />Let's hope third season will not take another 2 years to come out.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Give us a break!  All you idiots who keep writing these one line reviews saying the movies are junk, just SHUT UP!  If you used even half your brain you would see that they are good movies, or at least that posting one line criticizing them is dumber than the movies could ever be.  If youre going to criticize a movie, at least give reasons, otherwise youll just prove that youre an idiot compared to those of us that actually give reasons for our opinions.
B00018TI5E|5.0|honestly...spin after spin, it keeps getting better...his best work ever.  a definite endeless form of inspiration and experiemtnal exuberance mysteriously fit into the constraints of a compact disc!<BR>go buy it, buy many copies of it, and give them to random people on the street to aid in their self-enlightenment.
B00000HZH7|5.0|This is a classic CD that is one of the 10 most import metal CDs ever to be released because it spawned an entirely new genre - death metal. I am not much of a fan of the current cookie cutter/cookie monster death metal bands but Possessed got it right way back at the beginning. This CD should also appeal to those who like classic 80s thrash.<br />Jeff Becerra is not a cookie monster vocalist. He has a growling delivery but it is far from cartoonish. He is also capable of delivering quite a shriek. Check out the vocals near the middle of 'Evil Warriors' where he builds into a screaming frenzy - cool. And the piercing crescendo scream \\"Death MetAAAAAAAAAAAL!!!!\\" near the end of that song.<br />The title track starts with a halting, galloping guitar riff, then the vocals, bass and drums kick in and it's so heavy it practically tears your face off.<br />Those are just a handful of highlights, though. Everything on this disc totally annihilates! <br />If you want great production, buy a movie soundtrack. If you want virtuoso musicianship, get a Malmsteen CD, if you want intelligent lyrics, read Shakespeare. If you want a top-notch metal CD that kicks you in the gut every time you listen to it and keeps you coming back for more, get Seven Churches.
B0001AP12G|5.0|kanye is doin' work.  this is the best hip hop cd i've heard in a while.  every song on this cd is on point.  i would say that the skits are kind of annoying though.  his infectious beats make me wonder why more people aren't still sampling these days. i can't stop listening to this, u gotta cop it!

B000002UB3|5.0|I do sincerely hope that \\"Duran Duran's Greatest Fan\\" is having a laugh (or otherwise Simon Le Bon put him on to it). Duran Duran could never release anything that could even match a Beatles song - in fact, the thought of Duran Duran being better than the beatles never really entered my mind! And anyway, the Beatles didn't have rely on risque or explicit video clips (girls on film....) to be famous. And where did those ridiculous popularity figures come from?<BR>How Stupid!!!!!!!!<BR>Duran Duran was merely a group that was following through with \\"New Wave\\" movement.<br />And also to then say that Duran Duran had more talent... WWWWHHHHHAAAAAATTTTTT????<br />You could say that the bottom line is that Golden Slumbers (yes, one singular Beatles Song...) is better than anything Duran Duran ever did.<BR>Need I Say Any More?....

B00004RFFI|1.0|With the advent of advanced CGI, films like 'Twister' were bound to happen.  This is a prime example of effects dominating a movie; the actors and plot are mere appendages.  I didn't care for DeBont's previous film, 'Speed' either-substitute stunts for decent plot in that one.  The whole premise of 'Twister' is bogus:  stormchasers run around after tornadoes, with the leader's (Bill Paxton) difficulties with his wife (Helen Hunt) as a sorry subplot.  The chasers conveniently manage to run into several tornadoes in a very short period of time, which is pretty farfetched.  Real stormchasers will tell you it is very difficult indeed to get close to a single funnel cloud, let alone a bunch of them as portrayed in this film. This movie is evidence that filmgoer objectivity is deteriorating along with the product; if audiences consider this a 'great' movie, it means they don't think of plot and acting as really important-only trees, cows, etc. flying around via CGI effects.  If you want to see a really good movie about a natural disaster, try 'The River' with Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek-it has decent acting along with the destruction.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I love this movie it is the closest thing to the old Woody Allen movies of the seventies. Bill Murray is superb with his trademark bemused expressions, as for Scarlett Johansen she is a very beautiful talented actress with a great future ahead.<BR>They should both win the oscar for best actor/actress.<BR>Also Anna Faris is great as an airhead A list actress, demonstrating her comic potential further from The Scary Movie pictures.<BR>Soffia Coppla is establishing herself as a great director of her father's (old) work. What this movie show's is two people who try to  find what they are looking for in an alien enviroment.<BR>I saw this film in the cinema in London and ordered it on DVD the next day(thank god for multi region).
0316921173|3.0|I thought the book was an interesting experiment and I enjoyed the feeling that I was a part of the whole experiment in writing and being ingulfed in his (clearly) vast and diverse knowledge. So post-post-modernist. I felt like it never fused as a story, though. That's not necessarily an indictment, but I fault the book because I think that it could have been all brought together and been more valuable because of it. But, again, I'm sure Wallace is pleased with his product and doesn't want us to feel satisfied in the least. So, it's worth a read, but don't expect to feel changed after all of the hours you spend with it.
0792164903|5.0|That and other cheery senitments are waiting to be found in director Tim Burtons' &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; an errie, stylish and smart slice modern horror.  Though &quot;Hollow&quot; may not be grab-your-seat-for-dear-life terrifying, the suspense is palpable and if you give the movie a chance, the tension and creepiness slowly seeps into your skin, and stays there.<br />Bouyed by Burton's unmistakeable visual storytelling style, the plot methodically plays out, leading Constable Ichabod Crane (Burton regular Johnny Depp), from his comfort zone of logical reasoning to far more uneasy territory:  A Headless Horseman loose in the small rural town of Sleepy Hollow cutting off heads almost at random...or is he?  Crane if baffled as to the reasons why, but he still finds time to develop a relationship between himself and a local noblewoman (Christina Ricci) while he investigates old grudges and conspiracies that lead to an unexpected, but senisble conclusion.<br />The cast here is outstanding, led by Depp, whom I am enjoying more with every new role I find him in.  His cautious Crane is a far cry from his turn as the flamboyant Jack Sparrow, but Depp is so achingly convincing you forget he ever donned eye-liner and a dingy three-cornered hat.  Ricci is effective, but next to Depp she is unfortunately dwarfed.  Chistopher Lee and Christoper Walken make brief appearances in the film, as a judege and the horsemen respectively.  Lee presides over his court with stately arrogance and Walken is devilishly deranged as the mad Horseman (When the horseman appears with his head of course).<br />Visually the film is wondrous.  The cinematography is breathtaking, giving a surreal gothic look to the film.  Sets are gorgeously designed from the dank town to some very creepy woods.  The film is also superbly edited, and the visual effects are just about seamless.  The horseman sequences are well-executed pieces of CGI (despite the occasional gore, one sees every head sliced off), andCrane's flashbacks to a troubled childhood are a feast for the eyes as well (albeit a bloody one).   But the gore cannot bring down a brilliantly crafted horror story, with a refreshing intelligence that puts most other horror films today to shame.

B0000C9JFO|5.0|\\"L'auberge espagnole\\" was playing at the time I lived in Spain (fall 2002), but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Now, more than a year later after returning home, this charming film made me realize how much I enjoyed my experiences studying in Spain, cherished my friendships with other Erasmus students, and relived the embarrassing \\"fish out of water\\" moments that made my stay so memorable.<br />Directed by C&eacute;dric Klapisch, \\"L'auberge espagnole\\" tells the tale of Xavier (Romain Duris), a twentysomething Parisian studying economics. Xavier decides to spend a year at the Universitat de Barcelona as an Erasmus student (a university exchange between EU member countries), and along the way he meets an assortment of other European students, locals, and transplanted French (a local at a bar offers to teach him \\"puta madre\\" Spanish, which made me laugh out loud.)<br />Xavier arrives in Barcelona disoriented and brokenhearted at having to leave his girlfriend and the comfort of familiarity behind. Weighted down by a myriad of bags (which brought back plenty of memories of my arriving in Spain similarly loaded down), he wanders the unfamiliar streets, alone and friendless, not speaking either language fluently (Castillano, the official language of Spain, and Catal&aacute;n, the official language of Catalunya and Barcelona). After ditching the morose boarding accommodations provided by a friend of his hippie mother's, Xavier begins the grueling and expensive task of finding a flat.<br />His search lands him in a flat with six other Erasmus students: Londoner Wendy (a noted clean freak), Aragonese Soledad, the gorgeous Italian Alessandro, Tobias from Germany, the Dane Lars, and latecomer Isabelle from Belgium. Slowly, Xavier adjusts to his new life: an utter lack of privacy, homesickness for his girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou from Am&eacute;lie), studying, balanced with the occasional joint and night out clubbing. The seven flatmates generally get along, speaking with each other in English and Spanish. A wrench is thrown into the mix when Wendy's obnoxious brother William (Kevin Bishop) comes to spend two weeks with them and ends up offending everyone.<br />Xavier also becomes infatuated with the wife of a French doctor working in Barcelona and the two begin an affair. Although he believes himself to be an adequate lover, Xavier is coached by the lesbian Isabelle on how to truly please a woman, and the result, as Xavier says, is \\"like something from the movies.\\"<br />The film is beautiful to look at, showcasing the architecture of Gaud&iacute; (Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell), the swaying palm trees, blue water and sandy beaches of Barcelona, and Paris at intervals as well.  The film's humor is reflected in the editing, \\"you are here\\" labels, and special effects. The music is an upbeat mix of new and old that perfectly reflects modern Europe, including contributions by Radiohead, Ali Farka Toure, Vicente Amigo, Kouz-1, Daft Punk and the late Arthur Rubinstein.<br />My only complaints would be the lack of extras (there was a made-for-TV documentary of the making of (or \\"making off\\" as you'll see in France and Spain) the film, European Confusion, not included here), and the rather high price. The DVD contains both the widescreen and fullscreen versions.<br />Overall, a gem of a film that brought back many happy memories of living in Spain (Burgos, in my case) and made me homesick for the many wonderful people and experiences I had while living there (I hope to teach in Barcelona in the near future). &iexcl;Viva Espa&ntilde;a!r in English and Spanish.

0385504209|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst novel i have ever read.  The chracters never develop, the plot runs thin and it just isn't belivable enough to me.  It was just Brown's excuse to try and get some money.  I would rather take a hammer to my temple than read this trash again.
6305657939|3.0|2/26/04  For those of us who like knowing the plot and most of the possibilities of the ending ,so that we can just watch the &quot;play&quot; :Act by Act via &quot;scene after scene&quot; : the movie video&quot; The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; was not a disappointment...the fact that it's most &quot;saleable scene&quot;: &quot;a mini tour of the New York Art Museum&quot; opened the plot (Dunaway's conversation with Bronsan  during the opening credit preceded the tour)helped even more..however the movie is no &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; or &quot;War and Peace&quot; ,so a rating of three is parallel to its merits.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a very fascinating book. Lois Lowry creats a very well thought out community without anything that the citicenz can do or think about negative. Everthing has to be preciece and perfect.

B0001HAISG|5.0|I expected a lot from this movie, and it didn't let me down at all. During one particular scene I literally got chills up my spine because it was so powerful. Never before has a simple, classic story been made so profound and thought provoking! I also recommend the soundtrack. The music in this movie added greatly to its charm and feeling. I am going crazy waiting for it to come out on DVD!

B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a wonderful romantic comedy for the over 40 crowd, especially women. The hospital scenes with Harry are hilarious.  While the romance between the Keaton and Revees characters is a bit hard to believe, the Keaton and Nicolas on sceen fire will keep you interested and entertained. Many laughs and a movie to own.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|If you're an intelligent, insightful individual, you'll LOVE this film.<br />If you're an idiot, don't waste your time.....watch pro-wrestling instead.<br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are both brilliant and adorable.  Sophia and her crew have done a terrific job - the cinematography and lighting are beautiful - you can feel the texture of this movie.<br />The bonus features are great (wish there were more) - the interview with Bill and Sophia alone is worth the price of the DVD.<br />I recommend this highly - but only to those of you perched a little higher on the food chain.<br />If you don't understand &quot;nuance&quot; and &quot;subtlety&quot; - stick with easier stuff, ok? 'nuff said.
0790740443|4.0|There are several reviews here which provide a perfectly adequate overview of the movie as a whole, but I want to put in a plug for what is, to me, its greatest appeal.  This was one of the first DVDs I ever watched, and it has the first commentary track I ever listened to.<BR>I am a tremendous admirer of Jason Isaacs, who plays a sneering bully (Col. Mekum) in this movie.  His role is quite small, but he joins Paul Anderson on the director's commentary and reveals himself to be a man of unusual intelligence and wit.  Anderson and the producer, I think, get completely absorbed in self-congratulatory Fanboy minutiae, but I thought Isaacs was hysterically funny.  An unusual treat for that reason.
0385335482|5.0|Becky Bloomwood is what you would call a neighborhood,\\"it\\", girl. She lives in a fashionable area in London by all of the overly expensive brand-name stores.  And yes, she definitely shops there, a little too much. She also has a romantic obstacle with one of the richest men in London named Luke Brandon. They have a...let's say interesting relationship. <br />She works as a financial journalist which is ironic because she fails to acknowledge that she is in way over her head when it comes to her bank account. She buys whatever she wants, when she wants it no matter what. Of course, she is well equipped with excuses such as a broken leg, fever, or dead dog, the list is endless. When a financial story finally comes along that has to deal with her neighbors she is finally interested. Unfortunately it is Luke Brandon's company she has to deal with it. Becky is so determined though; she won't let anything stop her now. She will do whatever it takes to report the facts and get the justice that she wants. <br />One of the main points in this book is facing your fears. Nobody takes Becky seriously and she is determined to make them. She sets goals for herself and works hard to achieve them. Becky gives it her all to turn her life around and be the best person she can be. There were many obstacles that Becky overcame in this book and became girl who knew what she wanted and exactly how to get there. I am not saying that this was easy for her, by no means was it, but she eventually achieved what she wanted. <br />I feel that this book is a great read for teens and above. Sophie Kinsella is a great author and used strong verbs, interior monologue, and cut to the bone. These writers craft tools really make this book clear and exceptional. This is a must read for people who love to see the girl taking charge. GIRL POWER!
6305897786|3.0|Style over substance is the key in ROMAN POLANSKI'S NINTH GATE.  It's hard to believe this wickedly restrained Johnny Depp is the same one who floated through PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.  Depp is an actor with a wide range and an intense desire to play roles one wouldn't originally see him in.  It's hard to tell in the beginning if Depp is a true hero, or is he just as bad as the notorious Frank Langella or the daffy Lena Olin.  Add Emmannuelle Sangier (spelling?) as a guardian angel named Green Eyes and one never really knows what's going on.  Unfortunately, the film is so cerebral it never manages to build any true sense of suspense or terror.  Polanski directs vividly, but with little regard for the emotional input of his characters.  The real star of the movie is the deliciously malevolent musical score.  At times mellow and melancholy, and then buoyant and teasing, it is a true musical score, that adds much to the cinematic goings on.  I did like Barbara Jefford's performance as the Baroness; reminiscent of those great character actresses Estelle Winwood and Joan Plowright.<br />The ending is vague, and the trip may not be worth taking unless you're a true Depp/Polanski fan.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I waited most impatiently and breathlessly for the release of this DVD...and when it finally came, I believe there was a scream loud enough to startle my neighbor as I ran for the TV and settled in for an afternoon of viewing.<br />We pick up right where we left off...with the three warriors running after their friends and fellowship just as strong as when they first set out from Rivendell, the ties of friendship and loyalty and a dedication to good stronger than ties of blood regardless of the fact that the fellowship is strung out over the face of Middle Earth, seperated by time and evil and a pressing need for strengh.<br />I'm thankful that Sam and Frodo's trek to Mordor is presented in such a way as to find the sense of humor in even the darkest of situtations and while the situtation does grow increasingly dangerous and dark, Peter Jackson takes a break from the heaviness surrounding them and their mission and turns that attention toward Rohan and Helm's Deep.  He leaves Sam and Frodo to make their way through the sunny countryside heading toward the firey mountian of Doom and never too far out of mind is the fact that this quest to rid the world of evil could claim their lives.<br />The Battle of Helm's Deep still takes my breath, even away after repeated viewings.  Though they might very well be going to their deaths, the men of Rohan along with a Elven army on loan from Elrond and our three intrepid warriors of the Fellowship take a stand against the beginning of the evil...and the following scene is one that HAD to be made.  Watch it and try not to thank the actors, stunt men, directors and writers for bringing that to the big screen.  Just for the presentation of the will of survival in the name of good it's worth the viewing and the money it took to make it come alive.  Take a seat and watch it for the deeper meanings and you'll be lost in thought for days.
B0000CABBW|5.0|this is one of those magical films that you never want to end.  I cant think of a person who woulnt be touched by this movie.  <BR>A little girl who was shunned growing up because being a first born child, the only survivor of a mother and a set of twins and shes a girl when her family was seeking the son to lead their tribe to salvation.  Very Young Keisha Castle-Hughes starring as the little girl, Pai.  Ive never seen acting quite like this, and certainly not from a child.  If you only see one movie this year, youve gotta make it whale rider.  Its one of those truly inspirational movies that you cant miss.
0385510438|5.0|After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens. But with THE LAST JUROR Grisham comes home to what he knows best: legal literature.<br />THE LAST JUROR tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together, along with help from family to buy The Clanton Times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism. Playing his cards right and reporting on the &quot;dangerous&quot; story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues, the paper is off and running.<br />But, when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead, the people of small town Clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family.<br />Okay, the resolution of the story is predictable but THE LAST JUROR but the writing is vintage Grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that's certainly worth the wait.<br />THE HORSEMAN
B0001ENY6M|4.0|After grinding my teeth through the scourging of Christ, to my emotional break-down during the pounding of nails through his tender hands, I'm proud to own this musical attachment to Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of The Christ&quot;. Some may not be able to stand the richly dramatic music, which could be in connection to the overwhelming contributions and opinions of the lost who have rejected the film, calling it overly violent and anti-Semetic. Truth being, the death of Christ was just that...violent beyond all comparisons. This just happens to be the closest rendition of that holy day. If you see the movie, the music will pull at your soul as you recall the life and death of Christ. Overall, an excellent musical score that leaves an impression like it's associating film.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I remember when this album first came out.

0312995423|5.0|Similar to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons,\\" this book has well-developed characters, an unspeakable conspiracy, an academic hero, a hideous assassin, a mad authoritative figure and the inspiration that makes you want to learn more about the subject matter. The flow of Dan Brown's writing in incredibly engaging and undeniably riveting. It will be hard to put down this book before the very last page is read.<br />The book is not 100% sound from the technical perspective and some might argue that it's not sound from the narrative and logic perspective as well, but it is very informative and thought-provoking. The book tackles the issue of privacy and one's right to have it. Can we afford to live in a world where our most intimate thoughts are read and analyzed? Who has the right to watch us? Who is watching who's watching us? And who is watching who's watching who's watching us?! Pretty interesting premise, huh?<br />Rich with technological, historical and general facts about encryption, NSA, nuclear bombs, privacy battles and languages, this book makes an awesome read. Whether you find computers to be either interesting or repulsive, you will find this reading experience to be quite rewarding.<br />Dan Brown's writing gets better with each book. Since this is his first book, I recommend reading it first and then work your way up from there. You will be glad you did :-)

B0001AP12G|3.0|Let me begin by saying that this CD is hot.  It was much better than I expected it to be.  Kanye West is a phenomenal producer and his rhyme writing skills are evident.  However, he lacks the one element that he needs to go to the next level - and that is presentation.  Kanye can write and produce - but his flow isn't quite there.  Take away the tight beats and I suddenly don't want this CD.  Kanye sounds like a guy who produces and writes - that's trying to rap.  He doesn't sound like a rapper.  Listen to how Jay delivers - or how Eminem delivers before you crown this cat the Messiah.  I think we have been so starved for good hip-hop that we are taking to this CD like a starving man would take to a Ritz cracker.  Doesn't mean the Ritz cracker is good - but it also doesn't mean it's the greatest thing you've ever eaten.  Kanye has the potential to be right there - he just needs to work on his delivery and presentation.  Just my humble opinion.
B000068IEU|5.0|This is basically a film about kidnapping, murder, and revenge. Two teenage girls are on their way to a concert, but they try to buy some dope and end up getting kidnapped by some escaped convicts. The two girls are eventually murdered. Now here's the coincidence, they wind up at the home of one of the girls. The parents discover who they are and take the law into their hands.<br />There are many things that make this movie so much fun that you can't help but to watch over and over again.<br />First we have two bumbling idiot cops. They can't even commandeer a chicken truck from a toothless old black woman. They spend the entire movie walking or running, trying to catch the convicts. They only arrive in time as daddy chops up the gang leader with a chainsaw.<br />Second is the gang-leader's girlfriend. She is a HOTTIE! Oh man for her I would do time, cause she so fine. She's kind of looks like a slutty Pat Benatar with a lot of make-up. Believe me if you like trailer park, alcoholic skanks, she's your idea of heaven.<br />The heroin addict son. This kid's dad is the gang leader. He's the typical loser. You'd swear he didn't even know there was a movie being made. He's so cohereant throughout the entire film. It is awesome when his father finally convinces him to blow his brains out with a gun. And he does it! Wonderful.<br />Every family has a `weird' uncle. This movie portrays him as yet another gang member. He wears bad suits, has bad hair, and looks like a pedophile. He plays the part well, too well. I think the guy was like this in real life.<br />You can tell the two girls in the woods are having a good time at the mercy of their future killers. One girl is told to pee her pants and she does. Then they are forced to get it on with each other. Anyway one tries to make a break for it and is stabbed repeatedly. The other girl is shot. No loss really, they weren't that attractive.<br />The final revenge scenes are awesome. I really want to try the wet carpet plugged into the wall trick. That looked neat. Now when the mom dishes out her revenge on Uncle Charlie, it will make every guy wince and turn away. Look at her face, she's an animal!<br />I highly recommend this film not only as highly acclaimed entertainment, but it would make a great book report.ed into the wall trick. That looked neat.

B0001AP12G|5.0|This LP is off the wall ~ it's original and worthy of listening to. It ain't about guns and quick money but instead West is a fun version of the late great 2Pac as he talks about political issues, the black culture, and his journey to the way up. I just got the cd yesterday and I already got half the songs memorized. Well worth whatever you pay for it.
0312263120|2.0|I loved Dan Brown's other three books, but this was a real disappointment.  I am in 9th grade, and many books stump me.  However, this was too obvious.  I figured out the mystery as soon as any clue was given.  I was quite upset by the simplistic nature of his first book.

0446677450|5.0|The basic theme of the book can be summed up in two words, &quot;buy assets.&quot;  With that as your financial plan your money grows.  Assets are all those things that make money.  Expenses are all those things that cost money.  Your car is not an asset, it's a money pit.  Your house may be an asset or may not.  The rental house you bought, now that's an asset.  Poor people don't know the power of assets, and don't know how to tell an asset from a liability.  It's not a complete forumla for geting rich, but it is the place to start.
0060012218|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author created many memorable, distinct characters, both gay and straight. The main character was so likeable and real it made the book very involving. And the supporting characters also were well drawn.<br />I loved the many twists and turns of the plot. I never knew what was going to happen next, which made this novel almost impossible to put down.<br />This book made me think about love, homosexuality, peer pressure, friendship, and other interesting issues. But it didn't hit me over the head with them. Mostly, it told an exciting story, layered with deeper issues and insights.<br />This is not just a book for gay teens, by the way. I'm a heterosexual middle aged woman and I was completely engrossed by the story and the characters.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I loved the interpretation of New York in the middle of the 19th century with its competing fire gangs, police thugs, corrupt city officials and local neighborhood gangsters.  Although set in the 19th century it represents and describes a lot about New York City and other major cities today.  There are gang wars over turf and drugs, corrupt city officials and police officers who shoot unarmed men 41 times in the back or use toilet plungers for interrogation and intimidation.  Gangs of NY portrays a down side of city life that the regular medial looks the other way at and fawns all over corrupt city officials and their blue uniformed gangs.  That part is worth seeing.  I was disappointed in the level of blood that was depicted, and the deviations from history.  There were draft riots in NYC, but the navy didn't shell the city as depicted.  The meat cleaver scene was around the bend.
B00005JLR8|4.0|This film focuses on Sarah and Johnny Sullivan as they relocate with their two daughters from Ireland through Canada to New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Once in residence in a squalid tenement, they begin a new life together with high hopes and great expectations, although haunted by the death of a toddler. That loss presumably motivated Sarah (Samantha Morton) and Johnny (Paddy Considine) to make a fresh start in a strange city where so many other immigrant families have also done so for more than a century. Johnny is an aspiring actor whose ambitions are endured by his generally sullen wife. It soon becomes obvious that Sarah and (especially) Johnny are ill-prepared for the responsibilities of parenthood. Violent crime as well as alcohol and drug abuse surround the Sullivans where they live and yet the two daughters are often allowed to roam around unsupervised.<br />Over time, the Sullivans become friends with Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), a neighbor in the tenement who eventually provides unexpected assistance when it is needed most. (The nature of that assistance is best revealed in the film.) Frankly, I still do not know what to make of the relationship between Mateo and the Sullivans. The friendship they share was more a distraction than a revelation as I struggled to understand Sheridan's purposes. Unlike Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, for example, Mateo seems a contrivance.<br />Having seen four films which Sheridan previously directed -- My Left Foot (1989), The Field (1990), In the Name of the Father (1993), and The Boxer (1997) -- I admire so much what he has contributed to our understanding of the courage and determination which many of his characters somehow summon in response to severe hardship. They evince an integrity lacking in the adult characters in this film, with the possible exception of Mateo. As indicated, there are several reasons for my disappointment in In America. Nonetheless, the performances by Hounsou and the Bolger sisters almost -- not quite -- elevate this film above the inadequacies of its  narrative (i.e. gritty realities awkwardly juxtaposed with fantasy) as well as the disturbing questions raised about the Sullivans as parents.- not quite -- elevate this film above the inadequacies of its  narrative (i.e. gritty realities awkwardly juxtaposed with fantasy) as well as the disturbing questions raised about the Sullivans as parents.
0767817486|5.0|This is one of the best prison films alongside &quot;Papillion,&quot;  &quot;Death and the Maiden,&quot; and &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman.&quot;<br />It's purpose is to juxtapose foolish freedom with insane ancient cultures. The result is tragic, terrifying, and almost beyond comprehension in it's cruelty. And if you don't believe  prison life in Muslim countries isn't still like this, you must be crazy! (Read &quot;Not Without My Daughter;&quot; the film doesn't even begin to touch on the horrors she survived in Iran).<br />One cool note: you can see the REAL Billy Hayes acting in a play about prison life filmed at San Quentin!!  It's called, &quot;The Cage&quot; and  it's only available on half(dot)com. Hard to believe that he'd want to recreate the &quot;sadism of prison guards and the inmates' frenzied cruelty to each other&quot; (Variety) only 15 years after escaping the Turkish prison!

White develops judgement to go with his muscle, Exley goes from squeaky clean, don't get your hands dirty to &quot;Shotgun Ed&quot;, and Hollywood Jack Vincennes eventually discovers a sense of drive to solve an outstanding case. In the end, Exley gets a promotion, White gets &quot;an ex-hooker and a trip to Arizona&quot;.  For Bud White, I'm sure thats good enough.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I am an Elton FANATIC!!! So naturally I bought this collection even though I had all of these songs on at least two albums.  Everyone will agree Elton's earlier stuff was his best.  The '80's produced few memorable songs and the '90's were well mediocre. The Lion King although good can not compare to &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; or &quot;Burn Down the Mission.&quot; These two songs should have gone on this collection as should have &quot;Harmony&quot; &quot;Take Me to the Pilot&quot; and &quot;Hercules.&quot; Elton will always be a phenominal piano player but his songwriting skills have deteriorated a little bit through out the years.

B0000AZKLF|5.0|Something happened in December 1983 in CHCH studies in Hamilton, Ontario.<br />Blues Guitar at it's best: Powerful yet restrained, deep, potent, progressing with the session.  Maybe even blues, therefore guitar, at it's best, although some may quibble with that.<br />At times, Stevie holds back, perhaps out of respect, perhaps out of humility.  However, this is not weak playing; it's the most powerful kind, because it is at the edge of explosion and control, held under check with virtuosity. Albert's playing is the kind that only decades in the company of the blues can create.<br />Together, it is more than the sum of its parts.<br />The CD is an interesting compilation of dialogue and music, with operatic power.  Some of the dialog fades into the music, first covertly and overtly, and then remerges as the playing continues, sometimes in vocals and sometimes in strumming.  Distant respect and acknowledgement becomes palpable, immediate respect, both for each other.<br />They never played together again.  This was the one and only time.  They are both gone now; Stevie Ray Vaughan died in 1990, Albert King in 1992.

0553579908|3.0|This is a great story with very interesting characters and a plot like no other fantasy novel I've read, but this is no masterpiece.<br />How the story is being told will literally build you up to a climax and then just leave you there for a few chapters while it discusses some other characters.  Sometimes these other characters add to the main plot but all too often you will find yourself wondering if they really added anything to the story or if they just tripped up the tempo.  Since the chapters are dealing with different characters I often found myself half heartedly skimming through some of the chapters that are not actually affecting the outcome of the central plot<br />I'm also confused why Robb gets so few (if any, not going to check now)chapters even Davos and Danerys (however you spell it) get more and their chapters could be omitted from the book with no great loss to the story.<br />The story is great though and will drag you through the slow parts and it is definitely not your standard plotline.  If it wasn't for the unnecessary chapters interfering with the main plot this book would definitely rate higher.
0060194995|5.0|I'd be surprised to hear of any American who hasn't opened the pages of this classic Harper Lee novel.  Yes, we have Boo Radley, Atticus, Jem, Scout, and many more characters, but the truth behind this novel is sometimes doing what's right isn't about doing what's easy.<br />This is a lesson we should all take to heart again and again.<br />I have read this book again and again throughout my life.  I shall continue to re-read it to my children and hope the cycle will continue.
B00008EY9G|2.0|A tip to filmmakers for future reference: don't pull wool over the audience's eyes unless you've got something really good to show them when you pull it off again. Identity tries its best: it jumps through all the familiar slasher genre hoops (rainswept motel, escaped murderer, mismatched bunch of strangers dropping like flies the minute they're left alone) before attempting a multiple backflip-into-somersault manouevre two thirds of the way in. &quot;Mulholland Drive, Mulholland Drive,&quot; it whispers to itself as a confidence-booster, only to lose its footing, stumble wildly and fall flat. On. Its. Face.<BR>The problem is that Identity isn't nearly as smart as it so desperately wants to be - its ace card is certainly unexpected, but it's a plot volte face that adds nothing to the proceedings beyond turning them on their head. It's not particularly clever, either - certainly not enough to redeem the rest of the movie (which is, for the record, watchable without being in the slightest bit memorable). Had the makers of Identity given the psychological wig-out aspect of their movie a little more thought, they might have ended-up with a minor classic on their hands. Had they made the slasher element a bit less predictable, they could have gotten away with eschewing the hallowed twist altogether. As it is, they've left us with a depressing hotch-potch, a whole that's nothing more than the sum of its parts.
B00005JLXE|4.0|It was in the 70's that I read my first Daredevil comics. I obtained two back to back issues and was struck immediately by the unusual dark art that created a very different world than most other comics. I believe it was drawn by Gene Colan who also provided the art for Marvel's Dracula. <BR>I was also struck by Daredevil's personal life. Heather was Daredevil's girlfriend, but he was also crazy about a red haired spy/super-heroine named Blackwidow. Reading Daredevil at the age of 9 was very exciting. It was really fun because it was something different, dark and unusual. The passion between Blackwidow and Daredevil drove her boyfriend Hercules (yes THAT Hercules!) crazy and had Captain America and the Beast whispering gossip in a corner!<BR>Daredevil was hospital bound at the time and that was a very different twist too from most super-heroes. He still wore his mask in the hospital, but he had the top of it cut away and the top of his head was bandaged and he was hooked to an I.V. and wearing a hospital gown! He was also tormented by nightmares involving his father. That's all that I recall about those issues, but the idea that Daredevil was something different from the typical super-hero stuck with me over the years. <BR>25 years later that still remains true. All the things that I remember from those comics 25 years ago are in the Daredevil film. Some love it and some hate it, but to me it's definitely Daredevil. The movie lives up to my expectations. Sure the action is far fetched and the bad guys are silly, especially Bullseye, but it's a comic book.
B00005JLXE|4.0|There are those who gripe that Daredevil isn't realistic. So? <BR>There are those who complain that it's not suitable for pre-teens. The box says it's rated PG-13 folks. <BR>Some compare Daredevil to other super-hero movies and sound like little girls on the play-ground battling over how Power Puff Girls is better than Kim Possible. What's next a tirade about how Clash of the Titans bastardizes Greek mythology and rips off Star Wars? Duh.<BR>I think this is a very entertaining DVD set. Nothing more and nothing less.
0790729628|5.0|In the summer of '82, this excellent movie kept drawing me back to the theater as a college student -- alone, being single.  For the sake of comparison, that summer I went to see E.T. -- just once.<br />11 years later, I went to see the director's cut version -- as a married man, with my wife.  That night I noticed some of the audience expressed their recollection of the lines from the characters.  Then it dawned on me that this movie had become a cult classic, and I had actually become a member unknowingly many years back.<br />The details were rich.  The design was first-rated.  Doesn't the latest Toyota Prius (a hybrid) look a bit like Deckard's vehicle?<br />The film was based on Philip K. Dick's science fiction novel, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheeps?\\" -- also a classic.<br />This movie received some negative reviews by the critics at the time -- understandably.  First, the film was summer release, but virtually the entire story took place at night while it was raining outside.  Secondly, if the movie had Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly in it, the critics might take the film more seriously (not to take credit away from the actual cast).  Lastly, the light, the smoke, and the details could be quite distracting to the storyline, in which the audience needed to deal with the concept of \\"replicant\\" at an emotional level.
0385510438|3.0|I'm a huge fan of John Grisham and have read all but one of his books.  That said, I don't think that The Last Juror was as bad as some of the other customer reviewers have made it out to be.  I was actually quite excited at the prospect of another of Grisham's stories set in Clanton, Mississippi, the same town in which the best book he's ever written-A Time to Kill-is set.<br />In The Last Juror, Grisham has done his usual fine job in developing interesting, colorful characters and in describing the town and its environs.  It's very evident that he's familiar with the local color and has done a good job of capturing the look and feel of a small southern town from the early 70s struggling with with everything from racial prejudice and desegregation to corruption to the blight created when a national superstore chain comes to town.  I also found the plot to be very interesting albeit somewhat derivative: a member of a very powerful but reclusive family is tried for and convicted of the rape and murder of a young widow.   In prison, he receives preferential treatment and gains early parole.  Shortly after his release some members of the jury that convicted him are killed.  The story is told from the point of view of a college dropout who owns and operates the town's weekly newspaper.  Parenthetically, I understand that Grisham did not want to title the book as it was but caved in to pressure from his publisher.  After reading the book, I now uderstand why-the title is somewhat of a misnomer.  There is no LAST juror, so just put this issue aside and enjoy the book.<br />Other reviewers have criticized Grisham's writing in this book and I must concede that on some level they're right.  The book is divided into three sections, the first of which is as well written as any of Grisham's earlier work.  The writing in the second and third parts, however, seem to suggest that Grisham started losing interest in his subject and was just going through the motions.  I can't remember any Grisham novel in recent memory that contained so many short chapters.  That's too bad, because this book really started out with some promise.  After the first few chapters I was raving to my wife that this might be Grisham's best book yet but by the end I realized it was not to be.<br />Overall, I'd rate the Last Juror as a much better novel than some of his more recent efforts like the Testament and The King of Torts, but not quite as good as The Summons or A Time to Kill.  While I that Grisham revisits Clanton in subsequent books, I also hope that he puts a little more effort into those visits.  But then again, maybe my expectations were too high.
B00009L1TA|2.0|Before watching the movie, check out the \\"Extras\\" where no one involved in the movie can even agree with what the movie is about. They can't even agree what \\"genre\\" the movie is.<BR>Basically the movie meanders on with EVERY character lying for the whole length of the movie - is Sam dead, alive, good, bad? Who done it or DIDN'T do it? Why? <BR>The REAL question should be why was this junk even made? Why did Travolta & Jackson even bother. The movie provides Travolta with his worst role since Vinny Barbarino and Jackson his worst role since appearing regularly on the Pee Wee Herman Playhouse with Geri curls.

B0001HAISG|5.0|What an amazing film! There's so many interesting, prevalent, and psychological themes/ideas to digest after watching this. It is NOT simply a \\"kid's flick.\\" In fact, I would argue that adults (or those who are on the cusp of adulthood) may find this more interesting than young children. <BR>It really is a beautiful film to watch. The way it was shot and the colors used are absolutely breathtaking, and the score is one of the best I have ever heard. The acting is brilliant, the characters are perfectly cast and all have incredible meaning behind them. The story is a classic and is presented here the best that it has ever been presented. There are so many layers and levels to the story if you analyze it carefully. It's kept me thinking for months now (I saw it Dec. 26th)<BR>The DVD is bound to be great, despite the rather childish cover photo/collage thing, and 18.98$ is such a small price to pay to own this masterpiece forever! (whoa, I just sounded way too much like an advertiser)<br />Seriously, what more could you ask for in a movie?
B00008H2LE|5.0|This cd is worth it, still not the best Linkin Park cd its still a great cd, I would recomend this to anyone.<BR>But I just love the songs Breaking the Habit and Nobody's Listening, Breaking the Habit i play over and over and over and still i'm not tired of it, and I think is the best song they wrote so far. Nobodys Listening another favorite I just love rapping to it, and another great song written by Linkin Park!!!!!!!
B0001HAISG|5.0|Okay, I am going to say it: This trumps even the Disney version. THERE!<br />This is by far the best visual interpretation of the story I have yet seen. For many reasons. First off, Peter Pan is FINALLY being played by an actual boy! YIPPEEE!!<br />The first real exposure I had to this story was at the tender age of 7, when, while skimming through a Disney cartoon coloring book, I came across a drawing of Wendy attempting to give Peter a kiss. How deliciously scandalous! I was instantly intrigued, and after reading the book and seeing the movie, I soon realized, even at such an innocent age, that this was not your ordinary fairy tale. Indeed, for all the talk about children staying young forever, this story sure does touch heavily upon many grown-up situations. I have often insisted that the story of Peter Pan is NOT for kids! (But perhaps they realize this too, and that is why they have been entranced by it for almost a century....It's as close to adult material as their parents will allow!)<br />Thank you thank you THANK YOU, Mr. Hogan, for seeing this as well and not being afraid to tackle it. I understand that child labor laws have long kept boys from playing the title role, but I'd be willing to bet that there was/is also an underlying desire to suppress the sensual themes explored in the original story by having the safety of a female playing Pan. As Roger Ebert so aptly put it, \\"The sensuality is there, and the other versions have pretended it was not.\\" (I agree, although the Disney version walked that fine line very delicately, what with the playing up of Peter's \\"rock star\\" appeal to basically every female he came across, including the mermaids and Tiger Lily....the latter, in this film version, becoming a belle for John instead.)<br />Another intertesting choice in this film was the decision to make Captain Hook almost sympathetic and also rather attractive in that oh-so forbidden way (which is subtley hinted at in the book). It was an effective choice though, as we are able to fully understand Wendy's moral dilemma when she is faced with the decision of staying underground with the emotionally detatched Peter or to become a pirate alongside the fascinating Hook, whom she describes as \\"a man of feelings.\\" No longer is the pirate captain just a dark figure with an iron claw lurking about to seek some simple revenge. Now, he actually has LAYERS! Whoddathunkit?!?!<br />To all the critics out there who have flown into such a tizzy about this movie being so \\"overtly sexual,\\" alls I hafta to say is Please seek a therapist, because you obviously have some unresolved Freudian issues that you are taking out on this film. This is 2004, not 1904.<br />The only place where I felt this film could improve was in the character (or lack thereof really) of Tinkerbell. Unlike the stage and cartoon versions, she is given little exploration and is basically a pint-sized \\"deus ex machina,\\" swooping into the storyline whenever it needs a crucial plot point. (Indeed, this is rather how she was portrayed in the book also....perhaps Hogan was just sticking to the original story here.)<br />But on the whole, I would have to rate this film just a hair under Perfect. Every character was portrayed suberbly...there was not a weak player in the bunch. The effects were a bit cheesey, but fortunately the filmmakers did not soley rely on them for the entertainment value. There were so many golden moments in this movie it is hard to pinpoint just which one is my favorite. The whole hour and 45 minutes is just an absolute treasure. :-)
B00018D44U|4.0|I don't have the &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; album, so there's no way I could compare the two.<br />Nonetheless &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is an instant favorite.  <br />I know there are some who won't consider Norah Jones a jazz singer, and that's alright with me.  To me it's always the music that counts, regardless of the genre.<br />&quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is simple and rich, soft and sweet.  I'd listened to the entire four time since I bought it yesterday.<br />My most favorite tracks are (so far)<BR>SUNRISE; THOSE SWEET WORDS; THE LONG WAY HOME; THE PRETTIEST THING; TOES.<br />It's definitely not easy to make an album like this, without the big powerful guitars, booming bass, thundering drums and all those studio gizmos, you really need a lot of talent, hardwork and heart to pull it off.<br />And these days, good, let alone great, music is hard to come by.  I'm happy to have stumnbled on this one.
B00006JOPY|4.0|Of the three first Dio solo records, all of which included guitar god Vivian Campbell, 'Sacred Heart' (1985) is one of the most overlooked of Dio's catalogue.  &quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot; is even better than the openers on the other records, the epic title track is good (but better done as a live version on 'Intermission' (1986) and the newest 'Anthology), the single &quot;Rock and Roll Children&quot; is very medodic, and the most-underrated album cut of all time, &quot;Like the Beat of a Heart&quot;, has got a HEAVY groove.<br />As with 'Holy Diver' (1983) and 'The Last In Line' (1984), the record REALLY benefits from a remastering, especially on the bottom end.  My only complaint is that, for this much money, they should include the b-sides associated with the record (e.g., &quot;Hide in the Rainbow&quot; from the Iron Eagle soundtrack, &quot;Like the Beat of a Heart&quot; [Live], and &quot;Hungry for Heaven&quot; [Live]).
B00006JMTR|2.0|Movie is horrible but horses are FABULOUS!  This is some of the best footage of the fabled Andalusian Horses I've ever seen - if there's more out there somebody please let me know!  Bought the movie just to see the horses.
B00006JOPZ|4.0|Of all of the Dio solo records originally released in the 1980s, I have to say that 'Dream Evil' (1987), the debut of guitarist Craig Goldy, sounds the least dated.  Although I remember the sound of the original CD being quite flat, this remaster is a real improvement.<br />On this CD, Dio went for more of a &quot;secular&quot; approach, abandoning much of the doom-and-gloom and D&amp;D metaphors to display a more mature sense of lyric writing.  I especially like &quot;Naked in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Overlove&quot;, the former of which could have easily been a single and the latter of which inlcudes a highpoint guitar-wise.  Other highlights include &quot;Night People&quot;, &quot;Sunset Superman&quot;, and &quot;When a Woman Cries&quot;.  The chosen singles/promos, &quot;All the Fools Sailed Away&quot; and &quot;I Could Have Been a Dreamer&quot;, were a bit overrought - a choice that surely hurt the record's broad-based appeal.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Right from 1970 onward, George Harrison has always made his albums with great songcraft and care. This box, while not perfect, delivers on many different levels and should be in the music library of all George Harrison fans as well as more-casual Beatles fans.<BR>The DVD and book it is housed in are simply magnificent. How great is it to see footage of George live in Japan in 1991 with Eric Clapton! Seeing him play a stinging slide on tracks such as &quot;Cheer Down&quot; and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; remind of his unbelievable talent.<BR>(If only he had toured more than he did. But that's another story.)<BR>The book is crafted, again with care, with beautiful and rare photographs and an interesting collage of news clippings from the era of 1974, when he launched Dark Horse Records. The notes by Rolling Stone's David Fricke help complete the package.<BR>Of course, it is mostly about the music. The six albums are all wonderfully remastered, with CD booklets containing awesome rarely seen photos. Much more complete than the original CD reissues of the early 1990s.<BR>Music-wise, the clean sound helps really bring home the sheer brilliance and multi-layered ear candy that are &quot;This Song,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Girl,&quot; &quot;It's What You Value&quot; from 1976's 33 1/3; &quot;Love Comes to Everyone,&quot; &quot;Blow Away&quot; and &quot;If You Believe,&quot; from 1979's self-titled album; &quot;Mystical One&quot; and &quot;Unknown Delight&quot; from the highly underrated Gone Troppo. There isn't enough time to go into the gems on 1987's Cloud Nine, or to run down the career-spanning gems delivered live with Eric Clapton on the Live in Japan SACD (Don't worry, it also plays on a standard CD player).<BR>A slight negative is the lack and variety of bonus tracks: Almost all George Harrison fans know about the travesty of Somewhere in England, and the four rejected songs. One of those, strangely enough, is a bonus track on the excellent 33 1/3. But the other three are nowhere to be found. CAPITOL, PLEASE REMEMBER SONGS SUCH AS &quot;Flying Hour,&quot; &quot;Lay His Head&quot; and &quot;Sat Singing&quot; ON ANY FUTURE ANTHOLOGY (WHICH HAS BEEN LONG-RUMORED)... Too bad &quot;Cheer Down&quot; didn't make it either. But at least there IS the Live in Japan version!<BR>The olive green box with the distinctive top-opening lid is so beautiful, too. The 1974 photo of George, amid the leaves of God's nature which he adored, and the stunning Dark Horse logo really are awe-inspiring for Harrison fans and should open the eyes, and ears, of many other music fans who have always been reluctant to give the &quot;Quiet Beatle&quot; his due as a solo act. <BR>The timing of this release also is great, following the acclaimed &quot;Brainwashed&quot; and &quot;Concert for George&quot; DVD (both highly recommended) and his Grammy for the pop instrumental &quot;Marwa Blues.&quot; His induction in March into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a soloist can only help shine the light of awareness on even more people! To that, I can only say, &quot;It's about time!&quot; God Bless You George, Olivia and Dhani for this wonderful treasure that I will always cherish!!!

0061015725|2.0|I have to admit that for the first 100 pages I could not put this book down. It was intriguing, well researched and written, fast paced, and I was hooked. Then, when the action moved to the lab in the Arizona desert, I suddenly lost all interest. The reason? the dialogue of the young team at the lab was absolutely insipid, with the F word liberally sprinkled in every other sentence. I was really disappointed. The story lost its pace, got mired in the painfully banal bickering of a team of people no one cares about, and a potentially great story came to an end. I wasn't willing to wade through the muck to find out what happened. <BR>This brings me to a question. Why does Chichton feel he needs to depict young characters - scientists in this case - as nasty, foul mouthed and arrogant? Why does he need to resort to using filthy language? Does he think this will make his books appear more &quot;hip&quot; to younger readers? Maybe he's desperate to widen his audience and thinks he can do so by dumbing his writing down to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The only thing I'm sure of is that he reduced his audience by at least one with this book. That it is a number 1 New York Times bestseller is a very sad reflection on all of us.

B0000VCZK2|4.0|...if I had it to do all over again, I believe I would have bought the movies one 2-disc set at a time rather than all at once in this box set.<br />Buying the box set is a bit easier on the bank account, and there is a bonus 9th DVD that can't be had any other way...but the 9th disc is more of an appendix and even the most hardcore &quot;Alien&quot; fan probably won't watch it more than once.<br />The problem I have with the box set isn't its content; the alternative versions of each movie alone make this latest reissue absolutely necessary...and as each episode in the series has an entire separate DVD's worth of bonus features, a viewer can literally spend an entire weekend watching a single movie.<br />However, the box set's composition is a serious let-down.  Its design means that it must be ceremoniously unfolded each time a disc is viewed.  This puts extra wear on the package, contributing to an early disintegration.  The rubber-based glue used to secure the plastic disc fasteners to the cardboard packaging is also of inferior grade; even the slightest temperature fluctuations cause the glue to lose its cohesive qualities.  The end result is that that the whole thing falls apart.  I'd expect a lot better from Fox, especially considering the fanbase for this franchise.<br />To make a long rant short, buy these reissues.  Even the ones for the chapters you might not have cared for previously; I promise you that they've all been done to the nines and are absolutely worth spending the time seeing again (sometimes as though for the first time).  But steer clear of the box set; Fox has given us a shoddy product in this guise and they must be held accountable by the fans of the series.

B0001906O0|5.0|A few years ago I was saying how much I missed the familiar guitars, beats, and sounds -- and hearing them in new ways. Granted, after Disintegration I wandered away from the Cure, thinking they had finally sold out (Bloodflowers delightedly proved me wrong). For anyone who has memorized (almost) all Cure songs available to the human ear (in one form or another), you have got to get this. It's a blissful revisiting of the past, and a deft mix for the future.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Being a DT fan since the first time I heard Pull Me Under 11 or 12 years ago (man how the time flies!) I impatiently awaited the release of this album. It was well worth the wait. The most consistly heavy that DT has ever played. This was definitely a step in a different direction for them but they are so immensely talented they can pretty much play any style and still be original and sound great. <br />I particularly enjoyed &quot;AS I AM&quot; and &quot;HONOR THY FATHER&quot; but all the songs were great. <br />For those who have never heard of DT (It's real shame they don't get more credit and notariety that they rightfully deserve. I guess a group that can actually write songs and play its instuments are not in demand these days with the garbage that passes as music) I would highly recommend giving them a listen.
B0001AP12G|5.0|When I first listened to the album I didnt recognize the true talent that Kanye West had. Speakerboxxx/Love Below was a great vacation from normal hip hop but Kanye West has managed to help to bring Hip Hop back into the music scene. His gift with old tracks and samples helps him to create instant hits. With perhaps maybe too many skits (about 4) in the album, the flow is slowed down (as we can instantly see that Kanye West is not a lover of College.<br />Rating of Songs:<br />Intro- Little Scene with Cedric the Entertainer, FUNNY, great start<br />We Don't Dare- Addictive Beat, nice background vocals. Solid Start tothe album 4/5 stars<br />All Falls Down- Destined to be a radio hit, great background vocals 5/5<br />I'll Fly Away- Short song with gospel influences 3/5<br />Jesus Walks- Good track, thought provoking lyrics 4/5<br />Never Let me Down- Jay-Z comes out to help his superstar producer, result is solid hit also 5/5<br />Get em High - One of the less themed songs of the album; catchy though 4/5<br />Workout Plan- EXTREMELY FUNNY! Great intro to &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; 5/5<br />School Spirit- An ok track. Not one of my favorites but still enjoyable 3.5/5<br />The New Workout Plan- I HOPE he makes this one a video. Destined to be remembered 5/5<br />Spaceship- The BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. My favorite with smooth beats, interesting lyrics and just extremely done well 10/5!!!!<br />Family Business- A softer side of Kanye 4/5<br />Definitely cop this CD, never a waste of money
B00005JN02|5.0|Oh my goodness!  This was such a great movie!  I loved it!  I watched it in my German culture class while I was studying abroad at the University of Regensburg, Germany, and thought it was a great film!  It was a very interesting insight into the lives of the people who lived in East Germany and their customs.  For me personally, it was also an eye opener and dispelled some of the stereotypes I had formed in my mind of the DDR.  On top of that, it was just a funny movie (it is intended, from what I understand, to be a comedy, so I didn't feel bad about laughing).  It's also just a great story about the love one son had for his mother (in what many Americans would consider a very twisted way...maybe many Germans too).  I'm so excited that this movie is coming to the US, and can't wait for it to be released on DVD...I don't have a DVD player that plays region 2, so I'm stuck waiting for it to come out here!  LOL  I have only one simple warning:  this is not what I would call the \\"best\\" movie for a beginning German student to watch, as the language is very difficult to understand.  I had been studying German for over 6 years when I first saw this movie, and it was still very difficult for me to understand.  However, it's still a great story.  Well, I hope this was helpful, and I hope you all enjoy this movie.;)
B00005B36H|2.0|Wow, what a tiresome 80 minutes that was. Tool have gone for an ambient approach on Lateralus. Stretch out about 3 minutes worth of music into about 9 or 10 minutes of tedium. None of these songs have any hooks nor do they have any mind blowing instrumentation. They are just................long...............and...bland. It's like they are just jamming in slow motion. Hit a tom there, strum a chord here, pluck a couple of bass notes. Maynard asks \\"Have we reached 10 minutes yet?\\" ...Adam Jones looks at his watch. Maynard sounds like he recorded the vocals in about 15 minutes in between touring with A Perfect Circle. Ok, maybe i'm being a bit harsh, Tool are still alot better than most mainstream music but this album was so uninspiring. \\"Parabola\\" is the only song that redeems this boring pretentious affair.
B0001ENY6M|3.0|I have to say I let the cinema feeling numb after this movie.  Not because it was good,but because it was needlessly violent; self indulgent and the most uninspiring movie about The Passion ever made.  That said the soundtrack, is a subtle as the movie.  In the movie it was overbearing, on CD is good listen, but I expected something more haunting, sad and beautiful, much like my expectations for the film.  That said it is a fair anough soundtrack.
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace is like that perfect yet surreal record that when you listen to it, you say to yourself \\"This is what music should sound like\\". It's the kind of album no other artist would dare try and make, because they know they would fail miserably and look stupid. \\"Grace\\" has 7 original cuts and 3 carefully selected covers. Every track is intricately layered with amazing detail down to the very last note. While many have covered \\"Hallelujah\\" before, Jeff's version will completely flaw you. You will not hear a better version of that song in your life, and anyone who says they have is lying. Jeff's powerful angelic vocals along with the music just flow together in perfect harmony. Many have tried to copy Jeffs style over the years but none have come close to being as transcendently beautiful as Jeff Buckley.
0783225849|5.0|I can't believe I just bought this movie yesterday.  It's a classic, and I've been missing out!<BR>One of the more creepy Hitchock films I'd say.  <BR>If you are at all a Hitchcock fan - then this obviously is a must own movie for you.  There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this classic!
0312263120|3.0|This is a nice weekend mystery book. It touches upon interesting themes: (1) mysteries of the NSA; (2) supercomputers; (3) cryptography. Since those themes, are somewhat more &quot;specialized&quot; than the ones used by Dan Brown in &quot;the Code&quot; or in &quot;Angels and demons&quot; the book may not appeal to the same audience.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'm not at ALL a Britney Spears fan.  The only reason I bought it was because she worked with Madonna...however, I was suprised to hear some pretty dang great songs.  'Toxic' and 'Breath' are the best...so even non-Britney fans should check it out.<br />One thing I will say though - is just because this album is good, it is not going to make me go buy her previous releases...
0385504209|4.0|This an excellent mystery book, combined with a dose of controversial historical perspectives, including confluence of ideas related to biblical themes (Jesus and Mary Magdalene); the Crusades (the Grail and the knights Templar); and conspiracy theories (masons; world domination, etc.).<br />In my opinion, this book is best suited either for: (1) those interested in the topics enumerated above; or (2) by those looking for an engaging mystery book.<br />I found that I knew many of themes and theories in the book, and therefore the real was not as surprising as it is apparently for others.
B00008VGK0|5.0|The single 'American Life'.  Only because Madonna voiced her opinion on being anti-war, this gem got over looked, and brush aside by radio &amp; video stations.  It's a shame, because it's a great song!<br />The remixes on this maxi-single are awesome.  Peter Rauhofer has that special way of really beefing up a great song and making it even better.<BR>Although I'm not a huge fan of the Missy Elliott remix, I'm glad it's on here - it brings the maxi full circle, with a large variety of sounds.<br />For anyone who doesn't buy American Life just because people say it sucks, or it was a flop and Madonna should give it up - that's too bad - because it's by far some of her BEST work.  So check it out!
0385507755|5.0|I'm a voracious reader (my average is about one book every two to three days).  With all those words in my head, a lot of what I have read in the past becomes hazy after a while.  This book, however, has stuck in my head for some time now--enough so that I felt compelled to come back to Amazon and write this review.<br />This is James Frey's true and personal story of the time he spent in rehab in Minnesota for an extremely severe case of alcoholism and drug addiction.  He doesn't glamorize anything, he doesn't whine about anything.  I was shocked to read how hostile other reviewers have been toward Frey, and find it interesting that they never criticize the quality of the writing or engrossing nature of the tale--their only problem is that Frey came from a privileged family and had help, while they did not.<br />At any rate, unlike what others here claim, Frey doesn't cry his way through this book.  On the contrary, it was the extremely matter-of-fact style of writing that I found most interesting.  Frey's troubles, offenses, and struggles are reported in this book as facts.  He never seems to feel sorry for himself (indeed, the entire basis of his recovery is &quot;I did this to myself, and I can undo it for myself&quot;), but does show sympathy for a number of other individuals in rehab.  The stories of those others are also presented, giving a more comprehensive view of the diverse group of people one can expect to find in a rehabilitation facility.  He does, perhaps, focus slightly too much on his renegade style for recovery, but that is clearly something about which he feels very strongly.<br />I recommend this book to everyone, everywhere.  It was one of the few things I have read recently that both entertained and informed simultaneously.
159228115X|5.0|The Long Walk, a tale of the heroic, single-minded mission of a band of desperate prisoners to escape the shackles of their Soviet jailers, is enough to inspire even the most jaded reader to pity and amazement at their tribulations. You must excuse the frequent lack of prose skill, as it imparts more of the passion of the narrator, a young Polish officer captured by forces whom he didn't fully realise were the enemy until too late. The sober tone and harrowing events prevent this narrative from sliding into a \\"Great Escape\\" style of hijinks and helps to keep the reader focused on the internal struggles these men (and woman) faced as much as the physical trials.<br />The scale of their exploits is quite staggering. Just the idea of traversing the Siberian Taiga, the Gobi Desert and the jagged teeth of the Himalaya is near unbelievable even in today's much more amenable conditions, but to do it in wartime, with little or no equipment, inadequate clothing, food or water? My friend and I read this together while in the midst of a 200 mile hike and just the thought of their suffering seemed to alleviate any of our own aches and pains.<br />This book was named by National Geographic Adventure as one of it's 100 all-time great adventure novels, in a pantheon of stars including Wilfred Thesiger, Paul Theroux, Apsley Cherry-Garrard, Jon Krakauer and Antoine de-Sainte Exupery. Having read a great many of the novels on that list I concur wholeheartedly with the NGS. Forget the fractured English, soak in the seething hatred of the communists and breathe the air of freedom in truly inspiring company.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card pens in the introduction to Ender's Game that the story came to him many years before its writing. The premise of the story is a similar premise to most strong science fiction: A military and political base, which is built upon by differentiating the fiction's situation from the real-world situation. While Card articulates a world decidedly different than the one we currently inhabit, he is strikingly able to convey a sense of &quot;currency.&quot; Card hardly alienates his readers by the changes of society, he instead pulls them even closer. The development of characters throughout this book is excellent, and they are represented as complex, warring beings - both within themselves and with others.<br />Ender Wiggin is a child genius, a &quot;third&quot; in a world which only accepts two children. He, like other children like him, are trained in military strategy in order to assist the Earth's efforts in fighting an alien race, the Buggers. While many of the names for beings in this book are reminiscent of elementary school science fiction, the ideas behind them overshadow any predisposition a poor name may provide.<br />Ender undergoes a grueling military sequence, beginning at battle school and eventually winding up at what he believes to be a commander training school. When he goes to Battle School at the age of six years old (an age which still strikes me as far, far too young, regardless of Card's premise), he leaves behind his brother, Peter, his sister, Valentine, and his two parents.<br />The relationships between the characters seethe with humanity: They are complex, with depth and inner-conflict. Ender's sister, Valentine, is torn between supporting Ender in his battles, and letting her own emotions interfere. Ender hates Peter, because he identifies too strongly with him - and this disturbs Ender.<br />Card employs a simplistic writing style, making it easy to read. However, this doesn't not indicate a poor story line - rather, the simplicity helps to draw the reader in by letting them focus upon the story, rather than complex syntax and interpretation.<br />Overall, this book represents science fiction's strongest traits: It is a portrait of humanity painted so differently than we see, but we recognize ourselves in it. This was truly a book which stayed with me long after reading it.icity helps to draw the reader in by letting them focus upon the story, rather than complex syntax and interpretation. <br />Overall, this book represents science fiction's strongest traits: It is a portrait of humanity painted so differently than we see, but we recognize ourselves in it.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Rather than trying to argue with the people who don't like the movie (as everyone else seems to be doing), I figured I would actually review the DVD. <br />First of all, the movie is remarkably well done considering the pure scale of the books. To try and recreate Tolkein's world is an enormous task, and was incredibly well done by Peter Jackson. LOTR is incredibly simple in its plot, but its the way the characters who are not human become human to us and make us relate to them that makes LOTR interesting. Its a human interest story when it really comes down to it. <br />As for the extended edition DVD, I just have to say wow. There's a lot of information to take in. But when you spend 3 years filming a movie and then another 3 editing it, you might as well do it right. I'm a huge fan of documentaries of any kind, from the Civil War to the history of hot dogs, I find it fascinating. If you're not that type of person, the normal dvd will probably suit you just fine, but if you either are an absolubte fanatic about LOTR or just really enjoy behind the scenes of things in general, then its an incredibly well put together dvd. <br />The extra scenes that were added into the movie aren't especially neccesary if you're just a casual fan, since it makes the movie that much longer (about 50 minutes), but if you have the patience to sit through it and really enjoy the films, then the extra scenes are very nice to have. A lot of humorous scenes and character background scenes got cut out of the theatrical version, so it kinda makes the movie a little less gloomy. <br />So to sum up, wonderful film, surprisingly extraordinary cast, and extended scenes and the most comprehensive extra features a dvd release has ever seen make this a wonderful dvd for your collection and very much worth the extra $10 over the theatrical version.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Im not gonna lie.  I was one of the peeps who thought the beats would be fire on this album, but the rhymes would be soft.  Well I was half right, cause the beatz is hot, but the rhymes is even hotta.  Kanye is a soulful dude and for a rookie album, he about to DMX the game
B00006690G|5.0|I SERIOUSLY dislike rap.  I can't think of a song in the past 10 years that I've liked that was rap.  But Eminem does it.  I am a bread and butter rock kind of guy.  But &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot; has some of the purest emotion in ANY song I've heard in a while.  A friend of mine (knowing my tastes) forced me to listen to Eminem and have been unable to thank him since.  I'm reluctant to say it, but Eminem has some genuine talent.  As for the album, the rest of the songs stand on equal ground with &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot; (if you've heard it, you know what I mean.)  This is a good album.  And it readily takes its place in my CD player (the other 5 in there are solid rock music.)  =)
B0000YEEG2|4.0|I didn't know what to expect with this DVD since there wasn't any information available when I ordered it. It was better than I expected in its quality, but was a disappointment with its content. I was expecting 70's style animation (I have seen &quot;Albator&quot; on TV as a child), but was pleased to discover that it is contemporary (and quite spectacular). I also liked the music. The story is quite good, but you will be left wanting at the end; apparently the story will be continued in part 2: &quot;The Tendrils of Fear&quot;. I'm not sure if I would have spent so much money on a DVD if I knew that I needed to get at least one more to get the complete story. This is a disk that should be part of a set, not sold on its own. So, if suspense bothers you, then my best advice would be to wait until part 2 becomes available and buy them both together. Or if you're really patient, wait to see if they get put together in a boxed set and save yourself some money!
B000089RVR|5.0|I have fallen head over heels for Dido's sophomore release, 'Life For Rent'. This is a - there's no other way to describe it - fantastic album. Every song is simply amazing. The songwriting is beautiful and thought provoking, whilst Dido's distinct vocals are absolutely exquisit. From the interesting story behind 'Mary's In India', to the perfectly creepy 'Who Makes You Feel', and even to 'This Land Is Mine' (which puts a smile on my face everytime I hear it), I love every track on this album. My very favorite track on the album is 'See You When You're 40', which includes the beautiful lyrics, <br />&quot;So see you when you're 40<BR>Lost and all alone<BR>Being comforted by strangers<BR>You'll never need to know<BR>Not sad because you lost me<BR>But sad because you thought<BR>It was cool, to be sad.&quot;<br />The standout tracks include 'White Flag', 'See You When You're 40', 'Who Makes You Feel', 'Sand In My Shoe', and 'Do You Have A Little Time'. I would definitely recommend this album, but if you're a fan of upbeat pop music, you probably won't like it. It took me a couple of listens to completely get hooked, but now that I am, I can't seem to turn 'Life For Rent' off.

0553573403|5.0|Out of the blue I picked up this novel.  I had no expectations and wasn't familiar with the author.  This book blew me away!<br />I don't like long epic series that read like the author is being paid by the word.  This novel, the enitre series in fact, is incredibly intricate and very well written. The characters are complex and easy to identify with, the plot is deep and very well thought out, and you just can't put the thing down.<br />I have lent this book to friends and family who don't usually read the Fantasy genre, who prefer Sci-Fi or Fiction, and every one of them has agreed that this is an excellent series and has thouroughly enjoyed it.<br />I would put Martin up there with Frank Herbert.<br />This book/series tops my list.....You'd be a fool to pass it by.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Twenty first century audiences have grown accustomed to anti-war movies, rather than war movies.  I guess that's why this film was so hated. No, Pearl Harbor is not an ant-war film.   But it's not a pro-war film either, if indeed there ever was such a thing.  Everyone knows (except maybe for a few deranged dictators) that war is ugly and horrible.   But this film isn't even ABOUT war per se.  It's about the attack that brought the U.S. into the war.  It's also about the spirit of the Greatest Generation.  <br />This film is told from the American point of view, circa 1941.  Some people think that's unfair, that the film isn't objective enough, or historically accurate enough. Well, maybe I've missed something.  Like all Hollywood historical epics, sure it fudges here and there, but that isn't unusual at all.   Most war movies pretend to be accurate, and they do this merely by taking a critical stance toward the U.S.  Sorry folks, but cynicism and objectivity aren't the same thing.  <br />No, this film isn't Saving Private Ryan.  But the events in that film took place three years after Pearl Harbor, when Americans had suffered countless more deaths.  Private Ryan depicted America deeply entrenched in a costly war, whereas Pearl Harbor was about the opening volley.  Both films are great, but they really shouldn't be compared so much.  They are about two different periods of time.  <br />Moreover, Pearl Harbor was mostly about pilots.  Private Ryan was about men in the infantry.  It's obvious which one would be the darker and more gruesome of the two.  <br />Hopefully, this film will be revisited with a more open mind.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Though i have the clean version of this cd it is the same thing as the origanal without curses. well anywat this cd is AWESOME! her lyrics are very dancebale and catchy, and she sings each song with passion and love. My favorite track on this Album is American Life. especially the rap part in the middle. other standout tracks on this album include Love profusion, Hollywood, nobody knows me, and Die another day but most of the other songs are also great!!!! One of the most moving songs on the album is mother and father. it's about the death of her mother and the music is so catchy it's sure to be a hit in Clubs around the world. This song made me cry the first time i heard it because it was so sad. I love It! However there is one song that I HATE with a pssion it is called i'm so stupid. it is so annoying!! and the beat is even more terrible than the lyrics. overall i reccomend this album to<br />The casual Madonna fan<BR>The hardcore madonna fan (Me!)<BR>pop music fans<BR>Techno fans<BR>EVERYONE!

0440237688|4.0|I've read The Giver twice, once as a confused fifth grade student and recently as part of an online class assignment as a high school Junior. This book never fails to entertain my senses and keep me clutching on to its paperback until I finish the very last page. It's an amazingly artful weaving of words that keeps the attention of all its readers, young and old. It's intriguing to try to fathom a world in which there is no yesterday. This is a world where social classing is non existent. Each and every individual of this community has the same house, the same size family, the same hair style and clothing. If that is not challenging enough, imagine a life built on ignorance rather than past experience and knowledge. A life without memory, without pain, without feeling whatsoever. The story centers on Jonas, on the brink of turning twelve at the beginning of the novel, in a utopian society. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for the colony. Jonas, and those Receivers before him, stores the collective memories of those things which their society has managed to forget over the time they've been apart from the rest of the world. Jonas's then can see his world as it really is. This is definitely a thought provoking tale and full of twists and turns. Highly recommended!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|&quot;The Beatles changed my life forever!&quot;<br />&quot;This is great progressive rock.&quot;<br />&quot;...the greatest music group of all time!&quot;<br />No.  These are not talented musicians.  Beethoven and Mozart were talented musicians.  These four British punks were barely able to play their instruments and could not write songs for the pitiful lives of them.  Very much like British artists of today.  And American ones.  This isn't good music.  Stop saying it's good music just because everyone else is.  You know they're sloppy artists.  Listen to classical if you want good &quot;classic&quot; music.  Hector Berlioz would rip these four poofy-haired blokes a new one if he were still alive.  That was a talented composer.  This is junk, just like everything else to come out of the '70s.  Nixon should've arrested them and sent them to Vietnam to be shot so they could stop making atrocious 'music.'  Good thing most of them are dead now, but I wish people would stop re-releasing their music or having the members write new music.  They couldn't write in their prime; what makes anyone think that an old decrepit walking corpse is going to do any good?<br />Give me all the negative votes you want.  In fact, why don't you email me your death threats at beatlessuck@yourmother.com.  Hail Satan, and to the depths of Hades with these dogs.<br />BTW - The Beatles were the same thing as today's Justin Timberlake.  Media creations for the sole purpose of inoculating the minds of ignorant youths, who obviously still haven't grown up.
1558908382|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie. It's exciting, it's entertaining and also pretty darn funny. Again a great movie !!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I rented the \\"Band of Brothers\\" DVD's just last week and found it totally fascinating. I'm not a fan of HBO because I find shows like \\"The Sopranos\\" and \\"Sex And The City\\" to be nothing but trash but the network really outdid itself with \\"Brothers\\". My Russian born wife was messmerized by the series and could not wait to watch the next DVD. <BR>     I recently read the Stephen Ambrose book and the series follows it very closely even right down to the scene where the German  waiter takes off when Winters and Welsh enter the Berchesgaden Hof dining room. I was especially intrigued by the scene where the C-47's were approaching the DZ and the viewer was treated to a cockpit view of the AA fire in the distance.<BR>     Yes, the language was raw and the combat scenes were extremely violent but that made \\"Brothers\\" all the more historically accurate. I'd recommend it to most anyone and found it to be a wonderful tribute to a generation of men that is quickly leaving us.
0452282152|5.0|If you liked the movie, you'll love the book.  Tracy Chevalier writes like a painter. She's able to create visual moments on the page that hang there and collect together with the inertia of the story, compelling the reader to become part of the world she's creating.<br /><br />In her imagined backstory to one of the world's most famous paintings, Chevalier takes what might otherwise be a run-of-the-mill bodice-ripper plot and elevates it with a poet's eye for image and understanding of motive into something quite unique and beautiful.<br /><br />Chevalier is a very talented writer who has produced a tender and intricate tale illuminating the wonder and danger inherent in immersing one's self in the worlds of love and art.
6305313687|5.0|I borrowed this from a friend a few days ago, and I've watched it about four times. The first time I saw it, it shocked me. The second time, I cried. The third time, I shook my head and sighed at the fact that people like the characters in this movie -do- exist.<br />This movie is, to put it plainly, about racism, and it has a subtle plot of redemption scarred by loss. The first is subject matter few directors or actors would dare to touch, but this movie takes such things to the extreme.<br />Pros of this movie: Excellent acting. I have a new respect for Ed Norton after this; he portrayed semi-psychotic Derek very well. Edward Furlong portrayed impressionable Danny well, and then there were all the subcharacters who added an interesting flavor to the movie. The dialouge is powerful. This movie makes you listen. The locations added that grimy sense of ghetto to this movie, just as it should have. The black-and-white portions of the movie added a strange something to the movie...to me, it added to the black vs. white conflict that Derek encountered when...I won't tell and spoil it. :)<br />Cons to this movie: Well, language, if that insults you. This movie favors the f-word a lot, but it's not for no reason, it has place in the movie. Well, racism, but that's the plot, so don't get it if it bothers you. Violence, and lots of it, but it works into the plot, so again, it makes sense. One sex scene, and one rape scene. <br />Overall, this is a powerful movie that will make you rethink what you thought you knew about racism and how the human mind works. It's so convincing, you almost think it's a documentery, and then the credits roll and you realize the names are fake, and you're back to safety again, away from the horrors of Venice Beach.<br />Definitely buy this.
0380977788|5.0|Dear Reader,<BR>     I would recommend Coraline because, I am the kind of person that likes creepy,adventure novels. Maybe even mystery books, and Coroline was definetly a little bit of each. If you are the kind of person that likes scary books (especilly at night) than Coraline is the book for you. Having the lights off while reading it makes it good, because when lights are off it usally makes you freaked out. There are parts of the book in Coraline which reminds me of the movie, The Shining.

0805047905|5.0|All three of my children LOVE this book...(Sam 6, Allison 3, and Cole 1).  We have two copies in the house because they get read so much.  The pictures are bright and beautiful and each of the children have learned colors, animals, and the fundamentals of rhyming from this excellent book.  I also suggest \\"White Bear White Bear What do you Hear\\"...
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is an amazing portrayal of American and Soviet reactions to a nuclear crisis (Despite the cracks on fluoridation).  The humor is great, and you really have to be thinking about the movie to notice it.  Genius, pure genius.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'll make this review very simple.<br />If you like Led Zeppelin, you'll freakin' love this DVD.
0142004235|3.0|I cannot believe I haven't read this book sooner.  I was taken in immediately by the sheer language of the author.  The prose was so wonderfully descriptive that I could visualize every place, every item, every character- it was as if a movie was playing in my head as I read each word.  It was a classic \\"good vs. evil\\" theme that was realistic in that the good don't always prosper and the evil don't always get what (we feel) they deserve.  The character development was great. Some characters were more complex while some characters were really one-dimensional, however, I believe that was the intent of the author because it made the story work.  The author made me have an opinion about each character, and whether I liked the character or not, I understood his/her actions and cared about what happened to them.  I am now looking forward to reading and re-reading more Steinbeck novels and other classics.<br />You're probably wondering why I only gave this book a 3 star rating after all of this raving.  I deducted a star because of one word - EDITING!  I ran across mispellings, grammatical errors and punctuation errors.  That is unacceptable for a published piece of writing.  Especially for a classic work such as this.  I am shocked that the editor and publisher did not pay closer attention to this.  Otherwise, this book is an enjoyable read.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie + the Infinite Sadness is an awesome CD.<br />(Note: This CD might take a while to warm up to.  I hated it the first batch of times I listened to, but then I let it sit for a month or so.  I decided it to pop it in my CD player, and it rocked.)<br />The first disc starts you out with the pretty self-titled intro, then gets you prepared with &quot;Tonight Tonight,&quot; a cool string epic.  Then you hear the hard rock of &quot;Jellybelly,&quot; the metal-ish &quot;Zero,&quot; the cool &quot;Here Is No Why,&quot; and so on and so forth, through the masterpiece &quot;Galapogos,&quot; and more.<br />And that's just a quick skim thru the FIRST DISC!  There's a whole 'nother batch of these songs!<br />This CD is a masterpiece of alternative rock.<br />GET IT NOW!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I didn't expect much from this cd honestly. I thought that Maynard and his &quot;Perfct Circle&quot; would turn out to be a one-album-wonder sideproject but WOW! Their sound has evolved dramatically since their previous album... they don't sound too much like Tool on this one and their songcraft is simply brilliant. Maynards vocals are just as great as they've always been and the guitarist is incredible. Get this one if you are a fan of Maynard's previous work or just simply like good rock music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD is a mind-blowing disc filled with tracks that make you think, \\"How in the world did they record that song?\\"<br />The disc starts off with the track \\"Airbag,\\" with its really cool guitars.  Then the six-and-a-half minute epic \\"Paranoid Android,\\" which feels like four or five songs all in one.  Then there is \\"Subterranian Homesick Alien,\\" with its soft, jazzy guitar chords.  After that, the acoustic masterpiece \\"Exit Music (For A Film),\\" which starts off acoustic.  Then come in the choir, then a sample of kids playing on a playground (or something like that).  Soft cymbal hitting, than -- BOOM!! -- a giant electronic drum-filled loud thing.  Then all quiets down for Thom Yorke's whispered \\"We hope...that you choke...that you cho-oke...we hope...that you choke...that you cho-oke...\\"<br />After that, you think, \\"How can they top that?\\"  Well, they walk around the point with \\"Let Down,\\" the only so-so track on the CD, but then you meet \\"Karma Police,\\" an acoustic, piano-driven song that is awesome.   The odd \\"Fitter Happier\\" comes next.  (What were they thinking[?!] A freakish computer voice pops up over dark piano samples and electronic bleeps and bloops.  Oh, well, whatever, nevermind.)<br />Just when you thought there couldn't be any more surprises, along came the next 3 tracks.  \\"Electioneering,\\" a (gasp) normal rock song with distorted guitars and awesome drums, proves that Radiohead still can make hard, fast rock music.  Then comes the climax of the album,\\"Climbing Up the Walls.\\"  Yorke sounds like he's singing into a hairdryer plugged into an broken telephone, but that fitts in with the electronic, cold tune.  I can't figure out what the heck the song means (a talking alarm system?  a microwave oven?) but it's still pretty cool.<br />\\"No Surprises\\" is a happy-sounding little song with dark lyrics (wow.  what a surprise).  It has a very cool guitar part, and its pretty catchy.  An awesome track.  The last two songs are OK.  \\"Lucky\\"s pretty cool because itbuilds up, and \\"The Tourist\\" is kinda jazzy, but they pale in comparison to the other songs.<br />Awesome CD, worth every penny.  Kinda like a puzzle, with all the pieces fitting into place.<br />Worth every penny.<br />(Oh yeah, the first time I listened to it, I thought, \\"What in heck was all the hype about?  This [is not good]!, but it grew on me.  Just warning you.)
B00008S2VG|1.0|This is Madonna's lousiest album ever.  It's a complete mess and it's even worse than &quot;Erotica.&quot;  It's incredibly outdated and the music is very plain.  I seriously think that her creativity is gone and her music has gone down hill since Ray of Light.  On half of the songs, she has turn on the vocoder to make her voice sound robotic (which was cool with Cher's &quot;Believe&quot; but the trend is wearing thin now.)  Luckily, I didn't waste my money on this crap.  A friend bought it the day it came out and let me listen to it.  After hearing it, I knew I wasn't buying it.  I used to be a huge Madonna fan, but now she just plain sucks.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|The Alice in Wonderland DVD is released in its original theatrical aspect ratio of approximately 1.33:1 - or as we know it, fullscreen. Before you start bagging any dvd for not being released in widescreen you might want to find out of it was in widescreen to begin with. <br />Further, to all those who are offended by \\"bong\\" smoking or the \\"magic mushrooms\\" you really need to wake up. Kids don't think of drugs when they watch this film, they see it on a completely different level. When I watched it as a child all I saw were funny characters and a world of wonder - It was amazing!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album takes Dream Theater in a different direction. The melodys are pretty much simple and straightforward. But the brutality that comes with some of the tracks will leave you going &quot;whoa&quot; if you're not paying attention. Its not because its brutally fast, but its that fact that this kind of aggression is coming from this group that can leave you stumped. I was reading some of the reviews and found that some felt that this was not their best work. While I agree with them, I still believe that it is superb work by these guys and this album lets me know that they aren't nervous with changing a few things here and there. This is a great album and I would expect anything less from these guys.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|I don't intend to go into detail what's on each disc or what could have been in the set.<BR>With the exception of &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;, &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot;, and &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; George's work recieved little or no air play.<BR>George's Wit And Humor are scattered throughout in songs such as &quot;Blood From A Clone&quot;, &quot;Save The World&quot;, &quot;This Song&quot;, &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot;, &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;.<BR>His Love of Life shines on with such beautiful songs as &quot;Fish On The Sand&quot;, &quot;Breath Away From Heaven&quot;, Life Itself&quot;, &quot;Dear One&quot;, &quot;Mystical One&quot;.<BR>The sound quality is outstanding, the packaging is very attractive. The DVD is fun, and packaged beautifuly. <BR>Looking forward to new updated releases of &quot;Material World&quot;, &quot;Extra Texture&quot;, and &quot;Dark Horse&quot;
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Wicked is a more or less entertaining musical, with an efficient if never inspired score.  The performances are excellent, with Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel turning in remarkable performances.  The CD is admirably produced, and indeed succeeds in making the score sound better than it does in the theatre.<br />The score is efficient, but never all it really might have been.  After the remarkable \\"Defying Gravity\\" the score has nowhere to go, and it goes there fast.  There are some agreeable moments, and \\"Popular\\" is an appealing little novelty number.  Some of the other numbers verge on banality: Fiyero's song \\"Dancing Through Life\\" is an especially dull example of the weakness of much of the score.<br />Be thankful, though, that the CD spares the listener the appalling cop-out ending that the creators of the musical imposed upon the material.  The material has pretensions of being much more than it ever gets around to being.  It settles for being an easy story of female empowerment and friendship.  Basically, they've turned the story into the Broadway musical version of what is popularly known as a \\"chick flick.\\"<br />There are worse ways to spend your time.  Of course, there are better ways, too.
B000005Z0G|4.0|Fulfilling much of the promise showcased on 2Pac's debut album a year earlier, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. offers a wealth of thoughtful moments such as &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; yet still makes plenty of room for good-time celebrations such as &quot;I Get Around.&quot; These two hits in particular make Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. a noteworthy, if sometimes overlooked, moment amid 2Pac's cluttered catalog. They also represent the two approaches 2Pac initially took with his music, emphasizing his thoughtfulness (another insightful highlight being &quot;Papa'z Song&quot;) rather than the thuggishness so often associated with him, particularly in the wake of his death. A few notable West Coast rappers join the festivities here -- Ice Cube and Ice-T on &quot;Last Wordz&quot; and Digital Underground on &quot;I Get Around&quot; -- but 2Pac unfortunately doesn't have any notable producers to support him, as the quickly dated production stands as the album's only potential drawback. Not quite as remarkable as 2Pac's following two masterpieces, Me Against the World (1995) and All Eyez on Me (1996), Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. nonetheless merits acknowledgement, particularly in relation to the string of posthumously released Makaveli-era recordings littering his catalog.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|Once more, Bryan Singer, the director of X-Men brings along a spectacular sequel, which possibly promises more & more. Once you've seen the first, you will definitely want to see the second, especially since you get to see even more of the rather lovely Hugh Jackman.<br />All the old characters are brought back to fight another day, and we also get introduced to some new characters - some of the kids from the school get a bigger role, including Rogue's boyfriend, who will make sure that your drink is always `ice' cold. Another great new character is \\"Nightcrawler\\", played brilliantly by fellow Scot, Alan Cumming, who is almost as bad as Mystique, having at one point to be in make-up for 10 hours! (He appears topless in one scene, so that adds on the extra hours)<br />All the now well known characters appear at the start, but they don't all appear at the end. Now, I wonder what that could mean? I was quite shocked at the apparent death of this particular popular character, as it seemed totally unnecessary, but never mind.<br />Hugh Jackman is terrific once more as Wolverine, although he meets the female version of him, resulting in some rather painful looking scenes. There are also a few glimpses into his past, and it gets revealed about how he came to be as he is.<br />Anna Paquin appears, and gets a quite good role, although the originally `white' streaks in her hair seem to have turned blonde between films! Her relationship with her `ice cool' boyfriend, briefly introduced during the previous film, develops, although not by much, judging by the effect she has on people!<br />In this film, the humans are the baddies, and the renegade mutants join with the good guys to fight the threat. This results in some spectacular action scenes with explosive special effects.<br />There are a huge amount of extras on the two disc dvd version, covering almost everything you could possibly want to know about the making of this film, from pre-production to post-production, including the special make-up effects used on Nightcrawler and Mystique.<br />The four-disc special edition DVD containing both films and stacks of extras is highly recommended and well-worth the purchase price.uding the special make-up effects used on Nightcrawler and Mystique.<br />The four-disc special edition DVD containing both films and stacks of extras is highly recommended and well-worth the purchase price.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Maybe it was his time in prison, or maybe it was simply his signing with Suge Knight's Death Row label. Whatever the case, 2Pac re-emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. With all the controversy surrounding him, 2Pac seemingly wanted to throw down a monumental epic whose sheer scope would make it an achievement of itself. But more than that, it's also an unabashed embrace of the gangsta lifestyle, backing off the sober self-recognition of Me Against the World. Sure, there are a few reflective numbers and dead-homiez tributes, but they're much more romanticized this time around. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it's an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he's ever had on record, handled mostly by Johnny J (notably on the smash \\"How Do U Want It\\") and Dat Nigga Daz; Dr. Dre also contributes another surefire single in \\"California Love\\" (which, unfortunately, is present only as a remix, not the original hit version). Both hits are on the front-loaded first disc, which would be a gangsta classic in itself; other highlights include the anthemic Snoop Dogg duet \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,\\" \\"All About U\\" (with the required Nate Dogg-sung hook), and \\"I Ain't Mad at Cha,\\" a tribute to old friends who've gotten off the streets. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin' divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac's magnum opus.
1400031354|5.0|This is a wonderful, gentle book with mysteries, but with wise words from a wise woman and kind words too, from her kind fiancee.  All in all reading this series ( I have read 2) has been a distinct and very different pleasure. The descriptions of daily life in Botswana and of cultural habits, landscape, etc., add to the pleasure and are never tedious &quot;filler&quot; as they can sometimes be in authors with less talent.  A definite &quot;feel good&quot; book.
B0000024IE|5.0|At the time of its release in March 1990 -- just a mere two years after It Takes a Nation of Millions -- nearly all of the attention spent on Public Enemy's third album, Fear of a Black Planet, was concentrated on the dying controversy over Professor Griff's anti-Semitic statements of 1989, and how leader Chuck D bungled the public relations regarding his dismissal. References to the controversy are scattered throughout the album -- and it fueled the incendiary lead single, &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot; -- but years later, after the furor has died down, what remains is a remarkable piece of modern art, a record that ushered in the '90s in a hail of multi-culturalism and kaleidoscopic confusion. It also easily stands as the Bomb Squad's finest musical moment. Where Millions was all about aggression -- layered aggression, but aggression nonetheless -- Fear of a Black Planet encompasses everything, touching on seductive grooves, relentless beats, hard funk, and dub reggae without blinking an eye. All the more impressive is that this is one of the records made during the golden age of sampling, before legal limits were set on sampling, so this is a wild, endlessly layered record filled with familiar sounds you can't place; it's nearly as heady as the Beastie Boys' magnum opus Paul's Boutique in how it pulls from anonymous and familiar sources to create something totally original and modern. While the Bomb Squad was casting a wider net, Chuck D's writing was tighter than ever, with each track tackling a specific topic (apart from the aforementioned &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome,&quot; whose careening rhymes and paranoid confusion are all the more effective when surrounded by such detailed arguments), a sentiment that spills over to Flavor Flav, who delivers the pungent black humor of &quot;911 Is a Joke,&quot; perhaps the best-known song here. Chuck gets himself into trouble here and there -- most notoriously on &quot;Meet the G That Killed Me,&quot; where he skirts with anti-homophobia -- but by and large, he's never been so eloquent, angry, or persuasive as he is here. This isn't as revolutionary or as potent as Millions, but it holds together better, and as a piece of music, this is the best hip-hop has ever had to offer.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Diane Keaton is outstanding in her lead role in this movie. Jack Nicholson is hysterical. I laughed through out the entire movie.<br />Its wonderful to see a fun, romantic comedy where the actors are mature adults. No kid stuff here, this is a comedy anyone over 35 can relate to and appreciate. My favorite scene is Diane's crying scene - which is still hysterically funny. A great fun movie.
B0000024K1|5.0|Yo! Bum Rush the Show was an invigorating record, but it looks like child's play compared to its monumental sequel, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, a record that rewrote the rules of what hip-hop could do. That's not to say the album is without precedent, since what's particularly ingenious about the album is how it reconfigures things that came before into a startling, fresh, modern sound. Public Enemy used the template Run-D.M.C. created of a rap crew as a rock band, then brought in elements of free jazz, hard funk, even musique concrte, via their producing team, the Bomb Squad, creating a dense, ferocious sound unlike anything that came before. This coincided with a breakthrough in Chuck D's writing, both in his themes and lyrics. It's not that Chuck D was smarter or more ambitious than his contemporaries -- certainly, KRS-One tackled many similar sociopolitical tracts, while Rakim had a greater flow -- but he marshaled considerable revolutionary force, clear vision, and a boundless vocabulary to create galvanizing, logical arguments that were undeniable in their strength. They only gained strength from Flavor Flav's frenzied jokes, which provided a needed contrast. What's amazing is how the words and music become intertwined, gaining strength from each other. Though this music is certainly a representation of its time, it hasn't dated at all. It set a standard that few could touch then, and even fewer have attempted to meet since.
B00005JMTN|4.0|I thought Big Fish had alot of cute, whimsical scenes. But the scenes that really stood out for me were between the realistic Son, and the story-telling Father. The movie shows alot of depth as these two people try to understand eachother. I think this is a good film for families to see together because it balances itself between what is actually going on in the family, along with the history surrounding the past.
B000005Z0E|3.0|Few expected former Digital Underground member Tupac Amaru Shakur to become hip-hop enemy number one when he made his solo debut with this 1991 album. Songs like \\"Crooked Ass Nigga\\" and \\"Tha' Lunatic\\" might have hinted that storm clouds were on the horizon, but there were also excellent advocacy numbers like \\"Words Of Wisdom\\" and \\"Young Black Male.\\" This didn't make him a celebrity, but it put Tupac Shakur on the road to stardom.
B000127LW2|3.0|I have been waiting for Voyager to come out on DVD since Paramount started packaging up the NextGen seasons.<br />Finally, the day has arrived, and I hold my Voyager Season 1 DVD set in my hands.  The packaging is nice and colorful, the DVD's are poorly labelled, and the menus are vague at best.<br />I popped the first DVD in, and managed to navigate my way through the menus.  I found the audio submenu and set it to Dolby 5.1, since that's what my receiver plays, and played The Caretaker.<br />The episode was much sharper than I remember - I don't remember Kes with that awful wig, or Tom Paris wearing that much makeup - that goes to show you just how clear the image is.<br />However, when the theme played, I barely heard it. no bass anywhere.  Ok, maybe my setup is wrong - I changed it to the other vague &quot;Dolby&quot; option in the audio submenu.  no change.  Ok, maybe it's my receiver settings - I popped in my Charlie's Angels CD - BOOM, instant bass (too loud, since I played with the subwoofer to try and get so much as a peep out of my Voyager DVD set).<br />I played another DVD from the series - same lackluster audio.  What happened?  Come to find out, at the end of the theme song when Voyager jumps to warp, the subwoofer drizzled out the slightest amount of bass.<br />I was heartbroken - I'm the kind of guy who will pop in a DVD to play the THX logo to show off my moderately impressive sound system.  I expected the drum beat to give me a foot massage. I expected the lower horn notes to resonate deeper than your average sub-molecular scans.<br />Right now I pray that either I haven't set some obscure setting, or that I've got a bad DVD (neither of which are likely options, but well within the realms of possibility).<br />If anyone else has seen this and knows what's wrong, then please let me know. Thanx
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This movie will no doubt go down in the history of Hollywood as the greatest of all time. This is the one move that has finally captured the true essence of Christ. <br />I agree with &quot;Emotion Without Words&quot; in the comments about the CD &quot;Ancient Echoes&quot; by SAVAE. It would have been wonderful if some of their music had been in this film. I had the privilege of seeing them in concert.  All you need to do is close your eyes and you are transported 2000 years back....as you hear the music that Christ must have heard being sung in the ancient ARAMAIC. It is a most electrifying performance with the instruments of that era. Check out my favorite...ABWOON.. The Lords Prayer. Chilling!!!

B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream is definitely an essential Smashing Pumpkins album. It was the album that got embraced by radio and MTV (back when they cared about the music), thanks to alternative classics such as &quot;Today,&quot;&quot;Disarm&quot; and the anthemic opening &quot;Cherub Rock.&quot; However, despite the hit singles was a very elaborate, sonorous and emotional. Billy Corgan, mostly, wrote some great songs for this album, such as they heavy &quot;Quiet,&quot; and epics like &quot;Silver****&quot; &quot;Mayonaise&quot; and &quot;Soma.&quot; The latter two were cow-ritten by guitarist James Iha. Corgan also produced other ballad-type songs that were very resonant, such as the profound and romantic &quot;Luna,&quot; and the song he dedicated to his mentally disabled little brother &quot;Spaceboy.&quot; Even the 1 and a half minute &quot;Sweet Sweet&quot; is an excellent and lush song. Siamese Dream was not as gargantuan, epic and (in my opinion) as good as Mellon Collie, but the Smashing Pumpkins, and their mixture of alternative, prog, dream pop and psychedelia, were already on their way to being probably the most creative band of the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.

Tim Burton is well known for his darker sense of understanding when it somes to his work that makes him brilliant. Other works, such as &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Big Fish&quot; bring audiences rolling in to see what he has come up with this time.<BR>This movie has all the sense of a harmless movie, but brings it all into a darker perspective that just grips the soul. Whether it be bright colors, a happy family, or an everyday outting, Tim Burton draws the more odd and darkened shade out of it. With wonderful songs and a cast you can't forget, this is one movie that sucks you in.
0811729117|3.0|A very interesting book from a vantage point not often seen.  Carius seems to have been an example of that unfortunately rare breed: the outstanding officer who is totally committed to his men.  Alas, he's not so outstanding as a writer, although the translation may bear some of the blame.  The book is choppy and full of single-sentence paragraphs that read like minichapters, having little to do with the text before or after.  Also, his complete avoidance of any acceptance of the reality of the Holocaust, which he refers to only as \\"atrocity stories\\" wears a little thin.  It seems he hasn't bothered to learn much about the war since it ended.<br />He spends a fair amount of time ridiculing the abilities of the American soldier, then complains that he wasn't treated well in captivity.  One wonders if he would have been happier in Siberia under the Soviets whose ability he so admired.<br />The most fascinating chapter, I think, is about his meeting with Himmler to receive the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross.  A very rare look at Himmler, relaxed and behind the scenes.
B00006G8O1|5.0|What happened when I first heard of this movie? A giant bunny comes to a high school student throughout the movie and tells him to create certain acts of crime such as arson, vandalism, etc. Ya, I had that same look on my face. Seems a little odd, but this movie is definitely one that will get you thinking. With the dark themes and a rather odd sense of humor at times it just makes the movie all the more pleasing. It's a great movie to watch if you really want to get the wheels in your head turning.<BR>The cast was wonderfully put together with familiar stars. The lead role of Donnie Darko is played by the handsome Jake Gyllenhaal (not a bad thing to look at ;) ).<BR>I'd recommend this if you are looking to start a conversation with someone on what you think the main points of the movie are and what it means to you. And because it can get somewhat confusing at times I'd suggest that you clear your mind and be open to the journey that is awaiting you.<BR>I would definitely put it into a category with my top 5 favorites. This is a a movie that you definitely don't want to miss. It has a deep meaningful message and such interest that you will want to watch it over and over again.
0141439785|5.0|Mayor of Casterbridge is a tale about a man named Michael Henchard and the mistakes he makes in life. It is really well written, Hardy has a skill for great storytelling. There are so many surprises and details, which you at first think at irrelevant turn out to be the turning factors of the entire book. Hardy is not one who puts in a lot of useless text, everything has to be thoroughly read or you will not enjoy it. Anyways boys and girls, hope you enjoy this, I sure did
B0001I55OC|4.0|While many feel this film is not very true to the book, it is a pretty fair film adaption of the book. Most of the MAJOR elements are kept in the film and those areas cut mostly involved the character Chris, which is a good thing since it means less Paul Walker.<br />The first 15 minutes pretty much cover the first half of the book, and the rest is kind of spread out over the next 115 minutes. <br />True, when they go back in time they do not take into account the language barrier of Middle English and Middle French, but personally, I wouldn't want to sit through the movie with subtitles, which would have to be present if they kept this in the movie. They could have kept the ear piece part of the book, however, to explain at least part of this.<br />Also, many people seem to feel that Chris being the professor's son is crazy since the professor is Scottish in the movie and Chris is American. Um, believe me, there are plenty of people in the world who have fathers who are of another country and have another accent... I really don't understand this critique.<br />The acting may not be top notch, although Butler is definately the stand-out performance of the bunch, but I have seen far worse acting in other movies.<br />Overall, this is a good movie, not great, but worth watching. Personally, I adored the book and I like the movie. I feel, even with the few changes and unrealistic moments, it is a fair adaption. It is definately NOT the worst adaption of a book EVER... That would either go to \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", \\"Congo\\", \\"Sphere\\" or some other I cannot think about. At least most of the general plot and events are present in the movie, even if they are changed slightly.<br />If you are going to compare this to other medieval movies, or try to take it too seriously (as many seem to be doing), then this movie is not for you. Sure it may not be the caliber of Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, but I don't feel it was meant to be. It could have been much better, but itis not as much of a disaster as many keep exclaiming.
B000002UB3|5.0|ONE IS CRAZY TO NOT AT LEAST LIKE THE BEATLES. THEY WERE WITHOUT QUESTION THE BEST AND MOST CONSISTENT BAND OF ALL-TIME. ABBEY ROAD IS AN EXPERIMENTAL ALBUM THAT FITS TOGETHER LIKE A PUZZLE. EVERY SONG IS MAGNIFICIENT! I WOULD PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR THIS ALBUM, BUT 13.OO IS A REASONABLE PRICE. I AM NEVER ONE OF THOSE CRAZY REVIEWERS, BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN BE FOR THIS LP. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001ADB8C|5.0|This is a re-issue set. It is not an attempt to make a collection of unreleased songs or videos. It is perfect the way it is. To hear the albums with this much clarity is alone worth the price. By now I would hope that Beatle fans would realize that they can't be pleased. Always wanting every release to be exactly like they want with the perfect amount of bonus tracks etc. etc. etc.<br />This a perfect Box set in so many ways. Put the headphones on an rediscover George.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I used to be a big Daredevil comic book fan.  I probably have books ranging over a period of 10 years, though there are some sparse stretches in there.  I haven't read it in the last few years.  If this movie is any indication as to where Daredevil has gone, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the comics.<br />In the books, Matt Murdock is a highly-capable, blind lawyer who, much like Clark Kent, is a humble individual.  In the movie, he's cocky, volatile and a show-off with his super-normal abilities.  In the books, he's almost flawless in his Daredevil guise.  In the movie, he's flawed in virtually every aspect, not just demonstrated through his on-screen antics, but by the scars that cover his body.  Makes you wonder how he's survived.  In the books, he's not afraid of commitment and has had several romantic involvements.  In the movie, he apparently just keeps moving between one-night stands.  Never even had a girl over to his place.  In the books, as with most Marvel characters developed in the 60's, he uses violence only to bring criminals to justice.  In the movie, he is judge and juror and uses violence to execute the criminals.  In short, Daredevil and Spiderman were always sort of cut from the same cloth.  But the characters portrayed in the two recent movies couldn't be more different.<br />Now, had this been a Punisher movie or some other comic character, I would've found it quite entertaining.  But as a Daredevil movie, it was very disappointing because it had almost nothing in common with the Daredevil I remember.
0783240236|5.0|There is nothing that I don't like in this movie.  The characters are all well-drawn and the plot follows along from life.  So much of the world is beyond comprehension . . . even with all our knowledge of science and mathematics and philosophy, we can explain the &quot;how&quot; but not the &quot;why&quot; of things.  And any attempt to do so would be meaningless, just as the phenomenon we see in The Birds is not just beyond understanding, but there is no attempt at explanations.  It is not blamed on a divinity, nor on bad behavior of the people as a prophet would say.  What's the point, that would just be idle speculation.  My favorite scene . . the stares of the people in the Cafe looking out of the window at the man at the gas pump.  Classic.
B000002TP7|4.0|I was watching one of my favorite films, &quot;The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3&quot; on television the other day, and really enjoying the thumping 70's funk soundtrack, when I swore I heard a riff that reminded me of the Beastie Boys! Sure enough (pun intended), i found the sample on &quot;Sure Shot&quot;! <br />AND they even homage the piece in their lyrics: &quot;It's The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3/ If you wanna go around it, come see me/ You can't, you won't, and you don't stop!&quot; (You have to see the film to get the last line!!).<br />Pelham came out exactly 20 years prior to the Beastie Boys' release and they breathe new life into some brilliant source music!
B0000DG00B|5.0|My little brother told me the other day that he didn't like the &quot;new&quot; Allman Brothers (the Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, and Oteil Burbrigde version) because they &quot;jam too much&quot;. This upset me because anyone who knows anything about the Allmans in their earlier years know that they were all about jamming. Later, when they were around long enough to have a larger selection of songs to choose from for a setlist, they got to cut the jamming down a bit. Live At Atlanta International Pop, however, is the best example of why they called the Allmans the Greatful Dead of the South. Classic Greg, Dickey, and Duane right here, pouring it all into Liz Reed (which hadn't been recorded yet at the time) and two superb Mountain Jams. The Allmans were the first to play at Pop and the last to play at Pop (hence the two sets). I like set one the best as everything seems to click just right for the weekend kickoff. No holes barred here ladies and gentlemen, just the Allmans letting it all hang out behind some of the most masterful jams ever.
0385510438|4.0|I like most of John Grisham's book, they are compelling, interesting and suspensful. My favorite is A Time to Kill. The Last Juror was interesting in that it didn't go through a trial from the beginning of the book to the end. In fact, the rape/murder trial in this book lasted just a few pages. Rather it centered on the lives of Willie and his new Clanton, MS. friends, some fun and interesting characters. Willie is fresh out of college and buys a small county newspaper in Clanton, MS with a loan from his grandmother. The story talks of his years there and how he befriended a black, Christian lady and her amazing family during the early 70's in MS. This was my favorite part of the book, reading about Callie and her family and the conversations she and Willie had. She was a great character and certainly made the book for me. Grisham always does a great job of character development--I can always see a picture of them in my mind. It's a good book and kept my interest, but I was a little dissapointed with the end. I felt like there were still stories to tell about what happened to various characters.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code  Doubleday, 2003, 454pp., $24.95<br />Dan Brown  IBSN 0-3-85-50420-9<br /> Though out history, we have looked upon the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton and many others as creative geniuses. In The Da Vinci Code, we take a closer look at those works of art and the message behind them.<br /> Harvard Historian Robert Langdon is visiting Paris while giving a lecture. Late one night, he receives a phone call demanding that he come to the Louver, on of the most famous art museums in the world. A murder has been committed, and whether Langdon knows it or not, he's the main suspect.<br /> Enter Sophie Neveu, a young cryptinologist who is the granddaughter of the man who was murdered. She has no idea who killed her grandfather or why, just that she knows Langdon could not have killed him. Overwhelmed with guilt, Sophie decides to trust Langdon and together they embark along a journey to find out what the mysterious message meant that her grandfather wrote in his final moments. Along the way, Sophie and Langdon discover an age old secret dating back to the time of Christ. This secret threatens not only their lives, but the Catholic Church's legacy.<br /> The Da Vinci Code had me interested from the time I finished the first sentence. You could tell that Dan Brown had done his research from the way he brought to life past artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci in a way that made me want to see the works of art with my own eyes. But what really had me amazed was the way Brown turned one night into a 400 page book. Thanks to Dan Brown, I look differently at issues such as feminism and I am able to believe in my faith enough to question it.
B0000C2IXO|2.0|Let me just say that two stars is really being two kind. This movie is one big joke. The first one was acceptable, but this one is just ridiculous. What were Cameron, Lucy, and Drew thinking when they did this crap? Charlie's Angels was a good series, but this movie is a flat out disgrace. I was so disappointed, not to mention bored to tears. Demi Moore's character as the fallen angel was over-rated, and Crispin Glover's character was even more watered down, or should I say dumbed down (if that's a word) than in the first film. This movie was terrible for it to have so many A-list stars in it.......What a waste!
0316666343|4.0|This book is written from the perspective of a young girl who was kidnapped and killed.  It is an intense book that realistically protrays how such a tragedy effects not only an entire family...but the community at large.<br />I was skepitcal when I first picked up this book, because, in my mind it had the possibility of being very hokey and unrealistic in its protrayal of the victim and her family...however I was delightfully proved wrong.<br />What I found most intersting, though, was parallels that exist between this novel (a work of fiction) and the author's memior called LUCKY, in which she chronicals the life-changing event of being raped on her college campus.  Especially interesting are the methods of rape and the location of the rape of Alice Sebold in comparison to the rape and murder of the main character of this book, Susie Salmon.<br />I highly suggest reading both books and comparing them...it is interesting to see how real life effects a work of art.

B00003CWL6|3.0|This movie has a strong seductive appeal but ultimately is a very shallow look at lust.  Lester is a bit too superficial a characterization of a man experiencing mid-life crisis, as he tries to reclaim his lost youth. Keven Spacey plays Lester with plenty of hubris but with very little meaning.  More impressive, by far, is Chris Cooper's characterization of a deeply repressed father who ultimately has to confront his own sexuality. Unfortunately 3 teens get caught between these two disfunctional father-figures and thereby creating the rub of the story.<br />Lester has become fixated on his daughter's high school friend, played with coquettish delight by Mena Suvari.  Unfortunately Mena never rises above an object of affection, with the camera fawning over her every move as it would in a soft porn movie.  Meanwhile, Lester's daughter (Thora Birch) is drawn to a reclusive, sensitive teen (Wes Bentley) who becomes Sam Mendes' surrogate in the fim.  The young teen turns out to be a voyeur, capturing Thora's every move on digital film.  This oddly narcissistic relationship also fails to develop in any meaningful way other than to provide the occasional ephemoral image such as Wes filming a plastic bag as it is picked up by a swirling wind and tossed about in the air while Thora vacuously looks on.  Then we have Lester's wife (Annette Bening) who is pursuing an affair of her own with her real estate broker (Peter Gallagher) who promises to take her to great heights, only to be shocked that her husband could stoop so low as to work in a burger stand, when they pull up for a hamburger.  The movie would have easily drifted out of control if it weren't for Cooper's mesmerizing performance as the authoritarian father who can no longer discipline his son.  Cooper ultimately is forced to confront Spacey in the most memorable scene of this movie, and probably what earned this film its Oscar.  But, Mendes makes it painfully clear in the closing scenes that he didn't know how to handle the fallout of the confrontation, opting for the easy way out.<br />The characters will grab you and the film is well choreographed, but this is another case of style over substance. It reminded me alot of Magnolia, in its attempt to create highly emotive scenes without providing sufficient background for the viewer to identify with these emotions. I think mostly because Mendes and Ball didn't understand these emotions themselves, but see them as convenient stage tools to create this impressionistic view of suburban America.andle the fallout of the confrontation, opting for the easy way out.<br />The characters will grab you and the film is well choreographed, but this is another case of style over substance.

0446608955|5.0|I saw the movie first and then read the book and the book is so much better than the movie! It also has a lot of differences in the plot. The movie isn't even really based on the book, its more inspired by it with the same outcome. Also, the book is set in the 50's.<br />It'll seriously make you laugh and make you cry. Not even all that long, but has a great message to send across.
B000003TAW|5.0|Early 90s music is mostly known for the &quot;grunge&quot; movement, publically led by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains... but after interest started fading, it seemed like the mainstream were ready for something happier, friendlier, and perhaps even geeky. And just as artistically brilliant as those four.<br />What they got was one of the best debut albums of all-time.<br />&quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is a fantastic song and video, taking place on the set of Happy Days... but this album goes beyond even that. &quot;Say it Ain't So&quot;'s lyrics deal with alcoholism and its effects so smoothly yet directly, &quot;No One Else&quot; describes the tension and jealousy in many modern relationships, &quot;Only in Dreams&quot; is a long, gentle closer with an all-out guitar climax before the cd spins stop... but really, Weezer's selftitled blue album is 10 well-crafted diamonds, which sparkled back in 1994 and are still showing off their beauty today. The production is top-notch, too... it's like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and a perfect touch of indie and college rock.<br />As for Weezer today... well, thanks to the blue album and its followup Pinkerton (which originally tanked commercially but later on found an audience), people expect a lot from this group. They also miss the original lineup, which back then included the masterful bassist and back-up vocalist Matt Sharp. Either way, Weezer continues to make music, and whether or not it's good is completely subjective. But the blue album reached many more people than any Weezer recording since.<br />Check out the blue album's rerelease, which is slated to happen in a month or so. You won't regret it.
B000002KXO|5.0|i have to say I love Stevie Nicks--this group because world famous and I mean made it when Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie<BR>Nicks joined the group. And now with the group having only <BR>4 memebers &quot;Say you Will&quot; was a success because of Stevie Nicks.<BR>&quot;Rumours&quot; was great but played in the ground. The self titled<BR>was the break through. I also love &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; because<BR>Stevie Nicks is one almost every song it is a awesome CD.<BR>Anyway &quot;Mirage&quot; is a great CD that did well but rarely is<BR>looked over. Stevie Nicks songs are excellent. Of &quot;Gypsy&quot;<BR>was played in the ground but her othe two songs &quot;That's     <BR>Alright&quot; and &quot;Straight Back&quot; are among her best. I also like<BR>&quot;Love in Store&quot; what makes this song so great is Stevie's<BR>vocals--they make the song work. Christine sing lead on it<BR>but her other songs are bland. I especially like Lindsay's<BR>&quot;Can't Go Back&quot;,&quot;Book of Love&quot;, and just can't get enough of<BR>&quot;Oh Diane&quot; what a unique song for them. I am going to buy <BR>&quot;Say You Will&quot; because Stevie has alot of songs on it. I think<BR>of all her solo albums my favorite is &quot;Wild Heart&quot; and really<BR>like &quot;Other Side of the Mirror&quot;--Anyway &quot;Mirage&quot; deserves to<BR>be right in there with the band's best work. I love it
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My theory--All through Sophia Coppola's young life, she has been surrounded by people telling her how brilliant and sensitive and wonderful she is. And now, nobody has the guts to say, &quot;Sophia, honey, you've made a terrible movie.&quot; We all know who she's related to, but can't we put that aside and allow this work to stand on its own.  Oh wait, it couldn't even roll over on its own, it would just lie there....completely motionless....while staring at a city skyline.....for looooong periods of time. (Kind of like the characters.) Bill Murray is great in almost every movie I've seen him in, but Best Actor?  How tough can it be to sit around and look alternately pensive and bored for 102 minutes? My biggest problem with these characters is my lack of empathy for them. Bill Murray's character complains that his wife and kids do just fine without him and he feels un-needed? Gee, maybe instead of going to Japan for the big bucks, he should hang out at home and remember little things like birthdays!  I can't stand whiny parents who feel unnecessary when they've done nothing to make themselves important to their kids. His characters success in movies is inferred throughout the movie, so why does he need an additional couple million? Who knows why anyone would pick money over their kids? Ego, vanity, arrogance....pick one. But complaining about the choice made by himself is irritating. The same thing goes for the Scarlett Johanssen character.  She's bored and no one understands her..Sheesh, get a hobby, read a book, go for a walk, learn another language, see a movie, clean up your room, do your laundry, make your bed, just for cryin' out loud....DO SOMETHING other than sit on your windowsill and look depressed. If you're too depressed to think of something to do, then go see a doctor, perhaps you need medication. If either of these characters had spent just a tenth of their time on screen being even slightly useful, maybe I'd actually have cared. This was the longest 102 minutes I ever spent.  In retrospect, perhaps the five people that left the theatre, never to return, were the smart ones. What a pretentious pile of.....fluff this film is. Save your money and read a book, go for a walk, take a long shower, take a nap, call your mom, mow the lawn, stare catatonically into space for an hour and a half, anything will be a better use of your time.102 minutes I ever spent.

B0000C7GG2|5.0|I can not believe what I am hearing!  This is what I have been dreaming of hearing for years!  The perfect blend of flowing classical ecstacy and pure juggular ripping rage.  I am overwhealmed by this album, but I do have one peve with it.  Muse has constantly been compared to Radiohead (and that is truthfully why I checked them out in the first place since Radiohead is one of my favorite groups of all time), but I have to say that Radiohead cannot hold a candle to the power of this album.  (Sorry mr York, but by god, Muse has surpassed you).  My peve is that this is a much greater album than any of Radiohead's releases, but yet this band has hardly any recognition in the United States.  Their music was so amazing before I heard this, enough to force me to travel across the country to see them perform at the Coachella Festival in California, but after hearing this album.... Enough words.  Buy this album or suffer from never hearing the magnifficance of MUSE.
6305546789|1.0|I saw this B-Movie in the theatre with a fellow film school friend and we sat there easily predicting to eachother what was going to happen next.  If you've seen any slasher films before  - you've seen this one.<br />I like the fact that there is a cheapo culture out there, it often produces some charismatic stuff, but please don't endow this bland teenager movie with superpowers because when you were a kid you jumped out of your seat.<br />Fortunately for John Carpenter he has a following of people who apparently just can't get enough popcorn.<br />I like dumb movies too like the AMAZING COLOSSAL BEAST and I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF but I'm not about to give them four stars.<br />To anyone that hasn't seen this yet but is intrigued by the success of the series I say ring another doorbell - they're giving out cheap candy over here.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I love the Austin Powers series, but I feel like this effort was my least favorite of the three thus far.  If you were to watch the first movie, then the second, and then finally \\"goldmember,\\" you will undoubtably see how the characters become so overblown by the third film, drastically different then how they were in the first film.  Take for instance Dr. Evil, who in the first movie was almost serious, and anything comedic was often very subtle, not trying for the laughs, but getting them in a unique fashion.  In \\"goldmember,\\" however, evil is completely out of character and it gets almost ridiculous at times.  Although these characters are all funny, they've all gone through their own \\"personal evolution.\\"<br />\\"goldmember\\" is filled with many memorable moments which is why I still have respect for the series.  The opening of the movie is probably one of the greatest openings for a comedy I have ever seen.  I'm sure many can agree to that.  The whole part with Mr. Roboto is witty and smart, poking fun at our use of subtitles.  The movie also has another great scene behind a curtain, which mirrors another scene in the second movie, where it looks like heather graham is pulling grenades, rats, umbrellas, and other objects out from Austin's behind.  However, the scene in \\"goldmember\\" involves Austin and Mini Me in a hospital room during a rountine physical.  I also have respect for Mike Myers himself, who plays the parts of 4 characters in Austin, Dr. evil, fat bastard, and goldmember.  So all in all, an allright comedy.  It has its moments, but it also has those moments that just go too far and are completely off base with what the first movie in the series was trying to illustrate.  I've heard that a fourth picture is most likely in the works, which I hope they can turn around the series with a final movie that Austin Powers fans truly deserve.

B00005JLXE|1.0|I don't want to waste time faulting every dumb thing in this movie. The costume were OK, the photography fine, even the first quarter of the film was watchable but once Aflecs character starts matching the girl Electra's moves in the play ground it takes a turn down stupid street and never comes back. <BR>That scene is laughable and sets you up for the equally ridiculous Bullseye sequences.  The character looks like a shlemiel with that insignia on his forhead and acts like a two legged chihuahua. His dispatching of a bartender by hurling paperclips into his throat is mind bogglingly idiotic. I don't even want to know why the Elektra character decides that before she goes out to find her fathers assassin she must first change into  leather haute couture.  Lucky for us she's somehow got Ninja Turtle grade skills with those two extreme daggers. Her brutal killing including a shot of the knife blade lifting away her halter back is tasteless and gratuitous. Characters leap and wall ride just like all the twisting leaping ones we've already seen a hundred times before them.<BR>Bullseye falls off a building onto a car and - you guessed it -survives (because a car can break your fall?)<BR>The cast is weak all around. The script wouldn't even make a good comic book.<BR>Don't see this on the strength of SPIDERMAN. That was a fun movie that built on itself scene to scene. This 80 million dollar work of art falls in on itself instead.<BR>The only thing I can imagine being worse is a DVD released with extra material.<br />I saw this rubbish because I wanted to preview it for my son. Like most of the product being churned out today it is totally unsuitable for preteens.
B000056H7W|5.0|And this band uses contrast to the point of driving any listener to pure ecstacy.  This highly talented Sweedish band combine brutal but very organized and progressive death metal, along with metal growling vocals, but also mixes in light beautiful, solemn acoustic and &quot;clean&quot; areas complete with wonderful singing and orchestration and playing from the whole band.<br />The songs are all very complex arangements, way to complex and orchestrated for a metal band.  But this just isn't any metal band.  Opeth songs average around 10 minutes each.  But a few songs are around 7 on this album and one about 1:30 (an instrumental leading to the title track).<br />It maybe hard for some fans of progressive rock to get past the growls of Michael, but if you do you will be treated to a very powerful band that makes contrasting styles into one pure, divine, work of art.<br />Enjoy!

1410102033|2.0|Hitler, although extremely evil, was possibly one of the best orators of all time. He could move crowds like no one else with his powerful speeches and yet virtually nothing he said is still quoted today. Why? Because it was not what Hitler said, but rather how he said it. Do not buy Mein Kampf if you want an entertaining, well written read; rather buy this book for its historical significance. Were this book written by some other unknown man the ramblings about racial purity and Jews as parasitic sub humans would enthrall very few and put most to sleep. However for those interested in how Hitler's mind worked there can be no better direct example than his book, but in literary quality two stars is very generous.
B00005LOUR|4.0|Welcome to the year 2000. Alot of things have changed since 1966.<BR>Just as you wouldn't compare an encyclopedia to the internet, there's no sense comparing the Grinch cartoon to Grinch the movie.<BR>Fortunately the original feature is still with us and still enjoyed by children every holiday season. Now, however, they have a version for their generation as well.<BR>Kids today live in the world of high tech flash and kid TV stations that blare dumb jokes and comercials 24 hours a day.<BR>They play extreme sports, have their own fashions and vacation in Disneyworld.  Movies need to be in touch with their audience and this one is.<BR>Some people complain that it's \\"too loud\\" and garish - they cringe at the nasty jokes ( which are funny enough to be forgiven and - compared to the really vapid trash in so many movies today -  are nothing ) and bemoan the dark edge of some of the scenes. Alas, not everything can be all things to all people - - -unless they are kids.<BR>Ask an eight year old to give you his oppinion and he'll probably tell you that it was funny and cool and sometimes scary.<BR>It doesn't get much better than that.<BR>The Grinch also gives us something else - a benchmark performance. I always suspected Jim Carey had uncommon talent but his scripts up till this one were dreadful. His portrayal of the Grinch belongs in the company of Karloff's Frankenstein, Lugosi's Dracula, Betty Davis in All About Eve as  a quintessential pairing of actor and role. <BR>Ron Howard's direction must have been good because I didn't notice it. I got the feeling you were watching people having fun while working. It flows well and the characters instead of the camera propell the film. A nice touch, perhaps the directors, is the last long pull out from the banquet hall in Whoville to an arial view to a cosmic view that reveals itself to be in actuality an extreme close up of a single slowflake drifting with it's million brothers on route to a fleeting existance before melting.  Ithink that puts the themes of greed, revenge, rage and our time together nicely in perspective.<BR>The Flintstones are a beloved classic too but the movie version had no merit.  Are you really going to be upset that now there are two succesful versions of Dr. Seuss' wonderful book?
B00000DCHD|5.0|Just like the man himself, &quot;52nd Street&quot; is obnoxious and overambitious but thoroughly lovable. After &quot;The Stranger&quot; found Billy flirting with the dark side of AM radio, he went after a streetwise blues &amp; jazz sound with &quot;52nd Street.&quot; He found it, sometimes.<br />But even when he missed and overshot, he created some great, lasting music. &quot;Stiletto&quot; has an irresistible groove and some impressive hellcat piano work, while &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; and &quot;Half a Mile Away&quot; find him approaching a maturity that carries his angry-young-man themes into a realistic setting. The set's centerpiece, the would-be epic &quot;Zanzibar,&quot; is notable for its attempt to shoehorn streetwise romantic cliches into an insanely ambitious arrangement. Featuring trumpet solos by Freddie Hubbard and shifting movements, &quot;Zanzibar&quot; is one of the most entertaining and interesting failures you'll ever want to hear. Which means it isn't a failure at all, but a joyously ridiculous piece of music.<br />The album's standout, however, is the gorgeously layered &quot;Until the Night.&quot; Billy's not the most lovey-dovey fellow, but &quot;Until the Night&quot; is one of the great love songs in history, a tough, unsentimental track that acknowledges how crucial it is to share love when times get difficult. The song aims high and scores even higher - it's a truly transcendent piece of work.<br />Hey, I'm a Billy Joel fan, so I'm gonna love most of what he does. &quot;52nd Street&quot; might be my favorite album of his. I'm aware that it's not perfect - but heck, who wants to hear a perfect album anyway? For all his forced tough-guy stances, for all his &quot;I'm a white boy singing funky blues&quot; pretense, he hit enough homers with this album to make anyone a true Billy believer.<br />Oh, and when I was a kid, I assumed verse two of &quot;Zanzibar&quot; really was about baseball.
B00013F38K|1.0|Let me spell it out for you since some of you are a bit slow to recognize racism. What they did in Kung Fu was like if they cast Tom Cruise in \\"Roots\\" in the role as Kunta Kinte and painted his face black. Do you think that's ok? But no you say, it doesn't matter WHO's actually cast in the role ONLY that the story of Roots was so wonderful and educational. Or would it be more palatable if I practiced revisionist history and said that Kunta Kinte was half Caucasian and that's why we're going to cast Tom Cruise in the role? Anyway you choose to downplay what they did with the show is inexcusable. No, there were no half Caucasian, half Chinese Shaolin Monks at ANYTIME in the history of the temple and any attempts to change history just so they can cast a Caucasian actor in the role that should have gone to an Asian person is plain racist. Just like if Roots' producers attempted to cast Tom Cruise in the Kunta role and say that he's half Caucasian. And don't use the old standby excuse of ,\\"oh, there weren't any Asian actors around.\\" How did you think they filled the Sulu role on Star Trek? They didn't go to Japan for him. Asian actors from that period will tell you that no one wanted to cast them- racism.<br />Hey, since you guys are so easy going I have a screenplay that I would like you to evaluate for a possible movie. It's a movie about George Washington. We're going to cast within the historical context BUT for the role of George Washington we're going to cast Chow Yun Fat. We'll cast him because other actors like Tom Hanks, or Cruise are very busy with other parts and expensive too. We'll just say that George Washington was actually from the far east and he helped Americans win the revolution and our forefathers were so thankful for all that he did that they decided to overlook his race and elect him our first president.  Yes, this will be a drama and we'll try to make it as authentic of a period piece as possible AND we'll add many anecdotes about life....so whatdo you guys think?<br />Look, if you can't recognize that it's racism then you don't know the definition of the word. Boy, didn't you people learn anything from the show?
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Wow, what a great movie. It's one that makes you think about it for a few days, and changes your outlook on life. I must say it changed me. It's a little different but it's a great story and it really makes you think.
0385510438|4.0|I'm a Grisham fan as well and of his books my favorite is his first: &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;.  I liked that this book takes place in the same town as the first: Clanton, Mississippi. But was disappointed that it isn't as good a read as the first. I think Grisham's earlier books were without a doubt his best. Still, it's an entertaining book and it was interesting to read the transformation that takes place with Willie Traynor.
B00000IMTG|2.0|I find it interesting that in all of these starstruck reviews no one raises an obvious question: How do you explain a live album that virtually ignores their two greatest albums (Rising and Long Live Rock and Roll)?  Answer that question reviewers.  I would have been seriously ticked off if I had attended this show.  Kind of like seeing Zeppelin and they play nothing off of IV - no Stairway, no Black Dog, No Rock and Roll, no nothing.  One song from Long Live Rock and Roll and half a song from Rising?!?!  Are you kidding me?  These are their two greatest albums, people! Can someone explain this?  That's not to say that what is on this album isn't okay - the problem is (with the exception of Man on the Silver Mountain, 16th Century Greensleeves, and Kill the King) it's all second rate material.  Sorry, but Blues, Catch the Rainbow, and Mistreated are nothing more than extended (WAY-extended) B-sides that go on forever.  I don't know what Ritchie and Ronnie were smoking before this show, but ignoring Long Live Rock and Roll and Rising should be unforgivable to the Rainbow fan.  If you're a diehard, have it in your collection, but be prepared for disappointment on the song selection.
0679731377|5.0|I thought this book was weird when I had to read it for a college course, but I have since referred to it in nearly every other course I have taken, as well as numerous papers and occasionally even in conversation.  The theme of the dominant narrative is one not mentioned by other reviewers.  The various chapters address how what contemporary society knows of history is what the strongest wanted the story to be.  Barnes says that the strongest, the &quot;winners,&quot; are also the most ruthless, and therefore the least moral and least fit to write history...and yet that is the way of the world.  Very interesting.  Very thought provoking.
B0001HAISG|5.0|My wife and I have seen Peter Pan many times since it opened on Christmas day.  This is the definitive version of Peter Pan that any future production will be measured against.  The casting is dead on the mark!  Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect embodiment of Peter Pan.  Wendy is portrayed with determination by Rachal Hurd-Wood.  I can't imagine a better Hook than Jason Isaac delivers.  He also plays the part of Mr. Darling.  Lynn Redgrave as Aunt Millicent is quit funny in the shadow scene.  As for those playing Mrs. Darling, John and Micheal, Nana, the Teacher, the Messenger Boy, the Bankers, the Lost Boys, the Pirates, the Mermaids, the Indians, and who could forget Tinkerbell are all wonderful in their respective roles.  The sets are very detailed and beautiful but not necessarily realistic looking.  This is as it should be in my opinion.  The special effects are top notch.  This is especially evident after Peter looses his shadow.  At first  impression something just doesn't look right as you watch Peter return to the nursery.  Then it hits you why it looks that way as Peter and Wendy interact.  He casts no shadow while she does. So making it look wrong makes it look exactly right!  The script follows Barrie's book very closely except for the ending.  Opting for a somewhat sad ending instead the downright tear jerker Barrie's would have produced.  According to an interview with Jeremy Sumpter the Barrie ending was filmed, it will be included on the DVD release in the \\"extras\\" menu.  If you watch the credits you will see this movie is dedicated by its executive producer Mohamed Al-Fayed to his son Dodi who died in a car crash with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.  Dodi Al-Fayed was the executive producer on Steven Spielburg's 1991 movie Hook.  Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground, dedicated in 2001  is in London's Kensington Gardens the birthplace of the Peter Pan story.  It features a pirate ship, a water play area, and teepees.  It's built on the former site of a playground donated by J. M. Barrie who authored Peter Pan.  One of Diana's favorite charities was London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.  Before Barrie's death in 1938 he bequeathed the rights to Peter Pan to that hospital.  In 1988 the rights ran out.  In 1989 Parliment re-established those rights to Peter Pan as a 1 time special exception for as long as the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital exists.  So if you do purchase this great movie in a small way you are helping sick children all over the world.  You see the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital inturn supports children's hospitals throughout the world including Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland Ohio near where I live.
0688163173|5.0|Throughout this book, I suspected how it would end but kept telling myself surely Mr. Lehane wouldn't do that to his readers.  But he did.  And even though I expected it, it still caught me off guard and brought tears to my eyes.  Lehane is the master at the complexities of the human persona.  The book is full of twists and turns and hidden secrets behind the characters comments and faces.
B000127LW2|3.0|Star Trek is an awesome show and with the introduction of Voyager it gets even better.  Although I am really unhappy with the packaging of the DVD's.  I mean when TNG came out the boxes where nice and very protective, I mean we payed 100 dollars or more for the sets, they should be nice.  Then we got DS9, they went a little cheaper for the cases, but I think they made up for it with the images on the disks.  But with Voyager, come on, whats the deal.  Really cheap plastic case, mine already broke, and they disks are just plain silver.  Nothing on them, and you really have to look to see even whats on them.  Paramount needs to take a look at what they give the folks in Europe as compaired to here in the USA, have you seen the box sets that came out over there????  Well they are nice.  Please Paramount get a clue and fix this mess with the rest of the 6 seasons.  I know I'm not the only one who posted a review like this....
B0001CCXY8|3.0|Look!  Having been a CC fan since 1992, I have seen them have some great albums, and some great tracks!  I have always thought that Corpsegrinder is a much better vocalist than Chris Barnes ever thought of being.  They have changed their style minimally over the past 15 years however, and it is starting to get old.  Wretched Spawn is a pretty decent album, that has a brutal opening track, and a couple of really good ones after that (namely &quot;Decency Defied&quot;).  But it sounds like Jack and the gang are starting to run out of ideas.  The albums are starting to sound a lot alike in more recent years.  Wretched has a few more intricate riffs and chords to it, but it really isn't too much better than Gore Obsessed, which really wasn't all that good.  Guys, it is either time for a much needed overhaul, or it is time to retire!
B0000WN0VY|5.0|This album is as simple as water. Pure and intense. Damien sits down with you in the room and tells you his storys like you were an old friend of his. He cries. He laugh. He screams. Acoustic guitar moves through the entire work. Cellos and violins are the punctual emotional carpet. A male choir comes out from darkness while you are drained in his music. If you are a musician you must have it. If you are in love you must have it. If you are not in love you must have it. If you simply listen to music, you must have it! It's a poetry pump!
0385504209|5.0|I enjoy all of this writer's books.  His characters are always characters the reader can connect with and his plots always deliver!
B00005JLWN|4.0|I knew nothing about this movie when i started watching it...actually I only started watching it by sheer fluke.  Twenty minutes into the movie I had to turn around and give it my full attention.  It does have a Matrix feel, but I agree with a few other reviewers; you can't comapre it to the Matrix...I would go so far as to say it's better than the Matrix - mostly because Keanu Reeves is a horrid actor who annoys me to no end (...\\"I know Kung Fu\\"...although this is not to say I don't enjoy all three Matrix films).  Christian Bale is ten times a better actor, and possitively OOZES anger and frustration and uncertainty throughout his transformation.  He remains a quietly commanding presence and positively kicks butt in the flick's stellar action scenes.  The plot is a good idea - although slightly cheesy at times - but I think one has to look at the movie in terms of the overall message, to appreciate the film as it should be appreciated.<br />I only gave it four stars because the ending is kind of cheesy - I got the feeling that the director was trying too hard to give it a happy ending - it's a little TOO happy.
B00018D44U|5.0|I was actually not a huge fan of her first album. I thought it was pretentious and boring to say the least. I bought this album mainly because she does a song with Dolly Parton on it who I adore. This is so much more soulful and real than her last album. It's alot more rootsy and not as ballroom dancing. My favorite album of the year so far.
B0000255CL|5.0|For lovers of Black Metal in general, few titles can match this. This is one of Immortal's finest releases, and Immortal was a leader in this genre. It is raw and powerful and should be in any Black Metal lovers collection. The only thing that is remotely disapointing about this album, is that it has to be bought as an import in North America and is not very long for its price. Buy this if you like bands such as Emperor, Dissection or Borknagar. If the only kind of Black Metal you like is Symphonic Black Metal, you may find this harder to listen to than I did. I like both kinds of Black Metal, but this is heavier than COF or Dimmu Borgir.
B000089RVX|1.0|If you do not even consider this cd gothic, or the best thing it ever happened please move on. But if you think this album is great, you are deeply mistaken. I'm not going to talk about every music, because sincerely this album isn't worth taking that much time. The vocals DO ARE GREAT!! SHe's a wonderful singer, and her voice would be perfect for a real metal band. But that's about it.... the lyrics are non-sense and if you know anything about music, you can guess the whole song, just by listening to the first 15 sec. It's pure NU-Metal. The guitars are weak, and they sound like a really bad Lacuna Coil's rip-off. And every single one of you who say WOW what an amazing display of good music, please try to listen to REAL goth metal bands, like Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, etc... before judging this as good
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  Completely lacking any structural plot, this film did not even make sense.  The characters were bland, the kareoke singing was nearly intolerable...  Someone explain to me how this movie became so popular!<br />However, if you like watching two boring people go out to lunch in Tokyo a lot, laying on their bed staring at the wall and aimlessly wondering around, maybe you'll like this film.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I thought this would be another cheap Blade/Matrix rip off.<BR>It actually stands on it's merit, with another concept.<BR>This is no Blade admitidly and Kate Beckinsale is certanily no Wesley Snipes! But let's face it she gives Carrie Ann Moss a run for her money on the looks department. Besides that she is confident in the action department, with the token twin handguns on display. I like the plot of werewolfs feuding with vampires,<BR>the twist is good for what it's worth.<BR>It's nice to see Bill Nighy as a super villian, escaping type from ghastly Brit comedies like Love Actually.<BR>At the end of the day order a Pizza and drink a couple of Budweisers and enjoy the show!
B00001NFCY|2.0|Ah Creed. To think that when I heard their first album I thought they had potential. They might have, but that all ended with Human Clay. I owned this cd for a little while, and I must admit, sometimes I really enjoyed listening to it. However, one thing stuck out to me like nothing else - all the songs are the EXACT same. They're the same tempo (I swear they used a metronome on the same tempo for the whole dang cd), the same structure, and the list goes on. It gets to the point where you might as well put one track from the album on repeat and you're not missing anything. Amazon chose an excellent word: redundant. Seriously, there are SO many other, better bands out there if people would just make the effort to find them. Unfortunately, that would require effort, and heaven forbid we do anything on our own. I'll get off my soapbox now, but hopefully this was helpful to anyone who was thinking of wasting away precious money on this.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is an astonishingly clever take on the Peter Pan story. There is so much going on in this film that you might not notice the little gems the director lovingly tucked into each scene; The wisp of moustache cloud that blows away from Michael upon hearing the dreaded name \\"Hook!\\"; the literal theme of closing the window on childhood actually gets a scene in a wonderful, but brief, struggle between Pan and the parents at the nursery window. The palette and lighting are rich and candy-colored, and the cast is spot on. It also has a gorgeous soundtrack and a musical theme that suits it to perfection. The most stunning aspect of this movie, however, has to be the writing. The dark and sexual undertones are something out of Psych 101 - a refreshing view that makes this coming of age story hold even more weight. Bittersweet and beautiful. The filmmakers and cast should be proud. It's just a shame this came out at Christmas with all the big box office press and Oscar contenders overshadowing it.
B00005JM02|4.0|I enjoyed this animated film,I mean it was really good.A thought this film was going to be a joke, but I was wrong.Really worth watching.
0345404475|5.0|In 2021, after World War Terminus, life on Earth has changed forever.  Those who were not killed either emigrated to other planets or chose to remain on a tainted planet.  With most species of animals dead, live specimens are prized possessions, and for those who can't afford a live animal, companies build artificial ones.  Some even build artificial humans.<br />Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter, sent to find and to retire rogue androids, or \\"andys,\\" who manage to find their way back to Earth.  The government has banned them, fearful of what they might do, especially since they blend in so well with regular humans.  But, the more contact that Rick has with the Nexus-6 android Rachel, the more he begins to question what life is.  Can an artificial life form have empathy?  What happens when a human starts to have empathy for an artificial life form?<br />Philip K. Dick's masterful novel deals with these issues in a fast-paced, realistic environment.  All the characters are finely drawn, especially the andys, and the intelligent story keeps your attention.  I also found it relevant with what's going on in the world today.  It's one of those novels that I just couldn't put down.  A superb sci-fi novel.
B00018D44U|4.0|While I loved &quot;Come away with me,&quot; this one has lots of great songs, too, and I definitely would recommend it to anyone who loved her previous album. My favorites so far are &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Those Sweet Words.&quot; I think some of the other reviewers expected too much or something drastically different, but this one is great and definitely a quality second album.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended version of the movie (by 43 minutes) is *better* than the theatrical release. We see more of Treebeard (from the books) plus a much better back story of the troubled relationship between the Steward of Gondor and his sons. Little scenes with Gollum and Sam also improve this storyline as well. I can't imagine that Peter Jackson wasn't furious that this wasn't the theatrical release -- it really fills out the characters and the film, without feeling too long.
0156027321|1.0|Our library has chosen &quot;Life of Pi&quot; as the &quot;One Book Arizona&quot; selection, and, as the last one I read was a Barbara Kingsolver novel that I truly loved, I thought that this book would satisfy me equally well.  How wrong I was!  As much as I love Tom Hanks, his &quot;Castaway&quot; movie was boring, and as much promise as the 45 pages contain, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is ultimately boring.  After all, not much happens stuck on a lifeboat for 227 days.  If Martel wanted to write about philosophy, why didn't he just do it honestly and not deceive readers into thinking they were getting a great novel?  There are a few nuggats of value here, but you have to sift through a lot of dung to find them.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|I LOVE Pink.  MISSUNDAZTOOD was my favorite album of 2001.  I immediately went to the store on the day TRY THIS was released to buy it.  And it's just ok.  I admire Pink for trying something new, and it's not bad.  I just don't ever have a desire to put it on.  It usually sits on my shelf and collects dust.  Unlike Missundaztood which I played out.  Like I said, it's not bad.  It's rock-ish.  But it's boring and the songs all blend into one.  I was disappointed and unimpressed.
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this album a few months ago and I end up mentioning it every time music is the topic.  You'll never grow bored listening to the album because it offers such variety.  This band can not be categorized and is for anyone longing for an album that continually suprises.  I often move an album from my car and replace it with a new one after I get bored with it, but this one has never been shifted out and I don't anticipate replacing it any time soon. This is easily one of my favorite albums and I can't wait for the next one.
B00006879E|2.0|I bought this CD for the two smash hits Harder To Breathe and This Love...so upbeat, melodically strong and great material.  They fused various genres of music together nicely in these hits.  Then the confusion sets in...<br />After listening to the rest of the disc, is this the same band that recorded Harder To Breathe and This Love??  The singer's voice sounds familiar, but the material is ANYTHING BUT FAMILIAR.  I have not heard a more polarized album since Annie Lennox's &quot;Bare&quot;.  The style and song structure on the balance of the album are completely different.  Even the musicianship is different, which puzzles me.  Could they have recorded these songs in different decades and put them together for this release?  I love songs 1 and 2, but despise the rest of the album.  <br />Bottom line: A little variety is good, but this album has too much contrast stylistically, which destroys the overall album quality.  I am still glad to have this my collection for the first two songs, but I doubt the rest will ever seen the laser again.
B00005JLYW|5.0|Ok, seriously, this is my favorite movie ever. I watch it at least once a week. The acting is great, the fighting is breathtaking, and the Angels are better than ever! The plot is solid, and the character development is astounding. This installment lets you into the Angels pasts, and personal lives. I don't know about you, but I was left wondering &quot;Will there be a Charlie's Angels 3?&quot; THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!
B00000GAIW|5.0|This is a great concept album that tells the story of a poor fellow named Aqualung in middle age era England. The story is told throught frequent use of guitar, flute, drums and bass and it never gets old. The music ranges from raw rock such as on the title track to hushed tender melody like On Locomotive Breath and Won'dring Around. This is the definitive Tull album along with Thick As Brick and A Minstrel in the Gallery. It never ceases to become old due to variation in styles. Blues, classic and rock music are most dominant on the album and from one cut to the next you dont know which one will pop up. Its a just plain out great album!
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Holy smoke, kids, what a great movie!  I haven't seen a movie with this much magic, sincerity, laughs, tears...I just can't say enough about it.  If you are a \\"grown up\\" it will make you feel like a kid again (I left the theater wanting to play pirates!) and if you are a kid it is an excellent adventure. P.J. Hogan has truly directed a masterpiece and I highly recommend it to ANYONE!!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The plot has been described by other reviewers. I am surprised that so many people rave about this movie, both within and out of amazon.com. I found it to be no great shakes. My opinion is that when you're in a foreign country you should go out, try to adapt, see what's hot and not, basically live a bit like them and see how you like it. Clearly the makers of this movie don't agree with me. Else they wouldn't have made the lead actress (who plays the part impeccably though) sit in her underwear and stare out of her hotel room picture window for so long. Maybe its meant to 'mean something', but personally, as a guy who's been to his share of non-native language countries, I didn't identify with that at all. The only funny part was when Bill Murray was shooting the scotch ad. The end was very well made, but that makes it a sad movie. Other than that, its painstakingly slow.<BR>That the director could show a bonding between a man and woman at a deep level without using nudity or fluid exchange is creditable. I guess.
B00004SUED|5.0|I suggest owning both this version and the US version (for the die hard fans of course).<br />Some songs that are on both versions are different versions, so it's a treat to own both.
1563898586|5.0|It is the late nineteenth century, and the dawn of the new century brings with it fresh worries. As fearsome techno-pirates and criminal masterminds threaten the stability of the empire, a group of five unlikely individuals are brought together - Miss Mina Murray, a recently divorced young woman who's name hangs under a social black cloud following her suffering the attentions of a certain Transylvanian nobleman; Mr. Alan Quatermain, the fabled explorer of the dark continent recently turned to opium addiction; Captain Nemo, the embittered techno-pirate and master of the incredible underwater vessel NAUTILUS; Hawley Griffin, the `Invisible Man', a psychopathic rapist and murderer; and Dr. Henry Jekyll, an exiled British chemist constantly battling his murderously savage alter-ego, Mr. Edward Hyde. This group is charged recovering a top-secret alloy from the clutches of an Insidious Doctor from the Orient, who has based himself in Limehouse - however, all is not as it seems, and it would appear that they have as much to worry from their employer - the mysterious `M' - as any other foe...<br />In this series, Mr. Alan Moore (of Watchmen and From Hell fame) and Mr. Kevin O'Neil create a fantastic tour de force of Victorian literature which brings together such disparate elements as the scientific romances of Verne and Wells, the social documentary of Dickens, the pulp mystery of Conan Doyle, the feel of contemporary `steampunk' and even period pornography into a rollicking, page-turning adventure story which stands heads and tails above most `proper' books, let alone the much maligned `graphic novel' genre. And in doing so, they breathe new life into beloved old characters and scenarios, and create a world populated with practically every product of the human imagination. O'Neil's artwork creates a wonderfully realized steampunk version of the nineteenth century, a marvellous world of Victorian skyscrapers and airships and fantastic machinery, and complements the storywell. A fantastic, perfect adventure story.<br />Rule Britannia.
B000002H97|5.0|This CD kicks ass!!! A lot of nay-sayers put this band down for selling out. First, I'd like to ask &quot;If you could be rich and famous would you change your music?&quot; The answer, whether you want to admit it or not is yes. Metallica didn't want to admit this. And just b/c their style changed a little doesn't make them sell-outs. They just matured as musicians. People don't understand that every single song-writer will eventually change the way they write as they mature. Anyway, if you like the singles on this CD you'll love it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'm fascinated by the reviews here on Amazon. It's interesting to me to see those posting negative ones complaining about ballot stuffing when an awful lot of the negative ones give a distinct impression of being written by the same person. I also wonder what kind of individuals go out of their way to trash something they don't like, and the people who disagree with them. There are so many bad commercial movies out there (Matrix II and III anyone?), and it really seems to annoy some so much when someone makes a good, more personal movie.<br />Although \\"Lost in Translation\\" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.<br />Sofia Coppola's script is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen to develop their characters' relationships through looks, gestures, moments of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.<br />Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer (played by Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally. <br />Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land. <br />And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are somewhat more amusing. Some, most notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.<br />Film-makers sometimes don't do so well when they are visiting another culture. Even a mostly observant director like Wim Wenders can find him or herself coming over as a cultural tourist, as Wenders did in \\"Tokyo-Ga\\". <br />Coppola and cameraman Lance Acord take us through a similar landscape, of pachinko parlours, video game arcades, and karaoke bars, but they're less overwhelmed with the environment and a bit more willing to draw satire from it. A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols \\"God Save the Queen\\" in a karaoke bar, does - after all - have potentially humorous overtones. <br />And those who complain about perceived \\"racism\\" fail to notice that the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant. <br />Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot.But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple. <br />Sofia Coppola's casting is inspired. The origin of the film was the city of Tokyo itself, which Coppola felt she wanted to put on screen, But once she'd decided that she began to look for characters and - from the beginning - had Murray in mind. In \\"Lost in Translation\\" Murray gives free rein to both his comic ability and his sensitivity.<br />Cast opposite him, Scarlet Johansen is about five years younger than the character she's playing. She's not yet even twenty, but she is already more than able to suggest a level of complexity far beyond her years. <br />Much the same statement also applies to director and screenwriter Sofia Coppola. Some have been sceptical about how someone so young could get into the head of a middle aged guy having a mid-life crisis. It doesn't surprise me so much. Coppola clearly possesses the art, insight and sensitivity to do it. And the only criticism I have about \\"Lost in Translation\\" is that it's all over way too fast.
0451207521|5.0|The jackdaw is a bird and, in this case, the code name of a group of six female British spies in WWII. They are assigned the daunting task of infiltrating a French chateau that serves as the communications center of the Nazis. Their mission is to destroy the communications of the Nazi northern European theatre on the eve of the D Day invasion thereby wreaking havoc in the Nazi defensive coordinations. Flick Clairet is the leader of this intrepid bunch and must deal with, not only the risk of the mission, but also the cattiness of her team. On the opposite side is Dieter Franck, a Nazi intelligence officer assigned by Rommel to thwart the efforts of the French resistance. He manages to stumble upon the mission of the Jackdaws. Franck is also a highly effective, yet ruthless, interrogator and with a team of sadistic Gestapo agents, obtains his information about the group. It quickly becomes a cat and mouse game to see if the British agents succeed.<BR>     Ken Follet has returned, once again, to the arena that made his reputation-- WWII spy intrigue. He has, by doing so, written one of his finest works and may be one of the best WWII spy novels in many years in terms of sheer thrills, rapid fire pacing and truly fun characters. Follett alternates the point of view between Flick and Dieter Franck so we always know what the other side is doing. This technique also serves to develop a sense of sympathy for both sides. Even though we know Dieter represents true evil, we also come to understand that ultimately he has a job to do and must do it at all costs even if he must make a pact with the devil. In spite of the horrors around him, he is a man with moral principals who justifies his actions by claiming he derives no enjoyment in the torture he must use to obtain his information. Flick is also a character consumed with conflicting emotions. She must also ruthlessly kill and justify her action under the umbrella of a war. The alternating point of view provides, not only this contrast in goals and ideology, but, propels the action faster and faster as Dieter pursues Flick. Ultimately, the pages fly!
0440238609|2.0|Pullman presents the reader with an alternative view of the metaphysical and physical. God, spirit, soul, matter. He's got some nice ideas and makes a decent effort to explore and develop them, but in the end it's lacking in credibility. I mean, a story's got to posess an inner credibility, an inner logic. Here, Pullman's story has too many flaws. Reading the pages, I give up trying to believe in his universe(s) and the last book became purely a \\"make it through\\"-run. But OK - apart from serious faults in fundamentals, Mr. Pullman has a good command over language and scenery. He writes well, and has a nice imagination. I'll give him that. Some reflecting on the art of storytelling, and Pullman will be a winner.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'll give it 5 stars. This is very much like French New Wave movie from the early 1960's. The only things that were missing were that it was in modern day Japan, and no jump cuts. Check out Cleo from 5 to 7, or My Life to Live, if you like Lost.
B000002HMH|4.0|ME myself first heard MEtallica only two years ago (yes, I a myoung) on a small compilation CD (copied). It had everything from Four Horsemen to Fuel. That's why I didn't look too much at which album the stuff came, and so I enjoyed the whole album...<br />Load is not a METAL CD. It is definately Hard Rock with country and alt thrown in. Yes, I can understand why hardcore fans will want to get the heavy/thrash sound of the 80s back, but Load is just a solid album of concrete rock songs. Until It Sleeps, Hero of The day continue the Unforgive light/heavy ballad form, and do it well. Songs like King Nothing and Ain't my B***h are good rock anthems with intelligent lyrics and groove, proper rock sounds, highlighting Metallica's influences from the 70s.  Outlaw Thorn is a 9-minute epic that is the Hard Rock equivalent of ...And Justice for All's pure metal title song.<br />Load is different from 80s albums as teh songs are slower, the themes are different, the sound is less metal. This is not selling out, in my opinion, it is changing the sound - would you want MEtallica to redo Master of Puppets year after year????<br />Solid four stars for a solid rock album...
B00014K5TQ|5.0|What a great movie! I've been very interested in this story since I read a magazine article about it in the summer of 2003. I'm too young to remember when it all really happened (I was born in 86.) I agree with most people, my favorite parts were any ones that had Seth Green in them. He's a fantastic actor and I totally believed him in his role, but I have to say I loved Macaulay Culkin as Michael Alig also. I thought they had good chemistry on screen, I believed they could friends.<br />Good costumes, and great music, although admittedly not of the right era. I would suggest seeing this movie before reading the book so you can see it at least one time without saying \\"Oh where's Jennytalia? and Mavis? Where did Freeze come from?\\" <BR>I also loved the inclusion of some real club kids, like my favorite and yours, Richie Rich. Look for him in the movie, he's the cute blonde on roller skates when they're on the talk show.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|When I was first introduced to Sarah's music many years ago it seemed like it sounded all the same.  But because of the emotional ties to the track I listened over and over again and by the third spin I was picking up the differences.<br />The first time I listened to Afterglow I was distracted and it all sounded too similar. It isn't.  The cd is well put together: the songs are different in lyric, speed, and sound and flows from beginning to end.  I have found myself at the end of the cd without realizing how long I was listening. I have already used it as a lullaby cd when I couldn't fall to sleep.<br />It's one of my favorite cds although they all run close.  I couldn't choose a favorite track because they all grab me in one way or another.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone who asked.
B0000942FL|5.0|SONGS ABOUT JANE is a great album and the extra track on this import is  a GREAT SONG. It is a piano based ballad. However you can save a lot of money and get more for your money by simply buying the regular version of SONGS ABOUT JANE along with the HARDER TO BREATHE SINGLE.<br />The single includes RAGDOLL along with the video of HARDER TO BREATHE.<br />So for about 15 less dollars you can have all of the songs on this album plus the video of their first single by simply buying the American version of SONGS ABOUT JANE and the SINGLE for HARDER TO BREATHE

B00005JMJ4|3.0|I've been anticipating seeing this since I read about it in Rolling Stone months ago. My friends further whet my appetite by touting it's good qualities, and telling me what a wonderful movie it was. Perhaps I had built my expectations to dizzying heights, perhaps it was the influence of others that placed this movie head and shoulders above anything I'd see. In my mind, it was Citizen Kane, the pinnacle of indi-film. A life changing experience. <br />Needless to say, I was disappointed. Incredibly so. <br />This is not a bad movie, but its not a particularly good movie either. Sophia Coppola's debut is littered with montages that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, except to make this movie drag. Bill Murray is charming, as always, but something misses the mark. Perhaps its the fact the female lead (Scarlett Johansson) seems to have take acting lessons from Natalie Portman. By that, I mean all lines are delivered in a monotone, even when she's angered. The plot is almost non-existent, and there is very little in the way of astonishing sound or cinematography to salvage this one. <br />It does have its good points. There are some humorous interactions between Bill Murray and basically everyone. The problem is that these interactions are few and far between. Perhaps I've become entirely too jaded to buy into the melancholy of this movie, but I just found it lacking in anything resembling a human emotion. <br />I read somewhere that this compares to 'Harold and Maude.' I'd really suggest that you dig that one up at some point if you're considering checking 'Lost in Translation' out. It's a far superior film, without the hackneyed directing this one has. <br />Again, my expectations were built to dizzying heights, and I was severely let down by this movie. I don't think I'll give it a second chance though, simply because it took too long to develop. Check it out though, it's worth an hour and 40 minutes.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I am giving this CD one star only because there's not an option for no stars.<br />This album is horrible.  One of the previous reviewers wrote that &quot;this is the album Metallica should have done instead of St. Anger.&quot;  And sadly, I have to agree.<br />I first heard DT in the I&amp;W days.  When I got into them, I really got into them.  Such bright and brilliant music, such wonderful melodies, such heaviness mixed in with a touch of class, a touch of style, that had never been heard before in music.  I was so enamored with the music of dream theater -- I can't tell you how many times I sailed away in my mind by listening to &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; or &quot;Surrounded&quot; ...  Then Awake came out, and what a step up!  Boosting the heaviness a bit, leaning toward the post-prog jazz thing at times, but man, what a brilliant album!   And then consider &quot;A  Change of Seasons&quot; -- epic in its proportions.<br />And now this is what they come up with?  Granted, no band should stay in one place -- I didn't lose faith in this band when they came out with Falling Into Infinity and wanted to be Pink Floyd -- I found the beauty in such songs as &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; and &quot;Trial of Tears&quot; ... But Train of Thought is a new low.  A horrendous mistake that has been burned forever in my mind and is, in fact, the coupe de grace as it were that has killed my faith in DT's ability to write solid songs.<br />In 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulance, my faith was shaken a bit in Petrucci's ability to do more than play on the B and E strings.  You couldn't hear the bass if you tried, and there were fewer and fewer moments of brilliance.  Although there were some bright spots on that album, such as &quot;Misunderstood,&quot; and &quot;Solitary Shell.&quot;<br />Train of Thought is ridiculous.  It is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  It is like DT wants to be Slayer now or something.  Guys, you ain't Slayer!  There's already one Slayer out there -- ANDTHAT'S ONE TOO MANY!<br />Not to mention that the band has fallen into the use of profanity in their lyrics.   C'mon, guys -- have a little class and self-dignity, okay?  Having only listened to this album once, it is such a sad statement to make that I can pick out every thrash metal influence they stole from.  I can hear Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Testament ... all those thrash bands whose hayday was 1991.<br />Dream Theater, if you read this -- and I hope you do -- know that you produced such a God-awful album that a once considered life-long fan LITERALLY ripped up the cover and took a knife to your CD and threw it away.  That's right, you may have my 20 beans for purchasing that cruddy excuse for a CD, but you'll not get any more of my money.<br />I cannot express in words fit for civilized human beings how much I now detest you and what you stand for.  You take the gobs of talent you have and throw it away, trying in a desparate attempt to win more and more fans by appealing to the lowest common factor.  You rot.  You have been replaced -- Shadow Gallery's star is rising while yours is declining into the pathetic depths of the washed up has-beens you're becoming.<br />Petrucci -- I met you in 1998 and, as one of your biggest fans, called you one of the best guitarists in the world.  I take that back.  You WERE one of the best.  Now you seem to be having jam sessions with Kerry King or Kirk Hammett.<br />They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, therefore Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth, Testament, Heathen, Venom and whoever else you stole your riffs from for this album must be very proud.
0553212540|4.0|I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.<br />Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.<br />It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.<br />The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.<br />When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.<br />Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.<br />Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.<br />I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out.

B00006BTCA|5.0|It's so unfortunate what hype can do to a truly great band. It creates standards that no group can possibly rise to, and this is ultimately unfair to those making the music. Just look at the Strokes. Now, the Strokes are good, but they're not THAT good. They are not the messiahs of rock or &quot;the next Velvet Underground,&quot; (with the exception of Casablanca's unmatched Lou Reed impression vocals) they are just a couple of guys who make some great rock tunes. <BR>   Over the last 2 years, Interpol has fallen victim to this same unfortunate trend. Being on Spin's dreaded &quot;The next big thing!&quot; list is certainly offputting for most elitist music listeners (yes, i include myself in this category). At the same time, for those people lacking the musical background to be familiar with a band's influences, calling Interpol &quot;the new Joy Division&quot; can only encourage disappointed sneers of &quot;oh no! goth-rock!&quot;<BR>   That Interpol have made it this far is in itself an accomplishment, one that I can only attribute to their insane 2-year world tour and an unmatched dedication to this album and its songs. But in the end, all that really matters is how the record sounds.<BR>   To begin with, one HAS to listen to this album on its own terms. The group has a great, unique sound, and the only aspect that they really have in common with JD (and Ian Curtis in particular) is lead singer Paul Banks's overly dramatic, baratone vocals. However, in order to truly enjoy Interpol, you have to let all comparrisons go for the time being. <BR>   &quot;untitled&quot; starts the album off with with a slow, repetitive introduction that foreshadows the energy that will be shown later in the album. &quot;obstacle 1&quot; comes next, and it has become one of my favorites, with Kessler's fantastic guitar work and a poppy-but-dark rythm section. Other standouts include the (sigh)MTV award nominated &quot;PDA,&quot; the meloncoly &quot;Hands Away,&quot; &quot;Obstacle 1's&quot; younger, less developed brother &quot;obstacle 2,&quot; The dark, slowly building &quot;the new&quot; (my personal favorite), and the all-too-perfect concluding track &quot;leif erikson.&quot; <BR>   It takes a couple listens to unfold some of the more complex, darker songs like &quot;hands away&quot; and &quot;the new,&quot; but eventually you will begin to see the true genius and originality of this band. It grows on you, and you have to let it.<BR>   So does Interpol dissapoint? For me, this is the best album of 2002, and one of the most satisfying debuts i've ever heard. For everyone else, well i suppose you'll have to find out for yourself.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|... the album simply rocks. I could write a thousand-page review about it, drive the point home in a billion different ways, but why bother? London Calling is too amazing to warrent any verbal description, too creative to be spoken of in any conventional way. Just buy it. Believe me, you won't regret it.<br />Here's a little breakdown of the songs:<BR>1: London Calling- Possibly the best Clash song ever. Beneath the simple guitars and mumbled lyrics lie a complex work of genius. 10 out of 10<br />2: Brand New Cadillac- Tuneful, angry, wonderful. 10 out of 10.<br />3: Jimmy Jazz- Good, but it gets a bit monotonous. 8 out of 10<br />4: Hateful- See above. 8 out of 10.<br />5: Rudy Can't Fail- A ska number whose tune has grown more famous than its tune or origin. You'll almost definatley recognize this one, and I can guarintee you'll love it. The regge sound is executed perfectly, and Joe Strummer's angry way of singing adds a brilliant new dimension to the genre. 10 out of 10.<br />6: Spanish Bombs- A true jem. An acoustic and very melodic tune. I can't believe this one never became a hit. 10 out of 10.<br />7: The Right Profile- Good, but not their best. 7 out of 10.<br />8: Lost in the Supermarket- This track foreshadows Sandinista, a record in which the Clash frequently dabble in disco. \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" is one of the more experimental tracks on this album. Its a disco song, with a bit of pop mixed in. I never liked either style much, but somehow, the Clash made it sound inexplicably good. 8 out of 10.<br />9: Clampdown- \\"Workin' for the clampdown!\\" Great line, great song. \\"Clampdown\\" is a brilliantly satirical nuber, with a popish tune. Not their best song, but by no means bad. 10 out of 10.<br />10: Guns of Brixton- WOW. An amazing song, from start to finnish. Its a regge song, loaded down with a powerful bass (and why not, it WAS written by their bass player). The lyrics are some of the best on the record. 10 out of 10.<br />11: Wrong 'Em Boyo- Blah. 5 out of 10.<br />12: Death or Glory- is that... 80's new wave? And in the seventies? Woah. Great song. 9 out of 10.<br />13: Kola Kola- Short, speedy, punk. 10 out of 10.<br />14: The Card Cheat- A bit slow at first, but one it speeds up, its really something. Its more of the Clash's Brittish punk heritage, with some of the most meaningful lyrics on the album. Powerful stuff. 9 out of 10.<br />15: Lover's Rock- It's like something off a Beach Boys record. That is, the Beach Boys if they DIDN'T suck. The song is slower than the others, but very melodic, with a nice little guitar solo to boot. 8 out of 10.<br />16: Four Horesemen- Another return to the Clash's punk origins. A good song, but with too many stops and starts. 8 out of 10.<br />17: I'm Not Down- A great working class rock song. 7 out of 10.<br />18: Revolution Rock- Great title, O.K. song. Another stab at ska that sounds really good... until it gets monotonous. I love the line \\"Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this brand new beat.\\" The ska tune is perfect, with just a bit of the Clash's trademark punk style to keep it fresh, but its just TOO LONG. A guy gets bored. 7 out of 10.<br />19: Train in Vain- More disco. This is a pretty big hit of theirs, but its not that great a song. 6 out of 10.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|If I could have the 2 hours back I spent watching this movie, I would rather have spent my time licking my own ass or get beat over the head with a baseball bat!  It was Long, Drawn out, and boring.  Not once did I attempt to laugh, it would have hurt too much.  The &quot;Artiness&quot; of the movie was nonexistent.  It was crude toward Japan.  Mocking them many times and showed them as boring and crazy.  I would recommend that you take a boxing glove put it on and pound your head before you glance at this movie!
B00005JGAB|5.0|... the words that inspired a revolution. Yeah, I know that phrase has been repeated so many times it would be stale to title a review with, but it's such a perfect way to summerize the Ramones. They were so full of energy, so powerful and vibrant in everything they did, and this record represents that perfectly. They never let up, from the opening attack of &quot;Blitzkreig Bop&quot; to the energetic closing bars of &quot;Today your love, Tomorrow the world.&quot;<BR>       The record sounds more like a best of collection, with classics like &quot;Judy is a punk&quot; and the blatantly titled &quot;Now I wanna sniff some glue.&quot; (That is probably the greatest song title ever, next to NOFX's &quot;I Live In a Cake&quot;).<BR>       But don't take my word for it. These guys have been showered in praise all over the musical world, and I'm just one more bleating voice in the endless flock that eternally screams the greatness of the Ramones. But I'll tell you, the flock is right. The Ramones simply rock.

0375707972|5.0|It is much easier to write a scathing review than to be humbled in the face of what for me is, to date, the best book that I have ever read.  THE READER By Bernard Schlink is only one of ten books that I have already read this year and though I have recommended it to others no one has had quite the irreversible effect from its reading that I did.  I finished it awhile ago and yet there is not a detail that I don't still recall.  I am not often up for a second reading of anything except WUTHERING HEIGHTS and yet I can hardly wait for the third copy I have purchased and loaned to be returned so that I can read it again.  I am so afraid that I may have missed something in my first and second reading.<BR>    The reviews on this novel are honest and for me they spell out clearly why it meets so precisely my criteria for the near perfect story.  Schlink never uses an extra word, never describes an event not absolutely essential to the story, never wastes or neglects a minute of your time.  Truely, this is a story for the ages.<BR>    For weeks after reading about the middle-aged woman who would rather be exposed for an ex-Nazi guard than be found out to be uneducated in post-war Germany,I could only debate the decision of her former lover not to help her at her trial.  I kept remembering how he had once loved her and how he had failed,in the course of his life, to find a relationship as important to him as the one he had had with her.  I debated his choice with a vehemence I rarely feel, for any characters in a novel; afterall, it is once and for all only fiction, correct?<BR>I was truely sorry to finish this book; it is unfortunately, a very quick read.  Though it needed to be no longer in length, it was a genuine loss when it was finished and a story that I am still dizzy from. <BR>This is a very small investment with a king sized reward!

Smith certainly isn't afraid to stir such minor topics as race, colonialism, class, gender, culture, religion, fate, sexuality, history and science into her melting pot examination of identity, and as such, it's one of those books whose plot cannot be succinctly outlined. In the broadest possible terms, the book revolves around Archie and Samad, an Englishman and Bangladeshi respectively, who are in the same tank unit in World War II. After spending a goodly chunk of time on their wartime experience, the book covers both the next 45 years of their lives (lengthy stops are made in the late '60s, '70s, and '80s), and with the past (flashbacks are made to mid-19th century India and Jamaica). The true protagonists are Archie's daughter Irie, and Samad's twin sons, Millat and Majid. And the central theme of the book is their struggle for identity, which is sometimes unconscious and sometimes very purposeful.<br />One of the book's main flaws is that in addition to these five major characters, there are the mothers of each, and a veritable wagonload of important supporting characters, including a third family that appears well into the book. There's a lot of coming and going and coming, and on and on as characters assume central importance for ten pages, only to disappear for two-hundred. Smith is trying to weave a very complicated web (many critics call this aspect of the book &quot;Dickensian&quot;), but in doing so, the transitions become awfully jarring, and very often, annoying. A second major issue is that the characters are all types of one sort or another. Smith sets them in motion in order to comment on her grab-bag of issues, but never quite gives them enough individuality or humanity. The good thing is that she does manage to create a unique voice for each . Like Martin Amis, she's has an excellent ear for the rhythms of conversation and the specific vernaculars of both time and group. Similarly, she likes to play with language in a way that is both refreshing and assured.<br />On the whole, I liked this book-albeit grudgingly. Smith has taken a kind of &quot;throw everything except the kitchen sink at the wall and see what sticks&quot; approach, leaving no major issue unturned in her attempt to leave her mark on the reader. This means that a lot of the threads never lead anywhere, and thus the overall effect is not as strong as she might have intended. A good editor might have been able to pare some elements back a bit, allowing others to blossom more. Similarly, an editor ought to have helped with some of the many inaccuracies that crop up (two random examples: some of the portrayal of the Jehovah's Witnesses is factually incorrect, as are some of the details of Ryan's scooter). Still, as a portrait of multicultural London over the years and how the concept of &quot;being British&quot; has evolved in that time, it works quite well. And its questions about identity and belonging are applicable to immigrants coming to any Western country. The book was made into a 4-hour BBC miniseries, which has still never been released on video.aculars of both time and group.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|First off, let me say that this movie is NOT a comedy.  Admittedly, it has its funny (and sometimes hysterical) moments, but it's not a kind of light-hearted film you watch to pick yourself up.<br />Secondly, this movie certainly has a lot of hype (that's how I ended up seeing it), but it doesn't live up to it (and no movie ever does, as another reviewer pointed out).  If you've got some gargantuan expectations about this film, you should rent before you buy.<br />That's not to say the movie is bad, though.  In fact, this is probably one of the greatest films I've seen in my life.  I admit, when I first saw it, it was certainly not what I was expecting.  It's very slowly-paced, it's not your typical, straight-forward narrative, and the location (Tokyo) of the film threw me off as well.  But what counts here are the characters and their development throughout the film.  I usually don't like Bill Murray (a little too slap-stick for me), but this truly is one of his best performances (that I've seen), for he's so subtle and toned down from the whacky guy so many people are used to, but that adds an enormous amount of depth to the film.  He manages to convey so much with simple expressions and mannerisms alone.<br />And Scarlett Johansson is also wonderful playing a soul-searching, borderline-apathetic/jaded young wife discovering the real world and opening her eyes to, and truly looking at her own life for the very first time.  Her chemistry with Bill Murray is unmatched.  Less than halfway through the movie, I fell in love with both chracters and really cared about them by the end.<br />The soundtrack is also incredible.  If you're in the mood for a quiet movie that'll make you think a little (about yourself and your own life, not in terms of plot), definitely check this out.  As another reviewer stated, it really DOES get better each time you watch it!
B000002KKD|5.0|It's hard to believe that this debut album was unleashed a quarter of a century ago; nobody has come close to duplicating what The B-52's accomplished upon its release.  Raw, energetic and charmingly naive, this one's about the basics of rock and roll: singing your heart out, dancing yourself into a frenzy, and celebrating youth.<br />There are a handful of B-52's anthologies on the market, but their late-blooming commercial success detracts from the brilliance of their debut.  There isn't a weak track among the bunch.  Beginning with the bizarre &quot;Planet Claire,&quot; the listener goes on a wild journey that is steeped in the culture of 1950s science fiction movies, beehive hairdos, dance crazes, and joyful irreverence.<br />Musically, the band adopts much of the punk &quot;do it yourself&quot; attitude that prevailed during the time of the album's release.  Bass guitars seem to fixate on one chord, rhythm guitars run up and down scales, and basic drum beats push the songs forward.  Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson's voices, which at first blush seem so wildly out of tune, blend in a manner that is sublimely beautiful.  Fred Schneider's vocals, which recall Rex Harrison's talk/singing in the film version of &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; seem so natural in this setting that it's easy to find yourself singing along with him at any point.<br />Lyrically, the band explores territory that few have ever chanced.  Name-checking Tina Louise and Jackie Onassis in &quot;52 Girls&quot; is unique to say the least, and including a reference to limburger cheese in a list of dances (&quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot;) is a route that was never evident to Burt Bacharach.  By the time you reach the closer, a left-field cover of Petula Clark's &quot;Downtown,&quot; you get the feeling that anything is possible from this band, and the further out they drift, the more you want to go along for the ride.<br />Of course, this isn't going to appeal to everyone.  Indeed, the band didn't findwidespread acceptance for another ten years after this album's release.  However, if you're in the mood for something that's fun, not top-heavy, and ultra-groovy--or, if you've ever stood in front of your mirror and wondered what it would be like to be a rock star without having to play by someone else's rules--this is one you shouldn't miss.
B0000025ZF|3.0|I was kind of dissapointed after listening this album. Not bad, but, not able to compete with previous PF albums like The Wall and Final Cut. <BR>I listen the music first, then I pay attention to the lyrics. In this case, the music did not appeal too much to me. It is excesively repetitive. Clapton's guitar was, of course, a good &quot;replacement&quot; for Gilmour, playing masterfully throughout the album. Unfortunatelly, he did not fit very well in the album sound (or the other way around). The rest of the band was only OK, nothing outstanding. <BR>And the lyrics, the story? I don't really care too much, I can read it without listening the album.<BR>The only tracks than can save this album are Every Strangers Eyes and The Moment of Clarity. That's all. Then, after some years, Waters really made it with his masterpiece Amused to death and In the Flesh. <BR>Supossedly, this was a second project that Waters had along with the Wall. I'm glad the band decided for the latter, because The Pros and Cons was not going to become the megaclassic as The Wall is now.<BR>In my opinion, I don't think the are good reasons to buy this album, unless you are collectionist of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters albums.
B000088E6D|4.0|Taken at face value, this particular CD doesn't look as if it would be promising.  The world already has an accomplished good-looking jazz/big band singer with an affinity for standards (Harry Connick Jr., anyone?), and Harry seems to have cornered the market on that particular genre.  Factor in Buble's choice of cover songs, which are all fairly familiar, and this could have been a sonic disaster.  However, that is most certainly not the case with Michael Buble's debut album.  This particular outing succeeds for a variety of reasons, not the least of which include the singer's sincere delivery and a handful of very interesting remakes.<br />Buble first gained my attention sharing vocals with Holly Palmer on the spunky title song from the movie &quot;Down With Love.&quot;  After investigating that soundtrack, which includes two of the songs included on this album (George Michael's &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot; and the Motown chestnut &quot;For Once In My Life&quot;), Buble won me over simply because he truly does seem connected to what he's singing--he's not just phoning the vocals in.<br />The album opens with Peggy Lee's &quot;Fever,&quot; and while it may not be a great idea to lead off with another singer's signature tune, he does do right by the song.  Where Lee's vocals were deliciously flippant, Buble adds some urgency as the song draws to a close, which does serve the song well.  &quot;Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot; don't really stray much from the originals, but there again, Buble's earnestness is what raises each cut above a star turn on a fund-raising telethon.<br />However, Buble hits pay dirt more often than not.  His reworking of Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; trades the original's rockabilly stylings for a Glenn Miller-era brass sound, and it works.  (One could argue that much of the success of this version rests on Freddie Mercury's songwriting prowess, but Buble does pull off a radical reworking that may not have been clearly evident at first.)  &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; includes backing vocals from one of the original artists, Barry Gibb.  And his take on Van Morrison's &quot;Moondance&quot; is an absolute stunner.  He is able to convey the longing and desire of Morrison's version with a lush arrangement (courtesy of David Foster) that takes the song to an entirely different level.  &quot;Moondance&quot; alone makes the CD worth the price paid.<br />It will be interesting to see where Buble goes from here.  This is a solid debut, and while there are a few less-than-inspired outings, it doesn't derail the entire project.  The Latin-tinged performance on &quot;Sway&quot; is very promising, and it would be interesting to see what he could do if he moved more into that direction or traded some of the too-often covered standards (&quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; immediately comes to mind) for a few early rock and roll classics--something along the lines of &quot;Sea Of Love&quot; or &quot;Hello, Mary Lou.&quot;  This truly is a fine album, but Buble's talent lends me to believe that he's capable of something spectacular, and with a little luck, he'll be delivering it very soon.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is by far the best version of Peter Pan. P.J. Hogan has done a wonderful job by creating a spectacular, mystical, and entrancing movie. This is not only for a younger audience, but for adults also! This is an unforgetable movie that should be watched by all. Don't miss out on this BRILLIANT movie!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I generally don't write reviews for albums, however the nature of the majority of the criticism I've read for this release is absolutely ridiculous, so I feel obligated to throw in my two cents here. <br />Somehow, it seems as though APC would need to release abrasive, Tool-esque material in order to capture the enthusiasm of a lot of Tool fans. Far too many of the reviews I've read argue &quot;This album is too soft ... I can't believe what's happened to Maynard ... etc, etc.&quot; Is there a standard sound that a metal album has to achieve in order to earn respect? Can a metal album not be even remotely mellow these days? If you're one of those people who judged this album based on how good it sounded when you cranked it up in your car stereo, please be advised that you've written a terribly deficient critique, and probably lack the required intelligence and insight to even remotely identify a few of the elements that comprise an excellent piece of music. Do your homework before you write another review please, and save the rest of us a small segment of our lives. Oh, and I hope you're all not listening to Tool because it is loud music that gets your puerile, prepubescent minds all riled up.<br />As for the album, it does have some weak points, however it still earns my 5 stars. I'd have given it 4 stars, but what really convinced me that this is a superb piece of work is that it is totally different in comparison to Mer De Noms. The greatest bands are capable of expressing themselves with different approaches to their music, and APC is no exception.<br />Maynard comes through again lyrically, as expected. What makes APC, Tool (and many other bands great) is the combination of lyrical depth and a cohesive, instrumental sound. Love or hate Maynard (I for one, do not agree with much of what he seems to imply), you cannot deny him the respect he deserves for being able to captivate your attention with the philosophies conveyed in his music. The *presentation* of histhoughts through his music is absolutely priceless work.<br />Yes, the album is mellow in comparison to the typical metal production. However, if you can appreciate strong lyrics and an excellent band supporting them, Thirteenth Step is worth a purchase.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I am a recent convert to Yes.  I am not a lifelong fan and will be seing them for the 1st time this May.  I own most of their other albums, and bought TFTO primarily because I wanted to see what the controversy was about.  I am blown away by the musicianship and complexity of this.  You'll get lost in this music. I personally think this is Yes at their best.
B00008MNYS|4.0|I can honestly say this is one of the best cds that I have ever heard in my life. 98% of the songs are excellent and very pleasant to listen to. This is the first time I have bought a cd from robbie williams and am planning to get some of his other stuff. Anyone who likes good pop music should get it.
0385510438|2.0|I am a huge fan of John Grisham, have read all of his books, but I have to admit, I have been disappointed with his last few books and The Last Juror takes the cake in that department.  It has a great plot, but Mr. Grisham goes no where with it.  It starts off very strong, but half way through and all the way to the end, it is awful.  I found myself skimming through the pages asking myself &quot;what in the world does this have to do with the story?&quot;.  Any Grisham fan out there should read it just to read it, but do not expect anything that Grisham's potential has to offer.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|This disc disappointed me.  There is nothing new here.  It's not that it's too heavy for my tastes, it's just that I was expecting better after 6 degrees.  There is none of the strong melodic themes that made DT almost unique in the metal world, none of the complex song structures that made DT different.  Anyone looking at DT from a prog angle is well advised to stay clear of this one.  Yes the technical ability of the musicians is awe inspiring (particularily the very talented Mike Portnoy), but their songwriting skills abandoned them this time.  If I wanted Metallica, I would buy Metallica.  And don't get me wrong, I do own and listen to Metallica from time to time, but when I slip a DT disc in the player, I am expecting more, and Train of Thought didn't give it to me.
B000127LW2|5.0|Watching Voyager is like reading The Lord of The Ring's, it's good for my heart, encourages me to be a man that stands for something.  Plus watching the doctor shrink in the 2nd episode was (after having watched the series on T.V.), hilarious.  Thank you to the &quot;God's&quot; for finally putting this on DVD.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I had access to this soundtrack prior to viewing the movie. It is moving, riveting, and soulful. I can almost envision the elements that each title represents. My husband has listened to it nonstop while at work for the past 2 days and has come home with a totally different attitude. <BR>I highly recommend this especially as background music to listen to while meditating on Sacred Scripture. (Not too loud, just softly in the background.)

B00011RPB0|1.0|I hated the movie, of course.  My point, however, is that as an Australian in Germany I must point out that I am very quick to let people know that despite my English speaking accent, I am not American.  Not because I hate Americans - I only hate American foreign policy and economic exploitation.  The reason I make it clear I am not American is because most people in Europe really dislike America and Americans (Germany is not especially notable for this - it is more universal).  This movie presents the stereotypical (exorbitant, culturally disrespectful and insular, lazy, self important) stereotype in all of it's hideous glory.  To those Americans that swallow the crap fed to them on the media, try to watch this movie from the Japanese perspective.  Sofia Coppola should be ashamed.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' in the Rain was always one of my favourites, so I jumped at the chance on buying the Special Edition DVD. The special features on Disc 2 are fabulous -- the best I have seen yet. It was when I watched the &quot;Musicals, Great Musicals!&quot; featurette on disc 2 that I got a surprise! You see, I am a HUGE Judy Garland fan! Clips from her old movies take up at least 30 minutes of the 90 minute featurette. So not only will Singin' in the Rain fans get their fill, Garland fans will too.<BR>The dancing and musical numbers in this film are astounding. In my opinion, talent like this doesn't exist anymore in todays society.<BR>This DVD is highly recommended. You are guaranteed to LOVE IT! <br />***Look out for &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; starring Gene Kelly and Judy Garland coming out on DVD in April!
0446310786|5.0|After reading this book I find it completely reasonable that Harper Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and several other prizes, and that librarians across the United States have selected this book as the best novel of the twentieth century. It is also understandable that Harper Lee did not write any other novel after this one; she had already created a perfect one and there was no real room to improve! The aspect I loved most about this book is how it shows that when children are allowed to think by themselves, without being prejudiced by the opinion of the adults, they see everything crystal clear.<br />Lee has created a literary masterpiece with so many remarkable aspects that one feels threatened to comment on them for fear of leaving out important ones; I will try nonetheless to point out at least a couple of them. The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, who is the one telling the story. She is a little girl whose father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The main lesson the book disseminates and the one that is easiest to grasp is that racism is destructive and has no reason to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. Even nowadays, we have a long way to go towards accepting that someone's skin color is completely irrelevant. Although this problem has been reduced considerably other forms of discrimination still exist and should be eradicated.<br />It is uplifting to see a father like Atticus Finch, who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values. Jem describes this perfectly: &quot;Atticus is a gentleman, just like me&quot;.<br />I can understand why this book has been selected as part of the required readings in high school, and also why a lot of kids, finding it difficult to read, do not particularly enjoy it. To those of you that have a bitter recollection of this book and are now adults, I urge you to reread it and I guarantee that you will see clearly that it was worth it. If you are reading the book for high school, try to understand what the society was like in 1960 and you will enjoy this chore a lot more. Finally, I just have to say that I feel privileged for having read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, even though nobody ever forced me to do so.stand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear.

Capitalism is indeed Freedom and Freedom is itself repeated, therefore Capitalism is as such the multiple of the same.

0446677450|2.0|I would rate this book with two and a half stars if I could vote in half star increments.  The book has a lot of positive aspects, but it has a lot of non-specific advice and some very bad or inaccurate advice.<br />Understand that this is not a book that will give you the \\"How To\\" on anything. The author leaves out most of the specific details that would allow someone to create a plan.  The book is very much a \\"Financial Philosophy\\" book.<br />The postive aspects is the author's hard hitting advice in the beginning of the book.  He spends time talking about how the educational system doesn't really teach people how to managage money effectively.  He also discusses some great points on how you should invest your money in income producing assets like rental real estate, stocks, businesses, etc.  He gives some great advice on how a person needs to avoid buying liabilities.  He defines liabilities as anything that doesn't produce income and actually costs you money to keep like a boats, cars, etc.  He points out that we are taught to get good grades, get a good job, and buy the American dream.  He points out that most people buy things using consumer debt and spend their whole life working hard to pay bankers, interest on credit cards, etc.  He says we are taught that our future is in a \\"secure\\" job, which he contends doesn't exist.  In my opinion all of this is excellent advice and goes a long way to getting people to rethink their views on their financial lives.  It isn't really specific on any points here, but if you are a person who puts faith in a secure job, spends most of your income, and has consumer debt you may get a real eye opener by reading the book.<br />On the negative side he doesn't give you any specific plans, steps, outlines, or information on \\"how to\\" build income producing assets.  He has a few very vague examples of things he has done, but nothing specific.  He does however offer up some very bad tax advice about how to use corporations and 1031 real estate exchanges.  I would strongly recommend a reader go see their personal attorney and CPA before trying any of his suggestions on tax.  He also seems to come down pretty hard on any type of formal education.  He repeats over and over again how bad our educational system is.  While I think he has a point that our educational system doesn't teach people how to manage money effectively I completely disagree that education is worthless.  A good education in math, English, writing, and business etc. will never be a waste no matter what your lot in life is.  He also spends  time basically directing readers to other sources for specific information on how to do anything.  He suggests readers attend seminars, read other books, play his game CASHFLOW, etc. to get specific education on topics such as investing, real estate, taxes, etc.  Finally, he has some very bad and vague examples of how taxes work in different scenarios, which I found inaccurate.<br />The overall writing style could also use improvement.  His style of writing is vague at points, illogical, and poorly constructed.  He points out in the book that he is a \\"best selling\\" not a \\"best writing\\" author.  I would agree with that.<br />I don't want to bash the book too bad because I can see what he was trying to accomplish, but to a beginner or someone who doesn't have a business background you could easily draw bad conclusions and bad advice from the book.  I would recommend a person only read it as a broad overall introduction to \\"financial thinking\\" and avoid all general advice he gives on taxes, education, or investing.  I would read other far better books on those subjects.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer's Reign In Blood is the greatest album to ever grace the planet Earth. It's a complete masterpiece. It starts off with Angel Of Death, which is the greatest song ever written. It's a masive onslaught of cryptic lyrics and I love it. The guitar riffs are amazing. Most of the metal today could be played by monkeys. This is truely an amazing album. Raining Blood is another example of a masterpiece song. The riff after the sound of the blood rain is AMAZING! You should buy the album just to hear that.
630179513X|4.0|A film by Robert Zemeckis<br />\\"Back to the Future Part III\\" is the third and concluding chapter to the \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy.  For many years this was my least favorite film in the trilogy, but watching it again for the first time in years I have new appreciation for it.  \\"Back to the Future Part III\\" is a satisfying and worthy end to this trilogy.<br />At the end of the second movie the DeLorean is struck by lightening (which we already know provides the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of energy required for time travel) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is sent somewhen in time.  Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 Hill Valley, but just after Doc and the DeLorean disappears a letter arrives for Marty.  The letter is from Doc and was written in 1885.  It was left as the post office with the instructions to be delivered on that particular date at that particular time.  The letter says that Doc is alive and well in 1885 and under no circumstances is Marty to try to go back and rescue him.<br />Marty returns to the 1955 Doc Brown and enlists his help to recover the DeLorean which was left in a cave for 70 years.  While recovering the DeLorean Marty discovers a tombstone with Doc's name on it...and the date that Doc died was only a week after he wrote the letter!  The tombstone reads \\"shot in the back by Buford Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) over a matter of $80\\".  There is no way Marty is going to let this happen, so he puts gas in the DeLorean and travels back in time to 1885 to help Doc.  Of course, if it was that simple, we wouldn't have much of a movie, so complications evolve.  The DeLorean ruptures its gas line, so that it leaks gas and can no longer be driven under its own power.  Part of the movie is Doc and Marty trying to get the DeLorean back up to 88 miles per hour, but there is also the matter of Buford \\"Mad Dog\\" Tannen who still intends to shoot Doc over that matter of eighty dollars...or will history change and will Marty's name on that tombstone?  This final installment also introduces a love interest for Doc Brown in the person of Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), the new school teacher with an interest in science.<br />This movie is much more of a straight forward action/adventure/comedy (whatever) movie.  The time travel serves to get Marty in the past and back to the present, but there isn't as much playing around with time travel as there is in the second movie.  I still think this might be the weakest of the movies, but it is a very fun ride.  While this movie will never reach the \\"classic\\" status that I feel the first one will, this is a very enjoyable movie and is a fitting end to the trilogy.  Good stuff.final installment also introduces a love interest for Doc Brown in the person of Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), the new school teacher with an interest in science.  <br />This movie is much more of a straight forward action/adventure/comedy (whatever) movie.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Cleese is such a talent.  Taken from an actual hotel that he stayed in with a segment on this DVD which talks about the owner whose character kind of shaped this series.<br />The acting and writing are superb, of course led by the central charater of Fawlty and his wife. But accompanying them and making it all one big hilarious synergy of rollicking, sidehurting laughter are the supporting cast, especially the Spanish waiter, bellboy, et al &quot;Manuel.&quot;  They all combine for great delights to treasure the laughter.<br />The &quot;under the breath&quot; comments of Fawlty about his wife, customers, etc. make it a true classic.<br />I totally agree with one reviewer's desire though: let's have a Fawlty Towers movie!  Begin the petition drive!
B0001ADB8C|5.0|I am so pleased that this box set has finally come out- however sadly after George's passing. This box set is what me &amp; my friends  have been waiting for- finally all of his albums that haven't been in the stores for 10+years.<br />It's so good to have great albums like &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, &quot;Somewhere In England&quot; &amp; &quot;George Harrison&quot; back in my collection---and remastered.<br />The DVD is excellent with so many great bonus features like &quot;Someplace Else&quot; &amp; the &quot;Live In Japan&quot; section...<br />The artwork is also quite good &amp; I really enjoyed the history on Dark Horse Records from Olivia Harrison in the booklet.<br />This box set is definitely worth the $125!!!!<br />Thanks for continuing to put out George's music!!!!!! Don't stop!!!!!!!!!!!

0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is a great suspense novel!!  It was hard to put down.  However, as to the validity of the ideas in the book, I have many doubts.  His &quot;research&quot;, using other books as sources, was extensive. Did he do any of his own ORIGINAL research?  Did he try to verify the findings in these other books?  It seems today that anyone can get anything published.  Just because something is in a book, it DOES NOT mean it is true.  The book states &quot;The Bible is a product of man. ... and it has evolved through countless translations, additions, and revisions.  History has never had a definitive version of the book.&quot; (p. 231).  The &quot;secret documents&quot; guarded by the Priory of Sion were also written by men, and therefore were were most likely influenced by the writters' political and religous beliefs.<br />Take the book for what it is a fun and exciting adventure.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|When this superb and ingenius album was about to be released,the word was that in time it would become the biggest selling album ever... well,its on its way to becoming just that! Anybody who doesn't love this album needs a lobotomy,and right away!!!
0385508476|4.0|This book has everything you could need or want to know about Anne Frank. Unlike other versions of The Diary of Anne Frank, this book has three different versions of how the diary was translated. The first 150 pages or so are actual pictures of the diary, pictures of her family,a detail story of the Heinrich family's life and analyzation of her handwriting. The book is extremely detailed there for, it is not a book to read if you want to do easy reading and can get boring if you are not really interested in the life of Anne Frank.
B000003S09|5.0|Hearing passing things from KIng Crimson for a long time now, I've only recently had the joy of hearing one of their albums from start to finish. All the songs are great, and are a good combination of all the different elements you can hear in music. Well, atleast to a certain degree, I mean, they're no John Zorn or Mr. Bungle (Most of the so-called Crimhead poseurs who will pass by this site probably don't even know who those two artists are). I share some disagreements however. I wish people would stop dissing &quot;Moonchild&quot;, obviously the people dissing are pretentious individuals who have biast and limited views of music (and therefore don't now what they're talking about), but what do you expect with a band as popular as KIng Crimson? THey obviously don't have a concept of chance music, minimalism, space jazz/free jazz, or noise art. The end of &quot;Moonchild&quot; is more than likely meant to envoke the more random, spontaneous elements of life and mind. Imagine an alleyway or a dark meadow where little elves are popping out of trashcans to shoot vampire bats with their magical beebee guns, or any number of incredibly bizzare ambient images from the imagination, and you may be able to appreciate it more. It's not pointless, it's just misunderstood. If this concept makes little sense to you, which I'm sure it does, then you should be able to atleast have a sense of humour and not take things so seriously. For all we know, they could've learned those seemingly random sounding notes. If they didn't, who cares? I think it's good that a band can offer contradictions in their music. Some of the songs are fast and insane, others somnambulant and pretty, and I surmise that the end of &quot;Moonchild&quot; was intentionally thrown in to add an element of confusion and unseriousness to the mix. In any case, I like it, so stop complaining and learn more about music for once. And oh yeah, &quot;Epitaph&quot; is good, but way overrated. It sounds alot like PInk Floyd, go figure, they're only probably the most popular and overrated psychadelic rock band in history. All the songs are grade A. I'd like to hear Sonic Youth do a rendition of &quot;Moonchild&quot;.

B00009Z574|3.0|Tormato has a reputation as one of the worst Yes albums, but if you ask individual Yes fans their opinion of it, they're likely to say it's not that bad.<br />And it's not.  \\"Don't Kill The Whale,\\" \\"Release, Release,\\" and \\"Onward\\" are all very good songs.  And \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom\\" is pretty much the epitome of \\"classic Yes.\\"<br />But unfortunately, there's also some really bad stuff here.  The ear-grating \\"Madrigal\\" is Yes self-parody that is mercifully short, \\"Arriving UFO\\" is just plain weird (and not in a good way), and of course, there's the infamous \\"Circus Of Heaven,\\" heavyweight contender for the title of \\"Worst Yes Song Ever.\\"<br />Another weak point is Rick Wakeman's shrill keyboards.  Why on earth he went for this sound is beyond me- it sounds like a combination of a string section and Alvin and the Chipmunks.<br />But the good far outweighs the bad on Tormato.  \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\" has some pretty cheesy lyrics, but it rocks hard and is enjoyable.  \\"Release, Release\\" is a tongue-in-cheek rocker with some great vocal performances, along with an Alan White drum solo (!) and an Asia-ready solo from guitarist Steve Howe.  \\"Onward\\" is a simple, mellow love ballad that sounds oddly out of place here.  \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom,\\" however, is the reason to purchase Tormato if you don't have it.  Squire and White are an incredible rhythm section, and no song better exemplifies that than \\"Freedom.\\"  Jon Anderson gives a great vocal on the song as well.<br />And the bonus tracks?  Well, there's not much to get excited about, unlike some of the Rhino Yes remasters.  \\"Abilene\\" is as good as it gets, although it would sound much better as an instrumental.  \\"Picasso\\" is a forgettable sequel to \\"Turn Of The Century,\\" and \\"Money\\" will give you a chuckle but not much else.  The a capella Jon Anderson demo \\"Days\\" is noteworthy, though, as is \\"Everybody's Song,\\" an early version of \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" (it sounds very weird to hear Anderson sing lines from that song).  There is also an unlisted, \\"hidden\\" 18th track, a beautiful orchestral rendition of \\"Onward.\\"<br />In the context of the masterpieces it comes between (1977's Going For The One and 1980's Drama), Tormato is indeed a disappointment, but taken on its own it's pretty good.  Definitely worth a purchase for those on the fence about it.es from that song).

B00005JMJ4|1.0|This has got to be Bill Murray's worst film ever and amazingly he may win an Oscar for it!!  It is like Alex Rodriguez winning MVP in a year he spend on the disabled list.
B00009Z576|5.0|I really pity those who don't like this album.  If you look past Jon Anderson's absence, you're left with one of the greatest albums in not only the history of Yes, but also the history of rock music in general.<br />Actually, you don't even have to look past Anderson's absence.  The Buggles' Trevor Horn has a voice that fits perfectly into this musical universe (of course, Chris Squire's familiar harmony vocals help a lot).  Listen to the extended a capella section of \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" if you don't believe me.  In fact, that's one of the best things about Drama- after the first three minutes or so of the opener \\"Machine Messiah,\\" you'll forget about Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman.  Geoff Downes sounds a lot like Wakeman on keyboards, only a bit more restrained.  The organs and synthesizers he uses on \\"Messiah\\" add a lot of flavor to this heavy-metal styled track.<br />Well, that takes care of the two new factors.  But how do Squire, Steve Howe, and Alan White fare here?  Fantastically.  This is Squire's best effort with Yes by a long shot.  His bass solo intros to \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" and \\"Into The Lens\\" are crisp, clear, and masterfully done.  And of course, the legendary bassline from \\"Tempus Fugit\\" will knock your socks off.  Alan White makes one of his most powerful contributions as well; \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" has a simple yet magnificent beat.  Also of note on that song is Steve Howe's rippin' steel guitar, which is pretty startling the first time you hear it.  Howe's swift fingers are all over \\"Tempus Fugit\\" as well, and his soulful and bluesy noodlings on \\"Into The Lens\\" are great.<br />As if you couldn't tell by now, \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" is my favorite song on Drama.  But really, every track stands out, only the minute-and-a-half \\"White Car\\" is less than spectacular.<br />And of course, there's the bonus tracks- a whopping ten of them.  \\"Have We Really Got To Go Through This\\" and \\"Song #4 (Satellite),\\" two instrumentals Squire, Howe and White recorded after Anderson and Wakeman quit but before Horn and Downes came aboard, are incredible \\"power trio\\" rockers.  Some of the infamous \\"Paris Sessions\\" songs appear here as well, which include Anderson and Wakeman.  They're not nearly as bad as they're made out to be- in fact, they're mostly very good, especially \\"Golden Age.\\"<br />In short, anyone who has reservations about this album needn't worry.  And anyone who has already passed judgement on Drama should listen again with an open mind.<br />Yes, yes!te recorded after Anderson and Wakeman quit but before Horn and Downes came aboard, are incredible \\"power trio\\" rockers.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|All you have to do is read the review from LAURIE C. from Shelby Twp, MI USA in which she seems to equate proper movie viewing with intellectual ability.  She feels that those who did not like this film are of a lower intelligence then she is.  This review pretty much sums up those that have given this movie 5 stars.  They are individuals so insecure about their own intelligence that they need to attack others intelligence because of a difference in opinion on a film.  How sad someone needs to use a script written by a twenty something, nepotism enhanced, never worked a day in her life, rich young woman to justify how smart she herself is.  I reccomend Laurie just take an IQ test if she really wants to know how smart she is.  Movies are for entertainment, not spiritual enlightenment..unless of course if you seriously lack anything else to look forward to in your life other than sitting infront of a screen watching millionaires act depressed for 2 hours.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Cannibal Corpse ... is an introduction really necessary?  Well, for starters, Cannibal Corpse perform technical, brutal Death Metal straight from America.  Making use of complex riffing, tempo-changes and sheer brutality, Cannibal Corpse have come up with a truly successful formula.  The Wretched Spawn, Cannibal Corpse's latest offering is definitely what I consider to be their best recording yet.<br />Starting off with the very Thrash-inspired Severed Head Stoning, it's clear that Cannibal Corpse have mastered the art of Death Metal as well as flawless production.  The guitar, drums, vocals and even bass all shine through on this recording not having one particular instrument over-shadow the rest.<br />The Wretched Spawn actually shows Cannibal Corpse using a variety of song-structures, tempos and ideas.  You have an extremely technical, brutal track like Frantic Disembowelment then you have tracks like Rotted Body Landslide and Decency Defied that could almost be considered, dare I say it ... &quot;catchy;&quot;  well, to a Metal fan anyhow.  I'd also like to mention that not one particular member of the band dominates the writing.  Jack Owen (guitar), Alex Webster (bass) and Pat O'Brien (guitar) all contribute songs on this album giving you a nice variety of writing-styles.<br />Lyrically, well, it's Cannibal Corpse so you can expect gore-laden themes displayed in the song titles and obviously the lyrics.  As far as the seriousness, it's brutal music with brutal lyrics.  This style of music would sound quite silly with upbeat lyrics and themes ... the lyrics are not meant to be taken seriously although they often are ... for a reason I don't know.<br />The Wretched Spawn also comes with a bonus DVD that is simply awesome.  I have been a musician for over eight years and I really enjoyed seeing Cannibal Corpse describe their set-ups, how the studio time works and the like.  The bonus DVD is a true treat for musicians and fans alike giving you a good look into Cannibal Corpse's studio-life.  There are also some excellent jam sessions recorded for the DVD that are mind-blowing (especially Frantic Disembowelment).  Basically, if you're a musician  (or a fan) you'll definitely appreciate the bonus DVD featured here.<br />Overall, I'd say this is possibly the best Death Metal album I've heard yet.  If you consider yourself a Cannibal Corpse fan you are definitely missing out if you don't pick this one up.  If you are just beginning to explore brutal Death Metal, this is definitely a good place to start.  Simply put, a killer album from a killer band.
B00000K3G8|5.0|I first heard Stop Making Sense when I was 7 years old.  Having grown up with Talking Heads and had an affinity for live recordings, my father bought the CD for me.  I loved all nine tracks on the original album.  At age 10, I saw the film and was introduced to Stop Making Sense in all its glory.  There were a lot of songs in the film which were not included on the album and I wondered why.  Every single song blew my mind, and I wanted so much to hear all the music without having to go to my VCR to watch the film just to hear it.  People made double albums back in the 80s, why couldn't it have been released as a double album?<br />Thankfully, with the release of the DVD came the re-release of the Stop Making Sense album, with all the songs from the film as well as the original 9.  But I was a little skeptical.  Two songs on here from the retrospective Sand In the Vaseline, \\"Life During Wartime\\" and \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\" had been edited down, the latter in particular being chopped to shreds, leaving out almost an entire verse.  This was the case with even more songs on the vinyl release of the album, with most of the songs being shortened way too much.  I worried that all of the songs would be edited down, and that the full-length versions would be lost forever.  Finally, after receiving the DVD this past Christmas, my love for Stop Making Sense was rekindled, I saw this CD in Virgin Megastore for 10 bucks, and decided that for that price it couldn't be that bad, edited or not, so I picked it up.<br />Thankfully, the editing is very minscule, even unnoticeable.  There are minor edits in \\"Slippery People\\" and \\"What A Day That Was,\\" but they are almost unnoticeable.  For the most part, the songs have remained untouched, and are here as we have always known them.  \\"Girlfriend Is Better,\\" thankfully, is here in its entirety, as it was on the original CD/cassette version of the album.  \\"Life During Wartime\\" remains unedited, as does everything else.  Along with mostly untouched songs from the original album, we also get the other songs from the film.  The album sounds great and fresh, the remastering job is phenomenal.  It's great to hear these awesome versions of \\"Found A Job,\\" \\"Genius Of Love,\\" \\"Making Flippy Floppy,\\" and \\"This Must Be The Place\\" in great sound quality.  Of course, fitting all of these tracks onto one CD means cutting out long bursts of crowd noise and in-between song chatter that graces many a great live recording, but that is not a big deal at all.  The important thing is, we get the album we should have gotten to begin with, and it's a long overdue relief.  I am, as I'm sure many others are, very relieved that the songs aren't edited, and the album is what it should have been and what it should be.<br />Of course, I am a huge fan of the film, it's one of, if not the, greatest concert films I've ever seen.  However, if the music sucked, the movie wouldn't be as good.  I hear plenty of people rave about the movie, but no one ever talks about the music, which is incredible.  The band is really tight, it's amazing that this is a live recording.  Perhaps there were some overdubs done later, I don't know, but it's still a great record nonetheless.  I recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Talking Heads.  Don't worry, don't hesitate, this is the album we have been waiting for and what we should have gotten to begin with.  Buy this and enjoy it for a long time to come.  I'm gonna end this review before I start to ramble on and stop making sense, so buy this CD, you will not be disappointed.<br />5/5
B00007E8V4|5.0|this is the best nu metal ever!!!!! SOAD is the only band you can rock out to and still laugh your ass of at the lyrics. I have bought every cd from them, even soundtracks that have them on it. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
B00018D44U|4.0|Must admit when I first listened to this CD I would have given in a 2.  Having been a big fan of her first this seemed like a disappointment.  Having listened to it a number of times, it is now a favorite.  Not as showy, this is more subtle and low key.  It reminds me of a quiet time after a dinner party, or staying up late and talking to a friend.  I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars but wasn't prepared to give it a 5.  If you don't need to be hit over the head with big orchestrations, or looking for a number one radio hit, then you will probably enjoy this.  Hats off to Norah and crew for taking the more difficult road, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; does just that.
B00018TI5E|5.0|John Frusciante's 'Shadows Collide With People' is a 64 minute journey through the history of music. Ambient synthesizers lace together the last 50 years of guitar-driven rock into a masterpiece that is a must have. From the most pop friendly songs such as 'Song To Sing When I'm Lonely', to the Pink Floyd-esque epic '23 go into end', this album brushes on many different genres of music from many time eras. Frusciante also experiments quite often in this album, memorably a hauntingly three-dimensional 'Failure33 Object'. The sound seems to come out of a hundred different focii, all through your ears. The theme of the album is similar to the title, an attempt to unmask the true nature of reality. The result is a universal theme in an album, contrasting the typical album of today, with a similar musical style with different messages to each song. This is consistent with Frusciante's previous work, however it seems like he has expanded his musical palette. The synthesizers that dominated Frusciante's previous work have been replaced with more ambience, more tranquility, and a more suitable approach to Frusciante's message. Josh Klinghoffer assists Frusciante, as well as Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith and Flea, Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez, and others. <br />There is a definite familar style of playing that Frusciante exhibits in this album, the solos are all rather slow with more expression placed in each chord (with the exception of the ultra-fast paced 'Second Walk', reminiscient of the Mother's Milk days.) This album is not the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and is good for not being so.<br />This album is definitely the best album I've had the pleasure of listening to this year, and prehaps one of the best albums I've ever listened to. Similar music to this would be Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd, OK Computer era Radiohead, with elements of Funk, Jazz, Punk, and Rock from every era imaginables (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s). An acoustic masterpiece!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I totally fell in love with the story of Spirited Away, the storyline was like nothing i've ever watched. Spirited Away was better, in many aspects, than Princess Mononoke. The character development is very interesting, and the characters themselves are very endearing. Animation-wise, Spirited Away was beyond excellent.
B00006879E|5.0|I bought Songs About Jane back in December for my sister, but i keep taking it and playing it. This has to be one of the best CD's i've ever heard. Usually when you get a CD it only has a couple of good songs, but all of the ones on Songs for Jane are Good. Some better than others but not a bad one in the bunch. I was going to give this CD a rating of 10 but the ratings only go up to 5. I strongly recommend buying this CD.

The author decribes her brutal rape while in college and how the police tell her she is &quot;lucky.&quot;  The story follows Alice as she and her family deal with the aftermath and the profound effect it has on all aspects of her life. The pain and trauma just goes on and on through many twists and turns of the story. <BR>This is a graphic story that may be difficult for many to read.
B00013BN4S|5.0|1975's Pieces of the Sky was Emmylou Harris' major label debut.  It is also part of Rhino's recent reissue of her first five Reprise albums.  <br />Pieces of the Sky established a high standard that Harris maintained for years to come.  Her blueprint included the assemblage of stellar musicians, among them the legendary guitarist James Burton who had earlier worked his magic on numerous recordings by Rick Nelson and Elvis Presley.  Also, an extremely eclectic song selection, with new compositions such as &quot;Bluebird Wine&quot; (by her future Hot Band member Rodney Crowell) and Harris' own &quot;Boulder To Birmingham,&quot; alongside covers of the Louvin Brother's &quot;If I Could Only Win Your Love,&quot; Lennon &amp; McCartney's &quot;For No One&quot; and Dolly Parton's &quot;Coat Of Many Colors.&quot;  <br />&quot;Too Far Gone&quot; (# 13 country) and &quot;If I Could Only Win Your Love&quot; (# 4 country, # 58 pop) were this album's singles.  For these remastered Rhino reissues, they have also included two bonus tracks on each cd.  The additions to Piece Of The Sky are a pair of Dallas Frazier compositions, &quot;Hank And Lefty&quot; and &quot;California Cottonfields&quot; whose ultra-traditional sound fits in nicely with the rest of the original album.
0316666343|5.0|This certainly isn't a feel good type of book, but the dark, haunting story keeps you hanging on to the end.  Once you start reading, you don't want to put it down.  The story follows the disappearance of a young girl and the community and family reaction to that.  The main character comes alive as she deals with all the things happening in her life.  The author does such a good job of evoking feelings in the writer while reading.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|Way over-produced, boring. What happened to the unique style of the first album? Alicia, why did you let this happen to you? I am soooo disappointed.  I was playing it while doing chores and forgot who I was listening to. What happened Alicia?  I will hope you get back to yourself for you next effort.
6305603847|5.0|As a long time Pink Floyd fan, I saw this film for the first time on its opening night.  The crowd was packed, noisy; mostly teens, early twenty-somethings, they expected a concert film.  I was lucky to see it in one of the last truly large screen houses while it was in its prime.  I was initially concerned by the talking and laughing of the sold-out crowd.  Soon, there was no worry.  It was the quietest full house I've ever been in.  I looked around at one point about ten minutes into the movie.  Mesmerized.  Mouths open, no laughing, no talking, no popcorn eating.<br />Why an anecdote instead of a review?  That's the most pointed thing I could say.  No other movie has so grabbed an audience, defied their expectations, and held them in thrall like Pink Floyd The Wall.<br />3 strong personalities collided:  Roger Waters, Alan Parker, and Gerald Scarfe.  By all rights, it should have been a mess.  Amazon reviewer calls it a fascinating failure.  There is nothing failing here.  The narrative works on a number of levels.  The paranoid rock star who sees himself as a fascist youth leader is only one of the more superficial.  Take a look.
B0000CDL3W|2.0|Why didn't they use Edward Furlong as John Conner in this film?????? He was the right age and everything. Furlong is handsome with a dangerous edge (like John Conner). Instead they cast Nick Stahl, the goofiest, goofiest, dorkiest actor in the history of cinema.  Nick Stahl makes Ben Stiller look like Sean Connery. They poured hundreds of millions of dollars into making and marketing this film...and ruined it from the get-go with a wretchedly moronic casting choice.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko was released to mediocre reviews and low box-office sales, but its rising popularity since its release on DVD has proven that it is a cult classic of the most unique nature.<br />The film explores teen angst, religion, love, and science fiction, all in an unorthadox presentation that may leave you scratching your head, but nontheless inspired by its haunting brilliance.  The solution is there if you have the ingenuity to ponder it - I'll just say it has a lot to do with divine intervention to teach a lesson and finding resolution to the painful complications of teen life.  (If you want the whole story, you can e-mail me).<br />The film is set in the 80s, and director Richard Kelly does a superb job in giving it a distinct 80s aura.  You'll think you're watching a movie that was really made in the 80s.  Combining this style with the vivid and eerie soundtrack, Donnie Darko is sure to leave a lasting impression on you and will give you a lot to think about.  If it leaves you feeling frustrated, there are plenty of online resources to help you sort it out.  The filmmakers admit that with the editing job done to the movie, certain things do not make definitive sense.  Supposedly a newly-edited version is being released in theaters sometime soon.  Nontheless, it is impossible to see this movie without being stirred.  This DVD is a must-own for any movie collector.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Have you ever just wanted to quit your job, due to it's monotony, misery, or drudgery? Well, come to METROPOLIS and see what it's all about! See the fun-loving upper class, frolicking their days away, running through eternal gardens, complete with peacocks and babes in funny clothes! Then, travel deep below ground to where the workers toil their days away, slaving over titanic machines that suck the life right out of their bodies and putrify their souls! Sound like your job? Thankfully, Maria is there to comfort the workers and give them hope of future deliverance at the hands of a great \\"mediator\\". Freder, the son of METROPOLIS' top dog and despotic ruler, is mesmerized by Maria and falls in love with her. This leads to problems since she's such a trouble-maker! Frader's dad goes to his mad scientist, Rotwang to check on his latest creation, a robot with very feminine curves. The two evil minds decide to turn the robot into a Maria-double, a wicked doppelgangar, which will destroy her image in the minds of the workers. Unfortunately for dad, Rotwang has ideas of his own and sends his mecha-Maria on a mission to incite the working class to bring down the machines upon which their very lives depend. This will bring METROPOLIS to the ground and ruin Freder sr. (dad) in the process. METROPOLIS is amazing for 1927. The robot scenes are almost supernatural in their effect. The portrayal of the workers as plodding, hopeless drones is unforgettable. Brigitte Helm pulls off her dual role as good Maria / evil Maria with ease and believability. She is modest and virginal one minute, then wanton and sly the next! The city scape and lower levels of the workers' world are surreal. Fritz Lang made a true masterpiece. This is one of a handful of movies that everyone should see at least once before they die... P.S.- UPDATE- I just watched THE COMPLETE METROPOLIS (on 4-4-13), and I was astonished by its near perfection. Even w/ the still missing pieces, the 25 minutes found in 2008(in Buenos Aires) are spectacular, fleshing things out more. The original score is incredible. The full restoration is beautiful. A true work of cinematic genius...
B000001IPL|5.0|It's hard to say which Offspring cd is the best, many people say this one. Although I'm not sure I agree (too much competition for me) those people have good reason to call this the best Offspring album.<br />Time to Relax, a good intro, a little bit worse then disclaimer and Neocon. No rating<br />2. Nitro, a good opening track, the guitar sticks in your head badly. The lyrics dont make much sense but they sound cool. 9.5/10<br />3. Bad Habit, a fun song about road rage, this is the one I heard first off this album. One of the songs that shows what the Offspring are like. 9.5/10<br />4. Gotta Get Away, an awesome song with a great chorus. Has some cool lyrics and a weird music video. 10/10<br />5. Genocide, a song with an awesome guitar riff (used at the end of the album and in the Ixnay song Change the World). A fun song to sing aloud because of the dog eat dog line. 10/10<br />6. Something to Believe in, I don't know why people dont like this, it has an AWESOME chorus and a great interlude. 10/10<br />7. Come out and Play, a really fun song that I still hear on the radio all the time. The lyrics are hard to figure out but they are good. 10/10<br />8. Self Esteem, another single, a cool song that I heard awhile before I bought this album. A little slow but has good guitar. 9.5/10<br />9. It'll be a Long Time, the only song on the album I don't love. It's ok but not spectacular. 7/10<br />10. Killboy Powerhead, The 2nd worst song on the album, but <BR>that dosent mean its bad, 7.5/10<br />11. What Happened to You, pretty good and funny 8.5/10<br />12. So Alone, I get it confused with All Along from CO1, I'm not sure which is better. 9/10<br />13. Not the One, awesome awesome lyrics with cool guitar, I love this one 10/10<br />14. Smash, aaaaaaaaah the best song on the album. Awesome lyrics and cool guitar. The bridge is AWESOME AND COOL. Wow this is good. 11/10
B00005N5S5|5.0|In the year 2029 there takes place a war between man and machine. Skynet is the name of the cybornetic force trying to wipe out human kind. When Skynet is on the brink of extinction a T-1800 a.k.a a Terminator. It's mission is to wipe out the mother of John Conner, the leader of the human race. Sarah Conner (John Conner's Mother) is a normal 80's chick, she has a boyfriend who keeps on telling her to amke a raincheck on their dates. She lives with a roommate and has a pet lizard life is good. Then the Terminator is sent back to 1984 (the time in which she is living in). At that same time a human warrior from the future has come to protect her, Kyle Reese. Not knowing what he really is against he takes all precasions neccessary. The real battle of future fate of man doesn't take place in the future but in the past.<br />In my opinion this is Arnolds best movie, it won't be forgotten easily. It is suspensful and will keep you guessing, will the terminator get her? The beginning is quite amazing, I mean it isn't mind blowing graphics for our time. If you look closely I think you might be able to see the strings. But the effects aren't what count. It is how the plot and film is portrayed. James Cameron did a superb job in filming this. The DVD features are actually quite interesting, you might keep yourself busy for a few hours watching them. I suggest watching this one before any of the sequels. Personally I think the sequels are a waste of time. The third one is better than the second one because it actually shows judgement day. The second one is alright because it has Linda Hamilton. We all will agree that Linda Hamilton is the real meat behind the series along thi Arnold Schwarzenegger. I strongly suggest that if you have seen this movie, or have good things about it then purchase it. It's worth the money.<br />PARENTAL WARNING: There is Strong Language, Strong Graphic Violence/ Violent Images, Sexuality/Nudity<br />AGE TO WATCH AT: I would think that by 14 or 15 you'd be ready to watch it. Thats when I watched it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Originally a Coldplay fan I heard mention that Coldplay was sort of like a Radiohead-Lite.  Interested, I paid a little more attention to what was at the time their latest single, &quot;There There&quot;.  I was so intrigued by that song that I bought the single and then later Hail To The Thief.  At this point I was totally won over and realized that I had to find out about their older music which many described as being even better than HTTT.  I went to my local library and checked out some of their cds.  Kid A was the first to come but I deemed it too odd and left it for later. (My opinion on it would later change, though).  Eventually, OK Computer came along and I was totally knocked off my feet.  Airbag's first notes seemed so magical, Paranoid Android so perfectly complex, and Subterrannean Homesick Alien so quirky.  Exit Music is a tad gloomy but empowering nonetheless.  Let Down is a misnomer, being one of the albums high points (which really says something).  Karma Police is just cool, and Fitter Happier is just plain creepy.  Electioneering is a riot and Climbing Up The Walls is even creepier than Fitter Happier.  No Surprises is such a peaceful tune and Lucky is extravagant.  The Tourist is a perfect closer (though not as perfect as Street Spirit off THe Bends).  Overall, it's the best album I have ever heard, and If you give it a listen, I'm sure it will be a favourite of yours too.  It might take a while though as the first few listens it will just blow right over your head.  Like any good relationship, loving things takes time, which goes for this cd too.  OK Computer is as perfect as Alternative Rock (or whatever you want to call it) gets.
B00009RDG9|3.0|The Hunted begins in 1999, we find Aaron Hallam (Del Toro) in Kosovo. Aaron and his team of marines are on a assasination mission, their mission is assasinate a General who is leading a series of massacres in Kosovo. Hallam witnesses these massacres, images of burning houses and women and children being driven into the street, civilians being shot. Any normal person would snap, this he did. After leaving Kosovo Hallam suffers war trauma, he gets an award then slips into madness. We then the film transititions to his military instructor who taught him to assasinate. Also the man who was like a father to him. His name is LT. Bonham who is retired and helps animals out in canada. He has been asked by the FBI to help bring Hallam in.<br />Well I thought that end just left you hanging, you want more but what more can it give you. Very dry movie, if you want to watch a similar better version of this movie with mostly the same actors then I will suggest \\"The Fugitive\\" and \\"U.S Marshalls\\". Both good movies, this is just alot gorier than both. Its worth watching but the end leaves you asking for more and boy it sure pisses me off. I like the narrative by Johnny Cash in the beginning and the end. It gives it a real tense feel. If you really enjoyed \\"U.S Marshalls\\" or \\"The Fugitive\\" I suggest this, but don't get your hopes up for it to be better, the only thing that is better is the action. If the director had mixed the action with some really great twists and turns then this movie would've been alot better. It's rent worthy in my opinion, don't buy it. I personally liked the special features and the Documentaries, they were the boost of the whole DVD. They're fun to watch!<br />PARENTAL WARNING: Strong Bloody/Gore violence and Some Language<BR>SUGGESTED AGE: Hmm... I would say that I think a twelve or thirteen year old that is mature enough and MUST have a strong stomach that could handle it.
B000127LW2|1.0|I have all the other Star Trek DVDs and couldn't wait for Voyager.  I haven't seen the DVDs yet, but the packaging is absolutely unacceptable!  It's flimsy (the thickness of throw-away &quot;bubble-pack&quot;), takes too many steps to take it apart, doesn't protect the DVDs properly, and is overall the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  Whoever invented it should be fired and whoever made the administrative decision to use it should be boiled in oil! BOO!!!
B000007OY0|5.0|As of this writing, it's been ten years since the release of this now-classic, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, and it doesn't show any signs of aging, much like the soul of the main character, played by Robbins, who remained intact through his tenure in the Shawshank prison in spite of having been locked away for life (for two life terms, actually, something I've always had a hard time understanding...)<br />The movie, much like &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; a few years later, takes place in a time and in a setting that would not initially raise too many &quot;suspicions&quot; about its high caliber. The performances thrown by both actors are supreme, with a friendship like few I can recall on the screen building up throughout the story. The script is simply brilliant (can't give much away without spoiling it for those readers who still haven't had the privilege of watching it)... and there was a moment that I will always take with me (and this was waaay before a similar moment also became a classic in &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;): when Andy plays a sublime aria on the speakers of the prison, and everyone shut up, dropped what they were doing and turned around quietly to almost contemplate the sound of the two Italian singers singing away their souls, making those prisoners forget about everything else if just for a few moments, feeling free in their hearts.<br />This movie will be close to my heart always and it is one that I can recommend with my eyes closed once and again. Five stars!
B000069CWE|5.0|The best remix album I've ever heard!!!!!!!!!!! The songs are so different that they can't simply be called &quot;remixes.&quot; They are reanimated! Heavy hip hop beats. This cd is awesome..
B00018D44U|5.0|I love this album!!  I'll admit it took a couple of listens to really appreciate this album and Norah's beautiful voice. This album is definitely more upbeat and offers a little of blues, jazz, and country.  I'm not a fan of country music, but I absolutely love every song on this album, including the country songs. The band is GREAT, too. Buy this CD because it is a &quot;must have&quot;!!!
B00006DEFA|5.0|Its well known to Mozart scholars that he was under-appreciated during his lifetime. Successful to a degree, yes, but still not recognized as the genius he truly was. Salieri, as depicted in this film does his best to gently move the spotlight away from Wolfgang BUT he also is shown to admire and revere Mozarts talent and music. It is  known that historically, on his deathbed, Salieri &quot;confessed&quot; to killing Mozart. Perhaps in his ill mind, he felt he helped to crush the life from the young composer.  In any case, this story, and indeed the new &quot;Directors Cut&quot; of this film is a masterpiece. If there are flaws, it does not show, nor would it overshadow the majesty and profound beauty of this film.  This DVD transfer FINALLY has captured the incredible and delicate color I remember seeing in the theater in 1984. The previous VHS transfers and first DVD release looked brown and dull... this version looks clean, crisp and vibrant in color. The sound is wonderful and the new cut clarifies Constanza's determination to promote her husbands music and the lengths she was willing to go for it with Salieri, a point that was not as clear in the shorter version.  As others have said, F. Murray Abraham's performance is amazing, mesmerizing, determined and flawless...... but let's not forget Tom Hulce.... he is also an actor who was brilliant in this difficult and demanding role as the fun-loving, drunken, loveable, spoiled but brilliant genius Mozart was. Bravo!!!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I am appeased to all this apathy. Room on fire is fun and catchy and everything the strokes should be. I can just imagine them running round new york, hair flying in the wind, just running from all these disappointing 1 and 2 star reviews. Don't look behind you, boys! Look in front, to me, where I stand with my arms wide open and strokey love in my eyes.
0385504209|1.0|Low grade fairy tale. I understand what people are saying about it &quot;just being a book&quot;, but Brown himself claims the historical references are fact. Actually, they are not fact and the stretches of conjecture used are rather insulting propaganda. Why do people reward this? The people that like this book say it makes them think, but if it made us educate ourselves about history then Dan might deserve his money.<br />It's easy to be condescending to readers that become angry at &quot;a work of fiction&quot; but the book is not presented as fiction and many readers are believing it.<br />People should be saddened by this book and what it represents but instead they turn their attention and anger toward a movie that teaches love and compassion in the face of brutality. What does this book teach? All teachings require faith - which deserves it more? (Borrow a copy - it seems that everyone is buying it.)
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is a masterpiece!! If you call yourself a fan of rock music, this CD will be on your shelf as soon as is humanly possible. The diversity of the tracks, from screaming punk to stoner bass, is unparalleled in any other CD I have ever heard. These guys are the real deal. They have actual talent. Buy this CD
B000002UVZ|4.0|With &quot;Life's Rich Pageant,&quot; REM does an about-face from the arty &quot;Fables.&quot;  The drums are pushed to the forefront, the guitars use a lot of distortion, the song structure is more direct, and Michael Stipe can now be comprehended about 2/3 of the time (as opposed to 1/3 of the time on the three previous CDs).  However, the production isn't nearly as cleanly polished as &quot;Document,&quot; almost seeming like it was recorded live in some places.  Despite the welcome jolt of energy, I feel that tracks 5, 6, 8, and 9 are a little bland and underdeveloped.
B000002Q7Y|4.0|Three years after Kansas's dissolution, original members Steve Walsh, Phil Ehart, and Richard Williams reformed by recruiting some new members.  The result was Power, which was more suited to the 80's sound prevalent then, with more in common to Journey and Survivor's style rather than the days of &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; or &quot;Point of No Return.&quot;<br />The first single, &quot;All I Wanted&quot; was comparable to a mid-tempo Journey yearning love song laced with keyboards and pop sensibilities.  It made the charts and the video led to a brief second wind.<br />However, songs like the racing &quot;Silhouettes In Disguise,&quot; featuring riveting guitarwork shows Kansas still a force to be reckoned with, despite the semblance to Journey.<br />The title track and one of the singles tells how power can be used for self-affirmation and liberation instead of fortune and pride.  Survivor could have fun with this song.<br />Orchestra warmups are heard in the beginning of &quot;Secret Service.&quot;  The steady drumbeat, pulsing bass, and multiple backing vocals make this more a Foreigner-type song, a cousin to &quot;Jukebox Hero.&quot;  And there is some orchestra work used here.<br />A Boston-like guitar opens and his heard throughout &quot;We're Not Alone Anymore&quot; and there is a slight throwback to their earlier sound.  &quot;Musicatto&quot; is an insistent instrumental drums and keyboard fills heralding the art-rock feel of the 1970's and the three serious thematic songs that follow.  &quot;Taking In The View&quot; is an acoustic number about how the young embody progress, different POVs, and push the envelope of generation.  &quot;Three Pretenders&quot; is more harder-edged with Survivor riffs.  Childhood skepticism, personal integrity, and the call to adventure are what the protagonist is fighting to keep against the title characters.  And &quot;Tomb 19&quot; is about the treasure-filled tomb of a Mayan king and the curse that await those who try to rob it has a Sodom and Gomorrah-like motif:  &quot;take the treasures of Tomb 19 but never look behind you.&quot;<br />The final song and second single, &quot;Can't Cry Anymore,&quot; is a Survivor-type ballad with synth fills that grow in power with each chorus repeat.  One of my favourite tracks.<br />A laudable work from a 70's group trying for a second wind in the synth-oriented 80's.  Much of it sounds like Journey or Survivor, but it's not second-rate.ob it has a Sodom and Gomorrah-like motif:  &quot;take the treasures of Tomb 19 but never look behind you.&quot;<br />The final song and second single, &quot;Can't Cry Anymore,&quot; is a Survivor-type ballad with synth fills that grow in power with each chorus repeat.

B000065PUE|2.0|With the exception of a few tracks, this CD mostly consists of noise, dissonance, and screaming.  Definitely better than nu-metal, but still not something I listen to on a regular basis.  It's not bad if I'm in a really grouchy mood and need to let off a little steam.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Talk about your hidden dragons.  Director Ang Lee seems quite determined to make, if not an art film, then at least an artistic one.  He directs his movie with an eye for green-tinged beauty; the photography is lavish and layered, the color darkened until you can barely tell what's going on.  It's almost enough to distract you from the fact that the film isn't going anywhere.  When the Hulk isn't smashing, the movie's catatonic (albiet a well-filmed bout with catatonia), and Lee's repeated hammering at the film's theme is a poor substitute for human dimension.  Lee is sailing a barge through a creek.  Still, there's much to be liked in the ambitious (if not quite perfected) special effects, and the cast is a strong one.  It's a long and humorless film, but seeing it is better than missing it.  Features Jennifer Connelly, Josh Lucas, Nick Nolte, and Eric Bana as the Hulk's gentler half.
B000002LFU|3.0|And here you have it, the first album REM with songs that I never listen to.  Tracks 1-5 (ESPECIALLY 5) are all very good.  However, track 6, though it has good mandolin, never really goes anywhere.  Track 8 is a weary arena rock, while track 9 also never takes off (track seven does kick some butt though).  Track 10 is a bad rehash of \\"Oddfellows Local 151,\\" while the last track is simply tepid.  The pace of the CD is jarring, with 2 up-tempo, hard rock songs followed by one slow song w/o drums, followed by 2 more up-tempo songs, etc.  Definitely not one of the best and possibly the worst.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I have no idea what about this movie has garnered it so much hype.   As many have said before-- boring characters.   I didn't ever see this relationship develop.  It's just boring to watch characters who are so pathetically lost in one of the most interesting cities in the world.   Oh, poor, rich, white me.  Please.  That leads me to the racism of the the backdrop of Japanese characters.  Never developed as  characters  and always the butt of the joke.   This is a problem.     A great antidote to culture shock is to connect with people in the country you are in.  You know, connect with one another as human beings.  Maybe this would have kept Scarlett Johansson from looking for daddy in the most readily available American.
B000002U82|5.0|it creeps the hell out of me. best album to trip to.

B000000WJZ|5.0|The drum rolls, then falls away for a building electric guitar, a drum, and a searingly vibrant wall of sound that rises before your very ears. This is the start of &quot;Siamese Dream,&quot; a vintage Smashing Pumpkins album and one of the best, most underrated alternative rock albums ever released.<br />Opening with a bang is the dizzying &quot;Cherub Rock,&quot; a song that serves as a perfect springboard into the heart of this album. It can shift in an instant between pulse-pounding (the deceptively-named &quot;Quiet&quot;) and more progressive (&quot;Hummer&quot;). Corgan's range stretches even to the quiet (&quot;Sweet Sweet&quot;), the dramatic (&quot;Disarm&quot; with its bells and violins) or the catchy (the plaintive &quot;Spaceboy&quot;).<br />Perhaps the most outstanding thing about the Pumpkins is their seamless blend of metal, neo-psychedelica and art-rock. The blasting electric riffs, sprawling melodies, and the whirling, sinuous guitars are all interwoven without so much as a sonic burp. At first glance, it seems like a fairly typical rock/metal album, but upon further listening, the alluringly complicated music begins to filter itself fully into your brain.  Corgan's lyrics aren't for the perky among you -- angsty and introspective, while avoiding the trap of self-pity.<br />It's difficult to find a musical flaw with the Pumpkins in &quot;Siamese Dream.&quot; Corgan's high voice flitters between murmuring and wailing. Backing him up are James Iha's layered, whirling guitar riffs and Jimmy Chamberlain's controlled, fast drumming. Acoustic guitar also gets to shine at the start of &quot;Disarm.&quot; What sounds like church bells is even used.<br />Fiercely adventurious, brooding and expressive, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; is a breathtaking ride into a majestic rock world all its own. Inventive and enticing, this is a modern classic.
B00008J4P5|1.0|The success of this album has shocked me.After listening to the album you begin to wonder how it won so many awards,and sold so many copies.The track that made me buy the album &quot;seven nation army&quot; is the only good song on the cd.The rest is no where near and then you have to ask why these two call themselves a rock band.The music is horrible and no where near rock.Refrain from buying this cd.These guys got lucky and don't deserve the fame.
B00005JKG9|3.0|After hearing rave reviews of this movie for the last couple of years, I finally rented it.  After nearly two hours of absolutely nothing, other than a good line or two from Al Pacino, it was over.  I honestly wondered if I fell asleep and missed something.  What a disappointment.<br />This film starts very strong with a great five minute performance from Alec Baldwin. He makes you believe you have just sat down to witness true perfection.  He reminds the salesmen to &quot;Always Be Closing&quot; (ABC).  He then tells them of a competition.  The top sales person gets a car, second place gets a set of steak knives and the third gets fired.  There is no room for losers in this dramatically masculine world; only &quot;closers&quot; will get the good sales leads. There is a lot of pressure to succeed, so a robbery is committed which has unforseen consequences for all the characters.  Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino in particular are incredible, they play off each other so well.  This movie is not far from reality. Many salespeople (myself included) who work in the &quot;boiler room&quot; often end up burnt out, divorced, and wasted.

B00008H2LB|1.0|this album is really bad. it may sound good to all these false reviews. hybrid theory was awsome. linkin park overall used to be awesome. until reanimation came out. i bought reanimation and i thought &quot;well even though this album is horrible maybe meteora wont be&quot;. i bought the cd, i listened to this album for about a week, thinking it had to get better. at first when i bought it was crap and the more minutes wasted on listening to this cd it got alot worse. Somewhere i belong is the only good song on this cd. but after about listening to it for the 3rd time i realized that it has got to be the most annoying song ive heard in a long time. its repetitive playing on MTV and the radio was unbeleivable. i sat there wondering how any person could stand this garbage. they may have matured musically wise but it still was a horrible album.i honestly gave this album a try for about 2 weeks, but i still stand by what i have said, and its horrible!! if you like hybrid theory, do not buy this album. good charlotte (even though i hate them becuz they are really horrible) are heavier than these guys! i cannot beleive that Meteora was in the top 10 albums. even in the top 50! go buy a real album like a Slipknot,Godsmack,Mudvayne,or System Of A Down album. they are at least worth the money.
6302973724|5.0|I'm not going to give an unhelpful, moronic &quot;DM rules&quot; review. I was at one of their concerts during this tour and the video allows me to truly re-live it! The quality (for VHS) is excellent, but as stated in this forum, THIS VIDEO MUST BE CONVERTED TO DVD (and DTS would be a nice touch too)!!!! I bought this a while ago when VHS was in vogue but sadly I would NOT recommend purchasing it today since I'd never recommend the purchase of something imminently obsolete.
B00005JKG9|1.0|I heard people refer to this movie when they were enthusiastically trying to illustrate a point about sales or something along those lines.  I rented it and was severely disappointed.  I have an MBA in finance and a PhD in psychology, so it's not a matter of a lack of qualifications to appreciate a fine film.  With the exception of a few lines here and there, the movie is just plain boring.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones is my ideal lady. In this, her second album, she has not sold out as so many others have done the second time around. Rather, she stays true to her style. And she's one classy young lady.<br />She is a great talent, as a singer, songwriter, and pianist. <br />When I bought her &quot;Live in New Orleans&quot; DVD, I really enjoyed it. But it was weak in parts. She seemed to lack stage presence, and her drummer was pretty pathetic. But when I bought her first album, I realized how good she really was.<br />It didn't require much deliberation to purchase her second album when it came out. And I'm glad I bought it.<br />There are 12 really good songs on this CD. Norah wrote or co-wrote most of them. Notice I said 12 good songs. There are 13 on the CD. The only exception to the excellent work is when Dolly Parton was invited to sing along on one of the tracks.  I can't stand that woman. Her shrill singing voice leaves me cold, like a million fingernails scratching across a giant blackboard.<br />But skipping over that track, the remainder of the album is fabulous. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy really soft jazz/blues.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I am laughing at the guy from &quot;Athens Greece&quot; who knows NOTHING about the United States or the Civil War .. the so called Draft Riots were not , they were Irish led Race Riots and 500 people were killed by the rioters including Blacks (the main victims) Protestants and Business men and women.<BR>Yes US troops had to come in under arms but there were NO &quot;bombardment&quot; of NY .. only by the English during the Revolutionary War.<BR>Obviously this guy from the good old boy south (not Athens Greece) is still upset over the Slavery crimes of the south.<BR>Read a fine book called Black Blue and Gray by Jim Haskins for the FACTS.<BR>This movie was a Leftist revisionist MESS without fact or historical relevance.
B00006879E|5.0|One of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. The sound is definitely pop/rock with an element of R&amp;B. The lead singer sounds like Stevie Wonder and the band's style is reminscent of Matchbox 20, the Wallflowers and the Police.<br />Almost all the tracks would qualify as Top 10 singles, which is rare on most albums put out these days. This CD actually reminds of one of Sting's best releases, 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles.'<br />'Must Get Out,' 'The Sun,' and 'Sunday Morning' are probably the three best songs on this CD. And almost every track is introspective, and well-written. <br />This album has honestly taken me by surprise, and I am very impressed. Good stuff.
B000002UAR|5.0|I'm not going to pretend to be a Beatlemaniac. I am not. My tastes in music is rooted firmly in the present, maybe the future as well. Nevertheless The Beatles without a doubt helped change rock music. The only cds I own by The Beatles are few, I own their #1 compilation, \\"Rubber Soul\\", and \\"Revolver\\". I bought \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" because they are considered essential recordings. I remember watching VH1's \\"100 Greatest Albums\\" a couple of years ago and became intrigued when \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" was being discussed so needless to say I bought them. Even though I am not a big fan of The Beatles, I will say that I do enjoy their music quite a bit. I am particularly fond of \\"Revolver\\". I really can't put into words why I like \\"Revolver\\" slightly more than \\"Rubber Soul\\" (which is still an excellent album). I enjoy the overall sound of the album  a bit more than its predecessor. I particularly enjoy the Middle Eastern influence of \\"Love You To\\", the soft gentle melodies of \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\", and the silliness of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (yes the lyrics are corny, if not albeit on the stupid side but the song itself is unbelievably catchy). George Harrison's guitar prowess really shines through on this album, especially with \\"Taxman\\". I personally do not think this album sounds dated whatsoever. I seriously doubt that we will remember most of the bands that are popular today in twenty-thirty years like we do with the much revered The Beatles today. The Beatles will still be remembered as being one of the greatest rock bands in history.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|&quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; is a worthy follow-up to SIAM. I've had the CD for awhile and it remains one of my favorites. This one is different than her first, but I feel that her music is going in the right direction. Like Norah, you have to be willing to accept the fact that her style is unconventional and not the norm. Given her youth, this album is impressive by any standard. There are no generic Pop and R&amp;B tunes, just great songs and great music. So if you want to buy something that will still sound good ten years from now, then I highly recommend \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\\" You won't be disappointed.<br />Favorites:<BR>Diary<BR>Dragon Days<BR>Karma<BR>So Simple<BR>Nobody Not Really
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I've been listening to Cannibal since 1992..and its been a pleasure to watch this band mature both musically and as people.While the whole gore novelty wore off albums ago,it's still great to see a band making extreme music and keeping this genre alive. Being that The Bleeding remains my favorite album from these guys thus far , I can't say that Wretched is the best..but it comes damn close. So what's different to this new one as opposed to the last four with Corpsegrinder? Honestly..not much. In fact,this picks up right where Gore Obsessed left us.Lyrically, I think Cannibal could write much better ,but I think they're concentrating on phrasing simple words to make catchier songs. Overall, its their best production yet..and George proves that he can sing like Chris Barnes and better.
0399226907|5.0|I remember having this book read to me when I was a child. I am an avid reader and I would like very much for my son to have a love of books. He has many of Eric Carle's books (quiet cricket, polar bear, brown bear, grouchy ladybug etc - all of which I highly recommend also!) but this is one of our favorites. We read it every night together. It is simple, colorful and funny. It combines food, days of the week and numbers, as well as the life cycle of the caterpillar. It is books like this that introduce children to a lifetime of fun and enjoyment with reading.
0151008116|4.0|This book was a little slow at the start but just kept picking up speed.  A wonderful story on so many levels.  It tells the story of the one boy's fight to stay alive after his boat sank.  He survives 227 days in a lifeboat with his Bengal tiger Richard Parker.  A great defense of zoos and a heart searching commentary on the power of God.  Defintely recommended.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|the Italian Job was fun to watch, it has an intersting plot &amp; its not a remake of the 1960's film. In this film its nothing like the old one, i would like to say that it is better than the michal cane classic Italian Job , but that would just be lieing.<br />this film could have been great film, but it was just missing sumthing, but never the less it was a good film witch i enjoyed. It starts off fast with a boat race &amp; lots of action but in the middle it slows down abit, but the end reedems the hole film with an unexpected twist.<br />I would strongly advice anyone to buy this dvd because its one of those films that you can watch over &amp; over. And the lovely Mark Wahlberg really makes this film, other cast member include: Edward Norton (fight club) Charlize Theron (monster) Seth Green (from buffy) Jason Statham (he was also in snacth and the kit kat adverts lol) &amp; finally Mos Def (monsters ball)<br />over all it is a good film.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This movie is the best thing that ever came out in dvd history... all you people talking trash should shut up beacuse it is a movie master piece, the second film gives plenty of kung fu so it doesnt need that much in the 3 film. Great movie 100 stars<br />NEO

B00018D44U|5.0|.... it grew on me. When I took my first listen at this most coveted CD, I was strangely disappointed. The style was a wee bit different from her debut. The more I listened to it though, Norah's new songs began to reawaken my love for her music. This new collection of songs, both original and remakes, is the kind that shows you the diversity of a true musician!
B000089RVX|5.0|These are the times when most bands have the same sound and at times originality is found lacking.However that is not the case with this band.Headed by lead singer Amy Lee evanescence have brought to the table a new breed of goth rock full of emotion and strong heavy music.Going through the tracks on the cd makes you realise that the music on offer is original and superb.The first track \\"going under\\" is heavy and is brought to life by Amy Lee's strong vocals.Tracks like \\"bring me to life\\" and \\"tourniquet\\" are in the same mould whereas slow tracks like \\"my immortal\\" and \\"hello\\" give the record some variation.Anybody who listens to rock has got to buy this cd to appreciate the awesome music on offer.Let me end it by saying that evanescence rocks!<br />1)Going under-10/10<br />2)Bring me to life-10/10<br />3)Everybody's fool-9/10<br />4)My immortal-10/10<br />5)Haunted-8/10<br />6)Tourniquet-10/10<br />7)Imaginery-7/10<br />8)Taking over me-10/10<br />9)Hello-8/10<br />10)My last breath-10/10<br />11)Whisper-10/10
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Honestly, watching this movie the second time on DVD made more sense, although I initially watched it to make sure I understand the Revolutions better.  Reloaded was a flop, yes.  The whole plot only grew at the last half and hour, and it really grew big.  The first hour was verrry lengthy, and I really doubt any philosophical insights took place during the first half.  The CGIs were bad, that much I can tell.  The first matrix did not dwell in technologies humans have not fully conquered.  but the cgi's in reloaded sucked, big time.  If you can literally tell, when Neo is fake, that's pretty bad, especially for such an expensive costing movie like this.  Overall, it was ok, because reloaded and revolutions are actually one big movie split into two, so it's understandable why the plot on this one came only later.  And what's with the sex scene? and the girl eating the cake?  that was out of context, man.  come on, you can do better than that, can you wachowski bros? u didn't need the geeky sex scene at all. we all know those 2 were in love and making love.  and what's with the rave? we're going to war, so lets party? reloaded was, undeniably a dissapointment.  contrary to popular opinions, i don't think revolutions was bad at all.  yes, it still was far than the first one, but it was ok.  the plot was evened out, and no crappy scenes, and less crappy CGIs. I do suggest watching Reloaded for the heck of it.  It is relatively a good movie, as long as you don't compare it with the first one.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Hybrid theory was the best rock album of 2001.Linkin Park came from nowhere to impact nu-metal in a big way.However things have been different for the release of their second studio album meteora.To start of with it's only 37 minutes long in total and each song happens to be no more than three minutes.Upon listening to the album one can clearly see that the songs are not as good as those from hybrid theory and do not have the elements that made them addictive.You'll know what i mean when you guys hear the album yourselves.For now lets just hope lnikin Park can make a comeback for their third album.They have this album to build upon,I mean it wasnt bad but they certainly can do a lot better.
B00005JLR8|5.0|In America is an absolute treat.  It can be hard to watch in many parts, but a film as good as this balances it extremely well.  The director and film makers are well deserving of their awards at the Sundance FIlm Festival and other festivals.  You get taken on a terrific emotional ride as seen through the eyes of Christie, the daughter of Irish imigrants moving to America illegaly.  The settings are not stereotypical to say the least.  Real human feeling is woven throughout the story in all the trials the family endures.  In America is well worth adding to your collection.   Don't let anyone tell you it's too \\"sticky-sweet\\".  The type of person who makes this accusation is probably just upset there's no explosions or special effects that Hollywood has become reliant on to make a buck.  See this movie.  You won't regret it.
B000002OX7|5.0|I've been listening to this for over 30 years now and it still sounds remarkably fresh. I wore out my Vinyl, the player ate my 8-track I lost my cassette but the CD survives. Over the years my musical tastes have changed and evolved as they should but this incredible collection from The WHO never strays too far from the top of my collection. The tunes still sound relevant and the music is power rock as played by one of the all time great power bands. The bonus tracks on the CD don't add much to the overall cohesiveness of the original album but they don't detract either. The original 9 tracks are uniformly great and the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. This is as good as Rock music gets. An absolute classic.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|Long Way, Rock 'n Roll singer, Live Wire, TNT, and the song, High Voltage make this a must have for any AC/DC fan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best sci-fi series since Babylon 5.  <BR>I can't believe that it would be cancelled after only 1 season.<BR>The only reason not to buy it is that you will be so disappointed that that is all there is.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Back about a year and a half ago, I managed to pick up Lynyrd Skynyrd's excellent box set a pretty much becaem a huge fan overnight, loving every one of the 47 songs on the set. Of course, with so much overlap on many other Skynyrd recordings, I really wasn't in haste to get another album, but other fans eventually convinced me that the live album had to be heard. With that in mind, I broke down and bought the classic ONE MORE FROM THE ROAD. All I really need to say is that I definatly got my money's worth out of this one. <br />Regardless of whether think the live recordings provide better verions of the songs, or if you think the studio recordings sound better, this is still essential. Even for those who prefer the more polished studio sounds, there's still simply a whole different feel in hearing the band when it has a live audience in front of it. Skynyrd interacts well with its very enthusiastic audience, Ronnie in particular obviously relishing the comaradarie between himself and his fans. This chemistry can be felt by the listener of this record, even nearly 30 years after it was recorded. The songs themselves are played with energy and intensity, and many songs such as &quot;Gimme Back My Bullets,&quot; &quot;Searchin'&quot; and even &quot;Simple Man&quot; sound better live than the studio releases.<br />The Deluxe Edetion, even though I never got to hear the original, is fantastic. The sounds is crystal clear, but still retains the warmth of vintage 70s equipment. The mix is very good, bringing ou the instruments well at all the right times (I will concede the Billy Powell's piano is a touch quiet in &quot;Workin' For MCA,&quot; but the rest is fine). Even though it wasn't entirely intential, I was pleased to read that Collins' guitar solo in &quot;Free Bird&quot; is the original, and not an overbud. Live albums should be heard as they were played live. The alternate takes don't sound much different from the originally released numbers, but they are still outstanding and thus highly welcome.<br />The bottom line is this: no Lynyrd Skynyrd fan should be without this live album. It is an excellent demonstration of why they were such a popular live act, and captures them playing at their peak.
0894803123|2.0|This is one of three ice cream books that I own, but I doubt I'll be making any of the recipes without one major modification -- I just have this aversion to eating raw eggs, you see.  I didn't realize that B &amp; J don't cook their ice cream base before I ordered this book.  So, unless you're absolutely, 100% certain that the eggs you're using are salmonella free, either try cooking the two base recipes that call for eggs (a third doesn't call for eggs)or try another book.  And really, making a cooked custard base for ice cream is NOT difficult.  You'll have to wait several hours longer for your treat (20 minutes to cook the custard and a few hours to chill it thoroughly) but hey, that gives you time to hit the gym for a hard workout to burn off the calories in advance. And you'll end up with a creamier, superior product in the end.  If you really don't feel you have the time or skill to cook the base, you're probably better off finding a B &amp; J's shop somewhere.  If you do, by all means experiment with cooking and post your results here, or maybe try the Williams-Sonoma ice cream book.  For really decadent ice cream, go for Nigella Lawson's Endless Summer book -- it's a general cookbook, but has an entire chapter devoted to ice cream (the vanilla is particularly heavenly...)
B00005IC2H|5.0|This CD is gorgeous. I'm a painter, so often, I find myself searching for that catalyst to help the images flow. Really, the stuff I get from Sigur Ros and their album....it's transcendental. So, do art. I also reccomend listening it when you're in one of those ever to frequent pensive moods. it helps, which is strange because sometimes slow and emotion-packed songs can make things seem worse, but this album is soft and calming. like the presence of an angel near you. I've never seen so many cry in one place as I did when I saw them in concert. It is true that some of the reviews given ( a mere minority I might add) are not positive, but this music isn't for everyone. You have to be worthy.
0783117523|5.0|This was an outstanding film of the highest quality. The acting was Oscar quality performances from start to finish. Production quality was good. The story is engaging, vivid, sexual and dark. There is full frontal nude shots so it is not a movie for the very young or very prudish. This movie pulls you in and makes you feel involved in the twisted world of a model superstar. Buy this film and add it to your collection if you like raw truth type films with a twisted sexual feel.
B0000004F9|5.0|My first ever concert going experience was seeing Jimi Hendrix at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago. There were some foul utterings by various individuals about the opening act, Soft Machine. I had no idea who they were and didn't really care. It was my first concert and it was Jimi Hendrix. <br />I don't think I coud have been more surprised when Soft Machine hit the stage. It was simply the most amazing thing I had ever seen. These guys played with total impunity to any of the norms of pop music. Calling them intense would be a drastic understatement. I was impressed by the level of musicianship throughout. This was not a garage band. That they strung their entire set together with no breaks in between songs was simply unheard of. Mike Ratledge's keyboard playing was frantic and Robert Wyatt's drumming was just as wild. Seeing these guys play a set was like having an hour long heart attack. I could see why some people might not like them. It was almost too much to take. Add on to that the fact that they weren't playing pop style music could test almost anyone's limits. This was some bizzare mixture of rock, jazz and psychedelia.<br />I immediately bought this album and wore it out. It stood up under repeated listenings. There alwayse seemed to be something new emerging from the speakers.<br />After I bought it a second time I wore it out again. I finally picked it up on CD and have been a happy camper ever since. Almost 40 years after it's initial release it still sounds great to me. The production might be a bit goofy at times but its relentless barage of crazy inventiveness is (in my book) still unsurpassed by anyone.
1400049628|4.0|I liked this book. It was a great spoof of those other &quot;worst case&quot; handbooks and a great read.
B00005JKZ3|5.0|This is a really awesome sequel to the first one and delivers it's promised goal, entertainment. <br /> This movie is about another alien creature by the name of Serleena who threatens to destroy the Earth if the Men In Black don't give it to her. The two men In Black are separated because Agent J (Tommy Lee Jones) had his memory erased after the previous events and Agent K (Will Smith) now has to revive his old memories in order to save the Earth from destruction. <br /> This is a really fun sequel and is a DVD that is worth buying!! The extras are great as well!
0446310786|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of my favorite novels.  The author, Harper Lee, takes readers to the roots of human behavior:  kindness &amp; cruelty, love &amp; hatred.<BR>   The story takes place in a small Alabama county.  The main characters are a brother &amp; sister named Jen &amp; Scout--and their father named Atticus Finch. Their mother had died when the kids were younger.  They also have a friend named Dill.  The kids have lots of things happen to them. Down the street there is a house that looks deserted.  All the kids call it the &quot;Radley House&quot;.  They think a guy named &quot;Boo&quot; Radley lives in it.  So they act out skits and try to be the Radleys.  <BR>   About halfway through the novel their Dad (who is an attorney) takes up a case and defends an African-AMerican, accused of raping a local lady.  In trying to help a black, Atticus loses his reputation in the white community.  Everybody starts hating him and his kids.  But he sticks to what he believes is right.<BR>   The story climaxes when the family actually discovers the truth about 'Boo' Radley.  Likewise, the community (&amp; the reader) discovers the truth about the accused, the accuser, and themselves.  This book is a true classic.  I highly recommend it.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I can't pretend to be an old-school Cannibal Corpse fan who's followed the band loyally for over ten years. Sure, I've known about them since that movie, but never really checked out their music until just now, even though I was getting into other bands like Cryptopsy and Vader through the intervening years.  Well, we all make mistakes, right?  I have this incredible urge to go back in time and &quot;discover&quot; this band for myself sooner.  Because, as many have found out, Cannibal Corpse delivers on all levels.  <br />Most notable and obvious would be the artwork.  Their traditional vicious pictures may be disturbing to some but a closer examination reveals that no hack could draw these - they are quite good.  The music is exactly what you would expect - fast, heavy, punishing.  George Fisher turns in a fantastic performance.  I'm not sure if I like it as much as Peter from Vader, but he's a close second at least.  The string section turns in some truly amazing sequences, particularly in the title track, though impressive riffs and leads abound throughout the album.  Corpse employ advanced musical techniques without straying into the technical-for-it's-own-sake territory that bands like Cryptopsy comfortably inhabit.  They are masters of rhythmic intricacy, but they leave it to the listener to realize over several listens. The drums are a little high-end heavy; the kick drums are clear but a little thin.  I won't complain too much about that because it's a breath of fresh air from the usual trigger-off-the-radar kick sound that is death metal's trademark.  And of course, as has been mentioned in many reviews already, the songwriting is solid; and in some places, an almost-hummable (or, growl-able) hook presents itself.  <br />To cap off my long-winded rave, Cannibal Corpse is a band that I wish I had discovered much earlier, but as they say, better late than never.  I bought.  I listened.  I believe.
B000002B7U|4.0|The Ultimate Sin has become the forgotten album in Ozzy Osbourne's extensive solo output. He hasn't performed any songs off the album live in many years and not one track is represented on The Essential Ozzy Osbourne album. However, this is easily his most underrated album and along with No More Tears is his best studio work since the death of Randy Rhoads.<br />Several of the tracks here are very strong with the best being &quot;Killer Of Giants&quot;, &quot;Secret Loser&quot;, and the should have been hit single &quot;Shot In The Dark.&quot; This album was recorded at the height of the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and his lyrics on the political tracks &quot;Killer Of Giants&quot; and &quot;Thank God For The Bomb&quot; are among the best of his solo albums. Jake E. Lee's guitar work continues to impress and his killer riffs highlight the tracks &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; and &quot;Never.&quot; Other strong tracks here include &quot;Never Know Why&quot; and the title track. Randy Castillo's playing is also outstanding here and his drums are way up in the mix, similar to Kiss' Creatures Of The Night album but not as heavy. Unlike some of his other post-Rhoads albums like Bark At The Moon, No Rest For The Wicked, and Ozzmosis, there is absolutely no filler here and &quot;Shot In The Dark&quot; and especially &quot;Killer Of Giants&quot; are among his best solo work. Fans who discovered Ozzy after his hit &quot;Mama, I'm Coming Home&quot; or much later with his reality show The Osbournes should check this out.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Like all of Radiohead's releases since OK Computer, this album is overrated.  While not bad by any means, people should actually listen to this album instead of taking critics' opinions as gospel.  This band is a critic's darling, let's be honest.  They could tell ghost stories on an album, and critics would consider it groundbreaking.
B0001AP12G|5.0|One of the Top 5 Debut Hip-Hop albums ever!
B0000A36J5|5.0|I am a Tolkien fan; Lord of the Rings is the best book I have ever read, therefore I hate all the changes Jackson decided to make. Why make changes, when the story is already good? Why make changes that will not improve the story? But even saying so, I think this movie is a great one, and this dvd set the best. How can I think both things at the same time? Let me explain myself. First of all, as I have said I am a Tolkien fan, and that means for me that The Lord of the Rings is primarily a book. The great memories and moments I have had with middle-earth come from the books by professor Tolkien. There are today many LOTR fans, but they are LOTR movies fans, and there is a huge difference. That is the reason why the movies for me are just subsidiary material for the books, and I dont care too much about the changes. I dont take them too seriously. It is the same thing as when you see a Tolkien ilustrator and you dont like the picture, because you do not agree with that vision of middle-earth. The pleasure I find in the movies comes not from the hope that they will be exactly like the book, but that there are at least some images of my most beloved book on film.<BR>Having said so, lets talk about the Two Towers movie and extended edition. I will not point out the goods things which are many (the best of all is Gollum) and you already know, I would prefer to make some comments on the flaws I found. Jackson says that the books must work for people that have not read the book, lets test the movie on this ground. The extended edition is a better version, because it is a complete film. The one we saw in theatres is an editing disaster. Let me give you two examples. Aragorn is lying at a river side and a horse comes out of nowhere to pick him up. In the extended edition we learn this horse was Theodreds, that after his death it was impossible to control and that Aragorn advices to free the animal, so there existed a connection between Aragorn and the horse. Faramir tells Frodo and Sam that Boromir is dead, how does he comes to know this? (I know how because Ive read the book, but we must pretend that we are just ordinary non Tolkien readers that are in the theaters just to see a movie) In the extended edition we realize that Faramir has found Boromirs horn broken in two. Was it impossible to put a 15 second phrase in the theatrical version? So the people who have not read the book have no idea how Faramir know this.<BR>Now I want to refer to the changes between book and movie. There are many changes I can understand, and that I accept because of what I have said above. I can understand that they invented a scene of Sam falling in front of the black gates, I even like it. I can understand the flashbacks of Arwen and Aragorns romance. I dont think you need them in the movie, but it appears that Jackson, Walsh and Boyens were committed with stubborness to make Arwen a greater character than she is in the book. Anyway, I preferred the love story, which in a way is true to the book, than the original idea: we learn in the DVD appendices that Arwen was going to fight along Aragorn in Helms Deep; it seems that the internet harsh commentaries influenced the change, thank God! I can understand that they eliminated (Erkebrand) and give Eomer a different part to play in the story. I can understand that in the last battle the riders come from the east when they should have come from the west. <BR>Those changes I can understand. But I can not understand why the ents are presented like selfish beings that doesnt understand the implications of Saurons menace. Treebeard is one of the wisest characters in Middle-Earth. He knows what have to be done right after speaking with Merry and Pippin. The ents defeat Saruman and they send the uhorns to destroy Sarumans army in Helms deep. There would have not been any victory for Rohan without the Ents help. In the extended edition we see the uhorns and its role in the battle, although the sequence was a very short one: it is almost impossible to see the huorns going fron Fangorn to Helms Deep, we see Treebeard, Merry and Pippin, then the uhorns and a slight move of leaves, then Treebeard again with Merry and Pippin; I thought that they cut the scene out of the movie because of its lenght, now I dont know what to think. Was it too much to ask to put one minute of film that includes the uhorns sequences in the theatrical version? Anyway, not even the extended edition makes justice to the role the ents played in the war against Sauron. But the biggest mistake that Jacksons team made was the elimination of Shelob. Their reasoning was flawed from the beginning. Helms Deep is not the conclusion of the story, it is the central climax. The final climax is what happened in Shelobs lair. But Jackson decided to make Helms Deep the end of the story and from that decision originated all the abominations of the movie. If Frodo and Sam dont face the Shelob danger, then they have to invent one: Faramir became the opposite of what he really is. Not even the extended version presents Faramir as a disciple of Gandalf, an scholar of ancient lore, one in who the old blood of Nmenor is restored, and one who is so wise and noble that can resist the power of the ring and understand inmmediatly Frodos quest. Once you have a fake Faramir, Frodo has to go to Osgiliath and face the Nazgul, but this creates problems for the third movie: if the nazgul saw that Frodo carries the ring how is it going to be possible that Sauron thinks it is Pippin the one who carries it? If Helms Deep is going to be the last sequence, they have got to create an action scene to be in the middle of the movie: the wargs attack the rohirrim and Aragorn falls from a cliff. And after all this, there is no time to show the encounter of Gandalf and Saruman, and the finding of the Palantir. They said: that will be in the third movie; the problem is that now they think it doesnt belong there and they just cut those sequences from the Return of the King theatrical version. See Jackson what happens when you mess around with a story that doesnt need that. They try to improve it but instead they make it worse than the book. <BR>However this movie by itself is great, I love it, and the DVD set is the best one you can ever hope.
B000127LW2|3.0|This is more of a complaint than a review, since I have yet to see the whole season DVD set.  The first time I bought the package, there was no Disk 5.  However, there were two Disk 4s.  The package was returned, and I bought another package.  This one had a Disk 5, but now there are two Disk 2s and no Disk 3.  Even worse, this latest package has scratches and finger prints.  I guess I'll be making a return voyage to the store again.  Whoever is working to put these DVD packages together better get their act together.
0345446798|3.0|This book contains great information on dog behavior. The problem is that you have to wade through pages of explanations of human behavior to find out why dogs behave they way the do. It can be difficult reading, but it can also be funny and light hearted. The author has a Ph.D. and you almost need one to read this book. I am underlining the good stuff and having my husband just read that. It will save him a lot of time and headaches.
0321127420|5.0|If you've read Refactoring or UML Distilled, or Planning XP, you won't be disappointed with this Fowler book.  He's the clearest writer and thinker in the Agile/XP/Patterns group of authors.<br />The book is particularly strong in describing how to map between a persistent relational database and an in-memory object representation of business logic.  Fowler distills the various approaches to their essence, clearly presents the tradeoffs and defines an intuitive vocabulary to make it easier for development teams to discuss how the patterns apply to their unique application.<br />Highly recommended.
B000089RVX|5.0|Whooop whoop. This cd rocks. The best one I have in my collection. First of all the cover is awesome. Second, every son in this CD is extremely awesome. Thirdly, evanescene is the best band ever. They have the best combination of rock and well Amy Lee. She is so good she is in a category all her own. She, in my opinion is the best female vocalist I have ever heard. And with Ben Moody backing her up on guitar. What a combo. If you were allowed to put your own number of stars I'd put like infinity stars. Whooooooop Whooooop :) :).
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I am confused by the 3 star rating amazon.com customers have given Lost in Translation (3 stars as of 2/27/04).  I have spoken to many individuals regarding this movie and have found no one who described it as anything less than amazing.  In fact, many have seen the movie more than once in order to continue their exploration of Ms. Coppola's fantastic characters.  The plot of the movie is very simple; this does not equate boring.  The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is not a traditional Hollywood romance but stands above the solely physical interraction seen in many movies.  These characters are in fact &quot;lost&quot; and find comfort in their foreign surroundings through one another.  Please see this movie.  Do not expect fisticuffs or passionate love scenes.  Expect an honest portrayal of loneliness and the true comfort one can find through contact with another in a like situation.  Again, please see this movie.  5 stars is not enough.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|Notre-Dame de Paris is a masterpiece. I first had the opportunity to hear the music in my High School French class. My parents both speak French fluently so I have grown up around it, but I never realized how beautiful the language really is! Garou's performance as Quasimodo was wonderful and now I am hooked on &quot;Seul&quot; (if you haven't heard it, you really have to!). The music is deep and moving. Even if you don't understand French it is still beautiful. It pulls you into the story and creates a great atmosphere. <br />The musical is also amazing to watch. The movement is incredible and the vocals are indescribable. This CD is worth every penny!!!! Enjoy it!!!! Listen to the sample tracks and you will fall in love with it, just as I have! C'est magnifique!<BR>And to quote the musical itself, &quot;C'est celui pour qui mon coeur bat!&quot; (&quot;It is the one for whom my heart beats!&quot;) Au revoir!
B00008PW2D|4.0|Ok, granted it was a little expensive for only 8 episodes--BUT if you are a true SATC fan, then you need to have it.  The episodes were great in my opinion.  They were all so touching!  I love this season just like all of the others, I just wish it was longer!
B00000293E|5.0|Who knows how different the history of music as we know it would be like without this genius.  Every blues musician since and many classic rock bands owe him a huge debt.  This is a must for any music collection.

B00000425L|5.0|Hi,<br /><br /> Rachmaninov's complete preludes haven't been recorded so often...Ashkenazy's were the first to appear on Cd,  with the excellent recording further enhanced...this is superb flair and panache about this playing..As a bonus, the compact disc offer the second piano sonata...with Ashkenazy generally following the 1913 original score but with some variants. He plays with great vituosity and feeling, and the result is a beautiful recording...Buy this one without thinking for a second...<br /> M. Can EL
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Yes, they do.. <br />After each episode knowing that Firefly is no more.. <BR>(Hope the movie will bring this AMAZING, and I repeat AMAZING show back.)<br />The quality is astounding, the acting is superb and the show is the best sci-fi ever!!! (Sorry Farscape, we at least got 4 seasons....And more to come!!)<br />Buy, rent, steal(please don't), borrow, whatever to get this DVD..<br />I showed it to my friends.. And they also just love it, and that was just the pilot. <BR>Never seen a show that got me hooked after just the pilot.. <BR>And it just gets better after each episode.. <br />FOX... WHY.. WHY.. WHY.. Ok, so you canceled the show.. So you were wrong.. It happens.. Just get it back.. <br />PLEASE.. Pretty Please ?? <br />Sigh..........
B00005JMFI|4.0|Can someone please explain to me why this hasn't at least been giving a release date for DVD yet. I mean this movie has been out there forever.
B000127LW2|3.0|Another very disappointing packaging effort by Paramount. I suggest that they have a look at the wonderful packaging of the Babylon 5 series sets and get it right.<BR>This ST:Voyager set comes in a flimsy plastic box and you have to take the plastic top off and then take the plastic bottom off to get at the DVD's.This leaves the set open to dust and(unless you have three hands)you must put both plastic parts down to remove a DVD and then put these three bits back together.Truly terrible packaging!<BR>The DVD picture of the series is eccellent and it was interesting to see the Bujold footage. She was obviously too old for the role and her French accent grates a bit. What Rick Berman doesn't mention is that he made the huge mistake of giving Bujold the role without an audition.<BR>The DVD of the season is good but they need to correct the awful packaging.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Like most people, I've seen poorly edited versions of this film with poor visibility. This one, while not complete, gives you a better understanding of the story than most versions. However, indications from this film are that the original version contained too many confusing subplots and bogged down the tale. In either case, this is clearly the best version of Metropolis I've seen. Both firstime viewers and fans of the film are in  for a revelation.
B00018HU4U|1.0|Good marketing, Good product positioning, Good product launch, ... BAD CD.  It doesn't even deserve to be on the top 100, not to mentioned being the best selling album!!!<br />I bought both her CD's just to find out what people were talking about, and after listening to it three times, I have retired it to my coaster section.  She has a good voice, but every song on both CD's sounded too much alike, making it a touture to listen to both CD at the same time.  Before you go out and buy this, borrow it from a friend who has it, and if you can listen to it more than twice and like it, than buy it, otherwise, save your money, or buy any of Diana Krall's CD instead.
B00008WT49|4.0|I have to agree with the others - the SACD analog mix in 5.1 was a blunder(4 stars).  I borrowed this from a friend for a test run.  I have the same content on DVD/video - Very nice... - When I choose to listen only - I just turn off the TV and listen to a very good 5.1 DD/EX version.  I admit it is not quite the quality of SACD but very good nonetheless.  Spyro Gyra has 2 SACD's available and they are the standard for SACD comparison - absolutely flawless...  Waiting for 2 of my all-time favorites on SACD - Eat a Peach and Live at the Fillmore from the ABB...  SACD is just a small notch above DVD-Audio - although with DVD-Audio you can also listen on most any DVD player that supports DTS, DD-5.1 and DD-Stereo.  SACD's are more dicriminating - I bought the Onkyo DVSP-800 specifically because of the SACD and DVD-Audio discrete analog and outstanding DVD-progressive scan video capabilities...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Many critics are still in the process of absolving Sofia Coppola for Godfather III by heaping lavish praise upon Lost in Translation.  But that's not really necessary.  Coppola established herself as an excellent director with The Virgin Suicides, a film that is in fact superior to her latest effort.<br />There's plenty to admire about Lost in Translation.  Coppola has a light touch that gives her pictures a distinct atmosphere that lingers far beyond viewing.  The movie continually has the feel of watching the sun rise after you've been drunk all night, and I mean that in a good way.  Plus, any movie that showcases Bill Murray and compels Kevin Shields to begin recording music again has a lot going for it.<br />But Lost in Translation is ultimately undone by a single weakness: Nothing ever happens.  And I mean it.  There's no real plot to speak of, no major shifts in character, no progression that compels the viewer to keep on watching.  I don't mean that someone has to be shot or that people have to start hooking up all over the place.  But in a movie, something, anything, has to happen.  Otherwise, why watch?  Many people, oddly enough, find this lack of story to be a strength of the film.  I can't even begin to know why.  <br />Not that Coppola doesn't have numerous chances to construct a deeper story.  But moments that could introduce conflict (like Bill Murray's character sleeping with a lounge singer), are instead left dangling, almost as if they never happened.  And because the story doesn't really go anywhere, we don't get a chance to see the two leads characters emote.  There are lots of hangdog stares, exasperated looks around, and so forth.  But that isn't enough to keep the film together.  The end result feels slapped together, unstructured.  It was Coppola's intent to make you feel as lost and adrift as her main characters.  In that regard, she succeeds, but that doesn't mean the movie itself does.  <br />There are also some oddly juvenile bits in themovie, particularly as they relate to Japanese culture.  There are some jokes about Japanese people speaking broken English, switching R's and L's.  But these are fairly tired stereotypes (even if they are occasionally true), and it makes the situations feel forced, even contrived.<br />Lost in Translation was clearly based on real events in Coppola's life.  And while, voyeuristically, that makes it occasionally compelling, that shouldn't be the reason we're watching.  Coppola seems to have documented a portion of her life she is still unable to make sense of.  What did she learn?  How has she changed as person?  Either she didn't, or we aren't allowed to know, and that makes Lost in Translation an ultimately frustrating experience.
0312263120|1.0|Criminy, how I loathed this book. It was painfully predictable, cliched and soulless. Another Dan Brown book with a brilliant, handsome academic and his brilliant, beautiful partner solving problems no one on the planet could hope to crack. Sheesh. Although the basic plot is reasonably clever, the one-dimensional characters, banal dialogue and foregone conclusion of the book make it an irritating read. Halfway through it I was rooting for the professor to die and the end of civilization as we know it. Wasn't gonna happen, of course, but at least it might've been interesting.
0385510438|2.0|This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book.  I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.  <BR>The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.  <BR>I kept thinking the &quot;crime family&quot; resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times.  A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.  <BR>If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.<BR>Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I have been an opeth fan for only about 2 years now but, I have all of their albums. My favorite is my arms your hearse. Damnation is just an album depicting opeth's miraculous talents. This album is a soft relaxing acoustic album. Mikael's lyrics are dark, and make you think.. i mean come on &quot;blank face in the windowpane&quot; that gives you a strange image in your head. it is great. I am more of a fan of their heavier death metal sound, but i love this album too.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Well I personally think that Linkin Park are a bunch of no talent musicians. I read one of the other reviews which said that a musician with no talent can be good these days and said that music is changing and we should get used to it. Well that just shows how much musical quality is declining these days. When someone who is no good at what they do &quot;playing their instrument&quot; can get rich. Also the rapper in this band sounds exactly the same in every song, which makes it a little boring. Also i would have put no stars if i could but that option wasnt available.
B000008M1P|5.0|their albums are the greatest and they need to be out so they can be gotten easier i always liked the music since the first time i heard it and now want to get it but its hard to find
B00018D44U|4.0|OldFaht doesn't care much for country music or music produced by people under 50 (go Stones!). But OldFaht likes the music of Norah Jones. He listens to her new CD while tapping at his computer, endlessly trying to sort out his Medicare claims (BTW, OldFaht may be old, but he's not senile - doesn't click the &quot;Install Now&quot; button when the &quot;BandLink&quot; installation window pops up after the CD is inserted in his PC - unlike some of the previous reviewers who were outraged at the spyware that stealthily crept from the CD to their hard drives). OldFaht doesn't know squat about Norah Jones (and prefers it that way, lest his illusions be shattered) but he thinks he hears a sweetly innocent and sincere young woman tastefully singing simple songs that go straight to the heart. He finds this music comforting and poignant, and he wishes there were a lot more of it around.
0156027321|5.0|My book club was thinking of reading this one for April so I picked it up at the book store.  What a ridiculous plot for a story: A boy and a bengal tiger, trapped on a lifeboat, no less.  Yeah, sure.  The author's bio said that he washed dishes???  What kind of blather was I getting into, I thought?<br />I can honestly say that everything I thought about it was wrong.  I was so mezmerized that I read it in ONE day.  (well, hey, I am unemployed!)  I love a good adventure story and I love metaphor, symbolism, a book that makes me think, etc., etc., etc.  You can read this as an adventure story, or you can read it as a parable.  I simply could not put it down.  This book is at once profoundly spiritual, hilariously laugh-out-loud funny, deeply religious and heartbreakingly tragic.  I cried desperately during the horrible storm, wondering if poor Richard would make it, saying out loud, Please, God, save Richard!  I felt like a little child clapping for Tinker-Belle in Peter Pan.  With all the books that I have read in my life, I rank this book in the top 10.<br />For young people, this is an excellent story of a child surviving by his wits.  For adults entering the world of contemporary lit, what a lovely introduction it is!  For those of us who just love a well written book, with beautiful descriptions, perfection!  How can I ever forget the colorful descriptions of the animals in the zoo?  The lucious fruits?  The trees of the forests?  And the colors!  The hilarious meerkats!  Masterfully written, exotic and not exotic.<br />The parable of Kishna and the Maidens is so powerful it is overwhelming.  Keep this parable in mind as the life aboard the boat begins to unfold.  Gandhi is quoted as saying, \\"All religions are true.\\"  Amen, great teacher, Amen!<br />I will remember Richard in his loneliness all my life, (just as I will remember Frodo and Jane Eyre and Black Beauty and Beautiful Joe and numerous other charecters that time and space do not permit here whom I havemet in my literary journeys).  I still cry for him.  I will come back to this one again and again to learn more of the lessons written therein, just as I have re-read the Tolkien books.  A masterpiece, it deserves every literary award it can get.  Priceless & profound.  Bravo, Mr. Martel, Bravo!  Thank you so very, very much from the depth of my heart for Pi and for Richard.  They are a gift.
0385512104|4.0|I am always overly sentimental about books set in England because I lived there for many years myself. I love the little nuances that I 'get' that maybe someone who's never lived there wouldn't pick up on. Haddon not only gave me the gift of a English local but a great story as well. It has a quick, easy and fairly light feeling considering the issues raised. But most importantly I think a light has been placed upon someone with autism in a more flattering direction. It doesn't have to be all Dustin Hoffman RainMan all over again. We take this journey with Christopher and learn how bewildering things can be through his eyes. Yet, being a teenager is bewildering on its own and we all can relate to that.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album showcases all the musical sides of Dream Theater.  Disc 1 contains 5 brilliant yet completely different progressive tracks and Disc 2 contains the 42 minute epic title track, immense!
0375703861|3.0|This book had a huge amount critical acclaim attached to it. Smith, herself, became a literary darling overnight it seemed. I actually didnt read this book until much later after that hype died down. I really only have one resounding feeling about the book - it is extremely hard to follow Smith's direction if you haven't live in a multi-cultural melting pot. I read reviews of people in middle America saying they didn't see what all the bother is about - and they wouldn't. Having said that, even if you don't see the bigger picture she is trying to convey, the general storyline falls short.
B00005JLR8|3.0|The Sheridiens are impressive script writers, their sketch of an Irish couple living through the pitfalls and triumphs of a family is very well done. To complement that perfectly, the acting and direction do complete justice to the perhaps deliberately soft theme. If the intent of this movie was to create a pointless tale of a couple of ordinary folk with two very nice and mature children, they succeeded admirably.<br />But it is a bit difficult to want to squander two hours of one's time watching dull depressing lives of people who create their own problems and can't overcome a tragedy.<br />What underscores the mediocrity of the film is that Sheridien never seemed to have made up his mind about whether he wanted to make a Ken Loach film set in New York, showing nakedly the circadean roughness of urbanscapes and the crushing of the American Dream, or a Steven Spielberg film complete with children, magic, the power of a family to stay united and general happiness and good will. Having a foot on each shore, in falls flat in the middle.<br />Recommended rental for a slow evening but I'd think twice before singing paeans to it.
B00018TI5E|4.0|Mr. Frusciante has had three albums prior to this release and while I've only had the opportunity to hear the most recent, I can safely say this is his best work.<br />Anyone expecting to hear music like that of the Red Hot Chili Peppers will be sorely disappointed, but I'm glad this CD isn't like their work. This music is deeper and more thoughtful; even ambient. Only a few songs such as &quot;Second Walk&quot; showcase guitar-work we are familiar with from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Fortunately the rest of the album lets us hear a side of Mr. Frusciante most of us weren't aware of. Almost every song is flavored with acoustic guitar and synthesizer overlays. There are also three experimental instrumentals that you will either love or hate. Regardless, they are very interesting from a musical point of view and comparable to the work of Radiohead or Pink Floyd's instrumental tracks.<br />This album gets 4/5 stars because, while it is amazing, some out of place tracks could have been clipped in order to make it a shorter listen. Otherwise, this is a winner.
B00003CX9E|3.0|If you don't mind a black and white print and savor crisp dialogue, this movie is undoubtedly a collector's item. But I am not sure if it has aged well enough to be exalted to the level of the greatest movie of all time or anything, especially for non-American audiences.<br />The theme veers around a (typical) rich guy who was born with a silver spoon, then gagged on it with his egotistical empire of yellow journalism, and made a spectacular, stylish mess of his life. The plot line is thus simple and predictable, the acting very convincing but not legendary. There are several quotable quotes, which may interest some viewers. Around the middle the movie exhibits a bit of chaff, long scenes where very little purposeful happens.<br />Yet, the artistic value along with some of the &quot;scandal&quot; involved in Citizen Kane (semblance to the real life of William Hearst) is what made it a classic years later. If it is believed that this film was a trailblazer in cinematography, I can absolutely see why. It sports a dazzling kaleidescope of amazing lighting tricks and innovative camera angles (e.g., having the camera on the floor).<br />Yet, is it THE best movie ever made? Many reviewers here seem to have said exactly that, but my enthusiasm is more restrained.<br />It remains a highly recommended rental though. If you like your DVD collection, this is one you'd even want to buy..
0345457684|5.0|Hey All<BR>I bought this book simply for the publisher and the fact that it was a &quot;First novel&quot;. It is an original work. I urge you not to read anything about it as it will ruin the suprise as well as the novelty of the &quot;world&quot; where Altered Carbon takes place. <br />That being said, I must warn you - dear reader - When you fall in love and wish to buy more of this &quot;world&quot; do not fall into the trap. Stay away from &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. It is bad and will soil the memory of Altered Carbon. There can be no sequel. This book is uniqe.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|If the goal was to give the audience a snapshot of the hard life at sea then I guess it accomplished its intentions perfectly.<br />The battle scenes are gruesome and loud (the way they should be, i.e.) and the visuals in general are gripping. The whole feel of the life on board with the old salty dogs came across pretty well.<br />Sadly, it seems the scriptwriter for this wannabe war opus plot was on the sets -- at sea. There were times in the movie where absolutely nothing was happening, there were no unresolved issues and no reason to be watching. I got bored and I saw Russell just acting too hard with that one look that he is capable of -- the one with angst and disdain. Plus, the movie is really looong.<br />Maybe a worthy rental for guys who like battle scenes or for sailors etc. Not much else to say about it.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I Got College Dropout as a gift. I didn't really want it because i thought Through the Wire was the most annoying song out &amp; Slow Jamz sucked even more, but when i listened to the whole album, it turned out to be pretty good. I've had it for almost a week &amp; I'm starting to get tired of it though. The best thing about Kanye himself is that he actually talks about things of substance (unlike Cash Money, etc), especially in Jesus Talks &amp; he's not afraid to speak his mind.<br />There's too many skits on the album. If you like skits, you won't mind, but they are uselss &amp; not all that funny. You buy it &amp; think there's 20 tracks. No. But there's a good number. <br />Theres lots of guests on the album (Jay Z, Mos Def, etc) &amp; they're all good. He's a great producer, &amp; with this album he shows hes a pretty good rapper himself. OVERALL :  BUY THIS ALBUM.<br />Top 5: <br />5) We Don't Care<BR>4) Never Let Me Down<BR>3) Two Words<BR>2) All Falls Down<BR>1) Spaceship
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation is the closest look one can get to the way Japan isolates and keeps foreigners on the outside without actually visiting the country itself.  After living in a very modern Japan for seven months, I found the film full of the moments that make daily life here seem quite dream-like and surreal sometimes.  The film is tasteful and sweet in its portrayal of Japan to an outsider and much more honest and accurate than films such as The Last Samauri or Kill Bill.  If you are at all interested in seeing Japan the way that it really is for a gaijin (the Japanese word for foreigner - literally translating as &quot;outsider&quot;) visiting the country, this film is dead on.
B00018D44U|5.0|I disagree with other reviewers i thought that it is an excellent follow on from her debut album &quot;come away with me&quot;. i'll admit that i did think that it was quite different but thats good because more of the same would have been boring and would have shown no developement of her as a artist. i love this album just as much as her last one and would highly recommend it to buyers
B0000C9V3T|4.0|for some reason on this disk there is no song, which sounds after battle from Oren, and song, with which concludes the film. They the best, but for some reason here there are not.
0440238153|2.0|I read the HDM Trilogy in one go and enjoyed it.  Sadly however, the quality and inventiveness decreases from book to book, whilst the preachiness increases.  I found much of the material in The Amber Spyglass to be boring, contrived or unconvincing.  For example, the Mulefa are rather silly and trite.  They don't really add much to the story and Mary is a little pointless as a charcter, despite supposedly have a big role to play.  The visit to the land of the dead is overlong and the relationship between Lyra and Will just doesn't seem real.  These are 12-13 year olds after all.  In the end, Pullman is a good storyteller, bu no Milton.
B00004STUL|2.0|Matrin Lawrence and Will Smith are 2 of the best comedians/actors alive, and they do NOT shine in this crap. Lawrence and Smith play 2 narcotics detectives who have to bring down some illegal dealarship run by (who could it be) Russians. This movies humor is gross, nasty, and oh yeah, not funny. (There is a gag where Lawrence shoves an attackers head into a full urinal). Nearly all my friends loved this movie and the sequel more, and, I will say online, that they are idiots.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Like most of Tarantino's work, he doesn't hold back. He puts people in situations that some of us that are watching it wish we'll never end up in. That's the great thing about him. He basically speaks his mind and does what other people don't have enough guts to do because they're afraid of what others may think of them as a person.Kill Bill basically takes every dark comedic moment Tarantino has to offer and injects them with steroids. From the moment the movie starts, to the cartoon segments, to the vast fight scene showing Uma Thurman as a Warrior Princess that should not have been messed with. There was not one dull moment in the movie, and for the viewers that found one, Tarantino made up for it in the following scene. <br />How many Kung Fu movies have there been? A vast majority of fighting movies are Kung Fu. Tarantino is a classic director. He took what he likes from others films. He took the best part of it and molded it into his own. I hear every now and then people say he's a rip off and he copies everyone. If that's the case then every single director except the very first one to have ever existed is a copy cat. That's what makes a director, taking what you like, putting yourself into it and making it your own. <BR>Just when you think he'll let you put your head above water and come up for some air, he pulls you back down and shoves some more of it in your face. And the best part is. Some scenes in here people are afraid to admit they like because of what others might think. But if Tarantino did the same thing, there would be no Kill Bill.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|This movie is a good one, but it is a bit overrated. I saw this a week after seeing Warner Bros. \\"The Last Samurai\\", which I thought was ultimately better. Russell Crowe and Willem Defoe are good as capt. Jack Aubrey and his best friend and 1st mate, but Tom Cruise's performance as Nathan Algren in Samurai is more heartfelt and inspired and Ken Watanabe's as Katsumoto is one of the best I've seen. Director Peter Weir makes this movie enjoyable. But Edward Zwick makes Samurai a fascinating, emotional, and thrilling experience. How this movie got 10 oscar nominations and Samurai got 4 I don't get, I think it should be vice versa.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween Is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. This film introduces the classic maniacal killer Michael Myers. With great thrills and chills Halloween is sure to give you the scare you are craving for.
B0000024JN|5.0|I listen to a lot of different music, ranging from Slayer to Sublime, and have never really been much of a fan of rap or rap-rock.  But before there were bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit, there were the Beastie Boys, and &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; is the album that catapaulted the three Brooklyn white rappers to phenominal success.  Mixing hard rock riffs and furious raps, this album contains the classic party anthem &quot;Fight For Your Right&quot;, along with radio staples &quot;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&quot; (featuring Slayer's Kerry King on guitar) and &quot;Brass Monkey&quot;.  &quot;Rhymin &amp; Stealin&quot; and &quot;She's Crafty&quot; find the group sampling Led Zeppelin, while &quot;Girls&quot; and &quot;Paul Revere&quot; are hilarious.  Produced by legendary producer Rick Rubin (Slayer, Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers), the Beastie Boys have pretty much disowned all their older material, which is a shame considering how excellent this album is, and how fresh it still sounds nearly 20 years after it's release.
B00000JGHM|5.0|The benchmark for all heist movies.  Thats all that needs to be said.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I agree with Christopher....he hit the nail on the head when he said their songs were masterpieces.  I saw them in concert and I was blown away by their greatness.  Seeing them live only confirms in the absolute level of genius they possess.  What do these editorial reviewers want?  Just because there is rapping,  automatically they are compared to Limp Bizkit, which is laughable.  At times they remind me of 3-11 but they have their own sound overall.  So the albums sound similar, duh they are the same band.  You can't fault a band for having the same signature sound.  How much more different can you sound without going into a whole other genre of music(ie Outkast)?  Every song on HT and Meteora rocks, some admittedly more than others, but you can't say that about a lot of the mindless tripe that gets churned out every year.  I get verklempt when I hear the haunting Crawling, or The End....and when I heard Lying from You and Breaking the Habit at the show, I went home and immediately listened to all the other tracks, since I have the bad habit of only listening to the hit singles.  They are simply outstanding.  I can't give this band enough accolades.  You really have to have no appreciation for music itself to deny LP the kudos they deserve.
1402532903|5.0|Susie Salmon, a 14 year old victim of a serial killer tells her tale from her personal heaven and this is one of the most imaginative tales I ever read. She spends much of her time exploring the nature of heaven, though paradoxically, her true idea of heaven is just to be alive and with her family and friends, be able to grow up and enjoy life.  She wants to follow lives of people she knew.  This is a tale of horror told without hate or bloody details.  On the contrary, it is full of love and humor.  Of cause, the narrator, Alyssa Bresnahan deserves the best possible marks.  Her performance is outstanding. <br />This is one of these books you cannot put down.  You know the end,but you want to get there at a slow pace and make sure that the end is the right one.  I think this book is one of the best books written in a long while.
0375703861|4.0|As a writer, Zadie Smith deserves all of the accolades she receives. In writing &quot;White Teeth,&quot; Smith brings together great prose, social savvy, a sense of humor, and encyclopedic knowledge of British colonial history, several religions, and pop culture. The result is an ambitious and often humorous novel about two generations of two socially marginal families (one immigrant, one racially mixed) in lower middle class London.<br />The scope of the novel is epic, and Smith leaves no stone unturned as she undertakes a meaningful exploration of the lives of at least ten incredibly disperate characters who all suffer from the same fatal flaw -- a willingness to give up anything for a single (character-specific) principle. Despite its breadth, every detail in &quot;White Teeth&quot; ends up mattering, all roads lead to the same place, and I'm left wondering how a 23-year-old Smith had the wisdom and maturity to compose such a well thought out first novel.<br />As a smart, witty, hip, detailed novel, &quot;White Teeth&quot; is the type of work that would normally blow me away. While I am incredibly impressed by Smith, I felt sometimes that &quot;White Teeth&quot; was a little long and that there were a few too many important characters. The story works, but the reader gets stretched so thin among the gaggle of scheming Londonites that it's hard to maintain sympathy for any of them. When I got to the last chapter and realized Smith had only 18 pages to resolve the tangled web she wove, I knew I was going to walk away a little disappointed.  <br />Still, this novel is a good read. It's thought provoking, yet entertaining. Deep, but accessible. &quot;White Teeth&quot; is not perfect, but it is definitely one of the best books of 2000. If you have a decent attention span and a lot of free time, you should give it a shot.
B00006879E|5.0|I'm late hearing about this band but I was hooked when I saw the video for &quot;This Love.&quot;  When I heard &quot;Harder to Breathe,&quot; I figured the CD was probably worth buying.  I waited until I saw/heard them on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;  The true test of any band is whether they can perform live.  These guys sounded GREAT live.  I was taken aback.  The next day, I bought the CD and played the it over and over.  What was even better is that there is a live version of one of their songs, &quot;Not Coming Home,&quot; on the CD.  The song is absolutely fabulous.  It has instantly become one of my favorites along with &quot;Harder to Breathe,&quot; &quot;This Love,&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning.&quot;  You would never know it's live if it weren't for the audience.  Adam Levine's voice has a lot of soul in it.  That's what gets you. I'm hooked.  If you are and avid lover of music, this is a must have.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|What did I miss in this movie that the critics thought so highly of it? This movie was like watching two people wandering across a desert dying of thirst! This movie proves that critics have as much credibility as weather forcasters. This movie stunk, rent the Care Bears instead!
0380789019|4.0|As long as you don't expect to be wowed by this little fantasy, I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile way to spend an afternoon.  The characters are nicely realized, the plot is engaging, and Gaiman is a master of dreaming up delightful, oddball creatures and goosebump-inducing villains.  The plot twists were, at times, dissapointing....but that hardly takes away from the overall value of the story.  Gaiman's just too darn good at what he does to let any minor mishaps detract much from the quality of his storytelling.<br />Highly reccomended reading....and I beg you to check out Gaiman's other work as well.
0385504209|4.0|This is a very well written mystery which contains all the aspects of current conspiracy and murder on the stage of the most ancient mystery. 'The Last Temptation of Christ,' 'The Last Supper,' 'King of Kings' notwithstanding, Dan Brown is really on safe ground here. I mean, we can't even puzzle out the shot from the grassy knoll fifty years ago. How could we possibly unravel clues lost for two thousand years in the sands of antiqity over Christ's human life?<br />Mr. Brown presents a murder in the Louvre that takes the characters across three continents to a violent conclusion, with nothing really lost or gained.<br />If we thought we would know more at the end then we knew at the beginning, we are happily, I suppose, disappointed. Mr. Brown through Robert Langdon conjures up a remarkable story, but those critical of the church and those supportive of the church fail to uncover any more grist for their mills. And that's the beauty of Brown's writing. He takes a story we all heard at varying points of our adolescence, presents it beautifully, and keeps our attention throughout. It really is, forgetting the topic, a very compelling story.<br />Worth the effort. Larry Scantlebury
0385504209|3.0|While it's certainly engaging, it's definitely not satisfying.  Sure, it's a page-turner that you'll probably read in a week, but in hindsight you'll realize that the author merely took a bunch of interesting conspiracy theories and mysterious facts and figures and sewed them all together in a kind of conspiracy tapestry.<br />You start by taking the main conspiracy theory, namely the Priory of Scion/Mary Magdelene/Knights Templar theory, then you tie in a mysterious cult, namely Opus Dei (which is seems REALLY out of place, if you think about it), sprinkle on some interesting factoids, IE the Golden Ratio PHI, various forms of cryptography, etc.<br />Then you realize how Hollywood the whole book is.  Reading the plot for one of Dan Brown's other books (Angels and Demons . . . Order of the Illuminati . . . OooOOoohhHh) I realize that this guy makes a living writing these &quot;conspiracy tapestries&quot;.  Trust me, it's must more interesting reading about these conspiracy theories from legitimate non-fiction books, or watching History Channel specials, then reading them from Dan Brown.
B00004Z459|2.0|The word &quot;musicians&quot; is kind of stretching it. I used this term to describe the band in a review of Meteora:<br />&quot;Whiney, corporate-created Top 40 pop-rock.&quot;<br />That's all LP is. Don't believe me? You may as well listen to the songs. The lyrics. &quot;Everything you say to me takes me one step closer to the edge, and I'm about to break.&quot; ... &quot;This is the last smile that I'll fake for the sake of being with you&quot; ... &quot;Crawling in my skin, these wounds, they will not heal.&quot;<br />1) Give me a break from this emo crap. LP, you guys are filthy rich, and have everything you've ever wanted. Stop writing such crybaby crap. <BR>2) For God's sake, take some music lessons and learn to play your instruments.<BR>3) Learn to write a song that does not go: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, break, chorus<br />Maybe if these guys grew up a little, ditched the aleady-dying rap-rock, and wrote something more than a 3 minute bitchfest about a breakup, I might give them another try.<br />I will say this, however. Chester has a pretty good voice. He could really be the frontman of a better rock band than this. The only reason I gave the record 2 stars was because of the outro on Papercut ...
B0001611DI|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is the best zombie film ever made. I cannot imagine anything else that influenced the zombie genre/cult more than the dead trilogy.<br />There is something interesting about being trapped and having nowhere to go or not knowing where to go next. That is the essence and horror of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead. The characters have to deal with what they have left in a world that has become chaotic and very much unpredictable. What they only have left is self-preservation--to seek for safety and refuge away from the walking dead. The characters finally find their refuge in a shopping mall and for a while the shopping mall seemed like a perfect haven until the characters begin to feel that what they have is basically a prison in itself. The shopping mall with all its materials, money, food, and entertainment is ultimately nothing in the end. <br />The dead walks surrounding the shopping mall: \\"They're us...they remember what they use to do\\". There is a hidden intelligence in Dawn of the Dead. Romero is commenting on America's consumerism. As consumers, (or zombies, or sheep) we try to fill up the unconscious that hovers us like a cloud--that is boredom and emptiness; therefore, we need to fill up this emptiness and the easiest way is to buy and have materials. The materials are in itself nothing, which is what the characters ultimately find themselves in.<br />Well enough of my crazy analysis and interpretation. The point is that this film rocks! This is an intelligent horror film that is serious and sometimes funny. The actors are believable and flawless when compared to other horror films. Although Dawn of the Dead is already considered a classic, as decades pass it will definitely receive more consideration and respect. <br />However, I strongly disapprove of the remake. A Dawn of the Dead remake, which is superfluous, is either made as an appreciation of a classic or for a hollywood cash bomb. I would like to think the former but I know that is not true.
B000099T2L|3.0|I think Beyonce has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard and she's very talented but this cd is not as good as it could have been. The CD is good up until you get to track number 8, then the quality of the CD decreases. I love &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, &quot;Naughty girl&quot;, &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, &quot;Me, myself and I&quot;, &quot;Be with you&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;Dangerously in love&quot;. The rest of the songs are not that great, she could do better. I expected every track in the CD to be amazing but songs such as &quot;Hip hop star&quot; make you want to skip them. I would still recommend this CD. I believe Beyonce is capable of making an album where every song is a hit but she probably didn't take the time to make sure her CD was the best release of 2003.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This multi-DVD set is worth every penny.  Although you are paying a bit more than the theatrical release DVD - you gain so much more insite to the Two Towers...<br />As for the movie itself...obviously it is amazing.<br />I highly recommend purchasing the directors platinum series edition over the theatrical release edition - you'll be missing out if you don't.
B00018TI5E|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for quite sometime and it has surpassed my expectations. His past albums have shown a hint of his brilliance both lyrically and in composition; this album confirms it. I gladly give this album a five because like has been said before, it has great playablitity. Every song has it's showcase of John's multiple talents. Not only has the quality of the music itself improved, but his voice is much more professional now. One more thing, some reviews have said it does not sound like RHCP, but I think this album clearly shows his musical and creative contribution to the band.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has a voice unlike any other.  She is a very talented girl - I did not buy her first album...but 'Stripped' seemed different, so I thought I'd take a chance.<br />It's a very well developed album.  She addresses issues in her life, that are touching - and important.<br />She has a style of her own.  I highly recommend this album - for people who don't want bubble gum pop music sound, but quality well developed music.

Even now in the U.S.  <BR>All the singles released are very catchy - and have some great remixes available to DJs for dance clubs.<BR>It seems as though Kylie really stretches her talent on this CD.

B00006RCOB|3.0|This was Clint Eastwood's second dip into the waters of the espionage thriller (the first was the awful \\"Eiger Sanction\\" back in 1975), and one of the few films he directed which relies heavily on visual effects. As a director, Eastwood seems uneasy with both modes, which go against the grain of his realistic, tough, and often stoic &amp; silent directorial style. Nonetheless, \\"Firefox\\" works better than it should. Eastwood brings understated realism to what might have been a hopelessly hokey Cold War techno thriller, and the visual effects-laden last third is fairly exciting. However, the mixture of elements ultimately produces only an adequate film, a strange entry in Eastwood's long string of hits.<br />The plot is a Tom Clancy story before there were Tom Clancy stories (this is based on a novel by Craig Thomas). The Soviets (remember them?) have developed a super fighter jet, the Firefox, with thought-controlled weapons system. The Firefox threatens the balance of power in the Cold War, so NATO needs to get their hands on it, pronto. The only man who can do it is pilot Mitchell Gant (Eastwood). He speaks fluent Russian, can infiltrate the base with the help of Russian Jewish dissenters (played by Ronald Lacey, Nigel Hawthorne, and Warren Clarke), and has the skill to fly the Firefox. Only problem: Gant is highly unstable from his Vietnam experience, is prone is nasty flashbacks (a problem if you're flying a though- controlled plane!), and has done no undercover work before.<br />\\"Firefox\\" is overlong at 136 minutes, and tends to drag with far too many scenes of Russian and NATO boardroom arguments. The film works best in the early parts during the scenes with Lacey, Hawthorne, and Clarke, who all give fine, sentimental performances as double agents who know they are doomed but struggle on for what they know is right. In a few place, Eastwood shows traces of the later themes of the consequences of violence that would mature in \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Mystic River.\\" Eastwood himself is fairly good in the role, avoiding any \\"Dirty Harry\\" clichés or relying too much on his tough guy image, but he does look rather silly in his undercover disguise scenes.<br />Nonetheless, it does seem to take forever until the last third, where the Firefox tries to blaze an almost hopeless escape trail out of the Soviet Union, with another Firefox prototype on its tail. The effects (by John Dysktra of \\"Star Wars\\" fame) are zippy and fantastic, but any human element left in the film pretty much bails out at this point. Enjoy the planes, enjoy the speed, enjoy Clint just staring out the window and not moving much. It's fairly exciting, but when it's all over, you'll feel a bit let down.<br />The DVD, like most Warner Bros. discs in the Clint Eastwood Collection, looks very good, and the sound is 5.1. But also like most Warner Bros. discs in the Clint Eastwood Collection, there are no extras.
B000002MFN|5.0|'Erotica' contains some of the best Madonna songs.  Some, sure to become classics amongst Madonna favorites - 'Deeper and Deeper' & 'Rain'.<BR>At the time, this CD was overlooked due in part to Madonna's SEX book - but it's been over 10 years since then - so now perhaps people can start to focus on the music?<br />Another highlight is the CD and Artwork it self.  It contains a fantastic jewel case sleeve, with several great Madonna shots!<br />This CD sits along side of 'Ray of Light' and 'American Life' as my 3 top Madonna must own albums...worth every penny.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|SCARFACE IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE ABOUT A CUBAN IMMIGRANT WHO GETS SUCKED IN BY THE TEMPTATION OF MIAMI'S SEEDY DRUG-PEDALING UNDERGROUND. TONY MONTANA IS HIS NAME AND THE WORLD WON'T SOON FORGET HIS RUTHLESS, UNFORGIVING RISE TO THE TOP OF MIAMI'S LUCRATIVE DRUG-TRAFFICING INDUSTRY. HIS DUTIFUL SIDEKICK, MONOLO, IS INCLINED TO DO WHATEVER MONTANA TELLS HIM (AS EVIDENCE BY THE NOW-CLASSIC SEEN WHERE HIS OLD BOSS LOPEZ GETS SHOT). AND, NOT TO MENTION THIS MOVIE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE MOST IMMORTALLY MEMORABLE LINES IN ALL OF AMERICAN POP CULTURE: &quot;SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND&quot;. AN ALL AROUND FANTASTIC MOVIE (IF YOU CAN LOOK PAST THE WHOPPING 160 F-BOMBS IN THE FILM). I'M ESPECIALLY FOND OF LAST FINAL SCENCES OF THE FILM, WHERE ALL THE HITMEN INVADE TONY'S MANSION. ONE OF AMERICAN CINEMAS ESSENTIAL &quot;CULT CLASSICS&quot;.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Quite simply one of America's  top 5 films ever made. Norma Desmond is easily the most likable film villain in the history of cinema, Swanson's mesmerizing performance blows you away every time you see it. Its such a crime that she was denied the Oscar in favor of Holiday. The performances are heartbreaking, especially that of Stroheim and Olson, ( also nominated but sadly overlooked) and there is no need to mention Holden's performance, because to try to depict one of the most cynical, lovable, and tragic perfomances in film is impossible. Wilder was a genius, no questions asked, and while All About Eve was a worthy adversary, Sunset Boulevard truly deserved the Best Pic Prize due to it ACTUALLY being cinematic and not simply a filmed play. To deny yourself of at least one viewing of this film in your life would be one of the greatest exercises in deprivation. Watch it, and prepared to be astonished by that old Hollywood magic.
B00011V8CW|5.0|Finally this album has been re-released! An underappreciated work of Bowie's that is his BEST ALBUM SINCE SCARY MONSTERS!! This ablum is a great jazzy album full of great songs (Jump they Say, BTWN, Midnight Goodnight). The dvd is cool....but I wish it didn't come with the album, which ups the price. I have no problem with it, but it will divert a lot of people from buying it since not everyone can afford to shell out $30. Great album, strongly recommend you give it a try!
B000022TSH|5.0|From its opening scene to the infamous ending, (I refuse to spoil it, and shame on the reviewers who have the audacity to do so)Chinatown ranks alongside All About Eve and Citizen kane as the best screenplay ever written. The cinematography and art direction is enought to drool over, and Nicholson's and particularly Dunaway's performance are perfect examples flawless dedication to characterization. <BR>I cannot express enough in words how important it is for a person to go out and at least put effort into seeing this timeless masterpiece. It is Polanski's crowning achievement, and to this day I am baffled that it recieved only one Oscar (guess for which category), and the fact that John Huston's menacing performance was not even a contender in the supporting actor category.Nevertheless, a gem in Classic Cinema and perhaps the best film noir ever concieved. Flawless.
B000065V1V|5.0|It's incredible that someone who's been around so long put out an album of this calibur. It's definatley worth a listen, go buy it even if you're not a Bowie fan. You'll appreciate this. And if you like this, then give Reality a spin too, that one is pretty amazing as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved the show when it was on TV and was stunned when it was canceled. The blend of sci-fi and old time westerns is excellent. The entire cast blended very well together. Each has a story, and a history, and the story-telling made you want to get to know them better. I, and my daughter, were very disappointed when it was gone, but ecstatic the series came out on DVD! Soon as I found out, I HAD to have it. Fox messed up big time canceling this show. Can't hardly wait for the movie!

B00005JMJ4|4.0|In this film, Bill Murray is sublime and lost, and Scarlett Johansson convincingly intelligent, sexy and lost - and Tokyo is both their playground and prison.<br />When I first watched this film in the theaters, I'd likely have given this film a lower score. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's tense friendship, on first viewing, tends to overshadow the other marvelous aspects of this film.<br />But watching it again on DVD, and by knowing the film's resolution, I was able to fully enjoy Coppola's unique and highly accurate take on the quirky experiences of Americans in highrise Tokyo (I know, I've been there myself).<br />So, what that means is that this movie bears many repeat viewings. It's filled with so many small, beautiful, moments like when Johansson takes the bullet train to Kyoto and wanders around templea and witnesses a traditional wedding that touches her and redeems Japanese culture in her heart.<br />And this movie is hilarious, even more so if you know how true-to-life all the bizarre and hillarious cultural items are: from the garrish fey talk show, to all-night karaoke, to bizarre sex clubs, to the fact that there's a telephone in the bathroom.<br />So if you saw it in the theatre - check it out again. I think you'll like it better. If you've never seen it, why not take a chance?
B0000DD7NL|1.0|Alicia is not the worst R&amp;B singer out there. Why does she need great production from people like Kanye West.  Whitney Houston in her prime could sing over anything.  This album is not for everyone.  When people like Whitney were at their best it was hard to hate her.
B000002LND|5.0|Having been a teenager when Madonna rose to fame in the 80's, I had heard all these songs a zillion times growing up.  Adding to that, my sister had many of her albums and played them incessantly.  So when I found &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; for a song in a used CD store, I thought it would be a wise investment.  Hearing all these songs back to back to back is a revelation.  Madonna knows how to write a song!!  Songs like &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; still sound amazing today and haven't dated a minute.  Even the two new songs here, where an artist usually throws on filler, are great songs.  This is the CD that got me into Madonna in a big way.  I tend to favor her more recent material (and her amazing mixes on her CD singles), but for covering one decade with one disc, this cannot be improved on!!
B00005N83M|1.0|It's a sad world.  I noticed the people who are fans of her pathetic acting in movies like her Cd's too which happens to be the spanish population.  Let's face it she can't sing.  Whitney Houston in prime could do everything right, J. Lopez can't at all wheather acting or singing.
B00000F169|2.0|If you're a John Carpenter fan (Starman, Alien, etc.), you might be interested in seeing his early work, but if not, skip this DOG of a film.

B000089RVX|5.0|I'd like to say right here and now that I'm tired of people who write reviews without actually trying the product just to make the things they like sound good.Trust me,I know a few people who have deplored this album without even listening to it,I don't want to say any names or sound snobby but one of them did it to nearly every rock CD except his favourite,which was Linkin Park by the way(which is also a great album.And as for the people who can't actually LISTEN to the actual music without complaining so much about the lyrics...go rate a book.On to the review:<br />This album is deep beyond belief,and Amy Lee's voice makes it even more so.It is the perfect combination of a Beautiful voice and hard rock,or in some songs slow soothing music(My Immortal & Hello).Sometimes while you sit there and listen to this CD let's say when you're on the bus,it actually brings tears to your eyes with songs like hello and my immortal,and actually feel like your in another world with the rest.I'll now review every song indivually:<br />1.GOING UNDER:(8.5)One of my favourite songs on the album.Rock and the biggest example of the voice?rock examples i was talkin about..really empowering also has this slinky feel to it(Don't give me your hand this time,I'll save myselfffffff...)<br />2.BRING ME BACK TO LIFE:(7.5)gets old really fast.You probably bought the album for this song until you realized it was amazing.<br />3.Everybody's Fool:(8)Rock.Really Engroosing,plus it has a story.It's about a girl who pretends to be somebody els whom everyone likes and Amy Lee realizes that..(She Never was and never will be.)LOOOVE this song.<br />4.My Immortal:(7.5)Perfect song to turn to on those really poignant rainy beaatiful days for you.She talks about how tired she is of being so afraid and staying where her boyfriend used to live because he still haunts her.Absolutely Amazing,although it will take some getting used to before you actually get into it.WARNING:HABIT FORMING.ONE LISTEN CAN LEAD TOOVERDOSE.<br />5.HAUNTED:(8)Really Adreline triggering.Starts off with creepy vrock music sort of like Linkin Parks style,which is dark rock.with occasional sirens blaring between parts.If it was some background music for something it would be mutation into a better thing or some superhero dramatic scene!<br />6.TOURNIQUET:(9)My Favourite song on the album even thoughI'm yet to find anybody who shares this view.Captivating Rockish Sort-of emotional song.<br />7.IMAGINARY:(7)Half Rock slow chorus with opera at the end.Like everything about it,but I have to be in the mood before i could here this one<br />8.TAKING OVER ME:(9)starts slow,then the rock kicks in.the you fall into this amazing song.All the lyrics on the album are moving but if I had to give one as an example I'd choose this in first place,and if i can't I'd choose My immortal or hello.  <br />9.HELLO:(6.5-7.5)The slowest song with the least instruments.The easiest song to skip.but it is still most of my friends favourite and one of mine too.Beautiful Lyrics.If u like slow songs,this will be your mantra.I love this song,i gave it a 6.5-7.5 because not everyone is patient enough to hear it(..has anyone told you she's not breathing...?hello,I'm your head giving you someone to talk you.By the end of this song,you'll be stunned.<BR> <BR>10.MY LAST BREATH:(9)Another great Rock song.sort of like bring<BR>me to life but this is stronger.<br />11.WHISPER:(9)Hardcore rock with church opera background that concludes this album very well.I love her voice...<br />I hope this review helped
B0000CNY27|5.0|Actually, 4.8 stars, but I rounded it off, especially for such a cool film. 1997 has come and gone. Instead of Sci Fi fantasy, this film is now alternative history (a la Harry Turtledove's \\"The Guns of The South\\"). I have though, three gripes about this edition: 1) Was there any way possible to digitally splice the first 10 minutes into the current edition? After all these years, die hard fans (the ones who would purchase this edition) would not be lost as to what's up in the prologue. 2) There's an April 1994 featurette that detailed its making that was available on New Line Cinema's VHS edition of this movie and 3) I was disappointed that neither commentary track was made in the post 9/11 era. One of my reasons for purchasing it was to tap into the perspective that the Carpenter/Hill team could provide the audience in comparison with their then-futuristic (and somewhat prophetic) vision of America and the world at the turn of the century: the militarization of the police, the federalization of once local laws, the downing of the WTC (by hijacked jet liners at that),  how the government's balancing the enforcement of anti-terror laws vis a vis the rights of the citizen, and America's involvement in a world war (the War on Terror as opposed to WW III with China and the now defunct Soviet Union). A pity that Carpenter couldn't ressurect that touch for \\"Escape From L.A.\\", but then again, you can only get more movie from him when he's given less money.
B000089RVX|5.0|Ok, so by now Evanescence's popularity is divided between those who love them and those who consider them overrated. I will leave those debates to the people who follow trends. &quot;Fallen&quot; judged on a pure rock, music level is an impressive first album from a band that stands out in a landscape populated by new metal bands that only deliver the same senseless, hollow, depressive distortion. Yet &quot;Fallen&quot; IS a dark album, comparisons with groups like Rhea's Obsession are not unjustified and this is one of the first new groups to emerge in a while that know how to merge words with drama and music in the tradition of bands like The Doors. It is even fair to call &quot;Fallen&quot; a theater piece aside from just a rock album, Amy Lee always sounds like she's wandering through a rock opera and her voice is up to the task considering it soars and hits notes someone like Courtney Love can only dream of performing. &quot;Going Under&quot; opens the album with flash and sets the tone of darkness and drama. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is pure goth romanticism, to the point where you find yourself puzzled at how this group was considered a Christian band early on. Through-out the album, especially in songs like &quot;My Immortal,&quot; you can tell the band has a real sense of melody and how to produce classic melodies and tones within a metal surrounding. Amy Lee prances around like the Gwen Stefani for the goth crowd but makes herself known more with her vocal flights. Moody, the departed guitarist, does an exceptional job as well, delivering Metallica chords and never sounds like worthless distortion (too bad, considering this is probably going to be his only claim to fame). Evanescence at the end of the day deliver MUSIC and anyone with an open ear to what's new on the rock scene would appreciate what the group accomplishes in a debut album. There is hardly a weak track, and tracks that do stand as the weaker material in the album are still better than anything Disturbed has released. &quot;Fallen&quot; is a great debut and will be a popular album for years to come.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Masterpieces don't come without controversy. That is, they make bold statements, therefore they divide opinion based on personal beliefs. What audience was Madonna aiming for with American Life? The fact that she created the album with only a limited demographic in mind proves that Madonna cares less about commercial success and more about art and substance. <br />Albums like this are proof that Madonna truly wants to &quot;rule the world.&quot;  American Life is an album with melodic and lyrical substance. It is also a concept album - rare in our era of low artistic creativity, where musicians often just release self-titled discs with no meaningful intent whatsoever (think about the shallow yet critically successful American Idol finalist albums that have been put out lately).  <br />Every song on American Life was written by Madonna and Mirwais. It was not an album with songs collected by record moguls to meet every demographic's popularity contest.  All the songs have a similar message and a similar, haunting and timeless acoustic-meets-electronic sound. Those who say Madonna has lost her edge should look back at this album in ten years, and they will find something remarkably and masterfully ahead of its time.<br />I bought this album the day it came out, expecting a masterpiece. Unlike many people, I had an open mind upon approaching this project.  I wasn't expecting Ray of Light part 2, like most Madonna fans were.  With such low expectations, it's no wonder most fans were disappointed.  <br />The title track American Life was not meant to be an audience-pleasing song.  It's jarring beat was meant to represent the turbulence and discomfort with the often unaccepting American way of life. The beautiful, melodic chorus was the ideal, the heart of Madonna....of the person facing persecution from a discriminating and class-structured society. It is an angry, yet tender, song.  It is the conflict of tenderness and cruelty. Songs on American Life are sequenced to reflect this, with beautiful love ballads placed between more angry and experimental songs.  If you are open-minded to the possibilities, American Life is endless in meaning.
B00005B36H|1.0|1. Tool is not progressive music.  If they were, they wouldn't be making a hybrid of goth rock and nu-metal.<br />2. Most of you either listen to Tool a) because they're mainstream or b) because Opeth endorsed them and you're all Opeth d**kriders.  Face it, Opeth and Tool are both overrated bands that aren't worth the praise they get.<br />I'm sick of seeing Tool labeled as metal and being crowned as a great band.  First of all, they're American.  American bands, with one or two exceptions, are pathetic excuses for music.  Tool is in the same league as Korn and Disturbed and that waste of a band Nirvana.  In fact, Maynard James Keenan should follow in the footsteps of Kurt Cobain and kill himself.  Except Keenan should use a gun.  Then the rest of the band could take a picture of it and put it on an album cover, like Mayhem was going to do when Dead bit it.  If you like Tool, and are stupid enough to call them &quot;visionary&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; or anything other than lame and uninspired, then you have bad taste in music.  You probably listen to Justin Timberlake too.
B0000UJL96|1.0|And that's exactly what this movie, for I hesitate to honor it by calling it a film, is.<br />I grew up on Star Trek, racing home from school to ensure I got my homework done so I could watch the reruns uninterrupted.  I grasped the concepts and the allegories presented in each story and it made me think about another kind of world.  Perhaps a better one.<br />The Motion Pictures were slow at first; ST:TMP was ethereal and intellectual.  ST:TWOK was Shoot 'em up bang bang.  The series caught it's stride with ST:TSFP, combining emotionalism, intellect, and action in a mixture thoroughly enjoyable to both Trekkies and Non-Trekkies alike.<br />Then, as did the television series, it began to stumble and fall.  ST:TFF was reminiscent of a third season episode as Paramount was getting ready to close up shop on the series, and Gene Roddenberry was getting out while the getting was good.  An absurd story and poor special effects combined to make a film that was almost painful to watch.<br />The Undiscovered Country is a thinly disguised rehashing of the Cold War using the imminent collapse of the Klingon Empire due to an industrial accident on the Homeworld's moon as it's impetus.  Kirk, et al are given as a fig leaf as envoys to diplomatically solve the problem.<br />The assassination of the Klingon leader Gorkon, who is offering peace during this mission, and the ensuing Klingon Kangaroo Court places Kirk and McCoy on a Penal Colony asteroid, convicted of murder.  <br />When it is finally established that Klingon Military, led by General Chang is at the heart of the conspiracy to prevent a peaceful solution between the Federation and the Klingons by assassinating first Gorkon, then in a failed attempt, the president of the Federation, there is an inevitable final battle between Kirk and Chang.  With just as inevitable results.<br />While the television series often did the same, specifically regarding Viet Nam and the Cold War of almost forty years ago, it did so with a great deal more tact, and much more creative writing.<br />The Undiscovered Country doesn't have those qualities.  It is preachy and strident.  The actors and actresses speak and behave far out of character, i.e., Spock's mind assault on his lieutenant, and their strongly hinted at affair, or Scotty's comment regarding &quot;that Klingon b***h&quot;.  <br />This is a movie that tries to use special effects to compensate for poor writing, worse gags for cheap laughs, and a total lack of regard for well established and well known characters.   <br />No, this is not Star Trek at it's best, or even, in my opinion, Star Trek at all.  It is the final wringing of the now only damp towel of the franchise, to get those last few drops of cash from it before the original crew was too old to make any more movies.<br />I stopped collecting at The Voyage Home.  Don't waste your money, or, more importantly, your time.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Only one other movie soundtrack has made me emotionally moved. And that was Han Zimmer's Gladiator. Well, when I saw the trailer for &quot;The Passion of The Christ,&quot; I was moved by it's music and imagery. I pre-ordered the CD before I saw the film, and now that I have it, I'm moved by it. It causes me to recall images from the movie that I found to be the most captivating (and horrifying) ever filmed. This soundtrack is amazing, and I'm so glad I own it.<br />My favorites on the CD include:<br />&quot;The Olive Garden,&quot; &quot;Mary Goes to Jesus,&quot; &quot;Crucifixion,&quot; &quot;Raising the Cross,&quot; and &quot;Resurrection.&quot;<br />It may not be full of scripture, but the music is enough for me to recall the images of my Savior being tortured while he had me on his mind.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the last years. The music is really cool, touching and smart.<BR>One thing I have to mention inmy review is that I don't think this record will take many listens to appreciate. On hearing such gems like 'Lucky', 'Karma Police' and 'Exit Music' for the first or second time you can already understand how great the album is.<BR>If you like concept albums and have nothing against metal music, I would also recommend Tool's AEnima.
0452285186|5.0|There are cartoons in this book that will make you laugh so hard you pee in your pants.  You will want to rip some of the cartoons out of the book and post them on the door of your office or frame them for your bathroom.  This is better than Gary Larson.  BUY IT!  You will laugh -- a lot!  Just make sure you pee BEFORE you start reading the book.
B000002UDB|3.0|I read a number of reviews of this one before writing my own. This recording seems to bring out strong defenders and vehement dissenters (although in the latter category, it seems there are just as many Beatles haters as people who are reviewing MMT)<BR>Personally I think this one is a mixed bag, starting out with one of the weakest collection Beatles songs that ever opened up one of thier albums. From the trite and repetitive title track to the eminently forgettable &quot;Your Mother Should Know,&quot; the first five cuts make you wish this would end and end quickly. I even saw that &quot;Flying&quot; has its defenders and to me that just sounds like a cut that was unacceptable for the Dutch band, Focus.<BR>But then &quot;I am The Walrus&quot; kicks in and you enter into another realm, like a sonic Bosch or Dali. Things just keep getting better with each cut (&quot;Strawberry Fields/&quot;Penny Lane&quot; rank up there with the band's best work.) and you realize that this is what CD's were made for programming the good stuff. MMT is far from the band's best overall work, but there are definitely gems here that are worth having in any collection
0671004611|1.0|This book reminded me of the articles commonly found in supermarket tabloids.  The author completely fails to substantiate any of his rather remarkable claims.  He offers no concrete or verifiable facts, only conjecture and his far fetched theories.  For instance, he offers as evidence of his claims (in the appendices) copies of a formerly classified &quot;lunar moon base plan&quot; drawn up by the US Army in March 1959.  This document was drawn up well before the United States had even successfully launched an unmanned satellite into earth orbit.  This document speaks only in generalities and has more in common with the science fiction novels of the era than a technical paper.  The other documents included in the appendicies are 40-50 year old formerly classified government correspondence/documents that included no specific details, only vague recommendation for further review or study.  There is no bibliography.  In other words, they are simply noise, just a few more pages in a sea of paper generated by an army of bureaucrats more than 4 decades ago.  It is a mystery why the authors would bother to classify such materials as these.<br />It also becomes apparent from the author's theories and conclusions that he has little, if any, scientific or engineering background.  Perhaps he actually believes what he has written, but I certainly was not the least bit convinced.  Indeed, I found the author's claims to be about as believable as the latest headlines seen in the National Enquirer.
0688163173|5.0|Shutter Island is a totally gripping read--you will not be able to put it down once you start it.  As an indication--I read this novel in one day, and it was a work day.  A word of advice to anyone reading this novel--try to make sure someone else you know has already read it.  That way, when you come to the ending, there will be someone around for you to discuss it with.  The novel begins as two detectives are headed towards an small island to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a convicted murderer at a psychiatric institute.  The plot just takes off from there.  After a couple of twists, you'll wonder just where this whole thing is headed.  I had a couple of possible scenarios running through my head.  There was one in particular where I thought &quot;If this is where, he's going, I'll be so angry, it won't work.&quot;  Well, that's Lehane went, but the astonishing thing he makes the ending work.  It's ambiguous, for the most part, but that's why I recommend you know someone else who has read this novel before you crack it open.  You will need to talk about it.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This movie is one of the VERY few that I actually saw more than once in theaters.  And I'm a girl, thankyouverymuch, so this is not strictly a \\"guy film.\\"  Loved the action, the drama, the music...I loved everything about this movie.  I too have read the books, and although there are several departures, the overall story is still quite amazing and some lines and scenes are almost identical.  If you haven't seen this movie, rent it as soon as it comes out, and if you like it BUY!  I patiently await the release.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I loved this DVD.  Wonderful tribute to a ledgend.  Everyone who was important to him in life came to pay tribute to him with his music.  I would recommend this to anyone who loved the Beatles and especially anyone who loved George's music.  It is such a excellent tribute to him and his music.
0375704027|5.0|What is it about these Japanese writers that are able to make prose sound like Poetry? I am a fan of Banana Yoshimoto, another Japanese writer, whose book \\"the Kitchen\\" is one of my favorites. Norwegian Wood deals with the same \\"life after (the) death (of a close person)\\" issues and what it does to those left behind. However, whereas \\"the Kitchen\\" is a short, condensed book which brings on, alongside the feelings of grief and pain a very strong passion for life and all it has to offer, Norwegian Wood is a very long (at least - it feels like very long) tale with a lot of detailed inside reflection and thought. <BR>I was not expecting this book to be what it is - a wonderful, dark piece of art. A heavy shadow clings to your heart while reading this story and the feeling of sadness and very deep sorrow is overwhelming and stays with you for a long time. I was therefore surprised to read that this book is described as an \\"erotic love story\\". It is true that the book has many sex scenes, but the sex is so painful and so connected to the overall grave feeling of the book that it brings no comfort. Also, the words \\"love story \\", seem - so I feel - to simplify this very complicated story.<BR>Reading the translator's note at the end of the book I understand that the story has some autobiographical points, especially in the portrayal of a Japanese student life in the 70 years. For me however, this was a very personal inner account of a difficult time in a young man's life - a period that will leave its deep marks and in many ways will shape the man he is about to become. Norwegian Wood deals with questions of loyalty - to yourself, to the dead and the living and discusses the thin line between sanity and insanity. Most of all you are a participant to the hero's inner world - his feelings and the process of his falling in love - what he is drawn to and what captures his heart.<BR>Highly recceomended.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Actually this is one of the firsts reviews I write, but for this album I could write many more. This is with no doubt the best album of 2003, it is even better than radiohead's hail to the thief, and that is much to say. Absolution could take you from a chaotic end of the world to a peaceful landscape, song by song the album grows in itself until the end of the journey.<BR>There is no low points here, you don't even think in skip a song, and the best thing is that it starts to like you more with every listen.<br />Even if you're not a muse fan this is the best way to get into their music, you'll feel the power of this album since the first song.
0385504209|4.0|otherwise a great story!  I wanted more heat between the lead characters but The movie will change that...
B00008OTCB|2.0|Malgrés le fait que nous avons fait très attention, nous avons été déçu que ce dvd ne contient pas le film en tant que tel. <br />Le dvd ne contient qu'une version imagée du film et est montrée comme si c'était un livre, en d'autres termes, ce ne sont que des images figées (screenshots) du film avec du texte affiché et lu par un narrateur.<br />Nous somme donc déçus que la description du DVD ne fasse pas clairement mention de ce détail que je juge très important. Le prix était trop beau pour être vrai!
0393057658|3.0|First of all, I must admit that I have been one of Lewis' fans since his classic Liar's Poker. How could I miss this one which Tom Wolfe described on the inside back cover as Lewis' grandest tour de force yet? However, being a Chinese trader who's ignorant about baseball, I could only complete the first two chapters (42 pages out of 288) and put it down. The large amount of baseball jargon and player name just stopped me from reading onwards. In fact, this review is written with the sole purpose to warn fellow Lewis' fans that this book, unlike his previous ones, require readers of certain knowledge and interest of baseball. If you're not a baseball fan, I strongly suggest you to give this book a pass.
0739313126|5.0|Fantastic, gripping, colorful, ingenious!  I listen to the tapes during commute to and from work and although I would be happy to be home after a long day, I found myself several times sitting in my car in the driveway to hear the next chapter!!  Enjoy!
B0001AP12G|5.0|I read a lot of reviews, some good, some bad. The thing that sets Kanye's cd apart from the rest right now, is that it's HONEST!! Tight producer, nice lyricist. Listening to this cd reminds me of the first time I heard Common's &amp;quot;Like Water For Chocolate&amp;quot;. Kanye has mainstream songs on this cd, that sounds different from regular mainstream songs. My favorite song is Jesus Walks, because he actually spoke on Jesus. BRAVE!!
B000056Q81|5.0|What can I say about this album. It's stunning, it's elegant and it's really a joy to listen to ( you probably thought for a minute there I was talking about her and not her music!)!<br />You have a fascinating little biography from Bob Stanley on her who speaks of her as a fan of her music and well what more can I say really. You need to hear this album and I mean that<br />Oh I should mention one thing is that I'm glad that these songs are all sung in French. It gives the songs a dimension of sensuality which I don't find in many English/American singers
0385504209|5.0|This novel was really really good.  This novel was good on 2 levels.  First this was an excellent adventure novel.  I liked the action with Langdon and Newvel.  I also liked how they got along together.  Secondly it was a first rate mystery novel.  I consider myself a little bit of a mystery buff and this novel was tops in that catagory.  Third this novel was almost like a history book.  I've always been a history buff.  From Adam and Eve to King Tut to Johnny Appleseed and all the men and women in between I love them all.  This novel made history more interesting than normal.  Alot of the history in this novel was unknown to me.  I don't know if I missed some of it in school or just didn't get to that stuff, but this novel taught me alot of history and I thought I already knew it all.  Oh well live and learn.  I'd like to know if Mr. Dan Brown has a background in history.  Maybe a Professor.  I guess any novel of any type of genre should teach you something.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|I used to check out the video of this from my local public library (not the kind of thing one finds on the shelf at Blockbuster), and found myself going back to it again and again, over time.  I was drawn into its pace, its quiet, its wandering.  Now, the DVD - not a perfect package, certainly, but well worth the price.  Cheap-o case, slim \\"extras\\" - what the hell is with that \\"music-only\\" soundtrack, anyway?  It really is just the visual of the film playing with the added music (what little there is), no dialog or other sounds, not even the Yardbirds stuff!<br />While the audio commentary is potentially off-putting (be prepared for obligatory academic fussing about male dominance, \\"male gaze\\" etc), the guy manages to stay focussed on what's on screen at the moment, and even comes through with a few worthwhile observations - particularly the film's motif of things losing their meaning when placed out of context (the one photo left behind after the burglary, the broken guitar fretboard taken from the club).  While a regular viewer might observe the photographer being kind of snippy (and - gasp! - rude) toward his models, the critic complains of his \\"brutal\\" treatment of women; when Hemmings is taking pictures of Veruschka, and then stops when he feels he's done taking pictures, our audio professor sniffs at the photographer/male oppressor using and discarding the poor, sensitive, victimized model.  Sheeesh!  What was he supposed to do, cuddle her?  <br />I suppose it is a relevant topic in the context of Antonioni's other work, but the guy takes too much delight in skewering the main character, who we are supposed to like, after all.  (Pretty much the same thing happens with the critc's commentary on the Criterion DVD of \\"Straw Dogs\\").<br />Overall though, the commentary is not too intrusive, and the more relevant insights, and the power of the film itself, offset any rhetorical groaners one might hear.  I'm not sure if I ever noticed the apparent glimpse of the Vanessa Redgrave character on the street at night, quickly vanishing in the crowd.  The use of the director's camera-eye to separate itself from the main character's point of view is another element to the sense of mystery.  About the only moment in the film that doesn't ring true for me is the catatonic audience at Ricky Tick's - one cannot listen to the Yardbirds (live, no less) in such a state.
B00004STW3|3.0|I had the cards when I was a kid (they left out the giant insects, one of the best parts of the card series) They used big movie stars to no avail, in fact they got in the way. I think Jack N. is one of the best, but he had that awful run-on scene where he is trying to convince the Martian leader, pathetic, was Tim Burton trying to squeeze water from a stone. In my opinion, Tim Burton's earlier work is great but this was an over indulgent miss. Power corrupts! I liked the movie, but it could have been so much better. Will movie history prove me wrong? No! Look at the overall score, 3 and 1/3 stars, that's about right.
0385491026|5.0|I read this book every few years because it's a multi-sense experience - I swear, you will smell and taste and feel and BE with the characters of this book.  More than anything, it's the strength of Atwood's words that keep pulling me back to this book.  Margaret Atwood is a master at manifesting imagery from words.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a nice, slow read that's to be savored like dark chocolate.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I must admit I rarely ever listen to metal because the bands I usually hear are crass or in the case of some death metal bands I've heard....they sound as sedate and sludgy and not really all that interesting. This however is not sedate.....this is fierce and manic beyond all belief. This is what metal is supposed to be like. The leads solos sound so caustic that they compliment the lyrics so well and can at times seem unbearable ( well that's if you link the lyrics and the riffs together - otherwise they're riff haven for the metal afficionado )<br />Coming from someone who usually never really buys a metal album....this is essential....it's only a pity that they spawned off an entire generation of sub-standard crap imitators
B0001HAISG|5.0|Don't miss it on DVD! This is one super movie, and can be enjoyed by the whole family. The young lead actors (Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood) were terrific, and displayed a chemistry that is unusual for such youthful actors. And Jason Issacs was both fun to watch and just intimidating enough as Hook to rise above the previous incarnations of the character. I urge all parents who were concerned with the critical reviews of the movie when it was released in theaters to give it a chance on the small screen. It is a true classic-in-waiting. So don't wait---buy it and let the little child in you have some fun!
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I'm not a really big Alicia Keys fan, but I am a big fan of good music. The song that I heard that really sparked my interest into this CD was &quot;Diary&quot;, by far my favorite and one of THE best songs on the CD. I think alot of the more fast paced songs/beats weren't all that great but the messages of the songs were. I wish this CD contained more jazzy, slower, hot tracks like her first CD had. Overall, my fav's are:<br /> &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;<br /> &quot;Diary&quot;<br /> &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;<br /> &quot;Feeling You Feeling Me&quot; (I wish were a full song)
B00004YKUY|5.0|Arrival is spectacular. I know Steve Perry is missing from the fold but so what. This album rocks. &quot;Higher Place&quot; is reminiscant of Separate Ways and I could have sworn I heard a trace of &quot;Who's Cryin' Now&quot; in Neal Schon's guitar on &quot;Signs of Life&quot;. With Your Love is on par with &quot;Faithfully&quot;, Open Arms, and &quot;Send Her My Love&quot;. The album is just loaded with good, sorely needed rock songs. It took me a couple of years to accept Journey without Perry but I'm hooked. I've had all the classics out in force. It's good to be a teenager again.
B00008J4P5|5.0|...You never know what kind of music your'e going to get next. The White Stripes manage to put jazz, hard rock, soft rock, and some very Queen inspired music(A la, There's No Home For You Here). I thought that they fluidly incorporated all these different kinds of music into one solid final album. Though there are some duds on this CD(In the Cold, Cold Night and It's True We Love One Another), overall the songs are very catchy and make you want to listen to them with the volume way up so you can fully hear the excellent guitar riffs and bass beats. On the instruments though, I sorta have a problem with Meg White's drums,though it's not that she's a bad drummer, her playing just get masked by the other instruments. This is the first album I got from the White Stripes, and I'm probably going to get some of their other albums. Also, what the heck is wrong with Jack White's voice? How can a guy that's that thin have the voice of an overweight male gospel singer? Curious... Anyways, here's the best songs: Seven Nation Army, Black Mouth, Little Acorns(Awesome guitar playing Jack!), and There's No Home For You Here. Worst songs: In the Cold, Cold Night(Repetitive and Boring), You've Got Her In Your Pocket( Gets old after the same old stuff for 3 and a half minutes, like the way Jack's voice mixes with the music, though), and It's True We Love One Another (Stupid, fills up space). My actual rating for this CD is 4.5 stars, because of those 3 duds, but the other songs are great,and they would have earned 5 stars. God, does everybody quote Forrestt Gump?
B000003TAL|5.0|The music is superb and it is the album that no Sonic Youth fan can do without. If this doesn't have you hooked to them like some sort of drug addict, then I think another band is what you need ( although I don't see why that should happen )
B0000C6E4D|1.0|Here's my gripe with &quot;Afterglow&quot;.  Sarah's album have progressed towards a new and fresh sound with each release.  Each album has it's own unique 'theme' or 'sound', and it makes the album more cohesive and a pleasure to listen to.  With &quot;Afterglow&quot; the album sounds disjointed and hap-hazard.  Some of the tracks sound like they were rejects from &quot;Surfacing&quot; (you gotta admit &quot;Fallen&quot; could have easily been on &quot;Surfacing&quot;).  Apparently, she wrote most of these tracks right around that time, or right after the release of &quot;Surfacing&quot; (learned this on some message board).  The tracks are coming off sounding very similar to &quot;Surfacing&quot; era tracks and show no progression of her sound.  Which is what I like so much from her previous work.  Some of the tracks show some sort of new direction, but even this is understated and come off over-produced.  Pierre Marchand, who produced this album as well, seems to have not brought out the best in Sarah this time around.  Which is surprising b/c he is the one who created the magic that made FTE so beautiful.  He over produced the vocals and added too many string arrangements and guitar layers, never allowing the song itself (and the vocals) to shine.  Most of the lyrics are trite and meaningless, for example the song &quot;Stupid&quot; (which also wins for the worst song title ever) she sings &quot;How stupid could I be...you're no good for me, but you're the only one I see.&quot;  What happened Sarah?  Her lyrics used to be the most alluring part of her music.  She must have suffered from an extreme case of writer's block.  To her credit there are some 'pretty' songs on here, i.e. &quot;Answer&quot;, but even these fall short of anything even remotely close to her previous work.  &quot;Fallen&quot; is a decent track, with good lyrics, but I keep saying to myself, &quot;didn't I hear this one before?&quot;.<br />I'm not saying it's a bad album.  It's more of a disappointment.  It may grow on me as I listen to it more, but no other Sarah album ever had to &quot;grow on me&quot; before.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really thought I was going to hear something fresh and new.  Like a breathe of fresh air, rather than the stale scent of an &quot;Afterglow&quot;.

I cannot wait to see what this author comes up with next because this is just a unique read.  It makes you long for an adventure/experience such as that lived by the characters of the Cloud Atlas.
0385504209|1.0|This book begins in an exciting, suspenseful and thrilling manner, but it soon loses the reader's interest with its unbelievable, historically inaccurate plot.  Many people will read this and think it is historical fact or truth.  It is not.  It is a NOVEL based on the most outrageous, revisionist history.  The book would have had more credibility if it was based in something that was historically plausible.  Readers who are analytical will immediately lose interest as the plot and story line are revealed in their fullness.  It's just not believable, even as a novel.<br />It's not worth your time or your money.

The film makes me feel really happy, the songs are unforgetable and the characters are just real funny especially Johnny Depp. I have mailed the director about releasing the film on DVD and i cant wait for it to happen. I am sure lots of people will buy.  So \\"please Mr Jailer\\" give us Cry baby on DVD

B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash are known as being one of the greatest punk bands ever, and that's certainly a fair statement. They had so many things that the other punk groups of the 70s had, such as passion and integrity... but what put them over the top was the amazing level of intelligence of so many of their records. ... The best example being London Calling.<br />London Calling still has the political awareness that made their selftitled so great, but things here are more organized. It's easy to see that The Clash had a lot to say; 19 tracks, with different styles all over. For people into short, catchy punk songs, there are &quot;Koka Kola&quot; and &quot;Death or Glory&quot;. For fans of political anthems, there are &quot;London Calling&quot; (the famous single), &quot;Hateful&quot;, &quot;Clampdown&quot;, &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot;, and &quot;Revolution Rock&quot;. For the social side of life, there are &quot;Rudie Can't Fail&quot; and &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot;. For the love song fanatic in so many of us, there's &quot;Train in Vain&quot;. For those who just want something off the wall, there's &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot;. The list goes on and on. What makes the album so admirably listenable is the diversity the album has, lyrically and instrumentally. It's jazz, punk, classic rock n' roll, and many other styles in one.<br />London Calling is for everyone... everyone willing to listen. Some will say it's the best album ever. Others will say it's just another great record by The Clash. Still others will say that it's both.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|What a horrible movie. I can not even begin to fathom why ANYONE would even BEGIN to award Lost In Snoozland --- I mean Lost In Translation. I rented this movie over the weekend. It was completely stupid. It was so boring. I sat with my remote in hand constantly on the fast forward button looking for the actual plot to begin. It never did.<br />So my question is, why is this movie being touted as one of the best of 2004? I think every year there has to be a movie that Hollywood embraces to make the rest of America feel stupid. It exists to make those of us who are not part of the Hollywood elite stop and think, &quot;am I not smart enough or deep enough to understand what this movie is saying?&quot;<br />You see my theory is there is this one guy in Hollywood, we'll call him Lou. Lou is probably a washed up old Hollywood power player. Perhaps he was (or still is) a talent agent or head of a prominent studio. Several years ago, Lou was somehow wronged by the Hollywood community. He was able to dust himself off and make it seem as though he survived the cruelty. However, something in Lou's mind snapped. He is bent on revenge. Every year Lou finds the worst movie made and embraces it. He says I LOVE this film. Then Lou sits back and laughs his fool head off as the lemmings of Hollywood follow suit. Every year Lou gets his revenge by watching how DUMB the Hollywood wackos really can be.<br />Now this may seem like an elaborate story but trust me Lou must exist. How else can we describe a movie like Lost In Translation being nominated for Best Picture? How else can Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray receive awards and accolades for the most sleep inducing film in recent years? Just a thought. But the next time you are in a dark movie theater or you own living room and realize that you have no idea why ANYONE would think the snoozer of the film that you are suffering through seems to be such a hit with other people, remember poor old Lou and smile as you picture him with a cigar hanging out of the left corner of his mouth, a wicked smile plastered across his face saying, &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Then just chalk it up to revenge getting the better of us all.h a cigar hanging out of the left corner of his mouth, a wicked smile plastered across his face saying, &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Then just chalk it up to revenge getting the better of us all.
0142000663|5.0|`The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most famous books written by John Steinbeck, and it also is largely praised as one of his best works. The book received a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Award winning movie. This novel is one of the best when it comes to portrait the consequences of the Great Depression in the life of poor families that were forced to leaver their homeland to search for food and jobs.<br />The narrative is filled with details of the landscape and the people. The main characters are the Joad family who embarks in a road trip to California, where they expect to find a better life. Throughout this journey they run into every sort of people --good and bad -- that will help, or not, them. Every new stop is a new challenge for the family, a new barrier to overcome.<br />Not only is the story beautiful, but also very compelling. Steinbeck created an unforgettable portrait of those lives, which were so sad and difficult. One of the major qualities of `The Grapes of Wrath' is the language. While the narrator has a clear and grammar-perfect voice, the author could reproduce the dialogues with perfection. They were written in the way those migrants would talk. It is difficult for the contemporary reader, but not impossible. Such device requires more attention of the reader, but it gives more pleasure once one gets used to this language.<br />This novel interweaves two different kinds of chapters. In one of them the writer sets a general view of the migrants, their way of life, their habitat and such. In the other he talks about the Joads. Using such device, he makes the Joads' story universal. This single family could be everyone's who has to leave their homeland to find job and food in another place. The problems this family face are very down to earth. And, this kind of thing still happens everywhere.<br />With `The Grapes of Wrath', John Steinbeck created a story that criticizes not only the ferocious capitalism, but, above all, the human nature. The evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions.evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions.
B000002GC2|3.0|From what I knew of some of Quincy Jones' other releases, and judging by the comments I'd read, I was expecting something a little jazzier than what I got (especially since Patti Austin's name was attached to it).  The CD is well-produced (I wouldn't have expected otherwise), but the selections are pretty standard disco/soul-era pieces with not a lot of creativity and edge.  My favorite cut was &quot;Velas&quot; - a sweet, tranquil piece featuring Thielemans' harmonica.  &quot;Just Once&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Ways&quot; have been done to death on the smooth jazz and adult contemporary stations.  I suppose I should have checked the copyright date - 1981 - which would put this towards the end of the disco era.  A decent CD for those looking for this type of thing, but jazz/soul or urban R&amp;B or swing big band lovers should look elsewhere.  Just a warning so you don't get caught like I did!

B0001ENY6M|5.0|I would have to say that this score is amazing. The orchestration paints pictures without you even having to see the movie. I bought the CD before even seeing the movie because someone told me it sounded similar to the Gladiator soundtrack, one of my favorite soundtracks, and I figured I had nothing to lose. But I only had everything to gain.<BR>The choirs made the soundtrack. I found the music to be very time-oriented and environmentally influenced. <BR>The score opens with \\"The Olive Garden/The Night Sky\\", a sad and lonely piece of music that makes you see the reflection of the moonlight on an empty ground among rocks and night shadows.<BR>Following is \\"Bearing the Cross\\" that captures the essence and emotion of the moment, taking your deepest feelings and changing them to music form. <BR>\\"Jesus Arrested\\" is mysterious, then insane, then back to calm, quiet, yet suspenseful. This track flows into \\"Peter Denies Jesus\\", a slow-moving ballad filled with despair and fear.<BR>\\"The Stoning\\" is a single woman vocalizing with a steady synth in the background, later blossoming into forgiveness and purity.<BR>\\"Song of Complaint\\" is perhaps the slowest song, rushing quickly into \\"Simon is Dismissed\\", a very Middle-Eastern sounding song with touches of Roman drums.<BR>\\"Flagellation...\\" is quite slow and reflective and melts into \\"Mary Goes to Jesus\\", a full, round orchestral piece touched with pain and longing, yet triumph and sacrifice.<BR>\\"Peaceful But Primitive Procession\\" was the song that most reminded me of Gladiator, because the music and instruments and vocals were similar, but that is just my opinion. <BR>Then the next song is \\"Crucifixion\\", my personal favorite song. I heard the song before seeing the movie, but the song allowed me to imagine. I'm not even a Christian and this song was so amazing! So... the only word I can use to describe it is intense. It begins softly, slowly, soothingly... almost lazily. It reminded me of water for some reason. Water and wind. Then I always jump when the drums come in and the ardent, driving melody gradually gets stronger and stronger, more persistent. Then it stops for a moment. A couple measures of barely nothing, then back into the choir and stringed instruments and beautifully depressing composition, ending softly and dramatically.<BR>\\"Raising the Cross\\" is also intense and moving. You can see everything right in your mind! From the soldiers to the watchers to the friends to the accusers. Everything is there. Then it stops. The music fades and we are left with only a couple lonely instruments and one or two singers, gracefully breathing out a few agonized vocals, later accompanied by a smaller choir of women.<BR>(Almost there. Almost done.)<BR>\\"It is Done\\" is a single woman vocalizing shortly, lamenting and burdened.  <BR>Then the rapid, fast-paced \\"Jesus is Carried Down\\", which I can really only describe as urgent, out-of-control, and almost scary, especially when the choir randomly begins moaning, wailing, and crying.<BR>And lastly, \\"Resurrection\\", the triumphant, fervent, and impassioned ending to one of the most stunning and dynamic compilations I have ever had the opportunity to take in.

B0000640VN|4.0|I didn't catch \\"Kate & Leopold\\" in theaters, and I missed it when it hit DVD last year. I just never seemed to be in the mood for a frothy Meg Ryan comedy about a New York career woman who, thanks to a \\"crack in time,\\" falls in love<BR>with a duke from the late 1800s.<br />  But I recently read Peter Biskind's new book, \\"Down and Dirty Pictures,\\" an absorbing examination of independent cinema that focuses largely on Miramax, the once-small distribution house that hit a boon in the late '80s with \\"sex, lies, and videotape,\\" then struck gold with \\"The Piano\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" was bought by Disney and became a big production company with a serious Oscar resume.<br />  Miramax produced \\"Kate & Leopold,\\" and one of the more interesting sagas in Biskind's book is how the film (which scored high with test audiences) was inexplicably cut and recut by Miramax's notoriously volatile and \\"edit happy\\" head, Harvey Weinstein, right up until its release.<br />  Intrigued, I rented the DVD and was surprised to discover that the disk contains two versions of the film: the shorter version that ran in theaters but also co-writer / director James Mangold's better, slightly more complex original version. Both have commentary by Mangold that explain in detail how the movie was made and how it was eventually unmade.<br />  None of this would matter at all if both versions stank, of course, but \\"Kate & Leopold\\" is a surprisingly fun escapist romance. It's lightweight but finds a nice even ratio between fluff and substance. That's largely due to inspired, clever writing (a monologue about dogs' inability to see rainbows<BR>is corny and beautiful and could've come straight out of a Frank Capra movie). The movie's other ace is the always reliable Hugh Jackman as Leopold, a 19th century gentleman who finds himself stuck in modern-day Manhattan; the character and the situation are ridiculous, but Jackman plays it completely straight and with such sincere, kooky dignity that he makes the premise fly.<br />It's a shame such a nice little movie met with such an unfortunate fate, but had it not  I might never have gotten around to seeing it.

And yet, Jerry does have one endearing, enduring quality: Loyalty.<br />Late one night, Jerry has an epiphany, or as he puts it, he doesn't know if it was a \\"breakdown\\" or a \\"breakthrough.\\" He types an inspiring \\"mission statement\\" on how agents ought to do their jobs. The mission statement does not have the intended effect, but it does inspire at least one person. (I'm being purposely vague, to avoid spoiling the story.) <br />\\"Dorothy Boyd\\" (Renee Zellweger) is an accountant at the firm, who is inspired by Jerry's words. She falls in love with Jerry, but does Jerry love her? Oh, and did I mention, that Dorothy is a \\"single mother\\"? Well, actually, she's a widow; calling her a \\"single mother\\" is one of the movie's intermittent pc tics. Dorothy's chubby, bright son, \\"Ray\\" (Jonathan Lipnicki), who appears to be about five years old, and has been starved for a man in his life, takes to Jerry immediately. The feeling is mutual.<br />(The other pc aspects involve a woman beating the hell out of Jerry, one character referring to a deaf relative as \\"hearing-impaired,\\" and the conceit of having a black NFL player lecture his white agent on how to love a woman, and on how to respect a \\"single mother,\\" a conceit which will be particularly jarring to anyone at all familiar with professional sports. At least the movie does have a sense of humor about feminism, and even a little about race, as the black player has Maguire shouting, \\"I love black people!\\") <br />\\"Rod Tidwell\\" (Cuba Gooding), whom Jerry represents, is an under-sized NFL wide receiver with an over-sized chip on his shoulder. This character gave America the phrase, \\"Show me the money!,\\" which became ubiquitous for a few months. <br />Most of this two-hour-and-eighteen-minute movie consists of tightly framed, intimate scenes with either Cruise and Gooding or Cruise and Zellweger. \\"Intimate\\" means that the actors must carry the scene; there is no distraction to diffuse the drama or cover for poor performers. And as good as the scenes are with Zelleweger and Cruise, the ones with Cruise and Gooding are even more intense. <br />I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but I have to give the Devil his due. He richly deserved his Oscar nomination as Jerry.<br />This was Renee Zellweger's breakthrough role, in which she displayed the winsome, spunky persona that has since become her calling card in movies such as Bridget Jones' Diary and Cold Mountain. <br />After Cuba Gooding won the Academy Award for best supporting actor as Rod Tidwell, I recall sitting in a Union Square coffee shop in Manhattan, and telling someone that Gooding only got the Oscar because he was black. A big, beefy, middle-aged black man in the next booth heard me and sighed loudly, to express his anger. (No, I hadn't yet seen the movie, but the odds were very much in my favor.) Well, I was wrong. Gooding's role is much meatier than a typical supporting role - almost a lead - and he makes the most of it. <br />But there are many other great players, too. And every role is exquisitely cast, particularly Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's caustic, feminist, older sister, \\"Laurel,\\" who hosts a support group of embittered, man-bashing, forty-something women, Regina King in the Alfre Woodard role as Tidwell's wife, \\"Marcee,\\" and Jay Mohr as Jerry's slimy protege, \\"Bob Sugar.\\" Beau Bridges and Kelly Preston also shine in smaller roles.<br />Jerry Maguire is not \\"high concept.\\" There are no car crashes. There is lots of talk. Amazing talk. Director-screenwriter Cameron Crowe wrote one of the best original scripts of the past twenty years. He does here what he has developed a well-deserved reputation for: Showing the world behind the façade (see also Almost Famous) of an apparently glamorous but actually tawdry social milieu (ain't they all?). This movie is for grown-ups.<br />But Crowe choreographs scenes so well, whether involving a mob of people or just two, that they don't come off as \\"talky.\\" (Besides, unless one is an action junkie, the feeling of \\"talkiness\\" is often the result of a bad script.) <br />And oh, the acting. The comparison that comes to mind, is Terms of Endearment, which was the quintessential domestic drama. When TOE came out in 1983, I recall a critic writing that it showcased the best acting you'd ever see in an American movie. That judgment was unfair to American movies; TOE showcases some of the best acting you'll ever see in a movie, period. As does Jerry Maguire. There is not a single clearly flubbed line or wasted scene in this entire movie. <br />The best thing I can say about Jerry Maguire, is that I liked it a lot the first time I saw it, and I loved it, the second time around.<br />The Critical Critic, February 26, 2004

0676973779|2.0|While my friends raved about this book, I was not impressed. The first section of the book describing Pi's life before the shipwreck was well written and interesting, especailly Pi's search for God. However, I found the description of Pi's existence on the life boat to be boring and tedious. I admit I skipped several paragraphs and at times complete pages.<br />The parts that were interesting were violent. I was disgusted by the author's excrutiating detail of how the zebra suffered before dying. The deaths of the other animals were equally brutal, and I found the cannabilism offensive. The alternative ending was certainly intriguing and creative, but I still read the last page of this novel with a sigh of relief that it was finally over.<br />Having said this, I must admit that I appear to be the only person who feels this way.

It's a shame Geoff Downes was only around for this album because he sounds great with Yes. And &quot;Drama&quot; is one of the truly great Chris Squire records: his bass playing is inspired and he contributes a lot of the vocals, along with Trevor Horn, to make it sound like Yes even if Anderson is not there. The production is excellent (reminds us that Horn is a better at producing than singing). Some people dismiss this cd because of the unusual lineup but I do not agree: yes, the live shows suffered from Jon Anderson's absence, but in the studio, this was a terrific band.
0385504209|4.0|I picked this up to pass time during a recent flight and found it an enjoyable read. The plot is fun and easy to understand and the writing style is easy to read. I can see this being made into a fun movie.<br />For those of you offended by it's claims, it is a fiction book. Sure some of it's historical claims are just wrong. But there is enough truth that it's readers may just be driven to investigate the &quot;facts&quot; and learn some actual history along the way.
B00009Z574|2.0|&quot;Tormato&quot; found Yes in the middle of a musical crisis. The English press was praising punk and new wave bands, and bands like Yes were called &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. Maybe because of the new musical climate, Yes abandonned the 15-25 minutes song format and concentrated on shorter songs. But the band was still short on inspiration, as this uneven cd demonstrates. Tracks like &quot;Release Release&quot;, &quot;Onward&quot; and &quot;On The Silent Wings of Freedom&quot; are good, but others like &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Future Times&quot; or &quot;Madrigal&quot; are just plain boring. The production is quite dry: one wishes the band had hired a producer instead of doing it themselves. &quot;Tormato&quot; is the product of a tired band, going through the motion. It's no surprise Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left after the tour that followed.

B0001HAISG|5.0|Ever wonder what kept Capt. Hook's hook on his arm?<br />Well, I never have, but I found out from watching this new movie!  The new Peter Pan has so many different levels to it, and I love all of them.<br />First of all, it's just so enjoyable to watch.  It was like a combination of the old Disney cartoon and the Mary Martin musical.  The movie captures the essence of the book with out copying it word for word.  The characters and the spirit of the book are so exact in the movie, that the changes that have been made in the script are almost unnoticable.<br />Secondly, this version does not ignore attraction that there is between Peter and Wendy.  This always frustrated me in the older versions of Peter Pan and I am very pleased to see it finally addressed in this version.  It makes the movie a little more sad because Wendy wants to grow up and love, while Peter wishes to stay a boy forever, never hearing of the word love.<br />This movie also brings up the psychological aspects of the book as well.  The idea that Neverland is the place children go in their sleep is more evident here and emphasized by the tradition of having the same actor play both Hook and Mr. Darling.  Is it coincidence that Wendy flies off to fight the mean Hook the night after her father angrily tells her she must grow up?  This movie also adds a little bit of sorrow to its characters.  Captain Hook, although having light moments, is a darker, more sinister character.  This is the first version where I, actually, did not want him to die.  There is a scene where Hook, wandering through the forest, sees Peter and Wendy dancing.  Looking at them sadly, he moans that Peter has found someone, and Hook, now, is all alone.<br />Also, this film was superbly acted.  Jeremy Sumpter played an adorable Peter, the only American actor in the film (Pan usually seems to be American, probably because he lives on an island with American Indians).  All of the children in this movie were absolutely adorable, and I rarely like child actors.  Each and everyone of them captured their characters perfectly.  Jason Isaacs played Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook and was superb!

See this movie.and I rarely like child actors.  Each and everyone of them captured their characters perfectly.  Jason Isaacs played Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook and was superb!

B00018D44U|2.0|Wow.  What can say?  I can safely say Nora won't have to worry about carting home eight Grammys next year.  She won't have to worry about carting away one.  This is one of the biggest sophomore flops I can remember and my expectations were not even that high.<br />There are so many things wrong with this CD: 1) The sound transfer to the CD is awful.  I played this at a low volume and her voice was still distorted in three of the songs.  2) The material, melodies and album continuity is absolutely dismal.  I only liked one song on the disc, In The Morning, which is why I even gave it two stars.  These are not quality written songs.  3) She did a duet with Dolly Parton on Creepin' In and Dolly wasn't listed as a co-singer.  She was only listed in the \\"appears as a courtesy\\" section.  Such disrespect for an icon.  4) The record company released the liner notes with unfinished paper.  Yep, not even a gloss finish.  It's no surprise because it matches the rest of the album - CHEAP.<br />Friends and fellow music lovers, if you think this is going to be even remotely like her debut album, you are wrong.  This is unprofessional piano lounge music.  I think Capitol Records owes the music community an explanation.  This reeks of corporate greed and does nothing to raise musical interests.
0800177177|1.0|This had to be, without question, the worst version of Dracula I've ever seen, and that even includes the Jesus Franco version and the Cliffhanger episodes in the '80's.  Oldman's performance was a bad joke, and he looked like a Carnaby Mod Rocker of the mid 60's as Dracula.  The Dracula of the book wanted to be able to lose himself into the anonymity of a big town, no way would Oldman's Dracula be able to do that.  The movie used techniques, like a rushing forward of the camera at ground level, that seemed more appropriate for a MTV video, when they were still doing that sort of thing.  I honestly hoped Anthony Hopkins would make a good Van Helsing, but it turned out he played a dissipated Captain Kronos.  Keanu Reaves was more wooden than the stakes you kill vampires with as Johnathan Harker.  Winona Ryder could've been good but they took the level head heroine of the book and made her all to girlish, and they took they more dreamy Lucy and made her more like Mae West.  On top of that, Coppola practically plagarized the Dan Curtis TV version of Dracula (1973), as scripted by Richard Matheson, and starring Jack Palance as the Count.  That's where they originally linked the historical Voivode to the fictional Count, and had all that tripe about him looking for his reincarnated wife.  Curtis used that angle earlier in Dark Shadows, and was probably inspired by the Karloff movie The Mummy.  That's just how derivative this film was, and it had virtually no suspense or true horror to break this reviewers annoyance.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I doubt many people are aware of this fine TV comedy.  You are in for a fine treat if you are here.  The casting is wonderful, as are the costumes, music, and set design.  The series is faithful to Wodehouse's stories.  If you are already a Wodehouse fan, as am I, it will give you an extra thrill to see the series rendered so flawlessly.  This is definitely a collector's item to be enjoyed over and over again and shared with the family.  Tinkerty Tonk!
B00007ELF2|5.0|As I look down this list of reviews I can't help but feel like some people missed out on the point of the movie.  Yes it has brilliant cinematography and casting.  Yes it is a complex and interesting story.  Yes it has drug use and dealing in it.  But the that is missing the point.  This movie is a critique on the war on drugs.  <BR>The message of this movie is this:  These drugs are harmful and life destroying, but the war on drugs makes these drugs more harmful while adding a fair amount of disaster itself.  <BR>If you walk out of this movie thinking you've just seen a \\"good drug movie\\" then I've got to say you've missed out.  This movie shaped my view on the war on drugs.  This is a display of how you can be adamantly against drugs and even more adamantly against the drug war.  Because we may kid ourselves and say that we're \\"fighting drugs\\", but as in all wars, we're fighting people.  Sometimes loved ones, sometimes friends, sometimes even ourselves.  And that is a war in which no one can claim victory.  <BR>That is the grim reality.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I was tempted to give this 5 stars because I've rarely seen horrible done so well.  This movie's effect had taken hold even before I saw it: I kept wondering why teens in cheap, brightly colored 4-cylinder cars were winding the engines out of what amounts to a fuel-efficient riding-mower with a car body placed on top.  <br />Then I found out. <br />A movie was out that showed small brightly-colored cars going really fast but, in the movie, they had big engines in them...and \\"Noz\\".  Apparently, the redneck striplings whizzing by don't think anyone else can tell the difference between the cars in the movie and their moms Honda.  I'll bet mechanics the world over are thrilled about this movie and the resulting boon in re-built engines, thrown rods & body-work that they've reaped.<br />Vin Diesel was perfect for this part in that he looks as dumb as he really is and saves us the tragedy of an actor of real talent being debased in a movie of this caliber.  <br />If you liked this, let me recommend something else on your level: \\"Coyote Ugly\\".  This combination may be the ultimate double-feature for today's aesthetically-challenged.  Dig in and space out!
B000068PQ0|4.0|i can;t remember how i got into the lips...or really, this cd, but i think i downloaded Fight Test and fell in love... finally bought the cd ( after d/l a couple other tracks)  and put it in rotation.. on first listen i was like, this guy has GOT to be kidding! left it in there, and pretty soon, i was anticipating every movement, singing along, basically absorbing the cd. it;s some fun music, and totally enjoyable... this is one of these cds you either you love or you hate...  introduced my friend to them, and he's all into this cd too<br />Tracks 1,2,6,7,9 and 11 are outstanding, which by no means the others are filler...<br />sometimes after singing along/Listening  to this, I get such a great feeling, i wonder if this is sonic LSD..LOL... nah, just kidding..
B0000524E5|1.0|This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.  <br />I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes.  Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.<br />If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library.  That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Even though I find this film kinda overrated,I did find things I enjoyed.The locales of Japan's biggest city.Bill Murray singing 'wHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT (PEACE,LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING}.I really liked Scarlet Johannson's performance.She's smart and has a enchanting sexiness that's just jake with me.I  seen her in a better film called,'GHOST WORLD'before this.I know the theme of this film,were all looking for someone to connect with emotionally,is sadly a  feeling many of us,young and old share in this modern world.I just didn't think this film broke any new ground.This is a good film but, 'GHOST WORLD'or a film I recently seen the amazing,'CITY OF GOD'is better.The  good thing about this film is it deals with real human feelings,something I find lacking in so many of  today's hollywood big films.Check out some of the other independent films.They don't get hyped,they don,t play in the multiplexes,you gotta sometimes look for em,but I find there's still compelling and  not brain dead films out there.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I LOVE this movie sooo much. You see, when you rate a movie that is adapted from a book, you have to look at it from two different perspectives. Interview with The Vampire as a movie was excellent. It was beautifully doet and the director, Neil Jordan, captured the gothic feel and look that the movie was supposed to have. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the vulnerable and torture fledgling vampire Louis and Kirsten Dunst gave a powerful (yet sometimes sappy) performance. While watching this movie you see that talented actress she has become and will be in the future.  TOm Cruise was good in potraying the evil that Lestat is supposed to harbor in his person.<BR>Now rating as an adaptation of the book is aa diffent story. I'm a big Anne RIce fan and I've read ALL of her books. THe writers changed many things that the book didnt have. I won't spoil it and give examples, but it's the truth. Antonio Banderas was miscast as the teenage vampire and ruler Armand. I say they could have done makeup on Louis to make him look more like Louis in the book.<BR>Other thatn those minor difference this is still a winner and I gaurantee you won't be disappointed. THe plot is good, the acting is good and you'll be able to follow the story.<BR>So sit back and enjoy.
B00007AJF8|5.0|I SEEN THIS AMAZING FILM IN A MULTIPLEX AND WENT HUH???I  TAPE IT OFF OF TV WEEN IT WAS ON HBO.I GET IT.THE GUY THAT WROTE THIS,CHARLIE KAUFFMAN IS A GENIUS.THIS IS A GREAT COMEDY AND EVERY TIME I WATCH IT.I SOMETHING TO CHUCKLE AT.SEE THIS FILM SEVERAL TIMES.IT'S A RICH TAPESTRY OF COMIC WRITING.SPIKE JONZE HAS DONE A FINE JOB IN 1ST FILM AFTER MANY INVENTIVE MUSIC VIDEOS.ALL THE ACTORS ARE GREAT.MY FAVORITES ARE ORSON BEAN,CATHERINE KEENER,CAMERON DIAZ AND THE ONE AND ONLY MR. MALKIVICH.THE SCENE WHERE HE GOES INTO HIS OWN PORTAL IS CLASSIC.I DON'T KNOW WHY SOME POSTERS HERE GIVE THIS FILM LESS THAN 5 STARS.A FILM LIKE 2001 OR BRAZIL IS TOO DEEP FOR THE COMMON MOVIE LOVER.THIS IS A GREAT FILM.IT HAS MOVIE SCRIPT LIKE CITIZEN KANE MOST SCRIPT WRITERS WOULD KILL TO MAKE!IT MAKES THE OVERRATED 'FIGHT CLUB'THE SHALLOW BRAIN DEAD TRASH IT REALLY IS.A REAL MAN COULD SEE THRU THAT BUNK.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a masterpiece of Dan Brown.  The plot is really good and I can't stop reading it.  The book is well-written and well-researched.  You would know that this book does not aim to be the best seller but it has every quality  of what good writing is all about. I love the way he conceptualized the book as fiction but mixed with elements of facts. It's been a long time that something like this has come out.  Buy this book, and you won't regret it!
B000002UAR|5.0|Yes The Beatles are greatest music group of all-time.They are the only artist in rock n roll history that made their cake and ate it too.I got all their cds. This is my favorite.John and Paul are at their songwriting peaks.The only song I dislike is 'I Want to tell you'by George.I hated 'Blue Jay Way' on 'The Magical Mystery Tour' too.I only wish they would do remaster job like they did  on  The Byrds entire work.Maybe they [The Beatles recond company] have plans in the upcoming future to do just that.When these cds were issued in the 80's they were primitve in remastering.The Beatles recorded in mono until ABBEY ROAD,which is the only true stereo album they made.The problem with early stereo is the 'ping pong' sonics.The Stones recently and Dylan issued 60's masterworks in  this state of art remastering.I would'nt be surprise if The Beatles entire discography is revamped and updated with this new advancement.If they can make The Stones 1st very crudely recorded lp sound remarkable ,God knows what they could do for more slickly recorded Beatles work.
B00003XB8K|4.0|Although this cd is not as good as the first three, i still enjoyed it . I do not beleive the previous judges really just sat back and listened to the music.Some people spend to much time analyzing things instead of just trying to enjoy it.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This has always been my favorite album, and since i bought it i have always ben a devoted Manson fan. It should appeal to anyone who likes rock, rap, metal or dance and can be listened to over and over again. The Best songs are: 1) I dont like the drugs, 2)Posthuman 3)I want to dissappar, 4)User Friendly and 5)Rock is Dead. Go and buy it now!<br />PS did anyone notice how &quot;Posthuman&quot; and &quot;I dont like the drugs&quot; sound exactly like David Bowie's &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; and &quot;Fame?&quot; Think about it!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I wish I could give them 20 stars. The group Linkin Park has taken rock to the next dimension.  This definetly is as good as Hybrid Theory if not slightly better.  I bought it and listened to it over and over again all week even when I slept.  If you rate this CD low you really need to get some taste in music cause you don't have any.  Linkin Park in concert in Columbus was awesome!!!!!  I saw them perform Meteora live and I loved the songs even more!  Go see them sometime then you'll see that Limp Biskit is nothing compared to linkin park!  Metallica is just as awesome so buy for them too.  You have got to be kidding me about comparing them though.  The older Metallica is possibly the greatest group ever and LP is a close 2nd.  Buy METEORA and HYBRID THEORY if you already haven't, and if you haven't your NUTS!!  GO LPU!!!!!!
B00005JMCN|4.0|Seabiscuit was one of the greatest horses in horse racing history.  His racing captivated America during the Great Depression, giving them an underdog they could identify with and root for.  Gary Ross' adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's bestseller does an excellent job of capturing the Americana set forth in the book.  The problem is that it is impossible to get into the details of Seabiscuit himself, the protagonists and the life surrounding the horse racing industry like the book in a 2 and 20-minute movie.  One is probably better off at seeing the movie first and then reading the book then the other way around, as there are big gaps between what happened in the book and what is shown on the screen.  That being said, Seabiscuit is still immensely entertaining.  The race scenes are exhilarating and they take you right on the horse's back.  The acting is also superb.  Tobey Maguire continues his rise as one the best young actors in movies.  Mr. Maguire has a strong likeability and one can't help but rooting for his character, jockey Red Pollard, to overcome his devastating injury.  Jeff Bridges is the master of the understated performance and gives yet another excellent turn as auto magnet Charles Howard.  William H. Macy is hilarious as he provides comic relief as the track reporter and announcer Tick Tock McGlaughlin.  While Chris Cooper is fine as trainer Tom Smith, but where as his character was a major player in the book, he seems regulated to a secondary role in the film.  Elizabeth Banks is luminous as Howard's second wife, Marcella, but she too suffers the fate of Mr. Cooper.  Two of the strongest performances are from off-screen.  David McCullough's narration adds depth and gravitas and Randy Newman's score is wistful and inspiring and continues to mark him as the best movie score composer.  Seabiscuit is the perfect family film that will appeal to all ages.
B00003CWNR|5.0|&quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is a great movie.  Engaging and touching throughout, it pulls you in immediately and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next.  Lasse Hallstrom's direction is just right, and the film is cast equally well.  Michael Caine does a great job (big surprise) as Dr. Wilbur Larch, the director of the Maine orphanage where a great deal of the story takes place.  He certainly deserved his Oscar for this role, and if I had seen the movie before that year's awards I certainly would have been rooting for him!<br />Charlize Theron is just right for the part of Candy, as is Paul Rudd as her husband Wally.  Singer Erykah Badu turns in an impressive performance as the daughter of the owner of the titular cider house.  But, in my opinion, the nicest  part of this film is Tobey Maguire, who plays the central character, Homer Wells.  The role seems to have been written for him.  Having seen him previously in &quot;Spider-Man,&quot; I wasn't really left with any particular impression of his abilities as an actor, but this movie totally sold me on him.  I'll watch anything else he's in now - who knows, I wouldn't even be surprised to find myself sitting through &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.<br />To sum up, this is a really worthwhile, multifaceted film - sometimes heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking (and sometimes both at once, which means you have a warm broken heart...).  Now I want to read John Irving's book!
B00009Z574|3.0|The hidden track (#18) on this issue has a mastering error which results in several &quot;ticks&quot; and skips. Some copies also have this problem with track # 17.  I'd wait until Rhino corrects this before buying it.
B00004XONN|4.0|When I first listened to this album, I quickly decided I hated it and moved on. After I got into Hail to the Thief I decided to give Kid A a second chance. This album is probably my favorite Radiohead album now. <BR>The dark futuristic theme in this alum relates very well to books I'm reading by William Gibson and it makes this album even more of a treat to listen too. If anyone has read Idoru then you might agree with me on the similarities between Radiohead and Lo/Rez it's very interesting to think about.<BR>Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I don't like Motion Picture Soundtrack, the beginning of the track is good but midway and near the end it kind of fizzles out. Also Treefingers isn't much to listen too, but it's useful to put it on repeat and sleep to it, very relaxing.<BR>All the other tracks on this album are top-quality. My favorite is probably Idioteque or Optimistic, well nevermind it's too hard to pick a favorite.<BR>If you listened to this album and decided you didn't like it, listen to it again...
1401300901|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  I was crying one minute and laughing out loud the next.  Being 31, married with two young children, it really makes me see things in a different light.  I don't know if I could be as strong as Holly was.  This was an awesome read.  I highly recommend it.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I am constantly asking my children what's new on the music scene.  I am dumb-founded at the success of Norah Jones, not seeing how her first album could sell 6 million copies, although it is nice enough. 1-2 million I could understand. How could she win all those Grammy's and Josh Groban not be nominated?   Her second album is alright as well.  Then my son, Jon, gave me two albums by Sara and I was captured, just as I was by Josh Groban. Josh's second album is a home run as well. I bought Sara's Afterglow which is just remarkable with Train Wreck being my favorite track. Some lyrics are  &quot;different&quot; but the talent and production is very good. The music industry is in such a state of flux right now, but I am glad I found her to reaffirm that there is still some music left to buy and worth owning. I have a pretty hi-resolution music system, but some slight over-production(reverb)  on her vocals make some lyrics hard to distinguish.  Still rates as 5 stars.  I hope she doesn't wait so long to make another album. <br />Jim Tavegia
B0001ENY6M|4.0|I thought the soundtrack to this film was good.  I enjoyed the music more so in the film than on CD, but it overall has some standout pieces that are heartbreakingly moving.  &quot;Crucifixion&quot; is by far the best piece on the track that is tear evoking and I think it is a really powerful piece.  I also think that &quot;Resurrection&quot; is a gorgeous piece as well that has an excellent and uplifting choir section.  Unfortunately, the trailer music John Debney composed for the trailer is not featured on this CD, which is disappointing because it is very moving.  If you like this, I would suggest Peter Gabriel's Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ which Debney's score is totally copied from for the most part.  Also, I would encourage listeners who enjoy this score to check out Lisa Gerrard and Patrick Cassidy's Immortal Memory which features some EXCELLENT pieces, many in Aramaic.  It would be a wonderful companion piece to this film's score and I think many listeners would find the same emotion, sadness, and beauty that is featured on The Passion of The Christ's score.
B0001611DI|4.0|First off,  ..., this movie is a SEQUEL!! as in any backstory you require is provided in the first movie (check out Night Of The Living Dead if your interested).  Secondly, painting the walls was the black guy's cunning play to through off the zombies (who are already too friggin' brain dead to survive an escalator) from finding the stairwell that their hiding in.  (Come on, there were in the mall for months ...  he probably didn't have much else to do). <br />   But honestly, if you didn't finish the flick, I don't think you have the knowledge to back yourself up.  The ending of this movie is great, especially the disembowling and consumption of the bikers.<br />   Yes, I'll admit the blue make-up is a little lacking by today's zombie effects standards, but I don't feel this movie to be just another B-zombie flick.  I regard it (as well as the first and third of the series) more of a post-apocalyptic survival story in which the protanganists must escape insurmountable odds by whatever means possible.<br />   Romero has given us three classic (for the lack of any better labelling) horror films that stand above the rest by the characterization and authenticity.  If all the dead of the world were to rise someday and proceed to eat the living, I'm convinced that these movies portray what would likable happen.  I'm sure Rastaman also overlooked the satirical comments throughout the films, supported by the sheer absurdity of the idea.  Maybe he'd prefer the ingenious weed-smoking catepillar of Freddy Vs. Jason.  Now that is clever!!<br />   Aside from everything else, Romero's DEAD trilogy stands up simply because there is nothing else like them (although the has been many, many, many mediocre attempts, most recently 28 Days Later ...), in terms of originality and zombies.  And, of course, there's plently brain-splatters and dismemberment just to keep things lively.<br />   If you're looking for modern horror flicks, with teenage girls being chased around by knife-wielding maniacs that end up being disgruntled ex-boyfriends, maybe these won't be for you, but if you want to see some true trend-setters of the B-movie horror flicks of the 80s and 90s, let me recommend the DEAD trilogy (Night Of The Living Dead (1968), Dawn Of The Dead (1979), and Day Of The Dead (1985)).
078322804X|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this movie that has not already been said. If you don't own or have never seen it--Get it immediately. This movie is a classic and it never gets old and it is always funny. What I love about this movie (aside from the music, the dialogue, the characters, the setting, the plot, etc, etc) is the realism of it all. It's one of those rare movies that presents itself as the real world, never breaks stride, and plays the whole thing straight, which is what makes it great and believable. I will ssy that The Blues Brothers is my favorite movie of all time and that The Blues Brothers 2000 is one of the worst, most pathetic, deplorable, disgusting sequels ever made. It's like the best vs. the worst.
B000002GJ7|5.0|This CD was released in 1990, just before the &quot;Nirvana revolution&quot; that pretty much rendered guitar crazed, long haired, flashy, overproduced bands like Extreme extinct.  I recently bought the CD again and I have to say, even though it sounds dated, I loved it as much as I did when I was in high school! The songwriting was what set Extreme apart from the other bands of the day. Not to mention Nuno's extremely fat , in your face, guitar playing. In my opinion I dont think any of there other CDs were as successful as Pornograffitti and it stands as the finest example of 80s over the topness.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD was awesome, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have amazing voices, the songs are really catchy, and the musical was fantastic, go see it!
B000092ZYX|5.0|There are generally two schools of thought when it comes to Radiohead.  Those that admire everything they do and consider them to be the best band in the world - and those that think they lost their minds from &quot;Kid A&quot; onwards.  While personally I tend to side with the &quot;greatest living band&quot; fans, this record should appease anybody whose ever dug  Radiohead to any degree.  Thats to say that while, most Radiohead records have stuck to a formula and have sounded very cohesive - this one branches out and is more all over the map sonically and texturally.  <br />In terms of artistic merit, the songs on HTTT stand up to any other Radiohead record and in most cases exceed them.  &quot;2+2=5&quot; gets the record off in fine fashion showcasing the band in top form as it melds electronic rock with one of Thom's finest vocal performances ever.  The next 4 tracks are classic RH with &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; &amp;  &quot;Go To Sleep&quot; delivering melodies so lush, they're sure to not be forgotten anytime soon.  Other favorites include the single &quot;There There&quot; and the droning &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;<br />This record has the songs &amp; qualities to stand the test of time- and 20 years from now I believe many people will be hailing this record as Radiohead's masterpiece.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|Where \\"Lost in Translation\\" showed us a complex giving relationship between an older man and a younger woman, \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is unrepentantly nasty about such relationships, which it sees as inevitably a character flaw in the older man. <br />At the same time it wants to have its cake and eat it by making no such criticisms of relationships between older woman and younger men. <br />It's not hard to see that the audience demographic for this movie is baby boom women who don't much like the idea that many men of their generation are now dating younger ones, but heartily applaud Cher and Demi Moore for their May/December romances. <br />In \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" Jack Nicholson's Harry Langer gets criticised for his interest in younger women. Frances McDormand as a woman's studies teacher laments that older men can date younger women but that older single women can't get dates at all. A former husband, played by Paul Michael Glaser, is criticised for wanting to remarry - inevitably - a younger woman. <br />Yet despite that, not only does Nicholson's character finally fall for older female playwright Erica Barry, played by Diane Keaton, so does Harry's young doctor Julian, played by Keanu Reeves. (And Keanu Reeves as a doctor, and an enthusiastic and astute intellectual judge of plays, is perhaps the film's biggest single bad joke.)  <br />But even the better actors are disappointing. Jack Nicholson just does his Nicholson as bad boy schtick, a far remove from his superb performance in \\"Schmidt\\". Oscar nominated or not, Keaton gasps a lot. <br />It's an awful audience-pandering film, and one that will enjoyed pretty much only by precisely that sector of the female audience to which it is pandering. And it's set in a bizarre fantasy world. Doesn't writer and director Nancy Meyers know that Broadway is a highly competitive place these days, and that plays like the stuff Keaton's character writes wouldn't even get an off-Broadway venue? And yet we're to believethat Erica has got filthy rich from doing this kind of stuff. <br />And then there's the movie's double standard which merely reverses old sexist attitudes and replaces them with new ones.  Older men and younger women bad. Older women and younger men fine. <br />In the end though the film dissatisfies even those who uphold this new double standard. It's even more conservative than that. Date within five years of your own age people. Even some women critics, to whom you might expect this movie to appeal, have said they don't believe the final scene for a second. Neither do I. <br />In the nineteen-fifties Douglas Sirk directed the wonderful \\"All that Heaven Allows\\", in which a middle-aged Jane Wyman fell for a young Rock Hudson. It was a plea for openness in judging the relationships of others, and it's sometimes depressing to realise that in some ways, and particularly in some PC ways, Hollywood is more conservative now than it was in those days, merely replacing the prejudices of one era with those of another. <br />Like many others, I lament the fact that Hollywood puts many fine actresses out to seed too early. I do wish we had more romances involving older men AND women. I quite liked - for instance - Australian directors Paul Cox's \\"Innocence\\" which was about a love affair between two people in their seventies. But, even - or maybe especially - those of us who'd like to see movies skewed a little less to youth audiences deserve a lot better than the audience pandering of \\"Something's Gotta Give\\".
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth is one of those very few bands that when you hear them you know that you are witness to something truly amazing and in my opinion Blackwater Park takes it to the next level.I'm a fan of all their work but this album is so huge and cinimatic I never get sick of it[I even bought the limited edition as well].If you are looking for an audio thrillride and are a real metal/prog/music fan[by the way Ken, Gade8 are hardly in the same league as Opeth-can you say grade-b Machine Head?]buy this album-and then buy the rest of them.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I just have to say this its the best soundtrack I have seen this year. The sounds of the music brings you to the movie. A GREAT MIVE! This its a must have!
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Look.  I am not going to touch on any of the lyrics of this CD.  Neil Morse can sing about anything he wants to, as long as the tunes carry the day.  On this CD the tunes carry it.<br />I feel as though this is a seriously strong outing from NM.  I really enjoy the captivating energy that the music has.  Lets face it, for something to be prog, it has to be majestic, and this is very majestic.  All the great Prog Bands (Yes, Kansas, Flower Kings, Spocks Bears, King Crimson, Dream Theatre) all have elements that make them majestic, they tower above everything in music while playing music.  The competitive spirit of competent musicians really sets PROG apart... and this CD does.<br />I feel as though a lot of the folks reviewing this CD seem to get mixed up on whether they like the message of what Neil is singing.. and lets face it, if you listened to Spocks Beard and listen to this, there is not much different going on here (Beware of Darkness... Snow was really an embryonic version of this TESTIMONY CD) and a lot of people have wondered just why Neil Morse left Spocks Beard when he really could have done this CD with them... of course many people think he did, when he made Snow...<br />All that aside, this is a great CD, and the music is second to none.  The guitar is exceptionally great on this CD.  The solo's are really energetic, and captivating.  Of course the keys are good, but the balance of the guitars with a chorus of background singers on songs really add to the power of the overall theme and that is MUSIC IS THE BEST.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The bass player is inept?  Are you joking?  Sure, he takes a minimalist approach to the songs just like all of the other players in the band, but the guy is awesome.  Him and Fab are incredibly tight both live and in the studio, and his parts are expertly crafted and go perfectly with the songs.  Check out the bass lines on &quot;Is This It?&quot; and &quot;New York City Cops&quot; on their first cd if you still have doubt.  Anyway, back to this album.  All of the songs are nice and catchy and upbeat.  This is what I bought the album for, and I think that's what it is intended to be - a fun, well thought out rock album.  The Strokes have never claimed to be the &quot;saviors of rock,&quot; that's just something other people have attached to them, and I don't think they should be held accountable to it.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Finally the only version you will ever need of this horror classic has been released. It has never looked or sounded better. Up until now, the unrated version has been tough to find anywhere. The bonus materials are also top notch. I would have to say that this is one of the top 10 DVD's out there right now. No complaints here. Enjoy!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Back in the day, Disney made some great animated films.  In fact, you know it's decent if it was made when Walt Disney was still alive.  Now, it's a money grubbing corporation cranking out flix and merchandise for $$ like Full Moon Productions.  I mean, c'mon!  Lion King 2?  Little Mermaid 2?  Lady and the Tramp 2?  Aladdin 3?  Cinderella 2?  At least twenty different versions of 101 Dalmations?  Lets wake up here.  Disney used to put out some fantastic films, and Alice In Wonderland is right there at the top.  It's the most experimental and disturbing of the Disney features.  It's also hilarious!  Naturally it doesn't follow the book(s) 100%, but I don't think I've ever seen an adaptaion of Alice that has(if Terry Gilliam got ahold of the rights, THEN you'd see something spectacular!).  Some reviewers whine about how this is \\"boring\\", \\"confusing\\" and \\"inappropriate for children.\\"  Grow up, will ya?  It's Alice In Wonderland, not Eraserhead!  What kind of adult is \\"confused\\" by a Disney film that my daughter can follow?  Believe me, this movie will NOT corrupt or traumatize your child.  You have the Stanley Runk guarantee on that.  Unless your child is a genius and more educated in the ways of the world than you are, they will not pick up on any kind of drug references.  And it won't inspire your daughter to smoke a cigar if she sees a talking walrus doing it.  My daughter and I watch this all the time.  We laugh, we sing, we quote it, we have more fun with this film than any other Disney film.  To my knowledge she hasn't started smoking cigars yet.  So put that in your hookah and smoke it, Mister!  If you haven't seen this(unlikely), pick it up for sure.  It's so enjoyable and made in a time when Disney took chances and didn't adhere to the moronic P.C. formulas they do today.
B0000CGV00|5.0|All of the reviewers before me (sans the idiot from Detroit) have given rave and well thought reviews to this disc.  I'm just here to balance out the 3 stars given by the idiot from Detroit and to say that the rendition of Beethoven Op. 31 on this disc is one of the best I've heard.

0060977493|4.0|This novel is everything that the many reviewers, both positive and negative, say it is.  That is because it overflowing with things both good and bad; it is all superabundance, superfluity and sometimes surfeit. Suzanna Arundhati Roy is a phenomenally gifted young writer simply gushing with words and perceptions, but unable to resist them, contain them, or cut them down with the cruel, revising severity of an older master. And so the reader, happy for the rich fare, but feeling a bloat coming on from the excess of sweets and carbohydrates, must pass by the later servings with some degree of displeasure.  Yet, overall, it's not right to turn up your nose at a feast.<br /><br />The most difficult part of the repast is the beginning. THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS, following the model of Salman Rushdie's THE MOOR'S LAST SIGH, is very much a novel about family relationships.  The author apparently wants the reader to enter the story in media res, as if suddenly transported to Southwestern India and stuck in a village without explanation.  That device works up to a point, but beyond it precise information is needed as to who is who and how everyone is related.  Roy never gives a decent accounting and seems almost spitefully to mix things up. As I read I found that I had to make a list of the characters and constantly revise it.  An explanatory cast of characters should appear at the front of the book, but since it does not I think the best service I can provide to prospective readers is to offer my list. It is based mostly on early information, so does not give the story away:<br /><br />SETTING:  the Hindu village of Ayemenem (not on maps), near Kottayam (on some maps) in the State of Kerala, which lines the southwestern tip of India; the village is two hours distant from the coastal town of Cochin (on detailed maps).  The language is Malayalam.<br /><br />MAIN CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Soshamma Mammachi--the grandmother, owns a pickle factory called \\"Paradise.\\"<br />Papachi--the grandfather, 17 years older, a retired government entomologist.<br /><br />Ammu--daughter of Mammachi and Papachi, mother of the twins, divorced from Baba, 27 years old in 1969.<br />Baba--the alcoholic father, goes to work in Calcutta and takes his son Estha with him; then 23 years later returns him to Ayemenem and moves to Australia.<br /><br />Estha (Esthappen Yako)--their son, first of the dizygotic twins, born November 1962.<br />Rahel--their daughter, second of the dizygotic twins by 18 minutes; she marries and divorces the architect Larry McCaslin and returns to Ayemenem from America when she learns that Estha has returned.<br /><br />Chako--only son of Mammachi and Papachi, brother of Ammu, uncle of the twins, a Rhodes scholar at Oxford.<br />Margaret Kochamma--English ex-wife of Chako.<br />Sophie Mol--their daughter, dead at 9, cousin to the twins.<br /><br />Velutha (\\"white\\")--son of Vellya Paapen, born 1945, a Paravan (untouchable), handyman and carpenter.<br /><br />Baby Kochamma (Navomi Ipe)--sister of Papachi, grand aunt of the twins, once a Roman Catholic nun (not related to Margaret Kochamma).<br />E. John Ipe--her father, blessed as a boy by the Patriarch of Antioch, head of the Syrian Christian Church.<br />Kochin Maria--her midget maid.<br /><br />The above list gives dates and ages as the author provides them, but try as you might it is awfully hard to determine exactly what are the years of the two main planes of action. The author likes to shift from one to the other, so that a sense of timelessness is created, but once certain dates are given it is irritating not to have the chief ones, and one cannot escape the feeling that the author is being intentionally obscure. Possibly she could write the whole thing in Malayalam and the Malayalam reader would grasp everything, but if the medium is English then some concessions to the wider foreign culture should be made.<br /><br />All the same, there are wonderful things here.  Roy, being fearless,lapses on occasion into bad taste, revoltingly bad taste, but in her best moments achieves a sublime portrayal of life as severe and unsparing as Joseph Conrad.  The reader inclined by her child's-point-of-view narrative to place all good in childhood and all evil in maturity should reflect on a little scene in which two girls are stepping on ants: one wants to kill them all, but the other wants to leave one so \\"it will be lonely.\\"  Here, as in other scenes, is the remorseless eye of a great artist.ife as severe and unsparing as Joseph Conrad.

0684803356|5.0|I like this Hemingway book even better than A Farewell to Arms. It \\"stayed with me\\" long after I had forgotten most of the details. I read the book as a university freshman, then reread it after it came strongly to mind in summer 1987. I was standing on a steep, green meadow in Schwarzwald, reshuffling the deck of life. Like a Hemingway character, I was traveling around Europe living an adventure.<br />Descriptions of many scenes are memorable. Reading as a twenty year old, dynamiting the bridge and the part where Maria crawls under the blanket with Robert Jordan were the strongest. One still likes those descriptions twenty-five years later, but one then also pays attention to the long description of old dead roses as the essence of the odor of death. And one never forgets the powerful ending. Here's how I remembered the ending before rereading it yesterday: Robert Jordan, mortally wounded, sends the pregnant Maria toward safety with the rest of his escaping band of comrades. Lying on his stomach on the steep meadow, as Franco's fascist troops come up the hillside into sight, he pulls back the bolt and takes a bead on the lead officer on horseback ....<br />Because all dialogues in the book should take place in Spanish, Hemingway wrote partly in the early seventeenth century English of John Donne (readers familiar with the king James Version of the Bible, translated early in the seventeenth century, will easily recognize the language). This has the advantage of giving the reader the sensation of reading 'not-English'.<br />It's still a very powerful book. In the context of history, Hemingway was impregnated with the Teddy Roosevelt brand of heroism.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Please note this set just covers George's Dark Horse Years - hence the title, and thus this set does not include his releases before (ex. All Things Must Past and Dark Horse).    But, the albums that have been included in this set have not been available for awhile - they were out of print for a long time.    Nicely remastered, great photos and reproductions of the covers.  The only thing I missed in this set was the song \\"Cheer Down\\", but I believe that that track wasn't on any of the albums here anyways other than the \\"Best of Dark Horse album\\" which is out of print.    Great set!  Oh, and the DVD is pretty nice too!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I am a young music fan (17) and I cant see what all the fuss is over the Beatles. Ive always heard how amazingly brilliant these guys were and that anything else is just a cheap imitation of what they started years before. Im very open to all kinds of music , as my parents have a huge collection of music from all over the world from from all genres ( no Beatles sorry !! ).I have heard some of their stuff on the radio but I thought I should buy an entire cd just to see what  the fuss is about. I guess its just a matter of taste but I found myself waiting for this cd to end.Ok , some of the songs are not bad ,but nothing that rocked my world thats for sure !.Maybe because of my exposure to more different styles of music than the average person who solely listens to the era from 1954-2004 ,I see it for what it really is - average radio stuff.At the same time I bought this cd I also bought &quot; Elvis-30# 1s &quot; which I ended up loving. I found his music more uplifting and he had an incredible voice. Its all a matter of taste, but I feel the Beatles might be just a tad overrated,and I think if people experimented with styles of music separate from Rock/pop they would discover some stuff that they would love.The Beatles are not the most revolutionary artists of the century ,not by a long shot.Maybe in Rock music they made an impact , but Rock music is not the only style of music ,there are whole other worlds of music that are just as important, if not more.
B000127LW2|5.0|Star trek Voyager is my first DVD season collection. Though I have lots of movies I had to get Voyager season 1 when paramount announced that they were releasing the whole series on DVD! And I am happy to say that I am SATISFIED. I just finished viewing all the discs and the quality of both video and Audio are quite good. Yes the Bass is not too good but then thats how it was even on TV! So theres not much reason to complain if you enjoy the show. Coming back to the episodes they were mostly good in the first season but the real good ones are there in season 3 and season 5. Anyhow I plan to get all the seasons on DVD. I also see from the packing that Paramount is releasing the original Star trek series on DVD. That should be interesting . Before I go kudos to Amazon for their superb shipping! I pre-ordered and received my copy on 26th through expedited shipping! By the way I am from India!! Keep up the great work guys. And to all prospective buyers here is what I say &quot; Buy the DVD set if you like Voyager. You will not be disappointed.
037542217X|4.0|Precious Ramotswe, founder of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana is faced with several problems in this, the fourth and latest volume of the international best-selling series by Mr. Smith. First of all, Mma. Ramotswe has competition when another detective agency comes into town run by a man who feels women are second rate. His credentials are a bit suspect. I.e.. He claims to have had detective training in some large cities including New York. Second, her assistant, Mma. Makutsi, has started a typing school for men and has met a wonderful man who claims to love her. The question is who is he and is he trustworthy. These problems will all be solved prior to the ending of this delightful little novel.<br />  The term \\"cozy\\" was made for this type of book. There is no bloodletting or violence of any kind. It is purely character driven and what charming and polite characters they are! The books are slight enough that we get to know the characters, the problems they must solve, and the resolution before the book ends in a length perfect for one sitting. I fully understand the popularity of these books.  They remind the reader of the Golden Age of mystery fiction.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I've been a Bill Murray fan for many years.  I expect great comedy  from him, always.  I was very disappointed in this film, and quite frankly, don't see what all the hype is about.  The film was long and boring.  What a waste of money.
0679428895|3.0|The year is 79 AD and the place is the Bay of Naples.  The flow of water from the aquaducts have been interrupted leaving several towns without any water supply. It is up to the engineer, Marius Attilius Primus, who is in charge of the proper functioning of the aquaduct, to find out what happened. The problem is a potential catastrophe in that the water has been interrupted to over a quarter of a million people. In addition, sulpher gases have begun to appear from underground conduits and minor earthquakes have become more numerous. Attiilus soon fears an eruption of nearby Mt. Vesuvius. He must go to Pompeii for men and supplies to attempt to repair the aquaduct until his fears prove to be real.<BR>     Using an aquaduct engineer as a main protagonist is an original and inspired idea. This proves to be an excellent way to highlight the politics and city life at the time off the eruption. The problem with the book was that the plot was not thrilling enough to keep the pages turning. Interesting but not thrilling.
B00005G95H|5.0|1983's The Final Cut not only has the distinction of being front man Roger Waters' last recording with Pink Floyd nor the only one not to utilize Richard Wright's keyboards, which, shockingly, doesn't hurt from their absence; it is also quite simply their best work-without a single radio hit. Dedicated to bassist/writer Waters' father Eric Fletcher, who died in combat during World War II before they met, the concept album is a self-proclaimed \\"requiem for the post war dream.\\"<br />From the first track, \\"The Post War Dream,\\" the listeners realize they're in for a treat. Beginning with a sparse musical arrangement, Waters enters almost a cappella, lamenting his father's loss and blaming himself for, among other things, his disappearance and even Jesus' crucifixion. In one of his best-penned lines, Waters asks: \\"Was it you?/Was it me?/Did I watch too much T.V.?\\" True Floyd fans will understand the hint that most of their concept albums, including this one, The Wall, and even Wish You Were Here, feature a buzzing television set in the background.<br />The subject matter of \\"One of the Few\\" echoes the lyrical content of Waters' often played \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II).\\" Taking a potshot at teachers coming home from the war, Waters sings: \\"Make them me/Make them you/Make them do what you want them to.\\"<br />\\"The Hero's Return\\" starts off with a strong enough melody but eventually loses its way, suffering from too many dynamics. It's quite a shame; under a different direction, the song could have been transformed into a Floyd classic in the tradition of \\"Money\\" or \\"Hey You.\\" \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" and \\"Paranoid Eyes\\" are propped up midway by stunning guitar solos by David Gilmour, the first one electric and the latter acoustic, highlighted by Nick Mason's frenetic drumming.<br />\\"The Gunner's Dream,\\" Floyd's best song ever-at least the band's greatest narrative-is a mini-masterpiece. Based on the story of a gunner whose plane is shot down in action, the five-minutesong manages to pack as much emotional intensity and drama as a two-hour opera. As the title character parachutes down to the earth, he reminisces about his life, including witnessing his own funeral, knowing that death is near. In the aftermath, and not unlike Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speech, he poses a dream to mankind that would take someone made of granite not to be moved. The song also happens to include the most incredible saxophone solo of any Floyd tune, courtesy of Raphael Ravenscroft, which takes the melody, literally, to new heights.<br />\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" lists a bunch of political figures who, Waters believes, were responsible for the woes of the late 20th Century, among them Margaret Thatcher, Richard Nixon, and even Ronald Reagan. Stepping briefly into dark hyperbole, Waters wishes a \\"final solution\\" upon the residents of the fictional home named after his father. The throwaways \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\" and \\"Southampton Dock\\" accurately paint pictures of anger and loss, respectively.<br />Although the title track borrows the Michael Kamen string orchestration of The Wall's \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" it's powerful nonetheless and fun just to hear Waters guiltily admit: \\"There's a kid who had a big hallucination/Making love to girls in magazines.\\" Later on, he opens his heart in a rare but beautiful sentiment: \\"And if I show you my dark side/Would you still hold me tonight?\\" The explosive, near bombastic \\"Not Now John\\" surprisingly features the mother of all curse words in the chorus and even a Waters-style rap.<br />The last track, \\"Two Suns in the Sunset,\\" wraps up the war-torn theme nicely, illustrating an apocalyptic vision of a nuclear bomb mirroring a sunset (\\"The sun is in the east/Even though the day is done\\"). Waters ends this solid, dozen-track album with a frightening realization that still rings true, especially in today's unprecedented times: \\"Ashes and diamonds/Foe and friend/We were all equal in the end.\\"
0385512104|5.0|Christopher, the fifteen year old narrator of this remarkable debut novel, suffers with Asperger's Syndrone, a form of autism. One night he goes into his backyard and discovers his neighbor's dog dead with a pitchfork through it's body. Christopher, who loves mysteries, especially Sherlock Holmes, decides that he will solve this murder on his own. He travels the neighborhood trying to discover the cause of the dog's death in spite of the repeated admonitions from his father. What follows is a tale of discovery- not only about the murder of the dog but about what life is like with a severe form of autism.<BR>     Not since MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN by Jonathan Lethem has mental illness been so sensitively and accurately depicted. This remarkable book allows the reader to get inside the head of an mentally impaired individual to discover how they think and what motivates them to behave the way they do. For instance, Christopher feels it will be a great day or a terrible day depending on how many Red vs. Yellow cars he sees. He doesn't like to be touched and as such never gets physically close to anyone. He is a math genius in spite of his other limitations. Through Christopher's eyes, the world is full of strangers that cannot be trusted. He carries a penknife with him for protection and will defend his personal space no matter the cost even if it involves hitting a policeman. His mother and father obviously love him but the tragedy is they are frustrated by their strong feelings of inadequacy in taking care of him. In fact, it is this feeling of inadequacy and lack of confidence that drives the events that unfurl in this story. The book is relatively slight yet packs a major whollop. Wonderful.
B00009WNVV|3.0|Je n'ai rien à redire contre le film. Surréaliste, flamboyant et merveilleusement interprété, c'est l'un des meilleurs films de la dernière année, juste derrière Moulin Rouge. Catherine Zeta-Jones, en femme fatale déchue, nous montre des talents surprenants de danseuse et de chanteuse, et Renée Zellweger, si elle n'a pas le physique et la voix de sa partenaire, parvient à rendre attachant un personnage de femme-enfant ambitieuse, menteuse, égoïste et ingrate. L'ambiance &quot;années folles&quot; des numéros musicaux contraste étonnament bien avec la misère du milieu carcéral.  Certains ont critiqué le réalisateur en disant que son procédé (alternance entre vie réelle et numéros spectaculaires sortis de l'imagination des personnages) était directement copié sur &quot;Dancer in the dark&quot;, mais avec une telle histoire, je ne vois pas comment on aurait pu le raconter autrement. Et que dire des costumes, et de la musique!! All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango et le numéro du ventriloque sont des petits bijoux. Le film provoque de plus une intéressante réflexion sur le système de justice et la manipulaiton des médias. Seuls les éternels réfractaires aux comédies musicales n'appécieront pas. <br />Seule condition: il faut absolument le regarder en anglais. Le doublage en français n'est absolument pas à la hauteur. Les dialogue perdent beaucoup de leur saveur, les voix ne transmettent pas du tout la même intensité; quant aux chansons, elles deviennent banales et caricaturales. La reprise des chansons anglaises avec ajout de sous-titres français, comme on l'avait fait dans Moulin Rouge, aurait été préférable.  <br />La version DVD, malheureusement, laisse, beaucoup à désirer. C'est ce qui m'a obligée à baisser ma cote. Pour mettre en valeur ce grand film, lauréat de nombreux Oscars, on ne retrouve qu'un seul misérable documentaire sur le tournage, pas très long d'ailleurs, et quelques trailers promotionnels de films à venir.Pas d'entrevues avec les acteurs, pas d'infos supplémentaires sur la comédie musicale originale, sur son auteur, pas de galleries de photos. &quot;Chicago&quot; méritait un meilleur traitement. Il est à souhaiter qu'une édition spéciale soit préparée bientôt, même s'il s'agit d'un procédé de marketing détestable.
0060516402|5.0|Heard the taped version of BUILT TO LAST by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras, a research study that looked at what made certain \\"visionary companies\\" special when compared to others who were \\"successful but second rank\\" . . . thus, Disney was compared to Columbia Pictures, Ford to GM, etc.<br />The comparisons made the material real for me . . . there were lots of examples, and they helped me see that the key to the success of any organization is not just its leader . . . to quote the authors:<br />The key point is that a visionary company is an organization--an institution. All individual leaders, no matter how charismatic or visionary, eventually die; and all visionary products and services--all \\"great ideas\\"--eventually become obsolete. Indeed, entire markets can become obsolete and disappear. Yet visionary companies  prosper over long periods of times, through multiple product life cycles and multiple generations of active leaders.<br />Why that is so is because they did not fall susceptible to the myths that too many other companies buy into, such as:<br />1. It takes a great idea to start a company.<br />2. Visionary companies require great and charismatic visionary leaders.<br />3. The most successful companies exist first and foremost to maximize profits.<br />4. Visionary companies share a common subset of \\"correct\\" core values.<br />5. The only constant is change.<br />6. Blue-chip companies play it safe.<br />7. Visionary companies are great places to work, for everyone.<br />8. Highly successful companies make some of their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning.<br />9. Companies should hire outside CEOs to stimulate fundamental change.<br />10. The most successful companies focus primarily on beating the competition.<br />11. You can't have your cake and eat it too.<br />12. Companies become visionary primarily through \\"vision statements.\\"<br />I'd recommend this book to anybody working in business--or who someday aspires to do so . . . it will make you think.you think.
B00005JLXE|4.0|&quot;A man without fear is a man without hope.&quot;<br />Okay, it's not Shakespeare, but for a baby boomer who lost track of Daredevil back in 1969, it's great fun to see my favorite hero at his CGI best.  Back then I preferred Marvel over DC comics, simply because I preferred two-fisted action over complex plots.  Trying to figure out what Lex Luthor and Braniac were up to in Superman dramas just wasn't any fun.  I also thought Marvel's writing and artwork were far superior.  Although I religiously read several Marvel titles, including Ironman, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange, I especially looked forward to the Fantastic Four, which was written and drawn by two Marvel legends, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  At the time Lee wrote just about everything, while the FF4 was clearly Kirby's flagship.  His massively muscled super beings and fantastic layouts were in stark contrast to Gene Colan's frantic free-style panels featured in Daredevil and Dracula.  I found his sketches oddly appealing and a perfect fit for DD, who's bizarre double-life seemed more than a little sketchy at times.  But, let's face it.  The built-in pathos of a blind super heroe was just too irresistable, and DD quickly rose above the others as my number one super guy.<br />So, after 35 years, I was anxious to see if the movie would do anything for me.  And, I'm happy to report, It did.  I thought Affleck did a fine job, going from naive &quot;save the world&quot; pro bono lawyer to a masked vigilante with action-star ease (even though it seemed out of character at the time)  While the Kingpin was a regular villain in the 60s, Bullseye was new to me.  I thought the &quot;man without fear&quot; versus the &quot;man who can't miss&quot; subplot was great.  Farrell is another UK actor who can do it all.  I thought Garner did well as Elektra, although I had a hard time seeing her as a master assasin.  I guess I was looking for a more menacing figure, larger, more powerful, etc...  The soundtrack, although not my genre, seemed to add some spice to DD's patented sky-scraper swan dives.  Speaking of which:  Just like in Spider-Man, there were a few instances where the real actor and the CGI counterpart were not exactly seemless.  We can blame Lord of the Rings for raising our perfect CGI expectations.<br />Anyway, I think it worked.  Sequel?  Jeez, I hope so.  I just don't know how they're going to top Bullseye.  That was right up there with the Joker, minus a ton of dialogue.  Superhero fans have to love this stuff.  Of course, some will like their fare and bit more lighthearted.  I, for one, lean toward the dark side.  Let DC work out happy endings.  Just make mine Marvel!
B00000K19E|5.0|The movie that started it all. The Matrix came completely out of the blue. No one had ever heard of the directors, the Wachowski brothers. Their only other movie directorial effort was Bound, which no one ever saw. (Turns out, Bound was simply an audition to prove to the studios that they knew how to direct and could handle the project that was The Matrix). The actors were a mixed bag of good actors (Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano), bad actors (Keanu Reeves) and then unknown actors (Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving). The previews gave nothing away. You were simply left with the question What Is The Matrix? and a few images of some very cool action. The only thing I knew at the time was that I HAD to go see the movie the night it was released.<br />Before I go any further, I need to make a confession. I am the target demographic for this movie. As such, my opinion of this movie is biased from the word go. I love video games, I like kung fu, I like science fiction, I like comic books, and I like technology. The one overwhelming mantra of The Matrix is that the Wachowski brothers use everything, pop culture, religion, video games, you name it and blend it all together to make something new. Since they used all the things that I like already, the movie was a wicked cocktail that hooked me from the instant I tasted it. I loved the story, the action, the cinematography, even the acting.<br />Fishburne and Joey Pants are great character actors and I tend to love their work regardless of the film their in. Keanu Reeves is a different story. Other than the Bill & Ted movies, Keanus acting hasnt been all that good. Johnny Mnemonic was a bomb in no small part thanks to Keanus lack of skill as an actor. Hes stiff, doesnt convey a lot of emotion and his delivery is stilted. His main redeeming quality is that he looks good. All his negatives became positives in the Wachowskis hands. The character of Neo is one where you need someone stiff and emotionless, but looks good as hes kicking ....... Keanu more than fits the bill. This was the role he was meant to play.<br />The story was good, but the storytelling was the hallmark for me. For many people the cinematography was all new to them. Some people had never seen camera angles like they found in the Matrix, but I had in comic books and in Japanese Animation aka anime. In comic books, the method of storytelling is done through still images. Although that may sound somewhat stilted, it can actually give some freedom because each frame and show you more detail, slow things down, or speed things up. If anything it gives you a wide latitude with perspective. Anime takes a similar approach because much of anime is done on such a small budget. For example, one trick that anime uses is to take a still image and have the camera move from left to right. This gives the impression of movement, but its really just a single still image. These tricks created an entire style that anime still uses today even though the budget may be bigger.<br />The Wachowskis came from a comic book background, and one of the things that they were trying to do was bring some of the storytelling style from comic books and anime to the silver screen. Trinitys jump, bullet time, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith in the subway are all examples of 2d comic book and Japanese anime style that was realized in film. Motion pictures, comic books and animation are all simply mediums to tell a story. The Wachowski brothers blended the styles and blurred the lines between the mediums.<br />The techniques that the directors used in the Matrix changed film as we know it. Hardly any action movie today doesnt use kung fu wire work. Charlies Angels, The Rundown, and even Le Pacte des Loups all used the fighting style made popular in The Matrix. Star Wars may have been a landmark movie because it changed how science fiction was done, but The Matrix did that and more. The ripple effect of this movie has left its mark on so many filmakers that its hard to watch any action or science fiction film and not see touches of The Matrix in them.<br />In 1999 the Wachowski brothers released a landmark film that changed film, and to some extent our culture, forever. It came out of the blue and blew us all away. It would be four years before their story could continue, but it was all worth the wait.
B00005JLXE|4.0|&quot;A man without fear is a man without hope.&quot;<br />Okay, it's not Shakespeare, but for a baby boomer who lost track of Daredevil back in 1969, it's great fun to see my favorite hero at his CGI best.  Back then I preferred Marvel over DC comics, simply because I preferred two-fisted action over complex plots.  Trying to figure out what Lex Luthor and Braniac were up to in Superman dramas just wasn't any fun.  I also thought Marvel's writing and artwork were far superior.  Although I religiously read several Marvel titles, including Ironman, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange, I especially looked forward to the Fantastic Four, which was written and drawn by two Marvel legends, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  At the time Lee wrote just about everything, while the F4 was clearly Kirby's flagship.  His massively muscled super beings and out-of-this-world layouts were in stark contrast to Gene Colan's frantic free-style panels featured in Daredevil and Dracula.  I found his sketches oddly appealing and a perfect fit for DD, who's bizarre double-life seemed more than a little sketchy at times.  But, let's face it.  The built-in pathos of a blind super hero was just too irresistable, and DD quickly rose above the others as my number one super guy.<br />So, after 35 years, I was anxious to see if the movie would do anything for me.  And, I'm happy to report, it did.  I thought Affleck did a fine job, going from naive &quot;save the world&quot; pro bono lawyer to a masked vigilante with action-star ease (even though it seemed out of character at the time).  While the Kingpin was a regular villain in the 60s, Bullseye was new to me.  I thought the &quot;man without fear&quot; versus the &quot;man who can't miss&quot; subplot was great.  Farrell is another UK actor who can do it all.  I thought Garner did well as Elektra, although I had a hard time seeing her as a master assasin.  I guess I was looking for a more menacing figure, larger, more powerful, etc...  The soundtrack, although not my genre, seemed to add some spice to DD's patented sky-scraper swan dives.  Speaking of which:  Just like in Spider-Man, there were a few instances where the real actor and the CGI counterpart were not exactly seemless.  We can blame Lord of the Rings for raising our perfect CGI expectations.<br />Anyway, I think it worked.  Sequel?  Jeez, I hope so.  I just don't know how they're going to top Bullseye.  That was right up there with the Joker, minus a ton of dialogue.  Superhero fans have to love this stuff.  Of course, some will like their fare and bit more lighthearted.  I, for one, lean toward the dark side.  Let DC work out happy endings.  Just make mine Marvel!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Some people have complained this is a dull, boring film.  Others say this is simply a slow-paced artful film that only sensitive intelligent folks will get.  Is LIT one of the latter?   <br />In LIT, Scarlett Johansson portrays Sofia Coppola in this apparently autobiographical film.  In the film, Johannson sits around in her hotel most of the time (in TOKYO!!!), despondent over her failing marriage to her emotionally distant photographer husband (ie.Coppola's ex - Spike Jonze).  He seems to enjoy the lighthearted phony company of Cameron Diaz....I mean, the character who plays a Diaz-like actress.  Anyway Charlotte (that's the Johannson/Coppola character) rolls her eyes whenever she speaks, so we the viewers, will know to prefer the less-vulgar and sensitive Charlotte.  Why cannot her husband see that his own wife, while displaying no intelligent ideas or thoughts or emotions, is the preferrable one to hang around with?!  I mean, Charlotte IS beautiful, but like many beautiful women she is actually VERY sad.  She admits to Bob (more about him later) that she has no idea what she wants to do and her various artistic endevours are &quot;mediocre&quot;.  She has tried photography (apparently not out of love for the medium, but rather to &quot;find herself&quot;), and still her photographer-husband cannot seem to connect with her.  What is HIS problem?! Anyway, because of all this, she sits day after day in her hotel room.  (BTW, did I mention she's in Tokyo?).  Eventually, she picks up with dull-man #2, Bob (played with even more hound-dog-face than usual by Bill Murray - STILL one of my heroes, despite this venture).  You see, Bob is a movie star who is going through a &quot;mid life crisis&quot; as Charlotte puts it.  Whatever THAT is, exactly, is never really displayed.  Anyway, Bob is being paid 2 million dollars for 2 days work on a whiskey commercial, but he remains sad, as he truly wishes he were &quot;Doin' a play somewhere&quot;.  Aside from this deep displayof love of theater (and strong argument for the revival of Communism), Bob is confused by all these funny people around him.  For one thing, they talk funny.  And what they are saying, nobody knows!  Well, these funny-faced people constantly get up in Bob's face and jibber-jabber all the time!!  Why won't they stop?!  They talk on and on, but the funny-faced translator says next to nothing....just like the bugs bunny cartoon on the Pacific island.  Regardless, these people are truly frustrating!!  Will someone please make them act normal!  What is it you call them again?  Anyway, Charlotte hooks up with Bob at the hotel bar after their glazed eyes meet, and they soon become the dullard-duo.  She teases him with insightful cliche's about his probably wanting to buy a Porshe.  He concurs he is lame.  Later, they sing bad karoke together, while the viewer's mind begins to wander about how nice it would be to drive a Porshe. Meanwhile, their encounters continue with the energy of terminally-ill cancer patient.  You see, Bob has a shallow life...I mean Wife.  We know she is shallow, because she is only concerned over picking the right carpet color.  This is illustrated in a long scene where Bob cannot seem to choose from carpet square samples over himself and the floor, as he further succumbs to a barely-breathing motif of wealth does not equal happiness.  Still not convinced of our hero's circumstance?  Well get an earful of his deathbed rendition of Roxy Music's &quot;More Than This&quot;, which he sings as if he has never heard (how cool to be uncool, eh?).  Anyway, Bob and his newfound glob seem to connect, despite their decades-separated mix of world-weary apathy and beautiful-but-misunderstood depression.  Unfortunately, all this must soon come to end.  You see...aside from some kids he's squeezed out, Bob must go back to pick out that carpet square in person.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention...Bob has 2 kids back home.  Anyway, our heroes eventually part without saying the appropriate soulful goodbyes, so Bob chases down our mallrat-with-undeserved-money-and-opportunity until he finds her...and soulfully....kisses her.  Then, he wanders off with the activity of a digestive tract, presumably only to be seen on various subway ads.  She smiles and cries.  The audience smiles and cries.  I cry.  Then we all try to get the DVD back to Hollywood video ASAP so we can get a buck back.  <br />Want to see a GOOD &quot;pointless&quot; movie about 2 people connecting in Japan?  Try the absolutely beautiful &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;.  All the arty-farty you'll ever need, but time well spent.  Plus, it ain't racist.  Want another good film?  Try &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; by Spike Jonze.  IT'S excellent!  AND it has a great performance by Cameron Diaz!
B000002UAC|5.0|First of all this album rocks. It has some good originals and a couple of good covers. <br />But what I am interested in is answering the questions of why this isn't Meet The Beatles. This is the version released in the UK. And some people may ask why the UK version and not the US? I would say because this is the version the band originally wanted. The US record label would ommit certain songs and add other ones and put them on another album to make more money. And The Beatles themselves even thought of it as butchering (hence the protest of the butcher cover of Yesterday and Today).<br />Don't get me wrong I would love to see the US versions released too. So the fans could have a choice and listen to the versions they are used to. But I myself prefer the Brit releases
0156027321|5.0|Since I have finished reading Life of Pi, I am ready to read it again. This is one of those books that should be shared, and I have the ability to share it with 19 bright minds. I intend to teach the book in my 9th grade Honors English class this semester. It will be an excellent review for the NC English I End of Course test and an interesting novel unit. The story helps teach why reading can be enjoyable. Teaching something other than water-down textbook material will be refreshing for both me and the students I teach.
B000002UA9|4.0|I heard it was going to be like some bad Nsync album, that it was teenie bopper. But it wasn't, it was just your average early 60's rock album. Cool beats and because it was early 60's simple lyrics. <BR>Who ever thinks this is too teenie bopper, is taking it out of it's time period. This kind of rock was still consisdered the Devil's music (absolutly unbelievable by today's standards). Who was more rebelious in 1963?, the harder rock bands like The Who and The Stones didn't show up for awhile longer. Sure teenagers liked The Beatles, but their parents hated them. Today teenie boppers are socially accepted by the parents. By todays standards this would be more like a metal band than a teenie bopper.
B00008F5SU|4.0|&quot;Warrior on the Egde of Time&quot;, originally issued in 1975, was Hawkwind's 5th studio album, coming on the heels of the equally excellent &quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot; in 1974 and the definitive live Hawkwind experience and album &quot;Space Rituals&quot; in 1973.<br />The songs on &quot;Warrior on the Edge of Time&quot; (12 tracks, 49 min.) fall in a couple of categories: the &quot;epic&quot; space-rock tunes (&quot;Assault &amp; Battery/Golden Void&quot; and &quot;Magnu&quot;), the instrumentals (&quot;Opa Loka&quot;, &quot;Spiral Galaxy&quot;, the spoken pieces (&quot;Wizzard Blew His Horn&quot;, &quot;Standing at the Edge&quot; and &quot;Warriors), and the straight-forward hard rockers (&quot;Dying Seas&quot; and &quot;Kings of Speed&quot;). Until those last tracks, the album plays as one long track, you can almost see and feel the story unfold in front of you. Think of it as a space rock version of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;!<br />This was Lemmy's last album with Hawkwind, and there is some irony in the fact that this CD comes with one bonus track, the B-side of &quot;Kings of Speed&quot;, which is none other than &quot;Motorhead&quot;, a Lemmy penned tune that will blow out your stereo! Hawkwind would go on to have a couple more really good studio albums (&quot;Astounding Sounds&quot; and &quot;Quark Strangeness and Charm&quot;) before dropping in quality. I'm surprised, frankly, how well Hawkwind's albums from the early and mid-70s have stood the test of time. &quot;Warrior on the Edge of Time&quot; is very enjoyable from start to finish, and highly recommended.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Nineteen Eighty-Eight was a huge year for Aussie rock. There was this album by Midnight Oil, INXS' Kick, and The Church's Starfish. I was already familiar with INXS but not Midnight Oil or The Church. After being intrigued by the smash hit \\"Beds are Burning\\" I had to try this album. I was blown away by its musical and lyrical power. Peter Garrett's accent is broad and he's in your face! I am in no way a left-winger, but I sang heartily along about aboriginal land rights, nuclear weapons proliferation and corrupt politicians. Hey, the concerns were very Aussie-centric!<BR>Midnight Oil never reached the heights of similar socially conscious bands like U2 and R.E.M., but they were consistent. They weren't about image as much as they were about getting their message across. And they were talented musicians to boot. All the songs here are well-crafted. Just as Garrett is drowning you in his thick-accented outrage, the wonderful choruses come in with their backing harmonies. \\"Beds\\" was overplayed on radio but I still like it. \\"Put Down that Weapon\\" is a great song that starts quiet then builds in intensity. \\"Warakurna\\" became my favorite song with its catchy hook and stark images of aboriginal ghettos. \\"The Dead Heart\\" was the other big single, also a powerful song. \\"Bullroarer\\" has a terrific lead-in. I still don't know what was making that sound!<BR>I loved being able to see the Oils live (for free!) at the Taste of Chicago in 2002. That was a treat. Peter Garrett was larger than life and a real crowd-pleaser. He did do a bit of eco-preaching in between the songs but thank goodness it didn't get too over the top. The Oils' quality of music made their politics palatable at least.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This was such a great film!  I think it's one of the top three films of 2003!  It was so historically accurate and entertaining!  I highly suggest it!
B00000J2SO|2.0|After three hard rock albums Blackmore thought it was time to get a bit more poppy in order to reach a larger audience (at this time he was very much into Abba). He changed the line-up, the sound and the songwriting and the result was an album that disappointed many a Rainbow fan. Graham Bonnet's a great singer, but you can't do an album without the help of the other musicians and they sure sound tired &amp; uninspired here. With this line-up Rainbow was still a strong live-act though; just listen to the live compilation album &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; if you can find it ! But Blackmore quickly realized that he had made a mistake and reformed the band with new singer Joe Lynn Turner and hot shot drummer Bobby Rondinelli. The album that would follow, &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot;, got the band back on the right track with a good compromise between commercial songwriting and interesting playing. But he epical Dio-era would never return again !
B0001ADB8C|5.0|This collection belongs with every George Harrison Fan young and old. The DVD is filled with interviews of George, many of his music videos and footage from both the movie Shanghi Surprise and some songs from the Live in Japan concert. What stands out in the concert footage is the absolute talent of George on slide guitar.  It seems after all this time George is receiving some of the recognition he so greatly deserves! I have this collection on records, what a difference on CD's.  The music sounds crisp and fresh.  George actually sounds as if he is enjoying himself.  Most of the CD's come with additional tracks, some are demos but still worth listening to.  The DVD includes a wonderful booklet that chronicles The origin of the Dark Horse label and is written by Olivia Harrison.  I am truly struck by the quality of this boxed set.  Get it as quickly as you can and savor it!  There is so much to love and enjoy.  As I listened to the George Harrison CD I cried.  It was so lovely, provoked many memories and was filled with many love songs by George.  We are fortunate to have this collection available, for it really shows the gift George gave to all of us.
B000084T18|1.0|Ok, so this guy has hot abs and sexy pecs. Thats it. His face, well honestly, looking at his face is downright scary. I KNOW he was shot 9 times and it's really cool he survived, but, they should really avoid putting his face on cd covers. Just show his torso. <br />I might even be able to overlook his face if I understood ONE word he said. The mumbling is REALLY annoying and gets old very fast. He's very monotone and he is not pleasant to listen to. I guess he writes decent lyrics, but who can make out the mumbo jumbo that comes out of his mouth? Anyway, some of the beats are cool (In Da Club would be great without words) but, I have to agree with other reveiwers who hate the self proclaimed \\"pimps\\". How lame. <br />Rap music has hit a new low, indeed. I beg of you, buy rap music from the 80's, when rap MEANT something, and avoid buying any \\"rap album\\" made after 1990. Thank you.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Why would anyone want to make such a sucky movie? I'm not even going to begin explaining why you should not watch/buy this movie. Please don't.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|One of the best films I have ever seen! Made me laugh all the way! I'm rooting for Sofia for best director Oscar! <br />There are two types of people, those who get this film and those who don't.
B00003CXRP|1.0|My god i am tired. Let me just close my eyes. Dam this film is still on. If you know any thing about films, do not see this film! I will say it is an interesting idea, but poo cakes are an interesting idea, but it does not work. The film is long, so very long of, well...nothing. I am able to watch most films, but I had to fastforward and get to the end, even watching the film at speed is boring. If you have trouble sleeping, get this!
B00018TI5E|5.0|I just recieved this cd as part of my birthday present from my hubby. Let me tell you it is the best present I have ever recieved. John is at his all time best. The music just takes you away to a special place. You don't have to be a RHCP fan to love this music. Actually you will find more mellow music than their usual funk but it is just so pure and you can tell that every word comes from his heart. His voice has improved so much. Each song is better than the next. There isn't one song that I pass on when I am listening to this cd. John is a musical genius by far and a true artist with amazing talent. A must buy for any type of music fan. absolutely fantastic.
B00000294R|5.0|Wow! This is what an hip hop album is all about. Fresh rhymes and tight productions. Big L will always be the greatest MC, his skills are unbelievable. Every track in this album is great. Present artists like 50 Cent and Fabulous need to pick up lifestylez ov da poor &amp; dangerous and go back to the hip hop lab and come up with better album. This LP defines what Hip Hop is. SKILLZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!  R.I.P Big L
B00005JMNA|4.0|17-year old Katey (Romola Garai) and her wealthy family have moved to Havana in 1958 and are living in a first-class hotel.  Katey accidentally causes a young Cuban waiter (Diego Luna) to lose his job; there is a mutual attraction, and they share a love of dancing.  They prepare for the big Latin dance contest, but Castro's revolution is about to change everything.<br /><br />Diego Luna, who was so charming in Y Tu Mama Tambien, gets five stars from me.  Here he is sweet and very likeable, a terrific dancer, and oozes teenage appeal.  Co-star Romola Garai is fine, too, and the Cuban music and dance scenes are appropriately steamy.  The script and the photography earn three stars, however.  The story tries to balance youthful flirtation with the serious theme of political revolution.  Two movies could have been made, but one seems unconnected and somewhat shallow.  The whole movie was filmed in very dim lighting, even in sunlight, giving it a B-movie look.<br /><br />But Havana Nights is a pleasant movie with an appealing star, and I recommend it to those who like Cuban music, dancing, and teen romance.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|The third film from Satoshi Kon (Millenium Actress, Perfect Blue) rachets the state-of-the-art of anime film-making up another notch. This movie is simply amazing. Every nauance and detail of the characters is astounding. Most live-action films do not contain this kind of depth of character and story. And of course, this being a Kon film, just when you think you know what's going on, he twists it on it's ear, and it becomes a very different film from what you were expecting!<br />Get it! Get it! Get it!
B00005Y1MT|5.0|There are so many words that could effectively describe the musical poetry of Marillion's Brave.  It's rather unfortunate that Marillion has been lumped into the prog-rock genre simply because their music consistently stumps classification (such as in the early 90's when various forms of modern music were lumped together and labled &quot;alternative&quot;).  <br />Marillion may have had obvious influences that have been recognizable in their early recordings, but with Brave, they have transcended the label and &quot;jumped ship&quot; so to speak with a daring foray into something completely unique, yet strangely familiar.  This is definitely one of the most darkest compositions Marillion has ever recorded (although they've hinted that Marbles will take that darkness even further), yet the bittersweet melancholy of a &quot;little girl lost&quot;, both in body and spirit seemingly elicits hope in a world that consistently acts out of desperation.  <br />Naysayers will agree to disagree, yet that is the very essence of their existence.  Take the stance of &quot;majority rule&quot; and find out for yourself what a treasure this album truly is.
0316666343|2.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend, who said it was good, but sad. How true! Though I did read the entire book, I did not feel uplifted at the end. I had to take breaks between reading the chapters because I found it to be such an incredibly bleak story, and so very sad. While it was a well written story with an excellent premise, I just felt it was too sad to give it more than two stars.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I watched \\"Lost in Translation\\" again last night. I am truly amazed that a young person could create such a detailed, mature, moving, and personal film; one that connects with such assurance. There is no waste, every frame contributes to the film and to the story told.<BR> <BR>What really struck me about this movie was that the main characters weren't connecting in an \\"in love\\" or even an \\"in lust\\" way, though there is a beautiful restrained sexual tension portrayed, but that they are connecting soul to soul.  The filmaker's brilliant choice in the ending underscores the intimate bond created between the characters. <br />In many ways \\"Lost in Translation\\" reminds me of Krzysztof Kieslowski's work, specifically \\"Red\\".  From me, this is the ultimate compliment.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I just experienced Seinfeld for one year now, because it was never popular in the country I'm originally from. But after I saw the first couple of episodes I loved it. I was a big Friends fan but i have to admit that Seinfeld is the King of sitcoms. It is hilarious and well-written in every single episode. Just give us the DVDs as soon as possible.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is fantastic...it has a song for every mood that you are in.  It's a feel-good CD with upbeat tempos and songs that will keep your feet tapping.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase and with all this crap out in music lately, it's a much needed addition to the music scene.
B00009Z576|4.0|I've always been a fan of the work of bands in transition, as they struggle for a new identity of sorts, a redefinition (for example, Genesis and Fleetwood Mac each have a few of those records). Drama is a quintessential transition album, and the additional tracks on this new release reveal just how much soul-searching Yes had to endure in 1979-80.<br />The 1979 Paris sessions (tracks 13-16) produced by Roy Thomas Baker (Queen, The Cars) feature Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman just before they split. &quot;Dancing Through The Light&quot; is an early version of &quot;Run Through The Light,&quot; and combined with the other tracks (especially &quot;Friend of a Friend&quot;) it sounds like Baker wanted to make Yes into some prog rock version of The Cars. Not terribly successful, but fun to listen to him try.<br />Tracks 9 and 10 feature only Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White rocking out with some riffs as a trio in 1980. Fans of Howe should enjoy deconstructing his guitar play.<br />Tracks 11 and 12 introduce Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes to Yes. &quot;Tempus Fugit (Tracking Session)&quot; has Horn fumbling through unfinished lyrics with &quot;doot-doot-doo&quot; scat singing and Downes playing only vocoder and a couple piano chords, while the rest are on target.<br />The singles (tracks 7, 8) are fascinating. &quot;Into The Lens,&quot; only 3:44, splices sections out of sequence: bridge as intro then straight into the second verse, editing the first 4 minutes out. All momentum and no breathing room. The &quot;Run Through The Light&quot; single also has more drive than the album version with the dominant pulsating piano and Howe's electric guitar mixed out completely (save for a couple key spots). Radio edits have always fascinated me, and were a key reason why I bought this.<br />And, of course, the album proper (tracks 1-6) sounds great. Rhino's Bill Inglot can always be depended on to come through with appropriate remastering.<br />In 1980-81, Drama was dispensable, but after 24 years Drama is now essential to completely understand the progress and continuing evolution of Yes, Asia, and all of Trevor Horn's recorded productions.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I wasn't a radiohead fan before this album came out. The only thing I really knew about Radiohead was the song gCreeph, and I found it annoying. However, from the first time I heard OK Computer, i was mesmerized. Theres so much talent behind the entire album. The music is unique, deep... it draws you in. When you really listen to it, itfs not gweirdh. The tracks make so much sense when played in its entirety. This is one of my favorite albums of all timec Ifd say w/in the top 3.
B00003CY0V|4.0|SWORDFISH has everything a good action film should have - explosions, beautiful women, high-tech gadgets, guns, fast cars, spies, and golf.  When compared with other Action films of late, SWORDFISH is almost perfect.  At no point do you doubt the action authenticity of this film.  Probably the only thing that doesn't lend to action legitimacy is the concept of a fairly clever story line with all the little twists and surprises of a classic.  Meanwhile, there is also a terrorist element to the film that is guaranteed to make you cringe when put into today's real world perspective.<br />The Basics:  the essential synopsis of SWORDFISH begins almost in reverse with a fantastic hostage scene.  Then it clicks back a bit to a computer genius fresh out of Leavenworth who will go straight back to the big house if he even touches a computer.  But, he can't resist the enticing messenger sent to drag him back into the techno world of computer thievery.  She's offering him money, a chance to be a hacker king again, and most importantly, his little girl.  Of course, he has to deal with a madman and his underground, spy network all the while playing a dirty, little cat and mouse game with the FBI, DEA, and all other manner of government what-not.  That's the basics. <br />The Stars:  John Travolta (PULP FICTION; STAYIN' ALIVE) does another fantastic job as a madman gone madder, Gabriel.  While his work may not be a virtual act of genius (i.e. Kevin Spacey), he does have all it takes to play a variety of roles over large spans of film time and maintain a certain something that keeps him watchable (i.e. Tommy Lee Jones).  Travolta has stood the test of time, and SWORDFISH is no different.  Even though he's certainly not the good guy, Travolta is smooth, crazy, ingenious, and @$$-kicking throughout the film.<br />Hugh Jackman (X-MEN; KATE AND LEOPOLD), you remember him as Wolverine from the X-MEN movie, is no joke himself.  He's the hacker.  Where his fingers were claws of adamantium steel in S-MEN, they are lithe and nimble in SWORDFISH.  Many of us had our doubts about Jackman playing one of the greatest superheroes of all time, but he did no wrong as Wolverine and he continues the winning streak here.  The first time he touches a keyboard in the movie, you know things are going to, er, heat up.<br />Halle Berry (X-MEN; JUNGLE FEVER; BULLWORTH) plays Ginger, Gabriel's temptress, and you're never sure of her motives.  She's certainly pleasing all over this flick.  Don Cheadle (TRAFFIC; BOOGIE NIGHTS; ROSEWOOD) continues his own brand of smoothness as Roberts, the leader of a computer crime task force.  Meanwhile, Vinnie Jones (SNATCH; LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS) is underused and underrated once again.  He plays Marco, one of Gabriel's henchmen, and they definitely don't give him enough play.  It was the same thing in GONE IN 60 SECONDS.  SWORDFISH is no different.  This guy is one of the most intimidating actors on the market.  Sure, he can scare the holy hiccups out of you with just a look, but when he gets to talking all his smooth, British jive, he makes you want to dribble down your legs.  He's scary in a delightful way.<br />This cast is brilliantly supported by a careening plot and stunning effects.  The underworld spy, anti-terrorist, if-the-American-people-knew-about-you, you'd-all-be-in-prison, organization led by Gabriel might send shudders up your spine, but at least you won't be bored with the storyline.  Meanwhile, you may not dig hostages being turned into giant human claymore mines, but in this flick, their explosions are accompanied by special effects that are sure to wow any audience.<br />The sounds, the styles, the technology involved, and the overall concept of this new Action-packed rental give it a flavor that may not be for everyone, but is certainly spicy.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I've known about Kanye since Beanie's joint (which was great, but slept on). When I got news that he was putting out an album, I had some doubts, but I decided that I would check it out. When I got it, I played it in the car and heard Bernie Mac's voice. Very useless Intro. However, I played the rest of the album, and was amazed. Here's what I thought:<br />1. Intro (Not Rated)   <br />2. We Don't Care (4/5) Great start to the album, which is a song for the kids. Kanye doesn't focus on guns like (50 Cent) or other emcees. <br />3. Graduation Day (not rated)- Sort of like a skit, but ends with a weird singing verse by someone who is not Kanye West.   <br />4. All Falls Down (5/5)- Great track with Syleena Johnson, taking a note out Lauren Hill's book. Nice lyrics and message. Syleena does her thing too.<br />5. I'll Fly Away (not rated)- Highly skippable piano laced track, which could pass for a gospel song or something. <br />6. Spaceship (5/5)- One of my favourites. Consequece produces a nice long verse and Kanye isn't too bad. Loved the hook, the production, everything.          <br />7. Jesus Walks (4.5/5)- Another great track that would have been better if it was longer, 'cuz of the great production and lyrics.<br />8. Never Let Me Down (5/5)-Jay-Z Shines!!!!         <br />9. Get Em High (4.5/5)-Nice beat, and two cool verses from Common and Kweli.           <br />10. Workout Plan (not rated)- Intro skit for the following song.        <br />11. The New Workout Plan (2/5)- Funny song, but very clubbish/commericialized, which is what Kanye is not good at. <BR>          <BR>12. Slow Jamz (5/5)- We've all heard this one. This track is pure genius. GENIUS. The production is crazy, with some classic samples, and a tight hook from Jamie Foxx. Twista's verse to open the second part of the song is amazing. <br />13. Breathe in Breathe Out (1.5/5)- Wasn't feelin it too much. Very alike to the mainstream bull you always hear.           <br />14. School Spirit Skit 1 (not rated)-Funny skit mocking college. <br />15. School Spirit (4/5)- Average song, but I don't play it much.           <br />16. School Spirit Skit 2 (not rated)- Funny skit mocking college part 2. <br />17. Lil Jimmy Skit (not rated)- Funny skit mocking college part 3.          <br />18. Two Words (4.5/5)-Pretty good track with Mos Def and Freeway. The Harlem Boys Choir is also on here, making for a pretty good song.          <br />19. Through the Wire (5/5)- Amazing song, great beat (sample from &quot;Through the Fire [Chaka Khan])&quot;, and heartfelt lyrics by an injured Kanye. <br />20. Family Business (5/5)-Another soft song about the family, making references to Grandma. Ice ain't everything!<BR>        <BR>21. Last Call (5/5)- Long song, ending the College Dropout greatly. After two above average verses from Kanye, the next 8 minutes are spent talking about the long process Kanye had to go through, from being evicted with his mom from the house, to getting picked up by Jay-Z and the ROC. <br />In closing, this album is a must-buy, and a breath of fresh air for Hip-hop today.<br />Recommended: Yes<br />Good to Listen to When: Anytime, especially driving.
B00003CXS4|5.0|SNATCH, the latest film from Guy Ritchie's catalogue, continues the rollicking line of English gangster cinema spawned by the writer/director.  Once again, Ritchie manages to tie up all the loose ends of a variety of capers into one, big, package of corruption set in London and centered on one fist-sized stolen diamond.  Pulling from the same crowd of actors in his last hit Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, the director almost creates a sequel.  The film is full of talent, from the writing to the acting to the fantastic dialogue and on down even to the music.<br />     SNATCH stars some of today's biggest actors such as Benicio DelToro (TRAFFIC; THE USUAL SUSPECTS) and Brad Pitt (LEGENDS OF THE FALL; SE7EN; FIGHT CLUB) as tiny, yet extremely important characters.  Rarely do you find such talent filling in supporting roles in foreign films.  But, both DelToro and Pitt portray their characters beautifully.<br />     Pitt plays Mickey, a fast-talking, tattoo-sporting, gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion who refuses to go down in a series of illegal boxing matches.  DelToro stars as a Frankie Four Fingers, a Jewish gangster with some what of a gambling problem - he has debts he can't pay, so they give him the chop, hence the name.  Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is another actor hailing from our hemisphere.  Farina plays Frankie's cousin who hates England and hates the fact that he has to fly over there and get Frankie out of trouble.<br />     But, though the semi-American supporting actors do give the movie that good bit of USA flavor, it is the English cast that really makes the flick.  Turkish (Jason Statham) is a simple boxing promoter who is trying his hardest to avoid the crime lord of the illegal boxing world, Brick Top (Alan Ford).  Brick Top is known for feeding those he doesn't like to the pigs.  Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia) is trying to steal Frankie's diamond, but Frankie is off gambling on unlicensed boxing.  Meanwhile, Cousin Avi hires Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones - GONE IN 60 SECONDS) to locate Frankie.  Well before long, the entire state of affairs is so tangled up Ritchie himself could only put it right by killing off half the people involved, shoving the diamond down the mouth of a stray dog, and burning a few trailers.  Don't understand what I could possibly be talking about?  Rent this movie, and you'll get the picture.<br />     The only foreseeable problem I can envision with this flick is that you'll probably have to watch it a couple of times before you finally get the real jist of it.  Like Lock, Stock... it is impossible to take it all in on the first run-through.  So, I recommend you grab a beverage and a companion of your choice (be it man, woman, or beast), slip this cinematic masterpiece into your DVD/VCR, prop your feet up on the coffee table, and get ready to feel the adrenaline as this super-charged crime caper gets your heart going and reminds us insane Americans of our fanatical UK roots.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Its a well documented fact that the beatles have sold over 1 billion records worldwide- these 27 songs on &quot;1&quot; are a pretty good example why!
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is one of those albums that a teenager must have. A collection of well produced catchy songs. Blink 182 shines on Enema Of The State and in my opinion is their best CD.
0790729628|2.0|I don't like the Director's Cut.  Anyone know if I can get the REAL movie? helen@ewm.com  The narration MADE the movie!
B00005JM4Z|1.0|This movie has set a new degree of boredom for me. Why is it that this year seems to have had a bunch of really bad films. All I can say is that I didn't like this movie at all.
B000089CJI|4.0|The fourth song, &quot;Nothing Better&quot; sounds so much like the Pet Shop Boys that it's almost eerie. Also, the liner notes contain the full lyrics, which are really quite intelligent. All around a great release, not sure how well it will stand the test of time, but for now it's on high rotation.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|This is a great movie i reccomend everyone to see it. Especiall when the eloi are the little rich ones is what the time traveler thinks. But the morlocks are the scary ones watch out for them they will eat the eloi and the weena jumps in the fire because she doesnt know what it is...man she is a dork,they have no tecknology because what is tecknology with out fire.
B0001AP12G|5.0|before I bought this album i was sceptical. I am a fan of producers like timbaland and The Neptunes, producers who dont rely on samples to craft their beats. Kanye west does use samples, but when i heard the album I realise that he does it in a way unlike anyone before him. He crafts these pieces of music, with such soul and depth, the like of which I have never heard before. His lyrics are funny and relevant, not at all cheesey or rap cliche. He says things that most rappers would not say, for fear of damaging their credibilty. 'Jesus Walks' is a song about the battles he faces every day and how God's strength gets him through. 'All falls down' is about using jewellery and cars to make him feel on a par with the rest of the world, because he feels like a second class citizen.<BR>This is easily one of the greatest debut albums, in any genre, of all time. Like Nas' Illmatic and Snoop Doggs Doggystyle were seminal works,  so this will go down  as Kanye Wests little piece of history. Dont miss it.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I really found this movie to be pretty bad!! I mean I watched this movie and felt no empathy for the characters. Bob was some rich lonely loser and the female role was nothing but a crybaby who was jealous of her husbands fame. I think she should have stayed home while he was in Japan if she was going to whine so much. I have truly seen the bottom of the barrel on this movie. The only saving grace this movie had was the beautiful scenery and a few really cool scenes into the true Japan.
B0000C1733|5.0|this album is awesome. i don't think there is one thing bad about it. though they still could have added can't stop which is one of their best songs out there. they've come along way in their music and that definitely shows in their Greatist Hits. i would recommend this album along with blood sugar sex magik which has a definite chili pepper feel to it.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Sweeping, moving, complex, cathartic, moody, beautiful, subtle and triumphant are also great descriptors.  I would even go as far to say that this soundtrack seems like a mix of Howard Shore's the Lord of the Rings, Hans Zimmer's Gladiator and even James Newton Howard's Unbreakable.  Drawing influence from the musical landscape of middle eastern culture, Debney accentuates his classical score with the soothing and sometimes intense rhythm of tribal drums and a beautiful array of serenading and haunting choral chants.  Raw.  Beautiful.  Moody.  Powerful. I mean...this is one heck of a soundtrack.  And you know a soundtrack is good when you look forward to listening to it while you drive, swim, eat, read and/or sleep (among other relaxing activities)!   Well...that's my criteria. :)  <br />In my opinion, here's the bottom line:  <BR>For fans of interculturally influenced orchestrations - This is a MUST buy.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|In a dark, not-so-far-off-nor-far-fetched time, Detroit is a violent wonderland of criminal activity. Murphy (Peter Weller) and Lewis (Nancy Allen) are partners in a police force under siege. While sneaking into the hideout of some particularly bloodthirsty and disgusting badguys, led by the reprehensible Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), Murphy is captured, tortured, shot full of holes, and left for dead. This scene is rather disturbing to watch (much like Verhoeven's brain-sucking scene in \\"Starship Troopers\\"). Murphy survives, only to become the latest experiment in crime prevention under the control of a mega-corporation called OCP (Omni Consumer Products). He becomes ROBOCOP. His body destroyed, he now has a mechanical one, and is a walking weapon of mass destruction! He sets out to clean up the streets and uphold justice. Unfortunately, the scientists forgot that he was human, and robocop is haunted by memories of his wife and son. He also remembers those who mutilated him. This sets up one of the best revenge films I've ever seen. ROBOCOP uncovers the sinister secrets of OCP's #2 man (Ronny Cox) and must do battle with the ED-209, an earlier robotic crimefighter design with heavy-duty guns and missiles. This battle is ferocious! ROBOCOP is a gruesome tale. However, it also has lots of humor to offset the grim storyline. Verhoeven's portrayal of the media as a blood-circus and vacuous wasteland is pretty accurate, even though he was doing a parody of it. I highly recommend ROBOCOP to all sci-fi / action / black humor fans out there...
0671027344|5.0|High school drama.  Too many novels, articles, poems, and songs have been penned on the teenage years, yet this Chbosky does so magnificently.  A novel that focuses on poetically created characters rather than a spiderweb-thin plotline, Wallfloweris the rare kind of novel that changes lives.  I realize how cliche that sounds, but I can't think of any other way to describe it.  Written as a composite of letters, Wallflower is painful, comical, straightforward, subtle, but most of all, it's real.  I can't stress enough what a fantastic novel this is.  Whehter you're just entering high school or attending your fifty-year reunion, this novel needs to be read.  I felt especially impacted, since the characters that surround the protagonist, Charlie, could have been lifted from the pages of my freshman year photo album.  The characters that <BR>Chbosky creates are multi-faceted yet plausible.  OK, I'm done.  There's not much more I can say besides... read this book!
B000096FUD|5.0|Poor Terry Gilliam. He spends time, money, energy, and I'm sure eaten a lot of antacids, and it comes to naught. But I guess the worse part is not being able to fulfill his dream. For the uber-creative director of many marvelous films, including personal fave &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot;, you'd think he'd be able to whip up a nice little Don Quixote film. But without Hollywood's resources, the money, punctuality from the actors, and cooperation from the weather his film, and his dream, came crashing down. It's unfortunate, because it looked really, really good.<br />Unlike the glossy &quot;making of&quot; features on many films that are standard DVD extras these days, this documentary goes underneath the smiles and compliments and &quot;best time of my life&quot; statements and makes you wonder how films even get made. Although Gilliam's &quot;Quixote&quot; had more than it's fair share of problems to deal with, this documentary shows very well the perpetual purgatory of panic that can befall a production.<br />From the very beginning we see Gilliam struggling with props and sets, and his exhausted and frustrated crew wondering what exactly he wants while struggling to find resources that aren't as abundant in Spain as they are in London or Hollywood. We see Gilliam's right hand man, 1st Assistant Director Phil Patterson, and various producers trying to reel in actors, Johnny Depp, Vanessa Paradis, and Jean Rochefort, from all over Europe on schedule (while making the said schedule). Once shooting, a hail storm from nowhere strikes, fighter planes do test runs over the set, a studio is actually a warehouse with horrendous sound, Rochefort comes down with a prostate problem, and calamity after calamity hits the weary production. It's painful, and by the time Patterson informs Gilliam that his film is basically dead, it's the emotional, inevitable climax of a very taut and stress-packed narrative. It never was going to happen from the beginning, and we see almost everyminute of it. The filmmakers of this film don't interfere with what's going on, and most of the input we get is a more honorable (and very visual) form of eavesdropping, with the exception of a few knowing glances here and there and short explanations from producers, Gilliam, and crew members. And Johnny Depp shows up totally at ease and laid back (with sympathetic worried glances and tension breaking wisecracks when needed), to the delight of this Depp fan.<br />I think this is one of the best films about the making of a film, a subject we really don't get to hear much about although it's remarkably fascinating. It's up there with DVD commentaries and the similarly apocalyptic &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; series in it's dive into the real machinery of a film.  Where &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; gave us an idea of what a line producers do,  behind the scenes relationships, and budgetary fidgeting, this gives you a good idea the enormity of the movie set and everything that could possibly go wrong. According to these, it's more akin to managing a company or running an army and trying to win every battle than creating the vision of a renegade artist.<br />In the end, Gilliam is Quixote, an irony not lost on the filmmakers, Gilliam, or viewers. And the project? It's that blasted windmill.
B000005J56|5.0|Buena Vista Social Club's self titled first album is musical excellence. Focusing predominantly on son, a traditional Cuban musical form, BVSC delivers, and with spectacular results. This collaborative masterpiece between BVSC and Ry Cooder simply must be experienced. From the first chords on the tres on &quot;Chan Chan&quot; to the final notes of &quot;La Bayamesa&quot;, BVSC takes the listener on a trip to both Old Havana as well as rural Cuba. BVSC provides  an excellent introduction to traditional Cuban music to those who are new to the genre, as well as a more than satisfying offering to even the most discerning Cuban music afficionado. In all honesty, I feel (and I think that most of this album's reviewers would tend to agree with me on this one) that to discredit this album is truly to demonstrate profound ignorance and lack of appreciation for son music, one of Cuba's oldest and most respected musical styles. In short, this album is ablsoutely essential listening and a must-buy, hands down. If you don't already own this album, buy it as soon as possible. You won't be disappointed.
B0000399WI|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time, it's one of those movie's that can infulence a change in your life. This movie has some great lessons like: Don't do anything half-assed/ If your gonna do something give it a 110%, Don't do anything you might regret, hope is something you can hold onto and there is much much more. If I were you I would definately buy this movie because it is so good. <br />When Andy (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison for falsely accused of killing his wife that was cheating on him he gains a strong relationship between him and a prison buddy named Red (Morgan Freeman). None of Andy's friends in Shawshank believe that Andy actually killed his wife, through thick and thin Andy and Red experiance events in a prison run by a crooked warden. <br />PARENTAL WARNING: Extremely Strong and Graphic Language and Mild Graphic Violence, and a scene of sexuality (I think)<BR>SUGGESTED AGE: Definately 13-14
B00009V7P8|5.0|Let me just say that it takes a lot for a cd to come along and really just make me sit up and listen, and listen, and keep listening. Damien Rice's &quot;O&quot; is one of those rarities that keeps me having faith in the music industry today. Soft and yet powerful strings, mixed with the melodic blend of Damien and other musician's voices, topped with astonishing lyrics create a combination that will leave the listener speechless, which is what a good album should do. This isn't just a cd, its an artistic masterpiece that should be in everyone's collection.
0385507755|5.0|You've got to catch your breath at some points when you read \\"A MILLION LITTLE PIECES.\\" It's a fairly intense book. That's a good thing. It's intense because it is honest and I like that. If you want to read a book about addiction, why get a Politically Correct, overly-sanitized Disney Channel story? \\"A MILLION LITTLE PIECES\\" is the real thing, in the same category of intensity as \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE,\\" \\"RUNNING WITH SCISSORS,\\" and \\"NAKED LUNCH.\\"
2070518426|5.0|(Pardonnez l'orthographe et les accents manquant)<br />Ce livre est super pour nous faire rencontrer Harry Potter.  Comme adulte, je le trouve tres facile a lire, mais comme parent j'apprecie que mes enfants se trouvent resolue a ecoute l'histoire au complet!  On en a lu deux chapitre le jour, et ca seulement a cause que ma voix manquait si j'en lisais plus!<br />Bien ecrit, avec un complot mouvementez, J. K.

Elle nous intrigue avec ses descriptions et nous nous retrouvons a en vouloir savoir de plus en plus.<br />Personellement, j'ai lu se livre en une journee, et puis les trois livres suivant en moins d'une semaine!  Je ne peux attendre a me retrouve avec le tome 5 de Harry Potter.<br />Je le conseille fortement aux enfants et aux parents.
B00004STPT|5.0|I saw the movie, Gladiator a few years ago in theaters with my dad. Although I loved the movie and thought it was amazing, nothing &quot;stuck with me&quot; more than the haunting and completely melodic music.<BR>The score opens with &quot;Progeny&quot;, the same song that opens the movie for those of you who have seen it. I call it a mysterious ballad, lonely in the beginning with Commodus' theme, and then a pretty Spanish guitar towards the end. Immediately after is &quot;The Wheat&quot;, a short, desert-like Arabian tune with a single woman humming a melody. The end grows into &quot;The Battle&quot;, a 10-minute masterpiece that made the movie in my opinion. Wonderful harmonic instruments and percussion begin the song, and within a minute they disappear leaving the drums and the Spanish guitar. A man vocalizes for a moment, and the guitar returns, strumming a sort of insane little riff than eventually turns into the battle cry of the Roman soldiers. Trumpets blare, drums blast, cymbals crash, stringed instruments begin to tone down the entire song. A little echo-y thing occurs with the trumpets and horns, then this explodes into more percussion and the undeniable theme of Gladiator. The tempos and time signature changes and the song ends miraculously and intensely.<BR>&quot;Earth&quot; seems to be the prettiest song, heard literally from the beginning of the movie to the end. It doesn't contain many instruments, but the solos are so pretty. First, I'm assuming a woodwind plays it, followed by the most beautiful trumpet solo I've heard in awhile. It never ceases to make me hum along.<BR>&quot;Sorrow&quot; is the song played when Maximus finds his wife and son dead (sorry if you haven't seen the movie and I ruined it, but it happens early on so it's not like a surprise). It focuses mainly on the miserable choral of a single woman. Then it slides into &quot;To Zucchabar&quot;, a flowing piece with a compelling bass and a fluid melody.<BR>&quot;Patricide&quot; is thehelpless, depressing harmony that occurs during the &quot;death&quot; of Marcus Aurelis. Following is the short &quot;The Emperor is Dead&quot;, with the melody being played on what I believe is an instrument called a 'Yan Chin'.<BR>&quot;The Might of Rome&quot; is the most obvious of all the songs with it's clearly 'Roman' style. It is played during a gladiator battle scene, very tribal and brutal, straying far from the flourish of the other songs and being stripped of all splendor. It starts slow and drum-driven, then increases tempo to a climactic ending.<BR>&quot;Strength and Honor&quot; is a melancholic yet triumphant panoply.<BR>Both &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Slaves to Rome&quot; strike me as really being two parts to the same song because of how smoothly they flow into each other, but &quot;Slaves...&quot; is way more dramatic and a very, for lack of a better term, bitterly jubilant ode, later drowning to the quiet Commodus theme.<BR>&quot;Barbarian Horde&quot; is another take on &quot;The Battle&quot;, only this time in the Colisseum and as gladiators before the valor of Rome, so I need not describe it further.<BR>&quot;Am I Not Merciful?&quot; is my third favorite. It's very dark, very gloomy. This is played at one of the most sad scenes in the movie, during which Commodus threatens his own sister and her son (his own nephew, the heir to the throne) and yells at her when she has truly done nothing wrong. It's slow, yes, but very powerful.<BR>&quot;Elysium&quot; features a woman singing as she did in the beginning of the movie, but more hopeful and bright. This song changes paces into &quot;Honor Him&quot;, the conclusion of Gladiator and return of the recurring theme to &quot;Earth&quot;, but more jubilant and strong.<BR>Then the last song, &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;, a more modern-day sounding piece with full vocals and instrumentation to complete the saga of Gladiator.
0385512104|5.0|As I read this book,I had to keep reminding myself that a non-autistic person wrote it:that's how eerily accurate it is written. The story concerns Christopher, a teenage boy in England who is (a la \\"Rainman\\") a Math Savant,yet,like many Autistics,cannot stand to be hugged,has trouble recognizing other's peoples(or his own) emotions,and adheres to a strict routine to cope with a world that is not as precise as the math problems he loves solving. The mystery he tries to solve(and due to his strong sense of logic,does) is just a jumping-off point to a story full of imagination and gentle humor. I think this book does a great service for Autistics as well,it shows that they are people with feelings and personal issues too. An original,thoughtful book.
B00006AW2O|5.0|Well, that sounds good to say, I am not adamanant about this, however, there is a great quaintness to early Rolling Stones: <br />Even this, being pre-Satisfaction, pre-Off of my Cloud Stones: the more blues oriented band, the band started by Brian Jones; Muddy Waters/Lightin Hopkins Chi-Town Blues based sound; and Chuck too.<br />Around and Around, great version, Stones do it the Animals did; Love you live has a great version, Chuck Berry knew R N R. \\"When the police came those doors flew back, but they kept on a-Rockin' goin' round and round\\", this song, Stones did on TV, maybe Ed Sullivan or Shindig, even.<br />Confessin the Blues, ain't no one better, than Mick at such covers,<br />Empty heart; oh yes, the boys start to write their own songs, no pussy footing here; great guitar work, classic Stones, the much dissed release, Metamorphosis, has that \\"Don't you lie to me\\", with those excellent rocking guitars, I find similar.<br />Time is on my side, great, this is the organ based version as opposed to the subsequent hit single soon after, with the opening well-known blues chords, slightly different version. (I hope I have this straight, on re-edit).<br />Good Times Bad Times, on High Tide and Green Grass as a hit, another one of the Stones songs, like Play with fire one may not know of that well; nice harmonica, bluesy feel, smooth as silk. Maybe here, is where they started using slide guitar, or if not would have benefitted from it; but doesn't need anything more to begin with.<br />It's all over now, this song, Not fade away, as well, as other bands contributions like Them's Gloria did much for the later Rock;<br />2120 South Michigan, Hey, is this street in Chicago? It's a gem. This is where the boys roots are from, musically that is, this is an instrumental, kind of neat, like the early Beatles instrumentals you can find, what is it called, \\"Shadow\\" or similar. <br />They were in Chicago, Chess Studios, even saw their idols, involved moving gear around; they did not suspect.<br />Congratulations; well, its a good song, and probably real good for '65; has Stones trademark now sound, songwriting beginning to evolve; Bluesy too. \\"Remember the first time you tried to do it to me, my love won't stop just wait and see.. congradulations, you broke another heart, you've torn it apart.\\" Sounds like our guys way back then, huh?<br />If you need me, Otis Redding right? Mick again, is way on top of things on this one, excellent.<br />Susie-Q; even I knew Creedence's version over this, but the boys do allright again; a partner to Walkin' the Dog on another wax release.
B00005JKC3|3.0|Outside of some drawbacks, the Hulk is good and worth seeing multiple times, if at all for the surprising and multiple psychological layers. However if you are looking for major action instead of visceral drama, look elsewhere. <BR>I've seen a lot of movies where it looks like the studio and director influences are fighting with each other and the studio ultimatley wins out therby hindering the project. In this case it's the opposite. This is what happens when a director understands aesthetically what the comic is about, but not the general appeal. The Hulk is a very thoughtful and introspective film, but there are times here when thinking outside the box is the major flaw. Ang Lee got the look and the mood of the film down, but I cannot agree enough with another amazon reveiwer who said that the fun was missing from the film. Which is what this needed and what the studio was trying to do.<br />The DVD makes every attempt to compensate for the movies shortcomings. The Bonus features are great. I loved the origin of the Hulk and and the obligitory Stan Lee interview that comes with all Marvel comic adaptations explaining how the character came to be. The in depth featurettes with the CG dogs and the films unique editing process I also enjoyed. Ang lee's commentary is the only feature left to be desired. If he says anything at all, it's mostly esoteric. Example, I swear I'm not lying:(in montone) \\"He reminds me of Picasso painting watermelon clowns in pink.\\"  ............ookay! You go Ang!<br />Back to the film, the CG worked, especially in a great tank battle set in the desert. This was true vintage Hulk and it did not disappoint. <BR>Both Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott are in their element and command the screen very time they show up. The chemistry actually is better with Elliot/Conelly then with Connely/Bana and I wound up caring more about the resolution betweeen the father and daughter. It was pleasant surprise that really worked.<BR>And kudos to Danny Elfman for not making a \\"Danny Elfman\\" score. If you would have played me the music with out telling me I never would have guessed. There is some arabic chanting that lends itself unexpectedly well.<br />The editing and transitions were ingenious and well thought out. Where it really stood out was when the Hulk escapes an underground compound. It kept the action going and you could absorb alot at one time. However there were times of sheer grandstanding. An overly long chopper sequence flying in the desert being the prime offender.<br />Another flaw in that stood out was establishing characterization. Which some have blamed on Bana's performance but I desagree. We needed to see a solid example of Bruce Banner's passiveness beforehand thereby making an actual need, cinematically, for the inevitable tranformation. <BR>When the first Hulk-Out occurs in the lab, it was, comparitavely, anti-climatic. Banner is alone and it just sort of ... well, happens. In the commentary Ang Lee states that Banner first tranformation was brought on by fear and anxiety. Interesting choice, but it should have been switched with the second Hulk-Out. In that one, the stakes were raised (Betty in Danger, Bruce being provoked)and there was a need for Hulk. I got goose bumps the second time the Hulk appears and was very much aware that I did not the first time, which after forty minutes of exposition, should have happened.<br />Flaws aside, this is a decent watchable film. But it's something you really have to be in the mood for. However lacking in charm and fun, there is a lot of cerebral themes to gnaw on. But it might too much for those looking for a staightforward adaptation of a beloved character.
B0001AP12G|4.0|whenever albums are hyped i'm always suspicious, i've been disappointed too many times....but this album didn't even come close to disappointing...beats are great (no surprise there),but kanye's rhymes....who said this guy wouldn't be able to rap??!?...his rhymes are deep and funny...&quot;man i promise, i'm so self conscious, that's why you always see me with atleast one of my watches...rollies and pashas done drove me crazy, i can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versasy {versace}&quot;....&quot;we wasn't supposed to make it past 25, jokes on you we still alive&quot;..tracks like all falls down, we don't dare, family bussiness, two words....are my favourites.....other points....<BR>-too many skits(but i can live with that)<BR>-never knew how much he really HATES college (listen to the skits)<BR>-workout plan has a good club beat...nobody will pay attention to the lyrics<BR>-my pick for next big single of this album.....either all falls down, we don't dare, family business(what a great song), or two words, man, this whole album should be on the radio...as for clubs, i'd say....workout plan<BR>-album has such a unique and different sound<BR>-last bonus track's got some good stories--don't skip this track<BR>-amazing album kanye! who's doubting him now?
B000002UTI|5.0|This album has been available on CD since it's original release in 1988. It's funny reading the reviews here because they appear to be very recent and apparently written by people who've never seen the &quot;Imagine: John Lennon&quot; film or heard &quot;Real Love&quot; before the Beatles reformed &amp; did it for their Anthology series. Why include this acoustic version you may ask instead of the &quot;other demo&quot;? Well watch the opening of the film and you'll hear this simple and beautiful performance as we &quot;skim the tree tops of Ascot&quot;, England. This is the soundtrack to that film...it's not designed to be yet another Beatles/Lennon compilation but instead includes some rather amazing &amp; influential musical  highlights from the film.  <BR>The selection of Lennon's Beatles work is quite illuminating. With &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; as the only nod to the &quot;Beatlemania&quot; years, the rest of these tracks  stem (mostly) from their post '65 period. John's lyrics had evolved and  become personal &amp; /or autobiographical (Help!/In My Life/Julia/Ballad Of John &amp; Yoko/Don't Let Me Down), creative  (Strawberry Field Forever/A Day In The Life) &amp;  socially conscious (Revolution).  <BR>This links very well to John's solo work which seems to concentrate on his early 1970/71 &quot;Plastic Ono Band/Imagine&quot; period &amp; his later &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; stuff but has very little in between. In fact their isn't a more stark or dramatic contrast that between John's &quot;God&quot; where he excorsises his personal demons while disowning what was once important  to him (Elvis, Beatles, Dylan..),  and his  simple but hopefully  optimistic &quot;Imagine&quot;, a song that has stood as an &quot;ode for world peace&quot; for the last 30+ years.   The inclusion of the rehearsal version of &quot;Imagine&quot; is very interesting as a pointer to the finished work. &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, from his &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; LP  is the solitaryrepresentation of his &quot;Peace Activism&quot; &amp; Lost Weekend&quot; stages thus &quot;Sometime In New York City&quot;, &quot;Mind Games&quot; &amp; &quot;Wall &amp; Bridges&quot; LP's are not represented at all. The &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; period features &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)&quot; &amp; &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot;.  <BR>At the time there may have also been a conscious effort to keep this album down to a single CD (I think it was originally a Double vinyl LP - I might be wrong). However whatever the reason, this album  is quite an enjoyable experience and highly recommended, even as an abridged intro to both The Beatles &amp; John Lennon. At the same time it could also be the soundtrack to many of our lives..it is for mine.
B000070IXT|5.0|First off I will say I don't play the video game. I'm sure a lot of the game's fans are angry because the movie doesn't follow the game to a tee. It's a movie based on the game, people, not a documentary of the game, so give the cast and the director some freedom. They did a great job here. I enjoyed \\"Resident Evil\\" a lot! I was most impressed with Milla Jovovich's character, she looks so fragile and beautiful, but she can defend herself easily and shows no fear, mentally very strong. The story line was very interesting and kept me guessing. The style was creepy & gory and also fast paced. Great casting! All the characters fit well and the actors did a great job with this movie. The visual/special effects was awesome!! I can't see any flaws at all. I just wish this movie went on longer, but the sequel \\"Resident Evil:Apocalypse\\" opens in October! I can't wait. Glad they didn't make this one a kiddie PG-13 flick. This DVD is also available as a superbit!!!
B00005QW5X|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie/play. I have seen the play 3 times and own the DVD and VHS. I listen to the CD all day everyday at work. The music cannot be better...so moving. While the film/play is a mix of dark comedy, hilarious scenes and what some people might find downright outrageous, I am more inclined to call this a kind of Greek Tragedy, Hedwig being the protagonist...her fatal flaw (a botched sex change among other things) is both her downfall (miserable life) and her triumph. I won;t say more. Excelt, do yourself a huge favor ans see both the film and the play.
B0000029GA|3.0|I have some respect for this rapper because he has a very distinct rap style and his music has some substance to it.He doesnt just rap about being ghetto or how wealthy he is but raps about empowering his people and real life issues.The music in this album was pretty good and I would recommend this album because I dont really like rap but I enjoyed this one.
B000002IPZ|5.0|I wrote an earlier review where I gave this CD two stars. I owe an appology to the band and the shoppers for that. What this CD really suffers from is production. I didn't start to appreciate it until I got a new and better stereo. It's too damn quiet for me, as are all of Testament's earlier albums. They don't do the band justice. But the guitar playing kicks ass. Alex Skolnick was the best lead in thrash metal, and this is the last album I know where he'd show it. The bass and drums are origional Testament's usual quality, and Chuck Billy does a great job on vox as always. Buy this album, especially at $12, its worth it almost just for Skolnick's jaw dropping solo on &quot;Face in the Sky&quot;. Just try and find a good stereo to play it on.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The Beach Boys' music is not great art, but it is undeniable that Brian Wilson is among this century's most talented pop songwriters. Unlike many others, his gifts seemed purely natural; he worked hard in the recording studio, but that was not because he could not come up with good music, but because he had trouble translating it into the realm of the actual. Unfortunately, Wilson's drug addictions and schizophrenia shut him down at the relatively younge age of twenty-five, and the world has seen only a few flashes of brilliance from him since.<br />Pet Sounds is Brian Wilson's finest achievement and should be appreciated by all who value good music. My favourite here is the transcendent &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; one of the few pop songs to celebrate marriage.
B000003TA4|5.0|If you have heard this album, then you have witnessed one of the biggest pieces of rock history that exists. This album is polished, not my favourite Nirvana album, but the best in a different way. The songs on this album influenced so many of the modern bands around today, and it is so easy to understand why. It goes from the anger and adolescence expressed through \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", to the darkness and melancholy of \\"Something in The Way\\". If this album didn't exist then neither would the sound of modern rock. No CD collection is complete without it, becuase every rock CD released after it, was centered around Nevermind. I will agree, this isn't the true core of Nirvana, but that doesnt make it a bad album, it just makes it different to their others. So stop giving it bad reviews becuase it isnt \\"true Nirvana\\", you're not rating it on that, your rating it on how good it is.
B000000P17|4.0|Sure, it pales in comparison to the rest of GNR's mighty albums.  And sure, it's sad to know that the last of the original GNR albums couldn't be one of original material.  But this album isn't completely irrelevant - it can still pack a punch.<br />This album is usually looked down upon by the masses. This is basically because it is an album of covers, and at that, the usually quality-filled Gunners chose a largely disappointing selection of songs to cover.  It's great to proclaim your origins, but the covers on the Illusions albums (mostly new songs there) blow these away.  But here's a fine point that I'd like to point out, which is actually the motivating force behind what I believe is the proper analysis of this; it isn't necessarily the covers themselves (though that is a part of it), it's how they use them! &quot;Knockin'....&quot; is as simple as songs can be.  But Guns epicified it.  They made it grand and royal and wonderful.  So, while this album clearly IS somewhat affected by the &quot;heavy-on-the-punk&quot; flavor, it could have been MUCH better if they had rearranged some of the also-simple tunes like &quot;Attitude&quot; and &quot;New Rose,&quot; which, well, except for the attitude of the songs, they don't do much.  THAT is why this album isn't too far above average.<br />Still, it IS Guns, and it IS above average.  The energy that drives that original lineup (also counting Matt and Dizzy) is definitely there (if changed), the production is not tooooooo raw (that would have killed it), and there are SOME awesome songs.  &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot; was a great idea but proved to be inconsistent when the rest of the album doesn't prove to follow through on the diversity.  Slash's signature licks are all over the album, which always helps it feel like home.  &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; is awesome, they really nailed the rhythmic aspects, and actually, I've now gotten into Nazareth because of this.  So, this album definitely can affect you somehow.  &quot;Ain't It Fun&quot; is another highlight, an all-around quality production that could almost convince you that it's Guns's own song.  &quot;I don't Care About You&quot; is appropriate and great (Guns is always good for anger management), and fine just the way it is, but there shouldn't have been so many other songs that are so similar.  Not that everything needs to be &quot;epic-ified,&quot; but again, it is quite a lopsided and inconsistent track-listing, if still powerful.<br />Covering Nazareth is brilliant, Covering Johnny Thunders is fine either way, covering Charles Manson (the &quot;hidden&quot; track at the end) is left to personal opinion, and covering Soundgarden is just wrong...<br />So, there's pros and cons, and more likely than not, everyone will have a slightly different take on it.  It's largely left to personal opinion, largely due to how the punk tunes work for you.  Still, it's not bad.  It's not a &quot;first tier, grade A&quot; album, but I rank it as holding its own, deep in the secondary.  When you are in the mood, there are times that this album is a good choice.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is really a funny sort of film. The dialogue is sparse and the portrayal of Japan is at times close to racism. Yet it is strangely effective and gets you in. Probably the reason for that is that the subject matter of the film is treated with a subtly unusual in American films. It is not about the easy resolution of longings by a happy ending. It is more like the 1930's British film Brief Encounter which was about two people who meet on a train station and develop a deep affection for each other. An affection which can never go anywhere as they are both committed to their families. <br />In this film Scarlett Johanson plays a young woman who is coming to the realisation that she has married an idiot. Bill Murray plays an actor who has passed the peak of his career and faces the part of his life which is all downhill. Their brief friendship develops as a result of their alienation from the strange world of contemporary Japan they find themselves in.  <br />The film is funny but in a less frantic way than Murray's usual films. Some of the gags are close to objectionable with some ancient routines about Japanese being short, obsessed with business cards and the like. However others simply work. The attraction of the film however is more the affection that you feel for the characters. One feels for Johanson trapped in her relationship, not working dependant on a jerk. Murray also plays an attractive character. A person deeply committed to his children, a bit on auto pilot but who is able to handle Johanson's character without crudeness or the sort of resolution which occurs in Hollywood movies.
0060392886|5.0|The Crue is my all time favorite Band.  All Crue Fans Should Own This Book.  A must have gem.  They did not hold back on this one.  The Book proves they are a Motley Crue.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen, what is the storyline, really boring from beginning to end,  what a big dissapointment, I would not recommend it at all.  How did they get to nominate this movie for an award,  I should have read the users review first before I have spent my money and waste it.  Im really sorry for my comments here but I know which is good and which is bad movies.  They don't have 0 out of 5 stars that's why I have to put 1 star!!
B00005JLKN|2.0|An extraordinary cast and top-notch production values can't redeem this exercise in rehashed mediocrity.  Watson, Fiennes, Norton, Hoffman, Hopkins, &amp; Keitel--rarely has so much A-list star-power been gathered together to so little effect. We have seen it all far too many times before, and both SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and the B-grade MANHUNTER did it much better.  No matter how slick the packaging, there's still a loaf of stale white bread inside.  Even a gourmet like Lector would be hard-pressed to concoct an interesting dish from such bland ingredients.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Unquestionably the biggest breath of fresh air for me in the year 2003 was Noe's second unnerving, inspiring and overall pessimistic film.  Here, I would argue, he has painted a masterpiece.<br /><br />The movie counts backwards from one tragedy and to another as we see what caused the first inexplicable and horrific sequence to occur and then each and every scene before that.  It is intense, entertaining, shocking and edgy as hell.  Films like this push the bar far enough and are done with just enough mainstream appeal and pure talent that they gain some steam and attention and permanantly transform how we view, enjoy and create cinema.  This film is about as ugly as you can get but doesn't seem to wallow in any of it's content to the point where it could be deemed gratuitous...no matter how long it really lingers.  It's easy for some to turn away and say this is junk for showing you things you do not want to see (e.g. realistic rape and murder) but it is still important to allow total freedom of expression; and Noe's work, whether intentionally or not makes him an advocate for such expression.  He is also technically as strong as anyone in Hollywood.<br /><br />The infamous rape sequence that led to many viewers walking out of the theater seems to have an amazing effect on the audience.  I have a mini-cinema in my house and I show this movie to people as often as I can.  The same things happens.  Just as the rape scene reaches a point that makes us uncomfortable enough to consider getting angry with the movie and leave the room, it ends.  I'm inclined to say that this is intentional.  Rape should never be expressed in a film in any other way.  It should make us uncomfortable and scared.  Unfortunately, most of us are so desensitized to violence and it's consequences, that it takes a sequence like this to get under our skin.  Make no mistake about it, if a movie that handles subject matter like this gets under your skin then it has done it's job better than most.<br /><br />You'll get your money's worth here despite it's grainy and cheap feel.  The film is done that way to make the scenes more raw and believable obviously.  The beginning murder sequence is handled so delicately (as evident by the special effects overview on the DVD) that it makes me shiver as to why a filmmaker would got to this extent to show us something this horrible.  Well it all makes sense in perspective, trust me.  Gaspar Noe is a true artist and Irreversible is a great film that I will recommend to anyone willing to handle it's content.your money's worth here despite it's grainy and cheap feel.

B00008PW2D|3.0|I enjoyed the episodes but was disappointed that I payed more for 2 DVD's and 8 episodes than I did for seasons 3 and 4 with about 8 episodes on each of the 3 disks!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I believe at the drive-in are/were one of the greatest bands ever and this album was a perfect note to end on. Their earlier albums were great and crossed over from 'poppy punk' to EMO with songs that would get stuck in your head for days.<br />This album however sounds extremely professional and has the perfect progression throughout. Kicking off with Arcarsenal which is an absolute rocking track that should send shivers down your spine with its raw energy leading you into Pattern Against User which just shows how good a band they are. Then comes the explosion of One Armed Scissor which is one of my personal best songs ever.<BR>Mid album comes Enfilade which is an amazing track with a chorus which you have to shout along to wherever you are.<br />The closing track Non-Zero Possibility is the perfect full stop to their final album and should set you up for your day whatever you're into.<BR>10/10 album from a 10/10 band.<BR>At the drive-in are going to be missed but Mars Volta and Sparta should keep us all going.<br />Enjoy listening, im sure you will.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill bill was an awsome flick to watch.<BR>It wasnt tarnatinos best but it was an awsome movie to <BR>watch.  The cast members were better than perfect with the <BR>casts of uma thurman,david carridine,michal madeson,lucy lui,vivaca A fox and more.  The movie is a simple revenge movie with lota action.  This was probably the most entertaining movie of 03.  The anim was beatifly made done for lucy luis character.<br />The story is simple.  Uma thurma(Bride)is beatin and killed.<BR>But some how she survives.  Her boss bill kills her on the day of her wedding and now Bride returns after few months in <BR>coma and now looking for reveng.  Now all she wants to do is<BR>kill all the members who beat her to death and the man who put a bullet in her head...Bill.  This isnt just another revenge movie.<BR>Its tarantino's Revenge Movie!  Tarantino needs no introduction cause he knows what the hell hes doing.  <BR>The film is filled with action.  I cant really explain any thing or use big words cause IM just not that type of person.  <BR>Uma thurman did marvales in this movie.  I applaud her for this.<BR>She hadnt bin in a movie for a while to.  The only movie she stard in was an HBO original movie Wich she did great in!<BR>Im glad how they took parts from the whole movie and seperated them so they make it into 2 part epic adventure.  <BR>The movie is very entertaining and extreamly violent filled with gore decapitation and lots and lots of blood spraying.  If it wasnt for the black and white this movie would have bin NC-17.<BR>For one example an asian girl who works for yakuzas ask this man if she wants to have sex with him.  When the man says she jams a broken glass bottle of wisky into the mans stomach,when she takes<BR>it out his intestince and liver start spraying out of his stomach all over the place.  Its Very Violent!<br />But that shouldnt stop you from watching this wild and entertaining film.<BR>I cant wait till 2 and 1 on dvd come out!
B0001BKAEE|5.0|well its been over four years since the first Matrix blew us all away.  Reloaded came out showed some cool stuff but made the characters look just like the machines. Now don't get me wroung seeing Neo beat over fifty smith copies with a pole was very cool but didn't show fight for survival like the first one.  Revolutions changed all that.  The story was fantastic and the CGI... their are no words.  Battle in Zion make the Clone wars look like cat fight.  The final fight between Neo and Smith was remarkable.  Being an Anima fan it was great some Dragonball Z in that fight.  The ending was what I hoped for, satisfying but still making you ask question.  All in all the perfect ending to a perfect trilogy.  GOD BLESS LARRY and ANDY WACHOWSKI
B00005JN08|2.0|Eurotrip was suppose to be funny as hell.  It wasnt. Well for me<BR>it wasn't.  Its not the best or greatest comedy I've seen but its stupid enough to make you laugh like a bit.  The plot was stupid and cheezy. THIS GIRL FROM OUT OF NO WERE DOESNT EVEN NO THIS GUY AND SHE WANTS TO BE WITH HIM!  Unless all german girls are really like that than never mind about it. The movie wasn't as good as rode trip I can tell you that.  The characters were lame and stupid.  The stories ending didn't make me really enjoy the movie.  I hate it that all teenager flicks alway have to make an ending when the main character gets the girl.  Why cant they make a different ending wich lets you think and say \\"thats not how I pictured it\\".  Well if you wanna pay nine bucks for this crap be my guess.  I shouldn't have but you make the dessision.<br />I recommend you watch Club Dred.  That will funny.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In 2000, two of the 90's top rock bands disbanded. Soundgarden, with its moody dark riffs that mad the early 90's grunge scene spectacular, and my beloved Rage Against The Machine, with its socio-political malage of rap, funk amd metal that has influenced 7 out of 10 bands cluttering up the radio these days. When I heard that Soundgarden's lead singer and Rage's rhythm section would be joining forces; I , like many, was excited. Though it isn't as monumental as I expected, this easily stands out among the somewhat tired mainstream rock scene these days. I wish they would have continued in Rage's political vein,considering the politcal discourse in the world but you can't hate 'em for going in another direction. This album might be characterized as Parliment Funkadelic meets Temple Of The Dog; Chris Cornell's high shrieking vocals could make Mariah Carey and Minnie Riperton run for cover, and Tom Morello solidifies his title as the best guitar player of the last 10 years(yeah, I said it). Like I said, this isn't a monumental breakthrough, but after all, it is only their FIRST album.........
B00019PDKC|5.0|a lot of people dont think this album is any good. i cant see why. yes, it is a lot different then i excepted, and it took me a few listens to get used to it, but now i can't stop listening to it. i bought it when it came out in november in england, and i've been listening to it ever since. i love Are You There? it is one of the best songs i've ever heard. i don't know i just love the song, espically the warm, calming music. Flying, Electricity, and A Natural Disaster are also among my favorites.
B0000B3FCX|3.0|I really don't know what to say about Nickleback. If you're into super heavy rock like me(80's Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament,etc), they're not for you. If you like classic punk(Bad Brains, The Clash, etc), there not for you. If you like early 90's grunge(Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam), there not for you. Or if nu-metal's your thing(Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit), look elsewhere. The problem is that their sound doesn't stand out in the rock world; Creed, Puddle Of Mudd, Godsmack , Staind and others are pretty much doing the exact same thing. But the bands I just mentioned do put out solid material, and so does Nickleback. Silver Side Up is better than this,but not by much. Before the album came out, the band said that this album would be a hybrid of Metallica and Pantera,which would essentally make it one of the heaviest albums ever. Though I laughed my head off at the statement, I bought the album anyway. Only get it if you're a hardcore fan.
B00000099Y|5.0|I bought this CD after a reccomendation from a friend, and when I took it home and listened to it, I was completely awestruck. The guitar riffs are well-played and distorted nicely. The so-called \\"white noise\\" people seem to be so upset about is nonexistent. If you actually listen to the CD before writing a review about it... well, it's helpful ;) The lyrics are amazing. The depth of subject matter is fascinating (perhaps more in 'Stinkfist' than in 'Hooker with a penis') and the song 'Eulogy' made me think for days. I thoroughly enjoyed this album and I can listen to it over and over and never get sick of it. <br />Oh, and by the way... Mr. Drummer? If you think playing the songs on this CD take no talent, then maybe you should pick up a guitar and see how well you do. Go ahead. Try.
B000089RVX|4.0|Let me get some things out of the way; this is NOT a metal CD! As a long time fan of thrash and death metal, this is far from it. This is a very solid collection of aternative rock songs with metal influence;though somebody called them a co-ed version of Metallica, I wouldn't go that far, though ex-guitarist Ben Moody drops some Metallica-like riffs on the album. This group's driving force is the beautiful and talented Amy Lee; I mean this girl can BLOW!(She can sing, that is). She is the second best young Caucasian vocalist around, next to Christina Aguliera. Her haunting voice puctuates every song and envokes emotions mixed with and opera and classic soul voice; kind of like a mix of Aretha Franklin and Lena Horne(high praise, indeed). Though I like mostly every song ,the semi-operetta &quot;My Immortal&quot; is the stand out for me. Overall, this is a solid investment and alternative to the majority of the mainstream rock scene.
0385507755|5.0|Those who have been critical of James Frey and his book are so obviously envious of him it tells us way more about these &quot;critics&quot; than it does Frey.  Perhaps they are personality disordered?  Sure sounds like it.<br />A first lesson for successfully staying clean is to acknowledge that addicts come from all walks of life.  Those who don't will never make it...in the long run, if they even get that far.<br />I'm pretty sure Mr. Frey sees these two shabby attempts at copying his style as what they really are: the sincerest form of flattery.  These two folks are jealous to the bone.  I wonder how many books either has written, much less had published...to such near universal acclaim?<br />It was not until after I finished reading this searingly genuine expose on the &quot;famed&quot; treatment center, that I realized I had done my stint there about 6 months prior.<br />This book has it all...truth, love, pain, humanity, laughs - but above all - truth.<br />Kudos to you, bud...you tell it like it is.  Incidentally, I followed my own path also...hey, it worked for me, too.  Who would have thunk it?
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie is a great film. I'm a dude, so this is from a guys perspective. Jamie Lee Curtis, you would see in &quot;halloween&quot; and &quot;true lies&quot;. In this film she takes a different role as a teenage mother. Lindsay Lohan you would see here in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. The acting is really good. Its a movie that is really funny. And usually I'm not use to these type of movies like &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot;. Like what the f***! This is a chick flick but you guys would really like this film. It is a film that is funny and smart. Its a must see.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love Sarah McLachlan. I first heard her on the radio singing 'Adia' and wondered who this woman with the ethereal voice was. She captured my interest like no one else had, and I took it upon myself to discover who she was. It resulted in my purchase of 'Surfacing', which is to date my favourite album of all time out of all other albums that I own by any artist of any genre. It's soothing melodies and beautiful lyrics have brought many a tear to my eye when I felt depressed or contemplative. Here was an album that took the sadness of life seriously, and wasn't shy to speak full-heartedly about it.<br />Six years later, and Sarah McLachlan returns with 'Afterglow'. The second I heard she was planning to release this album, even before she had released its name, I resolved to buy it. As fate would have it, it isn't easy finding it around here, but thanks to a good friend, I am now listening to it.<br />Upon initial listen, I loved some songs instantly but had a few doubts about others. I later realized that this was because they take longer to grow on you. On 'Surfacing', there were songs on the album that I needed to give time to, which I eventually found I really loved due to their little idiosyncratic nuances. I would listen to these songs, like 'Witness', 'Black & White', and the pleasantly haunting 'Last Dance', long after I was weaned from songs like 'Adia'. Indeed, I find that 'Train Wreck' is much similar to the tempo and feel of 'Black & White', and 'Stupid' seems to me like a musically stronger version of 'Witness'.<br />However, I don't really like comparisons because this album has enough merit of its own. There are some that would call 'Afterglow' insipid, boring or just not good. But really, this album can grip you and pull you in not because it possesses the transient quality of Top 40 radio singles which are, at first hearing, catchy and upbeat. Those kinds of songs are fun for a few weeks, then get boring. This album is intensely appealing because the beauty of its songs lasts longer. Yet, its longevity doesn't lie in how it grips you on first, second or third listen, nor does it lie in the fact that it's lyrics and music are inherently inspiring.<br />No, it is because of the fact that these songs continue to sound good each time you listen to them. When you play this album, it seems to make more sense and touch a different unknown chord in you each time. That is why I can still listen to 'Surfacing' after all this time and feel touched, and I have no doubt that 'Afterglow' will be the same.<br />I'm glad Sarah's back because I finally have a second album to name as my favourite. My only dilemma now is deciding which I like better.e beauty of its songs lasts longer. Yet, its longevity doesn't lie in how it grips you on first, second or third listen, nor does it lie in the fact that it's lyrics and music are inherently inspiring. <br />No, it is because of the fact that these songs continue to sound good each time you listen to them. When you play this album, it seems to make more sense and touch a different unknown chord in you each time.
