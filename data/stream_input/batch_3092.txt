B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I can't believe we got all the movies for such an incredible price. Sure it's not the collectors box addition but my family is very happy with our purchase. Starting to have Star Trek movie nights with our friends. Does this make us nerd?
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I absolutely love Aiden and Alex!  This book had me biting my nails, laughing, and crying!  What an amazing ending to this series!  I love Jennifer Armentrout's writing and she again lived up to my expectations!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I'm so in love with this album. John Mayer is beyond talented and it's nice to hear him grow up a little.
B000683VI4|4.0|Beautiful performances, story of many dimensions. Perfect vehicle for a starring role. Have loved the heroine ever since but never found anything quite as significant as this story
B00006CXSS|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he couldn't be happier. It arrived quickly and in great shape. Got to love some Band of Brothers.
6304696566|5.0|One of the three greatest Westerns of all time and surely a singularly great American movie in any genre. Don't miss it!
0140120416|5.0|I am currently studying Russian and have really enjoyed reading this book. This book has given me the tools todo so.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|All my friends raved about this game, but it costs real money to try again without waiting when your out of lives. I just want one game on here that doesn't have in app purchasing!
B001DJLCRC|3.0|Yes, eye candy when willing to zone out. But, essentially, depressing. The characters evoke no sympathy--except, perhaps Walt, because they are totally self absorbed and mindless. His family is a particular disaster--selfish, obnoxious, and short sighted. I tried watching the series in the early evening so I don't carry these nightmarish situations and characters to bed. Really, self indulgent without grace, learning or redemption., Truly a saddening depiction the second decade of the 21 St. Century. Glad I'll miss most of the rest...RIP.
1603425381|3.0|Its Ok. Explanations are useful and clever I have learnt specially what to do at the corner of my projects, that's fine. Besides, I should like to see modern designs along with these, that are so classical. I have only read parts of the book, yet
B001RTSPVY|3.0|The news gets worse--Walt's dying, his wife and son are so clueless that they don't even know he's trying but dying; his idiot brother in law is still making obnoxious jokes and doesn't have a clue about other people's lives; his wife (the sister)  drifts downward into a pathetic space that makes even the sight of her painful.<br /><br />But then there's the virtue of her shoplifting...Go girl.  There must be a talent / runway/ \\"stealing with the stars\\" show in the wings.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is great. It's the end of society. Finally, an end to the Sacred-Profane/ High Culture-low Culture  continuum. Yeah, so what? I'll still get mine before you die, bro. What's the Big Deal. Too munching thinking for now. Gotta check my Twitter stock.<br /><br />Back to Breaking Bad: The kid/partner/Yo! is so without moral, emotional, social, career, or life insight that he's a drift like the smoke from his bong. It's the death of introspection & the pretext of a social contract. Hey, whatever... no judgements, no fiber, no nothin' expect going with \\"some flow,\\" man. Btw: got a Special Sale Promo eMail on a combo --pair of True  Religion hand washed jeans (black) and a V-neck Psycho-Bunny shirt (red). So must speed this up. If you're slow, you lose dough, ya know!<br /><br /> Sorry if this show gives your life meaning, but maybe you should sponsor a child or read a good book. But, hey, whatever man, no hassels, no strings. If you can get over your G-friend choking on here vomit and feeling sorry for yourself for a (short) while, then this is a Great sho! Just watch the Swiss cheese-meth holes in your head before driving--I mean, like, I'm on the road, too.<br /><br />Overall, a truly new An American Classic. Death of a Salesman, who's Afraid of VW, Kill a Mockingbird--like so old and so dead. Forgetabboutit!  Like,this is very REAL. Dead on (no pun). Complete. Makes my day. Whatever...Just don't remind me that I went to college! I  can still  attend \\"Mindfulness Seminars\\" to improve my concentration and competitiveness around Seattle or when they catch on in Manhattan's Upper West Side as long as my media streams, everything is Cool. Like Miley (love her, too!).<br /><br />In the meantime, a real dilemma. Forget all \\"sick and suffering\\" I've got to put up  a family foundation to harness my energy. That and watching all the episodes of BB will improve my karma, get me more hits on Social Media and make me a more evolved, planetary person.<br /><br />No Judgements, Except going to the gym is like very, very important. PS: a real bargain is taking the Mindfulness Seminars & signing up for the newsletter at 18k for 6 months with suggestions about how to Think like a clearer person --I swear it helps! My G-d, this is changing my life--like forever. Go Walt, Go cook! You're an entrepeneur and I love you!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Worked great, thank you!! Great shipping and packaging,and so glad I bought it! One f the best movies ever, now I have all the scary movies
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. Grisham never lets us down! The ending was really the icing on the cake.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|This book is touching and real. I loved every turn! Capturing the love, pain, happiness and sadness was impeccable, thank you!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The packaging is slick, and the on-screen setup instructions are very conversational and friendly; Except when the device is unable to connect to your own wireless network. In this day and age, it's assumed that one should go online (to Google) and search out the reason for any problem. But still, it would have been nice if this little gizmo had given me some little hint, code number, anything to help me narrow down the cause.<br /><br />Turns out, my Verizon router needed a reclusive setting changed (I'm not a home office router, I'm a broadband router!) - a fix which was NOT suggested on Google's list for my device - but rather buried in a discussion group on an entirely different site.<br /><br />So now this little fob is working, and streamed a $9 Disney SD animated movie crisply and clearly, with no lag at all.<br /><br />I'd love to report on other media, but I'm not a fan of Netflix since their debacle of a few years back, and Google has not made nice with Amazon yet (where most of my paid content sits). I've been shopping their \\"Movies & TV\\" app, but am not yet satisfied with the selection or prices (only one season of Futurama? Seriously?). That leaves Hulu.<br /><br />I pray that Google has plans to join up with some more vendors soon (like Amazon) - and not just copy the Microsoft model of gently forcing us to use their own services whenever possible on their own hardware.<br /><br />The ability for my wife to \\"cast\\" her Chrome browser page onto the TV - so I can watch the same Facebook clip as her - is pretty sweet. I can cast YouTube video from my phone too. This thing has potential - and even current reward for the geek in some of us - and is a worthwhile gizmo if your TV does not have any media apps built-in.<br /><br />EDIT: Months later and there's no App to play Amazon Instant Videos on Chromecast. Rumor now is that it's Amazon's call, and they won't do it - citing some red herring about which media player to encode for (Buy a Kindle!).<br /><br />So in retrospect, it seems disingenuous for Amazon to sell something that won't Play with Amazon. So Google's product suffers as a result, and it's probably too late to return it. Not too late to start buying my videos elsewhere though!So in retrospect, it seems disingenuous for Amazon to sell something that won't Play with Amazon.

1423140591|4.0|Well written. There is a serious research on all the historic elements even on the Roman mythology, which is often less known than the Greek one. The many characters have all their space in the story and have all their unique characteristics that make you love them (or hate them).
B00A86AIAI|5.0|Just awesome...what else can I say. Highly recommended for any Batman Fan. The magnets are strong enough to keep the figure planted solid on the stand.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Set in the late 1970's in an Ohio town, &#34;Super 8&#34; perfectly represents the small town atmosphere of the era; the clothing, cars, appliances and cultural references are all perfectly tuned to the time. A group of nerdy middle school kids is focused on creating a zombie movie for a competition when they witness a horrific accident at the train station, but they're not convinced that it was an accident. When the super 8 film is finally developed a few days later, they know that something bizarre has happened in their town. The inexplicable occurrences start to mount - people and metallic objects gone missing, power disturbances, dogs that have run away, cars that won't operate, etc. In a town meeting, the locals claim that the Soviets are to blame. I had to remember back to that era to be reminded of what a threat Russia was back then !<br /><br />The human plot centers around two kids, both of whom have lost one parent and are struggling to relate to the remaining damaged parent. The monster plot centers around an extra terrestrial being that has apparently gotten stuck on earth and can't find a way back home (remember ET?). The visual and plot references to the monster are rather confusing and conflicted - is it a good monster or a bad monster? Even the glimpses of the monster are brief and incomplete.<br /><br />Eventually the plot all comes together and the loose ends are tied up in a satisfactory way. The special effects are superb, as expected from a Spielberg film, and the acting, given that a bunch of 12-13 year olds are the main characters, is believable. It is an entertaining and interesting movie, though certainly not with the universal appeal of ET.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I will have to bear a mourning period for many reasons after reading this. I think this book captured a piece of my soul. It will forever be a part of me. I have always escaped into my books, but I was seized and became a part of it. I felt their pain and joy and loss as if it were my own. I was EVERY character and was a part of their lives and it broke a part of me that can never be mended and I don't want it to. It made me feel empowered, grateful, feeble & depraved all at once. I do not feel I deserve what I have, and tonight when my son said he was starving & didn't like dinner. I simply said. &#34;There are people who only have pea soup & a small piece of bread every day & if they are lucky enough to have an apple...well THAT is their joy.&#34; This book is brilliant, amazing and a little bit of reality we all need to understand. Even though this book is fiction. This is real and this is a piece of a story of so many lives. Read it and be thankful every day, for what you have.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I've read all the sookie books and I love every one of them. Can't wait for the next one and the next one, etc.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|at first I saw my friend play it I thought it was all right bit then I played it and it was addicting toatelly worth it and better get it soon or they might make you pay for the app later
0345803485|1.0|If you're looking for a high school type romance full of petulance as you roll your eyes, read this book.  I agree with other reviews, the sex scenes are hot and steamy but by the 20th orgasm (which happen every time and simultaneously), you're actually bored with them.  I wish I had never picked up the first one because although they are terrible, I did want to find out how it all wrapped up and wasted my time reading all 3 which I regret.  I should have just read the first one and the last 2 chapters of the 3rd.  Don't bother with this series!  If you're really curious about the sex scenes, just read a few chapters of any of them, get your erotica fill and be done.
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|I lost interest in Sting albums about the same time he did, apparently - around &#34;Desert Rose.&#34; After hearing him on Steve Nieve's latest album (10 stars, by the way) & reading similar things about this album (i.e. the composer's renditions of songs destined for the stage) I had high hopes for a return to form.  Instead, I found this to be a mid-tempo album, very bland, without variety in the songs or in the melodies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive and fun just as everyone told me it was lol I just wish it allowed more lives so we could play longer  :)
B00D2I8E46|2.0|Interesting concept; but boring. I had high hopes for the idea of 're-purposing' some of EC's older tunes and lyrics, and the Roots are undeniably very good musicians.  But this album is almost totally dependent on rhythm and attitude, with none of the melodic and harmonic twists I look for in EC songs.  Not recommended for fans of EC.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book and the characters, I couldn't put it down. Travis is crazy to say the least and you never know how it is going to play out. The relationship is not perfect and I think that is what makes the book so good, it isn't the &#34;typical&#34; mushy love story where everything falls into place. Its messy and raw and definitely a good read!
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|Very good film.  I love Joss Wheaton's other projects, and I adore Clark Gregg and Alexis Denisof as actors.  The performance was well done.
140006922X|4.0|Though I did not agree with all the conclusions made by the author, I felt that the book gave an well documented look at the life and times of Jesus that are not found in the Bible.  Information on the historical Jesus helps me better understand how  he reacted to the people of his day.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Wonderful, warm but sad book.  Sad because there is much truth to this fiction.  The human spirit can be beautiful.
B00CITOS4A|4.0|This book was a very helpful resource.  Well written, even with the hokey humor.  The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five, is that I suspect that this is one of those books that one should really have the physical copy, not an e-book.  So that rating drop is not towards the author.  It's more difficult to view his examples in an e-book.<br /><br />I love my Kindle, but there just are some books that an e-book doesn't work as well.  This is one.  However, his writing is clear and I learned quite a bit of new information.  It's got me even more excited to receive my new Lumix DMC-FZ200 and try some of the techniques.<br /><br />I'm thinking for some, a basics book might be better.  He tends to show an example and then say, &#34;this is how I did it&#34;.  Add a basic book to this book in your library, which I plan to do - and I think it'd be a perfect combination.  I do think highly enough of his writing and style that I will purchase his Photoshop Elements 12 book (in physical format) when it comes out.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The previous book, while I enjoyed it, seemed like it was lacking something that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Maybe the lack of main characters that were so crucial to the point and made me kind of Leary of paying so much for the 5th book.  But I was my disappointed. All my favorites were back, the twists and turns were great and we even have a wonderful set up for all the new characters as well.  Can't wait for season four and I can't wait for book 6!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Great! It is fun to see the original classic version after the new high tech Star Trek movies out now.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's fairly easy set up. I love that I can stream things like Google Play on the tv but I can't wait until there are more apps available.  Cool device/technology!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I absolutely loved Divergent.  My daughter's high school Literature class read it and I encouraged all my friends who like YA books to read it.  But I just don't have anything good to say about this book.  It was such a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to the movie but I don't know if I will even go now.  The whole story is ruined for me.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is not a book review in typical sense of the word. Here you won't find what is good and bad about this book. There are plenty of other book reviews here on amazon that can better help you in making a decision whether to read this book or not. I enjoyed reading this book and James writing helped me identify how I am holding myself back from living life to its fullest. This review is my expression of gratitude to James for writing this book.<br /><br />This book is different from many other self help books for more than one reason. It is written from the heart and not the head. Also, it is based more on experience than on theory. The suggestions for improving the quality of life in this book are based not on case studies that cover a wide audience but on author's personal experience. This fact makes the book tremendously helpful to those who can relate to where the author is coming from and do not judge the book based on its style and grammar.<br /><br />The book is based on a simple premise - You should be your number one priority in life. Choose Yourself. From birth we are conditioned to please others and worry about what other think of us. This obsession with how I am going to be perceived by others is the biggest roadblock to living a joyful and fulfilling life. In this book James reveals how he craved approval from others in the form of business deals and other worldly goodies and how that caused him heartache and pain. This is followed by action items and exercises one can do to break free of this need for approval on the path to choosing yourself.<br /><br />Before reading this book I used to believe that for a book to be helpful author has to share my point of view on everything. I gotta say that I disagree with James on many things but those disagreements are based on personal lifestyle preferences and not on deeper life principals. Reason I mention this here is because this fact may be stopping you from a very enjoyable and enriching experience. Pleasedon't let it do so. Have an open mind and buy a kindle edition of the book for only 2 bucks.<br /><br />I would recommend that anyone who is remotely contemplating to read this book grab a kindle copy for only 1.99 even if you don't own a kindle. I don't own one either, but I installed the kindle app on mac (there is one for PC as well) and read it there. It just might be life changer. If not, you can always skip Starbucks for a day and cover your losses :)
1449305172|5.0|Mauyra gets how experimentation can create advantaged knowledge and enable discovery. Running LEAN is a logical roadmap to engage your market to gain feedback and insight. I highly recommend the book for entrepreneurs and founders.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I wasn't sure about this game at first,  but as you progress through the levels it gets more challenging.  I got it as the free app of the day, but it is worth paying for!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was forced to read this book by one if my friends and I'm extremely glad that I did I love the way john Green writes about Hazel and Augustus' relationship an how they fell for each other this book literally made me bawl my eyes out for hours
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My four year old loves this game! It is so cute and it follows the show so well, however, it can become expensive if you don't watch it closely. The parental locks keep her from buying more gems every time a new quest that's uses gems pops up, but that doesn't stop her from asking constantly. I really feel that if the game asks an age maybe it should mean more than blocking social media? How about another way to get the pony's she wants, like buying gems with the coins you earn from your shops??? Just a thought...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I found it fun but not terribly different from other games though it was a bit more jazzy and definitely more colorful.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I ordered the LEGO Minecraft (Original) 21102 as a Christmas gift for my grandson so it hasn't been opened yet.  While the set was competitively priced, arrived on time, and was as described on Amazon's website, I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't meet my expectations as to the size of the kit (although it is stated on the website).  I incorrectly assumed from looking at the photo provided that it would come in a box about 1 cubic foot in size but the actual volume is only about 0.0746 cubic feet (4.8 X 4.8 X 5.6 inches).  That's not a lot of plastic for $34.95 (which has subsequently been reduced to $32.79).
B000I8ES70|1.0|Yuck! Ordered it for my boyfriend he liked it but then only watched half the movie! Not because he didn't want to see it, or didn't<br />like it, just to aggravate me. He woke up in the middle of the night and watched the other half! YUCK! is my opinion!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Not as easy as it looks. Challenges you.<br />Great way to pass the time and compete with friends. Came in useful at the airport waiting on a flight.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it is really fun!!!! I can win one mini game and play the next. u never have to stop.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is an excellent album. From the songwriting comes a variety of great songs. The production level is top notch and sounds great on my top notch system that I could not afford back when the 80's Stryper was rocking. The artwork is colorful and reminiscent of classic Stryper. This album is a strong 5 star piece of work!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|so I purchased this app for my kindle fire and was so excited but as I was playing I needed a ladder so I typed it in and there was no way to exit and place my creation so someone plz help me figure it out.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Well written, interesting story.  I am a huge Ken Follett fan and haven't found a book written by him that was disappointing.
1423113497|5.0|I got hooked on these books when my girlfriend swore that she would force me to read them. I am on book three now and have not been let down for one moment!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Wow. This book is officially my favorite book of all time. It was so amazing!!!!! I don't know what to say, there are literally no words to describe this masterpiece of a book! I'm so sad that this series is over, it's the end of  Alex and Aiden's journey, but I'm completely content and satisfied with the ending. The Covenant series has been THE BEST book series that I have ever read and I wish that it would go on forever, but it can't. So this ending was perfect and now I can rest in peace even though that the series is over. I'll love Aiden forever and sure are going to miss him ALOT, and of course I'll miss the witty, smart, AMAZING Alex that I've come to know and love. If I want to laugh, I'd just have to read one of these books, between Alex, Apollo, Seth, Aiden and all of the other characters in this book, I'll be grabbing my sides from the pain of so much laughter by the end of the minute. Jenifer has done an OUTSTANDING job with this book series  and I can't wait to see what else she publishes next. I am a fan of the lux series also by her and can't wait for the next book coming out this summer!!!! Good-bye Covenant series!!!!!! I will miss u! Even though I'll probably read the series 50 times a year!!!!!! And I'm not kidding, that is totally legit!!!!! I'll miss this series and can't wait to see what comes out next!!!!!!!!
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|All that buzz about the new Stryper record you have been hearing, it lives up to it! This record takes the new production values of Today (Second Coming) and melds it with what makes Stryper great (catchy hard riffs, Godly message). Its almost like they wrote all of these songs in 1989 but then decided to wait until 2013 to record them. By now you have probably heard that its on the same level as To Hell With the Devil or Soldiers Under Command, well it is!<br /><br />I grew up, musically and spiritually, with this band. These days great christian music is easy to find but when Stryper was getting started there was no other viable option for those of us who like hard rock/metal music. However I will be the first to admit their new music has been hit and miss the past few records. While I really enjoyed Murder By Pride I really had no interest in The Covering. I love Second Coming but but Reborn was spotty at best for me.<br /><br />No More Hell To Pay is a return to what made the band great!
B00F91G5BS|5.0|Better than I expected. Pretty cool movie, and well worth the money to go see it or rent it !
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great selection of beautiful and realistic sounds. Look forward to going to sleep each night to test out a new mix.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is an interesting show that really gets away from the soft nature of vampires potrayed in the Twighlight series. That being said, it is not for children and should only be viewed by adults.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|after watching it in the movie theater, my daughter wanted to see it again, so I ordered it through amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really hate waiting on quests but the game is great. I can play for it for hours and hours
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Excellent book.  What a remarkable young girl.  What a tragedy in her country.  Education is the only hope the human race has to insure its continuation, let alone alone its progress.  Yet, not just her country but  the whole world is filled with those who refuse to be rational, who are ruled by fear which leads to hatred.  How many of us could rise to speak out as Malala has?
0345535421|1.0|book in sad shape - spine broken - pages loose ans fall from the book!!!! except for that it's great.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Okay I don't necessarily love this game, but I didn't download it for me. I got it for my 2 boys (6 and 3) who are obsessed with Star Wars & Angry Birds. When it finally became free, I got it. I have to keep close track of how long my boys play this for because they could honestly be on it all day! Great for keeping them entertained at the Dr's office and other places!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is an amazing app! It allows you to adjust the volume of each sound and select any combination of 10 sounds at a time. I have always loved the soothing sound of rain. There are so many options to make the perfect storm. I found the combination that best suits me. I use this app at work and even while reading. It is the best thing to quiet my racing mind while sleeping. This app is great for those who love nature sounds, such as birds and crickets. There are various water sounds such as the ocean and river. There are wind and thunder sounds. For the spiritual there are chanting, Zen, and vibration sounds. For music lovers there are quite a few instrumentals and there's even a lullaby. If you are into vacuum's and white noise, it has that too! Enjoy!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I cannot believe what I'm hearing! These guys have just released their finest piece of work, ever.<br /><br />Who would have thought that of every band that emerged from the Sunset Strip in the early 80's, that it would be Stryper that would be carrying the mantle into 2013. They are the undisputed champs coming from the genre.<br /><br />Incredibly fresh hooks, a two headed guitar assault from Oz and Michael, a rhythm expo by R. Sweet and Gaines, and soaring vocals that are not suppose to be possible at Michael Sweet's age, is what you'll find on this record.<br /><br />I'm just sort of stunned. The record, songs, musicianship, and production are that good. I would say it fits nicely after &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34;, but what I want people to know, is that this is, IMO, a much finer work. It is as if, unlike Motley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Ratt....even Def Leppard and say, Scorpions....these guys have grown to be better, not just trying to find their former glory.<br /><br />A definite &#34;must buy&#34;.
0394818237|5.0|This is a must-have book for 2-4 year old boys. It's my go-to birthday gift, especially for 3 year olds.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I think this one was really good.  in the end love won.  I also enjoyed this book.  Could not put it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is solid drama, great characters, and an excellent view into life during and up to the world war.  The characters are superb and you get caught up with them really fast.  The stories really move fast, its like a short story - no fluff and everything is important.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|splendid graphics and game play keeps me going never bored its about time someone got this right bravo bravo bravo what an awesome game anew its free
1582701709|5.0|It's very uplifting and positive and reminds repeatedly that your life is in your hands - make it what you want!

B003IKMR0U|4.0|Fast and easy game to play.  The theme is cool.  Avoid the shotgun blasts and devour as many BRAINS as you can!
B00008G7UF|4.0|I really enjoy this movie. It has a cute story line to it. It's a great movie to pop in and not have to put a lot of thought into it. Not to mention, I love the scenery.  It brings back memories of my travels to Europe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have ben waiting a amout of time to get it on my kindle now I just want them to put out the other games by king.com
B005544V6A|4.0|Fantastic show. Entertaining but serious, solid acting and comedic moments.....plus interesting story lines. You want to keep watching to find out the whole story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally for my kindle.... I love this game on my notebook my phone and now my kindle. this is great....my seven year grandson downloaded for me

1588167461|5.0|I first bought this book for my dad, thinking that he might enjoy reading it... well, Daddy loved it... and I proceeded to buy a copy for my best guy friends and boyfriend (they needed varying degrees of help in the dressing area).  Thank god they saw the light in this book and started shopping better.  Even though it lists pricier items, it does state where you can get by without having said pricey items.  Be painfully aware, to dress well as a man, it is going to require some money.  Dressing a man is cheap... said no one ever. However, the information provided in this attractively sarcastic book is awesome. I highly recommend... color pictures or not... buy it! In MULTIPLE QUANITITIES! Perfect gift for the college grad or the bachelor with no idea of how to dress himself for success! hope this helps!

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This is the best album Eminem has done since TES. Apart from the radio-friendly &#34;The Monster&#34; and &#34;Survival,&#34; this album is great in every aspect. It has something for everyone: It's got the old school feeling and a lot of references to the first MMLP that old fans will appreciate, a perfect balance between serious and funny/sarcastic songs that only Eminem can pull off without sounding corny, and like I said some radio-friendly and commercial songs like &#34;The Monster&#34; and &#34;Survival&#34; that some of the newer/younger fans and people who like the more pop-oriented songs will appreciate.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoilers!!  I can't believe that I became so invested in the main character only to have her die.  Now I understand why it was written from both Tris and Tobias point of view.  You had to have someone else end the story.  I am heartbroken.  I usually read books twice because I read them so fast that I need to go back over them to pick up little details but I won't be reading these the second time.  I am too upset.  I also won't be going to see the movie as I don't want to have the same ending when they get to the third book.  Completely disappointed!!

0062082841|5.0|If you are a fan of Shattered Ravings, then you know already that I love Special Features.  Watching the Making Of and other featurettes lets me get into the minds of the directors and other creative forces behind these productions and see where their inspirations come from.  This is one of my favorite things.  So when I learned one of my idols, Guillermo del Toro, had put out a book that featured some of his private notebooks, I knew I had to check it out.  And I’m so thankful I got the opportunity to do so.  This huge book is the Holy Grail of a genius filmmaker and lets us peek into one of the most imaginative minds of the new century.<br /><br />When this book came in the mail, I was almost stunned by its size.  I knew it was a big book, but wow...I didn’t know it was this big.  And that is certainly not a complaint, either.  There’s a wealth of knowledge crammed into this tome and it is something every fan of cinema should own.<br /><br />CABINET OF CURIOSITIES is not just a collection of sketches or notes about del Toro’s films; it is something far better.  This is a glimpse into a master’s mind, a small sliver of the place where PACIFIC RIM, PAN’S LABYRINTH, and CRONOS came from.  And it is amazing.  While reading through this book, I felt like Alice as she ventured through Wonderland: I didn’t know what to expect around the next bend or corner, but I knew it would be extraordinary.<br /><br />In addition to reading excerpts from his journals about each film he’s made, we also get to explore his house and see what inspires his muse.  Then, towards the end of the book, we get to see a bit of his Unfinished Projects collection, where he houses up and coming titles that have yet to be completed.  I don’t want to say too much more about this book, because you simply have to read through it to understand why I’m gushing about it.<br /><br />CABINET OF CURIOSITIES is an awesome book, and every aspiring filmmaker and/or writer should own a copy of it.  Not only do we get an inside look at del Toro’s brain, but we get a behind the scenes glance at where he makes his magic as well.  If you’re a fan of cinema or simply good storytelling, snatch this one up today.  You won’t be disappointed.f it.  Not only do we get an inside look at del Toro’s brain, but we get a behind the scenes glance at where he makes his magic as well.

B000002J1M|5.0|(I may not be alone here but) I remember listening to this album when I was 16 in the house of a guy (my hero now) Steve Batemen in (surprise) Brunei army base. Up to that point is was into Deep Purple, Jethro Tull, The Who, Beach Boys (the Beatles came even later!) and struggling at that age to find my music. I was circulating in one of those ceiling hung Emmanuel chairs when Steve casually said 'listen to this' and he played Suppers Ready! Blew my mind then and it continues to do so now to be honest.<br /><br />As one gets older music maturity becomes and as I got older I expanded my taste BUT a lot (not all) is based on that teenage experience track. When I read reviews on progressive music out today (and there is a wonderful varied selection) there is a strong reference to pre-Collins Genesis being the ultimate test almost. Nobody has every suggested any CD comes close to Foxtrot but it is very clear that as an imaginary starting point this CD is it.

1592407889|3.0|Reading this book I got the impression that MacLaine's daughter is not sure how to feel about her mother.  Her childhood was a bit bizarre.  Shirley was never there for her daughter and her career was much more important.  Her father had a bohemian lifestyle.  Seems like the author had a very lonely childhood and had to survive somehow on her own.  Interesting reading.

B002MUAJ2A|3.0|I checked out the digital edition from the library, which is probably the best way to read this book because it's very short and there's not much worth keeping. I found myself thinking \\"What kind of idiot doesn't already know all this stuff?\\" But based on the other reviews here, I guess there are plenty of people who find it helpful.<br /><br />To me, it's all common sense: Don't make things more complicated than they need to be. Don't spend too much time on things that don't matter in the beginning. Don't use stupid business jargon. Work smarter, not harder. Bigger is not necessarily better. Et cetera.<br /><br />The book is essentially the authors' philosophy on starting a new business. They don't provide any evidence to back up their views aside from their own experience. But they've obviously been successful, so their views aren't worthless. Their opinions are very similar to mine, so it was helpful to me to know that very successful entrepreneurs think the same way I do. That's a confidence-builder.<br /><br />Just don't expect to get new ideas.<br /><br />Here's the entire book in one sentence: Keep it simple.

B003YBUSMW|4.0|The Mad Catz Racing Wheel is a great beginner product. For the price I was able to get it at ( only $75 ) it was a steal. It is a definite improvement from the original Xbox Racing Wheel. Amazon has always had the best prices and support. I bought the wheel from their warehouse in used condition, but the box had just been opened and so the wheel its self had not been used. The pedals have decent feedback and precision especially for the money. The wheel has both flappy paddle gear shift and a sequential gear knob. I love that. Though I wish it was a H-Box 6 speed box, but at this level of wheels it is never going to happen. So the gear knob is a great addition. All in all, I'm really impressed with the product and would definitely recommend it. I play Forza series of games mostly but also Dirt, Grid, and occasionally NFS Most Wanted. It works great with all of those games. Mad Catz has come a really long way as far as quality and performance.

B00F031X62|3.0|This is a review of \\"Miami pop festival\\" the Jimi Hendrix experience. I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight, before it's true release. So I have listened to it twice and here is my take: for $9.99, this is a three star purchase. There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi, which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s. This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang, of pre-Woodstock fame.<br /><br />The songs on this live disc come mainly from \\"Are You Experienced...?\\" even though it's mid '68. The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier.  Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of \\"hey Joe.\\" The solo in this song really kicks. The next song, Foxy Lady, blasts off. The intro contains a whole lotta Uni-Vibe and phasing. One nice aspect is that the mixes, which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight.<br /><br /> The next song \\"Tax-free\\" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout. Noel Redding's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place, sonically speaking. Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah-wah guitar. The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining, as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early, nascent  stages of festival going.<br /><br /> I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about. What else can be said about this process? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive. Most of it has already been heard many times over. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, of course, ending up with products like \\"Valleys of Neptune \\"which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen. So with all of that said, this is a decent product. In fact it is rather good for a live recording. The only problem is the lack of material. The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling.<br /><br />The accompanying booklet with photographs that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done. The packaging is actually quite nice as well. So for $10, this is a marginal three-star buy. Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list, like Paul McCartney's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe. The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts (aka \\"Rock of Aged\\"). That one is a great example of a lame cash grab. Sad for such an amazing group. Ive heard NOTHING good about it!<br /><br />PS-I would listen to this a million times before ever suffering through friggin' ARCADE FIRE and their Ambien-rock-electronic crap that Rolling Stone seems to love so much.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm not saying I'm some amazing writer and could have written something better, but there's a reason I don't have a best seller. This book is purely being purchased because the first book was good. I almost wonder if Ms. Roth had guidance when writing the first novel and then thought she was so awesome that she could venture out on her own for the last two books?<br /><br />I will say, I am ok with the ending. I realize the author was looking for something more \\"real\\" as opposed to happily ever after. I was not at all put off by the \\"twist\\".  What put me off was the wishy washy back and forth ways the author decided to create drama and then all of a sudden deciding to tie up loose ends.... KISS.... Keep it simple stupid!  I was not on a roller coaster with the character, but with the author. I did not feel like her descriptions of Tris, the main character,  embodies the torment and angst of a post apocalyptic teenager, except for some parts of her love story. I did loved how in this future there was an equalization of the sexes. Unfortunately she went too far in this last book and ended up verbally castrating her male lead. This book made me sad because the story itself as a whole without all the intricate pieces, is a very good story! The end is a very acceptable end. It just lacks structure and plausible content. blech!
B00DPUB56U|4.0|One of the best vampire movies of the last decade, Byzantium delivers the slow pacing of a classic Gothic horror and melds two wholly different visual and story telling styles to reflect on what it means to live forever and to need blood to survive.<br /><br />Neil Jordan plays with the rules of vampires by giving them more freedom within the rules, and overall structures to struggle against. Ultimately the characters are fully imagined and the family secrets allow for dramatic tension that pull slowly until things begin to crash down around the central characters.<br /><br />Viewers (including my girlfriend) may be turned off by the very slow pacing, with little action, and sometimes little dialogue or long voice over portions, but the style pulls you into the story to make you understand the characters and their motivations to their fullest.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria is an amazing show that is intriguing for several reasons. Her show is a spinoff from Beavis and Butthead which was more popular than this one. With that said, this show is orders of magnitude more deserving. It stars a seemingly emotionally detached teen in a world full of double standards and sick sad world episodes. The characters in the show are well scripted and well developed. I would have liked to see more episodes and its a shame that the music is cut out of this show. It does take away from the whole \\"this show was on Mtv at a time when they played music\\", but those are the wonders of contracts, lawyers and time.<br /><br />I would like to see Daria back on the air. There is no reason she shouldn't be. I mean, king of the hill was on for longer. We all know there's no reason for that. There's potential for a college or even a working world Daria. Hopefully with the same people that wrote the first one. No sense in detracting from the great scripting material that they came up with. Furthermore, I'd be right there watching it...<br /><br />Great job!

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is by far the best hunting game on the kindle. The only problem is that the price of Hunter bucks and glu credits are beyond outrageous and almost scandalous. You could spend multiple of hundreds of real dollars when you could get an Xbox and an actual hunting game for about as much as you could spend on this. If you play it right you can earn hunter bucks with a lot of playing. Overall good game

1250038820|5.0|This book makes me so proud to be a NYer.  So many stories, so little time.  Great book to have.
0451219597|4.0|First off, I feel this is a 3.5 but I'm giving it 4, as some of the reviewers on here have been too harsh.<br /><br />JACKDAWS takes the standard D-Day spy stories but twists it by focusing on the Historical female agents, or, as they were known, something of the unsung heroes.<br /><br />This particular tale focuses on a female agent who is trying to knock down the phone lines of an SS HQ but needs to do it as cleaning ladies. So, after failing her first attempt, she heads back to the UK where she, and other govt officials, recruit several female agents for training.<br /><br />All of these women are untrained and have to do a crash course in spycraft.<br /><br />Thereafter, the next half of the book entails the women parachuting into France, some of them getting caught or killed and then moving in on the mission. Expect the usual \\"B\\" love story.<br /><br />Story is very good in pacing, and, while some of the characters have the archetypal element, I felt he did a good job creating a diverse selection.<br /><br />When he wrote EYE OF THE NEEDLE the market was less saturated with WWII stories. Now, they're all over the place, so, he has less of the market, the stories overlap more and expectations are higher for newer and newer stories.<br /><br />This one is above average to good but not quite either in definition. If you want to read him for the first time, I'd recommend EYE OF THE NEEDLE.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: B

B00EUGYM04|5.0|The second cd with the previous unreleased songs totally made this a great buy. As soon as i heard the song &#34;weak&#34; from the second cd i got goose bumps and has to be one of Seethers' greatest songs.
B00CEB5QU2|3.0|The device is good if you can get the app that runs it. Both Kingston and Amazon were unable or unwilling to help get the app on my android tablet that doesn't have google play, I found another device that the company sent me the app and now I am happy with it.<br />Customer service is something that Kingston and Amazon lack when it comes to android apps. I am sure the device is fine but whitout help, is obsolete or unusable. Too bad, I will give 0 stars to both of them Amazon and Kingston.
1451666179|5.0|It has recently come to my attention that when writing reviews for a product bought on Amazon, one should always list the Pros and Cons to be as informative as possible.  As someone who is an incorruptible fan of Allie Brosh's blog \\"Hyperbole and a Half\\" I took this as a challenge, knowing I would love this book with all the tendrils of my cold, dark, and relatively tiny heart.  And indeed I did!  Nevertheless, below are both positives and some alarming negatives regarding my purchase.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-This book is quite heavy.  This may be a good thing for people who are partial to getting their money's worth out of a book, but if you are either pregnant, extremely young or extremely elderly I recommend asking someone capable to rip this book in thirds down the spine to avoid any unnecessary strain.<br /><br />-This book is not edible.  Sure for most people this is a given, but remember when they printed cool stuff on fruit roll ups?  Lines get crossed and people can get confused, that's all I'm saying.<br /><br />-Not to be used while driving!  Also possibly a given, but since this involves personal experience I thought it should be included.  I read this book while driving to work one morning (Chapters 3, 4, and 5) and when I looked up from the book I was in Tulsa.  I do not work in Tulsa, and was mildly inconvenienced.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-This book contains numerous bright colors and pictures and can be used to distract babies if you are looking to score some Goldfish crackers on the cheap.  This could probably also work for Cheerios but I did not test.<br /><br />-The book is described as having 50% new material, but I have estimated it to be closer to 50.86%  I came to this conclusion without involving any actual math or proof, but I'm 101.72% certain I'm correct on this particular occasion.<br /><br />-In all seriousness, this is a lovely book that shows beautiful and rare insight from the author across a wide stretch of topics by means ofa masterful use of anecdote and personal introspective.  I read this book in its entirety in about six hours despite it being nearly 400 pages long (including several stories I'd already read in the blog, please trust me, they're worth reading twice.)  I could not put it down.  I laughed out loud like an idiot when I read about the goose and I cried a little at her revelation of depression to her friends and family (even though, like I said, I'd already read it before.)  There's something special about Allie Brosh and the characters that surround her, there's an element that can't be defined yet illuminates every story of hers I've ever read.  After I read the book I went straight to her blog to find some of my favorites that weren't included (\\"Wolves\\" and \\"The Year Kenny Loggins Ruined Christmas\\" being immediate standouts although there are so many more.)  I plan on reading the book again when I get home tonight.  It makes me happy, and that makes it an invaluable treasure.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|it is awesome i pretty much just got and have highher scores then my friends who had it for awile
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The season two was well written and the production quality was more like a movie than a television series. The acting was exceptional. My husband and I are huge fans of the BBC production Sherlock.
B00008FRWR|1.0|Very poor quality of the recording. How - if the plate is made in the alley. This order had only good envelope. Strongly not recommend. Sorry for bad english.
0307276902|4.0|I actually listened to this book on CD in the car, and it's was extra interesting that way because the reader (I don't think it was Frey) used different voices (subtly) for different characters and really captured what I pictured each person to sound like!<br /><br />The story is compelling and moves along at a brisk pace.  There is NO memoir that is 100% accurate.  People forget things over long lives...and they CERTAINLY forget tiny details of things that happen when they are loaded.  Read \\"A Piece of Cake\\" by Cupcake Brown (which was very good) and see if you buy every little nuance of what she is saying.<br /><br />Now, anything James Frey just flat out blatantly made up, I can't explain. Can't explain why.  All I know is that this (apparent) mix of fiction and nonfiction is a good read.  I always wanted to know what happened next and I was at rapt attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />I did think the ending was too pretty and neat, though.  Like a movie with sunshine ending.  I don't believe he befriended a Mafioso (though I will buy that he met SOME older guy with connections and money) and I don't believe the Mafioso paid for the girlfriend to stay on in treatment. And \\"working through issues\\" and making up with Mom and Dad in just a few sessions was, again, just too neat and made me roll my eyes.  But I do believe they were supportive and did everything they could, and in reality there were likely more sessions.<br /><br />Many ppl wondered how he got on a plane to Chicago in the medical condition he was in. But remember, a physician pretty much ordered that to happen, and since James was not unruly (he was likely passed out), the medical professionals were probably able to get him settled on a plane.  Or maybe he got to his parents some other, less glamorous way, and Frey turned it into an airplane ride.<br /><br />Bottom line: I don't care if the WHOLE thing is fiction, 100% (it has been said that the book was initially presented as a novel), and neither should anyone interested in getting lost in a good book.

B0055PMJMW|4.0|Although the reader knows the likely conclusion it would be good to close.  I liked the suspense invoked in each segment.
B00192IV0O|2.0|Although I like the Black-eyed peas, this is the first (and only) cd I have bought of theirs. Aside from the one song I bought it for, I hated it. And this was supposed to be one of the best of that year! I was disappointed.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Words fail  me to describe what I am feeling right now. Could not put the book down ,had to read on and on. I a utterly exhausted emotionally.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|I don't even know how to describe this CD.  I guess mind-blowing might work?  Why's that?  Well, the first go around I was thinking to myself, &#34;What the hell is this crap.&#34;  Some of the songs didn't even sound like Avril.  At one point I thought my Amazon Cloud Player had changed to some other band.  I actually had to check to make sure it hadn't!  That being said, I'm now on the third or fourth go around of this album.  Imagine that!<br /><br />It really grows on you.  You can hear in the songs her younger, grungier days (especially in Here's to Never Growing Up) where she was that punk-rock chick we all know and love.  But you can also hear her maturity.  She's come a long way since she first entered the scene with a tie and baggy pants.<br /><br />Her voice is still beautiful.  The background music still fits the mood of the song.  You have your typical fast songs as well as slow songs.  Avril's mouth still makes it into the cut with a swear word here and there.  It's still Avril.  Everything about this album is still her.  Only, it's different.  It's like a whole knew level.  It's mixing her young with her &#34;old.&#34;  It's just great.<br /><br />The songs flow.  The songs have meaning.  She's still inspiring.  She's still on top of her game.  To be honest, this is probably my favorite Avril album yet (I was always an Under My Skin fan -- maybe it's now a tie for favorite?).  It's just so hard to describe!  You really do need to list to the entire album before you pass judgement.  And don't just listen once and call it a day.  Listen to it again.  Let everything sink in.  Then pass judgement.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy it and I look forward to listening to it all day long.
B00DVKOYBM|2.0|I Don't mind the challenge but it gets tiring always playing people who are on a higher level and have been playing longer.  Would be better if you could choose what level player you want to challenge otherwise should always be against others of the same level
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is amazing! at first I was skeptically because of it being free but the game is awesome. the ads barely ever come out and the game is fast with no glitches that I can see. I highly recommend this app if u want a fun and challenging levels.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A sweet, sad, and ultimately life-affirming story.  I highly recommend the audio version, wonderfully read by Jim Broadbent.  Hearing the story narrated by an English voice adds to the experience of being with Harold on his extraordinary, &#34;unlikely pilgrimage&#34;.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I liked most of this cd. Some songs... not so much, but even so this girl can really sing. I can't figure out why she is not more popular here in the U.S.
140006922X|2.0|Aslan arrogantly attempts to undermine the Gospel stories with his &#34;vast knowledge&#34; of nothing because he has no references (except Josephus) to back up his arrogant remarks written as though he is the ultimate authority. His book comes across as a bald-faced attempt to steer seekers of the God of the Universe away from Christianity. One can only surmise that his motivation is to give the religion of Mohammed a higher standing by attempting to undermine the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
B000JML90Y|5.0|I really can't stand any reviews because they require 20 words which is too long. this is a great product thank you

B00F0O8SZK|1.0|Well here we are with PSyco having their Hope Diamond gem of a singer, and treating her like cubic zirconia! This is the new formula as evidenced by the onrush of Christmas CDs. Maybe if Simon would loosen up with the bucks and hire songwriters for her, we just might get a critically acclaimed CD along the lines of an Adele offering! Instead we get songs that have been covered a million times all sounding the same with ones from the past.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Gotta love Gaga... I thought this cd was superb. Every song on this 2 cd set was great. Loved it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|amazing movie, great video and audio quality (in the blu-ray)! Standard blu-ray packaging but I'm glad I got the digital copy and the DVD for the same price
B000ID37RM|5.0|I do not believe it is too far of a stretch to state that, though I saw this movie years ago on video tape, it is every bit as much a classic as it was back then.  The difference being; now it is infinitely easier to see it whenever we want to see it.  My oldest child is reading the book for high school and I had her watch the movie as well.  Though there are differences from what is in the book, there is yet another dimension given by adding the perspective of the movie as well.  Outstanding cinema.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums...it is very different and diverse...I love it ...Shady has come a long way and continues to amaze with each album...they grow and evolve like a real artist should ...Eminem will stay on top of the game all because he has what it takes and never disappoints.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Interesting and is attempting to create its own philosophical base which seems to be slowly building to a confrontation between the two main characters. I believe that the attempt to romanticize the story and make the characters into heroes is somewhat unbelievable but works in the context of the story. The attempt to create non stereotypical characters works with some and doesn't with other. It has my interest and I will continue to see how the story develops
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|Awesome CD, the first CD I got after &#34;A fever you can't sweat out&#34;, and definitely I can say PATD is BACK!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfed is a great game, me and the family really enjoy playing it. We have a competition with each other. There is nothing I would change about this game.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|Wow!  The music and photography is outstanding.  The performance really moves you and in our opinion is the best musical presentation of Les Miserables yet.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|For a movie that was in 1973, Picture and Sound was good.<br />HD could have been better. This movie is the best horror movie ever made.
B00006D295|5.0|The best musical ever, It does not matter if you are gay or not, this is a must to see!!<br />Hilarious, comic, music, everything is perfect!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really love this little guy!  I have a HD TV with a great picture but no apps. Every time we want to watch Netflix or Amazon Prime we have to drag the laptop over to the TV and balance it on the rocking chair and hope no one trips over the HDMI cables, then run to it every time we need to pause. pain in the butt! Now with the Google Chromecast we have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu (haven't tried this one yet), and YouTube always there when we want it. The unit is small, about the size of a lighter, and plugs into an HDMI port, it also needs power and comes with a wall plug or USB. My TV (like most) have some extra HDMI and a USB on the side so it makes a small loop to the HDMI and USB right next to each other, take up about the same space as a deck of cards. You can barely see it when looking at the TV and definitely nothing to trip on. Setup was very easy, You use a laptop to point it to your wireless. You then queue up what you want to watch on TV using a laptop or Android phone but it communicates straight with the wireless so the video isn't streaming through the laptop or phone. You can then use the laptop or phone to pause, put more movies in the queue, or change the volume.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game very entertaining, all the strategies you have to come up with, love that their are so many levels
1476751935|5.0|This is a must have for lovers of happiness, inspiration and motivation. It makes everyday feel like a new one.
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|The movie was good, the acting decent, and the plot kept me interested.  I don't necessarily buy the whole aliens from outer space thing and this movie did little to convince me one way or the other, but it did a nice job of illustrating how a group of people can turn against someone just because they report having an unusual experience.  The social dynamic was, perhaps, more inteesting than the UFO story.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|The film nowhere near resembles the book other than sharing the same title there are no further similarities! It really is that different. Read the book, avoid the film.
B00F35BV64|1.0|As a Star Trek fan in general, and as a rabid fan of JJ Abrams's 2009 reboot of the Trek series, I found this movie incredibly disappointing. Into Darkness is nothing more than a generic Hollywood sci-fi script, where the writers did a &#34;find and replace&#34; to shoehorn Trek people, places, and things into it. Even as a generic sci-fi thriller, it falls flat on its face. I found myself repeatedly amusing myself with web browsing and online chat because the movie was just so dull and predictable.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me these are the concessions you have to make to keep Trek in the mainstream. If that's so, it's not worth it. I've read amateur Trek fanfic that is light years better than the plot and character development of Into Darkness. If keeping Trek in the mainstream means having to pander to the lowest level of bland, cookie-cutter action, it's just not worth it. I'd rather it die in the mainstream and live on in the underground, where at least some people know what riches there are to be found in the Trek universe and ideas.<br /><br />I lay on this criticism not because every single Star Trek movie and TV show was great, flawless, and philosophically challenging. The Original Series was mostly campy garbage, and the majority of Star Trek movies were total stinkers for the same reasons Into Darkness is.<br /><br />HOWEVER, Star Trek can be and HAS BEEN significantly better than this. Just compare the Next Generation episode &#34;Inner Light&#34; to this Into Darkness thing -- it's like comparing Vivaldi to Britney Spears.<br /><br />What makes this movie so depressing is that not only have we seen much better things from Star Trek over the decades, but we've seen some of that greatness even in the previous film with the same director and the same actors. Sad, very sad.
0060926317|5.0|This book details a fantastic adventure, one that is true and more interesting than much fiction.  Read it more than once!

B008Y6SLL2|4.0|Very good movie on the 2008 financial meltdown.  Good character portrayals.  Complex issues are kept complex and not made into easy answers.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book can't help but touch your heart. So many young girls are raped at a very young age. For life the demon haunts the mind. To serve 18 years with her captors and for her and her family to come out alive. WOW. This book has made me cry. Evoked anger and in the end smile. All should read this true story from an 11 year old girl too a 30 year old woman. I wish her only happiness for the rest of her life.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|My daughter loves this case.  It puts up with all she puts it through.  Super fast shipping at a great price.

B00BHMEALA|3.0|This movie won an academy award for best picture, but after viewing it, I believe other movies nominated should have been chosen.  As far as the quality of the download, it was fine.
B009SKPVO8|5.0|So far my experience with this strap has been nothing but joy.  As a pretty new photographer, I was looking for something that would let me carry my camera with a little more ease than the stock strap, and this fits the bill.  I've been using it regularly for a few weeks now, including some pretty intense outdoor trips, and I've been nothing but happy with it.<br /><br />It allows you a full range of motion from the hip, which is invaluable.  I use it with a 400mm Canon lens and it has no problem shouldering the weight, and distributes it effectively.  The screw-in mechanism is solid, and I'm comfortable trusting my expensive camera gear to it.<br /><br />I'm very happy with it and I'm pretty glad I didn't pay $70+ dollars for the name-brand strap.  I would recommend this product.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It was a great escape.  Great conflict and tension.  It was fun and imaginative.  Thank you for consuming my life for two days.

B00F9K3Y36|4.0|As I have admitted in the past, I am a Big fan of Linkin Park and typical 90's rock. This combination of Chester Bennington teaming up with some of the members of Stone Temple Pilots may sound something out of a \\"What If?\\" Scenario but, has actually gone on to become a possibility. Chester Bennington has admitted STP were one of his inspirations in Music and must be like a dream come true for him to work along his idols. So moving on to the review, I took a listen to this and I must say it blends in pretty well, with Chester's gift of pretty much changing his \\"Angry, whiny, misunderstood\\" range to something more open to classical rock is fascinating. My favorite song on this album is \\"Same on the Inside\\" and well I gotta say it sounds awesome. Overall the album is a pretty good effort proving that an older formula can still work among the newer rock community..
0756665949|5.0|It is a wonderful book! Really beautiful, rich of information, colorful photos, high quality pages. A must-have for every fan of the Lost series. I really like this book.

B00A0SMTXS|3.0|An alright download. Sort of met expectations. One measure I use to determine movie impact is how much do I remember a few weeks later. I can remember only a little of this movie.
0756405890|5.0|This review is for everyone who can't get through the first book. Trust the many five star reviews here: it will be completely worth it.<br /><br />I didn't like this book until I'd read the second one. Pat's haughty writing style was what bothered me the most at the beginning. And he used the word \\"seemed\\" in almost every description, which felt so passive aggressive. Then, when I finally got interested in the story toward the middle, he kept going back to the present time, and I was like, \\"Darn it, who cares about Kote?? Get back to the University already!\\"<br /><br />But once I'd read the second book, I realized that every single thing about Pat's writing is a deliberate choice. Rather, each thing is a result of a thousand choices that he sweated over and probably lost a ton of sleep over. Every single word in this book, even all the \\"seemed\\"'s, is a tightly fitted puzzle piece in the story of Kvothe and his world.<br /><br />To reviewers who said this book was unnecessarily long: I've read both books many times, and neither of them is long enough! This series isn't finished yet, but it's already by far the best fantasy series I've ever read. Can't wait for Doors of Stone!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This  app lets you do alot of things with photos and videos I love it!! You can change what the photo looks like and plenty of more cool things
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I must admit, I'm not much into the Rap or Hip/Hop scene like most of my generation are. But There is something about Eminem that has made me think twice and actually give him a listen. Starting this off, and listening to this album as a whole, it blends really well. With his \\"Anger\\" issues circulating what seems to be problems in his immediate life, Eminem finds a way to transcribe that anger, into a way that we can all understand what he is feeling in this album. Roots from old-school hip-hop (Berzerk)to more softer, ballad type songs, it gives a good range of elements within it. I wasn't expecting much out of it, but I gotta admit I was completely wrong about it, I'm going to give this CD a 2nd world and maybe a lot more because it was definitely worth it!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|LOVED IT!!! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY CANT WAIT TILL the next one to come out!!! do i have to say more?!?!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addicting!  Once you start you cant stop.  The only thing annoying is being cut off for like 30 hours until your allowed to play again. That is lame.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|I have been a fan of Elton John's music and Bernie Taupin's lyrics since the 70's.  I have enjoyed each and every album of EJ's, but this album stands out as one of my newly favorite EJ albums, to me, it's up there with my other EJ favs such as Blue Moves & Rock of the Westies.  EJ went back to his roots on this album, more piano playing is heard and appreciated on this album and the lyrics are absolutely superb, very touching. Both the music and lyrics show a maturity yet at the same time it goes back to the innocense of the earlier days of their collaborations.  EJ & BT deserve a Grammy for this album, but with how the music industry is, it's unlikely that they will recognize something as magical as this album unfortunately, all a fan can do is hope for the best.  I highly recommend this album to old EJ fans, to new EJ fans and to those who might never have had an interest in EJ's music, this will for sure make you have a change of heart when it comes to EJ.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half.  It was written so well that I was  lost in it and felt like I was there.  My heart broke for Will and I can honestly understand why someone who got thrown his deck of cards made the decision he did.  I will never look at a quadriplegic's life in the same way I ever have.  I will make sure to not ever try and make them feel different, as that's what everyone  does without even knowing it.  I never realized what life changes these people go through, other than the obvious.<br />I laughed, I cried and I sobbed.  Thank you Jojo Moyes.  You've accomplished what you set out to accomplish!!!

Multiple faces, hands and she's pose-able!One thing kills it.<br />This thing is so small.<br />In the pictures the item is so detailed. Pretty face, Right colors but it's just too small to enjoy.<br />A brand new unsharpen #2 pencil is taller than this figure.<br />Why did they even go into such detail?<br />Small and dainty is how I would describe it.<br />I love Sailor Moon, but this isn't worth $40.<br />I will be returning this item.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story seemed to move too slowly at times.  And the ending was quite predictable.  But on the whole it is an entertaining book.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is fun. my niece loved to play this game and so do I.thinking about buying the full version
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love this game!  Many of the levels take several tries and the hint feature is great.  No money needed to play this game which is fantastic.
1434441636|4.0|a good read and one's personal preference of what they take away but I think there is something for everyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game challenges you. It is fun to play. My 8  year old daughter loves it.  It helps her practice her problem solving and logic.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Had funny spots and it kept the family entertained. Would not buy it but worth renting it. It had a good plot and good actors. It was kind of predictable but still entertaining.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't stop reading! It was unpredictable and smartly written. Also it evoked lots of emotion but left me satisfied, not frustrated. Very good book!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This movie was TERRIBLE.. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!<br /><br />ALL of the acting was TALENTLESS and terrible!<br /><br />Not even worth wasting any more time getting into how terrible it was!!
B00G32OER4|5.0|A solid horror movie. If you liked insidious, sinister, dark skies, paranormal activity, the exorcist, poltergeist, the possession, audition (a Japanese horror film) you may like this film. I don't think I can say anything new that hasn't been positively said about this great film.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Colorful characters fill the pages and the intertwining stories produce a cadence of rapid page turning. The narrator was wisely chosen given the time and setting of this story.  I can only say that one should just read &#34;The Book Thief&#34; and draw your own conclusions.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Title says it all.  I hate that you get so far and have to either pay (not ever gonna happen) or get Facebook friends to send you &quot;tickets&quot; which doesn't happen easily (game glitch!?)  Am ready to abandon even though I love the game.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|this movie was bad.  the acting was just flat out cheesy.  mind you, i came in watching this movie with lowered expectations since its an action flick and it was still bad to me.  the way they built up the story and ended it was really cheesy too.  so much drama for your mama for an action movie.  also, the fighting scenes between the robot and monsters are so dark you can't see the details of the cgi effects.  overall, just a lame movie.  great idea but written very poorly.  i so much wanted to like this movie.
B0055IU4GM|4.0|The distinct voice of John Hiatt shows thru with songs that tell a story.  Always worth a listen to enjoy.

B00F031X62|5.0|Hendrix fans have had to wait a long time for the official release of this May 1968 performance at Gulfstream Park, Miami: 45 years to be exact (sobering to think that had Jimi lived, he’d now be a grand old man of 71). At this event for the first time in his short meteoric career, Jimi was placed top-of-the-bill.<br /><br />So, what’s it like? Well pretty good actually, definitely not ‘scraping the barrel’ recordings but a superb concert performance delivered with finely mastered sound. This is the Experience trio – i.e. Jimi, Noel and Mitch, performing their early work with gusto, and with the mojo in overdrive.<br /><br />Highlights: almost all of it. Standout tracks are the opener ‘Hey Joe’, ‘Fire’, ‘Hear my Train A-Commin’, ‘Purple Haze’ and – especially – ‘Red House’ which might be his best-ever recorded performance of this blues number. Despite the 1968 date of the concert there is no material from the ‘Electric Ladyland’ project, but the rain-deluge in the afternoon which put a damper on the event reportedly inspired Jimi to write the song ‘Rainy Day, Dream Away’.<br /><br />You get 8x tracks from the evening headliner performance (preceded by 2 minutes of messing about and tuning up, titled ‘Introduction’) plus additional versions of ‘Fire’ and ‘Foxey Lady’ from the afternoon’s interrupted-by-rain-deluge mini-performance. The 2-gatefold cover sleeve contains a single CD, and a classy 24-page color booklet crammed with numerous rarely-seen photos of the band, around which is wrapped the text of Bob Santelli’s entertaining (if prolix) essay on the Miami pop festival and background music scene in 1968.<br /><br />For the Hendrix aficionado: don’t hesitate, buy.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Wonderful story by a master of the English Language .... amazing that this is not her mother tongue. Read this ... then Atlas Shrugged which is even more magnificent. Graeme

B00000HZTB|5.0|This is a mature work from Reed when he was forty years old (1982).....he's gone now and many young people don't understand or like his music. Hell, many older people don't either. His influence is undeniable, however.<br /><br />The main theme here is the same one that Reed explored his entire career. The desire to find a place of peace and understanding in a violent, horrifying, confusing and yet beautiful universe. The need to understand and express what he felt..... Hero worship, spirituality, alcoholism, gun violence, murder and assassination, sex and redeeming love, and Death Fear ....... charges all through this album. In other words the things that make us human, good or bad...as filtered through Reed's personality and perspective. \\"The Day John Kennedy Died\\" is to me Reed's most powerful statement concerning America and civilized life in general. That day it seemed like reality shifted forever and Reed really captures the helpless and hopeless feeling that engulfed the whole country.....a sick psychological vortex developed in our country that is ongoing today. It's mainstream now...<br /><br />Reed's guitar dueling with the great Robert Quine is really good. This unit is just right...two guitars, bass and drums. This is recorded well, remastered and if you like Lou Reed's music you should have this. When you listen to the harsh rock edge of \\"Blue Mask\\" or \\"Waves of Fear\\" you can see why Metallica wanted to work with him. Two stunning workouts that surely influenced Metallica.  When this album was recorded (82) Metallica had not released an album...yet. Maybe one day Lulu (with Metallica) will be considered a masterpiece by some people that didn't understand it when it was released. His final powerful statement. That particular album (Lulu) made me look at music in a totally new way...it was exciting.<br /><br />Really, you either get Reed or you don't......We've lost a great artist but we've got his recorded sounds and poetry to travel with us on this death bound train.....<br /> John Cale wasn't the only one that lost a \\"school yard buddy\\". So long Lou....and thanks,h bound train.....<br /> John Cale wasn't the only one that lost a \\"school yard buddy\\". So long Lou....and thanks,
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent!  All family members are really enjoying it.  Easy to use, set up is very quick, It was worth it. Recommended.
0064431789|5.0|Sometimes things just click. They work. People love them. This is one of those rare books made for children that even adults enjoy. I know there are many books like that such as The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, etc. But I'm not talking about novels, which those are. I'm talking about an illustrated book written for children that a 29 year old like me also loves. Is it nostalgia? Maybe the better question would be: Is it ONLY nostalgia? Maybe for some. For me it's just pure joy. I love this book and always will.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cool game. Needs to be a little cheaper but I'll give it five stars. Also needs more ways to earn free money and acorns. Just saying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is totally awesome. You can build many creative buildings in creative, from a coffee shop, to a pool. This has never failed to work, and so I am very glad I made this purchase. Although everything is a cube (except the cake) you can make some pretty cool stuff! If you have never played before you should play creative first. In creative you have everything, so you can have time to get used to the controls (which are very easy to use), and you have time to get to know the game. In survival you have to, well, survive. :) You have nothing and you have to collect resources and build a house so at night, the monsters don't kill you. Happy times. Happy times. If you do get killed then you lose everything you are holding, and you can get it back if you go to the place where you died. Although you have to find it quickly before everything disappears. If you are new you may want to make your home near the spawning point. I hope that if you buy this, then you have a great time with it. It is completely worth its $6.99. :)
B00CF2UORK|5.0|One of my favorite videos to stream when I want to end the day with a laugh! Brilliant, in my book!
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|Much better than I expected. Simplified the story a bit from what I remember of the book but was impressed.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I have been a Doctor Who fan since the 6th doctor.<br /><br />This series features the 9th doctor and truly the one that brought back the whole series.  Rose and the 9th doctor have a wonderful chemistry and this series starts an amazing journey.<br />My whole family watches the show (Although none are as obsess as I with it.)  My daughter is 10 and also is hooked.  Its a great show that kids can watch with their parents and you don't have to worry on what they might see.  (A few episodes might be a bit scary for some kids).<br /><br />The 9th Doctor is one of my favorite and this is a must own for any fan of the show.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|For the most part, it is a good item.  My son loves that it has the invisible ink that the light illuminates.  However, it is a little cheaper than I would have hoped.  It has held up really well so far, but it feels light and it isn't has smooth as one would like to see.  All the parts, sounds and lights work.  Getting to the battery compartment is kind of a pain, but thankfully the batteries don't need to be changed very often.  It would have been nice if it had been a bit heavier/sturdier in the hand.  However, it has stood up to my son really well thus far, which is impressive enough as he is six and he has had it for several months now.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Not much to say about DT coz they are one of my favorite progressive rock bands. Just FANTASTIC!!! Go out and buy it!!
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Awesome movie. Funny and disturbing at the same time. If you're a fan of Tom Hardy, you really get to see how versatile of an actor he is in this movie. He does an amazing job. After watching this, he became one of my all time favorite actors. And as Handsome Bob in the movie Rocknrolla. Check them both out.
1451666179|5.0|This book is mainly just a reprint of what is on her website but I am happy to buy a book from her and support her efforts, because I am a huge fan of her work.  And having it in book form allows me to shove it under the noses of friends and family who would never be convinced to go to her site.

1401923127|5.0|Dr. Lipton's book is phenomenal... takes a modern-day approach to how our mind-set has the power over our physiology on a cellular level... and yet goes beyond the mere positive thinking model which has been previously captivated on.
0385351399|4.0|As many other reviews have noted, the writing is not exactly subtle, but this book is pretty enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Stylistically, it's not unlike an Ayn Rand book -- for the sense of outrage at the utter... unreasonableness of the prevailing tides of society.  In an Ayn Rand book, the protagonist lives a pure, capitalist life, surrounded by unfair people who want to take his money.  In The Circle, the protagonist (Mae) is swept up in the vision of the company, and utterly, utterly blind to the capacity of the company as a totalitarian vehicle, as articulated by several others (notably Malden and Ty)<br /><br />What makes it interesting is the extension of seemingly helpful technology into something sinister.  Like any rigid ideology, there's nothing inherently good about \\"transparency\\", \\"social connection\\", \\"complete data\\", etc.  And of course the way in which the technology, things like ubiquitous cameras, get accepted so easily in the greater community (immediately hailed as wondrous tools for stopping child abuse, etc.) without considering the costs to freedom may seem ridiculous to most readers, but it's the same sort of path laid out by Orwell.  Instead of the protective hand of the government in time of fear and war, though, it's the allure of technology, and a faith in what can be gained from total knowledge -- of the world, of other human beings, of ourselves -- that has been granted the trust of society.  There's also plenty of Newspeak, as dreamed up by the protagonist.<br /><br />If it seems unrealistic, it seems to be in service of the right thing -- taking an ideology to it's logical extreme, which is the best way to digest an interesting thought.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|I haven't read a Batman title in many years, but I managed to jump into this trade with no problem. Snyder expands on Gotham City's mythology through a compelling mystery that managed to surprise me quite a few times. The art's great, too.

B006ATJXQW|1.0|I enjoyed the maze runner series a lot.  They were well written and interesting.  This book was dry and boring.  All the people who gave it five stars must have something wrong with them.  This book is a dull waste of money and shouldn't even call itself a prequel, it had nothing to do with the maze runner characters except maybe Teresa, and even that's not confirmed.  This is an overall waste of money.
B000VECAEO|3.0|sick of Seinfeld already, have every season but i'm getting very tired of it.  After all, I watch it every time it's on tv, so i'm not missing any part of it.  But I have it & still like Seinfeld.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|You guys, I didn’t love this book and that’s a  shame.  I actually loathed it, and that’s a freaking travesty!  I originally rated this two stars but as I sat down to write this review, I asked myself ‘what did I like about this book?’  And the only answer I came up with was ‘at least it’s over’.  I can’t give this book two stars, and it pains me that it has come to this.<br /><br />Let’s start with the dual POV.  This is becoming a popular thing, and I’m fine with it as long as it is done well and there is a reason for it.  I was actually kind of excited to hear Four’s take on things.  Or I thought I was anyway.  This reads like what not to do if you attempt dual POV.  Tris and Four ended up sounding so much alike that I would be reading along and then it would refer to something Tris did across the room and I’d be all- “wait-whaaat I thought we were Tris this chapter *flips back* oh.  We are Four, oops”.  This didn’t even just happen once or twice, it was constant.<br /><br />The character growth in this book was  non-existent.  I’d go so far as to say  some of them regressed and a few went completely crazy for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Four has always been a strong, level-headed character but after hearing some news he doesn’t like he suddenly completely ignores everything Tris says and does a bunch of stupid things without thinking twice about it.  Umm, isn’t he the one always getting on to Tris for being reckless and not thinking things through enough?<br /><br />Guess what’s outside the wall?  Swiss-cheese plot that makes no sense! I’m not a geneticist or even Bill Nye for that matter- but this is not how it works.  Did these scientists graduate from the University of Looney Tunes?<br /><br />Everybody is freaking out about the ending and I am too but not at all for the same reason.  I thought it was just ridiculous. I do not understand how what they did would even fix the issues except for temporarily.  What they did affects one place, when we learn early on this is a national issue.  This is also not how government works.<br /><br />Some of the “bad guys” are foiled with what is possibly the stupidest things I have ever heard in my entire life.  This is apparently how you change power hungry, evil people:<br /><br />A) Offer them something they gave up willingly before and seemingly never wanted to do in exchange for giving up what has been their entire life goal.<br /><br />B) Tell them they are not the boss.<br /><br />I decided to experiment with this before I condemned it as completely worthless.  So I tried these tactics out on my seven year old, my two year old, my hubby and our pack of dogs.  The seven year old listened intently then proceeded to choose to continue exactly what he was doing in the first place.  The two year old (a tiny, much prettier Napoleon really) enjoyed the ‘I’m the boss!’ ‘No, I’m the boss!’ game but ultimately continued to color the table with her markers instead of the coloring book.  The significant other blinked at me a few times then asked if I was getting enough sleep.  The dogs just tilted their heads and kept looking at eachother.  I’m no Cesar Millan but I’m pretty sure they were making fun of me.  You know what didn’t happen?  No one magically decided to do exactly what I wanted.  I now, officially, proclaim these tactics bs.<br /><br />The final crime of this book is that it was written so shoddily that I felt nothing when the big shock came.  I didn’t cry or even tear up and that was the point when I realized how much this book had killed what was previously a much beloved series.<br /><br /> I don’t know what happened to her writing between the first two books and this one, but this felt like really bad fan-fiction.  I’m glad it’s over.y did affects one place, when we learn early on this is a national issue.

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love the show, always can't wait to see what happens next-However-yes lighting is important to shows, movies etc. Yes I realize they may be in a dark basement-But-please film it with a little common sense, I mean I shouldn't have to brick up a window to keep every drop of sun out in order to SEE what's going on, so many scenes are so dark that it is very irritating to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This puzzle was the perfect mix. I can't wait till more levels are open. Not to easy or hard. 5 stars.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think that is a good idea. So some people can chat. People who can't talk to someone who is on the other side of the world.

B00BSB2AE4|4.0|This book is so incredibly cute, it’s incredicute.  Yep, I just made up a new word for it.  Err- I guess it’s actually a hybrid not really a new word…I think we’re getting off topic here.<br /><br />If you’ve ever read the Hyperbole and a Half blog then you already know what to expect from this book and it definitely delivers.  Allie has a way of bringing humor to virtually any topic.  Whether it’s the mundane act of training a new dog or the darkest throes of depression, she somehow brings out the funny.<br /><br />Her style is remarkably charming and relatable.  Even when it is focusing on topics that I don’t have much experience with firsthand, I could still identify with the way she processes it. In fact, her internal battles are some of the funniest parts.  I think everyone assumes that having an internal dialogue with yourself is somehow crazy, but we all probably do it.  Or maybe I am crazy.<br /><br />The ms paint style drawings, while admittedly simple, are quite effective.  The range of emotions she can convey in these doodles is mindblowing.  If you’re looking at them dismissively-give it a minute, they will win you over.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I have already seen many of these on the blog and was hoping for more new material. Also, it left out my absolute favorite:  How Kenny Loggins ruined Christmas.  It was my first taste of Hyperbole and a Half long, long ago and it still makes me laugh so hard I cry.  You should go read it, like now.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|There surely is a story here for the screen.  But I did not find the writing or DiCaprio here to be particularly effective in bringing it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A good way to get the weather when on the go. Easy to use and accurate. Like the weather maps and news.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|We enjoyed it very much.  The magic tricks (special effects) were awesome.  We don't even remember it being advertised when it was released.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The package was well wrapped with plastic and showed no sign of damage!!This has been on a wish list for a long time....so I know the recipient will love it!!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Ok so this cd is a roller coster of emotions kinda like when my wife was pregnant. That being said I enjoyed the variety of different flows and beats on this album. Some of the tracks are direct pick ups from the first MMLP which takes you back to that time 13 years ago, which I really love! Eminem has come full circle on this album and he has not missed a step in the lyric/flow department. If this is his last album it will be sad not to hear another Em album but I must say going out with this is the same as if Michael Jordan would have stayed retired after his last championship run with the Chicago Bulls. This is a perfect ending to a AMAZING career. Eminem faced allot of backlash, Pain and heartbreak threw the years and he came out on top. Great Eminem album and if your a fan you will not be let down.

1451666179|5.0|I've been trying to pace myself so as to not read the whole book in a day.  I allowed myself read \\"The Hot Sauce Debacle\\" last night before bed, and I seriously laughed so hard I cried.  I keep thinking of the story this morning and I break out into laughter at random.  I've been anxiously awaiting this book.  Thank you, Allie Brosh!  The one thing I will say is that I bought this book in hardcover hoping it would be more like a coffee table book.  It would be cool if they eventually craft a larger, thinner version of the book without a book jacket.  I'll probably buy that version, too! :)
B002XSP16A|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this album, especially &#34;Wild Horses&#34;.  with less background arrangements her voice really shines thru.<br />nice selection of songs.
1451666179|5.0|It is 3:56pm and I am sitting in bed. I have 100000 things that I should be doing right now. But when I checked the mail earlier, there was a package. I love getting packages so I ripped it open and there was this book. I had ordered it in a drunken haze last weekend because I was sure I had preordered it but then questioned myself (for good reason, apparently I didn't preorder it) and here it was, in my hands, just waiting to be read. So there goes my entire day. Or at least as much of the day as it takes to read this entire book. My cats keep looking at me funny when I burst out laughing, and I really need to go grocery shopping, but it is all ok because this book is amazing.<br /><br />I am not a huge reader. I used to be when I was younger and didn't have any responsibilities or todo lists with 17000 things on them. Now days I barely have time to keep up with my favorite blogs before bed. But today I am sacrificing everything to sit and read this entire masterpiece because there is simply nothing else more important than doing so.

1451666179|5.0|I've never commented on anything before. This book is covered in genuineness, full of awesome, and reeks of Pulitzer (well, maybe reeks is a bit strong. HA! See what I did there?)<br /><br />But seriously, obtain this book. Settle in with your dog/cat/spider/partner/alot/dinosaur/fish and enjoy life as seen through the Allie Brosh lens. You will come away changed. Literally. You will pee your pants and have to change.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|great series with a very large following, story line can get confusing if you have not watched from the get go but interesting, funny in some parts and excellent acting
B003ZFVI8U|5.0|love it<br />the album is like a well written book, tells a story and puts a smile on the reader/listeners face
B0021MFAFA|5.0|Far superior to the original CD release years ago.  The sound quality of the original CD was almost unlistenable. OK.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Simply fun. There is a way! Nice one hint an hour feature. You can usually find the answers if you stick with it, but hint helps at those stumped moments. Cool puzzle
B00CHS31DG|3.0|A great &#34;toy&#34; I am not sold it can identify ghosts but it does keel me entertained when I have some down time
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Love this game as well as the rest of the games in this series. However I don't enjoy having to buy each restaurant seperately.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie was released in 2006. It's an ideal movie to purchase from Amazon,as it stands repeated viewing, and it has a timeless quality which means that it has retained its freshness since release.<br /><br />Also, I have lent my DVD to several friends, who have enjoyed the experience of watching it.<br /><br />It's a clever movie, a deceptively simple tale, with several layers of intrigue and irony.<br /><br />Nolan demonstrates yet again that he is a master director, and the performances from the cast are uniformly excellent.<br /><br />David Bowie makes a cameo appearance as Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />This movie does have a complex storyline, and it does require concentration. But, like a fine wine, it opens up to be enjoyed!<br /><br />Well worth watching!
B000THCKHU|5.0|I purchased this album for the title song- a colorful glimpse into rural life in Britain a century ago. Or last week... If you like Ian Anderson, you'll also appreciate the rest of the album too. It's a nice flow- well-written songs arranged for marvelous acoustic guitar by Anderson and powerful electric guitar by Martin Barre.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|love it, just needs more compatible apps on android and ios. I've enjoyed having it and you cant beat the price
B009X01C64|5.0|Just received the Marware Revolve case in black and love it!  Its polycarbonate and microfiber shell wraps around the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" which holds the device securely in place, and the high-quality genuine leather exterior adds a touch of class. The interior shell rotates so you can utilize the Kindle in either a horizontal or vertical position, and allows for three hands-free viewing angles.  Just rotate the Kindle 180 degrees and you can access the HDMI and charging ports without removing the device from the case. Another great feature is the Resolve's automatic sleep/wake lid.<br /><br />Visit the manufacturers web site gomarblue.com for additional details on the Revolve case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".  You'll be very glad you did! Its in stock there at a fantastic price.  ;)
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game and its fun but i dont like that you have to pay for things as you play.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a great game with tough but fun levels. It has quickly become one of my favorites. My son likes it too.
B0057R5G6E|4.0|Perfect. Came faster than expexted and was more than could of hoped for. The figures look perfect and is a must have for any Jurassic Park lover.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This is great game and great review guys and has great post and great people in it keep up the good work
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|You know, I love the Arcade Fire and I want to like the disk more, but I don't.<br /><br />I'll leave it for the hipsters (or whomever) to decipher the Kierkegaard and the Orpheus and Eurydice overtones / references.  Or you can pick up at least two of Win Butler's questions of  'not knowing what is heaven for' and try to draw a line through the album for meaning.<br /><br />I just want better than decent music.  And it is decent, but I'm not convinced it is better than decent.<br /><br />For a band where excess doesn't seem to be enough, and that is a model that has worked for them in the studio and in live performances, they may have found a limit to their own experimentation. Some of their innovation gets in their way.<br /><br />Of course there are parts and songs of Reflekor that I like, but overall as a two disk, 13 track release, it's not truly moving me. Sure, additional time and multiple listens might change that to a degree, but normally I have a good sense for what works for me and what does not.<br /><br />I totally dig the title track. It took a few listens, but the vibe that is more Nile Rodgers in his Bowie / Duran Duran-era production days than it is James Murphy's LCD Soundsystem.  But it works.  If only more of the album could have been in this vein.<br /><br />Reviews will tell you this is a \\"dance album\\". It is not. Nor would I want it really to be.  Could you dance to some of it?  Sure.  But just because Murphy is a producer, and there are few more electronics included, doesn't make it a disco / dance record.<br /><br />Now, I think a good minute could have been trimmed from the title song, and from a few other songs that are on the full disk.<br /><br />For what works, you know I like the title track. \\"Joan of Arc\\" totally works. It's got a good arrangement both musically and vocally.  \\"Normal People\\" actually shows that Arcade Fire can still be a rock outfit.<br /><br />What does not work?  \\"Flashbulb Eyes\\". The electronic reggae-like beats aren't horribly conducive to a good listening.  I'm not sure I enjoy the \\"Billie Jean\\" bass beat in \\"We Exist\\".  \\"You Already Know\\" starts with Big Audio Dynamite-ish feel to it, and contains a most likely Haitian feeling that works slightly more than it did on \\"We Exist\\".<br /><br />The bigger problem with \\"You Already Know\\" is the repeating of lyrics over and over and over. That might work for Murphy's LCD group and dance music in general, but it's not playing well with Arcade Fire.  This happens again in<br /><br />I shouldn't be too rude, is it coincidence that \\"Awful Sound\\" was on for over four minutes before I snapped back into not having it as background music and realizing the song title was apropos. Elements of George Harrison that are good, but not enough to save the song.<br /><br />As for \\"Here Comes the Night\\" drags on for me. With changes in the music itself, it could be three different songs tied together. ...and that doesn't even include \\"Here Comes the Night II\\", which is total throwaway track.<br /><br />Any song that is 11+ minutes long just becomes excessive for the artist's ego and usually leaves little satisfaction to the listener. \\"Supersymmetry\\" is no exception. Of course, there is a pause in the music and the last half (?) sounds like a hidden track played backwards, because THOSE have always worked so well for other artists {yes, sarcasm}<br /><br />Then there is the parts of the disk that I'm on the fence about:  \\"Afterlife\\" sounded so much better live on the YouTubeMusicAwards. So I'm not so sure the music is the problem as much as the production. And that might be true of most of the album.<br /><br />\\"Porno\\" I kind of dig.  But it's one of those songs you have to be in the mood for.  It's definitely more electronic and dance-oriented than most of the other disk.  The \\"bass\\" line is all too familiar, but it works.<br /><br />Overall, I think much of the music has potential as long as musical and production grandstanding doesn't get in theway - but it has crept in.  It will be interesting to see what they do with this in a live setting.  Since \\"Afterlife\\" wasn't drastically altered live, it shows there is much promise for the songs - but I'm not finding it in this release.way - but it has crept in.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|This was a decent quick read. I enjoyed the lead character! The story is somewhat predictable but there is nothing wrong with that:)
0375842209|5.0|This book has obviously taken the world by storm. I understand why. You just can't stop reading once you start!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Wonderful,funny,family oriented, and lots of action.  Full of laughter The best on screen couple so far. When's the next season coming.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great thriller - could not put down. Baldacci is great. Can't wait to start the next in the series. I also enjoyed the TV series inspired by the book.
B00F8KIJ2I|3.0|Thanks a lot Avril. I can't help it that I'm fat and like smarties. You're probably not perfect either. I mean, just look at your new album...<br /><br />Ha ha, just kidding.<br /><br />Rock n Roll - One of the best tracks. Good rocker but lame guitar solo.<br />Here's to never growing up - nice catchy versus - bridge is ok, chrous is lame.<br />17 - One of the better songs on the album - Catchy, good versus, bridge and chrous.<br />Bitchin Summer - Versus - nope, Bridge is catchy, chorus is lame. Rap? 3/4 of the way through. Please!<br />Let me go - eh, just not a very good song, sorry.<br />Give you what you like - eh, so so.<br />Bad Girl - TERRIBLE<br />Hello Kitty - eh, it's unique. I like this one ok.<br />You ain't seen nothing yet - Good versus - Bridge is ok - Chorus is lame.<br />Sippin on Sunshine - Good bouncy versus - Bridge is ok - Chorus, once again, is lame.<br />Hello Heartache - Nice try, but nope. Boring.<br />Falling Fast - Better than Hello Heartache, but still, nothing special about this song.<br />Hush Hush - Boring.<br /><br />Best songs are: Rock n Roll, 17, Bitchin Summer, You ain't seen nothing yet, Sippin on Sunshine.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I think it was an okay book the only thing that I thought is wrong with it is that it is hard to understand so I had ally of trouble writing a book report:-(
B000X2H8G4|5.0|works great ....used on a parabolic dish .....to make a parabolic mic system .......you can hear birds etc. that are 300 ft. away just like they are sitting beside you.......it also works great in a room for tv ....i tuned it down to the point of not being able to here the word.....turned on the mic and coud here it well ....I was 18 ft. from tv.
1444737112|5.0|This book is very touching.  I am a sucker for animal stories anyway, and cats in particular, but this is a story of how a cat helped a recovering addict get his life back together.  I suppose it could have been a dog, or a parrot, or a snake, but it was Bob...and what a wonderful cat he is !
B006PE6VW6|5.0|I mean, I'm not giving it five stars because it's Casablanca here, folks, but for a rom-com it worked for me. I thought the chemistry between the two leads (Johnny Torch and House Bunny) was believable. The story was wacky enough to be maximized for laughs. I loved the whole \\"young\\" Boston setting and vibe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this app is so addicting I love it. the only thing I hate is that you only get 5 lives and a limited amount of moves but that's what make the app so additive. if your thinking about getting this app I would GET IT!!!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Good Characters. Nice story. Left me wishing it was a little longer to flush out more of the possible story lines. Makes me think about reading the books.
B00A7Z8KAU|3.0|It is somewhat difficult to use, as I am not an artist, but would be great for those who have a gift for drawing.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Brief history: My first Stryper album was To Hell With The Devil. Afterwards I went and bought Soldiers Under Command and The Yellow and Black Attack. Whenever they released an album after I bought it. In God We Trust was great. Against The Law is still  one of my favorite albums of all time! I got the various live and greatest hits albums. When Reborn was released I quickly picked it up. It was ok, but I don't listen to it much. Murder By Pride moved closer to the greatness achieved on the earlier releases, but not quite there. The Covering was cool. Second Coming was refreshing because I love those classic songs and they redid them perfectly. Now we have No More Hell To Pay, what should I say.... AWESOME!!!! Stryper has released a disc I have been craving for since Against The Law. I won't break down track to track because they all are GREAT! If you love Stryper, Christian rock, rock, or just music in general, BUY THIS! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. IT ROCKS YOUR MIND, HEART, and SOUL!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|really love the endless fun you can have with this game. cant wait for new levels and vehicles. keep up the good work.
006202406X|1.0|I LOVED the first two books and almost didn't read this one based on family member's reviews. I wish I hadn't. The ending is ridiculously stupid. I will NOT be attending the movies or recommending this series to anyone. I did NOT enjoy this book at all!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chrome cast is the best thing that has happened to TV today! I can play whatever I want on my tablet/laptop and project in on my HD TV - be it advertisements, movie trailors, songs or my favourite movies! I highly, highly, recommend it! Worth every penny!!
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I gave this movie three stars because its not a bad movie, but I think it could've been better. When you make a sequel it has to be better or just as good as the last movie. Bane should not have been the only bad guy in this movie. There wasn't enough Batman and Catwoman's role was just too minor. Her outfit sucked and they didn't say Catwoman at all in this movie. I wanted to see Harley Quinn in this movie too. Its not a . movie, but its not an epic conclusion either. I wanted to see Jaimy Pressly play Harley Quinn and Cat Woman could have battled her as well as Maranda Tate.<br /><br />. They could've fit Johnny Depp as the Riddler too and just change the whole story line. Though Bane is a good character, he is not well known to me. had it not been for this movie I would not have known who he was. I didn't like all of the physical ailments the doctor read out to Bruce Wayne. he didn't seem like a super hero to me then.
1400052181|5.0|excellent real-life story about medical research and its unethical practice in utilizing cancer cells from a young woman without her family's knowledge nor consent; and the ramifications / impact on that family not to mention the profiteering in the name of medical research
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It sets the tone for the whole day if you wake up music you like:. I sleep through even the loudest alarm if it is a repetitive sound, but music wakes me right up. This is a very easy app to use, and has made a huge difference in my sleep patterns!
0525478817|5.0|The book The Fault in Our Stars by John Green has left a lasting impression on me, and is probably going to be one of my favorite books for a long time.  The book is about a girl with cancer, but the story isn't about cancer.  The fact that the main character, Hazel, has cancer was a big part of the story but it wasn't what the book was all about, there was more to it than that.  The Fault in Our Stars was about life, the way it is, without any sugarcoating or fantasy endings, and the fact that \\"the world isn't a wish granting factory.\\"  The writing was understandable and relatable somehow even though it told the story of something I have never experienced.  John Green did and amazing job at telling the story from a teenage girl's point of view on the world. I read this whole book in one day because I just couldn't put it down.  The characters were especially real and I found myself getting connected to them as if I really knew them.  My favorite character was Augustus.  He was charming and witty and I felt he brought up a big theme in the book about being remembered.  Gus wanted to die having done something great and feared the idea of being gone one day without his life having any meaning.  Maybe instead of trying so hard to do something heroic, Gus should have focused on what he's already done.  What Gus didn't realize was that even if you don't leave behind a huge legacy or impact the whole world, to a few people, your life and death is meaningful enough to change their entire world.<br />Despite the bleak outlook and the desperation that is there throughout the book, there were also times when I laughed out loud.  Hazel has an amazing outlook on life, and it is inspiring to see how even though she has terminal cancer she doesn't let that take over her life.  She's \\"living with cancer not dying of it\\" and doesn't allow herself any time for self-pity.  I also cried while reading this book, probably more than I have from a book ever before.  The ending was so ironic, as the whole time you were expecting Hazel to die, but then the exact opposite happens and it broke my heart and left me speechless.<br />The Fault In Our Stars is a \\"cancer book.\\" It's a heartbreaking love story.  But it's also a story about finding your own identity and figuring out your place, gaining everything, and losing everything.  The Fault in Our Stars is about love, even when love seems impossible, and about finding your own infinities, even if life is painfully too short.ic, as the whole time you were expecting Hazel to die, but then the exact opposite happens and it broke my heart and left me speechless.<br />The Fault In Our Stars is a \\"cancer book.\\" It's a heartbreaking love story.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this app for fun, since I love Despicable Me. But after playing this game for a period of time, my tablet froze. When I tried to press the home button, the screen began to turn white. When I turned my tablet off and back on, my date was reset back to January of 1970. This happened multiple times before I gave in and uninstalled the app. Maybe it's just my tablet, but if this hadn't happened, I would give this game 4 or 5 stars.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|When I saw this game I thought hey, &quot;I bet that game sucks&quot; you know clearly judging the book by its cover, being a blind idiot and an optimist. Anyways I saw the REVIEWS. Mind. Blown. There were some reviews that would say &quot;WARNING DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE&quot;, or &quot;this game is fun and very entertaining to play, has the same Facebook idea so you won't pass the game easily, you use 1 energy per game, and you have 10 or 9 energy in total and you use 2 for a specific animal to hunt.&quot; And I have to say this is one of the best games ever I've played in a long time. And I have to say these reviews are correct this is addictive, very addictive.
B00GBQI0M2|5.0|a very short novella, took mere minutes to read...but thats not going against it!<br /><br />A great teaser, i really want to find out more about what happens to Marea and of course the vamp who made her!<br /><br />Leaves you wanting to read the series, which as yet hasnt been released, but im keeping a watch for it!<br /><br />good quick read, cannot fault it!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Nice program (App), that works, at your direction, to clean memory and eliminate unusual files from memory. A really great app. I would recommend this app to a friend.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This is one of the only new albums I own on vinyl.  I heard her do a few songs from this album on a tv show... I loved the sound and sampled the rest online and decided to buy it.  Listening to this on vinyl has to be the only way.  It's amazing and just takes you to another place.  I never get tired of listening to it.  Just looked it up again to buy as gifts for others this Christmas!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very cool game for those who like to hunt. It's a cool experience for people that want to see how to hunt
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Avril Lavigne is such an amazing artist. I had very high expectations for this album, and the album met them. It's mature and absolutely amazing. The vocals are great, and the album is just put together very well. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Better have good internet connection.  Flakes out sometimes when using iPhone or iPad devices.  However, that could be a cause of internet issues just figured out we had from high-speed provider.  I will say that it kinda stinks that you cant stream anything you want to the device.  You are restricted to YouTube, Hulu and anything from your browser.  The took away the ability to stream without hacking the thing to death local files.  That sucks........It would be so easy for Google to let that feature work as I believe they would have a difficult time keeping them in stock.  I own 5 of them and give them to clients etc.....
B00G32TD98|4.0|Edge of your seat the entire move, very well done, super creepy and many check your shorts moments.  Your woman will definitely not let you go the entire film!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Overall this game is quite a bit of fun. Gameplay is easy enough to figure out. There are just a few annoying popups here and there that are bothersome on a paid app, but nothing too drastic.<br /><br />I do recommend this game though, for one particular reason: It can be played with another person simultaneously!!  I work with kids at the school and both the student and I can send our  missiles to defend our city. This is a lot of fun and teaches the principle of teamwork. That right there is what makes this game easily worth a dollar.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Not sure why this comment is so challenging on my kindle keyboard. For some reason i cannot add to the end of this comment so i am adding to the beginning. Maybe a little bloody for the preteen crowd, but This game is built really well. This game has Great graphics. The hunts can be pretty Intense
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|I only recently became aware of Jason Fried's writing and his company 37Signals.com, but instantly fell in love with his clear, concise, no-bull, crystal-clear communication style. After reading some of his articles in Inc. magazine, I found the 37Signals blog and instantly bought the book REWORK and felt invigorated by it. Finally, here is someone who understands that securing venture capital funding is not necessarily the key to success nor to a happy, fulfilling life. He simply makes products (the online software Basecamp, Highrise, etc.) that are amazingly simple to use, and therefore valuable and in demand because they save people time and money. The previous book, REWORK basically throws everything you were taught about business out the door and gets back to basics focused on what will work today, in today's world that changes daily. Ridiculous concepts such as five-year business plans are ridiculed and dismissed, and Jason restores sanity to business ideas and concepts. With REMOTE, he applies the real-world experience of running a distributed company and explains the biggest advantages to hiring remote teams. My two favorite facts about remote working that the book explains: Reason #1: Hiring remote employees allows companies to hire the best talent in the world instead of being handcuffed to only the best talent living in a tiny geographical area. Reason #2: Offices are what the authors call &#34;interruption factories&#34; in which anyone can walk into your cubicle or office uninvited and interrupt your work many times throughout the day. Working remotely allows you to get into the zone and focus on the things that make you productive without the productivity-killing environments of the interruption factories. REMOTE lists the most common excuses that bosses often use to dismiss the idea of remote work, and then the authors proceed to blow every one of those excuses right out of the water with common-sense-filled nuclear missiles. The book refutes those common misperceptions about remote work humorously sometimes, but with factual, common-sense reasons why visionary leaders will actually choose to embrace remote work in the very near future if they want to keep up with their more innovative competitors who keep hiring the most talented people in the world right out from under their noses. The remote revolution has already begun. The visionaries were the first to jump on board. This book will sway anyone on the fence toward the huge benefits of remote teams, and those who refuse to read this book will simply get left behind in the dust of their smarter competitors. If you've never worked remotely and have been trapped commuting to an office, this book will set you free. Also, if you have not already read Scott Berkun's book The Year Without Pants, you should read that too. It's a perfect companion piece to REMOTE, and tells the story of Scott's year working as a member of a distributed team at Automattic, the distributed company behind Wordpress.com.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love this book and the series, they are the best books I have ever read,but THE DIDDLY-DARN END!! Ugh!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am without reservation, totally addicted to this series.  I can truthfully admit that I have never been so attached to any television program in my adult life.  The characters only grow more nuanced and multi-dimensional with every show.  Kudos to the director and producers, and thank you Masterpiece Theater!!!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Needed a good editor.  Way too much carrying on about being high on whatever.  Strong characters, lovely plot, but too long.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing! I loved it. It has many twists and turns. I would recommend this book to any one who likes Rick Riordan books. I would recommend it 5 out of 5 stars.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The Shining is one of two books I've read (and I'm an avid reader) that scared me enough to require finishing with every light on and my back to a wall so nothing could sneak up on me from behind. From start to finish The Shining cast a spell. It created an atmosphere of terror which was inescapable, even during chapters when nothing overtly terrifying happened. As entertaining and suspenseful as Doctor Sleep is, it didn't produce anything like that level of spine-tingling, sustained and delicious fright. It is a good read and has glowing moments. I enjoyed learning what happened to Danny, Wendy and Dick and appreciated the glimpses of others who &#34;shine&#34;. A female protagonist is welcome, too. I wanted the end to be more nuanced than I found it to be, which was a disappointment. I do appreciate the metaphor of &#34;taking steam&#34; and its many parallels in our lives. From whom do we take energy? Is it an exchange? Or is one person weakened by the experience? Are there real-life vampires? A worthwhile read, though IMO not equal to the original.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Needs to fix issues on the m points because a video keeps popping up when im trying to do something else
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have been using evernote for years now. I have a vast amount of notes from college, old family recipes, and list of things I need to get.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game, but some instructions are not clear.  Friends give me extra moves but I don't know where they go when I accept and how can I use them?  Game only lets me buy moves.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Huge bang for your buck with this, right now I have access to YouTube and Netflix and very easy to use. Great for people who aren't technically inclined.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love minecraft! It's the best game EVER! But my son wants you to add all this: Caves,Villages with villagers,Dungeons,Jungle Biomes,Ravines,Swamps,Wolves that can be tamed,Jungle Temples if you add Jungles,Endermen,Ocelots if you add Jungles,Make Redstone mineable,Make different wood planks look like they have different colors,Make Creative mode have animals,minecarts,minecart rails &amp; powered rails,Redstone torches if you add Redstone,Boats,Emeralds way down underground,lapis lazuli,Remove Herobrine, make it kinda like the PC version,And possibly add The End. And the the Nether. Please? In the next update? And believe me. It's worth the money.
B002HIFM3S|4.0|Oberson's &#34;You Got It&#34; is NOT included in this one. Unlike another edition that was issued on cassette tape. Rats!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I appreciated the author's honesty and vivid descriptions.  Kept waiting for something dramatic to happen, but, like real life, often not much does.  I do recommend it.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Stryper hit this one Out of the Park! The guitars are crunchy and tight on NMHTP -they have really dialed in the Stryper Tone on this one... The vocals have never sounded better: Michaels Sweets voice has matured in a very good way, as has the style and performances of each bandmate. There is something for everyone on NMHTP - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00E8S2GJI|1.0|First they stretch the book over three movies, which of course requires them to put all sorts of extra garbage into the story, and now they continue the fine tradition or trying to get those that like the movies to buy as many versions as humanly possible to squeeze ever last dollar possible from Hobbit/LOTR fans.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read all three!  Loved the story and am looking forward to seeing it on the big screen!  Good job making you feel as if you are apart of the story!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I cried at the end of this book. Cried because I've read THE SHINING and I fell in love with Danny, the little boy who stood brave in the face of death, and because in DOCTOR SLEEP Danny, all grown up now, faces death again, only deeper this time, as a hospice worker who helps the dying go to sleep. There is something humbling and tear-jerking in this book, as opposed to its predecessor. People change, authors change, stories change. This one is a sequel that can stand on its own, because it's a story about a character from the previous book, yet its an entirely new story, and that's how it should be. But the old-time ever-present King elements prevail. The fight of addiction. The wheel of time. The terrible monsters that feed on the pain of the others. The strong women characters (this one of the reasons I come back to King's novels again and again). The toy trains, the shabby in-the-middle-of-nowhere American cities sprawled along the plains of states that you can't immediately locate on the map. And eerie landscapes, simple things that can hold horror inside them, just like they do in real life. If nobody thinks there is an elephant in the room, nobody can see him, but he's there all right, and he's there all right in DOCTOR SLEEP.<br /><br />A few scenes of the ghosts from Overlook hotel that return to haunt Danny, and we fast forward to Danny, Dan now, in his forties, drifting from town to town, drinking, and eventually settling in New Hampshire, joining AA, and scoring a job in a hospice, helping people \\"sleep\\" with his \\"shining\\", each death predicted by an ambling cat Azzie who makes his way into patients' rooms just when it's time for them to pass on. But not everything is nice and dandy for Dan. He's got some ghosts of his own to hide in the closet, he's flooded with nightmares, and he gets contacted by a girl, another \\"shiner\\", by the name of Abra. The girl has seen something, something terrible that she can't quite comprehend, and that is a senseless murder. A murder of a boy. By whom? Why? For what? And what does the top hat has to do with it? And the site of the Overlook hotel? And those quiet RV's that you see cruising along America's turnpikes that hold no more than elderly couples whiling away their retirements? Or do they? You don't know where evil lurks, and it lurks in most unlikely places sometimes, hiding behind most unlikely faces. Life is a wheel. Everything comes back to where it started. Dan must go back to his childhood, to see what the future holds, if he has any future. Losing his life is not what bothers him, he has faced death before. It's Abra who he's worried about now, and it's Abra who can die, if he doesn't help her.<br /><br />I can never have enough of King. Don't know what it is. His way of putting words together, his quiet build-up of horror, his images, or what. I only know that it strikes something hidden inside me, and I gotta go now read and reread his big scary books, like SALEM'S LOT, and IT, and PET SEMATARY. And if you haven't read THE SHINING, go read it, and then go read DOCTOR SLEEP. See you on the other side.er. A murder of a boy. By whom? Why? For what? And what does the top hat has to do with it?

B00280LYHS|5.0|This was the best book series that I have ever read in my life. It was just so good I just could not stop reading.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like it .it is very fun and enjoyable . helps on the. rainy days when I am playing. ha ha
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it gives you so many games to play you will never get bored. I love it so very very much
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is great but I have been waiting for a new mutation for a very long time when are you guys coming out with a new mutation?
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was enthralled with the depth of the characters and situations. Orson Scott Card demonstrates a remarkable understanding of different personality types, how they are motivated, and how they interact with each other. The author has given this knowledge to his character, Ender. The character takes this understanding and adds his blend of genius and compassion. The story in the forefront is exciting alone, but the more subtle story line involving Valentine and Peter adds an intriguing dimension. The two stories are perfectly balanced and create an ending that was cathartic, but not predictable. I loved every minute spent reading Ender’s Game!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Terrific book. Excellent account and history of a region unfamiliar to many. A remarkably talented and passionate young woman writes with true and sensitive compassion for all human beings.
140123755X|5.0|I had never read a comic/graphic novel before this, and now I am hooked on them!<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy or a nerd in any way, this is great read! The theme's can sometimes be rather adult. Nothing too explicit, but it's not a comic for young children.<br /><br />Be warned: you will be addicted and forced to buy many more issues.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! This series is great with each book continuing the suspense and making them difficult to put down.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|Very disappointing book in so many ways.  First it is written in a pop-magazine style.  Apparently referring to movie star examples is suppose to help make her points more substantial.  It doesn't.  This just cheapens the already flimsy ideas purposed in the experiments. Secondly, the author mentions how she is a struggling writer who often sends out her resume to get extra writing work.  That is a blatant contradiction to one of her initial claims that she is a millionaire.  Lastly, these games are simply an attempt to shift one's perspective on situations than to actually manifest anything different.<br /><br />The most disappointing part is that she actually has endorsements for her book by established authors.  Makes me question their integrity when they endorse such a frivolous work.<br /><br />Glad I did not pay full price for this.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Its fashionable for small minded, no-life-having bafoons to hate on Kanye, they do this for innumerable reasons, most of which stem from their dearth of imagination, too much spare time and insecurity/fears/resentment. If people dont find this album to their taste, that is fine but if they deny its originality, its exceptional production quality and raw honesty you will know they do so because they have been caught up in the current trend of thinking you know celebrities - when you actually dont - and forming an opinion about them as people; either vitriolically opposed to them or sycophantically enchanted with them. Get a grip people, you have no place hating someone you only hear snippets from in the media, listen to this album with open ears and enjoy its originality....the end.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I really enjoyed the game and was having fun until I had to pay more. If I had known at the beginning it was not free<br />I would not have downloaded it. I have removed from my device and will not purchase any more.<br />Please let people know up front the cost. Don't say free and then charge to continue. It is either free or not!!!
1444710338|5.0|The book was in super condition, especially for the cost 0.71 cents!! No ripped pages, not all bent and creased.  Very nice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for whiling away the time. Fun solitaire. Don't have any more to add. It's a fun solitaire game for my Kindle.
B005MRXS78|5.0|I tried in out in the living room with my backup camera.  I need to provide a magnetic base for the backup camera.  I intend to use it to hitch the trailer to the camper and back up the trailer.  I need to be able to move the camera for the different operations.  Looking straight down at the hitch for coupling and then raising and panning to back the trailer into its spot.  I think the remote sensor is long enough where I can point the remote control and accomplish the tasks.  I was expecting a wireless RF remote that does not need line of sight.  However this is invisible light so I have to point the remote at the remote sensor.  It is battery operated.  I may need to find an auto charger for it.  I know it is not water proof so all not be using it for down the road.  So I'm really happy so far just need to find camera screw base that is magnetic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that I'm finally able to play Candy Crush Saga on Kindle Fire HD. Time to do a happy dance&hellip; :)
B0051T47NQ|5.0|Awesome movie. Really funny and great storyline. I think anyone who likes a good fantasy will enjoy this film which has surprises from beginning to end
0486278077|5.0|Book was perfect! My teen wanted to read some more classic literature so I introduced her to this, among others. She loved the book and I'll be suggesting more.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I gave the book 4 stars. My only regret is that in true YA novels fashion it ends quite abruptly. I do love this serious and am so grateful for it because this book started my son's passion for reading 3 years ago and has taken him from an insecure, slow dyslexic reader to an accomplished novel reader that surpasses his reading time and comprehension. Thank you Suzanne Collins.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is a must read! If I say too much it will spoil it.<br />It's changed me in all the ways only an amazing author and story can.<br />I will strive to Be Brave...Thank you.
1607744104|5.0|excellent book packed full of information on CP's and everything about them..... photo's are of exceptional quality and the book is written with a little humor which makes it not so dry......
B001NLKXK2|5.0|For anyone dealing with Alzheimer's in any way, this is a very vivid portrait. Alice's voice is so authentic that I felt as though I were there with her. The author has obviously heard many life stories from early onset patients who can describe what is happening to them. It was a difficult read for me because it is so heartbreaking. Lisa Genova also accurately portrays the very difficult choices every family has to make when dealing with this disease without making them right or wrong.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|this game is a lot of fun but can be difficult.  great way to pass the time. also works well on the kindle fire. great FB game.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|This was better than the other two movies, a lot of action that kept you thinking, YOU will enjoy this as much as I did!
0765356147|5.0|I loved this book!  A friend recommended I read Sanderson after I said I was getting a bit bored with some of my favorite fantasy authors.  The Mistborn trilogy was the first of his books I've read and I'm completely impressed.  I didn't like The Well of Ascension as much as The Final Empire and hoped that was just because he was saving everything for the the end. The resolution of the trilogy was completely satisfying.  All of the questions were resolved and not only did it focus on the main characters, side characters like Spook were expanded and new characters were introduced.  This is a novel that made me really excited about the genre again and I definitely recommend it.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|So well written, this book has left me in tears yet strangely satisfied. The heart-wrenching ending could not have  gone any other way. Beautiful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Each level is more creative and fun than the previous. Once you start it's very difficult to stop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the the  concept of the game. You need to use strategic moves to concur the levels. I also like having to wait for lives to play because otherwise I would seriously play all day!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great but only YouTube works where I live. Just hope Google adds more apps support. I love this thing.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is hands down one of my favorite books I have read this year.  I could not put it down! Canyons that has interest in science should read this book!
B00002SWEM|5.0|The story is a classic, and quite interesting and amzing music, The Buena Vsita Social Club is by far our family favor..
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a great read. I read it years ago and was just as captivated the second time around.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|This game is a fun problem solving game. Currently, there are 75 levels, I wish there was more, since I've only had it for two days, and I'm already on the third set. Don't know that I would pay $0.99, Itwas the free app of the day for me<br /><br />Love it!
B00BWQW73E|2.0|Jeff Bezos ls MARRIED?<br /><br />REALLY?<br /><br />No, seriously, he has a wife?<br /><br />That's the most startling thing that could come from this book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my children and I enjoy hours of fun with this game I would recommend it to everyone especially to people that have young children.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|One of the things I love about Celine Dion is the fact that, although she has proven to the world that she is a magnificent powerhouse vocalist, she still manages to find ways to push the envelope with her music.<br /><br />In this newest album, \\"Loved Me Back to Life,\\" she allows herself to toy with her voice. In the title track, we experience a delicious new vibrato similar to Sia's, who also penned the song. We also get raw, unpolished notes in \\"Water and a Flame,\\" a cover of Daniel Merriweather's hit song with Adele, and \\"Didn't Know Love\\" that bring more truth to the words found within the song. My favorite Celine moments come when she whispers in ballads and we get some major whisper moments which I die for.<br />We also get some covers on this album: Janis Ian's \\"At Seventeen,\\" Billy Joel's \\"Lulluby\\" (both of which she covers in her Vegas spectacle `Celine'), \\"Overjoyed,\\" in which she duets with Stevie Wonder, and the aforementioned \\"Water and a Flame.\\"<br />Not shying away from the uptempo pop songs, Celine shows that she shouldn't be underestimated in the current pop world as she can give the majority of today's pop startlets a run for their money with groovy tracks like \\"Save Your Soul\\" and \\"Somebody Loves Somebody.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this newest work by pop superstar Celine Dion proves that she has solidified her spot in pop culture. She is in a place in her career where she can afford to have artistic liberty with new projects, and no matter how out-of-left-field her song selections may be, they fit perfectly within her repertoire, further proving that the woman can do no wrong with the voice she has.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A beautifully written book...Zusak has such a gift of words. Not a casual pick up, put down book...stay with it...you will be rewarded. Joy, tenderness, heartache, compassion and sorrow...
B00EHMG358|5.0|The story gabs your attention right away and never let's go.  Interesting characters. Preston and Child's at their very best
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Despite some disturbing content, I couldn't put this book down! A great read with a surprise ending. Enjoyed Sharp Objects just as much as Gone Girl!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|First, I bought this book for another place, sorry Amazon.  I will be buying a lot of Christmas presents from you.  That said, I love this book!<br /><br />That said, I read the two reviews who complained about having her old blogs in the book.  That is true.  However, if they read what she said about the book a year or so before she published it, she mentioned she was going to do that already.  Yes, there is a lot of recycled material.  However, as fans of hers it is nice to have those stories with us, not chained to the internet.  Enjoy the freedom!<br /><br />The new stories are amazing and even makes me want to do something similar.  That is the great thing about this book, even Allie, for those who need to express ourselves, even to ourselves, she offers a happy medium in which we are able to do so.  Not only that, her childish pictures (which yes she puts a lot of hard work into them) shows us that we don't need to be artists to express ourselves, we just need to be honest with ourselves.  The book does something for you other than entertain you!<br /><br />I would recommend this book for everyone (well, maybe not children, she does cuss a little).  If you are a happy person, you will be happier.  If you hate dogs, you will agree with her frustrations.  If you love dogs, you will laugh as she tries to help.  If you are suffering from depression, you will have a voice from the dark to help you understand it.  If you have never dealt with depression, you can understand your friends that do.  If you need a good laugh, you will get it.  I need to stop talking about how cool this book is.  Buy the book already!  Take out your card and give your money to Allie / Amazon.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|20 more words are required before I'm able to submit this review and oops now there's only like three left yay! Enjoy book ...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  So happy I  an play on my kindle.  Great having family and .<br />friends to help.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I love Andrew Lloyd Weber music and this goes to my collection. Well acted and sounds great. One for musical collectors!
B00E6F155E|5.0|BUY THIS NOW...I have never seen this concert movie until today. The only video I have seen from anywhere near this era is his \\"Secret World\\". I love the SW concert video. It has a mystical quality and is actually enhanced by it's grainy visual quality. So now viewing this other concert is a totally new way of seeing him from that era. The picture here is PRISTINE! I can't believe the quality. The sound is immaculate (although I understand overdubbed in some places). The closest I can approximate this film is to Johnathan Demme's Talking Heads concert \\"Stop Making Sense\\". It is THAT good. It comes close to the intensity of SMS in that the camera prowls the stark and bare stage as Peter gives a WOW performance. High point of this is definitely when he body surfs the crowd on \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\". It has a real odd exhilarating and spooky quality to it. Plus I get the bonus DVD of his creative video work. Peter is an media artist in the best sense of the word. At once both thought provoking and energetic. He is running on all cylinders here.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|Elegantly differentiates high income earners+high spenders from wealthy based on their mind set, behaviors and approach to life. Highlights frugality but also balances this with charity. Observations are still valid today.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game.Don't have to spend cash to play. I could play this game all day. Works well on my kindle fire. If you like Tribez,you'll like this game.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love the Saga. Ilove the movies and now the high quality in it. Let the high quality force be with you!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I've only seen the first 3 episodes of Season 1, but I intend to continue watching this quirky, irresistible sci-fi show. The actors are first rate and the story lines are very engaging, if not absolutely plausible.  Good action and just enough blood and horror to make it hard to turn away.  Walter and Peter are a hoot!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|l have waited to long for this. &quot; what took this game so long to get here. &quot; now l 'm waiting for pet rescue. try not to take so long for pet rescue please. I don't have anything else to say about this game, that it's addictive.
0345803493|3.0|can't wait for the movie. It was a good read, now on part three. Very steamy sex all throughout. My....
1423368010|5.0|Incredible and deep study on how the brain is plastic.  A must read for those who believe that the brain can not heal and rewire itself.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|I don't understand the hype that was behind this movie. It's a great real life story. The telling of it here is ruined with poor writing, editing and directing. Poor actors had no chance.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Really good movie.  Liked the action and the plot. I liked it better than most of the original star trek movies.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|There's a lot to like in Dark Shadows, but somehow it doesn't quite equal the sum of its parts. Many of the performances are very good, the cinematography is gorgeously gothic, the music is moody and effective, and the setting -- a gothic version of coastal Maine -- is suitably evocative. But where the film lags is, I think, in tone. It's sometimes funny but still not quite a comedy, but also not quite the melodramatic horror/romance story it's based on. So it does many things well, but none of them great, and it feels like a few different movies stitched together.<br /><br />I wish Burton and Depp had fully committed to the source material and done a more faithful, modern reinterpretation. Instead, we got something that's not quite an adaptation and not quite a parody. And worse yet, its poor box office performance has probably set the franchise back a few decades as well. I think it will be a long time before we see another iteration of Dark Shadows, and that's the real shame here.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game,great on flights. Fun for everyone. Well done and operates smoothly. Challenging and ability to select difficulty level to keep the game interesting.
0060936223|1.0|Patti Smith is not the grandmother or godmother of punk rock. At least this book does not prove it. Jesus christ this book was boring. She is boring. Unfortunately, I own the book and the audio-book (avoid this like the plague). In this book she comes off as just another self-absorbed artist trying to become famous. She name dropped in every other paragraph while hardly connecting one idea to another. She talked far more about Mapplethorpe than herself. Not to mention she viewed everything through rose colored glasses. Everything was so peachy and great! Good PR book but a crappy read. Do not use this book for classroom use. You will bore your students to death.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny for adults and kids.  My 4 year old laughed and enjoyed it the whole way through. Does have lots of missiles, but no one gets hurt.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this product. It has great quality sound and video. I wish it can update and do more than just what it listed.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It was great. I really like what JJ Abrams brings to Star Trek. Good \\"remake\\" of an old classic. KAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHN!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Although this album is different than most of his other albums, it's still one of his best albums yet. There's a great variety of songs, so it never gets boring, and his lyrics are clever. He isn't anywhere near as vulgar as he used to be, which I was a little disappointed by.<br />Overall though, it's still well worth the money.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Get on board now folks so you can say you were there when it all started. When it's all said and done, this could be the next author that people group together with the legends of SciFi/Fantasy. Anthony Ryan has a chance to be something very, very special if he continues on where he left off with 'Blood Song'. By maintaining what he has already built he would have created something incredible-but if he has the ability to take his tale to another level, the results have the potential to become legendary. It's just that good.<br /><br />When anyone asks me to recommend a good book, Blood Song is without a doubt the one sure-fire answer I respond with.
0545586178|5.0|This second book was the best of the three books. I was so glad that I had Mockingjay on hand so I didn't have to stop reading. Thank you Amazon for tremendous service!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I LOVE it!  Graphics are the best! keeps your attention/mind sharp.  I'm stuck right now however and not sure what to do...humm..how to find the answer?, wish there was a way to get an answer when you're REALLY STUCK !
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The name Eminem has become synonymous with lyrical greatness in the hip-hop community for past decade and a half. MMLP2 serves his reputation well. This album has to be the most lyrical, intense, and creative Em has ever been. This piece offers superiority in beats, lyrics, collaborations, tasteful sampling, and last, but not least, closure. Eminem is one of my favorite rappers and I hold him to a higher standard than other rappers. He has far exceed my expectations and I'm very pleased to witness one of music's greatest innovators firsthand. Bravo, Shady!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I've been an off-and-on Eminem fan over the years. I liked the first three albums a lot, but lost interest around encore, and relapse, but then ended up liking about half of recovery. This album is a full return to form for me. It has all the aggression, clever satirical lyrics, and really tight beats that I loved about the early Eminem albums. Eminem also introduced some really great fusion with other music styles on this album which is a treat if you're musically open minded. This album exceeded all of my expectations.
0439023513|5.0|The entire series of three books was a really great read. I certainly wasn't expecting the ending but was pleased with it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love the upbeat somewhat classical, somewhat new-age, somewhat celtic type fiddling,.  Complements the classic fiddle style.  Lindsey is as good as Rideout, Mac Masters, to name a few.
B00992CF6W|5.0|To update this app delete it and  re install it your world's will still be there and now I'm in 0.7.6 right now it's awsome this game is the best it's number 1 on every app store
B009UZLRJE|1.0|Not only was the box partially destroyed when it came to me but, the disks are most definitely pirated and poor quality too. I sent back immediately and got my money back. I'll be getting this from best buy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A brilliant game I can't fault any thing about it very well<br />Put together. I'm now going to try the expert mode. More like this please.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I saw this on sale so just figured I'd try it out and it turns out that it's actually a pretty fun game. Worth trying I would say
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Sooooooo funny I would recommend this movie for the whole familyyou will get your daily laugh out of this one
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a mess.  Got lost between the 2 POVs.  Characters do a total turn around for no reason.  Truly, a waste. And let's not even go into the killing off of Tris for what?  So she can see her Mommy and know her work was done? And Four gets to be a whiny baby until the end when he learns its getting through every day life after a huge loss that is tough.  Ugh, a waste of time after 2 great books.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Even if you aren't a Trekkie, this movie will have you smiling and laughing from start to finish. This is a parody of Star Trek. It doesn't have to resort to stupid comedy tactics to make you laugh, just great acting and funny one-liners, one right after the other. This is a movie I added to my collection, when it first came out. It 'walked away', and I immediately bought another one. This film is a must have in anyone's movie collection. Every actor out-does themselves in this comedy, even the extras. I watch it whenever I need an emotional lift. Another thing I like about this film, is it doesn't disrespect Star Trek, or the fans.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|This was ordered a year or two ago.  Why are you asking me to rate it now?  If you had asked me sooner, the rating would have been better.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a really good app. When you play, you are a shark and you eat fish to stay alive. Its pretty addictive.
B00ESB6GBY|2.0|This season started out pretty well. At least we got to meet the mother. In fact, I thought I had read that she was going to be the first new regular on the show since it started. But....we've only seen her once and the show is really dragging. This is probably the worst season and I was really looking forward to it.
1476747016|5.0|The book is awesome, the sales guidelines for it not so much. I purchased a copy for myself and wanted to go back and purchase a second copy for a family member...apparently that's not cool. You are only able to purchase 1 copy of this item off of amazon? No one is that detailed and it's very frustrating.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does what it's supposed to do! It has a loud alarm.<br />I take my kindle everywhere so the alarm app is very convenient!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can watch all i want in 1 seconds without a cable, so its perfect to me this Media Player, only you need its wifi, that is all
006202406X|1.0|Garbage, a complete let down after the first two books.  The ending completely ruined the whole series for me.  It's just not something I can get on board with.  Plus, Allegiant in general didn't have the same eloquence in writing that I saw before.  I would not recommend this!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Again, James delivers an awesome story. A fitting end to Christian and Anastasia's story. I really like the insight to Christian's inner musings.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|I love the old westerns. Facinating reading but much better in a movie. I had this in a VHS tape and wanted to have the DVD.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At least for streaming Netflix to one of my TVs (which is not smart), it's ok. Other than that, for now... it's useless.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I didn't think it was that great , in that it is not Pulitzer material  It was confusing, as when you think one person is telling the story, and then you realize it's a different person talking, and you have to go back and reread to understand the time place, and person speaking.  Not my idea of a great book.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Well I'm just over half way through this incredible tale and not sure where it will go at the end. I can't stop reading, and highly recommend this awesome writer, well done Eleanor!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It is really  exciting. I can not wait to read the next book catching fire
B009POHHRG|5.0|We can't live without laughter#THE JOKER  IS BETTER THAN BATMAN  AND THAT LITTLE BOY HE RUNS AROUND WITH  # THE<br />JOKER
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read it straight through in one shot... broke my heart (somehow in that good way only beautiful things can). I can guarantee, I'll always remember Augustus Waters. So glad I'd never heard of this book before it was recommended by Amazon. I was able to take it all in without preconceptions - and then to find out a movie is coming? Kind of amazing. Thanks for writing such a soul touching little book Mr. Green.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Fantastic rocking cd from start to finish!  I'm 55 years old and felt 28 while blowing this out my speakers. Hearing aids here I come....Don't usually care for covers but Jesus is Just Alright is really, really good. Legacy, Sticks & Stones are favs. Deserves to sell well and put Stryper back on the map!!!!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I was always an avid Lee Majors fan and grew up watching the Six Million Dollar Man.  The Original Movie had me Hooked on Lee's Portrayal of Colonel Steve Austin before the Series ever Aired.  Watched these many times since purchasing and never get tired of the amazing special effects they used to make us believe that a Man could be Super Human in this way.<br /><br />Thanks Lee for the years you gave us as Colonel Steve Austin!<br /><br />And Amazon thank you for making it affordable for those of us who love this show.<br /><br />Sharman L Bowman
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is a page turning story. Well told. The cucumstance is not one I was g<br />Familiar with but is apparently historically true. Good characterization s and just an interesting story.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|Really cute. But it wasn't as great as what I've come to expect from Disney/Pixar. But I did enjoy it.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|How does EMINEM continue to rise above?  I think this album is better than recovery and it does not disappoint.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have always been a fan of Merriam Webster and when I recently got this Kindle Fire I was thrilled that I could download the offline app. I often use the website, but this works just as well except maybe even better because you can't cat a website around. I really love words and phrases that mean funny things and a lot of them I discovered on Merriam Webster.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I waited about a month to get mine but was worth the wait. I have had it for a couple of months and it has performed flawlessly. The initial set up was very easy, just plug it into your TV, follow the easy instructions, and you are good to go. I had to download the Chrome browser onto my computer which was also very easy to do. Once that was done I'm easily able to watch Netflix, Youtube , and anything else I can open through the Chrome browser and the picture looks great, no problem with sound either. Yes the apps are somewhat limited now but I expect more will continue to be added. It already automatically did an update on its own so no problem there either. If you are looking for a device to stream to your TV I don't know how you can do it cheaper. I recommend it for those who are not tech savvy as well as those who are.
0307346617|5.0|-Zombies<br />-Realistic (as far as zombies can be)<br />-Author is Max Brooks<br />Do you honestly need another reason to buy this book?<br /><br />The story follows a unnamed man (The Interviewer) who reports and documents on a war between humans and zombies. (Don't want to spoil anything)<br /><br />This review is being written after the movie &#34;World War Z&#34; with Brad Pitt. They are similar in regards to realistic zombies  and how an outbreak would happen/survival skills. But the plots are far from the same. Both enjoyable in my opinion.<br /><br />Also buy his other wonderful book &#34;The Zombie Survival Guide&#34;. In &#34;World War Z&#34; they follow many of the elements that are in &#34;The Zombie Survival Guide&#34; (which is actually a great all-round survival guide)
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The best Superman since christopher reeeves in S1 AND S2. Henry Cavill really does an amazing new superman michael shannon was amazing as General Zod and the surprising person that i would say stole the spotlight in many scened was the beautiful antje traue has the sub commander Faora. Every actor was superb the special effects the score everything was jut perfect.
B00E9ZATJO|3.0|Great way to follow up with Monsters Inc. just a little disappointing it came out so many years later. My 5 year old nephew and 10 year old daughter love this movie
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This book sums everything up perfectly. As another reviewer mentioned, it's not the end I was hoping for, it was even better. :) I LOVED this entire series, and will definitely miss these characters.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This is Avril Lavigne's best album since Let Go and Under My Skin. Amazing! Album of the year! Must buy. Buy this. You Are Welcome.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|it was delived the day before release and came just as stated!! awesome album glad head is back in the band
B00DD49R0E|5.0|My 2 and 5 year old nephews are absolutely obsessed with Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 and ANYTHING minions for that matter. It is crazy how much this has taken over but it is a super cute movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game very addicting and many hours to play believe me you play one game and you can't stop got to play the next level and the next before you know it you have been playing it for hours
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Bought this as a xmas present for my fiance. It came in a beautiful metal casing. He has been looking for the extended version forever. Can't wait to give it to him. Was a little hefty on the price seeing its only a dvd but I can't complain because I know he will love it. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get an awesome movie in a very nice case.
B00C2IN76C|5.0|Excellent packaging, love these steelbooks. For me, WATCHMEN is the best comic book adaptation ever made​​. First it is a masterpiece of Alan Moore. According think, as far as possible, been transposed faithfully to the cinema.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Intelligently written to all of us who enjoy a scary mysterious world!<br />Look forward to the next on the series.
0753827662|3.0|Very little wear visible, however, it seems to have been exposed to water or packed in a distorted manner, as the bottom of all pages at the outer corner is deformed.  Still a decent readable paperback.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|This movie is a must see. Especially if you are a family off cops. Funny and very entertaining and will have the whole family laughing and quoting it forever.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|ey, it looks elegant, i can have it as any daily. i strong recommend this sleeve it's nice and elegant
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love FRINGE and am so glad that Amazon has all the episodes for me to watch in order at my own pace!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I wished it could have gone on for a few hundred more pages!!
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Love this movie. Got both on bluray for $20 dollars around christmas time for fiance. Definitely worth getting on bluray.
B0058U0EEO|5.0|Love this album - sexy, relaxing and fun. I think that album cover defines the music content. I love it!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Ever since Stryper broke up in the 90's I've been waiting for them to get back together.  When they reunited a few years ago I was excited.  I enjoyed the \\"Reborn\\", \\"Murder By Pride\\" and \\"The Covering\\" but it still was not the Stryper I remembered.  I loved \\"Second Coming\\" because it was the old songs I enjoyed in the 80's.  But still I wanted more.  \\"No More Hell To Pay\\" is the project I've been waiting for.  Stryper has their edge back.  I love how a lot of the songs are in minor keys.  I also like that Oz and Michael are doing guitar solos again.  \\"Reborn\\" and \\"Murder By Pride\\" didn't have very much of that.  Oz and Michael's harmonized guitar solos have always been one of my favorite components of the Stryper sound that I enjoyed.  This is a great project.  If you liked the Stryper of the 80's you'll love \\"No More Hell To Pay\\".
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|My kind of Stryper music has finally made a comeback.  The guys have always been great, but the music wasn't what I remembered. I can honestly say I don't have to settle for a new style with this release.  This music is like the good 'ol days music I brag to my kids about.  Welcome back guys and thanks for FINALLY releasing another TRUE Stryper album.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|I got this game..well, it must be on sale because it's a pretty good game.  You can go into the settings mode and change the graphics performance..so I lowered mine thinking it wouldn't make big difference but it did.  The game ran a lot faster and used much less battery life after I took off maximum graphic level.  One thing about this game is that it is a game about creating games.  You use different combinations of things like Action/Samurai and you have to figure out which ones have the best responses/reactions.  What really helps is when you are just starting out, going for contracts.  You want to make sure your workers can complete the job in time, however, so pay special attention to their levels and make sure you level them up!  Contracts give research data, research boosts from the salesman help boost your research data and keeping your staff motivated helps as well.  Research data is what I call: What you need to make everything better.  You need it to level up your staff, to use boosts in game development, to use other tools in the game.  I've used research data several times to boost game stats.  My tips: Don't spend too much money at once.  You want to make sure you always have enough money to pay your staff and create a new game.  Stick with one console for a bit before you invest in another one, they get really pricey later on in the game.  I recommend a gaming console that covers at least 10% of shares.  I highly recommend this game for anyone that enjoys simulation games.
0738737909|5.0|I love these Cards the art work is beautiful...I am just starting my journey in learning the tarot....I had the radiant rider wait they were great but these bring them to life and envoke the meaning even more...I actually love them so much I have one deck I read for friends at home..and I purchased another deck as a back up...Love Love Love.........

B0083H6AQA|5.0|Accurate film, respect the original Maupasant novel, elegant, sensual but not sexual, depectics the Parisian turn of the century society very well.
B008MEM24S|1.0|This game circumvents Amazons normal parental controls to allow children to make extra purchases. Deceptive and shameful. Disney decided to be an anti-family company with this one.

B0081L391C|5.0|I loved this movie. I am a HUGE Jonah Hill fan, and he was spot on hilarious in this. They are actually making a sequel called 22 jump street. Should be pretty cool. Here's hoping..
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Lovely mini-series. Great storyline, and just very well made. The plot line is interesting and the characters are not perfect, rich people. Fantastic- buy, will not be disappointed.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is the best hunting app available on the market for tablets and phones. I've been searching for this type of game for awhile now of this caliber. Good job!

B005CA4SJW|5.0|Completely addicted to this series along with rest of world! Managed to watch over one weekend although will re watch. Completely addictive viewing must purchase
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game but as you get farther it's almost impossible to pass without buying power ups or extra moves.
B0000844I8|5.0|Love this movie and James Spader and since I wore out the old VHS tape is great to be able to watch again. Thanks for updating to new technology so I can keep watching.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Such a great account of a SEAL, the truth of combat that we civilians will never know or understand, and a picture of what the American spirit is all about.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Purchased for my dad who wanted this as a present he loved it. Have watched it and definitely held up great movie to rewatch and would recommend thanks
1476727651|5.0|haven't read it yet, but it is beautiful hard cover, and arrived promptly, it will certainly be part of my Stephen King collection
045122499X|4.0|The book was exactly as advertised-- and in really good shape. As for the contents, Follett's first work, Pillars of the Earth was better.
B00CY5Y37U|5.0|beautiful packaging. i have not listened to this album in quite a while and it was great listening to it again... and the extra tracks, videos and interview made this an excellent purchase. best songs: summer rain, leave a light on, and runaway horses.
1455508977|5.0|I love all if his books have read most and this one was also brilliant. Would recommend. Easy read great characters. Thanks
1416972242|5.0|Enjoyable ride that left me wanting more! I finished it faster than I thought I would. Couldn't put it down. I had to know what happened next!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Despite the homophobic remarks of the author, this is a great book. It reminds me a lot of japanese sci fi. And animated works of Hayao Miyazaki but a little darker. Can't wait for the movie.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Over the past year I read all of the Vince Flynn Mitch Rapp series.  I will miss them greatly.  Daniel Silva's books are a great replacement.  The intrigue, the plot, the characters, and the twists and turns are amazing.  The fallibility of the protagonist only adds to the suspense.  I am on the 4th book now, \\" A Death in Vienna\\" and it already has me thinking within the first few pages!  Wonderful series...Highly recommend
B009LDCXNY|5.0|So excited there is an eighth season so addicted to this series for so many years but watch and if you haven't started buy them all! Excited there is still two more series too come! Highly recommend
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was very good though i would suggest maybe an ending you know like cinderellas happy ever after .  I just like the series so much i just wanna keep reading about these characters. AWESOME SERIES!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very addictive game. Depending on how you play it can be easy or difficult. Pearls are hard to get and a lot of the game revolves around them.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|There's a buzz in the music world.  Veteran rockers, Stryper have released their latest original studio album.  No More Hell to Pay, which includes the original lineup, hit the streets on November 5.  The buzz has been brewing for several weeks as the band has been releasing samples and even streamed the entire album a few days ago.<br /><br />First, it's important to admit a strong bias, upfront.  I've been a Stryper fan since 1983.  Those were the days of parachute pants, cassettes, and mullets.  Thankfully, we've moved on.  But Stryper only continues to improve.  Four guys in their 50′s know how to deliver the goods.  This is no-nonsense, melodic hard rock that honors the Lord Jesus Christ.  This very well-produced album is their hardest rocking album to date - a venerable feast for the ears.  Michael's vocals are as strong as ever.  The guitar work is terrific.  The visual time-keeper doesn't miss a beat.  And we can actually hear Tim Gaine's pumpin' the notes on his bass!<br /><br />The opening track, Revelation, is a thundering tune that reminds listeners that there will be an accounting for sin.  God's wrath will be unleashed on every unrepentant person.  The revelation will bring a final reckoning.<br /><br />The title track, No Hell to Pay picks up where To Hell With the Devil left off with a hang banging tribute that celebrates the salvation that believers enjoy in Christ.<br /><br />Tunes like Sticks and Stones, Renewed,  Saved By Love, Te Amo, Sympathy, and Legacy highlight Michael Sweet's powerful vocals and guitar work.  The three-part harmony that has marked Stryper for over three decades is what truly makes this band special.  And who can forget the double-solos that Oz Fox and Michael Sweet bring to the table.  These guys are underrated and deserve to be noticed.<br /><br />Water Into Wine is a Christ-centered anthem that alerts listeners to the power of the Messiah - the One who healed the sick and casts demons out.<br /><br />The One takes Stryper fans back to the days of ballads like Together as One and Honestly.  This powerful tune has Michael Sweet's signature vocals and songwriting written all over it.<br /><br />For all the critics who counted Stryper out - think again.  Michael, Robert, Oz, and Tim have paid their dues.  The men in yellow and black are back and they're stronger than ever.  No More Hell To Pay may very well be the comeback album of the year!er fans back to the days of ballads like Together as One and Honestly.  This powerful tune has Michael Sweet's signature vocals and songwriting written all over it.<br /><br />For all the critics who counted Stryper out - think again.  Michael, Robert, Oz, and Tim have paid their dues.  The men in yellow and black are back and they're stronger than ever.  No More Hell To Pay may very well be the comeback album of the year!

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Good racing game. AWESOME graphics and really cool maps. Graphically it is unmatched. It also has a multiplayer unlike other racing games on mobile.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Great story! It's definitely a tearjerker. Great twist at the end, I enjoyed reading it very much! Would definitely recommend it.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|a great training book - should be utilized with the training manual. I like the point of view and the emphasis away from the &#34;machines for machines' sake&#34; attitude that is pervasive in gyms, etcl
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Addictive tv viewing must watch if you aren't already hooked! Season two even better than one if you can imagine and now onto season 3. Great way to spent a whole weekend! Definitely recommended viewing
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The novel intro is captivating. The characters , for the most part, are realistic, however the narrative and courtroom drama is drawn out for a book.  This works well on film but not a book.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I simply enjoy all things Angry Birds. The variety of characters offered is great. It is an awesome game to play when you have had a bad day and need some cheering up. Nothing like destroying nasty star wars pigs to distract you from your worries for a while.
0891903313|3.0|I am writing this review, not about The Little Prince story, but the quality of the actual book. This would have been a beautiful, hardcover book had the printer taken the time to let the ink dry. The book has a blue, gold-embossed, leather-like cover, and the text pages are printed in black and white (I think the original version has color illustrations) on what feels like good quality paper. Nonetheless, many of the pages where there are black and white illustrations, the ink offset on to the page on top, leaving a faint shadow over the text. On some spreads, the text is so faint I wonder if the book was printed on a xerox machine. I wish I was able to show photos of the book, but it seems like Amazon has removed that function from the review section.<br /><br />I love The Little Prince so I am giving it 5 stars for the lovely prose by St. Exupery and translation by Katherine Woods, but I am knocking off two stars for the terrible print quality.<br /><br />Since there are so many editions of The Little Prince out there, I am including the ISBNs so people will know which copy I reviewing.<br /><br />ISBN-10: 0891903313<br />ISBN-13: 978-0891903314
B005FISC52|5.0|Live this series been completely addicted to this show for years watch every season back to back over a weekend and have re watched them as well! If you haven't gotten into this series you must!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Totally dumb.  Totally hilarious!  A friend of mine recommended this, and I put off getting it because it just sounded too stupid to even watch.  Well, I broke down and bought it.  I am glad I did.<br /><br />It is a reversal of the hillbilly v college kids genre.  You really have to see it to appreciate how funny it truly is.  Do yourself a favor, grab a beer or two, slip this in, check your brain at the door, and laugh.  A lot.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The best review I make is that I did not want it end. I look forward to the next installment.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Gives you a complete new perspective of the graphic novel and comic book super heroes. This book has brought us through a transitional era that hasn't been seen in this medium since the 1930's.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|It did not run properly. It stops two hours after I take it off at night. The day and time dials do not change properly. I am returning it for replacement.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Elvis Costello is one of those artists that have been around for a long time.  Why?  He isn't afraid to expand.  To try different things.  He will perform in different genres just to, I imagine, expand his horizons.  He is not stuck in one place.<br /><br />This CD will take a couple of listens to get used to - but that is no reason not to have it - especially if you are Costello fan.  I will not go into a song by song breakdown, suffice to say that Mr. Costello puts it all out there.  It is a shame that we very rarely hear him on commercial radio.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game is challenging but not too difficult.  Would like more levels to play.  The game was completed too soon.  Some ability to get hints would be nice, but I didn't see where you could do it.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Much funnier and more heart-warming than I expected! A great family movie. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a clean comedy.
1250030951|5.0|Rainbow Rowell is swiftly moving up the ranks of my favorite authors, and Fangirl is a substantial reason why. She perfectly merges the delight of fanfiction and fandom with the loneliness of freshman year of college, tempered with the joys of finally finding where you belong.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the delicate ebb and flow of Cath and her twin's friendship, and Rowell skillfully managed the resolution of the various plot lines without veering into the saccharine.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Motorhead.  Need I say more?  Actually, for the reviews I do - to fill out the requirements.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Motorhead, you will have this already, or you will be ordering it soon.  If you are not a Motorhead fan, you may want to give this a try.<br /><br />These guys can still rock - even after all these years.  Totally amazing.  I cannot say anything about them that hasn't already been said or written - let the music do the talking.
B00E9PMMX0|2.0|I bought this set without fully reviewing it first, which was a huge mistake.  I just read the packaging as being the ORIGINAL trilogy episodes which I took as being the original theater releases and not the special edition episodes with added scenes and graphics.  I am not a fan of the prequels at all, but do like Episodes 4, 5 and 6.  I am somewhat glad I have these on a Blu-Ray/DVD set,  but would been happier with the the proper original releases.  Lucas Films and those who market Star Wars films went from being brilliant to being awful and deceiving.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend who loves Judas Priest, he loved the DVD, just like being there, and he plays it loud.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|My daughter loves this doll, so do I. The dress is perfect, beauty long hair and great colors. Doesn't include a lot of accessories,
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|These guys are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands.  If you haven't heard this CD yet, I recommend it.  If you are a fan, just click on the &#34;order&#34; button.<br /><br />There really isn't too much to say except that the writing is crisp, the music is tight, the production is sharp.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Wow, thank God Marvel redemed itself with Iron Man 3!! Iron Man 2 was okay, great special effects but just a very boring and dull story!!!  The special effects in this movie were awesome.  Loved the characters and the whole story line.  Gwyneth was fantastic in this movie and was just smoking hot at the end when pissed off!!! I bought the bluray version and it came with the DVD version so my kids can watch it in the backroom or in the car and they have been doing just that.  This movie witll be going with us on vacation, it really is that good!!!!<br /><br />As always, Amazon.com is top notch!!!  I have been purchasing more and more things online than I do on eBay because why waste my time on bids when I can find new for about the same price and have free shipping!!  My Package showed up on my door the day it was released, pack very carefully too!!!!
B001TAFCBC|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. If you had a way to erase something or someone from your mind, would you? An interesting and different kind of &#34;love&#34; story
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|love this book. read it in three days. I love reading a book that keeps me on my toes, and this book did that.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I like the direction that this series is taking.  Benedict Cumberbatch makes a frightening villain because he is so ordinary looking - not what one expects of a villain.  And appreciate how they reversed the roles between Spock and Kirk in their dealings with Khan.<br /><br />This is a great bunch of actors, and I hope they keep them together for the long haul.
B00AVL23YE|1.0|After downloading on my LG G2 to get all my email accounts into one place I got a security warning that there had been a login attempt from Israel and that I should change my password. I don't think this app is secure and I will be deleting it and changing my passwords.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My children love this game.  It's not as fun as the first one but it has it's moments.  My children really love how you can change your characters the most.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|The first half is very strong and rivets you in your seat.  Special effects are very good along with the acting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more levels. Not too easy, kept me busy for a bit. Didn't cause freezing or other issues with my Kindle like other games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game ! With patience you earn new lives and adventures without having to purchase lives, by choice. Fun to play with or without friends. Everyone can play and enjoy.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|It passed time with some funny segments, but really, they should have stopped at one. Bringing the baby back was, oh time up.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Makes me have to think but I still have fun playing this game even when I lose sometimes.  I got my step mom playing it now too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought because I had watched the movie before starting the book; it would be a forced read. I fell in love with the characters all over. Can't wait to start book number two!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Kindle have this game available now. I play better with it on my Kindle. Happy that I have it. I love my Kindle.
0143038583|5.0|Highlights how the American diet is bad for us and bad for our environment. Great read! Read Michael Pollan's books.
B000084HAJ|1.0|REVIEW OF GARDINER'S MONTEVERDI VESPERS ON ARCHIV.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but the Emperor is exposed.  This may or may not be a great performance (I personally find it, like almost all of Gardiner's work, to be pointless virtuosity, utterly cold).  However, the recording--if one may generously call it that--is egregious.  Such a dark, dull, grainy, smudgy image was unacceptable in 1988 and it's even more unacceptable now.  Gardiner and others have released the Monteverdi Vespers on CD, and I would humbly recommend you enjoy it via sound recordings for now.<br /><br />If you really must have it on video, try the [[ASIN:B0000Y92N2 Diego Fasolis version]].  Although not ideal is vastly preferable to Gardiner's dungeon-like experience.<br /><br />Also one should note, there are NO subtitles although the cover information would seem to indicate otherwise.  (Useful marketing tip:  false advertising helps sales.)<br /><br />:(
1937053571|5.0|It’s over, and while I write this there are still tears in my eyes.<br /><br />Gods that ending really tore me up.<br /><br />So the story picked up exactly where the last one ended. Alex wakes up from being in Olympus and is pretty banged up. But of course Aiden thinks she looks beautiful no matter what (because he is perfect). They are trying to find a way to kill Ares, but they all know that the only way that will happen is if Alex becomes the God killer instead of Seth. And that’s all I’m going to say about that.<br /><br />Gods I just feel like I was taken on an emotional ride and it all took place in the last 30 pages. I kind of wish the whole book was that emotional, but then my entire face would be a giant puff ball rather than just my eyes. And that ending was perfect- it was touch and go there for a second, but I’m really happy about where we are leaving all the characters.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Good  suspense...easy to read and enough turns to keep you guessing awhile.  Good author.<br />I will add her to my read list.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Awesome game they just need more levels I've waited a year and no more levels have came out but I love the playground but all in one it's an awesome game
B0000Y92N2|3.0|FASOLIS, NOT GARDINER.  This is a quick review on the Fasolis Monteverdi Vespers, the only video alternative to Gardiner, so far as I know.  I'm basically only going to compare one to the other.<br /><br />The picture is not nearly as dark as Gardiner's, thank God.  However, it's still not bright enough to be totally satisfying.  Both were apparently filmed at night in a cathedral using existing light.  This recording having been made in 1999, i.e. 10 years later, I would have thought they'd seize the opportunity to make up for every problem in their competition.  Alas, they didn't.<br /><br />Still, the picture is incomparably better than Gardiner's.  The video also is sharp and pleasing ... light-years ahead of Gardiner's grainy, faded image that looks like it was transfered from an old reject VHS rental.<br /><br />The sound, technically, is also much better than Gardiner's.<br /><br />Fasolis' vocal group is competent, they are not at all terrible, but admittedly they cannot hold a candle to Gardiner's world-class English Baroque Soloists.  Gardiner's choir sings faultlessly, from memory.  Fasolis' group is more a group of talented amateurs, with their noses buried in the score for the most part, not that that is a crime.  Fasolis' soloists are weakest, not terrible, but what one might expect from a local production and wish for better.<br /><br />I would rate Fasolis' instrumentalists at least equal to Gardiner's.  They are a professional group, evidently not directly affiliated with the choristers.  They also have a little more freedom with ornamentation, which I like.<br /><br />Neither set has subtitles.  How much it would sway recommendations if either set had 90 minutes of subtitles!<br /><br />In short ... a truly great, musically, visually, and sonically satisfying Monteverdi Vespers has not yet appeared on DVD.  If you need perfection, my recommendation is to stick it out with CD's, and wait for better days ahead.t with CD's, and wait for better days ahead.
0547366205|5.0|Adorable book especially for bi-racial children! My daughter loved that there were children of every color in this book so it made it more real for her.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game...play all the time. The only thing about it that drives me nuts is some levels they make so hard they are almost impossible to do. A lot of people complain about this but are so addicted you can't quit playing. I know it is the challenge with playing the game but if you can't get past a level where is the fun. But I will still play because when you finally get past the &#34;stuck&#34; level is is so great!

0142403873|4.0|This is an excellent version of an old story. The pictures are wonderful and the plot moves in small enough chunks for the littler readers. It should have 5 stars but it has been surpassed by the DVD, which is even better.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|A bit like reading about Cinderella 20 years after her ball with Prince Charming. You still care about the character but you really don't want to hear about life after the fairytale; you'd rather be left with the memory of the dance.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|There are 47 cds in this box set. The cds are housed in cardboard sleeves that are like little LP covers. The cds are not individually shrink-wrapped.  Unfortunately that is the way cds and dvds are packaged a lot of the time, just slipped into cardboard.  I would have prefered digi-packs. Oh well. All the 2LP sets are 2cds except for Self-Portrait which is 1 cd. It's CD cover opens like the old LP set, as do all the other 2cd sets' covers.<br />  The box is very sturdy. It says 14 cds are newly remastered but it's actually 15 including \\"Self Portrait\\" which was previously only available with the deluxe copy of Bootleg Collection #10. The 2 cd set of extra tracks, \\"Side Tracks\\" is also remastered. It includes all the tracks from \\"Biograph\\" that are not duplicates of LP/CD tracks, the six tracks from Greatest Hits II, One track from Greatest Hits III and a couple of others. Unfortunately it does not include \\"Rita Mae\\".  The tracks on the 2 cds set are in chronological order.<br />  Speaking of chronological, you would need to listen to Basement Tapes after Blonde on Blonde and before John Wesley Harding and \\"Dylan\\" after Self-Portrait and before New Morning to hear them in order.<br /> For now, don't sell your old remastered copy of \\"Street Legal\\". It sounds much better than the copy in this box set. My guess is the copy in this box set is a remaster of the old original mix. The other digi-pack remaster is re-mixed and remastered and sounds much better than the copy in this box.<br />  The cover art for \\"Shot Of Love\\" does not list \\"The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\\", but it is on the disc. \\"Shot Of Love\\" is remastered. There was pre-sale discussion that it would not be, but it is beautifully remastered and \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" never sounded so good.  Also in pre-sale discussions, someone said there was a glitch in their copy of \\"Self-Portrait\\" that they got with deluxe Bootleg Collection #10.  There is nothing wrong with the \\"Self Portrait\\" cd with this box set.  I wish it was digi-packs but it's still an awsome collection of music.<br />  Your Mono box is not obsolete because these are all stereo.<br />  The hardcover booklet is 255 pages and reproduces no lyrics (The LP/CDs never did) However it has all the poems from Dylan's LPs and the short story from the back of John Wesley Harding. It's a very nice booklet with photos and the last 40 or so pages written by Clinton Heylon. It's well constructed and has sewn binding.<br /><br /> Added Dec 14:  If you have a copy of Hard Rain with the 2 glitches, email the address Amazon provided and they will get right back to you. I sent them a copy of the Amazon invoice copied from \\"your orders\\" and then \\"invoices\\". I copied the invoice with the black border around it and pasted it into my email and no problem. They were great about getting another copy of Hard Rain out right away, no problem. I would not let that detract anyone from buying this set.<br /><br /> The 2cd set, \\"Side-Tracks\\" has:<br />  Disc 1<br />  1) Baby I'm In The Mood For You<br />  2) Mixed-Up Confusion<br />  3) Tomorrow Is A Long Time (live) (From Greatest Hits II - Previously Remastered)<br />  4) Lay Down Your Weary Tune<br />  5) Percy's Song<br />  6) I'll Keep It With Mine<br />  7) Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?<br />  8) Positively 4th Street (From Greatest Hits - Previously Remastered<br />  9) Jet Pilot<br />  10)I Wanna Be Your Lover<br />  11)I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)(Live)<br />  12)Visions Of Johanna (live)<br />  13)Quinn The Eskimo (Basement Tapes)<br />  14)Watching The River Flow (From Greatest Hits II - Previously Remastered)<br />  15)When I Paint My Masterpiece (From Greatest Hits II - Previously Remastered<br />  When I Paint My Masterpiece no longer has the applause that comes at the end of Tomorrow Is A Long Time (live).<br />  On Greatest Hits II, the 2 tracks fade together.

B00E9ZATJO|5.0|How can  children watch the same movie over and over and over? My granddaughters like this one so much it's getting worn out already!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The book The Maze Runner started off great in the first couple of chapters. I really liked the part when Thomas wakes up in the lift, and the only thing he can realize was his first name.  It gives a sense of mystery and anticipation. However, the only criticism I had was that as the story progresses, it starts to get repetitive and boring. The main reason that this book became really boring is that there is very limited variety of settings in the story. The whole story takes place in a limited and confined area called the “Glade” secured by mazes, which feels very claustrophobic. It gives some readers a hard time to stay focused.<br /><br />The great part of this novel is that James Dashner, the author of this book created a really interesting theme throughout the story. It emphasizes that friendship and teamwork are the most important factor in solving many problems. Without a strong sense of community and personal relationships, the “Gladers” would not be able to survive. They relied on one another to fill certain roles allows for a functional society that is self-sustaining.<br /><br />Overall, this book was enjoyable if you are into puzzles, fantasies, and if you are not claustrophobic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it!  Like that I can earn more nuts without buying them all the time!  Fun, fun game! Have been playing for a couple of years now!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is sad but so heartwarming at the same time. I love the message it sends to men and women about the importance of family and the sanctity of marriage. It is a great encouragement and I think it would be awesome if my husband would sign a declaration like the men in this movie did.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Her story is far too boring to be worthy of its own book. She is so complacent and lifeless. The story regarding her brother's return was interesting though and it was something I had never heard before.
B004YMRIMS|5.0|Great cd, i used to have it then i lost it, and i decided to get it again, because it is a great metalcore cd, i would say great songs on it, all around great cd.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I have been playing on my Iphone for ages.  I was very excited to get the Kindle Fire app.  Well, the levels are different than the Phone version.  On a level in lower 220's, there was a bomb off to the left that wasn't there on the phone.  Then, if I am one away from the number needed to reach the next level, I will make the purchase to get &#34;bombs&#34; to move forward.  On the Kindle version, I had to purchase six different times to get through the level.  This has never happened before and I won't be purchasing anymore help on the Kindle.One last thing, I had a huge amount of lives on the phone and when I tried the Kindle version, they were all gone.  So, I will not be playing on the Kindle Fire version of CCS .  Went from being very very excited to very very disappointed.
145162607X|5.0|I've read them all and I've read Jean Plaidy's story of Anne in the Reluctant Princess and I believe this is the best of the Cousins series behind my all time favorite, The White Queen. Gregory really gives Anne some dimension as we are privy to some of her shameful feelings. It's also such a good portrayal of Richard who I refuse to believe is like Shakespeare's version. You won't regret getting this one
B000002L9M|5.0|One of my Favs depeche mode cd i listen to all the tracks without skipping any songs, is a perfect cd, great songs, my fav is black celebration, a question of time.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory continues to be one of my favorite shows.  I am a full on entertainment junkie and this show will make you laugh over and over again.  The cast is brilliant, the writers are genius and the story is wonderfully clever.  I love this show I watch and re-watch them again and again.  Not too many shows will earn my stamp of approval when it comes to buying them on dvd so you can own them but this one does.  I will only spend my hard earned cash on shows that are truly great and when this one hits the shelf I don't even hesitate.  It doesn't matter what kind of person you are if you give this show a chance you will love it.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I am extremely disappointed in this app. Every useful.feature, including fonts and dictionary must be purchased separately. There is a much better free alternative in the app store. Get that one and save some cash.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is one of the best shows right now. I randomly watched the first House of Cards series on Netflix several years ago and I loved it and always told people they should watch it. I don't think it's reasonable to compare the two though. They are both great in their own way. This show was ripe with symbolism and it had all of the elements of any good tv show these days: sex, violence, mystery, anti-heros.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|steel panther rocks, their songs are funny and they can really play music, which is the most important songs, either you get it or you don't, and i get  their comedy, one of my friends was disgusted by their songs, and i was just laughing the whole time, while another friend totally got it, great cd, great band, the best band in the world.
B00005JOHC|3.0|The show itself is great but the case was a little busted up.  I knew it wasn't mint condition but I wasn't expecting that a dog chewed on it.  Still, worth the money.  You get what you pay for.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the funniest games I've ever played you will think it's easy but gets harder along the way
B00CDTSFF8|4.0|This was better than I would have thought. For some reason, since it's the History Channel I imagined it being like those terrible dramatic reenactments they have on all of their documentaries but it's a real show.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I saw them live this year, and it was before this cd came out, but i remember the song stone, was just starting to play and it was so great riff and heavy, and live they were awesome, so i decided to get the cd and it is a great cd, totally worth the $.
B001NN413K|1.0|I ordered this and had no idea it was Region 2.  Yes there is a small disclaimer stating that it won't play in most USA dvd players but I did not see it until I returned to the site after the DVD failed to work.  Now I am out $20 and my eight year old is sad because her movie won't work.  Please, Please, Please put the Region # at the top near the DVD title so people will know without having to search for it on the screen.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|an excellent book. i would definitely buy it if i were you. i did have some qualms about the book, though. excuse me if im being naive because i dont know much about warfare, but what  happened to all the antiship missilies china had? why didnt  they just blow up the ships that were restricting thier oil supply?<br /><br />other than that the book was excellent.

B007XCH150|4.0|This is probably Samanatha's Fox's most consistently enjoyable album. There's lots here to dance to, and a few sugary, good ballads as well. \\"I Surrender\\" and \\"If Music be the Food of Love\\" are among the best tracks. I have the two-CD edition, and I enjoy all the songs except the bonus track \\"The Right Stuff,\\" which is pretty bland compared to the rest of the material. My only real gripe is, while Samantha Fox scored her biggest U.S. hit with \\"Naughty Girls (Need Love Too),\\" the hit U.S. version is not included in this collection; there's an extended version of it, but it's just not the same as having the hit I remember. Other than that oversight, this is a solid album '80s fans will enjoy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|An amazing book, all three, can't wait for number four. If we are lucky Sylvia Day won't stop there. The story line is scrumptious, the sex is appealing without being raunchy. Perfect mixture for anyone over the age of 21 to read. Thank you. Five stars
1596177373|3.0|I like these cards, but they are a little cheap feeling, and all the pictures on the Jack, Kings, Queens, and aces are the same picture for all four on all other playing cards the Jacks are all diferent and all the Kings are diferent and so on.
B004YXE438|5.0|The best jigsaw puzzle around! Use your own images! Choose your difficulty. Days of fun. Great for road trips, or sitting at the airport terminal - Snap a pic, BLAM, instant puzzle!<br />6 stars if they would let me. Only drawback, is that you will lose your finished puzzle progression if you mess up the install. Also does not keep track of progress between devices. (sad face)<br /><br />Awesome!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|A great, addictive game with cute graphics and an engaging storyline. Very enjoyable. Apprpriate for all ages. Puzzles are not so hard that young ones will be discouraged.
B00F9040HU|4.0|This match 3 game is tough at times and surprisingly easy at others.  Unfortunately it doesn't come up  to the usual high standard of the other Playrix games.  The ending is rather  strange too.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I have yet to watch the movie in 3D, but definitely looking forward to it. I did watch the Bluray copy and it's a great high-quality movie. If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings, you will love The Hobbit.

B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I am having loads of fun!<br /><br />This was a nice free App Of The Day around Halloween, but I would enjoy it any day!<br /><br />It has the physics puzzles of Angry Birds, with cute animation and clever obstacles.<br /><br />I was only a few levels in when the game asked me to rate it. I hope that it continues to be fun and challenging!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This a great app!! I have not had a single issue with this app. Ready to use and takes great pictures. Thank you for the great app!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It takes up a lot of time.  Often it is impossible to make the score.  But it can be fun.
0061801313|5.0|I haven't started reading the series yet, as I am very busy all of the time. The  books, however, are greatly packaged in a nice little box keeping the 4 together. Love the TV series, so really looking forward to reading. They say the book is always better than the movie/TV show. We shall see!
B000HF0ILY|4.0|Although very good, this is not Eastwood's best.  The title comes from the biblical text in Revelations 6,  &#34;I beheld a pale horse, and his rider's name was Death&#34;  With that reference, Eastwood wears a clerical collar, and wields a deadly gun, as he (Eastwood) helps settlers who are being harassed by miners.  Violent but worth the watch.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Rousing tales of 18th century sea adventures the likes of Captain Cook provide a manly rough and tumble look at exploration, adventure, and discovery. Gilbert's Signature approaches big questions about the order of the universe with the same, at sometimes exasperating, attention to detail as a Higgs Boson researcher. Rather than join physicists who point to the night sky and listen for the Big Bang, Gilbert looked to botanists and the origins of moss to provide an orderly explanation for change – evolution.<br /><br />This is not a quick read – it is a very timely read that is well worth time invested to spend nine decades with a strong, female character. Gilbert manages to portray a brilliant 18th century woman during a bustling era of America who seeks perfection in scientific inquiry that underlies her own theory of change.<br /><br />What a pleasure it is to learn about the subtle workings of the organic world through the lens of a vibrant female character. Gilbert exemplifies the science of good writing. She constructed a well researched plot line, vivid characters, a believable setting, and a timeless yet timely theme.  Change is a constant challenge that Gilbert studied with the venues of gardens, rainforests, political thought, and spirituality. It’s a collector’s bag of insights about looking at and trying to understand - life.<br /><br />I finished the book last night. November 4th as a satiated reader. The plot seemed to round the Horn full circle by tying Captain James Cook with Charles Darwin. The final character introduced on the final pages is Gilbert’s homage to a relatively obscure 19th century botanist, A.R. Wallace who posited a theory of evolution concurrent with Darwin’s. To my utter amazement, the November 5, 2013 issue of the New York Times has a video on this real life scientist, The Animated Life of A. R. Wallace.  Thank you Ms. Gilbert for my first introduction to Mr. Wallace – meeting him again today is a bit of synchronicity.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read the shining years ago. Wished at a few points I had a copy to reference when reading Dr sleep but I'm glad I didn't . The book can stand alone. I enjoyed it immensely.  Didn't want it to end.

B00001ZWTT|4.0|They didn't use the same actors but this is a pretty good remake of the TV series.  Will Smith and Kevin Klein are the good guys who use a lot of gadgets to foil the bad guys, who have a lot of gadgets themselves.  Naturally, we wonder how they managed to have all these &#34;gadgets&#34; back in the Old West but it makes for fun.
1609611543|3.0|I am still struggling with how I should rate this book.  As other reviewers have stated, Wheat Belly feels a lot like an infomercial with all of its claims.  Seriously, I don't know that there's an ailment that Dr. Davis didn't claim that wheat is the cause behind. I don't recall reading anything in the book related to serious scientific studies (i.e., double blind controlled experiments); instead there was a whole lot of anecdotal \\"a patient came in to see me suffering from some problem.  I told him/her to go wheat free.  Four weeks later, he/she was miraculously cured!\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, right about the time you're bought in and ready to try going wheat free, the author unloads the full list of what he expects you to eliminate from your diet.  Besides all grains (including bran, barley and rye), the following are off limits: ales, beers, lagers, bloody Mary mixes, flavored coffees, flavored teas, wine coolers, vodkas and whiskeys distilled from wheat or barley, all cereals (including granola, puffed rice, and oat cereals), blue cheese, cottage cheese, gorgonzola cheese, roquefort cheese, artificial colors/flavors, emulsifiers, stabilizers, food starch, energy bars, fast food, cream of wheat, malt-o-meal, oatmeal, oat bran, deli meats, hot dogs, bacon, sausage, ketchup, malt vinegar, marinades, salad dressing, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, curry powder, seasoning mixes, taco seasoning, frosting, candy bars, chewing gum, corn chips, dry roasted nuts, licorice, potato chips, corn tortillas, bisques, broths, bouillon, canned soups, soup mixes, veggie burgers, beans, lentils, corn, rice, and on the list goes...<br /><br />Additionally, meats should be cooked at low temps (no searing on the grill or frying in oil).  Oh, and you're supposed to limit most fruit too.<br /><br />It feels like Dr. Davis has designed a diet that treats everyone like a diabetic ciliac. And if he had shown the FULL diet with all of its restrictions on page one of the book, I would have laughed and tossed the book away.  Getting this full list near the end of the book really felt like a \\"bait and switch\\" to me.<br /><br />So why not give the book 1 star, like a number of other reviews who feel the same way as me?  Because I tried eliminating JUST WHEAT (none of the other stuff) for four weeks and experienced something pretty amazing.  While the diet didn't cure me of all that ailed me, I noticed that my acid reflux was gone for the first time in many years.  I quit taking my various meds and was still consuming chocolate, red wine, spicy foods and tomatoes (all supposed culprits for acid reflux), yet my reflux was gone.  This past weekend, I did a little test and over the course of 3 days, I introduced a small amount of wheat back into my diet (a croissant, a couple pieces of pizza, and some bread sticks).  Within 30 minutes of the croissant being in my stomach, my reflux had returned.

I'm unconvinced that everything else Dr. Davis lists is a problem and I would have preferred to see him define a less restrictive approach for those of us who are not (pre)diabetic or ciliac instead of his \\"one size fits all\\" approach.ed and tossed the book away.  Getting this full list near the end of the book really felt like a \\"bait and switch\\" to me.<br /><br />So why not give the book 1 star, like a number of other reviews who feel the same way as me?  Because I tried eliminating JUST WHEAT (none of the other stuff) for four weeks and experienced something pretty amazing.  While the diet didn't cure me of all that ailed me, I noticed that my acid reflux was gone for the first time in many years.  I quit taking my various meds and was still consuming chocolate, red wine, spicy foods and tomatoes (all supposed culprits for acid reflux), yet my reflux was gone.  This past weekend, I did a little test and over the course of 3 days, I introduced a small amount of wheat back into my diet (a croissant, a couple pieces of pizza, and some bread sticks).  Within 30 minutes of the croissant being in my stomach, my reflux had returned.

B000001U3K|4.0|This is a classic album that should be remastered. I bought it just before Lou passed away, and I really enjoyed recalling and listening to nearly every song on the CD. Maybe now that Lou's gone, someone will do a remastering of this CD with bonus tracks. It still makes me chuckle that the &#34;colored girls&#34; singing on the CD were actually David Bowie, Mick Ronson (Bowie's guitarist at the time), and only one &#34;real&#34; woman.<br />I find it sad that &#34;Perfect Day,&#34; a lovely song, is now being mutilated in car commercials; maybe Lou's somewhere laughing as he sure sang it better!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and addictive.I love it when I can make for a long time without having to wait for lives to replenish.
B000RJO578|4.0|I have to admit that I had few positive expectations about this one. In fact, I was asking myself why I got this one anyway. Well, I certainly got more than I bargained for: this is a funny film. Plenty of slapstick, some doubtful moments when it looked to be going off the rails, but, all-in-all, a funny premise carried through to a very successful conclusion. No details, since much of the fun comes from the surprises, but suffice to say, this tale of a too-successful London police officer sent to the sticks (as we would say), that is, to a quiet country town where nothing ever happens, because he is making his London colleagues look bad by comparison, starts out with the frustration of said officer as he is taught nothing is ever allowed to get in the way of &#34;nothing ever happens&#34;. I enjoyed it  and think many viewers will also, unless a bit of silliness is beneath their dignity. I recommend giving it a try.
1439152810|5.0|Kate Morton's books (only 4 so far...sob) are better than excellent, and deserve 10 stars really.  This latest is one of the best.  Being a fairly good &#34;detective&#34; I can usually figure out much of a mystery as I'm reading it, but not with any of Ms. Morton's books.<br /><br />This one also jumped from past to present and back again, as have her other novels.  But she is so accurate and such a great researcher that I ended up learning a lot about England during WWII, some interesting things about Australia and a bit about psychology as well.  The characters, both past and present, truly come alive on the page and the mystery that develops is astounding!<br /><br />I do not like to spoil a book for anyone so I won't go into detail--I know others who've read it have done so.  So all I will say is that if you enjoy a well-researched, partly historical, twisty-mystery you will not be disappointed.

B00407PNY2|5.0|What can I say, I just love Steve McQueen movies and Bullitt was my favorite years ago.  I enjoy this movie even years later.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An avid fan of John Grisham, I was hooked the moment I read the first page of \\"The Practice.\\"  Reading each new book as soon as it was available,  Grisham legal mysteries zoomed to the top of my favorite reading list. Delving into exciting courtroom drama, \\"Sycamore Row\\" proved to be yet another Grisham adventure destined for instant popularity.  You'll not be disappointed with this well-written page-turner!
1891252089|4.0|I like this book.  Being rather new to yoga, I need all the help I can get with language, positions and theory - this is a good tool.  This book also has an element that I really appreciate, a binding that allows it to lie flat, so you can be on the floor and not fighting a page that wants to flip.

B007IQWQKG|4.0|The 33rpm version is compressed and lackluster by comparison, don't bother with it. Here, special cover = special sound. Dig it.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This is the Cartoon version of Gatsby.  THE LOONY TUNE CARTOON.  The Computer Graphics are terrible.  Hokey and fakes.<br /><br />Wretched excess is just barely enough.  One small example:  In the book, there is a grand piano that one of the characters plays.  Here?<br />This operatic Church Pipe Organ is right out of a Bela Lugosi vampire movie.<br />It's a detail that's not just over the top, it's so out of place and inappropriate as to be ABSURD.<br /><br />The title of the film, a few of the characters, the bare bones of the plot are Fitzgerald. Otherwise,<br />this is a STORY FROM LUHRMANS immagination that has nothing to do with the novel we know as The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />I didn't think it was possible, but this version makes the 1974 version with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow look like a FIVE STAR movie.<br /><br />What a wretched use of money.  Loud when there is no reason to be.<br /> You expect TRANSFORMER ROBOTS TO COME BUSTING THROUGH THE SCENERY<br />AT ANY MOMENT.  SPACE ALIENS.  THE CREW FROM STAR TREK.<br /><br />THE ATTACK OF THE KILLER SMURFS WHO KIDNAP GATSBY AND DAISY AND FLY AWAY TO<br />THEIR LAIR IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY.<br /><br />GOOD RIDDANCE.

B0077EBWVI|4.0|It is a good remade movie and follows the original really well.  If you like the original Footloose, this is a good movie to watch all dancing!!
B004WR125O|4.0|I'm pleased with how easy the hook up was with my Onkyo TX-8050.  Even though my wireless system is up stairs it comes through at about a 55% signal strength, a higher signal strength would have gotten 5 stars.  But it is affordable and easier then trying to lay a LAN cable down.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|The dolls come in nice packaging with a fold-out story book/bookmark.<br /><br />Hunter has flocked hair with a rooted swath on top. His features are nicely, evenly painted. His jacket is removable, but the cords on the jacket are just for decoration and do not work. He wears a tank top underneath. He has a removable brown bracelet. His pants have velcro in the back and have a silver charm sewn on in the front. He wears a plastic bag that really opens and brown plastic boots. His wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles are articulated. Hunter's head has a good range of motion.<br /><br />Ashlynn's head cannot tilt forward, so she can't look down. She wears a pink plastic tiara, gold earrings that easily pull out, a gold necklace, a gold ring, and a gold bracelet. She carries a gold purse with a clock decal on one side and molded clock decorations on the other three sides. Her dress is all one piece and fastens with velcro in the back. She wears ornate plastic shoes that wind around her ankles and calves. Her articulation is similar to Hunter's, but her ankles are not articulated.<br /><br />These dolls are well worth the price. The only improvements I would want would be for Ashlynn's ankles to be articulated and for her head to have a full range of motion. Smaller children might have trouble with Ashlynn's removable jewelry and hands.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this whole series...I wanted closure so badly with this book but I find myself just finishing and being so upset by what happened. I knew what was going to happen before I read it because I read the author's blog explaining her reasons for letting it end this way... and I just can't find it in me to agree with her. I knew Tris was going to do what she did and I agreed with that choice, but the serum didn't work and I feel the author made the wrong choice with what she had David do.
B004D38HOG|4.0|What an emotional head-trip Portia de Rossi’s memoir is. By the time I finished reading it, I was both glad the novel had stopped and so very thankful I’ve never had anorexia, bulimia, or cared about dieting. Having a choking phobia and being concerned with carbohydrate totals because of an autoimmune disease is bad enough thanks. I’m exhausted out of sympathy for all those who go through this, or a similar experience to Portia’s journey, as I imagine they must be truly exhausted.<br /><br />Knowing all of this happened and someone went through such an experience, as well as Portia’s struggle with accepting her sexuality, made it both easy and difficult for me to read. On the one hand; I’m so happy I was able to finish this in three days. I know if I had of taken a week or more then it would have messed with my head too much. Her tale and how she shares it digs deep into you and once those hooks are in… I’d be amazed if you felt no sympathy or pain for her whatsoever.<br /><br />Her struggle with bulimia and anorexia, her goal of reaching her unrealistic ideal, was obviously such an obsession for her and that obsession seeps through her words and is something you can’t avoid. When the story started to get really deep into the nitty gritty of her obsession that was when I found myself wanting to get away from it the most. I think if you’re not careful or have been having the same issues yourself, you might find your day-to-day life being influenced by reading Portia’s experience.<br /><br />On the other hand, even with my natural inclination of wanting to get away from so much negativity and tunnel vision, Unbearable Lightness was extremely easy to read and hard to put down. Portia has such a talent in getting you to relate and at times to feel her pain, it really is quite hard not to be won over and engrossed. I have read several comments in other reviews and in general ones about the book when it comes to editing though. Sure, there should probably be another editor or more editing, but in the end the story comes across feeling as though Portia is personally relating to you how she lived, breathed, and obsessed in those years of struggle.<br /><br />I have, and do have, problems with eating, but I’ve never had anorexia or bulimia. My eating difficulties are not connected to concerns of weight (unless I want to put it on because I am and feel underweight) and being accepted for my weight, so while I could connect on some level with Portia’s anxiety, fear, and rituals, struggling with weight is something I’m unfamiliar with and made it hard for me to relate.<br /><br />What I related to the most was her fear of her sexuality being exposed. The whole story made me want to cry, I was teary by the end of it, but her shame and fear stemming from being gay was just… I would say sexual orientation sucked, but really it’s society that does with something like this. Society, YOU SUCK. YOU SUCK HARD.<br /><br />No matter how much Portia has come to terms with everything and how great it was to actually read about it (not the whole journey of recovery, but the difference between her earlier thoughts and her far more happier ones), I still find myself so emotionally battered that I must do something nice for myself. It’s one of those types of stories, but it was definitely worth reading.r or more editing, but in the end the story comes across feeling as though Portia is personally relating to you how she lived, breathed, and obsessed in those years of struggle.<br /><br />I have, and do have, problems with eating, but I’ve never had anorexia or bulimia.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is hands down the greatest movie ever made. They don't make them like this anymore. That's all I have to say

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Finished Steve Jobs book. Anyone pursuing and MBA should read it. A brilliant and disturbing man! He changed the world in many ways, but he did not spend much time with his family. It seemed he was more hated than loved, but above all else he was respected. The best book I read this year......but trying to be an entrepreneur myself and all he went through and what it takes...It make you rethink if you really want to choose that path,...how deep you want to go in it, how much you want to sacrifice, and how much you let it control your life. The man had passion and loved his products. He is someone you should admire, but at the same time he shows you how not to do things. You can learn from his successes, but learn more from his failures. [[ASIN:B007JNKFDS The Mustard Seed]]

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It works just great for Netflix and YouTube.  I was counting on the promised \\"cast any Chrome tab from your mobile device\\".  That is not available at this time.  We decided to watch an amazon prime movie.  I thought that would be no problem as long as I used my computer.  The tab would show up on the TV but the video wasn't supported.  So far it has been a fail for the things I purchased it for.  I am trying to decide whether to return it or wait and see if eventually they will add the features I thought I had been promised to begin with.
B001NIA27E|5.0|Love it.  Use it as a fun video after my students learn about plate tectonics and volcanoes.  They get a big kick out of it.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This is a excellent accessory that is a must have for the few games that support it but it isn't a must have accessory because very few titles support it. Partially that's Nintendo's fault for making this a pain to buy (in North America it's exclusive to the Nintendo online store)and not advertising it. When I saw Nintendo wanted $5 for 5-8 day shipping and I can get here with prime 2 day shipping I bought here instead.<br /><br />Anyway, it does have one big flaw and that is it blocks the stylus slot and you have to take it off to get to the stylus. On the plus side, it's much more comfortable to hold the 3DS for long periods of time without your hand getting cramped like they do without this accessory.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is an awesome game that is full of adventures and the great thing about the game is it was free.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I'm excited to have discovered this album and this band. The track \\"Down By the Water\\" got my attention back when it was getting radio play a couple of years ago, but I didn't dig deeper into The Decemberists' catalog... until now.<br /><br />Every track is uniquely enjoyable. I've always been a fan of R.E.M. and there is considerable R.E.M. influence here (yes, Peter Buck is featured), but honestly, The Decemberists' songs are stronger and much more accessible. Colin Meloy weaves lyrics in a way that is both clever and meaningful. Driven, nautical, dark with a hint of optimism. \\"Don't Carry It All\\" is a new favorite tune. Looking forward to exploring more of the band's offerings.
B009Y6X65C|5.0|Great CD great bluesy style of music.. Reminds me of Stevie Ray Vaughn in a way,.. Great gift for my friend!

B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|Season five of The Vampire Diaries introduces us to a brand new world.  The Originals have fled to New Orleans, Elena and Caroline have started college, Stefan is missing in action, Katherine's human, Bonnie's dead, Silas is walking around with Stefan's face, and Jeremy and Damon are roommates. The show truly has a different feel to it that we haven't seen from the previous seasons and I'm excited to see where the storylines are going.  If you're familiar with TVD, you know things change pretty fast and this season is no different. Honestly, the whiplash I get from watching is one of the biggest reasons this is my favorite show.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Since she takes them off when she gets home, much is revealed in her delightful book.  A refreshing intimately honest portrait of a funny and successful person.  She makes you feel like a friend who she expects to follow her into that changing-room of life, and just keeps yakking about herself while she removes those pants.  It`s not sexy, not glamorous or hip; just refreshing that a real person can still be real, reach success, and live and write to tell about it.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game would be fun if they weren't trying to get money out of you every ten seconds.  You have to link it with your facebook account and pester your friends for lives.
0880796863|4.0|Quality cards. I thought the images were clear and colors were perfectly acceptable. The backs of the cards had a nice design with no company logo. The cards have a nice finish and are easy to shuffle. The accompanying book does have tiny print, but if you have good eyes or great glasses, you'll find the information useful. I'm happy.

B000WMFZMY|4.0|Academy award nominations: Set Design, Original Score and Song--The Falcon and the Dove.    March Boy nominations: Original Score-Miklos Rozsa    Wins: Costume Design, Set Design, Cinematography and Song--The Falcon and the Dove.    El Cid is a 1961 medieval epic based on the legends of Rodrigo de Bivar, the Spanish warrior who fought for the Spaniards and Moors during the 9th century. It was directed by Anthony Mann and stars Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren in the leading roles.    Charlton Heston is one of my all-time favorite actors. He brings just the right amount of warmth and range to his roles. I don't see why so many professional critics think he was a bad bad actor and that his Oscar win for Ben-Hur was one of the judges' worst decisions. I thought he was fiery and intense and subtle and quiet at just the right moments. His love for his mother, sister and fiancé, faith in God and hatred for Messala was so strong and real and he brought layers of details to the role. Every performance I've seen (The Greatest Story Ever Told, Ben-Hur and El Cid.) is a gem. He always plays strong, devoted, courageous men and that's why I love him. His Rodrigo is a warrior of uncompromising integrity. Throughout the film, he treats even the people that wronged him (King Alfonso, Princess Urracca, Count Ordonez and even his wife at one point) with kindness, loyalty and friendship. Each one of these individuals is baffled as to why he would do such a thing.    Sophia Loren's performance as Rodrigo's wife Chimene is a little uneven. There are times when she goes into self-conscious frowns and says her lines like she was sight reading the script but she gets better as the movie progresses. Her first few scenes are rather dull and passive but I think the scene where she and Rodrigo are in the barn was well done and the part where she tells Alfonso off at the convent \\"Would you punish the man who is Spain's only hope? It takes more than courage to be a king.\\" was good too. Probablyher finest moment is towards the end of the first half where she begs her husband's forgiveness for trying to murder him. The resonance in her voice and look on her face (especially her eyes) says a lot.    Herbert Lom is terrific as the Islamic terrorist, especially in his first scene at the beginning of the movie. Frank Thring is very good in his very short part as the cowardly Moorish king Al Kadir. Raf Vallone (Count Ordonez) makes the slow gradual transformation from a back stabbing traitor to a loyal friend. John Fraser is excellent as the cruel, prideful, power-hungry King Alfonso and Genevieve Page as his sister Urraca should have had more than a few lines.    The art direction/set design and costumes are magnificent, particularly the interior of the convent and palaces and what were the Academy smoking giving those awards to West Side Story instead? Robert Krasker's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Miklos Rozsa's music contains beautiful melodies and rich orchestration. He is definitely award worthy but he had already won Best Original Score for Ben Hur two years ago so it's understandable the Academy wasn't going to award him again so soon.    All in all El Cid is fine, solid entertainment and at times inspiring.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first book, liked the second, and found the third book to be a disappointing read. The writing is juvenile, and the story is boring, and predictable. I just did not care how it ended.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Fantastic app, does just about everything you could ask for. Search, plans, study plans, community, shared notes. Its great!<br /><br />So, why only 3 stars?  I send in multiple error and bug reports for each release.  Most get fixed right away.  However one glaring issue continues to be ignored.  Low light settings needs to be configurable to all of the application, not just reading scripture.  For myself, this is critical as I suffer from frequent migraines and being subjected to excessively bright white screens in between reading scripture accessing the application during one is torture to immerse myself in this apps functionality.<br /><br />- 1 star for not fixing low light settings through out the app<br />- 1 star for not addressing this issue over the past year of reported emails.<br /><br />Love this app, except for the reasons above.

0670026557|3.0|Adam Grant is apparently one of the best business school's best professors (and so young too!) so I have to bet that the framework in this book is an over-simplification of research that I am not privy to because I didn't hunt down the notes.<br /><br />The framework is this: there are three kinds of people in this world.  You have givers, matchers, and takers.  You see that the matchers are more transactional in their work environment, takers will just walk all over you, and givers are free with their time and expertise.  The counter-intuitive turn here is looking at the amount of success each group attains.  Matchers and takers populate the middle, but you find givers at the least successful end being walked all over.  You also find the giver at the successful end, where they have gathered so much goodwill and a vast social network because they give so much.  It's like a secular prosperity gospel.<br /><br />The rest of the book is padded out with anecdotes about some of these successful givers.  We see their paths and then want to emulate them.  I think I had higher expectations, because the thing feels padded to me, and the book is only 250 pages with average spacing.  The evidence of the successful giver is anecdotal, and I felt that there was never a systematic look at how to be the right kind of giver, who falls on the positive end of the distribution.  There's some advice, but it feels general to me be adaptable (195); don't fall into a pattern of selfless giving (172); volunteer for unpopular tasks and offer feedback (75).<br /><br />I didn't mark it, but I got the sense in one passage that you had to give because you wanted to give and thus create this positive karma that would come back to you like some of the people he highlights in the book.  If you gave because you wanted to create that karma, you become a matcher and thus not available to the karma.  It struck me as a paradox, because a natural giver wouldn't even be reading this book to try to be a giver.  This book seems to be for matchers or takers in Grant's paradigm, who want to be better by being proactive about being  a giver.  It reinforces the potential giver into a functional matcher.  Maybe I'm wrong.<br /><br />One final thing that I felt was unaddressed was a person's ability to change.  In the book, I felt that once you are identified by one of the three categories, you are there forever.  Oddly, there is a website set up that seemed to imply that change across categories was possible, something I wanted to see in the book.  The site had  a quiz to identify what group you belonged in.  I had read the book, and each question had only three possible answers so the \\"right\\" answer was obvious.  I answered as truthfully as possible, and was labeled a matcher.  I think I knew this by the first chapter.  Perhaps that's why I was hostile to the title.  What I liked though was that the quiz allowed nuance.  I am a majority matcher with taker tendencies.  I also have giver elements.  For example, I often write uncompensated reviews for books.iver.

B0027MJU00|5.0|A very interesting novel, and a page turner. Ending was surprising and definitely not expected. Another amazing story by Gillian Flynn
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought this was kinda fun. a little too easy though. the puzzles are a little to easy to figure out.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Good book great movies. Suzanne Collins is a great author.  And all that other stuff what you expect from a nice book
B000002J1Y|2.0|In 1973 when this album was released, I loved it. Thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread (at least until ELP's &#34;Welcome Back My Friends.........live set). In 2013, having not listened to this album in at least 3 decades, I was shocked to realize the performances were strewn with all sorts of musical narcissism in the form of needless solo excursions from Wakeman, Squire, and Howe. The recording itself could benefit from not just a remaster, but perhaps even from a slight remix. Nothing drastic, just some work on track eq and dynamics.<br />But compared to other live albums from this era such as The Dead's Europe '72, The Band's Rock Of Ages, and The Allman Brothers Live At The Fillmore East, Yessongs just doesn't hold up as well. Unless you're a diehard fan, you'll probably get better mileage from The Yes Album, Fragile, and Close To The Edge.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|The Free Dictionary has become my essential tool for all manner of mobile reading & writing on laptop, Kindle, and cell phone. Only rarely have I been unable to find a word or phrase duly listed (admittedly \\"unfair\\" tests on my part of truly obscure, foreign words or antiquated English words), while historical events, biographical entries, and proper nouns of every description have illustrated Wikipedia-like entries with html links to related topics.  The Free Dictionary will never replace my Oxford (OED) of course, but for a few MB of memory and free-of-charge to acquire in the App Store, the FD is incomparably easier to travel with (and I have the mere two-volume, 5000 page - guess-timate- and 20-odd lb.version of the OED), and increasingly  gets the more frequent day-to-day workout at home too.  Highly recommended for writers, travellers, scholars and students (at all levels from high school to grad school), business and government workers.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The characters were believable and written in an engaging manner.  The story line is easy to follow and leaves you feeling good at the end of the day

B00B2DSK06|5.0|What a great movie! This is a great mvie for both kids and grown-ups! So happy that Amazon sells Pixar!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This attorney/courtroom drama is filled with interesting characters and intrigue that paces itself well with a sly humor but doesn't let itself get silly. As an attorney myself I am often skeptical of courtroom drama because the law takes a back bench to the drama (no, Tom Cruise, you don't get to scream at Jack Nicholson at the top of your lungs while cross-examining him!). But Suits has fooled me a number of times, and just when I point out to my partner that the lawyers in the show can't do something because its a breach of ethics or contrary to standard court rules, etc., I am surprised to see that the script takes note of these deficiencies and uses them to move the plot forward (except, filing a patent DOES require a specially licensed attorney). Finally, the flirtatious romance between Mike and Rachel is really well played by the actors - subtle but pervasive. All around this is an entertaining series that I highly recommend.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|That was a cute and fun movie! Said some things out loud that go with entering your 40s but rarely get called out. It helps to laugh at things and this movie keeps you giggling.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Love this app, it's very fun. I highly recommended it for all ages. I find myself playing it whenever I log into my kindle.
B000YKE87W|5.0|What a marvelous - no, superb - tenor!  Depth and breadth of feelings expressed - incredible.  He's different sounding from my other favorite tenor - Fritz Wunderlich - but, nevertheless absolutely beautiful in his expression and vocal quality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You can't doze off with this game,or you will loose all those coins and gifts.So play and collect all those COINS.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book was fantastic. Like many others in the reviews, I was hesitant about the book's 5 start rating for a new author. Do not be. This book told a well thought out and intricate story. I could not put this book down. I will be looking for more books by this author in the future.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First off, let me state that I am not a techie at all.  I was consider buying an Apple TV or Roku but wasn't sure of how much I would use them or for what.  I was looking for something to use for Netflix mainly and I'm very happy I went with the less expensive Google Chromecast.  Besides being a much less expensive option, it was very easy to set up and install (if you even want to call it that,) has worked nearly flawlessly since I've had it, and overall has just been great having.<br /><br />The only thing I've noticed as an issue is when someone else is surfing the internet it might have trouble keeping up or re-buffering, but that happens very little.  I can stream Netflix right from my iPhone and it plays right away.<br /><br />Overall, depending what your needs are, this thing is great.  Cheap, easy to use and overall great value.
B00BPLGBRY|3.0|The original songs are great.  Akon and the black Eyed SUCKS ruined the &#34;bonus tracks&#34;. It's not worth the extra money. I had no idea they were on the bonus tracks.

1439152810|5.0|Well written and engaging story that moves from the present to past, and back, to tell the story of mothers and daughters and wives and friends. Really a surprising ending that made perfect sense to me once I reached it. Believable and detailed with interesting characters.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Truly beautiful read.  One of those books one would mourn the end of, because of its brilliance- both in insight and in creativity.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This was a spectacular ending to the series. It falls in line perfectly with story so many have come to love so much. It most certainly won't disappoint.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|what a cute story with a twist it worked out really nice but the twist are worth the read definitely worthy
B003QP4NPE|4.0|I'll start by saying that I really liked this book, and in fact, was hooked completely for the first 3/4s of it.  The concept is fantastic and original, the narrative is solid ... but unfortunately in the last act of this book, things start detouring from what made the beginning so good.<br /><br />Ostensibly, this book is a current day concept sci-fi centered around the autonomous actions of an incredibly advanced non-AI computer intelligence.  It's a distributed, trigger-event sensitive program, a so called \\"daemon\\" in tech jargon ... so far so good.  This Daemon is set forth upon the world when a genius computer mogul dies, and at first, the book appears to just be a murder mystery novel with the twist of the murderer being already dead, and the murders committed by an unfeeling, uncaring computer program.  But it quickly develops into much more than that ...<br /><br />The initial concept of this book requires something of a suspension of disbelief.  At first, things seem plausible enough.  But about halfway through, it becomes clear that the Daemon is something that could not possibly exist in the current day tech world (and this book was written in 2006).  Anyone who is a child of the digital era knows by now that no computerized machine can be trusted to do anything involving a boat-load of variables, ESPECIALLY if those variables occur over a lengthy period of time AND involve interaction with humans in the context of the real world.  Going into detail might ruin the suspense and mystery of \\"Daemon\\" ... but suffice to say, you should go into the novel not expecting this to follow real-world machine intelligence very closely.<br /><br />Other than that, the book has a strong opening, strong middle that keeps changing the nature of the mystery, and making it clear that things are more than they seem ... but then the book takes a sharp and unexpected turn from \\"current day concept sci-fi\\" to \\"near-future sci-fi\\" ... and maybe not even \\"near-future\\".  Specifically, even though almost all technology featured up to this point (other than the Daemon itself) is in-use real-world or protype technology, in the last act of the book, the author suddenly introduces various bits of fantastical sci-fi technology.  There's an explanation for this ... sort of ... but the jarring departure from one genre to the other makes this unpleasant ... especially when one of these technologies is something straight out of \\"Terminator: Salvation\\".<br /><br />All told, it's a good book, and I recommend reading it ... but the misleading first half of the book (which is fantastic) that gets followed by a genre-switching second half makes the book far from perfect.  Just go into the book with an open mind.ly, even though almost all technology featured up to this point (other than the Daemon itself) is in-use real-world or protype technology, in the last act of the book, the author suddenly introduces various bits of fantastical sci-fi technology.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|What an amazing book one of Kings best!!!! Love the way the story unfolds. Another masterpiece by King. A must read for all King fans.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|This was a long awaited treat.  It is one of the most original series depicting the many Viking sagas, and legends.  I ordered it because I could only catch bits and pieces when the series ran on the History Channel.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Seems to actually work like it says it does, calibrating my schedule with Google calendar with Kindle.  Just the fact that software works at all garners 4 stars in my world.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Nicely written about a time when orphan children in the early 1900's were transported and dropped off to adoptive parents in different area homes across the country. An eye opener!
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Not bad, but not as good as the first.  Are sequels ever good as the first?  Maybe the Godfather, if you like movies that idealize idiot thugs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is hilarious.  I highly recommend it for passing time.  The action gets quick very soon.  I hope for a sequel soon.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Works pretty well, but the radar part is cumbersome.  Just got a different radar app for radar.  Why is that part so hard?
0394818237|4.0|At first I didn't like this book. I thought it was too busy and cluttered when I skimmed over it. But I read one part one night and actually loved it. My daughter (3 and half at the time) was totally engrossed as I read the parts explaining what was illustrated and asked her questions about what she saw.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Well, if you have a lot of time and like meddling endlessly trying to make software work, this is the app for you.  I never got it to work right and gave up.  Just an annoyance.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the most entertaining game ever.  A must have for the gamer of any age.  Keeps the mind alert and functioning.
B0037VNX44|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 20 times now. It's got that &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; feel to it and it is totally enjoyable. The music is fantastic and I think this is Tom Hardy's best role. He is just perfect as Bronson, England's more notoriously angry, psychotic, prison escapee. It's dark and humorous and I absolutely loved this film. I don't know if it's for everybody, but if you like A Clockwork Orange, Trainspotting, or even Drive, I think you'll love this film.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Doesn't go in depth but is well written and a great place to start. With a low price this is a good bargain.
B007OUINLC|3.0|I feel like this movie was trying really hard to be interesting but kind of goes nowhere. It's more of a series of events with not much of a plot. Then it just ends. I feel that is was severely lacking, and I really wanted it to be better. It's interesting, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wifey got me hooked. Just wished u got more than 5 turns. I guess u gotta pay the bills somehow
0385743564|4.0|No Spoilers!<br /><br />I found this book to be very enjoyable. I was unaware that it was categorized as a \\"Teen\\" book until after I started reading it. I would never read a \\"superhero\\" book, but after reading the Preface of this book you are hooked. This is the first Brandon Sanderson book I've read. Immediately after finishing this book, i picked up Brandon Sanderson's \\"The Way of Kings\\". I really enjoy the way he writes. The book is fairly simple in concept. The characters and plot are not overly complicated. Overall it is a fast, enjoyable, light, entertaining read.
B003O8L9B4|3.0|The show is good enough and I would most likely watch it again. The Biggest Problem I had with it is that I was watching it with my daughter and had to get up quickly to turn it off, in &#34;Day One&#34; there is a bathroom sex scene that is completely inappropreate for young children. My daughter watched every Dr Who episode and is a big fan, nothing inappropriate just a little creepy. It would have been nice if they had a heads up 'sexuality content' disclaimer. She has watched PG-14 shows and I have never had to turn the show off before this. To be honest I wish I could yell at someone about it.
B00C6BACF4|4.0|The best part of this movie for me comes with the special features, where they acknowledge the plot holes and attempt to explain them instead of just hoping people forget it. It's the icing on top of an already fantastic cake. Plus, steelbook art, how could I pass this up?
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was afraid to read this because of the negative reviews, but I had to find out for myself.<br />I have to say that I loved this book, although I felt that it was a little rushed towards the end.<br />I knew what was going to happen because some reviews that I read did not warn of spoilers before reading this book.<br />It helped me cope with the ending.<br />Spoiler Alert!!!<br />Of course Tris was not going to let her brother walk to his death.  The ending makes perfect sense to any sister that has a brother.  Generally speaking, the sister will sacrifice herself for the brother because we all know guys are kind of clueless!!!  Sorry guys.<br />I enjoyed this book & I recommend this to all who are emotionally mature enough to appreciate this book!!!!!
B00C6B8EJK|4.0|Hot Fuzz is a perfect send-up/homage to all blockbuster action movies. The references are sharp, the satire is in no way mean spirited, and the fact that Pegg and Frost played as far against their Shaun of the Dead alter egos that it seemed fresh instead of a rehash of the former chemistry. The steelbook artwork is fantastic as well, this was definitely a great purchase.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I play almost every day.  An adicting game!  Waiting for updates and hoping for more challenges.  Patience is important to avoid spending money.tt
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As many reviewers have pointed out, this is an amazing book.  I'll just add my thoughts as to the audio CD version.  I've listened to many audio books over the years and this is among the best in terms of production.  Kate Rudd, as the reader/performer, comes across as extremely authentic and compelling both when voicing the female and male characters.  You are never distracted by anything (e.g., poorly done accents, voices not sounding age-appropriate, etc.) so you can be fully engaged in listening to the story.  And, in contrast to some CDs, &#34;The Fault In Our Stars&#34; has convenient tracks so that if you have to stop during a CD, you can easily find your place again without having to replay long segments.  Also useful is that each disc starts with the disc number and the last couple of lines from the end of the prior disc.  Not all CDs do that so I really appreciated the easy continuity.  There are 6 discs that run a little over 7 hours listening time but there is so much character development taking place that it doesn't feel too short.  This is one book that I really think gains a lot from being put into audio format.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a great game for all ages it never gets boring :-) my son loves it and so do my brother's
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|I wasn't around when Lincoln was alive -- taking a peek at the Guinness World Record for the oldest human, it looks like no one else living today was -- but my guess while watching this film:  people back then weren't nearly as talkative as the players in this film.  After all, as I believe Lincoln even says during the first act:  \\"I'm not really into politics myself.\\"  And politicians like to talk, while apolotical people tend to be less loquacious.  People back then were doers, not talkers.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not usually a fan of period pieces, as revisionists seemingly either try to not stomp on the graves of those in an earlier period, or they trounce on them and spit on them as well.  There are some exceptions, and one director that I think does a terrific job with period pieces:  Mel Gibson.  Yeah, I know that he's been the kicking boy du jour for surely more than a day.  But Mr. Gibson doesn't like to sugarcoat anything in any way in an unrealistic manner, and he seems to realize the fallibility of human nature, while at the same time showing some bit of dignity where he can and may.  (For those who are snarky, I'm sure that their real-mature response might be something like:  \\"Takes one to know one.\\")<br /><br />Another trait of many of Mr. Gibson's films:  he wasn't afraid to use the native tongue of the people at the time, and add subtitles for the viewer.  Surely a risky move for particularly a US audience, but I always thought that there was a huge payoff because of this; it adds to the authenticity.  But here, while the players speak in English -- as you'd expect, since after all it is set in the United States -- most of the people didn't exactly have the accents that I would expect.  This still would have been, say, within 100 years of the Birth of America, and the living at that time weren't too far removed from the initial immigrants.  (I like the television show \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" and the male lead in that film is far more convincing to me than anyone in this film.  Once again, I wasn't around back then, but my gut tells me \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" might be more accurate.)<br /><br />One other \\"touchy\\" subject, but not one you'd expect with this film:  many people, particularly those in the industry, are very afraid to ever criticize anything in which Steven Spielberg is involved.  \\"Hogwash!\\" I say, while adding, \\"A work of art stands strictly on its own.\\"  Mr. Spielberg has had many successes, and he's had some big failures as well; I always believe that those that don't have big failures don't take enough risks, and I commend him for taking the risks that he does.  \\"Jurassic Park\\" excellent, \\"Jurassic Park 2\\" a dismal failure.  \\"Indiana Jones\\" awesome, \\"Indiana Jones 2\\" awful.<br /><br />While I'm not prepared to bucket \\"Lincoln\\" in with the failures listed above, I would say that it's surely not a huge success.  And the worst thing of all to me:  it's just not very interesting.  While I don't believe that Lincoln is rolling in his grave over this film, I think that if he were to see it, he might just shrug and go back to sleep.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ive been reading this trilogy since Divergent first came out. However, Allegiant tested me mentally more than any other book has ever. Tears poured down my face for about the last 5-7 chapters. It ripped my soul out and shoved it back in. A must read, it was absolutely mind blowing and soul wrenching.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|EVERYONE should watch this movie. I got my 4 teenagers to watch it, and after the usual initial complaining, once they got started, they sat through the whole thing. They were dumbfounded. It kept their attention without being &#34;preachy&#34;. I think kids smell baloney when grown-ups are exaggerating or being overly dramatic, it turns them off. This movie does the opposite. I am an MD with an Anti-Aging and Weight Loss practice, so I recommend the movie to my patients all the time. I live in an area where the grocery stores don't carry grass-fed beef, never mind the butcher shops. This movie inspired me to find sources of good, grass fed meats, and free range chicken, direct from a farm co-op. It shows you the scam behind the labeling in our supermarkets. I believe, as do most doctors in my field, that we are nutritionally depleted and over-fed, not unlike the cows you see in this movie. My patients come in with so many digestive problems, so much inflammation in their own systems, so much stress, so many allergies, they can't lose weight... they all think it's somehow their fault. They believe TV commercials. They believe they can eat like their parents did. This movie shows them that our food supply is nothing like it was when we were kids. It shows the way our centralized government and lobbyists control what we eat in a way that would be impossible to do in places like Europe, where there is no one government, and hence, no real lobbying going on that would affect the entire continent. Perhaps this is the real reason why &#34;French Women Don't Get Fat&#34;.  I wish we could get schools to show &#34;Food, Inc.&#34; in their &#34;Health&#34; classes. I doubt it would be considered politically correct, but I feel that middle schoolers would benefit much more from watching this in class, than watching their teacher show them how to put a condom on a banana. My boys still laugh about that. Unbelievable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham seldom fails to keep me on the hook.  His character development is flawless.  The story line keep me up at night, wanting more and more.  A wonderful tale of redemption.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This book is another well written historical novel by the very talented author, Christoph Fischer. I was eager to read this book after finishing [[ASIN:B00CLL1UY6 Sebastian (The Three Nations Trilogy)]]. I learned a lot about the difficulties Jews faced under Hitler's reign. The story is set in Bratislava in 1933. I immediately identified with Greta, the young Jewish girl, because she loved to read books. Just like Greta's family, my family also believes I read too many books.<br /><br />Greta fell in love with Wilhelm, a Catholic bookseller. The young lovers secret meetings in the barn soon resulted in a baby boy named Karl. After a second pregnancy ended in miscarriage, Wilhelm fell out of love with his young wife. Greta soon became pregnant for the third time. Jews were being persecuted in Germany. Using that as an excuse, Wilhelm made secret plans to take Karl out of the country. He left the very pregnant Greta behind, and she soon gave birth to another baby boy, Ernst.<br /><br />Greta remained on the farm with Wilhelm's family for awhile, not realizing Wilhelm had divorced her. After Johanna, Wilhelm's evil and conniving sister, told the poor girl the truth, Greta was sent back to her own family. Life became very hard on the farm with the war going on, food shortages, and the continuing persecution of the Jews. The family struggled to survive while the war was going on. For me, this book was a very eye opening read about the trials and tribulations of people halfway around the world, in an era and a country I have not experienced personally. The book especially interested me since my father served in Germany at the end of World War 2. He brought home some memorabilia that I was always curious about as a child.
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|I have read two of his books now and I wonder how valid my observations are.  Although engaging fiction, I am reading the book from my own point of view, and from a very different cultural perspective.  I am reading thinking that these people want to share my values, and I am not sure that would be the case.  As someone else said, the author manipulates me by basing the book on the western sensibility.  That makes it almost impossible for me to assess the actions of the characters, and \\"like\\" or \\"dislike\\" all the things they do, or are forced to do.  I just end up sort of confused many times.  BUT they are good reading on a simply story level.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Took me a while to get into it, but it had such great reviews, I knew I needed to stick with it. The characterization is very well done and it's refreshing to see characters who veer from the norm in books.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app! I'm always on it, trying to learn more songs! I'm so happy that I got it! It is definitely worth getting if you are looking for a really good app to teach you piano.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The dvd is in perfect condition. I truly appreciate  it.My husband will love it on Christmas morning. Thank-You very much
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The auther is one of those few talented writers who writes in such a way that you become part of the story and see and feel what the characters are experiencing.
B00GFJ0NGQ|5.0|AMC is on a roll... First \\"Breaking Bad\\" and then the \\"Walking Dead\\"; Keep it up, and hopefully you guys will do Stephen King's \\"The Dark Tower\\" Series!  We should only hope!
B000U0O9FM|4.0|This is a total allegory - a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one. It points to the sense of self we have lost with throwing out spirituality with religion, with embracing materialism and stuff in place of seeking deeper meaning.<br /><br />The main character speaks volumes when he say s is a \\"30 year old boy\\". Never initiated into manhood by a community of men, never mentored by a father who did not provide a healthy rolemodel for wht a mature man looks like or behaves. The results are Fight Club. Lost adult-boys trying to find meaning without mentors, elders, or a moral compass.
0061124958|5.0|I read this book when I was 9 years old & now I am 44 years old. I wanted my 7 year old daughter to read & she is crazy about it. She is even reading it to her class everyday & they are loving it. Its a beautiful story of friendship that transcends generations.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Love this game. New challenges plus history tidbits make it enjoyable. Learning curve has a couple of bumps though....like jumping...and a few other newbie skills I was surprised at needing to learn after the fact. Hint: flick up to jump over obstacles, and read the mission requirements.
006202406X|1.0|I read the first two books in about three days. I couldn't put them down. I was so excited to read the end of the trilogy that my husband agreed to hang with my kids so I could read the day away one Saturday. He noticed pretty quickly that I kept showing up downstairs to see what they were up to, a clear sign that I'm bored with my book. I stumbled my way through the end over a weeks time, but found myself constantly tuning the story out. The end was an obvious giveaway the moment I opened the book with the POV changes. I mean, why else suddenly switch back and forth? I agree with many others who said it was hard to tell the difference between the Tris and Tobias. I too had to keep flipping back to remind myself. I had planned to re-read the series again soon, but I think I'll pass. Time to get ack to the brilliantly written Mysteriuos Benedict Society series, which I put on hold to read this.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I have become quite a fan of Jonathan and Charlotte since stumbling upon their YouTube videos. I purchased both of their CDs and listen to them daily on my long commute. This second album clearly shows how both of their voices have matured and I never get tired of listening to these two kids. In an industry not known for class, character, and integrity watching these two kids with true class, character, and integrity succeed is very heartwarming. I highly recommend both CDs and their YouTube videos are well worth watching. I am anxiously and hopefully waiting for their third album.
B0091THDOM|5.0|This Snugg Iphone 5 Leather case is just perfect.  I have another Snugg case (black) without the extra sleeve for credit card and such, and it fits just perfect with a small leather strap to pull which lifts your phone a couple of inches and can easily be removed and used.  The first one I received was too snug and the manufacturer was kind enough to send me a replacement.  I love this new Snugg Leather case in \\"distressed\\" brown.  Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|that I can finally play this fun and addictive game on my kindle :) :) I actually accidentally downloaded a manual thinking it was the game once lol!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I stumbled across this book and it's the best I've read this year - and I've read a lot of really good books!!  I will read more of JoJo Moyes' books based upon the beauty of this one.
B000002VMD|5.0|God bless Whitney Houston. Whatever frailties she had in life, cannot be matched to her audacious singing, and acting abilities in this movie. Along with Kevin Kostner, these two are a match made in Heaven. I love the entire movie, but Whitney's voice in singing the music adapted for this movie, is outstanding. I could just listen to her all day. Although we have lost her, she was, and still is a tremendous actress, and one of the greatest singers we have ever been blessed with. R.I.P Whitney.
0316055433|5.0|I loved this book and, like so many who have read it, didn't want it to end and will continue to think about it for a long time. Theo Decker is a young man who is stricken by an existential depression after the sudden brutal death of his mother and abandonment by his father. This kind of depression is not biochemical and may be more common in the gifted student characterized by a unique sense of hopelessness and a feeling that life is without meaning. He goes through his life underachieving and trying to self medicate with alcohol and drugs. His only hope is a work of art that may keep alive, for him, the memory of his beloved mother. He is a character in the tradition of the existential philosophy that humans find meaning in life through our own choices. We are free to do that and therefore responsible for our own misery or happiness. Theo is a victum of random events, but is tied to a work of art that gives his life some chance of meaning.
B004CGUC06|5.0|Great Product.  I really like what Criterion has done with these classics! Very good.. super high quality. I just wish Dolce Vita was out in Blu-ray here.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Very interesting storyline!  My daughter had seen it 3 times so I decided to watch it and I wasn't disappointed.  It's very scary without all the blood.  Whenever a movie states it's based in true facts there is an elevated sense of  fear and excitement.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a Roku and bought this to  supplement it. Chromecast is great! One thing I didn't know, I can cast my entire desktop to the TV, so I use this to show others when they ask how to do something with a computer.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was a huge fan of the first two books but this one was disappointing.  I was Not a fan of the ending.  I enjoyed the series but I would have liked a different ending.
0736430512|5.0|My daughter and I love reading this book. The movie hasn't come out yet, and I wanted to get an idea of the story line before we see the movie. I think this story is really cute.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is absolutely amazing it's so fun I can rarely stop playing my only complaint is that the prices are waaaaayyyy too high fir characters and boards other than that it's a great time
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Tragic ending to the greatest little TV-mystery-teen-drama show in the last 10 years. The third season of VM leaves us with many unanswered questions but is probably the strongest of the three. You will love this season until it ends, but good news! Thanks to Kickstarter and crowd sourcing Veronica Mars fans are going to get the answers they want. The movie is slated to come out in 2014. DON'T watch the trailer until you've finished the series. DO watch the series before the movie comes out. If you liked the OC or Gossip Girl or any of the ridiculous teen dramas on the WB/CW networks...you will LOVE Veronica Mars. Watch it. You won't regret it.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|I will be completely honest. I struggled with this book and found it tedious to wade through. The description and other reviews made this seem like something up my alley but I really don't think this book was for me. Normally I would just drop a book if I found it too boring but I really wanted this to be good. I love the core concept of Universes being linked and how when an evil impacts one its influence is felt in the other. I also really liked that this wasn't a teenage romance novel because some of the basic elements fall in line with what is popular in that genre.<br /><br />The college experience and attitude of new freshmen was very well captured and it was nice. Not enough stories seem to pick that age group to target and it was different. I feel that most of the characters felt unique and had their own little quirks but we never really got to know them that well. The character development was shallow and often times character elements and troubles would be glossed over in the narrative style.<br /><br />The narrative style is where my biggest complaint comes in. The book is told in a summary narrative, more like you're reading a summary of events rather than being a part of the events. Battles, drama, hardships were all quickly surmised and then the narrative would be on to summarizing the next thing that was happening. Now and again there were moments where you felt like you were within the neat world the author had created but they were too far in between.<br /><br />Next certain aspects of the story felt odd. People didn't seem to question enough of what was going on around them and readily accepted things too quickly. If one of my friends were to tell me that he was visiting another world I would think about looking up the nice white coat people's number just in case. That didn't happen, the main characters friends just accepted it. There is an art club that didn't really cover art but learning to fight with bo staffs, mental mind games and athletics. I did like the thought of the Echo Club though but felt that once again the interesting things were just summarized.<br /><br />The final thing that made this book difficult for me to read was the naming schemes. I like the fact that the author attempted to not go overboard with typical fantasy names but felt he went the opposite way and made the names to generic. Them and the Other In Between. It just was hard for me to read every time and I feel I would have preferred something a bit more unique even if it felt clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? It is difficult because I don't think it is without merit or horrible but it is not something I really liked. I could see others possibly liking this book and that is okay. Because of this I have created a new recommendation for my personal system. I call it sixes. My advice is to read other reviews and if you like what they say then pick it up and you probably won't be disappointed.I did like the thought of the Echo Club though but felt that once again the interesting things were just summarized.<br /><br />The final thing that made this book difficult for me to read was the naming schemes.

B003VVAE4W|5.0|Veronica Mars Season 2 continues the drama of our favorite wise-cracking-high-school-attending-super-sleuthing-single-childing babe Veronica. If you like The OC, Gossip Girl, One Tree Hill, Saved By the Bell or anything in that vein you will LOVE VERONICA MARS better. Trust me. The show is early 2000's dated for sure and the budget is low but these facts make the show even more lovable in many ways. I didn't love the main mystery involving the bus. There were moments in season two that made me wonder if the writers actually knew where they were taking the show ahead of time, but in the end it worked.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|love it thank you for this super fun app. I play it way way too much! off to my next level!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|For fans of television crime drama Broadchurch is required viewing. This show blowsThe Killing out of the water. It is a short, self-contained version of CSI or Law and Order but shot beautifully and casted perfectly. It takes 30-45 minutes to get used to the thick British accents but this short (8 45-min episodes) season is worth anyone's time. Definitely check it out.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|As a big Arcade Fire fan for the last several years, I have enjoyed all their previous albums (even most of \\"Neon Bible\\"), so I was looking forward to their new album, \\"Reflektor.\\" In my opinion, it's their worst album yet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The songs on this album are overly long and indulgent. I don't mind a 7- or 8-minute song here or there, but most songs on this album are either too long or feel too long.<br />- They went in a disco-sounding direction, which makes the lyrics difficult to hear<br />- One thing that made their previous album, \\"The Suburbs,\\" so well-done was how they built up energy and layers throughout the song. The \\"Reflektor\\" songs never achieve the climaxes that many of \\"The Suburbs\\" tracks do.<br />- Trite Orpheus/Eurydice references<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I have to give Arcade Fire credit for not remaking the same album time and again, the way many other bands do. \\"Reflektor\\" is different from all their previous albums, but this time the risk didn't pan out for me.<br />- Regine Chassagne gets more lead vocals than on prior albums, which is great<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying \\"Reflektor,\\" I'd give their eponymous single a listen before buying the whole thing. The title song is a good indication of what the rest of the album sounds like: disco-esque, long, and anti-climactic.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This is a very addictive game only problem. YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY! After almost going over my limit on my card though google. I QUIT at 100 levels. CALL ME BACK WHEN IT FREE!OR I CAN BUY THE GAME AND PAY NO ONE! :@
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|To many stops not enough action always prompting u to purchas something. Need more playtime better grafics and different music.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's forever long, but just as good as the movie if you can get through it! I happened to read the book the first time 20 years ago, and was thrilled to see the movie. I bought the book again after the movie.
B00009NHC5|5.0|the movie in itself is a classic thriller, that proves to be scary to this day.<br /><br />The dvd provides proper extras, such as trailers and a documentary with the surviving creative team and actor alan arkin. great translation on the subtitles to spanish (which is a major deal for me)
B002ZG999U|5.0|Sylvester Stallone is a guilty pleasure of mine, as is everyone else in this movie, so I have to say that I LOVE this movie!!! The shipping was fast and the dvd works great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very handy.  Like to check my math when handling figures.  Don't have to drag out a calculator and hope the battries have not died.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I LOVE this movie! If you like heist movies like the Ocean series then this is a movie for you! The shipping was fast and the dvd works great!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Great game, just hard enough to make it fun...do wish they were quicker in adding levels ....Great game to spend some free time
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well with my PC and my iPhone 4.  I'm disappointed that it only works with Hulu, Netflix and YouTube from the iPhone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for candy crush on my kindle and it's here. It's the same as my phone so no real problems. The only thing is that when i try to use one of my +3 it goes to the level down. But that happens on my phone to.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|This is my fourth Dan Brown book,and may be my last,as it seems with each one the violence gets more gruesome,and I do not recall any of the other three so full of profanity.I think it is an excellent engrossing white-knuckle read, but the violence was over the top for me.Far too gruesome and detailed and what especially bothered me~<br />was his writing the violence from the victim's first person POV!!!!I found that very disturbing and distressing,and don't want to go through that again!<br />:(<br /><br />I read my library's copy.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Was able to read e-mail attachments ( I frequently receive them) which I could not do before installing this on my Android Nook.
0385737955|5.0|The book the Maze Runner had a great start. I really liked the beginning when Thomas wakes up with out knowing anything but his name. It gives a sense of eagerness and mystery.  One of the major themes of this book is friendship. The fact that all the \\"gladers\\" are so close helping them to survive with the bonds they have created. Another thing I like about this book was how James Dashner truly brought out the thoughts and emotions in the characters. Through out the book, i was interested with every chapter I read. At some points in the book I felt as if I were a \\"glader\\" expressing some emotions i felt reading this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging!!!!!  Time passes so fast because of the challenge. The music can get a little old, but will put up with it for so long and then there is an option to turn off .
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all of John Grisham's books.  The characters become so real that the reader feels like you actually know them.
1780387105|5.0|This is a good tool to go along with the beginner guitar course. Justin really put some work into the whole package. He is a great instructor!

B006GECE9Y|4.0|Works well for what I needed it for. That is all I have to say.on this subject as of now.
B005LHO274|2.0|My problem with this app is the live feed. Everytime I try to use it I get a giant RED message saying \\"magnetic field detected!\\" Now, I of course become concerned being in a magnectic field and all so, I tap on the giant red warning and get nothing! So, I am unable to use the find me feature and I am trapped inside some kind of magnectic force field that this app will tell me nothing about! Any one else have this problem?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|love the movie and seeing it in 3d makes it even better great surround sound also, I a huge fan of all star trek
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has NKJV  for free! It has all the tools I want like a reading plan, bookmarks, a place for notes, sizing for comfort in reading. I really love this app.
B005VOXQ1U|5.0|Very lifelike, this is a well made toy.  My son really enjoys playing with it.  I highly recommend all of the Schleich animals, they are the best that I've seen on the market.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My second time reading this, and I still could hardly put it down. You should read this, too. I'm talking to YOU.
B00EWS5IO4|5.0|After waiting decades for this release, it is finally here!! The sound quality is excellent and Hendrix is @ his best for the early years. Jimi unleashes some outstanding blues work on Red House, Hear my Train and Hey Joe. My favorite is Hansen and Carlsen's Tax Free where Hendrix reaches through the clouds into outer space and Mitch is countering with his jazzy rat e tat Brilliance. Even though it is early Jimi and We've all heard these tunes over and over, Hendrix is really whaling on these numbers and I would highly recommend this CD
006202406X|3.0|I am barely giving this book 3 stars just because of the ending.  I had to force myself to read it most of the time.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Best game you start with 4 cars to choose from then you upgrade to faster cars and you drag race and make sure to check out CSR classics have fun playing the game
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Great movie, by far the best james bond movie to date with the exception of perhaps skyfall. Recommened to everyone
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Gave candy crush second chance but it is rigged. Can not play more than five minutes. Do not waste money!!!!!!!!!!  27 moves at 3000 points and it will only use 3. They blocked getting three stars and the game will shut down before giving you three stars. Do not waste money unless your stupid
B003O86MY8|5.0|Very good violinist and a must have CD for all violin players and fans. His music is very impressive and my daughter listens to David all the time.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I ordered this for my niece and she loves it! I purchased it for her birthday and it was the perfect gift.
B00CSYR432|5.0|Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki have made yet another amazing film!  I love the art style, the music, but most of all, the messages each film portrays has a touching and memorable meaning.  I cannot wait to see more and add them to my collection! :)
B00CXQL828|5.0|Most supergroup albums are either crap or one-offs that I couldn't care less if I hear from again.  The Winery Dogs is completely different.  Richie Kotzen is an amazing guitarist and has such a soulful voice - his solo work is excellent and worth checking out alone.  With the addition of Portnoy and Sheehan, all of the boxes get checked and you get an album full of favorites.  Can't wait to hear more from these guys!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, frustrating but fun. I spend a lot of sleepless nights on this game. Have not had it force shutdown like most games. I am happy.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|As soon as I did an &#34;Update&#34; of this app, all of my information was gone.<br />Worst money ever spent.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved it. The personal emotional dilemmas that Ender Wiggin wrestles with really make you empathize with the character. And Ender is great, so smart. The strategy and logic he uses in life, in his career, and in battle are fascinating. So much fun.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Great movie the case was not very protective  it just seemed unstable the case was just not very supportive but thx
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved all three books from this series.<br /><br />Being honest, I love a happy ending, and enjoy when everything is wrapped up nicely and the main characters can go off into the sunset and live their lives. That was not how this book ended. I was shocked at how abruptly Tris died and wanted nothing more than for it to not be true.<br /><br />I cried as I read the remaining chapters, and although I would have preferred a different ending, I truly enjoyed the book because as I read Four's emotions his reactions to Tris's death. aS I read Four's reactions to Tris's death, I couldn't help but put myself in his shoes and feel what he felt. I would not wish the pain of loss on anyone, but I enjoy the journey of following someone through that grief they experince because it is a reflection of that loss that shows how much that person truly means to you. It was that reflection of emotion that made me enjoy the book.<br /><br />I did feel that the book dragged at points, and I felt that while I was reading it that I didnt know where I would end up and how the story would be wrapped up by the end.
0316219266|4.0|I wasn't really planning on reviewing this book, because I was mentioned in it several times and it didn't seem appropriate.  But several other people who were also mentioned in the book have already posted reviews, and in fact, MacKenzie Bezos, in her well known 1-star review, suggested that other &#34;characters&#34; might &#34;step out of books&#34; and &#34;speak for themselves&#34;.<br /><br />I was at Amazon for the first 5 years of its existence, so I also have firsthand experience of those times at the company, and I have been a fairly close observer since I left. By and large I found Mr. Stone's treatment of that which I know firsthand to be accurate -- at least as accurate as it is possible to be at this great a remove, and with no contemporaneous documentation of the early chaotic days or access to certain of the principals.  Relying on people's memories of nearly twenty-year-old events is of necessity somewhat perilous.  Of course there are a few minor errors here and there, but I don't have firsthand knowledge of important mistakes much less anything that appears to be intentionally misleading.  But there are a few minor glitches.  In my case, I can testify that I did not, in fact, have a bushy beard at age 17 when I worked at the Whole Earth Truck Store & Catalog in Menlo Park.  It was a publisher and seller of books and other things, not a lending library.  It was in a storefront and was no longer a mobile service operating out of a truck by the time I worked there  (p. 32).  But I do not think this is a reason to disregard the entire book;  it's just some not terribly relevant detail the author got a bit wrong in a way that doesn't change the story materially.  MacKenzie listed one error, which didn't seem especially awful or material to me, and then referred only vaguely to &#34;way too many inaccuracies&#34;.  Without a more explicit list of mistakes it is hard to know what to make of that.  Breaking news:  a new 372 page book has some errors!<br /><br />Since Mr. Stone did not have access to Jeff Bezos for this book, but had to rely on previous interviews and the accounts of others, it would be surprising if there weren't a few mistakes regarding his thought processes.  As part of my agreement to be interviewed for this book, I was allowed to read a draft of the chapter which covered the time I was there, and I offered a number of corrections, some of which Mr. Stone was able to verify and incorporate.  To the extent I am quoted, my quotes are, while not complete, fair and in context.  I don't love or agree with everything that Mr. Stone wrote about me -- especially his broader conclusions regarding the circumstances of my departure from the company -- but I do think it was fair and reasonable.  I am aware of at least one other interviewee who was also given a chance to check over the chapter in which his story was discussed.  I obviously can't know this, but I suspect that if Mr. Stone had been granted access to Jeff Bezos, that he would have extended a similar courtesy.  I have a pretty high degree of confidence that Mr. Stone made a significant effort, and did what was in his power, to make the book accurate.<br /><br />The irony is, of course, that by reviewing the book as MacKenzie Bezos did, she has brought an immense amount more attention to it -- there are dozens of articles referring to her review via Google News this morning -- and its sales rank has shot up considerably.  The book is not a fawning hagiography, but it is also hardly a completely negative account either.  It describes not only Amazon's ultra-hardball business practices, but the better aspects of their services and products as well.  To the extent of my knowledge it is a pretty realistic account, though necessarily incomplete.  Of course Mr. Stone has his own point of view, and of course he does what nearly all biographers do, which is to impute thoughts and emotions to the people he writes about.  It would be mighty dull reading without that, but I think readers are generally smart enough to understand that when they read biographies, especially unauthorized biographies, the author has to recreate some kind of persona to make the subject appear life-like.  That doesn't make it fiction.  This was written as a business book for a popular audience anyway, not as an academic treatise, so expecting every &#34;Bezos thought...&#34; to be footnoted, or couched in hypothetical language, is not realistic.<br /><br />Especially in comparison to the sad collection of awful books that have been written on this subject, this one is much more detailed, more interesting, and a lot more deeply reported.  Sure, there is plenty more that could be written about, and maybe someday somebody will.  If and when that happens, I can only hope it is also &#34;unauthorized&#34; and not sanitized by a corporate PR department, and that some real investigative journalism is done, like Mr. Stone did here.hout that, but I think readers are generally smart enough to understand that when they read biographies, especially unauthorized biographies, the author has to recreate some kind of persona to make the subject appear life-like.

For those who have read the book, though, there are a few things concerning my role in this history that I would like to set straight very briefly.<br /><br />I reject Brad's conclusion that there was any necessary conflict between me staying in a job with enough direct responsibilities to keep me interested and Jeff's fiduciary duty to shareholders.  In my view that would have been a false choice, and it's really just Brad Stone's opinion. That's not how it really happened.  I also dispute Brad's statement that Amazon had only \\"one true parent\\", although I suppose that is a matter of semantics.  For one example, nobody else but me would wake themselves up several times a night in the early days, to make sure our systems were up and running, and drag themselves into the office regardless of the time if they weren't.  If taking care of the baby in the middle of the night is not a parent's job I am not sure what is.  Also, regarding that Hawaii surprise party:  I did not \\"grimace\\" through the entire weekend as Brad wrote (p. 63), though it is true Jeff's motivation for organizing it was not entirely clear given the circumstances at the time, and that it felt to me like a premature and un-requested going away party.  I enjoyed the time there with friends and family.  Though the weekend was a generous gesture on Jeff's part, I believe it signified a further separation of me from the company, that I was not ready for, even if it was already in the cards.  And one last thing -- my role in the early days was not just about creating \\"technical infrastructure\\", it was also about creating the first versions of Amazon's user experience on the web, among several other things.

B004EHZPEG|5.0|This book is wonderful and well worth the price.  The author has so many great insights into the various aspects of game design.  Not only are these insights very thought provoking, they are very enjoyable.  It is fun to read about all these perspectives for viewing game design.  I bought the Kindle version, and I'm glad I did.  There are a lot of pages so I imagine it would be a pain to carry around.  However, the images are hard to read.  Also, if you like to highlight paper, you need the real version.  There's a lot to highlight.
0792844882|5.0|wanted to see what the movie was about instead of renting and it was a nice movie to watch and enjoy
0316055433|4.0|As a huge fan of Donna Tartt, I was prepared to love this book. The quality of the writing did not disappoint. The novel opens extremely strong with evocative portraits of New York, but loses steam in Las Vegas. The novel could have used stronger editing. The story drifts along with the protagonist in the middle of the novel.  While Boris, Hobie, and others are characters that &#34;come alive&#34; through Tartt's writing, the protagonist, Theo, suffers from an inability to clearly understand him or to see him. At times, I found myself frustrated by his inarticulateness, which is ironic since Theo is extremely articulate about his thoughts, he is inarticulate when communicating with loved ones. The excessive self-destructiveness of Theo was a bit overdone and dragged on and on well after the point was made. The book seemed to drift endlessly from one drug/alcohol induced binge to another. Frankly, it got old and did not advance the narrative. While the book is still well worth reading,  I wish a kind editor would have seen fit to have tightened the story and edited out these repetitive &#34;lost soul to drugs/alcohol&#34; scenes. Theo suffers for these overdrawn passages as does the story. Boris is very likable (more likable than Theo) and at times I wonder, like Boris, why he puts up with Theo. I care less and less about Theo's fate as the book goes on. Theo's hopelessness and lack of backbone and ingenuity in the final third of the novel made me care less about him. His creativity and scrappiness, evident in the first half or so of the book makes him likable but Tartt disposes of his finer traits for an ennui that does not satisfy or interest. A book that is almost 800 pages needs a strong payoff at the end which Tartt tries to deliver but does so only half-heartedly. While the novel delivers from a plot standpoint, it fails on a character level. Theo does not receive the epiphany or redemption that we as readers have read hundreds of pages to receive, but rather,there is an abstract ending that is very cerebral rather than visceral. Theo seems to have changed little from his ordeal. He is like an emotional automaton. Perhaps Tartt's point is that the &#34;damaged&#34; can never be whole. Yet, for a character to hold our interest for nearly 800 pages, we need more than an emotional automaton. That being said, lovers of art, New York, beautiful writing etc will find this a Good read, just not a Great read.

B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is my favorite of all time. its so fun. and I love the way it re-shuffles. its great
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Amazing book. Danny Torrance is my new favorite King character. Danny struggles through out the story with one<br /> of the most difficult tasks known to man, self forgiveness. His story although fictional is truly inspiring. GREAT BOOK!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun. If you like Jewel Quest or Bejeweled, you will love this one. One warning, it is addictive.  If it wasn't for schedules and only so much battery power, I wouldn't stop.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is amazing and a little disturbing. It was a childhood favorite, and now I somewhat wonder why my parents let me watch this, but it was as expected.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|MUST HAVE for Steve Hackett/Genesis fans and anyone who loves Prog or Classic Rock...The packaging of this box set is beautiful and the best I have seen...If you could not make this tour, the DVD's are excellent, you will feel like you are there...For the money, the best music/video set I have bought in a long time!!!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is the bargain of the year...$52 for the Complete Columbo! I can hardly wait to renew my love affair with this great character! The series ,makes all of the Best lists...best dramas, best detective shows, best legal shows, most loved actors, etc. Oh, there's just one more thing.....the product description should say &#34;all 45 episodes from the 7 seasons and 24 movies for a total of 69 Columbo stories&#34;. The way they have it now is a bit less accurate and, dare I say, deceptive!
B00FANXZL8|5.0|The original The Next Day plus an EXTRA disc of 4 new studio tracks plus three tracks from the original Deluxe edition of The Next Day PLUS a bonus track (\\"God Bless The Girl\\") and 2 new re-mixes including \\"Lost In Love\\", a 10 plus minute epic (a MUST listen!)...The DVD contains the four music videos previously released online but seem better in total...This is the box set to get if you do not have The Next Day already and even if you do it is like buying a whole new album anyway.  Either way, great to hear the Chameleon again!!!
B004ZIHYXO|5.0|bad ass album! it's the uncensored and extra tracks CD. almost every song is awesome (nobody's perfect, but Pit chimes close :-P)
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story here is awesome with an interesting twist of events.  There were times, however, when an event or internal dialogue were a bit drawn out.  Hence, I found myself skipping or just skimming pages of the book.  However, given the topic, its setting and history, it is worthy of your reading.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I got a bunch of free download books to fulfill my obsession to have all the books. I haven't even opened it so I can speak to the formatting or content.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|The story is one of self-discovery, change and obsessions.  It was interesting to enter the mind of the main character to examine his perceived flaws and observations of how the world saw him.  At times, the story seems to drag a bit but, nonetheless, it was a cute story.
1444777556|5.0|Love the saga of James and Bob. Happy pet stories always warm my heart.....especially a man that loves a feline!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Beautiful and whimsical, yet deep enough to keep you engaged in conversation about it for hours without ever actually nailing it down.  Miyazaki is a masterful storyteller, and he tells an engaging and compelling story.  The sybolism and thematic questions and concepts that run throughout the film are on par with his other masterworks like Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Howl's Moving Castle, and the art adn story are accessible and appealing for adults and kids alike.  Just be warned, this world and mythology Miyazaki references doesn't exactly follow typical Western conventions.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great follow up to the shining. I love how horror has evolved from the things of nightmares to real things that if we focused on them should cause nightmares. Bravo, Mr. King!
B006LSZECO|2.0|You have to really follow the story line and stay with it. This doesnt capture your interest or hold it as it lacks any real depth. I didn't even finish it as it move me too.
B000W94FE6|4.0|shows what people enjoy naturally and why you have experiences that are more enjoyable than others-the most important part is that it shows you how to make other more mundane experiences more like the enjoyable ones-incredibly interesting
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was highly hyped and runs into a trilogy. I found it ok, but lacked the true feel of an S&M type relationship that can be found in other books of its type. If you like the latest hyped up books, this is for you. If you are a true fan of good erotica, give this a pass and look for something better.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Excellent sound quality and performance.  This *is* a soundtrack, so there are some extra sounds that won't make sense if you haven't seen the movie.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I will not spoil ANY part of this amazing and heart-wrenching book for you. Just turn off your phone, grab a HUGE box of tissues and be prepared to not be able to put this book down until the very last page. Those of you who throw the book at a wall will still pick it up again because you just HAVE to know. The aggravating, heartbreaking, infuriating love story of Alex and Aiden deserves it. And like all good love stories, the pain is worth it in the end. Such a great book and an all-time favorite series.
B00005UWMX|3.0|I didn't realize this was Region 2 until I went home and put it in my DVD player....boo. I'll just have to move to the UK to watch my Ladyhawke movie....yeah! I'm sure if I could watch the movie I would love it though.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Its a PS3 Dualshock 3. Why bother reviewing. It works as advertised and, in my experience, better than most OEM controllers.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant was a very good end to the Divergent trilogy. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it was a bit different from the two previous books. Lots of new characters and situations. This will be a good book for middle school aged kids to read, so long as they have a good grasp of reality. There is a LOT of violence, most of it for no good reason (ethically, it is necessary for the story). I think adults will appreciate the books as well. The way the characters react to situations is realistic and the ending is unexpected.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Coded to take your money.  Pure and simple.  I'd pay for the game and honesty.  Doesn't seem to exist with mobile fremium games.  Dishonest dishonorable game.  Wish I could give it negative stars.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|What a great movie.  The singing and music is very entertaining!  This quickly became my girls' favorite movie.  We watch it often!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|It's Tom Hanks. It's obvious. He's one of the best actors who ever lived. Period. One super great movie. Classic.

B002ZG98LO|2.0|Predators(released July/10)is a very luke warm addition to the Predator franchise by producer Rodrigues.It stars,among others,Adrien Brody,Topher Grace,Alice Braga,Walton Goggins,Danny Trejo and Lawrence Fishburne.Unless someone has a bit more imagination than this and the last group of writers of the series,then this franchise is essentially dead in the water.And what a shame as it has SO much potential.I thought at least Rodrigues would do a half decent job,but boy was I wrong.<br />The story starts as Brody is free falling to Earth.Just in time his parachute opens,but his landing is still a rough one.Eventually eight others join him.Some are former armed forces personnel but others range from a death row inmate to a doctor.None know why they are there or where &#34;where&#34; is.They wander around the jungle-like environment until they come to the edge of the forest and discover three planets in the sky.They are definitely not on Earth.It is soon after the group get attacked by dog-like creatures that sport deadly spikes.They manage to kill most of them,until the last ones are recalled back by a high pitched sound.Brody comes to the conclusion they are in a game preserve of sorts and they are the prey.<br />The group later enter a clearing in which they find a Predator tied up to a tall stake.Suddenly a bigger Predator attacks and the second victim from the group falls.Later in the jungle, Fishburne appears offering the group shelter.He takes them to an abandoned space craft where he has lived for about 10 years.He talks to an imaginary friend,but reveals that the predators have a feud going between the bigger and smaller ones.During the night he tries to kill the group,but Brody attracts the predators who kill Fishburne.They escape into the jungle and while fleeing three of the group die by sacrificing themselves and killing the same amount of predators.They go back to the clearing and cut down the small predator on the stake.Brody motions that he wants the predator to help them all escape by piloting the predator ship.The alien sets the ship on automatic pilot but then is killed by a larger predator.<br />While running to the ship, the doctor gets injured but Braga won't leave him.Brody carries on and appears to leave on the alien ship.The large predator sees the ship leaving and remotely blows it up.The doctor meanwhile has incapacitated Braga and is about to kill her when Brody shows up and saves her.Brody uses the doctor as bait(loading him with explosives)and lures a predator in,but the resultant explosion only stuns the predator.But it's enough for Brody to eventually get the upper hand and kill it.After the fight more people start parachuting in,as the scenario seems to be starting all over again.Brody tells Braga that they should keep looking for a way off the planet.Fade out.<br />Right,as if that will ever happen after what they have just been through!The plot is a meandering fiasco,is it goes from one pointless moment to another,and none of them generating any kind of excitement.Remember,we have had two other predator movies before,not counting the Alien VS series.We KNOW what they look like and how they hunt.In fact the only thing we didn't know was that there was an in-fighting thing going on between different parts of their species...big deal.Other than that,it was all old territory;the attack with their razor claws,their cloaking in and out,their mimicking of human speech,their ability to see in different light spectrum's,etc,etc.It is all been there,done that stuff;no originality in a truck load.There was a quick reference by Braga back to the first movie;said the Volkswagen about the Cadillac!Boy,how I yearned that this stinker was half as good as that.<br />Technically speaking this film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette,commentary and some prequel motion-comics.<br />In conclusion the Predator franchise continues to speed up in its downhill descent.The efforts by Rodrigues and his crew fail to slow its speed.This is a dull sequel that no more furthers the series than I do.2 1/2 - 3 stars.e efforts by Rodrigues and his crew fail to slow its speed.This is a dull sequel that no more furthers the series than I do.2 1/2 - 3 stars.

What twists and turns it had! Have already bought it in paperback for 3 friends as gifts! I am very critical of books so if I say it was good it has to be good!

B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's pretty action packed, the special effects are great, the acting and production values (i.e. lighting, editing, etc) were superb.  Every actor does a great job making this movie work.  Others have already commented on the storyline so I will just say that it is a great movie to watch in the evening with your significant other.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Perfect incandescent replacement! I have been trying a number of different bulbs to get the right white, and this one definitely does it for me! It is VERY bright, but not too white like many of the others. I bought two of these to slowly replace my 4 CFLs in the ceiling fixture in one bedroom. The bulbs were so bright that I never needed to replace the remaing two CFLs, I just leave those off!<br /><br />I plan on replacing many more bulbs with these as they are fantastic!

B00EVW0SA0|1.0|This movie had the makings of a hit and maybe get close to Olympus Has Fallen, just when you think it's getting good, they throw in some cheesy lines.  First they say, \\" call in Seal Team Six, then it's Delta Force then it's the Marines.  It just gets cornier by the minute..and bad post production misses like the geek white house tour guide gets a shotgun which he never uses and then later they show him going \\"back in\\" and cocking it again.. They also show him walking up to a terrorist and asking him to take it easy on the priceless artifacts, and then the tour guide beats a guy up with one.  Wasted my $4.99 on an at best \\"C\\" rated film..

I wanna know what happens with Charlie and witness him grow more and more. All in all a great coming of age story and awesome read for anyone battling their own demons. Five stars isn't nearly enough.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I have to admit, this did take me longer to read than I'd expected because it drags in some places. It's not a page turner, and it seems the movie, well, the only thing similar here to the movie is the title, which makes me wonder what the movie was actually based on. I'd recommend this book only to someone who is already a fan of the zombie horror genre because it's a weird read and not truly worth of the gushing reviews.

0061950726|5.0|Great book!!  It came in great condition!  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down!  Really makes you thankful for what you have and the family you have around you!
B00280LYIM|5.0|Love the series! I can't wait to read all of the books in the series. The movies are not as good as the books!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I've got a new respect for Eminem. I've liked a few of his songs over the years since his debut. When I saw him perform on the first YouTube Music Awards, I was amazed by his talent. He really is incredible, and I love the fact that he stays mysterious with his personal life. Too many artists have all their business out there for everyone to see these days. Eminem appears to be all about his art, and he seems to really care about his family. I appreciate you, Eminem, and I love the new album.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I really loved this book. I came very close to giving it 5 stars. But. At several points the book runs into the weeds at the edge of the road. There are a number of places where we just get too many details that don't contribute to the story. The other point is that there is a little too much speculation in the book. Bezos wasn't all that cooperative at points and the writer began to fill in the blanks with speculation about what Bezos might have been thinking. That's not a good thing.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I am using this over my washer and dryer in my garage and can't be more pleased at how well it is doing the job for which I bought it. I filled it with Enloop rechargeable batteries when I first put it up and have not yet needed to change them 3+ months since then.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Been a Stryper fan since the early 90's. This album is possibly their best yet. If you love real rock-n-roll you will not be disappointed! Tight, rocking riffs from Oz and Mike, Michaels vocals are as strong as ever yet more refined, awesome drumming from Robert and you can't miss Tim on bass! Head banging FUN music with a life changing message!!!  It's amazing how God has blessed the guys, they are getting better as they age (living for God has it's benefits :-D). Spread the Word...Godspeed
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Cool game a lot of fun helps pass the time.  Fun to shoot the animals.  Graphic are pretty good to.
0394818237|5.0|It is very informative with people doing different roles, meet my expectation when I roll out My community Theme in first quarter of 2014 for 5 years old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game. Careful! Your kids will want to play MINECRAFT for hours and hours! Great graphics, lots to do!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's a typically great John Grisham book, much better than The Litigators in my opinion. You always learn things from these legal fiction books that are so close to real. I'm sure if he ever wanted to return to being a lawyer, he would be fighting clients away he would be in such demand.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Elliot Cowan makes the best Darcy since Colin Firth.  I never thought I'd find another actor who could &#34;be&#34; Darcy.  The story is fun and witty with enough inside jokes for those who have seen every TV/movie adaption of the book.  Hugh Bonneville gives Mr. Bennet just the right amount of sardonic wit and Alex Kingston has just the right amount of irritation in the role of Mrs. Bennet.  This story will never replace the original, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  I am giving a copy to my daughter, who also loves P & P.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|After 6 years it's about time this album has made its way to the public! Love the songs and her voice.
B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|I was able to fully assemble my own system and power it up on the first try without one single issue. Lots of room for expansion. Just make sure you buy a slightly larger mid-tower such as a Corsair 650D if you are going to use liquid cooling, the heat sinks for the voltage regulators around the CPU are pretty tall and can cause interference problems with radiators.
B00ESF285S|5.0|Great story, great moral, awesome illustrations. This one we'll read a gazillion times without a doubt. Great, great, great, great.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Entertaining, interesting and inspiring!  I really enjoyed this book and it helped me understand the concepts behind creating your reality with our thoughts.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I bought this camera for use in my 4th grade classroom and it has been an excellent purchase! It's 100x better than an overhead projector. I can show manipulatives in full color, use workbooks to show pages on the screen, hold picture books under the camera for students to easily follow along, show examples of student writing on the spot for everyone to share and learn from...  I could go on and on and on. I highly recommend this for teachers. It is easy to use and shows a clear picture. I would definitely buy it again!
B000003CMB|5.0|It's the Allman Brothers, dude! How could it be anything less than awesome? The CD was new and arrived in perfect shape, just as advertised.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I have all the Cut the Rope games so I figured I might as well get this one too because I enjoyed the Cut the Rope games so much and this has been great! I have not had any issues or glitches at all  either.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids and I enjoy this game alike. The animals are adorable and fun to take care of. It's hard to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun.  Keeps me busy for hours.  The game can be frustrating  but when you win you sure feel good.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As always, a wonderful mix of historical facts with intertwined characters, following them through history that needs to be remembered, and the courageous acts that may need to be repeated.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I got this app for free ,with my Amazon coins. I totally recommend it !!!!!!! Total 5star game. Here's a tip save up for the Citroen survolt . ;)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm late reading this book, but had to do so before I would watch the movie. I was shocked, surprised, angry, scared & excited for Katie 's journey. I was angry with her past one minute, and happy how her future was taking place the next minute. This book hit all avenues of your feelings.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Most addicting app ever!  I have been using this app for some time now and I have actually created some of things that I have seen pinned.  I love it.  I could spend hours looking through all the different posts.  My family has also started saying &#34;did you find this on pinterest?&#34; when I create something fun or tastey.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. It's the same every time I pick up a Jack Reacher story. I'm<br /> working my way through all of them.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I'm sorry.  I guess I am truly an idiot.  Can't make this thing work.  Maybe my TV is too old?  Maybe this thing can't get a signal?  Me No LIkey this thing.  A total waste of my $$$.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Enjoying the game.  Like the simplicity. Begins easy enough, but gets progressively more difficult.  Will see if I continue to play.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a most interesting read as it is a TRUE story written by a REAL NEUROSURGEON.  My mother experienced this trip to heaven when I was just 7 years old and has told it all of my life and I have always believed in it and thought it true.  But for a Dr of Neurosurgery to have experienced it to such a degree and then to be able to write it all down makes it wonderful for all of the people who have experienced it and have told their story only to be put off by others.  I think it is GREAT and that more people should read it.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|Although this book is mostly about weight loss and has an 'umbrella' approach to most subjects, the most understated benefits are the sections where Tim Ferris talks about curing his medical conditions.<br /><br />As a person with several disc bulges, back pain and neck pain, I have to say if I had found his book earlier I would have saved thousands and thousands of dollars from going to see a chiro.<br /><br />I have personally had experience with \\"Active Release Technique\\" and was able to start weight training and running again over time, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. I cannot wait to try the rest of the recommended therapy solutions recommended by Tim as I am sick of inconsistent, non-authenticated reviews from the internet.<br /><br />Tim had severe sports injuries just like myself, because he has went to all the effort of finding the solution, now I don't have to spend truck loads of money on quacks and fakers.<br /><br />If only Tim could market this section of his books to people with back pain and chronic muscular/sport injuries I think we could all save heaps of money in the long run.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|They all can't end the way we dream they will.  It was good, but not great.  I look forward to the movies.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read everything King has written and this one one is great just like all the others. Once I started it I could not put it down. Keep on trucking Stephen. I look forward to your next one. I highly recommend.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is by far the best farm game that I have found. It has regular updates, which is great.  I also like the variety of plants and trees, as well as the many different spells that can be used. Very enjoyable game.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game very addicting!!!! A must have if you love puzzle games. And the graphics are very good keeps your attention.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really liked this book! It was very interesting,and I wish the movies would come out sooner! Great job on this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show! Bought this season because we were absolutely hooked and Netflix did not have at the time!
B00EEPFRGE|4.0|I liked REBORN but thought MURDER BY PRIDE was a weak uneven and badly mixed album. This is the real deal and they've never sounded better. Production is top shelf as well as the performance.<br /><br />The boys are back...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it is finally on Amazon..but its not updated the same as the app. from Google for android??<br />Still waiting for update so si can continue.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have just started playing this game Nd can't put it down. I love trying to figure out a strategy.
B00CATONCA|5.0|So addicted to this show! This package is fantastic! Cant wait for all of Season 4!  This is amazing and hope they do something else cool for the next one!
B00005JPSM|3.0|A nice romantic comedy a non maternal lady learning to love a child find love herself . Along the way she learnt to trust other people and let them into her life
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|To long time Korn fans, this album was a return to their innovative roots.  From the moment the drums, bass, and guitar start in &#34;Prey For Me&#34;, you know Korn is back again and just as good as ever. The dub-step experiment that was their last album, was something I stayed away from.  With Paradigm Shift, they use elements of all of their previous albums to make one rocking CD.  I noticed that several reviewers said how this CD is reminiscent of Issues, which I agree with.  It has a slight extra-terrestrial vibe mixed in with some of the songs that calls to mind &#34;falling away from me&#34; and &#34;make me bad&#34; (listen to Love & Meth and Paranoid and Aroused).  However, there are several new elements here that work very well.  A toned down dub-step (Korn-step, I've... dubbed it..) is still there but it works very well (listen to Spike in my Veins).  They even introduce an acoustic guitar (Lullaby for a Sadist) which I believe is the first time for that but I may be incorrect.  All in all, a great and refreshing CD for Korn fans that will make you want to dust off those old discs and have another listen.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|\\"Home For Christmas\\" is a beautiful, inspiring, emotional CD that I will play and enjoy throughout the year.  Susan Boyle has captured the holiday mood in her own unique way, and I love it.
B00BMKH5NW|2.0|Fangirl was really disappointing to me. After reading Eleanor & Park, one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read, I had high expectations.  I mean if an author can write a story that amazing, they should be able to follow it up with something that is at least pretty good. This book was just...it just wasn't as good as I had hoped. It was hard for me to read because it was so slow paced and nothing really happened for most of it. Cath didn't really change much or grow, she is basically the same person at the end as at the beginning (though she will kiss her boyfriend at the end so I guess she grew somewhat. That and the her story at the very very very end, just sneaking it in under the wire).<br /><br />One of my least favorite things about this book, though, was the fanfic and Simon Snow sections. I found them  really boring and skimmed them. Having an excerpt from the book or from Cath's fanfic after every chapter just took me out of the story. I kept trying to figure out why I was reading the passage I was and it never really seemed to fit. It didn't add to the story, it just took away from the story for me. By the end I wasn't even really skimming the passages, I was just skipping them since I disliked them so much. There were parts where she read long sections aloud and I skipped those pages all together. I just couldn't do it. I needed to so I could finish the book.<br /><br />Cath was also kind of annoying for me. I understand she has issues and she really probably needs some help dealing with her anxiety and such. Does she deal with all of this throughout the book? Not really. Yes she is forced to by her roommate to do some things, but she still has a lot of issues at the end of the book. Yes, her sister Wren has a stereotypical college life and her dad goes crazy so she has to deal with some new things, but by the end most things are back to the way they were before the beginning of the book. I really didn't like Wren, though she had issues as well. Sometimes Cath just seemed to whine about things and that got on my nerve. She hid herself away in her room writing her fanfic. The dad seemed like a caricature of someone with a mental illness (maybe it is just the way I read him).<br /><br />There were two characters I did like though, Reagan and Levi. I loved Levi. He was so happy and fun and I wish this would have been a book about him and Reagan instead of Cath. Or just him. I don't really care. I wish it would have been told from his super happy point of view. I probably would have enjoyed it more. I also liked Reagan as she was just so grumpy fun. I love the tough exterior on her. Story told from her point of view as well would have been good. I loved both of them and wish I would have been reading their story instead.<br /><br />Overall not a very good read. Very disappointing. And I felt like it just ended. I kept flipping back and forth on my ereader like wait am I missing some pages? Nope, that is the end. Now I am on the fence about reading the authors next book. I probably will just because Eleanor & Park was so amazing. Hopefully it will be better than this book.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]Sometimes Cath just seemed to whine about things and that got on my nerve.

B006XOBFB0|3.0|sound do not as original CD, play is very good. It seems made in China?? I wish sony make CD in Japan.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|You know, it's so awesome when you buy a new release from a band you're on the fence about, and the album blows your doors off.  This is what you'll get when you buy Reflektor.  \\"It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus)\\" is the new stadium anthem.  Can't wait to her this stuff live.  Just get it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|You should totally get this game if you love my little pony there are all sorts awesome thing to do and you could buy any of your favorite ponys and play with them to level them up and get more coins.
B00D02Z1EA|4.0|I really thought this would warrant 5 stars, but August Burns Red just didn't knock it out of the park like they did with Leveler.  I don't know what's missing, but there's something that just isn't there.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a really good album and really enjoyable, so maybe I just had too high of expectations after their last one.<br />The metal is unrelenting and full force.  Fans of the band won't be overly disappointed and fans of metal in general will find a lot to really enjoy here.
B006QPX7UI|4.0|My wife and I went to Gettysburg a couple of weeks ago and we loved it. The town and battlefield has a very special feeling. This movie also has that special feeling. The film follows the course of the battle while also weaving in personal relationships and powerful themes. The film is accompanied by a stirring soundtrack and all star performances from Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels, and Tom Berenger (to highlight a few). This rendition of Gettysburg can be a little long, but with the length you get a deep story and a good level of detail. I enjoy learning about the Civil war, and I am not a history buff. I enjoyed the way the movie detailed the battle and I didn't have a hard time following or enjoying the battle scenes. My favorite part of the film were the many speeches - from both sides. This movie has many touching moments. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in American history or the Civil war.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|This is one of the go-to movies for my kids. They love it. I bout the DVD, that lasted for about a month before the kids scratched it up. We then went bought the Amazon streaming version. Won't be going back to DVDs again.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Just awesome.  Very good. I play it everyday and never get tired of it. Definitely five stars.  I recommend highly
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book and want to read it over and over again in a continuous loop- like it's my new favorite song. I don't think I've ever had such a change in emotions over characters before. I loved them, hated them, felt sorry for them, I could never decide. They were continually changing and evolving.  Probably my favorite book this year.
081099741X|5.0|Everything about my favorite director and much more. I loved the different illustrations and the way the films are portrayed. + lovely insights and extra's
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Go to you tube and search samurai vs. Zombie defense 2 cheat and learn how to get all the revives you want so you will never die or spend a dime on this game. Enjoy great game play. I'm on level 206 currently.
1250038820|5.0|If it's even possible, the HONY book even touches more to the soul than Brandons blogupdates online. The descriptions are short, but straightforward and moving. Not your average bedside picturebook.
B00D2DI342|4.0|Another smashing cut by Daft Punk. This is sure to remain stuck in your head, and this record has three wonderful versions. The radio cut (Side B, Track 2) is the most well known, and contains the brevity required to keep this song fresh and catchy.<br /><br />The Daft Punk remix on the A side is quite long, and I dare say almost tedious and repetitive, but it is great if you need a nice long cut to listen to and enjoy. The first track on the B side, the original album edition, is a happy medium between the brief radio cut and the lengthy remix.<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this version of the single if you are a fan of the track. And, of course, Vinyl makes everything better.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it on most days,  some days multiple times,  with no problems at all. I like it very much.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter as a birthday present and she was so excited about it I decided to give it to her early. She absolutely loves it!  She is already needing more supplies to make the bracelets. I purchase from Amazon because the service is outstanding and the products to choose from are endless.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|It is a great movie.  Unfortunately the copy I received from Amazon which was a cheap copy because I cannot afford expensive copies, did not play.  I was never able to reach Amazon in any constructive way to be reinbursed or to be sent a good copy.  It seems that the cheaper copies are pirated and do not play on some or all DVD players, so Caveat Emptor.  Do not buy cheap movies from Amazon.<br /><br />amy adelson
B00G722T22|1.0|Holly CRAP, I hate Selena Gomez, Avril and third is Christina Perri. This singer have no idea or quality in what the produce.
B00EVW013E|3.0|The previews were quite sensational. But, guess what? Just like other previews, they were short lived. Typical adventure/drama and a little thrill. Wouldn't write home to mama about it. Too expensive too--Amazon should offer a 24hr rental. Now I have a video I'll most likely never repeat a viewing of in my library.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt includes this quote, usually attributed to Picasso, in The Goldfinch, perhaps as a way of acknowledging the plot, character and scene similarities to other great works of fiction.  As other reviewers have noted, the book includes elements of Great Expectations, Oliver Twist, and Harry Potter (mirror of erised, anyone?) .  I'm sure it nods to other great novels that I have never read, particularly Russian works.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a wonderful, engaging, plot-driven book.  Though it draws on the traditions of 19th century novels, it is very much a 21st Century work.  Each paragraph is beautifully worked; each word and name carefully chosen.  Moreover, the psychological elements of the characters appear particularly well researched:  Theo (like Van Gogh's brother? God? the Antipope?) and Pippa (nod to Great Expectations?) are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. This is a key part of who they are... \\"and the damage is part of the attraction.\\"<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!  I am already of jealous of all you readers out there who still have this delight in your future.
1476733953|5.0|I'm a long time SF fan. This is an excellent book. I started reading it last night and I can't put it down. It totally captures you from the first page.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Intriguing and delightful  Enjoyed it a great deal . Would recommend it to everyone who loves fantasy magic relationships with a bit of a disjointed tale.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Was on my doorstep literally the next day!!! Wrapped in plastic and everything - thank you so much! Great quality, as expected.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is my New obsession and escape. If you like period pieces, romance and war this may be up your alley as well. It's also fun to see the wardrobe and food!
B003B02OOG|5.0|If you're a Clanton afficionado, you'll enjoy these short stories.  Written in true Grisham style with a little humor and good development of characters.  Enjoy the short reads with a true look at living in the south.
B005DI994W|5.0|Great film, great copy and color....very well done. I have already watched it two times and have offered to share with friends.
B0034G4P26|5.0|Delightfully loony, Queen Victoria as a despicable villainess with an odd appetite, Charles Darwin as a mercenary out to win a science award by any means necessary, and a Pirate Captain who wants nothing more than to win Pirate of the Year for claiming the greatest bounty of booty imagined.  We soon learn that he and his cutthroat band of misfits are all masters of disguise and that \\"London (circa 1837) smells like grandma.\\"  I enjoyed their crazy misadventures immensely.  It's funny and fun with loads of sight gags and odd bits of humor.  How can you not love a parrot that's actually a dodo?  That, and ham night.<br /><br />What's the best part of being a pirate?  \\"The chance to catch exotic diseases.\\"
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, addictive! I have no complaints about the game. Everyone I know plays it and enjoys it also. A must have!
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|Downloaded game, but when I went to play it, it got to the point of asking me to pick a name, but would not take any suggestions. Kindle fire HDX
B00B52F278|5.0|Spartacus was one of the finest TV Series of all time. I don't buy DVDs as a rule, except when something like Spartacus comes along.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Acting needed help but effects were basically good.  I think everyone likes it because they expected it to suck.  Worth a watch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the g<br /><br />This is the GREATEST Book ever printed. I use it every day to guide my life. I can read the many translations from this work and see the difference. Very helpful in studying the Word of GOD.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|works as advertised but was kind of disappointed.  I was hoping that Google would come out with more features for this neat little device.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Great game just wish you could earn coins instead of just paying for them. Otherwise easy play instructions fun challenging levels good powerups.
B00FXRTWQ8|5.0|Great graphics, really good concept. Please continue to bring more to android like Harvest as soon as possible. Really cute story line and the rewards concept to build your tank and have a virtual fish tank and community.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|I liked it because it was really funny and had an excellent video quality.  I will watch it again and again!!!!
