B000059QYB|5.0|Most of us know Billy Idol from a few songs, most notably \\"Rebel Yell,\\" \\"Dancing With Myself,\\" \\"White Wedding,\\" \\"Eyes Without a Face,\\" and his remake of Tommy James and the Shondells' \\"Mony Mony\\". All of those hits are included, but so are less-popular but equally great songs such as the haunting \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" and the open-road scream of \\"Don't Need a Gun\\". The album, which is conveniently in chronological order, wisely does not venture too heavily into Idol's impressive but commercially-ignored album \\"Cyberpunk,\\" and it only includes one new song--a surprisingly good remake of Simple Minds' \\"(Don't You) Forget About Me\\" [useless fun fact: Billy Idol almost sang the original version back in 1985]--but the album is full of hits. That in itself is impressive since most greatest hits albums are nothing but a few stellar singles with some also-rans pasted on for effect, but it's doubly so in Idol's case since a lot of Idol's minor hits are just as good as his bigger ones. If you already own all of Idol's albums, you shouldn't waste your money on an album that only has one new song, but for those just getting into Idol, this is an excellent place to start.
B00005NB8K|5.0|I'll keep my review short and simple.  This is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies.  Val Kilmer should have won an Oscar for his performance, or at least received more praise.  Oliver Stone knows that his story isn't 100% true and he never claimed it to be.   This was his vision of The Doors, and with the help of Robbie Kreiger, Patricia Kennealy, Pamela Courson-Morrison's parents and John Densmore, he did an incredible job.  However, Meg Ryan wasn't all that.  She's a decent actress, but not worthy/cool enough to play Pamela Morrison.  When the movie came out, Meg talked about how over-rated she thinks The Doors(the band) are and that Jim Mrrison was just a drunk.  Well, Meg, why associate yourself with the movie then?  Anyway, the movie is an amazing experience.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|I think Rufus Wainwright is a type that kind of sounds like Bob Dylan.<BR>What I heard is that he is from Canada and he is a kind of folk rock singer.<BR>The 1st track is REALLY GOOD!<BR>But the song California is REALLY good!<BR>It talks about being in Califoria.<BR>Also Rebel Prince And The Consert Is a Really good track.
B000002IPZ|5.0|This is melodic thrash, complete with thick jams, cool lyrics, memorable tunes, without a single lame song.  The whole album is gold!! It rocks, yet it jams enough to be melodic.  The songs are awesome. There's even an awesome ballad called legacy.  Trust me, it's cool.  I'll always love this album.  Testament's first three albums were just building up to this masterpiece.  Funny though 'cuase right after this album in '92 the album The Ritual came out which was definately a fall from glory.  This was the band's pinnacle man.  This was it.  And 1990 was a heck of year for thrash.  Don't miss this album.  Trust me!  It's the best of it's genre.  You'll sit down and forget your listening to it it's that good, the music will just become a part of you...If that makes any sense! I really can't figure out what's with the people who gave this less than a 5 star review.  They're probably the same people that listen to new Metallica.  This album is better than anything metallica ever did including the old stuff.  You know why? Not because it's thrashier, but because it has more substance and lyrical quality.  It's just awesome.  Buy it!!
B00004XOWM|1.0|You know, all of these songs really are stupid. Like &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and &quot;Boiler&quot; obviously just put on this CD to attract attention to 50 f words and suicide. I mean really..its sad, because Limp Bizkit wasnt always this bad. Theyw ere never great, but this is the CD thats going to wreck their career. Sorry guys, you suck.
B00005UOXL|4.0|After your band dissolves, like Billy Idol's old band, Generation X did, you can do one of two things: 1) make a solo record that sets you up for a solo career; 2) make a solo record that goes nowhere. Idol managed to make it into the former category, although just barely (MTV helped him out a lot). That said, this is a strong debut for an artist just starting out on a career. It includes &quot;Dancing With Myself&quot; and &quot;White Wedding&quot;--two of his biggest hits, but the rest of the album holds its own. And already Idol was willing to take some chances: a church organ-esque intro to &quot;Nobody's Business,&quot; the bouncey, jungley vibe of &quot;Love Calling,&quot; the horrible picture of him on the back cover. This re-release of the original album does not include any nifty bonus songs that have become a staple of re-releases; however, the album liner notes now include the Billboard chart positions of his songs for those that are into that type stuff. Idol became a huge star with his subsequent album, but if you want to hear him at one of his best moments--when he's trying to prove his chops--this is the album to pick up.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|Lets be honest. We probaly though this was going to be the best wrestlemania ever right? All the time weve been waiting for the day to come, all the hype been going on, about 5 hours long wasted. Most of the matches were bad and they just messed it all up. Do they take us for fools? It seems that way.<br />Here is some information on the matches:<br />1. John Cena VS Big Show: Match was never really gonna be that good as i knew especially with Big Show fighting a much smaller wrestler. It was a bit slow but at least the right man (Cena) won.   Rating: 4/10<br />2. Raw Tag Team Title Fatal Four Way: Match was ok though i dont think it should have been fatal four way. The Dudleys didnt really do much La Resistance was a bit bad and Garrison and Cade were too but Booker T and Van Dam did ok.       Rating: 4.5/10<br />3.Christian vs Y2J: Match was actually alright. It was a bit short but it turned out to be one of the best matches of the night. Also the ending was good at the end where Trish Stratus showed up.       Rating: 6.5/10<br />4. Evolution vs Rock and Sock Connection: Match was ok at times. Rock was good and Flair was funny at times. Foley was a bit of a dissapointment but since hes been out for 4 years, you cant really take it out on him. Batista could have done better. Orton and Foley fighting however was the best part.      Rating: 5.5/10<br />5. Playboy Evening Gown Match: Big mistake to have this match at Wrestlemania. I can see why they would have it but then most of the fans werent intrested. The crowd seemed pretty dead the whole match.      Rating: 2/10<br />6. Cruiserweight Title match: match was a little dissapointing and i wasnt intrested much in this match at all. However there was some good parts so it wasnt completely unwatchable.        Rating: 5/10<br />7. Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg: What a dissapointment. After all the time waiting for them to fight in the ring, all the tension that has been building up and it turns out like this! Whats worse isthat both wrestlers have the potential to put on a good match and they hardly do anything! And the crowd showed their hatred and quite frankly you cant blame them! Absoutely terrible match!        Rating: 2/10<br />8. Smackdown Tag Team Fatal Four Match: Bad Match. Should never have taken place. However some teams were good some were bad though it wasnt really anything to enjoy about Rating: 4/10<br />9. Molly vs Victoria Hair match: Nothing good about this match. Boring and bad at least they kept it short. Only good thing about it was Molly getting her head shaved at the end which was the highlight of the match.  Rating: 1.5/10<br />10. Kurt Angle vs Eddie Guerrero: Good match. Both contenders put on a good show. Eddie and Angle are 2 of the best wrestlers in WWE and it was a good choice to have these 2 slugging it out in the ring. Though it was a bit short, it turned out to be one of the best matches and id like to see them fight again if possible.  Rating: 7/10<br />11. Undertaker vs Kane: Big dissapointment for Undertakers deadman gimmick. He looked so bad it was embarrasing to have him back. He looked terrible. The match was bad as well proving that Taker is past it.   Rating: 3/10<br />12. Triple Threat Match: Match of the night. All wrestlers put on a good show and the fans enjoyed it. This is one of the best matches to have taken at an event this year in WWE and it was very watchable. Also Benoit winning the title was a good choice since its about time he good a decent title.             Rating: 8/10<br />Overall wrestlemania 20 was dissapointing. Too many matches took place. some were bad some were good. However Vince should have known better.
B000099T3P|5.0|The best horror movie I have ever seen. If you like action there is plenty of it. Critter is horror but it also has some fun parts in it. Like when crit says they have weapons.  The other says so what the wife blast him to bits with her rifle. The other Krite says the f word and rolls away.  Don Opper is wonderfull as Charley.  Bradly brown is adorable as a little boy. The funnet horror movie since Gremlins. If you like this there other three. Note 3 and 4 are not as good as 1 and 2.  Only 2 people get killed during all of three.  <br />If you want to she lots of gore you second one you want. Critters was and alway will be best exitent horror series ever written. There should not of stop making them.   If you are really sensitive you should not watch these film.  There was this one guy who review Critters 4. There was one guy that saw Critters 4 that cried for 3 hours after he finished watching them.<br />The krites are evil like the gremlins  but not a smart  they do some dumb things. Eatting and drink inatimate objects one thing that is done in Critters 1  2 and 3.  A good series funny and hillarious.  I recetly  purchsed these 4 in DVD format.
B000003C4K|5.0|This is the best thrash album ever made.  Listen to Paul Baloff's awesome screaming voice!  The guitars shred and contain thick jams like you've never heard before.  This is coolness the way you've always dreamed about!!  Awesome lyrics; not too deep, not too shallow, mildly satanic, funny (as in Deliver Us TO Evil), and cool.  Paul really only gave us one studio album.  But man did he deliver.  <BR>You'll love this album.  It's a timeless thrash classic that broke all the expectations of thrash.  I mean when this album was released thrash was just getting started.  True, Slayer was around, but the musicianship in slayer's old recordings don't even come close to this!!<BR>If you buy this album, you won't be disapointed....If you are, your a tard!!
B000002BBY|5.0|Back in 1995 this album was a world-wide smash, and for good reason: the songs are brilliant. Oasis' previous album, \\"Definitely Maybe,\\" had been cited as too derivative, but with this album Oasis very clearly came into their own. It includes the singles \\"Wonderwall,\\" (possibly the best Britpop song of all time), \\"Roll With It\\" (famous for losing to Blur in the Battle of the Bands), \\"Don't Look Back in Anger,\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova (which I am not a big fan of, but it serves well as an album closer). The album tracks are equally impressive: \\"She's Electric\\" is fun, \\"Some Might Say\\" is catchy, \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is poignant, and \\"Hello\\" is a good opening track. Oasis' subsequent albums have been wildly inconsistent, so if you're just a casual fan, this is probably the album you want. But unlike most other albums that are built around one or two great singles, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory\\" holds up as a sonic masterpiece.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Sure the humans make peace with the machines, but there is still a Matrix, there's still a Zion, there is still a machine city, and their are still endless fields of human slaves, and the whole world is still covered by black clouds. There is a new Matrix online video game where thousands of online gamers will interact to shape the new world, But I would rather have a movie that gives an ending, or at least another movie that begain to shape a new world before this new online game, then it wouldn't have to start from complete kayoss.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's album Hybrid Theory is AMAZING.They have a great singer(Chester Bennington)who can not only sing but scream as well, an amazing rapper(Mike Kenji Shinoda)who truly knows how to rhyme(and unlike other rapppers, he can also sing quite well!),a guitarist(Brad Delson) who sends waves through you,a drummer(Rob Bourdon)who is excellent and never misses a beat, and a DJ(Mr. Hahn)who knows how to work those tables.What shows their greatness other than having great talent?Their album beat EVERYBODY.And without their bass player.Oh yeah. And now that they have him back(Pheonix) they sound better than ever.Their lyrics truly connect with the lives of their fans.I know that for a fact. They keep us teenages from going to the mental hospital. They stop many from ending their life. They inspire many to become as great as them, to keep going. LINKIN PARK is truly amazing.And for those reviewers who don't think that( such as AFI K. JAMES)take a look again.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This album rocks!!! It completely shreds!!!  The jams on this album are thick and raw. The singing quality is fast and cool.  The only thing this album lacks is better lyrics.  This album really gives Bonded By Blood, by Exodus, a run for it's money in the category of best hardcore 80's thrash album.  Musically I think this one's better....But in lyrics and singing, Bonded wins.  <BR>Listen to the guitar work by Andreas Kisser on this album, I've never heard anything like it.  I mean, I've heard stuff LIKE it, but nowhere near the same. Imagine a combination of Master of puppets style fast thrash, with the dark power of Slayer, and the simple, quality riffing of Sodom all rolled into one.  This album is a GOD@#$% CLASSIC!!! It Rules!!!
B000002AS3|3.0|When this album came out in Britain in '94, it was a sensation, becoming one of the most successful debut albums of all time. America never quite followed suit, preferring to wait for Oasis' second album. So for those of you who are thinking of buying this album because you bought &quot;(What's the Story) Morning Glory&quot; and loved it, I'm here to tell you that the two albums are almost nothing alike. On &quot;Definitey Maybe&quot; Oasis have enjoyable songs, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from the fact that A) the riffs are stolen (like the hijacked T. Rex riff on &quot;Cigarettes and Alcohol&quot;); B) the songs are silly (&quot;Married With Children&quot;); C) the titles are somewhat unusual (&quot;Shakermaker,&quot; &quot;Digsy's Diner&quot;). The songwriting is also not nearly as refined; this is Noel Gallagher's &quot;genius in training&quot; album. &quot;Supersonic&quot; is the best song on the album, and it's a personal favorite of mine, but even that song is pretty weak compared to what he'd come up with later. So, if you're looking for any Oasis album to buy, go for &quot;(What's the Story) Morning Glory&quot;. But if you're going through and buying all of Oasis' albums, this is a decent way to start.
006016848X|4.0|I have to admit that after hearing so much about this book for so many years, I had rather high expectations when I started reading it. While I would not say that I was completely blown away, it turned out to be a very worthwhile read.<br />The main objective of the book is to help men and women communicate better in relationships. The book is built on the premise that women and men speak in essence \\"different languages.\\" While the Mars/Venus metaphor gets redundant rather quickly, the message it conveys is valid and thought-provoking. Men and women do tend to express themselves differently, which often causes breakdowns in communication between them. This book teaches us to be more sensitive to these differences, understand each other better, and be able to express our needs in a manner that the other person can understand. Above all, the book teaches us to respect each other, really listen to the other person, and be a better partner to them. In addition to raising our awareness about the different styles of communication, the book also gives many practical solutions to common problems, down to the exact words that one should say to achieve the desired result. While this may seem simplistic, it gives very useful illustration of these principles in action. <br />I do have some reservations about the book. First, the author takes a very stereotypical approach to both genders and their relationship. For example, most women in his examples are meek housewives who wait for their tired husbands to come home from work at the end of the day, and whose greatest joy in life is going shopping with their husband's money. While sometimes generalization may be necessary to make a point, such an old-fashioned idea of marriage made it difficult to apply the learnings wholeheartedly to my own situation. The second problem is that the major learning takes place in the first four chapters; the rest seem redundant and contain more filler material, reinforcing the points made in earlier chapters. Such repetition may be helpful to drive the points home, but it also makes for less-than-inspiring reading. <br />Despite some of the problems with the book, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. It contains a lot of very insightful information that can help anyone make immediate and lasting positive changes in their relationship with the opposite sex. The book is all the more valuable if both people in a couple read this book in order to gain a better understanding of each other and build a stronger foundation for their relationship together.
B0000024W3|5.0|Anyone who doesn't get the brilliance of this album has no connection with true poetic soul.  The man remains a prophet.  I would put Dylan above all authors of the Bible.  Listen to the music, the words; cannot you realize its transcendent opulence? Compare this album, SELF PORTRAIT, to ANY ALBUM RELEASED in the last twenty years...can you honestly say there is better songwriting, loose-in-the-backyard production, sounding like Dylan and the band members are playing you a barbecue show just as a favor for you, and you thereby receiving Sacrament---can this honestly be equaled by product by any other so-called artist, band?  He is above music, he meets the poets and straddles the line of literature for the man and woman who can remember a soul.  Miss this album at your peril, and be relegated to the soulless chasm of Dave Matthews and Britney Spears.  With Love, Jimmy Diamonds
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Richard Curtis, the writer and director of Love actually, also wrote Four weddings and a funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's diary, so it should come as no surprise that this is a feel good movie from start to end.<br />The particular difference between Love actually and those other movies is the fact that instead of following one story, we meet more than 10 individual stories that sometimes cross each other. All of them are love stories, all different and all particular to each character's life, but in the end, they all spin around love.<br />There's Hugh Grant in one of the years most inspired castings, as the new Prime Minister, who falls in love at first sight with one of his assistants (Martine McCutcheon). There's Colin Firth as a man who finds love after he finds he's wife cheating on him. There's Liam Neeson as the widowed step-father of a young boy suffering from unrequited love. There's Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman as a married couple going through the motions. There's Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as a couple who meet in one of the weirdest ways ever (and I do mean EVER). There's Andrew Lincoln and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Keira Knightley as a couple of newlyweds and their best friend. There's Kris Marshall as one of the biggest losers in the love department who figures he needs to go to America to use his british accent as a hook to get girls. There's Bill Nighy as an over-the-hill rock star who manages to get himself one last Christmas hit (and, quite probably, the funniest character in the whole movie). There's Laura Linney as a lonely american woman who's been forever in love with a co-worker. And finally, there's a whole bunch of cameos that I won't spoil for you.<br />Love actually is truly one of those movies from which you come out in love with love. It's fresh, it's funny, it's romantic, it's sad, it's all of those things that love is to all of us.<br />It does have a few minor problems, particularly with some of the pacing. Too many story lines will do that. Also, there are times when you wish a little more time be devoted to some of the stories instead of others. Some are too short for the viewer to have time to connect with the characters.<br />Despite this little misgivings, Love actually is a warm, funny film and a great date movie that you should share with a loved one, not only during the Christmas holidays, but throughout all the year.lines will do that.

B000003JAY|3.0|Billy Idol songs don't really need to be remixed, so I wasn't expecting too much from this album. However, it turned out to be surprisingly good. &quot;Catch My Fall&quot; is easily the best of the bunch--the song gets a complete overhaul and ends up turning out better than the original. The subtle changes in &quot;Hot in the City&quot; also help make the song a bit cooler than it already was. There are some flaws: &quot;White Wedding Part II&quot; is a boring, mostly wordless addition to &quot;White Wedding Part I&quot; (which is the one you know); &quot;Dancing With Myself&quot; doesn't seem to get remixed at all; there are only eight songs on the album. Additionally, the album sleeve is absolutely pathetic: it's simply a list of all the songs on the album. This is definitely not the album to start an Idol phase off on, but if you already like Idol's music, this a sufficiently entertaining way to hear some of his old songs in a new light.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great cast, great writing, a very interesting setting, and mysteries to uncover later on, but Fox didn't keep it around.  Damn them.<br />There's so little of interest on TV for me, that when the best of the shows doesn't make it, it makes one lose interest in the media itself.
0060090383|5.0|This was the first book I read by Marian Keyes, and I found it so enjoyable that I went out and bought several others of hers. You don't need to have read the first couple of books in the series to be up to speed about the characters in this one. Somehow Keyes has been able to write about ending up in detox and the course of the serious things Rachel goes through with a very funny edge, while still keeping it very believable (she went through it herself - more power to her - which I'm sure enabled her to describe situations so realistically).  Entirely readable; would be a great airplane or vacation book.
0375704027|5.0|This is the first book by Haruki Murakami I've read, and on the strength of this, I would certainly attempt his other novels. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is a quick read, drawing the reader in closer and deeper as the characters, their lives, and their deaths intertwine.<br />Having just finished the book, I'm at a bit of a loss for what to say about it. It is about love, death, youth, friendship, and ultimately, how fragile and delicate humans are, and how much we seek protection from this fragility in the arms of others or in our own private prisons. Toru Watanabe, the protagonist, locks himself in a prison of solitude, which he eventually escapes, with difficulty, only through the death of a close friend/lover and the realization that he is basically alone in the world. This realization forces him to come to terms with his feelings for a woman who challenges his cold side while simultaneously acknowledging his softer side via her own need for companionship, understanding, and love.<br />There are many deaths in this book, although they take place somewhat at the outskirts of the other action. The deaths act as catalysts for characters to learn, grow, change, or in some cases, retreat, wither, and become isolated. It is this constant interplay between retreat and advancement, withering and growth, isolation and togetherness, which seems to be a theme of this novel, and a central struggle each and every one of its characters must face. In that respect, Murakami has hit on a central struggle for all humans: intimacy vs. independence.<br />It's Murakami's amazingly poetic writing, his evocative, sensual observations, and the way he renders characters so complex with the simplest of language and details that makes this novel so memorable. Another reviewer compared it to Milan Kundera's &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; and while the content and themes are somewhat different, perhaps the lesson is that the elusive &quot;comfort zone,&quot; finding it and staying in it, is a major concern of and struggle for most people. There is always something ready to knock us off or out of that balance.<br />The ending of this novel doesn't suggest that Watanabe has found that balance or lost it. It really says nothing about how Watanabe resolves the current dynamics in his life. And perhaps that &quot;non-ending&quot; is just another reflection of the &quot;unbearable lightness of being,&quot; the strange place which we seem to inhabit only at times, when our expectations, needs, and actions all seem to magically work together at once. The normal state of affairs is that these things conspire to unbalance us, especially when we bring other people into the equation. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; expresses, in beautiful language, how the balance between people is so delicate, and how it sometimes takes a major catalyst, like death or loss, to jolt us into understanding our inter-connectedness.aying in it, is a major concern of and struggle for most people.

B00006LLNU|3.0|There are so many things potentially wrong with this album that it should just fall apart. For starters, the title of the album makes it hard to ask for in stores. Plus none of the songs have titles. And they're seven minutes long. And they're mostly word-less (and the parts that do have vocals are done in Icelandic). But somehow it still works. The album has a gentle, easy feel to it, and the songs really work together to create a bigger whole; in other words, each track stands on its own and yet still helps make the album greater than the sum of its parts. The best song on the album is the first track, made all the better by an award-winning video featuring children playing in gas masks. But be warned: this album is definitely not for everybody. All the songs are the slow, relaxing kind. It's nice to study or sleep to, but you cannot blare this on your stereo while you're driving. In fact, Enya might even accuse this album of being too &quot;easy listening&quot;. But if you've got a few extra dollars to spare, and you want something different, this is a good album to try out.
B00005Q4ED|2.0|Don't bother unless you can't find the version with Timothy Dalton.  I watched that version first.  Then this one.  This one was so poorly done in comparison that I got up and mopped the kitchen floor while it played and fast forwarded through the non-talking scenes.  While the acting was good enough, the script leaves too much unsaid.  It is difficult to see why the two main characters would bother falling in love with each other.  The plot just wasn't developed enough to warrant it.  So many key parts of the story are missing.  I highly recommend the version with Timothy Dalton and Zetah Clarke instead
B00006BTCA|5.0|I have no idea what the words mean on this album, but I could really care less.  Serge Gainsbourg is genius and I don't speak a word of French.  The key here is this album will rip you ass off with rock and roll.  The only thing I like better than this album is hot fudge sundae with banana!
B0000019PA|5.0|I first heard this 1998 album some time during 2002.  As a bit of a music connoisseur, I am shocked I wasn't exposed to such a masterpiece earlier.  On my first listen, the lo-fi production and stripped down sound were immediately intriguing.  I enjoyed the strange instrumentation mixed with the sometimes Celtic-sounding drones and catchy, simple, yet eerie melodies.  Also immediately engrossing was Jeff Mangum's almost uncomfortably revealing, honest voice.  By the title track, I realized this album was going to transcend any level of greatness I could have even hoped for.  I think I uttered to myself in shock, &quot;This is my new favorite band.&quot;  Something magical was happening, and it was almost scary.  I know this may sound a bit over-the-top, but the only reason I'm compelled to write this review is that I'm dead serious.  I've had the album two years now, and it still grips me more than any other album.  I don't foresee it ever becoming one that just sits on the shelf.<br />While Neutral Milk does have some similarities to The Decemberists (vocal style, instrumentation, heady lyrics), there is an intense urgency on Aeroplane that sets it apart.  FAR apart from them or really anything else I've ever heard.  Much of this has to do with the fact that Mangum is a little off his rocker.  Many of his songs deal directly with an obsession he has with Anne Frank and the Frank family in general.  (Yes, THAT Anne Frank.)  And though it's hard to believe possible, the strangeness of that fact becomes easy to set aside as you are drawn into the intensely gripping emotions he conveys throughout the record.  Not everyone will &quot;get&quot; this album, but if you do, it will stir up emotions you didn't know existed...emotions so intense they are, at the very least, unsettling, and can quite easily be frightening.  This album will haunt you.  It is impossible for me to recommend it as highly as it deserves to be recommended.
B00005Y7LD|4.0|Billy Idol is one of those artists who have the unfortunate tendency of releasing wildly successful singles that do not truly represent the album from which they came. In this case the single is &quot;Cradle of Love&quot;. &quot;Cradle&quot; is a great song, and it's easily one of his biggest songs (cool video too), but the album has a more mature, introspective feel to it that &quot;Cradle&quot; (and to a lesser extent, &quot;LA Woman&quot;) ultimately betrays. This is Idol's attempt to evolve as an artist, as evidenced on quasi-confessionals like &quot;Prodigal Blues&quot; or tragic love-gone-wrong songs like &quot;Endless Sleep&quot;; however, he does not abandon his trademark rebel yell on tracks like the rocking &quot;Love Unchained&quot;. By trying to advance as an artist while keeping elements of what made him famous intact, Idol created an album that hinted at potential future greatness. It unfortunately was not to be, but for simply being an &quot;almost great&quot; album, &quot;Charmed Life&quot; is pretty solid.
B000002MUW|5.0|I got Erotica and I loved it. Then I got Bedtime Stories and I absolutely loved it! It's a great album from start to finish. Most of the tracks sound like they could have been on any R&amp;B station at that time, &quot;back in the day&quot;, which is a side of Madonna I had never heard. I knew she had done pop, rock, techno, house, jazz, and some country but not R&amp;B. And she's good at it. I purchased this album when I found out that most of it was produced by Soul II Soul collaborator Nellee Hooper, who at the time seemed to have the Midas touch when it came to music, so I KNEW that this album was gonna rock! My favorite tracks are &quot;Survival&quot;, &quot;Inside Of Me&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;, &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me&quot;, and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, which in retrospect was a precursor to the late-90s/turn-of-the-century style switch to electronica music in Madge's career, which is fine with me. I luv u, Madonna!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|The music speaks for itself at [...] <br />Listen to all the album and see why it went to number 1 in the UK and France and the top 5 in another 10 countries and why dates in Europe/Scandinavia, Australiasia and Japan have been sold out. A few lucky US cities get a chance to hear them in April before its back to headlining summer festivals across Europe.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Dylan's first three albums: Bob Dylan, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, and The Times They Are A-Changin' immediately established him as a songwriter of great distinction. If you like Bob Dylan these three albums are a must for your collection.<br />May I also recommend a book that is available on this web site: \\"The Bob Dylan Albums\\" by Anthony Varesi. The book by Varesi is a fair and honest review of the albums by Dylan.
B000006045|5.0|Probably the best band under the trip-hop genre, Massive Attack outdo themselves with this terrific and hypnotic album. Certainly one of the best records of the late nineties and much likely the best trip-hop release ever, &quot;Mezzanine&quot; is an excellent dark album, truly captivating an intriguing end-of-the-milennium atmosphere. <br />Massive Attacks`s third effort is more rock-oriented than their previous ones, relying on the strenght of guitars. Still, the electronic elements play a big role as well, as the band again uses a lot of loops and samples to create and absorbing and at times claustrophobic mood. Each song is a complex and addictive moment and none of them lack distinction. This is a strong and compelling record without any filler. The opener &quot;Angel&quot;, sung by frequent collaborator Horace Andy, starts in a smooth and subtle note to end with an amazing guitar explosion that makes for a perfect beginning to the album. Other highlights (even if it`s difficult to choose highlights here) include the gorgeous first single &quot;Teardrop&quot;, the spooky and unsettling &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot;, the superbly dark and nightmarish &quot;Man Next Door&quot; or the unusual and haunting &quot;Group Four&quot;. <br />&quot;Mezzanine&quot; is by far Massive Attack`s best release, a multilayered and diverse record which carries an hypnotic nocturnal feel, presenting songs full of tension, mysteries and countless details. This album offers something new and unique with each listen, becoming vicious and a true must-own. It also has something for everyone, as it is difficult not to like at least one or two songs here (I think they`re all great, even the instrumental &quot;Exchange&quot;).  <br />One of the best records of the last decade.
B000002UB6|4.0|This album is a good addition to Let it be...Naked which should be bought first to hear the beatles original versions of the songs as they were meant to be heard with as paul qoutes the &quot;back to basics&quot; concept with just a band recording songs live, without over-dubs. On Let it be, with the exception of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, which I think drowns out Paul's voice and piano with the orchestra, Phil Spector's re-mixed versions are good, to give the songs a different sound. As for songs like, &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;, and &quot;For you Blue&quot;, give you the studio chatter before and after the songs, and are more like movie mixes from the movie &quot;Let it be&quot;, rather than the actual finished songs like on Let it be...Naked. Also, the songs &quot;Dig it&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; are nice little jams, to give you more of an insight to the beatles recording sessions during the production of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, rather than as actual songs. All in all, I strongly urge people to buy &quot;Naked&quot; first, then &quot;Let It Be&quot;, to add a different look to the great songs of &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot;.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Michael Buble has won me over with his charm. Charm. It's a word that resonates class and bearing. He's charming and on this dvd we're treated to his exquisite musical journey. From the opening moments you are treated to a private look at the man with the velvet voice. To audiences large and small, he sings with such passion and grace you feel his voice gracing your ears. His is the lovliest of sounds. When he invites the massive audience at one of his shows to sing the chorus of the classic Beegees song, How can you mend a broken heart, you can see the joy in his eyes knowing he is connecting with each and every one of them. And his connection to every audience is remarkable. There is love in the air and you feel it. That kind of magical energy that only the greatest entertainers possess is part of the Buble Gift.<BR>Charming....................

B000000WA2|3.0|A solid and appealing piece of britpop, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is not Blur`s best album to date, yet it offers a compelling set of worthwile pop songs. As usual, this release presents catchy and effective tunes with ironic, clever and witty lyrics, alongside Damon Albarn`s peculiar and addictive voice. There are a couple of memorable hits to find here, like the overplayed &quot;Country House&quot;, the dead-on &quot;Stereotypes&quot;, the smart &quot;Charmless Man&quot; or the gorgeous &quot;The Universal&quot;, certainly one of Blur`s best songs ever. An interesting meld of alternative and mainstream sounds, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is a notable effort that deserves some attention, even if some of its moments are a tad too dated already. Overall, this is a strong and convincing record that brings the mid-nineties to mind.<br />An enjoyable effort.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Its strange.  I ordered this CD becuz I already heard it and thought that it was a great compilation of EJ's work.  Upon recieving said item I was confused and more than a little disturbed seeing that &quot;Blessed&quot; is not included on the CD even though it is clearly listed and I've heard it on this compilation before.<br />Very strange...was it pulled from the disc for some reason?  I don't know.  But that is one of the songs that I was ordering for and now I haven't got it.  That just 'aint cool.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The first sci-fi trilogy for teenagers who have a bloated case of attention deficit disorder comes to a close, not without a bang, but a whimper. Basically, any fan who sees Matrix Revolutions will probablly come out of this wondering why he or she cared about any of this mind spam in the first place.<br />     The war between man and machines takes ahead as the Sentinels breach the loading dock to the human city. Neo is stuck between the matrix and the real world. Agent Smith has taken over the matrix by transforming and absorbing everything in his path (even The Oracale can't stop him). Its up to Neo, Trinity, and Morepheus to save the planet from total ruin.<br />     &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot;, like its predesessors, rips off other films. This time out Aliens, Robocop 2, Thelma &amp; Lousie (the sunrise scene reminded of the end of this film. I laughed so hard when this scene showed up I got a few intense stares from some Matrix fans, a.k.a. losers) and Saving Private Ryan. A waste.

B000002C1V|1.0|You better Run Like Hell from this album because its the worst thing ever produced on tape besides Metallica's St Anger. I can't believe the record company allowed this piece of crap to come out. The songs lack melody and the music is a great way to cure insomnia.<br />To the people who gave this album two stars or more (esp. the four and five star ones), whats wrong with you? You guys are Pink Floyd Sheep. I can't believe you don't know what is terrible music... you guys are no better than a Staind fan!
6300184064|5.0|Some of the most imaginative, beautiful, elements I've ever seen in a film. And the music is wonderfully manipulative and varied. You feel that you're watching several genres at once: a detective story, a war movie, a romance, and a Britcom. It is really a simple story about one man's search for meaning and humanity in a gray world filled with pain and alienation.<br />The subject-matter, probably absurd at the time the film was made, is looking all too familiar these days. Although the fantastical society we find ourselves in seems to be free, it clearly is not.  Rather, we find a paranoic extreme that hauls innocent people in for torture and interrogation simply because they are considered 'subversives' by the powers that be (that is, the Ministry of Information).  I certainly hope this is not a prophecy about to come true!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I give it 5 stars mainly because I can't stop playing Achilles Last Stand and Kashmir. Those two are absolutely thunderous and they didn't screw them up with a bunch long-winded changes. Just give it to me straight. I played the hell out of Achilles Last Stand when Presence came out in the mid 70's too. Underrated song that luckily this DVD set captured quite well. John Paul Jones plays the most incredible bass and finger plucking to accent Plant's voice at just the right time in this song. And Bonham's drums are sheer power. You can walk out of the room without watching anything and feel those bombastic drums. No other band is so driven by THE DRUMS.  Sorry, Neil Peart. You may get the finesse crown but Bonham is the undisputed King of Power.  <br />Other highlights (I haven't watched all the stuff yet) is The Ocean from the Madison Square Garden footage. Those pants of Jimmy's are great. Antics remind me of a combo of Eddie Van Halen meets Ronnie James Dio (Rainbow Rising).<br />The set from Earl's Court is first rate. Excellent sound. <br />The only thing missing is Ramble On....<br />You look back at the older black and white footage and it might be a little rough on the edges but what you are witnessing is the real birth of HARD ROCK. It brings a tear to your eyes seeing the reaction from those young fans. They and Led Zep wrote the book forever baby....
B0001IN07Q|2.0|I was all excited when I saw this CD/DVD become available.  I love Michael's versions of &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;The Summer Wind&quot;, &quot;How Do You Mend A Broken Heart&quot;, and &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot;.  Although let's all please be honest: MB is a total Sinatra-Wanna-Be. His phrasing, style, and intonation is a consistant, 100% dead-on replication of Frank S.  Nevertheless, I do like his sound, and the musical production/engineering on his recordings is terrific.<br />Now for this combo.  The DVD is simply awful.  The editing is so frantically MTV-style, I swear there is not one shot of Michael singing that is longer than ten seconds.  Interspersed with this so-called &quot;concert&quot; (hardly), are shots of Michael riding in the back of a limo, babbling and letching over girls walking down the street.  Nice.  Who dreamed this wretched concept up, anyway?<br />The CD itself is OK, but there are only eight songs on it, most of which you can find on his other disc.<br />Excuse me, I have to run out and buy a Harry Connick Jr. recording to calm my nerves.
B00005MNP7|5.0|This is quite possibly my favorite Blondie album of all time.  The styles are varied but tie in together, and the vocals, instruments, and composition of each and every song is terrific.  <br />In addition to the original amazing album, the CD also comes with four bonus tracks, which alone are worth the cost of the album.  Blondie's covers of Ring of Fire and Seven Rooms of Gloom are fantastic, as are their live versions of Die Young Stay Pretty and Heroes.<br />Though the varied styles may seem intimidating at first, listen to the entire album.  You will be amazed at the beautiful EVERYTHING on Eat to the Beat.
0375413405|5.0|Rarely are we able to say with certainty that a book is at the top of its subject in regard and quality. This book, `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle, and Simone Beck is certainly in that most unique position among cookbooks written in English and published in the United States.<br />With Julia Child's celebrity arising from her long series of TV cooking shows on PBS, it may be easy to forget how Ms. Child rose to a position with the authority that gave her the cachet to do these shows in the first place. This book is the foundation of that cachet and the basis of Ms. Child's influence with an entire generation of amateur and professional chefs.<br />It may also be easy to forget that this book has three authors and not just one. The three began as instructors in a school of French cooking, `Les Ecole des Trois Gourmandes' operating in Paris in the 1950's. And, it was from their experience with this school that led them to write this book. To be fair, Julia Child originated a majority of the culinary content and contributed almost all of the grunt work with her editors and publisher to get the book published.<br />The influence of this book cannot be underestimated. It has been written that the style of recipe writing even influenced James Beard, the leading American culinary authority at the time, to change his style of writing in a major cookbook on which he was working when `...French Cooking' was published. Many major American celebrity experts in culinary matters have cited Child and this book as a major influence. Not the least of these is Martha Stewart and Ina Garten. It is interesting that these first to come to mind are not professional chefs, but caterers and teachers of the household cook. Child was not necessarily teaching `haute cuisine', she was teaching what has been named `la cuisine Bourgeoise' or the cooking of the housewife and, to some extent, the cooking of the bistro and brasserie, not the one or two or three star restaurant.<br />The table of contents follows a very familiar and very comfortable outline, with major chapters covering Soups, Sauces, Eggs, Entrees and Luncheon Dishes, Fish, Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Cold Buffet, and Deserts and Cakes. The table of contents does not itemize every recipe, but it does break topics down so that one can come very close to a type of preparation you wish from the table of contents. One of the very attractive schemas used to organize recipes in this book is to take a general topic such as Roast Chicken and give not one, but many different variations on this basic method. Under Roast Chicken, for example, you see Spit-roasted Chicken, Roast Chicken Basted with Cream, Roast Chicken Steeped with Port Wine, Roast Squab Chickens with Chicken Liver Canapes, Casserole-roasted Chicken with Tarragon and Casserole-roasted Chicken with Bacon. Thus, the book is not only a tutorial of techniques, it is also a work of taxonomy, giving one a picture of the whole range of variations possible to a basic technique.<br />The book goes far beyond being a simple collection of recipes in many other ways without straying from the culinary material. Unlike books combining regional recipes with anecdotal memoirs, this book is all business. Heading the recipes is a wealth of general knowledge on cooking variables such as weights versus cooking time and conditions. Headnotes also include general techniques on, for example, how to truss a chicken (with drawings) and many deep observations on professional technique. The notes on roasting chicken instructing one to attend to all the senses in watching and listening to the cooking meat in order to obtain the very best results. This may have easily come from the pen of Wolfgang Puck or Mario Batali.<br />The individual recipe writing is detailed in the extreme, and recipes typically run to two to three times as long as you may see in `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery'. The recipes are also very `modular'. A single recipe may actually require the cooking of two or three component preparations. This is not an invention of Julia Child. I believe she has captured here an essential characteristic of French culinary tradition. The most common of these advance preparations is a stock. More complicated examples are to make a potato salad, a dish in itself, as a component to a Salade Nicoise. What Child may have originated, at least to the world of American cookbook writing, is the notion of a Master Recipe, where many different dishes are presented as variations on a basic preparation. This notion has been used and misused for decades.<br />This book has become so important in its field that it seems almost irreverent to question the quality of the recipes. I can only say that I have prepared several dishes from these pages, and have always produced a tasty dish and learned something new with each experience. While there are other excellent introductions to French Cooking such as Madeline Kamman's `The New Making of a Chef', one simply cannot go wrong by using this book as ones entree into cooking in general and French cooking in particular.<br />The more I read other cooking authorities' writing, the more I respect the work of Julia Child and company. Observations on technique that went right over my head two years ago are now revealed as signs of a deep insight into cooking technique.<br />As large as the book is, the material presented to Knopf in 1961 was actually much larger and the second volume of the book is largely material created for the original writing. To get a reasonably complete picture of French Cookery, do get both volumes at the same time.<br />A true classic with both simple and advanced techniques. A superb introduction for someone who is just beginning an interest in food.e also very `modular'. A single recipe may actually require the cooking of two or three component preparations.

B00006LLLN|5.0|This DVD and CD is so full of life and if there was any more musical talent and ability I think the audience would've spontaniously combusted. The DVD is so wonderful, I enjoy Alison's willingness to poke fun at herself and her music without disparaging herself or Union Station in any way.
B00006LLNU|5.0|in response to the review below me, you've just gotta let it take you where it takes you, not where it takes everyone else. personally for me this music is escape, and i just imagine sunny, warm days leaving the place of dread and moving on to more excitement and peace, if those could exist at the same time. its really peaceful to me. starting from depression it seems to go to a new day, where you can for once feel warmth and love, and everything you couldnt feel the day before, as you were trapped within yourself. a new beginning, thats what this album means to me. so anyways, try to see the 3-d picture if you want, dont like it if you want, no biggie. all you need is patience and a will to find what you're missing.
B00018D44U|4.0|The better the first the harder it is to get a better second isn't it? This album will not get any Grammy but it's not a crap too. It's just not as good as the first and the first is so great.<BR>May be because I love anything jazzy, my threshold of greatness for them is a little low so this album is still among the best!<BR>Keep striving for more Norah!
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time, which makes it even because Nirvana the greatest band of all time. This cd you can listen to hit over and over again. It will never ever get old. This cd is 14 years old, and it still stands as the greatest band of all time. This band really defines grunge music. After Kurts death there is no more grunge for some reason. This cd is the ultimate grunge album. Even if you like alternitave, punk or heavy meatal you will still love it. This cd has the song that made nirvana popular, &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;, which is a good song but not the best. <br />If you just bought the cd is suggest you heir the best song, track seven &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;. And the best acoustic song &quot;Polly&quot;. But I love all songs especially &quot;come as you are&quot;. Also &quot;In bloom&quot;, Drain you&quot;, and something in the way. Also in the end of &quot;something in the way&quot;, if you keep listening you will heir the secret song &quot;endless nameless&quot;. <br />This is a definate must for grunge fanatics
0743216458|5.0|This is one of my ALL time favorites. I loved it and I know that you will too!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!<br />Dr. Michael L. Johnson author of &quot;What Do You Do When the Medications Don't Work?--A Non-Drug Treatment of Dizziness, Migraine Headaches, Fibromyalgia, and Other Chronic Conditions&quot;.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|As a long time Clapton fan, Rock fan, and Blues fan I can honestly say this CD did nothing for me. At least it doesn't contain the Drum machine and other slick tricks of his last couple outings! I think I could find something better to listen to in at least a dozen local bars on a Saturday night. <br />I love all the people who played on the CD but they just weren't kickin' it like they should. The tribute CD &quot;Hellhound On My Trail&quot;  is much more interesting.<br />If the vocals had been a little rougher around the edges it would have been far better. I can only imagine Robert Johnson  playing smokey bars, loud and loose, but this CD seems more like a Sunday afternoon for the family in the park.
0440236304|5.0|Donald Burgett is one of my favorite authors.  He puts you smack in the middle of the action with his superb writing ability.

B0001YRVN4|5.0|Whether you're 30 years old or just turning to 6, you would be a fool not to buy this piece of Sci-fi history. George Lucas practically puts you in the film with the extreme high depth images. You can practically feel the emotion that was there 30+ years ago when Lucas first gave us Episode 4: A New Hope.<br />I think my favorite one was Empire Strikes Back when you saw Luke and Han in the snow and Luke was using the Tauntaun for shelter. I pity the poor man that actually has to do that in the future. But that's just me.<br />I cannot recommend enough that you buy this DVD set except to say that at the very least, you are saving $27.
6305922756|2.0|I have followed Spinal Tap very sporadically over the years, mostly since their buzz after the release of this film (I honestly remember hearing very little about them during the seventies).  After viewing this documentary, I believe the filmmaker could have done better both in his editing choices and his choice of bands.  <br />While Spinal Tap is capable of turning out the occasional catchy tune, it's obvious watching this film that they were/are basically one-trick ponies.  Whether that's the fault of the editor, I can't say.  I will say that viewing this film made me only want the hits (collected on the film's soundtrack) and it did not give me the desire to seek out their earlier work (&quot;Shark Sandwich&quot; and &quot;Intravenous De Milo&quot;, both of which seem to be out of print anyway).<br />I guess my real complaint is with the filmmakers, as I'm wondering why they chose to cover such a little-known group when there were perfectly acceptable alternatives: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Eddie Money, and/or Motorhead.  Spinal Tap may have been an interesting story, but they're hardly a band worth making immortal through film.
B00003CXCT|3.0|FINALLY, Lucas and Fox are putting the trilogy to DVD!  But wait, if the reviews are true, then my excitement quickly turns to trepidation.  The Lucas people may be inventing brand new horrors for this \\"extra-special\\" edition.  Forget the \\"purist\\" argument.  I can understand the feeling that a project is never really finished, just abandoned.  My argument is more one of ethics - just because you can doesn't mean you should. <br />I'm sure this path was paved with good intentions. But Lucas and Co. have seemingly lost all ability to appreciate the aesthetic value of flaws, as they continue to \\"improve\\" and polish these films into glossy soulless caricatures.  If higher cinematic quality was really the ambition, they'd re-write the cheesy dialogue.  But see, it's those gritty, sometimes silly, qualities of the original films that endeared them to us.  <BR>           <BR>So, is this extra-special edition the product of Lucas' ego running wildly out of control like an ADHD kid on a sugar-bender?  Or is it the production company's marketing strategy to release endless \\"new\\" versions over the years, thus bleeding the maximum cash from the devoted?  Perhaps a synergy between the two?  Only time will tell.  Regardless, in this age of deluxe multi-disc packaging, would it have been so hard to release both versions and make the public happy (c'mon Fox, you did it with the Alien series)?<br />I only wish Lucas, ILM, and Fox would use their collective cash and creativity to make better \\"new\\" Star Wars films, rather than waste it on the repeated resurrection and digital thrashing of our old beloved dead-horse.
B0001907DA|2.0|As a former academy dropout myself, it's a little hard to watch these films and laugh. They're simply so inaccurate as to be incredibly annoying.  I mean, if our actual academies were anything like this, what would our law enforcement look like?  Whew!  It may be funny to laugh at, but I say let's all be thankful that these are just films, right?
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Firstly, don't dismiss my review because of the low rating. I want to see Dream Theater do as well as you do, however I have to be honest: this CD was disappoting, and worse than average. Firstly, what is up with the lyrics? They're not totally bad, but it's pretty mediocre at many times, and doesn't seperate them among the rest of the average prog-metal crowd. Most of the songs are overly long, predictable and insultingly boring. There is absolutely no point in having the same riff repeated over and over, with little change in melody. This is shocking in comparison with their masterpiece, 'A Change of Seasons'. I give them credit for the catchy and &quot;nice&quot; riffs used though; they could be better if they weren't repeated so much. This brings me to another problem, they are overplaying their respective instruments. Take the solo in 'As I Am' for example by John Petrucci: absolutely unnecessary and unneeded. What purpose does it serve? I'm aware it's technically impressive but please realise that technicality is useless in a lot of cirucumstances if its effect isn't pleasurable to hear. Portnoy's drumming is creative at times, but it's still more of the same. I cannot understand why people claim him to be an A-grade drummer; he's not. He overplays, just like the other musicians. I must say that LaBrie has improved in some ways, but his voice doesn't have the strong presence it did on 'Scenes From a Memory'. It's good enough though, and creative at times. <br />Jordon Rudess also suffers from the overplaying syndrome. I was  about to lost consciousness (sorry) during the end of 'Stream of Consciousness' because it's so dreadully long, boring and serves no purpose. Wanking is the term many use, and it applies here. Wow, you can perform duets with the guitar - it's not amazing stuff. I preferred in SFAM, again (at most times).<br />If you're considering this album to be your next purchase, don't do so, there's much better music out there, believe it or not. Thefunny thing is, it seems quite common that only the biggest of fanboys claim this album is great; this only solidifies the opinion that anything Dream Theater does is great. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but this is below than average stuff. I'm sure DT's next release will put 'Train of Thought' to shame, at least I hope so.
B0000AGQ26|1.0|This &quot;classic&quot; both confuses and saddens me.  I am one of the very few people in this world who feels like our nation's universities should be places of higher learning and striving to better oneself.  Thanks to movies such as this and the horrific &quot;Old School&quot;, colleges have become partying first, studying second.  And it's heartbreaking.<br />I can't tell you what to buy, but I can encourage you to consider what you're supporting.  There are plenty of ways to view a schooling system that works, namely &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;.  Don't contribute to the downfall of our schools.  I'm just asking you to care.
B00006IU73|5.0|Wow, this is hot, accessable and it's completely delicious. Soft, catchy and dream-like melodies are present throughout the album, and make for an experience not to be missed. I cannot stress how efficient and perfect the production is: probably the best I've heard. Steve Wilson has been claimed to be a genius by many. I agree. <br />'Blackest Eyes' starts off with a catchy, digestable riff. The vocals are pop-like, and leaves you wanting more. Thankfully it leads on to 'Trains', a song everyone in the world should hear. It's beautifully complete, with everything seeming properly in place. The next two songs are equally as catchy, with the latter, 'The Sound of Muzak' spurring an emotional and heart-wrenching guitar solo, which is highly appropriate to me. The instrumental songs are equally as superb; I once again cannot stress enough. The entire album is gold, it's wonderful. 'Heartattack in a Layby' is very, very moving. Smoky lyrics accompany the simple but effective piano and guitar riffs. I could cry when Steven sings, &quot;I could do with fresh air&quot; and, &quot;We'll grow old.. together&quot;. Oh so, amazingly, beautifully, positively amazing. Please, just order this album.<br />One of the key effects of the album is that it _creates_ an atmosphere and environment perfectly suited to the song. This is the power of the band; no one should miss this. The last song finishes the album off in an expected and quite predictable way; simple melody, but certainly not a let-down. The keyboards are once again in full force, with Steven Wilson singing catchy words. It's simple, but serves well for the album. <br />In closing, if you haven't got the message, order this album immediately. You can thank me for it later. It grabs you in a way you have to listen to the entire thing altogether. After all, it is a concept album, I'm told. Few albums are as moving as this, they sure are a rarity. Don't be left out. This is essential.
B000003TAR|5.0|NEVERMIND and UNPLUGGED seem to get all the attention, while IN UTERO is reduced to a Nirvana footnote.  Strange, since the album is nearly as good as NEVERMIND.  <br />IN UTERO was also more accessible than it's given credit for.  In addition to HSB, AA, and Dumb, I'd say RM, FFWHHROS, PT, and STS all could've had strong radio runs (even without Cobain's death).  <br />The only sub-par moments on IN UTERO would be MI and Tourette's, but the abundance of exceptional songs more than make up for them.  <br />A stunning achievement...
B000002NFM|5.0|I bought this cd several years ago and it is still my favorite.  I love all of the songs, except for the last one.  If your wondering what happened to them, some of them had some disagreements and wanted out, but their still around and their going to be coming out with a new cd.  I'm not going to rant on and on how great Prodigy is, and how there music is amazing.  But this is one of the best techno cd's of all time, so YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD.
0767830555|5.0|You already know that this is a classic film.  What makes the DVD worth owning is the fascinating making-of documentary that accompanies it.  <br />Schraeder, Scorcese, De Niro, Foster, Brooks, and Keitel all share their memories of the film's inception, production, and reception upon release.  Their insights and recollections are actually worth hearing, and the documentary as a whole makes you wonder why most other DVDs have such useless extras.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban really outdid himself in this album. I love all of the songs. I know all of them by heart [even the Italian, French, Spanish ones] This should be a definite BUY on your list.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I went with a couple of friends to see Moulin Rouge in the theater.  We all came away feeling blown away.  Even today I can visualize The Duke, during the \\"Like a Virgin\\" segment, looking into the camera and quiveringly explaining \\"Feels so good inside...\\" and it makes me laugh.    I am quite pleased with the DVD version, although my only complaint is that the menus are a little hard to navigate.  They just aren't that intuitive and, for example, to find the \\"Lady Marmelade\\" Lil Kim, et al, video you really have to dig deep.    Overall though, this is a fun energy filled movie, quite worth watching repeatedly, especially for some of the musical numbers.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|It is hard to make a movie this bad.  But The Wachowski Brothers have accomplished that feat with The Matrix Revolutions.  This movie is jaw-droppingly, utterly awful!  First off, there's a huge 30-minute battle sequence between the machines and Zion that gave me a migraine after watching it, we see Sentinels flying around and getting shot, humans getting torn up...what a loud, stinking mess.  Then the thing about the Trainman, a conduit between two worlds that Neo travels to get to the French dude (Merovingian).  There's this big sign called &quot;Mobil Ave.&quot;  Is this some kind of product placement for ExxonMobil?  Speaking of product placements, there's one for Powerade (you can't miss it).  But never mind about all that, the whole purpose of The Matrix Revolutions is for Neo to find peace, and he and Agent Smith duke it out in the Super Brawl, which lasts about, oh, 2 minutes.  They bounce off each other, because Smith and Neo are equal and like charges repel and opposites attract.  Smith defeats Neo, then says &quot;Everything has a beginning has an end&quot; and he loses.  Oh, yeah, if you haven't figured out by now, Bane is Smith in diguise.  End of story.  What a dreadful movie.  Don't waste your time watching it.

B000060MMI|5.0|I have to say that I do like Drunken Lullabies almost as much as I like swagger but not quite. It should get about a 4.8 or 4.9 stars because it didn't excite me as much as swagger but it's still great. Each song grows on you more and more. At first you think, yeah this band is cool, by the second or third time you hear a the song you think it's the best song ever!<br />Personal Favorites off of Drunken Lullabies:<BR>Drunken Lullabies, What's Left of the Flag, Rebels of the Sacred Heart and Swagger.
B00006V9A0|5.0|10 years ago today on April 5, 1994 in his home in Seattle, Washington, the lifeless body of Kurt Cobain was found. A brilliant artist and musician, Kurt Cobain composed some of the most memorable songs of his generation that touched not only his peers, but people from many age groups.  In 1988 with David Grohl (percussion) and Krist Novoselic (bass), Kurt picked up his guitar and formed the now legendary band Nirvana, which was one of the founding bands of the grunge movement that started in Seattle.  They recorded their first album, &quot;Bleach&quot;, in 1989 for a mere $600 with Seattle-based Sub Pop Records; but two years later, their breakthrough album &quot;Nevermind&quot; was recorded with Geffen Records.  Within a few months, people stopped listening to feel-good 1980's music and started listening to the darker sounds of grunge, led by Nirvana's song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, as well as songs by bands such as Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chains.  In the process, Kurt Cobain unintentionally came to symbolize not only grunge, but also the voice of an entire dissatisfied generation.  Following the hugely successful &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Nirvana returned to the recording studio and recorded an even darker album entitled &quot;In Utero&quot; in 1993.  Its songs, especially &quot;All Apologies&quot;, demonstrated the sadness that Kurt was feeling.  Sadly, &quot;In Utero&quot; became Nirvana's final fully recorded album, as Kurt took his own life only seven months later.<br />Thousands of people mourned the sudden loss of Kurt Cobain, though his widow, Courtney Love, blamed her husband's apparent suicide on pressure from the recording industry and from fans.  Though we may never fully understand Kurt's pain, we all shared the pain of his tragic loss.  Then, 8 years after his parting (and after some ugly litigation between Courtney Love with David Grohl and Krist Novoselic), fans were finally given the melancholy opportunity to hear Nirvana's final recorded, but previously unreleased song, &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;, on the 2002 compilation entitled simply &quot;Nirvana&quot;.  &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; demonstrated that Kurt's creative spark that launched Nirvana into the spotlight over 10 years ago had by no means gone out in spite of Kurt's internal pain.  Though there was never opportunity to rerecord the song in a more polished fashion, it may be more appropriate that it will forever remain a less polished recording, reminding everyone of Nirvana's humble roots before fame and fortune had the opportunity to torture Kurt.<br />A glimpse into Kurt's short, but brilliant life has been forever captured in the songs that transformed a generation over 10 years ago, and the songs on the 2002 compilation &quot;Nirvana&quot;, are primarily his best known, but by no means a complete representation of his creative gift.  The album begins with the previously unreleased &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;, followed by &quot;About a Girl&quot; from their first album &quot;Bleach&quot;.  Next, two songs that were released on the 1992 compilation of singles and previously unreleased songs, &quot;Incesticide&quot;, were included: &quot;Been a Son&quot; and &quot;Sliver&quot;.  Four songs from &quot;Nevermind&quot; are included: &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot; and &quot;In Bloom&quot;.  Four songs follow this from &quot;In Utero&quot;: &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, &quot;Rape Me&quot; and &quot;Dumb&quot;.  Two songs from the live MTV &quot;Unplugged in New York&quot; album include &quot;All Apologies&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;.<br />Overall, I rate the 2002 compilation &quot;Nirvana&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars.  Though an expanded two-disk compilation should be released in the coming months, it was well worth to get the 2002 compilation &quot;Nirvana&quot; to hear &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;.  Thank you Kurt for your many wonderful songs and creative light.  Be at peace.

0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi was an gripping tale of a small boy on a quest for faith. Lots of moments were you even question your self on your faith. But anyway,Pi and his family set off on a move from India to Canada. Along the way the ship they set sail on sinks. Everyone is lost but Pi and four animals from Pi's fathers zoo. Alone they set sail on the life raft. From there we get a gripping tail of survial and faith as Pi yearns to survive what should be certain death. Some graphic details of animal life and a twist in the ending with two alternative endings which will leave you in deep thoughts and horror and  faith. A fantastic book. Martell has a certain wit in some of his writing that even made me laugh out loud.
0385504209|3.0|This book is more a compendium of Mr. Brown's considerable research of his subject than a compelling novel of fiction.  The protagonists' quest is formula, and I knew who &quot;the Teacher&quot; was very early in the book.  Dialog seemed stilted, as well.<br />Methinks not nearly as much a thriller as advertised.
B000021YQV|4.0|This album is impossible to hate. I would find it hard to believe for a true rocker to dislike this album. It's got amazing drum parts that seem to change speeds from fast to slow, from soft to hard. The drums are also pretty much metal. The only thing they lack is the double bass and hard crashs. <BR>The bass was another key metal factor in this album. It's heavy and can be heard well throughout the album. It's heavy and creative, which is way different from most hard rock.<BR>The guitars are the most lacking part of the album. There is no originality in the parts and no solos. Other than that it's good hard rock. The vocals are totally kickass and will blow you away the first time you hear'em.
0385504209|3.0|Being a believer of Yaweh and Christ, but of no religion at all, I was interested in this book to learn how the non-christians look at the Jesus affair. I found it to be a very interesting novel with a nice amount of facts and creation of pseudo-facts by mere speculation using the real data. Good, light style makes this book an easy reading. But in some point, the plot loses itself in an ultimate try to end the story with a concience-rinse that reminds me of Pilatos hand washing. The author seems to get scared of his own story and pretends to build a finale that results in an excuse to those believers and christians that might result offended by its nature. If he went so far, why get back at the end and write a hollywoodesque end? My recommendation: read it, take the knowledge you find useful (like phi number, symbols, cryptology), then throw away the babble you confirm as such and go on. And don't tell my over-religious mom I've read it!!
B0000C0FJB|3.0|Bad sound production... period. On the bright side tho, \\"Rio\\" features a great song list including some lesser played songs (\\"Natural Science\\", \\"Vital Signs\\", \\"La Villa Strangiato\\", etc). It's a nice tri-fold package with some great band pictures containing 30 songs on 3 discs (and almost 3 hours of material). The liner notes with Neil's 6-page essay is a must read - and you'll read about all the trouble they had at this last show in Rio de Janeiro in front of 40,000 fans. I really have to question why RUSH felt the need to put out another 'live' recording with so few albums in between their last one (1998). Seems like everything they've EVER put out has been done with mathematical precision and state-of-the-art equipment. Through heavy winds, torential rains, an outdoor soccer stadium with no acoustics, and equipment shorting out due to being wet... and probably most importantly NO SOUND CHECK prior to the show... this project, in my opinion, was doomed from the start. Geddy's bass is overpowering, Alex's guitar is almost non-existent on many songs, and Neil's cymbals sound off - probably due to the water on his cymbals (as he stated in his article). I dig RUSH. I'm a long time fan from the late 1970's having seen many a brilliant concert and plunking down plenty of green for their material on vinyl as a kid and now on disc as an adult. I believe Geddy, Alex and especially Neil are master craftsman with their instruments. For me, \\"Different Stages\\" (1998) is still their absolute best 'live' release, followed closely by their hard, raw and crunchy first \\"All The World's A Stage\\" (1976). Warning - listen to \\"Rio\\" before you purchase.
B00005K3OT|4.0|If you want to know what's wrong with this movie, read a dozen or so of the one-star reviews. On the other hand, there must be something good about a film that inspires such hostility from such a bunch of bitter and cynical semi-literates. Personally, I empathized with the leading lady. I don't go to church, and I don't like what the Catholic church stands for --- although, as they say, many of my best friends are Catholics. One or two of the carpers said that offering chocolate to Catholics during Lent is like opening up a pork butcher's in a community of rigorously orthodox Jews. It isn't. The real point is that if people want to eat chocolate during Lent, why shouldn't they? And what right does anyone have to stop them? Chocolate is a fundamentally harmless substance, even if it's not good for diabetics. People's lives are their own: they don't belong to any community by right --- only by agreement. This is a beautifully shot film, charmingly and engagingly acted by an interesting and attractive cast. I can't quite include the Depp character in this generalization, as I didn't think his part was sufficiently well realized. However, I wouldn't say the piece was flawless otherwise. Perhaps it's because the theme is unresolved. It starts as a fantasy fable: this woman clearly arrives with her little daughter from nowhere, carrying impossibly heavy luggage, transported by nothing visible, wearing strange clothing. The wares she sells appear as if by magic. Is she some sort of witch from the Otherworld? It looks like it, but gradually it seems that she is human after all, and would just like to put down roots. Is this the point of it all --- that in the end we have to compromise? Cowboys have to be friends with farmers. It's all a little slight. The most genuinely tragic character is played by Peter Stormare, who is the real victim of this village life set-up, and he is just brushed out of the picture. An in-depth analysis of his fate and psyche would have opened up areally gripping can of worms. Too much to swallow, of course.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Fantastic 2 hour 18 song set from England's now famous site of many a rock concert - Donnington. 5.1 Dolby Surround fills your room with crisp sound. Great camera work. Rich colors. An overload of energy on stage with AC/DC members (Brian Johnson - vocals, Angus &amp; Malcolm Young - guitars, Chris Slade - bass, and Cliff Williams - drums). Absolutely huge crowd scenes - more than any show I've ever scene - on TV or in person. Roving (helicopter) ariel camera shots. Massive speakers making the Young brothers look like minature rug-rats prancing around on stage. This was truly the definition of a monster show. Check out the guitar solo's on &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, &quot;Hell's Bells&quot;, and &quot;High Voltage&quot; - simply amazing Angus! Great 1991 show and thanks for putting this out finally on DVD with superior sound.<br />A great song list midway through AC/DC's &quot;Razors Edge&quot; tour:<br />1. Thunderstruck, 2. Shoot To Thrill, 3. Back In Black, 4. Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be, 5. Heatseeker, 6. 6. Fire Your Guns, 7. Jailbreak, 8. The Jack, 9. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, 10. Moneytalks, 11.

B000005H55|5.0|Recorded four months prior to Dolphy's (diabetes associated) death is his best selling album &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; with the stunningly amazing drumming of 18-year old Tony Williams, and the great musicianship by vibraphone-virtuoso Bobby Hutcherson (23 at the time) and 25-year old trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Dolphy plays all three instruments he was known for playing - all equally, and with equal out-of-this-world skill; alto sax, flute, and bass clarinet. The changes of melody and solo instruments are really refreshing. The album also features the experienced, regular Dolphy bass player Richard Davis, known for working with jazz-artists such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Zawinul, but also with artists like Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand. He has played classical music under the lead of Boulez, Stravinsky, Stokowski, and Leonard Bernstein as well. Here he--and his team mates--gives the music great justice to say the least; Dolphy seems to bring out a side in all these musicians that they probably hadn't gotten to, and do not get to, release daily in their playing. The quality of the ensemble playing is chilling; to say the very least it's in a class of its own, especially when considering that this music is recorded in early 1964!<br />To either warn or encourage people about this album, I must point out that it is very far from another &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;; a lot of these eccentric themes are played over eccentric forms as well - some in 5/4, some in 9/4. If you have heard and liked Dolphy's playing anywhere else, you will LOVE this. Part of what differs the mood of this album from jazz-albums of its time, is that not a note is heard from a piano; Hutchersons's vibes really set an original mood. I've listened through this recording at least 50 times, and every time I listen I get surprises, and hear something new that chills me. Without this album Dolphy wouldn't be spoken of as much as he is now. It's his most interesting album, with most variety, and with an exceptionally good sound quality. The music of Eric Dolphy should really be given a genre-title of its own - maybe &quot;eccentric jazz&quot;?resting album, with most variety, and with an exceptionally good sound quality.

B0000025KI|4.0|Bruce Springsteen was driven to superstardom in 1975 with BORN TO RUN which followed two little-acknowledged albums. In 1978 came DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN,and two years later came this album,Bruce Springsteen's first megahit. This a two CD set like the 2 LP set. Every song was composed,both words and music,by Springsteen. Hits from this album are HUNGRY HEART,the title track,FADE AWAY,THE TIES THAT BIND and RAMROD. I heard OUT IN THE STREET on the radio also. Only the title track and HUNGRY HEART have been recycled for 1995's GREATEST HITS. Springsteen mentions actor Burt Reynolds,in a Trans Am,on CADILLAC RANCH. Another car song is RAMROD. Another song involving cars is WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY. And DRIVE ALL NIGHT is another. And THE PRICE YOU PAY is another. SHERRY DARLING involves cars also(&quot;Your mama's yappin' in the back seat&quot;). And so does STOLEN CAR of course! Man,this album is full of car songs just like the songs recorded by the Beach Boys and Jan &amp; Dean in the sixties. A major nationwide tour followed the release of this album. Springsteen also performed at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford,NJ just after it opened in early 1981.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I was not dissapointed at all to this DVD and throughly enjoyed it. Angus is not only a great guitarist, but he also the most energetic I've ever seen on film, TV, or in-person. If you're an AC/DC fan and don't have this DVD, what are you waiting for?
B0000AXE8I|3.0|When i first saw the original matrix movie i thought it was one of the best.. it had like so many styles in a movie like no other. Then i saw this movie (matrix: Reloaded) the 2nd part in the trilogy i was kind of disapointed. The fight scenes were so good though, better then the first matrix expecially with Neo's arch enemy. It though i thought was unnecessarily long for the fact that its dragged into a 2-part chapter (or whatever).  I actually thought that the Starwars series (4, 5 &amp; 6) were better cuz the fact they always showed u something worthwhile. But of course now thats hollywood's idea of making money. However though the actual plot of this first half was still very good, i had to admit after seeing this movie for a 2nd time i was infact more pleased. Maybe because i understood more or the fact that its on dvd &amp; i can scan through diff areas on which i thought were boring parts (the celebration which isnt the only part). I did though watch it all the way, but still dint need a whole lot of scenes.. well at least to some people they got thier money's worth. I on the other hand had to pay $8.50 to see it once while normally i could have seen it for $4.. so no i dint get my money's worth, lol. This is still a good movie &amp; if you have seen the first one, rent this one first to see if you like it.. now since revolutions is out you can rent that one if your curious.. anyways this movie is my least fav out of the trilogy..<br />Matrix (my favorite)<br />Matrix: Reloaded (my least favorite)<br />Matrix: Revolutions (its my mid favorite dude)
B00009V7P8|4.0|Wow. That's the word i would use to describe &quot;O,&quot; the debut album from Irish crooner Damien Rice. Aside from one or maybe two songs, this record is near perfect. Rice wears his heart on his sleeve and his guitar on his lap as he accompanies himself through 10 heart wrenched ballads. Another nice touch is the lovely voice of singer Lisa Hannigan, who joins Rice on about half of the songs. This one is a must have for any fan of folk, acoustic, or slightly Celtic music.<br />Rating: Four and a half stars.
B000002UAI|3.0|Though not as good as any Beatles album that would follow, 'Beatles For Sale' proves to be the first true 'wrinkle' in their long and winding (no pun intended) musical progression all the way to their grande finale (unbelievably only 4 and a half years later), 'Abbey Road'. This is the first Beatles album that finds the Fab Four no longer virgins to a certain 'natural substance' thanks in large part to that folk legend we all know so well just a few months earlier while they were on their 'Hard Days Night' tour. Not only are their faces on the cover an illustration to their weariness with 'Beatlemania' (as depicted in 'Compleat Beatles' which, by the way, is the greatest Beatles-documentary ever), but check out their faces in the INNER-cover as well - they're definitely, whoever subtle, under SOME influence; and not just musically either. Despite this 4th album of theirs again - like previous works - showing strong Chuck Berry/Buddy Holly-influence, quite a bit of Dylan (spearheaded mainly by Lennon - ex. 'I'm A Loser') shows in this as well. 'I'll Follow the Sun' also compliments that folkish sound that would be used even more in their next offering, 'Help'. Yes, 'Sgt. Pepper' is still just a bit down the road yet, but this album demonstrates the turn-in-direction that has already been made. What a way to end the very year they invaded America - with even more promise!

0321146530|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, however I must advise that non-coders will probably have difficulty in staying with it. I don't mean that as a put-down of any kind. It's obvious that the intended audience is the developer who is trying to understand the concept of test-driven development. A tester, however, would learn in this book that test-driven development uses tests that are different in nature and rigor than those commonly thought of as \\"unit tests.\\"<br />I think Beck does a good job in explaining test-driven development in a way that is easy to understand. I still have some concerns about the nature of test-driven development, such as the emphasis on function over design. But I think Beck achieved a reasonable goal of presenting by example what test-driven development is all about.<br />The goal of test-driven development is a reasonable way to achieve \\"clean code that works - now.\\" As a tester, I think the awareness of test-driven development is a good thing. I also think that this technique must be combined with other methods, such as getting quality requirements, verification and validation, to achieve a final result that meets the users' needs.<br />Readability - 4<br />Coverage of topics - 5<br />Depth of coverage - 5<br />Credibility - 5<br />Accuracy - 5<br />Relevance to software quality - 5<br />Overall - 5

B0001BKAEY|4.0|With the first Matrix (meaning the actual film, not the perfect world :) ), I loved it immediately. It was, and still is IMHO, a perfect sci-fi film. It's one of the greatest ever.<br />With Reloaded, it took time for it to grow on me. I liked it, but didn't love it like the first one. The burly brawl, the highway chase scene, and overall story was cool, but there were just some things about it that weren't necessary.<br />With Revolutions, I liked it right away. Maybe it was because of all the cool war scenes and seeing the machine city. Maybe it was Deus Ex Machina. Maybe it was the super burly brawl between Smith and Neo. Maybe it was the fact that there wasn't a pointless and overly long sex/party scene in Zion this time. Or maybe it was all those reasons, but the point is that I liked this one right way, and better than Reloaded.<br />Revolutions does have its flaws. Everyone went in expected all of their questions to be answered, and what they got was \\"Hey, watch the Animatrix, play \\"Enter the Matrix\\" on your XBox or PS2, and browse the internet to find all the answers\\" instead. This movie hardly offered any explanations. Some were there, but they were very, very vague and easily overlooked. With any other questions, you have to do some research outside of watching the film. Most people don't want to do that. We don't want it all spelled out for us, but we want to be able to watch a film and understand what's going just by doing that. Anything like the Animatrix anime DVD or the Enter the Matrix video game should just be extra goodies, not required material.<br />But, the movie does make sense after doing some research on the net. I'm not going to go into why it does, but it pretty much works IMHO. (...)Check out this link to read something I read that helped out a lot: [...]<br />(...)The story is quite unique and interesting. It's action-packed. The war in Zion has just about all I wanted to see. The only thing that would've made it better would be if Neo and Trinity were fighting at Zion as well. We don't see them for about a half hour of the film, because they're off going to the machine city. It was cool and all, but I think they could've found a way to do both.<br />And what's wrong with the sunrise scene? It seems like a lot of people are complaining about that, but I really don't have a problem with the ending at all.<br />Anyway, good movie, good DVD.d Trinity were fighting at Zion as well. We don't see them for about a half hour of the film, because they're off going to the machine city. It was cool and all, but I think they could've found a way to do both.<br />And what's wrong with the sunrise scene? It seems like a lot of people are complaining about that, but I really don't have a problem with the ending at all.<br />Anyway, good movie, good DVD.

B000000NN4|4.0|Great instrumentation, and programming that Vangelis is truly great at.  Synthesizers, and great drum programming, especially on the track Alpha, in fact you'll have Alpha on repeat for days.  Pulstar opens the album, and really sets the tone, amazing!
B00004RERW|5.0|The vocal power of the unsinkable Celine Dion has taken new form through the medium of Sony's Super Audio CD.  Using 21st century DSD (Direct Sound Digital) technology, this collection of many of Celine's greatest hits and new favorites is reproduced in flawless sound.  To the avid SACD listener, this album is sure to become a favorite, even among listeners to whom Celine seems over-played and over-done.<br />The intricacy of each track, beautifully remixed into 5.1 Surround, is breathtaking.  From the full-length version of the album's opening ballad `The Power of Love,' to the final track `Live For The One I Love,'  (an English translation of a popular French song from the musical `Notre Dame De Paris') the listener is immersed in a rich environment of sound incomparable to the regular CD version of the album.<br />`Its All Coming Back To Me Now,'  `To Love You More,' and `I Want You To Need Me' are three songs that come across especially well through their SACD translation.  Each song features an immense dynamic range and several layers of sound which each speak clearly through the five speaker channels.  Celine's powerful vocals are perfectly balanced with the instrumentation to create near musical perfection.<br />The definite high point of the album is the unforgettable `My Heart Will Go On.'  By the song's second chorus, Celine is backed by a full choir who's presence in three dimensional sound adds so much depth to the piece.  Through the awe inspiring climax featuring larger than life electric guitar and fall-to-your-knees orchestral might, all the way to the subtle ending chords, this version of `My Heart Will Go On' is a must have for any SACD or Celine Dion enthusiast.<br />In all, `All The Way. . . A Decade Of Song' is a crown jewel, and proof of the outstanding potential of the SACD.  Like its counterpart, Celine Dion's `A New Day Has Come' on SACD, this disc is sure to become a standard item in the next generation of home listening technology.  A MUSTHAVE!!
B00007ELF2|5.0|As you may already know Traffic is a movie about the U.S. drug problem that deals with the issue on all fronts. Traffic is not really an action movie or a drama but it has elements of both. It is more like a fictionalized documentary showing how drugs affect cops, politicians, families, and many others on both side of the border.<br />      Traffic's plot consists of three interwoven tales that all focus on the issue of drugs. Benecio del Toro plays a mexican cop that struggles to fight two immense drug cartels. Catherine Zeta Jones plays a naive, pregnant wife that is thrown off the deep end into drugs when her husband gets arrested for drug trafficking. Michael Douglass plays a newly promoted politician whose job is to lead the fight on the war on drugs. There are many other supporting roles that delicately fill in the gaps between the three basic situations.<br />       Traffic is unique in that there no lead roles in the move. Each story is given equal face time and importance. The notorious color differentiation between the stories is clever, but really nothing more. Overall this movie is very informative and revealing of the actualities of the war on drugs. Much of it is common sense but many subtle contradictions and fallacies are exposed that show why the current policy cannot work (an example is the emphasis of curtailing the dealers and Topher Grace's character explains why dealers are a product of the demand for goods and not vica-versa)<br />      Overall, I found traffic to be an excellent and revealing movie. However, this movie does seem to possess that polarizing effect on people. So, I suggest shoveling out a few bucks to rent it and give it a try.
0385510438|3.0|I felt the book was fascinating ive always had an interest towards different societies in the US but Grisham disapointed me ive read some of his other works and this one surprised me to be one of his slower ones.  The book was not a page turner.  He could have ended it several times but drabbed on for too long.  By the last third of the book i was nearly ready to put it down.  But i kept through classic Grisham ending which was worth the wait to an extent.
B000002H33|5.0|Not that most metalheads didn't know this. Don't get me wrong a love black sabbath (the greatest contributors to the great genre known as metal)and many other legendary metal bands (priest, maiden, motorhead, megadeth, anthrax, slayer, pantera...) but no band can match the anger, intensity, attitude, and brilliance of this album. While metallica may have flashes of material that compare to anything on puppets, nothing can compete with this cd as an entire album. <br />     The starts off with the intense thrasher battery and does not let go. From there the tracks all flow well together and feel like on giant song that kicks serious a$$. While some portions of puppets might be stronger than others the entire album is flows very well and immediately transfixes the listener. The track list includes the immensely popular the thing that should not be and the title track, the creepy and dark sanitarium, the anger filled yet depressing disposable heroes and leper messiah. Then the intrumental masterpiece orion (easily the most compelling and finest intrumental ever recorded). The album closes where it began: another thrasher in the form of damage inc. <br />     Master of puppets is the single greatest statement made in the heavy metal. Complex, brutal, passionate, yet musically brilliant at the same time. Its obvious that if you don't own and worship this then you cannot even begin to call yourself a metalhead.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I had heard so much about this film that when it came outI kept putting it off, because those are the movies that for me never live up to the hype. I try to see &quot;hyped&quot;  movies the first day before I can have preconceived ideas that make me expect to much. So when it came out on  dvd last week I bought it figuring enough time had passed for me to enjoy it. Besides how bad could a movie with Jack and Diane be? Well  I enjoyed it ,understood Diane's character and wanted the movie not to end. To me the true test of a classic movie for me is that I will want to watch it again. This is a feel good, glad to have it in my &quot;classic&quot; collection&quot; movie. I also like any dvd that has behind the scenes director's thoughts ect. To me this is what makes DVD's different from vhs. This movie had great extra's and I can't wait to watch it all again. A movie like this is like a great wine it get's better each time I watch it.
B000060P79|1.0|It's sad to see kids listen to this crap not knowing about great rock bands like Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Pearl Jam, The Beatles, and Metallica. But I can understand why, MTV forces these bands into their shows and little middle schoolers see it and think its cool and listen to it and love it. Its not their fault they listen to this junk, I listened to Blink 182 Enema of the State and actually thought it was one of the greatest CDs of all time. Yeah ill admit this kind of music is catchy but if you really heard other bands that could rock then this starts to sound terrible. Im not bashing Simple Plan because they sound good enough to be popular but I'm just saying theres music that makes this seem like total crap.
B000002OX7|5.0|This album has certainly lived up to my standards. This album sentimentally expresses Pete Townshend's angst towards society. This album is wonderful, if you cant get the new version get the old one, both will be equally enjoyable. Regarding the new version with added songs- the original album with something extra: main highlitw is Pure and easy, recorded in 1971, and I dont even know myself. If you can find it, get the 73 version of Pure and Easy. This album will bring you hours of joy, time and time again.
0688163173|2.0|I am a huge fan of Lehane's novels, having spent the past few months reading his entire body of work.  But while his other novels push the edge of crime fiction to the boarders of literature, Stutter Island fell flat half way through the book.<br />Perhaps having read his other novels, I am learning how he thinks, so the &quot;surprise&quot; ending was as obvious as an elephant walking down the street in a tux, drinking lemonade.  Parts of the novel are hard to follow, but the worst sin of all is the lack of a single character I could honestly care about.  If this is your first Lehane novel, do not give up hope, his other books are great and you will be well rewarded to read them all.<br />Every author stumbles from time to time, and Lehane will return to form and deliver more great works in the future, he has all the talent needed to do so. But Stutter Island is one trip you might want to avoid.
B000002AGB|3.0|Well, for the good part of this album, which is towards the beginning, I would say that the band is entergetic, with precision, and sounding great. The first half of the show introduces songs fans had not yet heard: Water, I dont even know myself, the upcoming Heaven and Hell, and a few others. Excuse me, now for the bad part: this album's sound quality is quite poor, if your trying to play along with this you have to bust your speakers to hear it, sadly Moon's drumming collapses halfway through the show as he becomes increasingly intoxictaed. This album is great the first time, but becomes less enjoyable over time.
B00005QCYC|4.0|&quot;This is just a delay. All major theme parks have delays. When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked.&quot;<BR>&quot;Yeah john, but if Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't EAT the tourists.&quot;<BR> - John Hammond and Ian Malcom<br />When Steven Spielberg makes an adventure movie, you can be assured that whatever comes on the screen, it's going to be exciting. Since seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark, I had waited to see a movie that evoked the same feeling of wonder, adventure, character, and adrenaline that made Dr. Jones's first adventure a classic. Then, once the first trailer for Jurassic Park rolled before Aladdin in 1992, I knew I had found one.<br />An avid dinosaur fan since toddler age, any sort of dinosaur movie sounded like a good idea in the early ninteies. However, Jurassic Park was in a class of its own when released, and remains so today. Based on the Micheal Crichton book of the same name, Spielberg's Messazoic adventure centers around a theme park where dinosaurs have been cloned through fossilized DNA found in mosquitos. Sure, the science isn't rock-solid, but it's more than a usuable base for a fantastic adventure yarn. The action picks up when a greedy employee causes a power outage, and the dinosaurs get loose, terrorising the visitors.<br />All the principal cast in the first movie was fantastic, bringing life and distinct personality to the characters. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs. Created by both Industrial Light and Magic and Stan Winston, the creative geniuses behind Terminator 2, the digital and animatronic creations were absolutely mind-blowing in 1993, and still hold up today. It could have overwhelmed the movie, but Spielberg has always known how to use special effects to enhance the story, and use action and character to advance it. Jurassic Park is a case study in fantastic pacing, fun characters, and tense action/adventure. 5/5<br />In 1997, Universal released a sequel, again based on a Micheal Crichton novel. The Lost World: Jurassic Park, again helmed by Spielberg, featured more characters, more dinosaurs, bigger effects, and bigger action. Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcom, a man who has fallen on hard times after the incident on Isla Nublar. When he finds that there is another island with dinosaurs on it, one there there are no fences to constrain them, he is appalled, and wants nothing to do with the operation to doccument the animals until he learns that his girlfriend is already on the island.<br />Once we reach the second site, the movie hits the ground running, providing thrills and chills from both the dinosaurs and the greedy human hunters who want to expoit the island to bail out their failing company. However, though the action is solid, the story is a little on the weak side, and Sam Neill's Alan Grant is sorely missed, as he brought so much to the first film. However, The Lost World is still a good way to spend an afternoon if you're looking for some good prehistoric fun. 4/5<br />Jurassic Park III saw far less hype and a smaller scope than either of its predecessor's. Helmed by Jumanji's Joe Johnston, Jurassic Park III features the return of Sam Neill as Alan Grant, an aging scientist who sees his field's support dimishing quickly. When a wealthy magnate offers him a large sum of money to give them an arial tour of Site B, he accepts.<br />What he doesn't know is that the couple is, in reality, looking for their lost son, who disappeared on the island two weeks earlier. In their race to find the boy, Grant, his assistant, and the parents get in a mess of trouble with a T-rex, an over-sized Spinosaurus, and a vengeful pack of Velociraptors.<br />Though the story is fairly weak in the third outing, the narrative is focused. Johnston uses tight direction and the character conflict along withe hungry dinosaurs to keep the movie going. The action begins in the opening sequence, and for the next hour and a half, it rarely lets up. There are some great set pieces including some high-flying antics with some nasty pterosaurs, and a tense stand-off with the raptors. The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't overstay its welcome. It builds to a great climax, and once it's over, the movie is done, keeping everything tight and fun all the way through. 4/5<br />Overall, these are some fatnastic dinosaur movies, and the extras on the DVDs are well worth the wait. Overall: 4/5
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This movie was only one star better than the first.  As an avid fan of the series (the games), I have a hard time appreciating the fact that the movies keep giving her a male to lean on. It also becomes quite annoying that the movie-tie-ins allude to the game, but not the movie.  The  movie leaves you torn between great stunts, and hope that as she flies away the credits will roll.
B00000JGHM|5.0|heat in many way's can be noted as one of the greatest movies of all time. heat explores the life's of all the characters and even let's a bad guy get away for once. The performances are wonderful here for a cast who's never really work together before.  people say the best part of this movie is the bank robbery but its not just that, that is great it is the plot itself. you see romance that is never really fixed. you see friendship and the problems it is that put all these people together
1572814349|5.0|Like some of the other reviewers, I too have collected a number of tarot decks over the years, always searching for that one perfect deck. Some I've bought have come close, while others I have eventually gotten rid of for lack of interest or utility.<br />The Golden Tarot Deck not only fulfills all I have looked for in a tarot deck, it surpasses what I have looked for. As I will use this deck primarily, I may just buy another one in case I wear this one out!<br />As others have already noted, I was amazed at the price for such a sumptous deck. I have bought decks that cost more than this one that were not even close to this level of execution or quality. The box the deck comes in is very sturdy and beautiful. The accompanying book slides in nicely with the cards so that you can carry both around.<br />As for the deck, it is richly detailed, gorgeously colored and, for, someone like me who prefers the Rider Waite icnography, this desk is both familiar and strange in that the imagery of RW is still there, but with new interpretive images and symbols that stir the imagination.<br />I highly recommend this deck for novices and for those who have used the tarot for years. It is a stunning piece of work and it will be hard for anyone to top both the quality of the deck and its packaging. Excellent work!
B000068TPN|5.0|this movie has everything a war movie need's a good plot with a lot of action. it must be statisfying action that is very real. Now what make's me mad about the review's it is said on some but not enough. Barry Peppper was the real star of this, half this movie is about him. i'm not putting down mel gibson but the best performance of this movie was Barry Pepper's who is alway's the underdog that show steals like he did in Saving Private Ryan.
0385504209|2.0|This was by far the worst of Brown's books.  Angels &amp; Demons is a much better story.  Although I found the concept interesting, there was very little suspense in the book, and a disappointing ending.  If you have the &quot;FACTS&quot;, spit them out.  What I've found interesting is the way Brown in all of his previous books let the reader almost believe the &quot;conspiracy&quot; then revealed it for what it was, a BIG HOAX!  However in DaVinci, he changes his patented ending and leaves these cleverly disguised 1/2 truths as &quot;Facts&quot;.  Why the change in approach? Does he really want us to believe the ultimate conspiracy?  I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the other books, but, his agenda came through on this one and I'm extremely disturbed.  I hope that most people understand that a lot (maybe most) of the &quot;FACTS&quot; are not accurate (see [...] Next time, Mr. Brown,  please get your facts straight; your credibility is now being questioned.  Maybe now I need to explore how much was accurate in Angels &amp; Demons.  I also found interesting the review below about the inaccurate descriptions of Paris.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|\\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\" is the quintessential teenager in love, feel good movie of the 1940s and despite the fact that the film is sixty years old, it sparkles like vintage champagne from the canons of MGM's illustrious film heritage. Judy Garland is Esther Smith, a girl pining for the affections of the boy next door (Tom Drake) while lamenting the fact that her father (Leon Ames) is about to move the family to New York.  And all this before young Esther and her siblings have a chance to see the World's Fair. What's the critical desperation of youth to do? Well, if you're Judy Garland you warble one effervescent tune after the next. From The Trolley Song to Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, truly, this movie is a veritable potpourri of golden memories. Margaret O'Brien and Lucille Bremer costar as Garland's sisters. Mary Astor and Harry Davenport are ideally cast as mother and grandfather respectively. One of the great joys of cinema, Marjorie Maine, surfaces as the Smith's gregarious housekeeper.<BR>THE TRANSFER: It's really no surprise that Warner's high resolution digital mastering has made \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\" look and sound as it never has before. In the mid 1990s MGM home video gave us a very smart looking laserdisc box set. This DVD improves upon the resolution of the old format and provides a smooth, rich and textured visual presentation of one of Vincente Minnelli's greatest achievements. Colors are bold, rich and fully saturated. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Fine detail can be seen in even the darkest scenes. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 (as it was on the laserdisc) and is very well represented. There is nothing to complain about in this presentation.<BR>EXTRAS: The same documentary as was previously available from MGM, narrated by Roddy McDowell and chronicling the saga of bringing this film to life plus several short subjects particularly produced for this 2-disc special edition.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: This classic is an absolute must foranyone who loves movies - period!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This film is a pure love story that will leave you crying in the end. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were excellent in this film. I recommend Moulin Rouge to everyone. A BRILLIANT FILM!!!
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an inspired, harsh and critical retake on the Great Depression and its human fall out. While other studios were producing ultra high glamour and star driven vehicles, Darryl F. Zanuck chose to turn his spotlight on the crisis of the country and came up with an all time box office winner. It stars Henry Fonda as the forgotten man of conscience who is forced to leave his homestead in search of a hopefully better life that, sadly, is not to be. Jane Darwell is brilliant as Ma Joad, the defiant, resilient and compelling matriarch who keeps the family together through these tough times. Dark was the world of the 1930s in reality, but never was it more magically brought to life than in this inspirational film of hope, courage and the dream of prosperity that must have seemed so far out of reach at the time of the film's general release.<BR>TRANSFER: Previous versions of this film have looked as though they were caught in their own dust bowl. This DVD managed to recapture much of the lost visual style absent in earlier versions. Greg Tolland's evocative camera work is magnificently captured. Black levels are deep. The gray scale, for the most part is well balanced and captures the stark harshness of the original presentation. There are a host of age related artifacts present throughout but these have at least been tempered and do not terribly distract. There is some shimmering of fine details and more than a hint of pixelization in this transfer. Nevertheless, the image quality is an improvement over previous incarnations. Somehow it almost seems to add to the vintage of subject matter of this film. The audio is remixed to 5.1 but really - this is a mono film with very little spread or reason for it across your other channels.    <BR>EXTRAS: A biography on Darryl F. Zanuck, audio commentaries, restoration comparison and theatrical trailer. One should expect no less! <BR>BOTTOM LINE: \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an enduring tale of enduring souls caughtin the uncertainty of their times. But there's no uncertainty about my recommendation of this disc. An absolute must!
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is without question, Radiohead's best album to date. It is near perfect, with every song flowing together to create a giant wave of sound. This is one of few albums that be be listened to from the beginning to end with no skipping through to find favorites, because all of the songs are good, but most are great. These best tracks include &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Let Down&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, and &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot;. These four alone would be enough to call it a good album. I compare it Oasis'1995 release &quot;(What's the Story?)Morning Glory&quot; because they are similiar in that every song on the record is great and unforgetable.
B000003TA4|5.0|This would have to be my favorite rock album because everything was produced so well. The guitar instrumentals were great, the drum patterns were great, and so was Kurt Cobain's vocals. I like every song on this CD Kurt just put a lot of emotion in his music and I have to respect that. I miss Kurt Cobain, there are too many sucky bands out there.
B00005JMSE|3.0|Hellboy is cliche after cliche, but with one heck of a sweet performance by Ron Perlman as Hellboy himself.  And there's the rub.  This really should have been a movie about Hellboy and his travails, sinking deep into his character--perhaps even as a narrator.  Instead, we get a pastiche of well-worn fan-boy story standards--Nazis, Lovecraftian \\"elder gods,\\" Nostrodamus, etc.--tied together by unnecessary clutter.  And then, every so often, Perlman drops in with an endearing scene, and some great lines.<br />There's no great villain here.  The special effects are so-so (you can even see Perlman battling the wires on one jump), and the directing is workmanlike and not much more.  Too bad.
0345457684|4.0|Morgan gets off to an auspicious start with &quot;Altered Carbon.&quot;  This novel was entertaining enough that I finished it in one cross-country airplane trip.  That's no small feat; I'd rather stare at the back of the seat in front of me than finish some of the books I've brough on airplane trips.<br />If you like cyberpunk, you will probably like this.  To the extent that it has problems, it perhaps follows the conventions of the genre a bit too closely.  Further, there are one or two too many characters, and the crime investigated by the main character is a bit too convoluted.  In fairness, I don't care for mysteries, which typically involve the same kind of over-thought and complicated crimes and investigations; if you like mystery novels and SF, you would likely give this five stars and enjoy it quite a bit.
6305907145|2.0|If not based on a Jane Austen novel I may have liked this movie better. In a world of course, stupidity based humor and overt sexuality I seek Jane Austen as my island away from it all. Current movies based on her work such as \\"Emma\\" with Gwyneth Paltrow, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Colin Firth capture the essence and beauty of her work. This version of \\"Mansfield Park\\" had the potential. A beautiful cast, the costumes, the English countryside but they lost the spirit of Ms. Austen. Miss Crawford's attentions towards Miss Price are at times uncomfortably sensual. There are illustrated scenes of sex and also brief nudity. Not at all what I expected from a movie based on the works of my beloved Ms. Austen.
B000002H6C|5.0|THIS IS IT. THE BEST METALLICA ALBUM TO HAVE EVER BEEN RELEASED. DEDICATED TO THE LATE CLIFF BURTON, THIS HEAVY METAL CLASSIC IS OVER AN HOUR OF NONSTOP, 100% PURE HEAVY METAL. THIS IS METALLICA AT THEIR BEST. ''ONE'' [THE SONG THAT METALLICA DID THEIR 1ST EVER MUSIC VIDEO FOR] IS THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM. BUT, THERE ARE OTHER SONGS THAT'RE JUST TOO GOOD TO MISS; ''THE SHORTEST STRAW'', ''TO LIVE IS TO DIE'', ''THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY'', AND ''DYERS EVE''. THIS ALBUM IS WAY TOO HOT TO MISS. I'D SAY THIS IS IN CONTENTION FOR THE BEST METAL ALBUM EVER RELEASED. A DEFINITE GEM.
B00005JN0A|5.0|I've seen some past reviews of people that really hated this movie.  (...)<br />Dude, calm down.  Our culture is different than yours, and of course our humor is going to be different by poking fun at the sterotypes of other cultures.  You may not find it funny, but I guarantee that there are some movies that may be made that you would think are hilarious, whereas we would think as absolute and complete crap.  And enough with the \\"stupid Americans\\" because us \\"stupid Americans\\" think that Europeans are oftentimes just as bad if not worse in some respects.<br />With that out of the way...do not see this movie if you are easily offended.  Because if you are easily offended, you WILL get offended.  But, calm down, because it's supposed to be a societal satire of sorts.  I found this movie extremely hilarious, and I laughed at a lot of the jokes, despite that they were making fun of me (I'm Catholic and German thank you very much.)  I highly suggest this movie if you liked Old School or Road Trip.
B000002H33|5.0|AROUND THIS TIME, METALLICA SEEMED AS IF THEY JUST COULDN'T MAKE A BAD ALBUM! THIS IS YET ANOTHER UNFORGETTABLE HEAVY METAL MASTERPIECE. MUST-HEAR SONGS ON THIS ALBUM INCLUDE ''DISPOSABLE HEROES'', ''THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE'', THE TITLE TRACK, AND ''ORION''. 2ND ONLY TO ''...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL'', THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST METALLICA ALBUMS EVER RELEASED. BUY THIS ONE NOW! THIS WOULD BE THE LAST METALLICA ALBUM THAT WOULD FEATURE CLIFF BURTON AS THE BASS PLAYER. CLIFF DIED WHILE ON TOUR WITH METALLICA.
B00005UW7G|5.0|This cast and production are a once in a century (if that) event; there is no better performance available, period.  Raimondi is at the height of his career and the finest Don Juan in anyone's memory, Kanawa is brutally on target as Elvira, Edda Moser has only one better Donna Anna performance (but there is no better person to play her), van Dam is stupendously played (almost too well)... one can go on and on.  Losey, and everyone else was involved in this project really know their performance history of Don Giovanni and the Don Juan legacy in general.  This literary myth has a life of its own over the past few hundred years and this project created huge ripples throughout the European opera community.  Casts like this almost never see the transfer to video.  The actual production conditions were authentically grueling and difficult, much like a live stage performance.<br />This movie suffers from technical flaws in the filming, sound production, DVD transfer, etc.  There is even an encoding mistake in the DVD that overlaps for about 5 seconds of audio at one point, though overall the audio and video are cleaned up from the previous VHS/PAL releases.<br />What I can say without hesitation is that it is akin to viewing Michelangelo's David, through a broken and slightly hazy window.  Once you forget about the lens, you will never see anything to compare to what you are seeing.  And the clarity of the window does not in any way reflect on the actual miracle.
B000002HMH|2.0|AFTER RELEASING 5 OF THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL ALBUMS EVER RECORDED, METALLICA RETURNED WITH THIS MEDIOCRE ALBUM. THE ALBUM ACTUALLY STARTS OUT OK. BUT AFTER ''THE HERO OF THE DAY'', THE ALBUM JUST DESCENDS INTO RAMPANT BOREDOM. AND QUITE FRANKLY, IT ALMOST NEVER RECOVERS. THE BEST SONG IS EASILY ''UNTIL IT SLEEPS''. WHAT A LETDOWN FOR ALL THE METALLICA FANS. CMON GUYS, Y'ALL CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!
0312995423|1.0|This book, which I picked up at an airport,after reading the DaVinci codes, is a poorly disguised attempt to sell the public an inferior product on the coattails of a more succesful one. The plot is so thin it's transparent with unlikely scenarios and poorly defined characters. Mr. Brown knowledge of Spain, Catholic ritual, Code encryption and computers is only outstanding because of his ignorance. I believe the book deserves a minus star as a very poor attempt at literature. I thought the Da Vince Codes were just fair (despite its best seller status) and I doubt I will ever read Dan Brown's work again.
B000002H97|5.0|UP BY THE TIME THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED, METALLICA WAS SERIOUSLY BEGINNING TO BECOME A VERY WELL-KNOWN BAND. WHEN THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED, METALLICA [RIGHTFULLY SO] BECAME A MAINSTREAM PHONOMENON. THE SONGS HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT SHORTER, BUT THIS WAS STILL ANOTHER HEAVY METAL CLASSIC. SONGS TO CHECK OUT ARE ''ENTER SANDMAN'', ''MY FRIEND OF MISERY'', ''DON'T TREAD ON ME'', ''THE UNFORGIVEN'', AND THE POWERFUL ''NOTHING ELSE MATTERS''. FANS OF METALLICA ACCUSED THE BAND OF GOING SOFT WHEN THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED. BUT, THEY DIDN'T GET SOFT, THEY JUST SIMPLY TOOK THEIR MUSIC TO A FEW NEW LEVELS. AFTER THIS ALBUM, METALLICA WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|i have a lack of words to describe Avenged Sevenfold, i usually don't give bands like this a chance, but i gave this cd a chance and it is a very very good cd. They have a metal feel to them, but not as heavy as some, but wonderful lyrics more than make up for it. The stand out track on this cd is &quot;unholy confessions&quot; which is a masterpiece. I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants a solid rock album with alot of metal mixed in with beatiful lyrics and growls. Forget anyone who compares A7X to linkin park they are way ahead of linkin park.
B000002H2H|5.0|THE 2ND ALBUM FROM METALLICA IS ANOTHER HEAVY METAL MASTERPIECE. AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLY EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING THAN ''KILL EM ALL''! AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CD ARE ''TRAPPED UNDER ICE'', ''THE CALL OF KTULU'', ''FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE'' AND ''FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS''. BETWEEN THE MONSTROUS GUITAR RIFFS AMD JAMES HETFIELD'S INTENSE VOCALS, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT! FOR METALHADS, THIS IS NONSTOP EXCITEMENT. OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN CHECK THIS OUT.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The third instalment of the Wachowski brothers' cyberpunk trilogy pretty much delivers as much as fans of the series could expect from a final chapter. Picking up directly from the end of Matrix Reloaded, Revolutions wastes no time drawing you compellingly back into the dystopic netherworld of Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the omnescient Agent Smith. Fans of the original who were turned off by the 2nd instalment may definitely find more to savor here - Revolutions shamelessly rips off enough popular sequences from the original Matrix to recover some ground amongst the action set left cold by the deliberate pacing and mythologising of pt 2. And - although the Wachowskis deserved greater recognition of their distinctly un-Hollywood attempt to do something different with their 2nd instalment - it has to be said the return to familiar action conventions is rather  more satisfying. There's still enough mock-philosophical mumbo jumbo to keep the anorak set engaged  - but Matrix Revolutions is more sure-footed than its immediate predecessor about what it fundamentally best is - a crowd-pleasing bubblegum action blockbuster. So put your brain on hold; suspend your disbelief and throw away any expectation of a logical conclusion. That done, strap yourself in and get ready for one hell of a ride!
B000000IUH|5.0|When you get this CD, turn off the lights, close your eyes and open up your imagination.  Prepare for a journey into a world of harmony and universal beauty, where there are no time or space constraints.  With this music, you don't need LSD to float freely into the ether...
B00006JDS4|3.0|Trashy, violent exploitation thriller that continues to enjoy cult support as an underground cause celebre following its intermittent bannings - and tag as a \\"video nasty\\" - in the 1980s. Camille Keaton - reputedly a descendent of the late, great Buster (who, if so, would undoubtedly be spinning in his grave!) - plays a beautiful out-of-town novelist (...). Still traumatised by her ordeal, she proceeds to exact brutal vengeance on her attackers, through a crowd-pleasing (or revolting, depending on the limits of your tolerance) succession of violence(...). One of the first dubious classics for the home video generation. Forget the disingenuous quasi-feminist justifications of the film's following - this plays like the [illegitimate] child of Wes Craven's Last House on the Left and Abel Ferrara's Ms 45. If you're going to like it, at least like it for what it is: a no-holds barred piece of violent exploitation that earns its second star only due to is barrier-breaking filmographic place in horror exploitation cinema. Also known as Day of the Woman.
6304711905|5.0|There's a lot to be said for this version of the 'Gunfight at the OK Corral.' Like many westerns, it's a story of honor, loyalty, and an inescapable journey wrestling with one's character.<br />In many ways, it bears striking similarity with Alan Ladd's portrayal of Shane many, many years ago. Both Shane and Wyatt Earp have a violent past, to some extent supported by a sense of honor, yet violent nonetheless. Both men imagine they can escape that past and live a life of peace and normalcy. Both men fail. Kevin Costner faces a similar conflict in &quot;Open Range,&quot; and all men have a similar narrator, so to speak, Dana Delaney in &quot;Tombstone&quot; being the most recent.<br />Powerful roles are fulfilled by Sam Elliott as brother Virgil, but perhaps the most telling observation is made by the youngish Bill Paxton playing the role of brother Morgan, who tells Wyatt when he won't go along with him and Virgil to again strap on the six-shooters, &quot;you gotta' back your brother's play.&quot;<br />If I found pleasure in the movie it was superlative qualities of all of the actors, and the grittiness of the scenery. On occasion it almost left you with a feeling of dust in your mouth. If there was a let down it was the eventual union with Dana Delaney which, when acted out, almost seemed inconsequential in light of the ensuing carnage following the 'OK Corral' incident. I found equally unsatisfied with the ending of &quot;Open Range,&quot; where again 'true love' did not appear to be much of an antidote for the extraordinary emotional and physical trauma earlier experienced. And a lot of blood. To me, it seemed much more logical when a weary Alan Ladd rode away at the ending of the much earlier &quot;Shane.&quot;<br />Having said that, &quot;Tombstone&quot; carries the day with brilliant acting on all levels, especially Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer, who carry the supporting roles they are assigned as the ailing Doc Holliday and Virgil with a high level of skill. 5 stars.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|The first Matrix film was an incredible phenomenon, and became an instant classic with it's intricate premise, colorful characters, mind-blowing martial-arts action and never-before-seen special effects which have become the mother of all imitation.<br />The follow-up, The Matrix: Reloaded, was released 4 years after the original film. By this point, the movie had been re-hashed, imitated, and joked about. Bullet time, which was introduced in the original film, was ripped off by other films, to where when this sequel lept off the screen, it almost seemed as it was imitating it's own self. Reloaded also spent it's running time almost completely mired in its own confusion. I felt this overwhelming need by the Wachowski brothers to try to explain their marvelous creation to the waiting public. The freeway scene was the pinnicle of the movie, but the ending was a train wreck. Call me stupid, but to me, it's no fun to be confused. I disliked walking out of the theater feeling like I was involuntarily subjected to a 10 minute crash course in the laws of physics.<br />Now that our brains hurt from the second film, now we can relax and enjoy the spectacle of The Matrix: Revolutions, knowing that all the information we could ever want again in our lives just took place in the second film. Revolutions kicked up the action a few notches, and left our brains alone for the most part.<br />The Matrix movies had the capability to become one of the greatest trilogies of all time, next to the original Star Wars trilogy and The Lord Of The Rings series.<br />At the end of Return of the Jedi in the Star Wars trilogy, good conquered evil, and the hero saved the day.<br />At the end of The Return Of The King in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, we are given the most definitive finale in cinema history.<br />In the Matrix: Revolutions, that little window of opportunity to make more cash down the road for the series was propped open. As was proven by the final dollar take at the gate for both Reloaded and Revolutions, it would have been better to nail the window shut, never to be opened again.r both Reloaded and Revolutions, it would have been better to nail the window shut, never to be opened again.
B000022TSW|5.0|The movie is about four boys who were not allowed to say an F-word, and the teachers gave them all a punishment. The reason why they were saying that F-word is because they were watching a Terrance &amp; Phillip movie.

0385510438|4.0|John Grisham's novel The Last Juror did an excellent job of keeping the reader enthralled.  While many believe that the end of this novel is not as entertaining as those of his other novels, I find Grisham's fusion of all the sub-plots into one coherent ending breathtaking.  The whole plot of a family having so much power over a community never ceases to remind me of the lesson on political machines in U.S. history.  We all enjoy seeing the bad guy fall and Grisham shows that in a quaint fashion.<br />  I also enjoyed the characters of this novel.  Grisham portrays the main character, Willie Traynor, as a nonchalant college-grad who is simply looking for a job.  As the novel progresses, Traynor transorms into an industrious newspaper editor who is anxious to portray evils in the world.  It is my sincere opinion that everyone can relate to Traynor in some sort of fashion.  Whether it be his youthful attitude in the beginning, or his undying passion to root out the evils in society, or his simple attraction to one of his peers of the opposite sex, we all can find a niche in his character.<br />  Truly, Grisham does an excellent job as depicts some unique aspects of American life and relates them to the legal system.  What you find in this novel is more than suspense or entertainment, you will find perspective.  You will find your eyes open to another world around you.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I loved the first flim.  It was origenal, fast-paced, and just plain cool.  I saw &quot;Relaoded&quot; a few days after it's thactrical release.  I was confused, really confused.  I was compleatly lost throughout the entire movie.  <BR>The fight sceans are better then they were in the first movie.  The highway sceen is the best action sequence in the history of cinama. <BR> November came around, and I hoped &quot;Revolutions&quot; would clear things up.  It did'nt.  Someone please explain this weird ass trilagy to me.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Blowup, made in 1966, was a wonderful movie experience when I saw it then.  And now seeing it in a wonderfully restored verison on DVD made me understand why I enjoyed it so much.  This is due mainly to the very insightful commentary by Peter Brunette.  Peter, I believe, as set a new standard for very prepared and thoughtful commentaries for DVDs.  He describes each scene, explains the importance of it, and gives how other critics have looked at it.<br />Most importantly, Prof. Brunette has a keen understanding of the political atmosphere of the period.  He allows the viewer to gain a valuable sense of what Antonioni was trying to accomplish with this film and gives us an understanding of the late 1960's.
B00009M6VJ|4.0|A good thiller with great twists and turns in all the right places.  Not only is this a good, thilling movie, it is an insughtfull look at the death penalty and &quot;Texas justice&quot;.  The flim has very good charecters.  The redneck lawyer, the young news inturn, and the student with an ax to grind.  The most powerfull and and intreging scenes are the ones in which Kate Wislet (also gives an excellent performance) interviews Gale from behind glass.  <BR>  Gale is a Harvard phiosopher who is stongly opposed to the death penalty.  His world is turned upside down when he is put on death row.  it is emotionally reaching to watch his family life suffer (suburd filmmaking).  Wislet plays a journalist with a shady past.  She and her young intern must race the clock to save Gale.  Intense, sometimes unwatchable parts.  Age 15 and up.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|The movie starts out pretty good and I thought I was in for original suspense thriller, I mean things certainly started out creepy enough.  But as the film went along it quickly turned into a cliche filled &quot;I'm trapped in a mental institution but I'm really sane but no one believes me cause I'm in a mental institution&quot; type movie.  There were some very noticable plot holes and certain things just make no sense at all.  Like why does this spirit &quot;ask&quot; Halle Berry for help then beats the crap out of her?  Why does the spirit unlock the door for her to get out of her cell, then scare her nearly getting her caught by the guards?  It just seems like they needed to throw in scenes of the ghost girl lunging at the screen and decided to just put it in for a jump even if it makes no sense at all.  Other things that were just thrown in to make the story move forward was the guard actually handing Halle the keys to his car and not ratting her out to the others that were looking for her, you can practially hear the writers wondering how they could get Halle to the house thus finding out about the cabin et al.  But just made no sense.  Overall, this movie is ok, some good creepy scenes but far from intelligent.
0061015725|3.0|In &quot;Prey&quot; Michael Crichton treats us to another book cooked up from his trademark recipe for a thriller -- an array of scientific and technical facts stacked up to dizzying heights and arranged in always surprising combinations, sympathetic characters trying to save their own necks, and the world, from man-made catastrophe, and lots of running and screaming.<br />In &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Crichton asked what happens when genetic engineers, paleontologists, and theme park designers get together to talk about money making ventures.  Here, the villainous technologies are genetic engieering, computer science, and nanotechnology.  He brings all these elements together in &quot;Prey&quot; to give us a great piece of mind candy.  Though not great literature, and not even &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot; is still entertaining page turner.<br />There are a couple of problems with the book.  First of all, it's just not as thrilling to read a story about someone being chased across a parking lot by a big gray cloud of nanoparticles as it is to read about someone running from a T. Rex through a jungle.<br />The science is also a problem.  Crichton's science is ultimately wrong in most of his books, but his rapid-fire use of a huge number of facts can often make a believer out of almost anyone.  The illusion wears a little thin in &quot;Prey&quot;, though.  &quot;How did the nanoparticles learn to do that?&quot;  &quot;Well, they're controlled by a neural net, of course.&quot;  &quot;Oh yeah.  Well, how could they learn so quickly?&quot;  &quot;They're programmed to evolve much faster than natural organisms.&quot;  &quot;Oh yeah.&quot;  Of course, I'm exaggerating, but the level of scientific discourse is far too handwaving to satisfy &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; fans.<br />So, it's an OK read, and it would (will?) make another great movie.  Buy it if you just have to have everything that Crichton writes.  Buy it if you just want something to pass the time.But don't buy it if you're looking another ground breaker like &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;
B00005JN1L|3.0|This movie had an extremely overdone plot with underdone acting. Johnny Depp was the only convincing actor, trading in (or so I thought) his insane characters and portraying a depressed, bitter, normal man in the middle of a divorce. It was easy to connect with him and feel sympathetic, but I was surprised to see that towards the end, his performance was not impressive. The movie says 'the ending is the most important part of the story.' That's probably why I can't bring myself to remember the good parts. Both Stephen King and Johnny Depp have a history of making books/movies with great starts and unsupported/down right awful finishes, not to mention that this ending has been done numerous times. Still, if you can bring yourself to ignore the end- I would suggest watching this movie for the rest.
B0000024ZC|1.0|-<br />I don't know.  I love GG, and many of their albums are perfect.<br />But this one, I can't wrap my head around it.<br />It's too simple, and a big step down from AQUIRING THE TASTE.<br />Alot of people love it, so maybe it's me.<br />But, IMHO there's only one good song here.  Not enough to make me spend my hard-earned money.<br />-
B00009L1TA|1.0|Basic was panned by its critics and rightly so. It is opportunity squandered on a nonsensical ending. Basically the story is not so basic. In fact it is the opposite of basic and makes no sense at all. The story is about a group of trainee army recruits who must survive a training exercise only their drill instructor is killed during the task and then the recruits start killing each other and the premise is a sort of \\"who dun'it\\" with two survivors left to tell the tale and an ex-ranger brought in to interrogate the suspects. The first half of the film is great and above average for a murder mystery. There is a good story there that will keep you tuned in. The characters are farcical and the dialogue really macho vs one-liners, but the over the top treatment works for awhile. However the man who brought us Die Hard and Predator, John McTeirnan, has really gone down the tubes much like John Carpenter and William Friedkin. The ending stinks so bad that the movie is lost into 1 star purgatory. Basically it has this double twist ending and then a final third twist and at that point you just want to get your money back. It really is that stupid. Do not say you have not been warned. Basic ends in a way that casts shame on all involved.<br />What a waste.
B000006YYM|5.0|-<br />Side one (the first four songs - I guess this dates me as an old vinyl fogey!) is perfect.  The band finally brought their live sonic sensibilities to the studio, and the material kicks butt!<br />There is an urban myth that you can't tap your feet to sophisticated music (re: Prog).  This album debunks that completely.<br />The band keeps all the threads open and engaging - they don't over-play an interesting part like many \\"prog\\" bands.  They give you just enough to want more, then they veer off down another equally interesting path.<br />They never drive themselves down a dead-end street on this album.  They've hit their stride and are walking on the cloud peaks!<br />One of my Desert Island Discs!<br />-
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a brilliant series killed off in its prime by stupid network execs who totally messed it around and then cancelled it after only 11 episodes. However, the HUGE number of fans and the cool fansites they have set up is testiment to how great this series was and its ability to entrance audiences and create a cult following in such a short space of time.<br />It's a clever premise - an assortment of rebels, lost souls and wanderers travelling the frontiers of space on the run from the law and sometimes their pasts. It has been beautifully executed by the brilliant Joss Whedon (of Buffy and Angel fame) and an endearing and talented cast. Often funny, action-packed, and sometimes serious it is truly great television (which we all know is rare) and worth owning on DVD. I highly recommend this series
B000002R0R|5.0|-<br />GG readily admits that this album is a result of the pressure their label was putting on them to go more &quot;commercial&quot;.  One gets the sense that they resisted this as best they could.  But they eventually relented.<br />Yet, on CIVILIAN they show they didn't abandon their eccentric roots completely.  They just polished them up a bit; this is the album you get when the experimental and provocative GG polishes their material to a commercial sheen.<br />The last 4 songs are particularly excellent (side two of the vinyl!).  This is one of my all-time top-ten favorite album sides (right up there with side two of ABBEY ROAD).<br />It's perfect, and it's on the strength of this four-song set that I give this 5 stars.<br />-
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have waited a while in reviewing this album.  As a big fan of Madonna, I like to take my time and listen to the songs.  This album was not received well by \\"critics\\" and the general public for a few reasons - the political climate of our country, questionable marketing of singles, and a very poor first radio single.  \\"American Life\\" is one of the weaker songs on the album and is only redeemed in remixes.   It would have been interesting to see if the lead single was \\"Love Profusion\\" or \\"Nothing Fails\\", both strong songs that can stand alone on the radio.  I do appreciate the completeness of the album - you very much get a feeling that she is telling a story through each song. I belive that just like her Erotica album, American Life will be unappreciated by many people, but will stand the test of time.  An upcoming remix album should be very promising.
B000002R9X|5.0|-<br />This is the &quot;gateway&quot; album that has drawn most GG fans into the fold.  It doesn't take alot of mental gymnastics to follow what they're doing, and some of the melodies are absolutely gorgeous!<br />The penultimate GG album, this is GG's FRAGILE, GG's RUNES (Zeppelin's 4th), GG's COURT AND SPARK (Joni Mitchell).  You getting the drift?<br />So, if you've NEVER heard the band, then THIS IS THE FIRST ALBUM YOU SHOULD BUY!<br />BUT!!............<br />You need to know that some of the master tapes they used to make this CD are different mixes than the master tapes they used for the Vinyl LP!  It's particularly noticable on the second song, &quot;On Reflection&quot;.<br />For instance, the first melodic phrase is repeated twice.  On the album the drum accompaniment only occurs on the SECOND melodic line, but on the CD is occurs on both the first AND second melodic line!  (It's actually the same percussion lick cut and pasted.)<br />This distracted me when I first got the CD.  But, it's a small complaint.<br />If you're a first-time GG listener, you'll be asking yourself, &quot;WoW!... who ARE these guys!&quot;<br />And you'll be hooked!<br />-
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This girl just comes out with the best songs. Every song on here makes me want to hit the repeat button and listen to this all day and all night long. I'm not infatuated with Alicia to the point where it blinds me to see her talent. She has an amazing voice and great music. You wouldn't recognize that Timbaland produced &quot;Heartburn&quot; but that's beside the point. Every track seemlessly flows from one another and the fact that she left the part where she talks on the phone to Mos Def in &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; is nothing but genius. Many would have taken that out. Keeping the piano in the album is a major plus. I'm glad she didn't abandon the part of her that makes her unique. &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; has so much emotion throughout the song it makes you feel her pain. The video accents the song well. Not to mention she is a beautiful woman, the way she half braids her hair is so creative. She makes it look good. I hope her next single is &quot;Wake Up&quot; or &quot;Karma&quot;, but any song would make me happy and you as well. Keep on keepin' on Alicia!
B000002504|4.0|-<br />Many GG fans call this the band's best album.  And I understand why they feel that way.<br />Yet, for me, something is missing here.<br />I love the songs - don't get me wrong!  The songwriting here is VERY strong, some of the most adventurous material the band ever came up with!<br />Yet, the production seems a bit thin and weedy.<br />I've listened to the live &quot;Excerpts From Octapus&quot; for so long, I think my problem with O comes from the power and perfection of the stage performances.  This material is SO GOOD live, that the studio album pales a bit.<br />But, that being said, it's my only complaint.<br />-
0553573403|5.0|Martin does a great job of bring his world to life, with deep discriptive writing, and a thick history. He also presents a vast knowledge of war in the middle ages, and fullfils each aspect that you could ever want: Adventure, betrayal, action, love, and intrigue.<br />The book did a great job of keeping my attention, and answering each of my question, he left alot for imagination, and yet enough to get the story across. Definatley one of the best books I ever read
B000001FW9|5.0|-<br />I listened to this last night - the first time I'd listened to it on about 10 years (not that I don't like it, just that I'm very busy).<br />I was so stunned.  Now, I'd heard this many times before, enough that I could play the songs in my head (you kow what I mean?).  But revisiting this was a minor epiphany.<br />GG makes the statement that they want to stretch the potential of popular music while running the risk of being very unpopular.  They really didn't care who liked their music; it was important to them to experiment, and to develop their complexities.<br />This freedom comes shining through this excellent album!  So powerful, and so imtimate.<br />Give it a few listens - it WILL grow on you!<br />You'll find yourself coming back to this again and again!<br />-
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I can easily see why Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar. His performance was exceptional. However, it was not enough to save one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It was slow, plotless, and had a pointless ending. As a character study it is mildly enjoyable, but only if you can stay awake.<br />Blech!
B000053GTK|5.0|-<br />This is one of the BEST prog albums ever recorded.<br />Period.<br />And it's GG's best album, hands down (no pun intended, there...).<br />Everything works - the songwriting, the arrangements, the production values (so warm, yet so strong!), even the cover.  It's almost like this album was just waiting under the sand for the band to find, whole and perfect!<br />How sad that it isn't available anymore!  If you can find it, buy it, even if you have to buy the vinyl (the vinyl has a way cooler cover than the CD anyway!).<br />-
B00005JMEW|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this film that countless others haven't already. I am a big Tarantino fan, and I still went into this film not knowing what to expect. I was blown away. I can't even put my finger on why, but I thought it was simply amazing. <br />I will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection.<br />But something tells me maybe we should hold off on this edition. In the past, Tarantino has revisited some his movies with some of the more impressive DVD sets ever. The extra features on Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction helped to improve my appreciation of two already outstanding films.<br />I am guessing that in the wake of releasing Kill Bill vol. 2 in the theaters, Miramax is looking to make some extra cash by selling Vols. 1 and 2 separately. But I would imagine they will also sell a DVD edition combining volume 1 and 2 into one movie, and that's the one I am waiting for.<br />All in all, this is a fantastic movie that belongs in any movie lover's DVD collection, and if you can't wait to buy this one I can certainly understand that. But as for me, I am going to hope that my patience pays off and that we are given the option of buying Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one epic film.
B000002R0P|5.0|-<br />I didn't know this album existed until 15 years after it was released!  One of my co-workers bought it for me, and I was ecstatic!  A new GG album to relish!  WOW!<br />This is a great GG album.  It follows FREE HAND, and it's almost like the band is saying, &quot;Yeah, the label is trying to get us to go more commercial, but to heck with them!&quot;<br />So, they back off a bit from the accessibility of FREE HAND and make this VERY adventurous disc!<br />And they seem to be having a blast!<br />GG has always done great vocal arrangements, but the song &quot;Design&quot; takes this talent to new heights.  It will take quite a few listens to appreciate it, but it's an amazing song - it hearkens back to AQUIRING THE TASTE, as though the band is thumbing its nose at their label by going back to their roots!<br />It works.<br />This is one of those gems that you will cherish.<br />-
B00018D44U|5.0|After the big impact of her CD &quot;Come away with me&quot; that won 8 Grammys and had been certified Platinum x8 and it's still on the Top 50 on the Hot 200 from Billboard after 2 years of its release.<BR>Norah Jones comes back with this delightful CD with the same style of the first but well I might add that it contains a smooth touch of Country style but sounds very good. The lyrics are fantastic along with the instruments and Norah's voice that really makes you relax and feel pleased. Personally I listen to  her music at home while I'm reading or sending mails and sometimes when I'm driving and it really relaxes me.<BR>You can also find a duet with Dolly Parton on this production.<BR>If you like this production, I'm more than sure that you'll love &quot;Come away with me&quot; (I prefer that one).
B00018D44U|1.0|I was gonna use the kids review form (under 13) after I heard a couple tracks on this ... In the interest of full disclosure, I only found 2-3 songs on the first one interesting ..... But come on people!  Serious question why buy a music CD with a \\"singer\\"?  This isn't singing.  The album is well produced, but other than that what's the point?  Buy a 'book on CD' and listen to the voice that's on it, whoever it is ... there won't be much different of an overall effect. If you want to hear a woman sing and you actually feel something (other than sleepiness), pick up Lita Ford's Best Of and spin \\"Close My Eyes Forever\\", with Ozzy, and the gorgeous song \\"Lisa\\" (which actually came out in the '90s).   You think 'Surely I jest'?  Listen to it. I dig some of Alanis Morissette's stuff too, even though she's a mom now and her music has changed ~ she has at least a glimmer of emotion in her voice .....   But this record ... it's amazing in today's music world how some people can talk softly into a microphone, over music, and it get's called singing.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I liked the special edition movies, but the idea that they are now the only version of the movies irritates me. <br />It is much like the \\"new\\" coke that came out. suddenly the one we liked, grew up with, took part ownership of and grafted into our conciousness cannot be found. <br />a \\"special edition\\" and a \\"classic edition\\" HAS to be the way to go. if you look at the official website, they dont even make the distinction. the orginal does not exist, this is episode 4,5,and 6.<br />I fully expect that if the \\"classic\\" and \\"special\\" editions were available, the classic would outsell the special handily. But more importantly, if you are in charge of this at lucas film, i.e. named george lucas, there will be a very high number of people who will buy both(...).
0792841344|5.0|One of the hardest parts about writing a review of a film I love is conveying my feelings into written words.  Why does the music in this movie haunt me?  Why do the characters seem so real and why does the Tall Man seem so scary?  He is just a tall, older man, but he is creepy to the extreme.  I can't tell you why, but I know these things to be true.  <br />Phantasm has a wildly imaginative story; one of the most original ideas for a horror film in ANY decade.  Two brothers and their ice cream vending friend face down a tall, gaunt, creepy, mortician and his army of hooded dwarves (called &quot;Jawas&quot; by many because of their resemblance to the Star Wars critters, even though the Phantasm creatures were actually designed first).  The Morningside Funeral Home is creepy in itself (the house they used is the same one featured in Burnt Offerings). The Tall Man's arsenal also includes the infamous &quot;Spheres&quot; which fly thru the halls of the funeral home, guarding against intruders and viciously eliminating anyone who gets in the way.  What at first looks like another undead movie turns into more of a sci-fi premise when the origin of the Tall Man is partially revealed (the full origin has still only been hinted at after 4 films).  <br />The name Phantasm hints at the dream-like unreality that saturates the story, music, direction, and cinematography.  By the end you are left not knowing exactly what was real and what was a dream as the red lettering of the credits appear.<br />Phantasm's synth score adds so much to the film.  I cannot stress this enough.  Even in scenes not actively trying to scare you, the haunting music carries you along, never letting you lose the uneasiness the movie has already built up.<br />The special edition DVD is a great package with a commentary track featuring the director and 3 primary actors, PLUS Angus Scrimm (the Tall Man) is in the commentary too, even though he is not listed for some reason.  Scrimm also introduces the movie in a rather hammy chat with the audience.  Special features also include trailers and an extensive gallery of promotional materials from it's theatrical release.  I hate to mention &quot;interactive menus&quot; because I don't see them as an actual feature, but the menus on the Special Edition DVD are fantastic.  Accompanied by the great music of the film, the menus are easy to navigate and have an interesting design.  Chapters are presented inside graphics of the spheres and are animated to you can see the exact scene as it plays out.  The 4th Phantasm film, Phantasm: Oblivion, used a lot of deleted scenes from the original movie in it's time hopping sequences.  This DVD includes even more deleted material not shown in the past-scenes of the 4th movie.  They must have cut a ton of stuff from this.  Most of the scenes are character scenes and give you more reason to like the characters.  Well worth a look.<br />Amazon lists this DVD as out of print.  If you don't have it, find it any way you can.  Maybe it will be released again in a new form, but I can't see them improving on this great DVD.
B000053GTK|5.0|I remember buying the import of this many years ago.  As a young student, it was a lot of money but it was worth it.  I do not think it was ever released in the States.  This is probably their best album followed by Octopus and Freehand.  <br />The musicianship as usual is staggering.
B00003CXCT|3.0|So much talk about Lucas adding a little CGI enhancement to the original films. Get over it! Yes, the claim that a historical monument has in some ways been defaced is valid, but who cares. I have longed to own these films on DVD for years! I had almost decided to compromise on one of those pirated versions created in some 3rd world country. The quality is reputed to be very bad. I already own the movies in original VHS form. The whole point of owning these DVD's is to enjoy the special effects in these movies in digital (all be it not original LOWER quality) . <br />(...) It would have been incredibly easy to offer all 3 movies in the same set in two versions. The original uncut version and the enhanced versions could have easily been packaged together. There are many box sets out there on the market today that offer both original and enhanced version. But the reality is this is not the choice we will be given. Life isn't always fair. <br />I will choose to own these DVD's, not because they are, as one reviewer waxed poetic \\"Like the Mona Lisa\\", but because a progressive scan DVD in combination with digital surround sound on a 57 inch TV ROCKS! Even though I saw these movies in the theaters in the 70's and 80' Like a galaxy far far away it has been many years ago. Most of us probably won't notice much of what George has changed anyway.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Am I the only one sick of spending money on one edition only for the studios to release another, newer edition within a year?  I bought the collector's edition last year, thinking surely the studio would not rip me off AGAIN.  But here it is, another edition of a movie I love but that I can't justify spending MORE money on.  At least with the Lord of the Rings movies they were up front about putting out two different editions of the movies, giving us buyers a chance to decide which edition we wanted to fork money out for.  I have 4-5 movies at home that better editions now exist for, with extras I would love to see, but I can't just keep buying the same movie over and over.<br />For the record, I love this movie, it is one of my favorites, especially when I'm in the mood to be inspired.
0385504209|5.0|Dear complaining christian,<br />I, myself, am a christian-baptist; by choice. Letting you know this, I have read this book and I sooooo disagree with you. This book is awesome and just as controversial as Jesus himself. I like the book and before you go throwing it or your Bible at anyone else (being a fundie and all...), try having a COMPLETELY open mind before walking into such items as The Da Vinci Code. People, if you really want to read this book from a unbiased standpoint, clear your mind of all things faith and look at it impartially, for it is one of the greatest books ever written; next to The Giver by Lois Lowry.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I don't understand a word of Icelandic and probably never will.  Normally I don't like to listen to music when I can't understand the lyrics, but with Sigur Ros I simply don't care.  I treat the voices as instruments, like the Cocteau Twins.<br />I love listening to this album on winter nights, with the lights out and a fire going in the fireplace.  One thing to warn you about though, there are real dynamics on this album.  The music can go from soothing to bombastic in a single moment.<br />I guess this album is a bit like the Bulgarian Voices, even if you don't understand it, you can still get it.  If you don't, well, you don't.
B00005JKL8|3.0|While I enjoyed this movie, I was discouraged by several major holes, especially those which would have more clearly showed the immorality of America's agreement to stick its head in the sand and blindly obey the U.N..  Also Owen Wilson's character appears to survive more by (incredible) luck than by skill, and that's disappointing.  Nonetheless, there were enough good pieces here for me to enjoy the movie.<br />For a much better, but similar, movie also featuring Gene Hackman, I highly recommend Bat 21.  Yet another great similar movie is &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;, though the plot of that movie is much more than just good guys shot down behind enemy lines.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys surpasses her successful debut album with this well done music project.  In all aspects this album is way better than her debut.  I like to make simple reviews so  the best tracks in this album are the leading single &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; a truth that it's close to many people like I, &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; a tune so personal, so soulful, the best according to my taste, such a classic, &quot;Karma&quot; upbeat! such a great tune, &quot;If I was Your Woman/Walk ON By&quot; wow! this is one of the best cover ever done..., &quot;Heartburn&quot;, great, &quot;Diary&quot; soulful, and &quot;Samsonite Man&quot; funny and true...this is a most have for any into soul music, such a great album, has more upbeat songs, more powerful lyrics and instant classic R&amp;B songs.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a beautiful, sad but eventually satisfying story of a young girl who survives her mother and twin brother when they die in childbrith, and is born into a Maori family in remote New Zealand.  <BR>Distraught at the death of his wife, the father leaves her with the grandparents, of which the grandfather has problems bonding with her, as traditionally a boy was needed to succeed him as tribal chief.  (His son is obviously not interested as he is more interested in modern society than a traditional Maori lifestyle)<BR>The film concentrates on her trying to prove to her grandad that she is the natural successor, and the pain she goes through to get it through to him. (Though I she is simply trying to impress him to earn his love, rather than consciously trying to become Chief)<br />This film is stunning, emotional and beautiful.  All the performances are excellent, especially the young girl (who was oscar nominated) and I personally found the cultural differences fascinating.<br />I suggest putting the subtitles on before watching the film as I had some difficulty picking up the accent at times which is very strong with some characters.<BR>The DVD extras are adequate.
6305388458|5.0|This is THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. (Or possibly even longer.) There is nothing deeper in the universe, nothing. Watching it was the most moving experience of my life and has changed me forever. I wept, I suffered, I was utterly transfigured by its TRUTH and BEAUTY. It is the ONLY movie really to tell us the truth about our Lord BRIAN as it is described in THE BIBLE. Everything in it is ACCURATE and the word of GOD. May God bless Terry Jones, a saint for our times, for having led mankind out of the wilderness by making it and shown us the true SPIRITUAL PATH. People who have written negative reviews are sad bitter and unspiritual people who deserve to burn in HELL for all eternity. I will pray for them.<br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\", on the other hand, is complete bollocks. So watch this instead.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the Star Wars Trilogy as well as a fan of George Lucas. The Trilogy and American Graffiti are among my favorite films of all time. However Lucas's decision to only release the special editions of these films borders on a crime in my mind.<br />The original release of these films marked a revolution is special effects. The motion control techniques and modeling were state-of-the-art at the times these films were released. All of hard work an innovation of teams of visionary artists will now be lost to history because of the ego and short sided thinking of one ego maniac.<br />Why don't we just colorize every black and white film ever made because the directors really wanted color, but it just wasn't possible at the time? How about \\"updating\\" Gone With The Wind and making a really spectacular CG burning of Atlanta because that is what would have done if the technology had been available?<br />(...)
B000001F76|5.0|Would you expect to find a single c.d. of Elvis' greatest hits? Sinatra's greatest? The Beatles' greatest? Not unless you like eating half a sandwich. Hank rated up there with these guys as one of the top ten recording acts of all time. This c.d. set begins to do him justice. Buy it and avoid Mercury's &quot;20 Greatest.&quot; <br />This set contains a rare track found nowhere else and which requires your purchase of this set at least long enough to burn a copy of the track. The track? &quot;Weary Blues from Waitin,'&quot; just as it was released as a single in 1953, which went straight to the top of the country charts. Even the COMPLETE HANK WILLIAMS doesn't have it.
0385504209|4.0|When I read the DaVinci Code, I literally couldn't put it down.  I stayed up half the night so that I could finish reading it.  I thought it was incredibly well written, suspenseful, and intriguing.  I don't normally read much fiction, but there was such a buzz going around about this book that I decided to pick it up, and it was well worth it.<br />Dan Brown has brought in many controversial things about Christianity in this book, and I noticed it's getting blasted for those in other reviews.  Here's my deal...Dan Brown created a very interesting FICTIONAL book.  It isn't truth...it is fiction.  The catholic church has had throughout it's history a lot of power, and throughout it's history it has misused it's power and created cover-ups.  So, I think that this makes it an obvious target to create a fictional story like this one around that concept.<br />If you're looking for a quick read that's fast paced, and suspenseful, then pick up this book.  But don't read it if you can't handle seperating fact from fiction in a fictional book.
B0000844IT|5.0|This is the third movie to come from the evil dead trilogy the greatest horror movies of all time. I HIGHLY recommended you purchase this dvd great times with bruce campbell and friends so buy it, watch it, and love it.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I am of the unwavering opinion that this film has no equal either before or since it was released.  The Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, On the Waterfront, Singin' in the Rain, and The Godfathers all come in fighting for second place after LAwrence of Arabia.<br />Regarding the numerous DVD editions, I prefer the cloth-covered Columbia Tri Star release.  The image quality is excellent (if not quite the superbit), but the film's division per disc occurs at the more natural intermission point, it has subtitles in some seven languages, and it has a nice bit of extras which are interesting enough (lacking on the single disc edition as well as the superbit).
B00006L83N|4.0|I am not sure how I did not start listening to these guys sooner.  Having been a Fates Warning fan since No Exit, and a Dream Theater fan almost as long, this is right up that alley.  These guys are compositionally very tight.  Very interesting and progressive guitar play combined with an excellent sense of melodic balance with very heavy and simplified rythym offset with great drum work makes for a very compelling album.  The title track alone is enough of a reason to buy this album.  When was the last time you got 22 good minutes on a single CD?  That being said, this album does lack in some areas.  Some of the pure headbanging songs tend to be a bit simple and may not appeal to your typical prog-rock fans, unless they are also fans of Yngvie Malmsteen, but are fun in and of themselves.  The keyboards lack the intricate interplay that you will find from Dream Theater, but are very excellent as well.  That said, don't hesitate to click on this item and buy it.  If you are reading this review because you like this style of music then you will not be disappointed.  If you are new to SX as I was then this album is a great introduction.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|I liked this film. It was fun and interesting. It offers a glimpse into a world that I'd never want to be a part of, but that I find fascinating nonetheless. Macaulay Culkin, in his first real adult role, is actually quite convincing in his portrayal of club kid icon Michael Elig, and Seth Green is creepily charming as Elig's friend and mentor James St. James. The film follows Elig's journey from starry-eyed bus boy to famous party promoter to convicted murderer, while also portraying the decadent, opulent, strange world of late 80's early 90's New York club life.<br />My favorite scene in the film involves Michael Elig, Enfant terrible, invading a burger joint and turning it into an impromptu rave. The mesmerized reaction from the bored young boy behind the counter really makes clear the reason behind Elig's appeal and fame: his ability to bring outrageous fantasy into the mundane, everyday world.<br />However, this film also makes clear how Michael's same love of fantasy and escape also brings about his downfall. Irresponsible, excessive and callous, the film shows Michael spiraling out of control until he eventually murders his drug dealer/roommate Angel.<br />Part period piece, character study, and cautionary tale, \\"Party Monster\\" is a wild ride.
6305513406|5.0|This DVD contains two of my favorite episodes from the original series (TOS). &quot;Where no man has gone before&quot; explores how a human being's moral fiber decays when given the chance to 'play god'. &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; begins to demonstrate the dynamics of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy relationship and how it sparks decisions that shape the direction of the Enterprise.
B00005QXDD|5.0|What's up with my title? That's how this cd makes me feel. This cd is very far from my usual taste in music. So why did I purchase it? For the simple reason that I heard their song &quot;Wonderboy&quot; and it caught my attention. <br />Very talented and something that I keep coming back to. Why should you buy this? Just for the fact that you should! I usually like pop music, but damn this cd rocks (excuse the pun). Brilliant vocals when they do sing! I'm listening to it right now and I can feel the energy they have. That's it, Tenacious D is an energetic, lively, bouncy, fun and talented band. One of the biggest adjectives I can use to sum up this band is random. I mean, they've made a [brilliant] song which is a tribute to the best song in the world - how odd. But that's what's brilliant about them. Rock fans you must get this! <br />It's a pleasure owning this cd.
B000001DQG|4.0|After the mammoth classic that was 1973's GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, Elton John & his lyricist Bernie Taupin had to have felt a bit drained creatively after having put their whole talents into that album. In today's music industry, an artist would be allowed to lay low afterwards to regain the energy. But with Elton's two-albums-a-year contract back in the mid-1970s, a follow-up was needed, even if the duo had little to offer this time around. Because of these conditions, 1974's CARIBOU is often given a cold shoulder in Elton's long career. True, it's not the all-out bomb it's often thought to be, but it certainly is no blockbuster either.<br /><br />CARIBOU had been written & recorded in the small space of about a month in order to be released ahead of a large world tour, and the album has more than a few hallmarks of it being a rushed affair. Had Elton & Bernie been given more time to record this album, chances are the songs included would either have been worked on further or discarded altogether. But with what we've got, analysis is still necessary.<br /><br />First off, the sour grapes. \\"Grimsby\\" has been long considered a joke recording that in retrospect is quite distasteful. I wouldn't go that far, but it certainly is several steps down from Elton & Bernie's best.<br /><br />\\"Solar Prestige A Gammon\\" was said to be written in response to critics' overanalyzation of the duo's music, so its meaninglessness is perhaps intentional. But while Paul McCartney managed to make a classic out of roasting his naysayers (\\"Silly Love Songs\\"), Elton & Bernie don't make their riposte go down as well.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen The Saucers\\" is about UFO sightings, which nevertheless just shows how Elton & Bernie were stretching for material to complete the album. \\"Dixie Lily\\" is somewhat of a good country workout that's good while it plays, but perhaps there's a reason why Elton never made another album like TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION. It's hard to catch lightning twice.<br /><br />While those are the only glaring embarassments, CARIBOU has more than its share of raisons d'etres, and they just barely overcome the ever-present bumps in the road. The top 5 hit \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" is one of Elton's finest rockers from a time when he still did a fair amount of it (interesting choice of Dusty Springfield for a back-up singer). \\"You're So Static\\" & \\"Stinker\\" are fun, meaningless rockers that are much more memorable than the other intentionally-shallow material on CARIBOU.<br /><br />The ballads are the songs that do a lot in making CARIBOU a much more enjoyable album than is often made out to be. \\"Pinky\\" is one slow number that is shockingly not given more attention in Elton's career. The closing \\"Ticking\\" is an ambitious epic about a serial killer that is literally an Elton solo recording with mostly just his piano. Despite being hailed as a low in his career, this song helps prove Elton & Bernie could still put their minds to it on a good day.<br /><br />But it's definitely the classic \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" that makes CARIBOU worth picking up. Definitely in the top 5 of Elton's ballads (although he had long abandoned any traditional love songs), this song deservedly peaked at #2 on the charts, and would finally see #1 when Elton re-recorded it as a live duet with fan & influence George Michael. The fact that George, Oleta Adams & Joe Cocker have all done well by this song is a hint of its timelessness.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on CARIBOU are certainly some of the best in the whole reissuing campaign of Elton's backlog. \\"Sick City\\" & \\"Cold Highway\\" were relegated to B-sides, but Elton & Bernie prove that just because they're on the other side of a 45 doesn't mean they're inessential. It's great to have these more easily available for those who didn't save their old singles.<br /><br />Elton's appearance in the movie version of The Who's TOMMY was one of its biggest highlights & his cover of their \\"Pinball Wizard\\" is just marvelous. Hispiano playing ranks up with his best, and his insertion of a snippet of \\"I Can't Explain\\" is genius. The Who were so knocked out by that, that when they covered \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" on the TWO ROOMS tribute album, they returned the favor by inserting a little of \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\".<br /><br />\\"Step Into Christmas\\" has deservedly become a modern Yuletide standard since its appearance, and once again indicates that no matter what kind of commonplace genre they tackle, Elton & Bernie will still put their own stamp on it. Not to mention, it is so infectious, even the most Scrooge-like of listeners will feel compelled to join in.<br /><br />Elton John & Bernie Taupin were indeed visibly exhausted on CARIBOU, with them perhaps recording the album simply to get it out & not pushing themselves to create something magical (probably because they had not much time to). The GREATEST HITS album that arrived late in 1974 would buy the duo some time for them to get back on the track again, but in the meantime, CARIBOU had to have worried some people who thought Elton & Bernie had lost their touch. But when disregarding the rhinestones in a collection like CARIBOU, it's much easier to discover the gems, even if some of them don't shine as much as they used to.piano playing ranks up with his best, and his insertion of a snippet of \\"I Can't Explain\\" is genius.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|I Really never saw whats so great about these movies!! And I think this and reloaded proved this to many people. Since i had seen the first two i decided i had to round out the triligoy. So i watched it the other day at a friends house who got an early copy. It wasn't a terrible movie, but It was far from good. The end of the series couldn't have been worse! I'm not going to say anything for those of you who haven't seen it. But i'm a firm believer that not many people see these movies for the plot. The special effects are quite impressive, but all in all the movie lacks massivly in the dialouge and acting department. The first Matrix was a fine movie, its wasn't great like every one says it was but like, the sequals were almost embarsing! I gave this movie 2 stars because i couldn't give it one and a half. The large scale battle sequence was the only redeming factor to this yawn fest.

B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are easily one of the funniest comedy duos in Hollywood history, and are probaly the best in Hollywood today. The movie stars the two of them in this funny comedy directed by Ben Stiller.<br />Ben Stiller is Derek Zoolander one of the top male models in the world. Derek has been brainwashed by the evil Mugatu(Will Ferrel) to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. Matilda(Taylor) a reporter for Time finds out about the plan and warns Derek. Zoolander must then team up with his formal rival Hansel(Owen Wilson) to foil there plan.<br />Ben Stiller is great in the movie. He directed, produced, and wrote this movie. He puts a lot of energy into the picture and you can tell. He takes the role so serious and it's so funny. The character is so dumb it will just keep you laughing.<br />I like Owen Wilson even better in the movie. His character Hansel is kind of crazy or as he likes to say &quot;Loco Esay.&quot; I love him in the walfoff in the movie. Nobody is as funny as Wilson when he's trying to act serious. I also like the rants he goes in the movie.<br />Will Ferrel is good in it. He's not as good as he could of been, but he's still good. It's not that big of part. If they had given him more material to work with this could have been so much funnier.<br />Zoolander is a funny movie. It comparison to the other movies they've done together I'd say I liked it the least. It's not as funny as Starsky and Hutch, The Royal Tauenbaums, or Meet the Parents. This still however is very good movie and I'm glad I own it.<br />The DVD extras on the movie are decent. There are some deleted scenes, extended scenes and commentary by Stiller. The movie trailer and other promotional spots are also on the disc. I liked the skit where the character Derek Zoolander was founded. It's one of the extras thats included. Overall i'd give the extras 4 stars especially since the extras are on the same disc as the movie.<br />Zoolander is a good one. If you want a funny movie to watch then I'd definetly get this one.
B000002J1U|5.0|The best of Zepp albums. Jimmy Page definitely can play, and he never did it better than here. Beautiful acoustic songs, including English folk and bluegrass influences which -unfortunately- would be replaced by silly macho-rock attitude and tech effects for the next albums. A pity Zepp did not explore the acoustic way deep enough.
0395389496|5.0|I have loved this book since I first heard it in second grade. That little boy reminds me of how I used to stay awake all night Christmas Eve and then sneak downstairs when I heard the first little noise. The artwork is wonderfull, I would just sit there and imagine I was part of the book. I am diffently going to get this book for my children.
B000002JSP|1.0|What can one do at this thing (I refuse to call it a music album) but laugh?<br />When not even diehard Zepp fans dare to give it five stars, you can imagine how bad this thing is. In fact, you can't imagine it if you didn't listen to it: it's worse. Much worse. If frontman Page wasn't giving the best in his previous albums, he's sorely missed here where he is more of &quot;just one of the guys&quot;. Some people know what to do with a synthesizer -poor old John Paul Jones certainly wasn't one of them. <br />WARNING: One minute of listening to Carouselambra can drive an uncontrollated need to smash your stereo to pieces. Remember, it's not the poor equipment's fault. Just eject the CD (which you can, and should, smash to pieces) and you'll be feeling like new again.
B000035P80|4.0|There's no doubt this film was an influential piece of cinema verite for subsequent rockumentaries. With little ado, it follows Bob Dylan and his small entourage (including Joan Baez) around England on an acoustic concert tour in the spring of 1965, in delicious black-and-white (mostly with hand-held cameras.) Much of the time we are in cars and hotel rooms, with occasional footage of Bob onstage performing alone with his guitar and harmonica. On a certain level we get a gritty version of the carefree fun of the Beatles' &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; - Bob and friends mostly hang around, seemingly without a care in the world, not appreciating how fleeting is this era of anyone's youth. At the same time, Dylan spends much of his time in pointless debates with journalists and others who are hanging around, keeping up a self-centered patter that I trust would embarrass an older man looking back on his cocky youth. It's argument for the sake of argument. His insouciant bravado has always been maddening; Bob shows little of his true self to the public in interviews and encounters, but then...he goes onstage, and those songs speak directly to our hearts, now as then. It's a weird contrast between the backstage kiss-off artist and the onstage genius. However, snatches of the real Dylan do slip through in this footage too. He seems wary and insecure around peers such as Donovan. Before going onstage at the Royal Albert Hall, the man who has just spent a long time telling a reporter that Time magazine is meaningless stops to carefully check himself in the mirror before going on. After the same concert, he seems genuinely upbeat and glad about the performance. In these and a few other glimpses, we see chinks in the armor of the self-conscious rebel, and behold, there is a human being beneath. No wonder the songs are so good. (The sound quality of the live performances isn't great in this film, but then it probably wasn't in real life in those days either.)
B000002JSN|1.0|Disco-funk clavinets? Mellow seaside ballads? Turkish-ish bowed electric guitars? Anything goes as far as the sitting ducks, oops, I meant the beloved fans, kept on buying their records. Zeppelin had a serious chance to be top quality rockers after Zepp III -but they screwed it by choosing macho r'n'r posing over substance. Physical Graffiti is a wreck. At least the original vinyl cover was funny -with all these little windows- but even that was lost with the CD!
0679405380|5.0|&quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside). Along with Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story. All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.<br />Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is cast in the form of a mystery novel. Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion. Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the &quot;secret,&quot; but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.<br />More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology. Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write. Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire. The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as &quot;ape-like,&quot; reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.<br />Of the three classic horror novels, &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is the most accessible. Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination. We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us. Even if we could not, we can recognize the &quot;werewolf&quot; in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public. This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative. If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it.move us ever further from the category of mere animal.<br />Of the three classic horror novels, &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is the most accessible.

B00008CLOA|4.0|I don't own a multimillion Sony rack, not even a Schmony. In fact I don't own the SACD version of this album, and have no plans to buy it. The thing is, the music is really good -and that should be the only important thing. PF does not feel the need to awe the prog rock listener with spectacular things -instead, the attention to detail, the careful arrangements (never too loaded) and the good execution reigns here. Still a great album after all these years, and way above the average prog rock rubbish which some people still adore.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have talked to people who liked this movie.  They fawn over its goodness.  I just do not get it. I think they're making it up.   The only thing \\"good\\" about the movie is that it makes you empathize with the boredom of the main characters.  The movie is so painfully boring that I kept waiting for the end that just would not seem to come.  Skip it.
B000024D4R|5.0|Not too often I agree with the average listener recommendation, but this time I gladly do: Animals is a splendid record, unfairly underrated. The thing is, how can you get a hit song out of an album where most songs are 10 minutes or longer, save for a witty acoustic ballad no station would put in the air? But Roger Waters -a smart songwriter indeed- is here at his peak, since the subject and the Animal Farm characters suit his style perfectly well. And the music is great too -solid, enjoyable PF stuff. Go buy it now. If you don't have the money, sell that Yes or Zeppelin collection -what good are they anyway?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|After reading reviews for multiple albums here and noticing how some of the best cds I've ever heard get mixed reviews, I've come to the conclusion that most of the negative reviews aren't fair.  People who hate Britney Spears and what she stands for aren't going to say anything good about her, and most of those claiming to have bought this cd and have listened to it probably are just lying; they've never listened to it.<br />I am a Britney Spears fan, so whether or not you think my review is biased is up to you to determine. <br />I love this cd.  The first time I listened to it I was captured.  There is some sort of magic that it has that keeps you entangled and wanting to listen to it more and more.  It's completely different from anything she has ever done, and while I miss the ...Baby One More Time and Oops! Britney, songs like Toxic, Brave New Girl, Outrageous, Boom Boom, Hook Up, Breathe on Me, Showdown, and Everytime make up for it.  <br />Quit comparing Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, they are completely different artists with different strengths.  I would never go to watch XTina live, she's boring.  She stands around and sings, that's the only way she can belt her notes (and yes, I did see her on her tour with Justin).  If Britney tried to actually sing with the way she dances around on stage, the music would be crap.  People watch and listen to Britney to dance, to be entertained.  People listen to Xtina because she has an amazing voice that moves you, but she isn't very entertaining.<br />And besides, I seem to remember some other artist who when she first came out got crap for not having a  voice: Madonna.  Madonna is still around, and she is a queen.  No other artist has affected the music world in a greater way.
B000002J09|3.0|Nah, I don't buy all the hype about this album. Yeah, Black Dog is a great song. Rock and Roll is, well, very noisy, straight rock and roll (and it works selling Cadillacs too!). Stariway to Heaven is a cheeeeeeeesy thang which never fails to impress the semi-deaf three-chord bunch, although doesn't make a dent on any minimally trained ear. As for the musicians, Page is a good player but in this album he began yielding to overdub temptation (that's why his live playing sounds so lame). Bonzo hits the drums as hard as he always did, which is pretty much all he ever did (I don't care if he revolves in his grave or not). Plant did all of his tricks in Zepp I already -and he repeated them to exhaustion in all of the other albums. <br />Overall, this is not a crappy album, but calling it &quot;the crowning achievement of r'n'r&quot; is a very long shot.
0425152251|4.0|Do you want to know more about the History of Philosophy, but don't feel like studying?. This might be the solution for you !!!.<br />In \\"Sophie's World\\" you will find an interesting novel, intertwined almost seamlessly with the History of Philosohy. Is that possible?. For Jostein Gaarder, yes. This former philosophy teacher, born in 1952 in Oslo (Norway), reached success with this book, which has managed to attract even those not commonly interested in Philosophy and also, somehow, to become part of the bibliography of many undergraduate philosophy courses.<br />The plot of the book is rather simple. It centers on Sophie Amundsen, a fourteen year old girl approaching her fifteen birthday, who one day begins to receive letters from someone she doesn't know. In those letters, her unknown correspondent  begins to tell her about the History of Philosophy, the subject he studies. Sophie's goes on receiving those letters throughout the novel, and they become an essential part of the plot, which is a mystery with unexpected turnarounds.<br />I would like to point out that I noticed a change in Sophie's attitude towards the world and what was happening around her, as the novel is nearer to its end. After learning in those letters about the History of Philosophy (that could also be called the History of Thought), she starts to think in a different, more analytical way. In my opinion, the reader suffers the same process that changes Sophie, and that is not a bad thing at all.<br />It is important to remark upon the fact that the letters that Sophie's correspondent sends her are written in a clear way, so that  she (a teenager) would be able  to understand them. Due to the fact that in those letters the main theme is Philosophy, the reader can not only enjoy a good novel but also have access to graspable explanations regarding the ideas of some philosophers, so far unknown or incomprehensible to him.<br />I recommend this book to anybody curious enough to want to read it. It doesn't require too much effort: you will learn without being aware of doing so. Concerning the age of the reader, I think that \\"Sophie's World\\" can be read easily by teenagers, but will also be appealing to adults who enjoy a good book.<br />On the whole, I believe this book is worth buying, reading and keeping. It is not perfect, though, because I think that the plot of the novel could have been better. However, there aren't too many perfect things in this world, and unfortunately that includes books. So my advice is: read it !!!. You are highly likely to enjoy doing that, and you will appreciate the change of perspective that \\"Sophie's World\\"  will bring to you.<br />Belen  Alcatit.

B000002J03|4.0|Which does not mean a lot coming from a guy who is NOT a big Zepp fan, and thinks they are way too overrated.<br />However, Zeppelin is Jimmy Page (let's face it, the other guys were all replaceable, no matter how much you love them) and Page is at his peak here. He's more solid than in Zepp I and doesn't fell the need to overdub himself ten times like he did after Zepp III. A good, almost great album, which promised a lot back in '69 -although the band didn't live up to expectations after.
0804102988|4.0|I have never been to England but I have been interested in European history, especially English history, for a number of years.<br />I found the book to be an interesting blend of fact and fancy. Enough history to be intelligent, enough creativity with the characters to keep you reading.
B000003S09|1.0|And I sure sympathize with him, as being trapped into this album must be one of the worst tortures one can conceive.<br />Back when this album was issued, most rockers spent a lot of time immersed into a dense smoky cloud created by various substances, so I can understand how they enjoyed it (they would have loved the noise of a passing train too). Unfortunately, as soon as you listen to this thing in a reasonably sober state, the truth is revealed: this is 100 percent pure crap. Self-indulgent, badly structured, terrible crap.<br />But if you are one of the diehard fans of this album, don't feel bad: there are a few prog rock albums even worse. But not too many.
B00000612P|5.0|It was Mick Waller that played the drums on this disc and is one of the main reasons why it's so great.
B000002I8D|4.0|How bad it should have been to sit hidden behind the drums while front man Peter Gabriel clowned around in his daisy-flowerish costumes, only Collins knows. Because this guy had -still has- more talent than all of his Genesis bandmates together, and yet it took so long for people to recognize it. Face Value is a great debut, wonderful music which is not afraid to be commercial. The way it should be.

B000002IST|2.0|Why did Banks and Rutherford insisted again with Calling all Stations, I'll never know. The band took five years since Invisible Touch to record We Can't Dance, and if this was the result, it should have been obvious there were no reasons to stay together. Not that I dislike Genesis' radio hits phase -in fact, I'd go with Duke or Abacab anytime over the old, pompous symphonic-ish rock albums. But WCD is tired, dull pop, the kind it gets worn out after a few weeks of radio exposition. A pity. But it seems that Genesis -like most bands- couldn't help the temptation to go on just a little too long.
0385504209|5.0|Plain and simple...This book is a FICTION novel my friends.  There's no need to take offense to a novel written based on false ideas.<br />As for the story, WOW!  This thing was spectacular!  I could not put it down.  It starts off a bit slow (The first 80 or so pages), but then really gets going.<br />You gotta get this thing.  Best book I have read in years!
B000002U8G|2.0|Not even close to Dark Side of the Moon, Animals or The Wall, this album shows the Dark Side of PF -packing together 23 minutes of lame sound effects with a couple chords and calling it &quot;an epic song&quot; (also known as Echoes). Same can be said of the rest of the album. Oh well, they were good musicians indeed -but anybody can have a faux pas.
B0000CC5CS|3.0|For those who don't follow the Terminator series or who have not seen the first two movies then this will be a great flick to watch.  But for those who are fans of the Terminator story and love the first two moves, this is a dissapointment.<br />First of all, let me acknowlege that this is a great movie.  It is very well done.  However, the plot is a far cry from what a Terminator movie should be.  One dissapointing factor is the special effects.  They are well done but over used.  T2 pulled special effects off right.  Using computer animation just enough to get the point across and not come off looking cheesy or fake.  In T3 it is obvious that computers were used and at several points it is completely obvious that Arnold Shcwarzenneggar is fake.  Particularly in the crane scene.  The other terminator is completely fake when she comes out of her skin and it looks really dumb.<br />Another point of disapointment is in how the Terminator finds his cloths.  Getting dressed is a staple of the series.  In T1, the termiator beats up some punks for his wardrobe.  In T2 he walks into a bar and beats up a bunch of bikers.  See the them so far?  In T3 guess what he does?  Beats up some bikers?  Slaughters some people and takes everything they have?  No.  He goes into a bar at ladies night and ruffs the clothing away from a homosexual male dancer.  How stupid is that.<br />At several points in the movie as well director Jonathan Mostow tried to add humor, but he ended up making just cheesy one liners.  Arnold is know for one liners, but they are usually not a stupid as this.<br />A disapointing factor in the plot I found was that the new Terminator was actually a terminator designed to terminate terminators.  That is so non-creative.  They would have been better off keeping them both original T100 or T100s.<br />The movie does have good points though.  You get to see more of the history of the terminators and in this way, the movie does add to the terminator story well.  Thereis a more detailed history of SkyNet and how it came to be.  You even get to see the actual takeover of SkyNet.  There are many intersting new technologies that keep up with how we run lives today, such as the way the terminator can link up to databases through the cell phone.  Although this a fresh idea, I think it makes the movie too timely.  T2 is completely timeless and it can be watched and not make you think about \\"what life was like then,\\" as T3 is sure to do 10 years from now when someone will watch it and go \\"haha, look how funny cell phones looked back then.\\"<br />T3 is a well made movie and I will give it that.  But it is a shambles of what it should have been.  It is HUGE dissipointment if you are a big fan of the first two movies.  If you can watch it without thinking back to thw other movies and becomming angry as I did, then you can enjoy it.  T3 is a complete work of HOLLYWOOD, making it a complete work of DISAPOINTMENT for the fans.
B000002J0B|2.0|And saved themselves from the overtly humiliating Physical Graffiti and its follow ups. But who can take such a decision when dollars are raining from the sky, huh?<br />Houses of the Holy is a bad album. When you need a thousand guitar overdubs to spike up some interest in &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, it's just because your base material sucks. The rest isn't much better either. John Paul Jones, a solid bassist, plays cheesy mellotron strings here -another bad sign. But what the heck, HOTH it might have sounded bad then, but compared to PG it looks like a jewel now!
B0000A118M|5.0|John Coltrane, Elvin Jones, McCoy Tyner, and Jimmy Garrison are acknowledged masters of their instruments in the field of jazz. From my 45 years in the jazz field I have not yet one jazz  musician who would not acknowledge this. <br />As a musician who was following jazz (and especially Coltrane) in the sixties, this record blew us all out when it first came out (with the exception of those who were hearing Trane live on stage or playing with him). It was one more amazing step in an amazing musical career of an amazing musical talent. 1964-65 was also very culturally craetive time in American music in general  <br />I am sorry to say that we expected this kind of expansive music to continue to expand and evolve, but as time has gone on (now almost 40 years later), this album stands out today as my favorite. I want to say that it is the best of the best, but that kind of discernment doesn't fit into the jazz ethos where each genre has its own unique flavor, expression, and contribution against an organic backdrop where there is not static standard. In other words, if I said best, then this may reflect negative on another work of art or artist that is no less exquisite or beautiful. here I am not desiring to compare, but simply to state that this set is uniquely powerful.   <br />Now some one who doesn't like jazz or didn't like \\"new jazz\\" might not like \\"a Love Supreme\\", but for some one who is open and listening there exists incredible power and beauty here --  love and wisdom in these sounds where these master musicians have dared to go! This is muisc that I can open up to and trust!Thank you Elvin, Jimmy, McCoy, and John!
B0000640SA|4.0|This movie is very well made, but it may be a bit tough for some people to digest. This movie starts you off at the &quot;end&quot; of the story and takes you back to the begining. You are immediately thrust into the life of a man with a type of memory loss that prevents him from remebering things for more than a few minutes at a time. He has no idea of what happened to him or why. The most ineresting thing about this movie is that for the most part you only know as much as he knows. This technique is very effective in that it keeps the viewer on the edge from the start of the movie to the surprising ending.<br />Viewers are likely to be very turned off by this movie because of its head spinning pace, but whether you love it or hate it I guarantee that Memento is a movie that you will not soon forget.
B00009RAJI|4.0|I was intrigued when I heard that this set would add the original version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; to the main Rumours album. So I was a little shocked when I heard it and realized that it isn't the original version (at least not the one I know from &quot;The Chain&quot; box set in 1992). They not only remastered it, but also remixed Stevie's vocals in the &quot;I'll follow you down&quot; section. What was formerly a supporting vocal (Stevie voice was multitracked) is now turned way up, and the effect is completely different (a lead vocal instead of a chorus of Stevies). It's interesting, but it's not the version I came to love. I think a remastered version should stay true to the intent of the original production. This is a revisionist version that would have been more appropriate to label as an &quot;alternate vocal mix&quot; on the bonus CD.<br />Of course, adding &quot;Silver Springs&quot; in the middle of the album is definitely a revisionist move. It works really well between &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;The Chain,&quot; but it would have been truer to the original album to put it at the end, clearly labeling it as a bonus track. Fortunately, these changes aren't as unfortunate as the the major modifications George Lucas made to another 1977 landmark, Star Wars. At some point, a work of art should be considered finished. Clear up the picture, clear up the sound, but don't turn it into something else.<br />&quot;Silver Springs&quot; definitely deserved to make the official album. In an interview, Stevie explained that Mick pulled her aside near the end of album production and explained that it was too long to fit on the album and they were going to record another of her songs, &quot;I Don't Want to Know,&quot; to replace it. Since &quot;Silver Springs&quot; is only about a minute longer than its replacement, I wonder if that was the real reason. Maybe they felt like side 2 was going to have too many downbeat songs. Whatever the real reason, &quot;SilverSprings&quot; wound up on the b-side to &quot;Go Your Own Way.&quot;<br />Stevie was always underutilized by the Mac, averaging about three lead vocals per album (and not many background vocal performances). I wish they'd recorded much more of her voice during this period when it was in a pristine state. The road, chain-smoking and drugs soon began to take a major toll. So it's nice to have the outtakes of &quot;Think About It&quot; and &quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot; on the bonus disk. Both later appeared on Nicks' albums (the former with extra lyrics on the bridge on &quot;BellaDonna&quot; and the latter missing some lyrics on &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La - only the CD maxisingle included the full-length, full-lyric version).

B00005JMJ4|1.0|What a waste of film and time. Not only did the movie lack any plot whatsoever, there was no climax. I waited for the movie to start, but it actually never did. The movie also inaccurately portrayed Japanese culture by focusing only on the young generation, and only on a minority of that group, nonetheless. It was almost insulting, and the critics who view this movie as &quot;pleasant&quot; are most likely the ones &quot;lost in translation.&quot;

B00005JLYW|1.0|I have to agree with the other negative reviewers here, this was absolutely, without a doubt, the WORST movie I have ever seen and I LOVE these woman. But to be completely honest I would MUCH rather just stare at a picture of them than watch this movie, that would be FAR more entertaining. Run away, run away as fast as you can.
B00006FIAZ|5.0|Like &quot;Storm of the Light's Bane,&quot; Dissection's &quot;The Somberlain&quot; is an atypical, yet brutal masterpiece of Scandinavian Black Metal. Dissection, in their debut have created a more melodic sound than most Black Metal bands, but their originality and technical mastery should not be overlooked. This is indeed one of the best Black Metal albums ever created. I am a bigger fan of death metal and power metal, and I have to admit that I like Dissection more than some of the bands in those categories. As for any fan of Black Metal, this CD is a must. Also check out &quot;Storm of the Light's Bane.&quot; Fans of Dissection should, of course, look into other bands in the genre such as Emperor, Immortal and Dimmu Borgir. Fans of this should also enjoy hybrid bands such as Opeth etc.

B0000U5RNU|1.0|Tried playing this DVD on an older Hitachi DVD player and on my computer. It was a 'no go' right from the start. Playback froze up on the DVD player and jumped around on the computer. I suppose this is the result of some brain-dead anti-piracy feature. Rowan Atkinson could play the role of the Universal exec who thought that up!
B000084T18|2.0|Ok,it all began in 2003.This guy named 50 Cent came on the scene with &quot;Wanksta(a diss at Ja Rule for being fake,which also sounds like a rap a 6th grader would use to start a slap-fight)&quot; but he really became famous when his I-wanna-kill-myself-if-I-hear-this-song-again annyoing hit &quot;In Da Club&quot; went #1 for 9 WEEKS!After that,there was no escaping him.Now I'm not usually one to hate on people,but this album sucks.Period.At first,I was in 50's spell,thinking that this guy was gonna change hip hop back to talent.But then,I listened to the whole album and I realized that any idiot rapper can make up the lyrics let alone the beats to all of the songs(one exception being &quot;Many Men&quot;)!All he talks about here is getting high,shooting people,having so many hoes under his belt,having so much money and jewelry(which,by the way,he isn't even famous yet),and he drills into your head the fact that he GOT SHOT 9 TIMES!Just because you got shot lots of times,it doesn't mean you own the respect of everyone in the ghetto(example:me!)<BR>Sure,the album has some good points,like the fact that he fooled people for a pretty long time,and I have to admit,some of the songs are very infectious,until you hear them 5 times in 10minutes and you're at the Empire State building with a gun in your head yelling to the world &quot;I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF!&quot;Now,I'm not forcing you to not buy the album,I'm just reommending you not to,unless you wanna waste your money on a big pile of nothing!
B000002JPA|5.0|I was recomended Dream Theater and found out one of their best cds was &quot;Images and Words.&quot; I went off and bought it. I listened to the opening song &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; and I thought that might be the way of the cd. Long hard rockers. The song itself is tremendous and is the loudest on the cd and my  2nd favorite. &quot;Another Day&quot; came on and I knew I was wrong with the direction of the cd. It is a kinda slow little ballad. As a song it is great and I think it shows alot of emotion. &quot;Take the Time&quot; was next and I got a feel for what the rest of the cd woulkd be like.The song is different, but great. Then played my least favorite song on the cd &quot;Surrounded&quot;. It just isn't really my style. The next song was &quot;Metropolis pt.1:The miracle and the sleeper&quot;. First off I want to say this song has a really cool name. It is great, but the keyboards in the middle can get a little bit annoying after awhile. &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; was next and I really like that song. Then came &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot; which is a nice little 2-minute piano solo. Dream Theater saved my favorite song for last &quot;Learning to Live.&quot; It is an amazing song. Great lyrics, Great everything. This is a great cd, although it is different it is a stunning masterpiece.
B00006AW2G|5.0|From 68-72 the Stones released Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Get yer ya-yas out(live) and Exile on Main Street. This was, arguably - but not by true music buffs - the greatest 4 year run of rock music ever released. If you haven't explored it, if you're younger than maybe, 34 or so, PLEASE invest a few bucks and explore the Stones when they were lean, mean, decadent, unconsciously perfect, and transcendent. Absolutely definitive rock n roll music, by the masters. The Beatles were brilliant, but the Stones defined the attitude that has set so many of us free.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Well, the special effects and other features are brilliant and groundbreaking, but this movie lacks the clear focus of the first and the inventive adventure of the second. Since now virtually anything imaginable can be done flawlessly with CGI the effects almost become unimportant. What matters most is story-structure and character, and the Wachowski's laid an egg here. <br />It's basically the last part of a soap opera that could have been deep and meaningful but is instead a kind of active comic-book storyboard sequence. This movie would never stand by itself - there just wasn't a lot of life in these people.<br />My largest quibble is..how does Neo start 'blowing up' things in the real world?  The only explanation is ... that there's another layer of abstraction, underneath both men and machines, and Neo is God in that one also??  It's a purposely un-answered question that effectively turns the story from being a wonderful platform for all sorts of philosophy, into a big pot of BS mumbo-jumbo.  I couldn't digest this mess - so I didn't really care after a while.  <br />Other minor quibbles..<br />1) Neo and Agent Smith had lots of punch-fests in #1 &amp; #2. The conclusion, with Neo 'melting' into Smith and blowing him up, was the same end as #1.  I suppose he was supposed to 'transcend the fight' again, like Buddha fighting Satan, approaching Nirvana.. Gimme a break - it's been done already.<br />2) Neo goes blind.. This seemed like a contrived plot-device.  Ooh he can see without his eyes - what a spiritualist!<br />3) The starting point with the Merovingian was pure comic-book pulp - it added nothing and was a waste of time.<br />4) I know from experience that people fighting giant mechanical squids usually wear body-armor. leaving them exposed like that was ridiculous.  Or one could say the whole battle was corny, because it would have been easier for the Machines to just Nuke Zion.  There are a lot of similar plot holes, I'm starting to ramble.<br />5) Lastly, the end of he story is not fulfilling - the Matrix continues, so really this is a push-off between opposing forces.  We all wanted the defeat or death of the Architect.  He was the enemy of humanity.  Saving Zion was important, but it was a distraction - I'm amazed that the Wachowski's didn't recognize this.  They had to kill that pompous old dude! Why did they hold back??<br />So now we're set up for sequels forever in a franchise.  Somehow I'm not really forward to them any more.  Too bad.
0385512104|5.0|this book is GREAT! it brings you to a whole new style of writing and reading. i REALLY enjoyed the book and i know you will too!!
B00003CXCT|3.0|WHY?? WHY?? Why should I have to suffer with a SPECIAL EDITION only set?? Absolutely ridiculous!! Why would anyone want the original theatrical release of one of the greatest films ever??? (Please note the sarcasm). George Lucas needs to get his head out of his -- anyway, the Special Edition versions are like making a two-disc set of Citizen Kane and including 5 minutes of Carrot Top mixed in. Boo! Boo! If I wan't to watch Star Wars, I should have the right to watch whichever one I like best. While they're at it, maybe they should also release a set that has no Jar Jar Binks (in the newest films). Either way, I guess I will buy this, but nostalgia isn't important to George Lucas, just his \\"vision.\\" What a waste of plastic discs. Glad I got the originals on VHS!!! George Lucas sucks! At least a real filmmaker, Speilberg doesn't change his \\"vision\\"! Then again, he doesn't suck!
B0001AVZA8|4.0|This film is a breath of fresh air!  Finally a romance film where the characters are over the age of 50!  Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton have tremendous chemistry here, playing off each other with splendid veteran performances.  Jack has charm to burn, and Diane does her best work since &quot;Annie Hall.&quot;  The script is oftentimes witty and timely, while at others swaying toward conventional romantic plotting.  Overall, this was a solid, enjoyable film from beginning to ending credits.  Later.
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down.  I read many online reviews and cannot believe people are getting caught up in the fact that it's not all based on fact, etc.  This book is FICTION!<br />There are many things BASED on facts, but it's FICTION!  Enjoy it for what it is and you're in for a wonderful read!  I was hoping the ending would not disapoint me and I was thrilled that it didn't.  It's a must read for those who love to read for the enjoyment of it.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is one of those cds that I can still sing every lyric to every song with the same excitement as when I first listened to it. The funny thing is that the lyrics make even more sense to me now then when I first heard them. This is full of teen angst but it is also full of themes of freedom and not wanting to fall into the boredom of mainstream. My favorite time to listen to Dookie is on a road trip, when I can roll down the windows and scream these songs as loud as I can. Talk about a release!! This cd is absolutely perfect for the rebel within. If you were between the ages of 12 and 30 during the '90s then you should already own this amazing work of art.
B000084T18|5.0|I have the biggest crush on 50 Cent.  Every time I hear those sogs &quot;In da club&quot; and &quot;21 Questions&quot; I get so excited and think of his hot body.  The rest of this album is amazing.
B00005JLKB|5.0|If you liked the series a few years back (Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman) then you will love this even more. The special effects start off a little corny, but by the third or fourth episode they get a little more professional and risky. Tom Welling is one of the better actors in the beginning, but the others seem to be taking acting lessons and catch up with his performance. Since this is a WB series, the love plots get a little carried away and complicated. This series will make girls melt at the love stories and guys grunt at the action. A car gets blown up every few episodes, and nice ones roll out with a 20-somethings Lex Luther behind the wheel. This series shows his relationship with his father as a possible contributing factor to his future evil life. In the mean time, he is Clark's best friend.<BR>This series is all about Clark developing his powers and finding out the real story of what happens before little Clarkie-boy grows up to become SUPERMAN!!!
0515127485|4.0|Robert Harris adroitly weaves together historical fact and a healthy dose of fiction to create a perculiar sequence of events that compose the backbone of &quot;Archangel&quot;.<br />British Russian history professor and Stalin expert Christopher &quot;Fluke&quot; Kelso is attending a symposium in Moscow with fellow academicians.  Kelso, in his room at the Ukraina hotel is listening to a story being told to him by an elderly Russian septagenarian Papu Rapava.  Rapava was once an army  lieutenant and driver to the Chief of Secret Police and member of Stalin's inner circle, Lavrenty Beria.  Beria was summoned to Stalin's residence to learn that his boss, the general secretary had been felled by a debilitating stroke.  While lying on the floor semi comatose, Beria pilfered a key around Stalin's neck and opened his safe.  He seized a black oilskin writing book which contained the murderous and suspicious despot's most personal correspondence.  Beria with the help of Rapava buried the book in a secret location.<br />Beria had soon been executed in a power struggle for the reins of leadership in the Soviet government.  Rapava was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in the Siberian gulag.  The book remained hidden.<br />Rapava's tale motivated Kelso to search for the legendary book.  Using Rapava's daughter Zinaida, a part time hooker, part time law student, Kelso against the wishes of varied Russian agencies schemed to recover the prized book.<br />Harris did a nice descriptive job in his depictation of present day Russia, stuck between the old ways of Communism and the bleak incomplete democracy that exists today.
014028009X|5.0|I finished this book within a week. That is quite the accomplishment coming from a self-described slow reader and avid tv watcher. I abandoned tv for a bit and stayed up until I couldn't keep my eyes open any more. <br />This book was truly entertaining and I could relate to Bridget being a singleton and having smug marrieds as friends. <br />This book is written as if it were in fact someone's diary. The reader is allowed to peek into Bridget's diary. It looks very much like other diaries in the fact that she writes everything down from her weight to how many cigarrettes she had on a daily basis. It is quite entertaining and a relief to see that the singletons seem to be obsessed with the same things, no matter what country they are in at the moment. <br />Bridget Jones's Diary started me on my love of the Chick Lit genre. A must read for any girl, especially the singletons out there. The book is better than the movie, though the movie was a great addition to the movie.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I am addicted with the radio and find out artist this way. I remember hearing follow through and filed it away in the back of my mind. Some few months later i was browsing sites and i got the lyric  &quot;Oh, this is the start of something good Don't you agree?&quot; stuck in my head. I looked it up and found out that he sang it. I remember hearing the CD for the first time in my dads car moments after I bought it, I was expecting another songwriter pop singer like John Mayer but this CD blew me away.  It's something different from what is out now. It has more of an mature sound to it than the others (like something you would hear in an adult alternative station instead of a pop station). He sounds like he has been around for years and knows what he is doing. My personal favorite song is &quot;More than any one&quot; It is a song that you can grab your special someone and slow dance to.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Clapton's rendition of Johnson's songs are too clean and polished and lack &quot;soul.&quot;  I was a little dismayed that the CD wasn't just Clapton and an acoustic guitar.  I was also dismayed that Sweet Home Chicago, Terraplane Blues, and Dead Shrimp Blues were not tracks on this album.<br />It is a decent effort by a great guitar technician, just not what I consider true &quot;delta&quot; blues.
0375701427|1.0|I didn't think a book so thing could repeat itself so many, many (many) times.  Roughly on page 2, you will get the point. But, foolishly, you'll stick it out, thinking, well it won all these awards, there's going to be some fine payoff later, a twist, some depth, some profound dimension.  You will not be rewarded. I suppose that's the point? <br />I wish I could say this style of writing was unusual for roth. Each individual sentence isn't so bad, even good, but taken as a whole, they amount to much, much (much) less.
0743454529|2.0|I laughed out loud.  The greatest problem with this author is that she writes to try to pull a reader's heartstrings, instead of telling a story.  When the plot's as convoluted as this, that's a real problem.<br />Anna was born with a distinct purpose.  To be a genetic donor for her sister Kate, who has a rare disease.  At age thirteen, when her family schedules a kidney transplant without her consent, Anna takes them to court.  Bad, unrealistic courtroom drama ensues (In a case like this, where she's basically accused of infringing upon Anna's human rights, her mother Sara shouldn't represent herself, even with a law degree), and honesty is sacrificed for more wooden metaphors.  <br />Picoult tries too hard with said metaphors.  At one point, about to testify, Anna looks at her skirt, and notices that it is unraveling a bit.  'Perhaps I will unravel the whole thing' she says.  As if we couldn't tell that the unraveling skirt was a symbol of the story about to be told.  Either Picoult thinks we're all idiots, or she's trying way too hard to be deep.  <br />The story is told from multiple viewpoints; Anna, her mother, lawyers, etc.  Instead of giving us everyone's feelings, it just leaves us confused.  The author changes fonts to indicate another person speaking, as if that makes it easier.  The result is that no character becomes truly fleshed out.<br />Probably my biggest gripe is the fact that Picoult chooses to go for 'heart wrenching' melodramatic metaphor over honest emotion.  Honesty wins every time, but apparently the author doesn't know that.  The greatest example is the big surprise at the end of the book.  I can't say what happens, but it relates to a choice Anna's mother makes, and how quickly she makes that choice.  Any mother put in the position Sara finds herself in would behave in a different, more human manner.  But no, Picoult chooses to 'try to make us cry', which resulted in me feeling utterly disgusted and wondering if any editor stopped to consider how ridiculous and inhuman the scene was.  Considering this author is praised as someone who understands human thoughts and emotions, I was shocked.<br />Tack on an obvious, schmaltzy ending with a very pat closing line and you've got yourself something wooden, unrealistic and seriously trying too hard.  This isn't really bad writing.  It's worse.  It's an apparently capable writer passing on the meat of human emotions for lukewarm, metaphorically overladen erudite fluff.  Very unappealing indeed.
0743442539|5.0|I didn't actually read the book, but I listened to an audio version.  This is one of the best spy novels ever.  It takes time to build, but the ending is shattering.  As a reader, you find yourself playing out complicated fact scenarios from each character's point of view.  From one point of view, the facts reveal one truth; from another the same facts reveal a completely different story.  Which one is true?  More importantly, which one will the characters believe?  If what you like about spy novels is the tortured logic spies use (&quot;If you know that I know that you know that I know....&quot;), this is what you are looking for.
0385512104|5.0|As the parent of a child with Asperger's, this book was nothing short of a revelation to me.  Though Haddon is not a psychologist his experience with autistic children obviously led him to have incredibly perceptive insight into what goes on in the mind of an autistic person.  I can't count the number of times that I read certain thoughts or observations of the main character and thought to myself &quot;This all makes sense to me now!&quot;  It was just unbelievable.  The writing by itself was well-crafted and creatively done, and it lends tremendously to the way in which the story is told from the perspective of this boy.  I also thought that Haddon did a good job in expressing what it can be like for a parent of an autistic person and the stress and frustration that comes from trying to raise a person who lives under a different understanding of life than the rest of us.  I read this book in one sitting and have recommended it to all my family and friends as a way to get some insight into how an autistic person meets reality.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd is great don`t let everyone trick you. Kayne  has got both a the r&amp;b and rapping down pat. The songs are tight. I love this and dont travel anywhere without it.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|True, this album does have it's moments, like Rainmaker and Dance of Death, but if you ask me, most of the CD sucks. I'd rather stick with Powerslave and Brave New World in the future then this.
0385504209|4.0|...that begin with the words: &quot;As a Christian...&quot; (puff, puff)<br />Soooo, as a Christian, I loved this book. I wasn't offended, incensed, outraged, aghast or otherwise in need of a 7-day cleansing ritual in a far-off dusty place. Ok, somebody pass me the holy water, I may need to sprinkle my keyboard now.<br />Seriously, it gave me an entire banquet of food for thought, and I do feel the need to delve deeper into some of the areas that gave me pause. As a former flaming atheist, that part of me reveled in some aspects of the book. But the whole of me who now claims my stake at the table of the family of God sees plenty of good in the questions.<br />Do I take Brown to be a pop-theologian who has now turned Christianity as we know it/knew it on its head? Hardly. Really, his ideas are nothing new under the sun...they have merely found a vehicle for mass marketing in a not so spectacularly well-written, but highly compelling book. (I'm no genius, but I figured out all of the cryptograms with just the first clues.) It was fun and fast-paced read.<br />If anything, I think many Christians suffer from microgodism...if God is so small that this book is a threat, the faith really is doomed.
B000002J03|5.0|This is my favourite Led Zeppelin album. Everything is just great!!! The vocals, guitar, drums, bass... everything!!! But who really surprised me was JPJ on bass. I always liked him, but when i heard this CD I started to LOVE him. Great catchy bass lines are all over the album. Well... the bass line on Whole Lotta Love is pretty lame, but it fits perfectly into this simple energic song. But the others... it's a heaven for a bass player. Especially Ramble On. But, enough about the bass. Guitar riffs are just totally great! It includes the classic Heartbreaker, which has one of the best guitar riffs ever. Page's guitar is just great, simple, but inovative riffs and excelent, stunning solos. Vocals are great too. When you hear Robert Plant singing... well, today we can find many original rock singers, like Perry Farrel from Jane's Addiction... but Robert Plant with Freddy Mercury are my favourites. And John Bonham? Well, I can't say anything that you didn't heard a million times: GREAT GREAT GREAT!!! There are few more words to say. Words like: inovative, revolutionary, awesome... This album includes the all time classic drum solo Moby Dick. The beginning is great, the end was quite boring for me. And it all ends with Bring It On Home. What can I say? Total blues, baby!!! Are you a guitarist? Then You must have it!!! Are you a bassist? Then You must have it too!!! Are you a drummer? Go on and buy it!!! And if you want to sing in a rock band you must buy as all the other Led Zeppelin albums!!! Buy it now!!! I said BUY IT!!! :)
0446310786|4.0|I see that this book hasn't been rated since 2002, man I hope someone will read this rating. I thought the book to be interesting and thoughful. Maybe I missed something in the reading but It wasn't as grand as it was hyped up to be it was just an okay book. The movie version was better.
B00005NGAK|1.0|Well, I am going to be very blunt about this video.  I was most disgusted with the dancing- it was vulgar. My children were sitting and watching it with me when we got it and my kids walked out of the room on their own. I have been very protective of the things I put in front of my kids and I see the fruit of our protection.  They do not see this kind of movie as entertainment- my daughter said that it was disgusting- <br />I am going to throw my video in the garbage.  IF you want to watch celtic dancers throw themselves  at each other while dancing then you would enjoy this.  The drama was seductive/ suggestive and I thought completely unnecessary.  <br />I love celtic dance.  I love to dance it and I love to watch it, but I did not come away thinking about what great dances there were in this video.  What stands out to me is all of the drama created- Michael who seems quite wrapped up in his self in this video,  and the \\"bad\\" lead lady- her dancing could very well be seen in a nightclub for men only!! <br />Drama is great with dancing but should accent the dance not distract from it.  Celtic is such a fun dance and \\"Feet of Flames\\"- just perverted it.  Definitely not a movie for impressionable children/teens!!!!!
B0000CFW87|4.0|hm..what can you say about Josh Groban?  He is a tremendously talented young man who knows what works best with his voice.  Granted, most of the songs are on the sad and melancholy side, but they are presented in a way that makes you remember with a sigh what love and life are about.  He's mature, warm tone and sound lend themselves to make the songs come alive to the point where you can visualize a scene in your mind with ease. I look forward eagerly to following the path that he takes with his next venture.
B000000H66|5.0|Intense music with a amazing sound... The most amazing piece of music is found right here by death!I have to say after being a fan of death for long, im quite proud of them!If my band ever gets a record deal i sure would love to tour with death,immolation, &amp;,cephalic carnage!! Thats  like my top 3 fav bands now! Im obsses with all of them 3 right there!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|The second I came to realize that Australian rockers Jet were being fried like bacon in the hype-pan from both NME, Q, Kerrang, and so on, I suspected a folly of an album.<BR>When I then realized that Jet had done a Dandy Warhol and sold their song to a Vodaphone commercial, I decided that I was right all along and that this band probably would be shown off for the frauds they surely must be.<BR>Indeed, when I got hold of the album, I felt that Jet was nothing in particular.<br />Then one day I was half asleep and the record was playing, swaying around number seven, \\"Radio Song\\".... the music stopped and suddenly \\"Get Me Outta Here\\" firekracked through the speakers and blew me off the sofa.<BR>Holy moly... this rocks.... really, with the intensity of Glory Days Rock Music from the 70's or so.<br />At best, that's what Jet will do to you.<BR>Because, in reality, they really are nothing in particular... they are embarrasly unoriginal and pathetically hyped... but a good day they can, without compromise or intelectual intention, fire you up... for real.<BR>Much of the effectivity of the band comes from ambition, of course. The songs are played with attitude, youth, desire and emotion... why wouldn't these songs rock?<BR>Most of the ballads are thin, almost amateur, but they also show that Jet is not neccisarely a made-for-hype-band. They twist and turn from garage, The Who-rock, wide Oasis-like ballads and even a little Sator (or perhaps that's only me...)<br />Jet works, but they are less compromised than you'd expect. That suggest real talent, making Jet probably a more promising band than the hype will let us understand.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Little wonder that the Beatles broke yet more records with &quot;1&quot;. The fastest selling and biggest selling cd ever!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I was a little unsure at first to get this cd, for I only heard their video and saw some advertisments for their cd as well. But, I took a leap and bought it. And i tell you, this is my favorite cd yet! This mixes hardcore metal with melodic punk-like styles. Its simply perfect! They posess so much talent for a hardcore band and the best thing is Shadows (lead vocals) can actually SING!!! And is a very good singer at that! Its very rare nowadays to hear someone that can actually sing and scream just as well. Overall, this cd is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and its definately a ride I want to take over and over again. Vengeance (lead guitar) is simply amazing, and the guitar really sticks out to me, because im a guitarist as well. The riffs never get old, and they are all pleasant to listen to and they are very creative. Its about time a good hardcore band has come out. A couple songs have really stuck out to me and they are \\"Unholy Confessions\\" (probably the best song on the cd) and \\"Chapter Four\\" also a great melodic metal driven song. If you like Atreyu and As I Lay Dying as much as I do, you will LOVE this cd! 5 stars all the way!
B000002UB3|5.0|Wasn't abbey road there all time most succesful album worldwide?Anybody know?
B00004W52U|5.0|Some albums are a nexus and a microcosm all their own. This is one of them. This little collection of tunes will still be kicked around speakers and radio stations fifty years from now. I have no doubt of it. This album never fails to animate and invigorate the souls of those who hear it, it's a virus in the classic Burroughsian sense, but a virus that fortifies and awakens those who are lucky enough to catch it: This music is passion in its rawest and most vitriolic form.<br />I'm sure you remember where you were when you first heard Op Ivy. I'm sure that, like me, you got it then and still get it now, you felt like you had discovered something so unbelievable and exceptional- you wanted to share it with everyone important to you.<br />I put this on and remember for a second what it was to be young and venomous, what it was like to believe that music could change the course of human destiny... For so many of us, coming of age in the early 90's- Op Ivy was our Clash, or perhaps one of those bands that caught their torch and ran with it.<br />All of which is to say, my affectations and bellicose meanderings aside: this is not a CD. This is the file in the cupcake. They had the balls to sneak it into your cell. The rest is up to you.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Absoluetly worth seeing and owning. Depp and Pacino are fantastic in this true story of Joseph D. Pistone, special agent for the FBI. <br />It is a chilling and moving performance. Children should not see this movie. The language and violance reflect the true lives of the NY mob.

B0001L3MI0|3.0|This is a fun movie at times but overall it is quite weak! The effects are amazing at times then extremely crappy at other moments! The acting is terrible, and the direction is not that strong. Overall this is and ok movie and will probably become a camp classic in the future (You know its true!)
B00006ADGP|5.0|This movie is actually called \\"A Special Day\\"... (...)<BR>Two of Italy's greatest stars, Sophia Loren & Marcello Mastroianni, are united in this special film about two very special people. The day is May 8, 1939, the day of a huge rally celebrating Hitler's visit to Rome. But this serves only as a background to the meeting of a world weary housewife, Sophia Loren, and her (...) TV announcer neighbor, Marcello Mastroianni.<BR>They meet, make love and change each others lives with anger, tenderness, comedy and self-searching. A remarkable film.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|I have reviewed this movie at 3 stars, entirely because I'm a huge dork and love vampire movies.  Upon a second watching, though... these folks really could have tried harder.  The premise is salvagable, and the overall look and feel of the movie, while not particularly new, ain't bad.<br />But now I have to wonder...<br />Why in the HECK do Viktor, Markus and Amelia have to hibernate?  What's the point in being immortal if you spend two of every three centuries asleep?<br />Aside from being able to jump off of buildings and frown a lot, what's the benefit of being a vampire?  They never leave the house, they drink packaged blood, and all (except Selene and Viktor, of course) get their butts kicked by the lycans on a regular basis.<br />Where does this take place?  There are European addresses and license plates, but when a reference is made to Amelia being on the other side of the &quot;great ocean&quot; yet arriving by steam train, I got confused.<br />WHEN does this take place?  They refer to Alexander Corvinus (from whom vamp and lycan both decended), becoming immortal because of some fluke encounter with Black Death in the 15th century.  Viktor talks about the &quot;chain&quot; of vamp elders being unbroken for 14 centuries.  So... the 29th century?  I don't get it.<br />Yes, I own it.<br />Yes, I watch it.<br />Yes, I think it's fun.<br />But I'm a dork.  I'll tolerate weak backstory and weak plot if the movie's dorky enough.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|This isn't a brilliant cinematic accomplishment by any means, but it is definitely an entertaining story. Julia Roberts portrays an art history professor from Wellesly who has a difficult time adjusting to the fact that most of her brilliant students have no professional ambitions of their own and simply want to get married and have babies when they graduate from college. Roberts is excellent in the film, but the younger actresses are also very good, most notably Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, and Ginnifer Goodwin.<br />Some people will probably be turned off by the attitudes about women that are depicted in the film, but that's the way things were done 50 years ago, and the fact that we're so bothered by it when we watch the film shows that the director has done a fine job. What bothered me about the movie was the way that several of the characters interacted with each other. Dunst's character was NASTY, and in the course of a two-hour film, she exposes her best friend's deepest secret to a large crowd, lies to one of her friends and convinces her that her boyfriend is cheating on her (he's not), calls another friend of hers a tramp (once again, in front of a crowd), and writes several controversial editorials in the school paper that everyone disagrees with. After all of that, no one really lashes out at her at all. It's true that Dunst's character is coping with her own problems, but I don't think that any girls would let their friend get away with all the crap that Dunst pulls in the movie. I was hoping that someone would haul off and slap her at the end, but no one did, and that was disappointing.<br />There were also some things that bothered me about Julia's character, especially the fact that such a strong and independent woman would have an affair with a professor who was openly sleeping with his students. That was a major thing that I didn't understand at all.<br />All that aside, though, it was still an entertaining movie. My boyfriend called it a &quot;chick flick,&quot; and I agree that the film probably appeals to women more than it does to men. It's worth watching, though, and I'd recommend it to everyone.ck flick,&quot; and I agree that the film probably appeals to women more than it does to men.

B000001EXR|1.0|What a bad album the songs on here are dreadful.Do YOURSELF a massive favour forget this album even exists.
B000002J03|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time by one of the greatest bands of all time, Led Zeppelin II still stands the test of time and rocks just as hard now as it did when it was first released.  At this point in their career, they still had their feet firmly in the \\"Englishman's take on American Blues\\" territory, but were also moving forward into the pure Rock and Roll genre they would soon rule over.  Many Zeppelin fans argue which is the best Zeppelin album, and I have to go with this one.  It's a step up compared to their debut album, which was a little more bluesy and had more of the Yardbirds (Jimmy Page's former band) feel.  This album comes before they got huge and pretentious and gained worldwide fame with Led Zeppelin 4, which contained the massively overrated (yes, I'm sorry, it's overrated) Stairway to Heaven.  My favorite track is definitely \\"Bring it on home to me\\", which starts smooth and bluesy, and kicks it in with a brain banging riff.  \\"Moby Dick\\" Rocks, plain and simple.  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a Rock and Roll standard, with it's great chorus and curious breakdown.  Every track on this album, however, is a winner.  If you need to be fully Rocked, this album will NOT let you down. Rock and Roll!

B0001HAHXW|4.0|Knowing how Eric has been a long-term Robert Johnson disciple, I was expecting this to be one of the crown jewels of his recording career.  I was let down, which is not to say that it's at all a BAD CD, just that it's not very bluesy and hardly delta at all.  It's more like party music.  I was hoping for voice and acoustic guitar, but this reminds me of a 40's or 50's era juke joint R&B band.  Piano, drums, harmonica, bass, electric guitar.  The playing is excellent, the singing is fine, but the songs were given sort of a modern pop gloss.  What happened to the haunting edge and desperation that made these songs famous in the first place?  Where is the gut-wrenching pain?<br />I've given this 4 stars and had to stretch a ways to get there.  It's really closer to 3 in my mind right now, but I'm hoping it makes it to 4 after I get conditioned by repeated listenings.  so far, it sounds like EC's hellhound is named \\"Muffy\\".
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Master and Commander was a wonderful film, one of the best of the year.  It captured many of the things that make Patrick's O'Brian's books stand head and shoulder above others of the type -- the music, the natural world, the real feel of the ship. It skimps a bit on the character of Dr. Maturin, but does a very good job with Aubrey.<br />But ...  why, when the two-disc version of most movies -- complete with deleted scenes, making of specials, etc. -- are the standard, are they charging a premium for the two-disc version of Master and Commander (with a cheaper addition for those who just want the movie).  It's not like the Lord of the Rings films:  the special edition is not a four-disk extended edition. It's the same sort of two-disk set that we've come to expect for under $20 for most films.  I really hope they drop the price of this sometime soon.
B000002MFN|5.0|why is this album still out of stock after so many months? the only thing i can think of is that hopefully the record company withdrew it a while ago so they could re-release a remastered version (as they did with her first 3 albums) That would be awesome.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|Not since Deep Blue Sea have I cared so little about the protagonists of a movie and never have I felt the urge to drink heavily more genuinely than during this movie. I had been hoping for the best after a film (Reloaded) that disappointed me in more ways than I could count. <br />Oh dear. <br />After 50 minutes I stopped watching the clock and reached for the fast forward button. You could cut an hour and a half out of this film and it still wouldn't actually resolve anything but it would at least be watchable. <BR>The main protagonists have much less screen time than previously leaving us struggling to identify a sequence of grungy extras. Perhaps people who had watch Reloaded more recently before seeing this would know who they were, to me they added nothing but confusion. <BR>The action sequences while chock-full of cgi bored me rigid. We watched the same thing again and again. It's not impressive when it's like that, it's just dull and why, oh why didn't those stupid humans just set up a sequence of EMP devices outside Zion and shield / turn off the electronics inside? Did they want to die? Why would the machines honour an agreement with a species they'd been using and exterminating?<br />Most of all, what was the point?<BR>The Matrix leaves the audience with a good romp and the best of endings for this type of story, one open to possibilities. Of all the possibilities out there, what prompted them to choose this one? Ultimately the premise of the matrix is full of holes and requires heavy suspension of disbelief. This works for one film. When you then rely on that weak premise, indeed expand upon it, all you do is draw attention to the holes.<br />I recommend you watch the first one only and don't let your curiousity drag you into giving four hours of your life to the sequels.
0385720920|5.0|This is one of the most weirdest novels I have ever read. Choke is about Victor; a dropout from Medical School who is trying to help his mom in a nursing home, so in order to keep her there, he has to pretend to choke on food to make someone a hero. They send him money, and with that money, he pays the people taking care of her. So now, Victor goes to sexual addiction meetings where he has sex with the attendies and also his mother's doctor. His friend then nurses rocks in order to build something but we dont know until the end. So now, as we see this, Chuck branches away from Victor about him choking on food, and we see in Victor's childhood where his mom takes him cross-country painting shadows of him and teaches him some weird stuff. He then discovers that when his mom was in Italy, she took Jesus's semen and planted it in her, so he is Jesus' kid! Then his friend builds a temple full of rocks and the rest I dont remember because it was just weird. The ending was not all that good, but the writing was very good, but also very repeative and can get kind of frustrating. The sex scenes were kind of graphic and there was a lot of sex in this novel. It is worth reading, but nothing like King's writing. Chuck is not another King, but he can write. Good book, but just WEIRD!
0385504209|2.0|It's hard to believe this book has generated so much hype.  Brown is nothing much more than a Robert Ludlum wannabe; to call him a pale imitation is too charitable.<br />The book's improbable and (rather) abrupt denouement makes one wonder whether Brown suddenly exhausted his store of tiresome plot twists or, alternatively, his publisher simply (and mercifully) placed a hard ceiling on his page allotment.  Either way, the result is unsatisfying.  While Ludlum is no Graham Greene (or even a John Le Carre), he certainly does this kind of thing much better than Brown.<br />Brown's numerous historical canards have been well-documented elsewhere and serve only to further undermine this puerile effort.  And to think &quot;writers&quot; like Brown are the modern torchbearers of a Western popular culture that once included such giants as Dickens....
0452282152|5.0|I'm not quite finished with it, but I've found every page thus far to be a marvel.  Chevalier's polished lack of self-consciousness and sentimentality makes this book as fresh and crisp as the aprons in which young Griet takes pride in spotlessly maintaining.<br />Vermeer's household becomes its own self-contained, small nation, with rich details of its geography and features, delicious fly-on-the-wall vistas of political maneuvering, speechless reverence for its beauty and royalty, and the brutality and instability of life among its poor.  Griet herself is a masterpiece -- a keenly street-smart heroine carefully painted using only the media of the time -- mercifully absent of the sullen, contemptuous self-obsession and insatiable needs for attention exhibited by contemporary teens in our culture.<br />I can't wait to rent the movie!  I look forward to seeing Scarlet Johansson animate Griet.
0385504209|1.0|This book was the worst!  I laughed out loud the whole way through.  Dan Brown treats you like a moron so you feel like a genius when you solve the riddles before his world famous (but not very bright) experts do.<br />Two page chapters! Ridiculous dialogue!<br />If you've never before heard the theory that the bible might not have been written by God Himself, never used a library search engine, and never been outside of your home town, then this is a book of challenging ideas and exotic landscapes.<br />I admit it - I loved reading this book - but it's not getting any more stars from me!
B00008DDSC|2.0|Theatrical trailers sneakily suggested this was a twisted romcom, but this is one of those times when the trailer people created a different movie than the one you end up getting. Secretary's two leads are hard to like - a woman just out of an institution who cuts herself, and a largely unexplained sadistic lawyer. The romance, such as it is, has as its highlight a lengthy bottom smacking scene that will appeal only to people who like bottom smacking. The comedy adds up to perhaps half a dozen slight smiles. So yes, an unusual, even thoughtful film, but very far from a sexy date movie for most people. One of those DVDs you only play once.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|The Let It Be album has been insulted and ignored far too long.  Mr. Phil Spector did an awesome job with what were second class Beatle's songs and lazy performances.  &quot;Across The Universe&quot; was a masterpiece.  &quot;Let It Be&quot; was a major improvement over the single version.  &quot;Two of Us&quot; is perhaps the best.  Light and clear.  True &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; was overblown.  But it needed help.  Maybe got too much help.  But remember, Phil Spector did exactly what he was asked to do.  That being said, this is a GREAT album.  After all, it is The Beatles.  The songs are called second class Beatles standard.  That makes them great to me.  This album is NOT The Beatles swan song.  It is their last LP.  The music is great.  I wish it more closely followed the film.

020530902X|1.0|Based on reviews I read, I eagerly obtained a copy of this book.  When I got home and perused it, I was vastly disappointed it didn't measure up to all its hype.  Why?  It is too simplistic!  When looking for information regarding numerals, all it carries is a small paragraph about numerals in dates.  I was also looking for uses of the apostrophe.  Again, it only contains very limited data.  In continuing to look through this book, I have not found a single answer to my questions!<br /><br />A person who already has style basics under their hat should not spend their money on this book.  Instead, they should gravitate towards a larger style manual, which gives much more detailed information.  That is what I have done.  Many of these are available.

All I can say is, it was a pile of poo, and after seeing it I could only ask myself, \\"How could they have made the ending THAT bad?\\" The answer is on the dvd on the 2nd disk in form of a preview for the matrix online. It was a pathetic excuse so they could make an online game that picks up where the movies leave off. Thanks alot for ruining what could have been one of the best trilogies to try and make a few extra bucks Wachowski's! WHAT A WASTE!
B0001CNRB6|2.0|This is a great, classic comedy, but the DVD version suffers somewhat.  It has a sallowy, yellowish tint to it (not horribly so, but noticebly so) and is VERY fuzzy.  (And I'm not talking about the shots with the glamour filters.)  It is great to have this on DVD finally, but compared to some other Universal budget DVDs, this looks like it was rushed very carelessly into production.  The film deserved better.  5 Star Film / 2.5 star DVD.

B00005JLF5|2.0|I must admit right off the bat that DS9 was never a show I held close to my heart; The Next Generation was (and is) my favorite Star Trek series.  But nonetheless I decided to give the series another chance.  Unfortunately, I was still unable to embrace it.<br />There are only four episodes in this season that I would want to watch more than once and they are; The Emissary, The Forsaken, Duet, and In The Hands Of The Prophets.  The Forsaken is the weakest of the bunch, but I enjoy the insights into Odo's background and the nuances of Lawaxana Troi.  The other three rank with the best of Trek.  I was surprised at their high quality since the trest of the season was so lackluster.<br />Kira and to a much lesser extent Odo, are the only characters that piqued my interest.  Garak was great in his one and only appearance this season as well.  The rest of the cast was uninteresting, especially Sisko.  I'm sorry, but Avery Brooks is WAY too self-conscious (what's up with the overly precise enunciation and practiced gestures), hopefully he improves as the series goes on.<br />As for the DVD set itself, it's done very well for the most part.  I don't care much for the cases plastic slip cover and flip open design, but the book-like DVD trays are a welcome improvement over TNGs mile-long fold out.  The menus are designed to look like Cardassian control panels and offer the standard features, but gone are the film clipped episode buttons of the TNG set, DS9 only offers a still image which makes finding the episode you want to see all the harder if you're not familiar with the show titles.  The bonus disc is informative and done in the same style as the TNG bonus material except for the use of short `easter eggs' that are very easy to find.  I don't mind that they are easy to find, but if they're going to be so easy to find I wish that they'd rather just put them all in one selection.<br />I'd like to have rated this set higher since the four shows I liked, I thought were terrific, but as great as they are, they're not worth the full price.  If you're a fan of DS9, you'll love this set.  If you're new to the series, I'd suggest skipping this season and starting at season 4 which I hear is when the show shifted into high gear.rific, but as great as they are, they're not worth the full price.

B00000J8EK|3.0|Ok...sure, this album has its UPS for Under The Influence, Out Of Control, Let Forever Be, and Hey Boy Hey Girl...but...I was rather dissapointed on the \\"style\\" that they chose to make for the album to make you SURRENDER to them after hearing the Grammy Award Winner of Dig Your Own Hole.  Music: Response was an excellent introduction to the whole CD, but, after that, things started to go a little downhill with songs such as Orange Wedge and The Sunshine Underground.  I didn't feel that those songs went anywhere except for in their layed back way...I did love, however, that the song 'Surrender' was built up nicely from the very end of 'Hey Boy Hey Girl'.  I gave this album 3 stars for a lot of the downfall songs in the album.  It is still good to have though if you are a die hard fan of The Chemical Brothers.<br /><br />Thanks.
B000000LZV|5.0|I agree with alomost all of the previous reviewers of this album--this is definitely one of the best albums of any kind to come out of the 1980s.  One topic which I haven't seen addressed in the other reviews is the way the CD has been remixed.  The sound on the double LP is much better--punchier, and it doesn't sound as processed as the CD.  For example, it sounds as if D Boon's vocals have way too much reverb on them.  My recommendation, for those interested in this album, is to try and find the album on vinyl, and burn it from the vinyl.  You'd end up getting a better-sounding album, with all of the songs on it--some of which are ommitted from the CD.  Just be careful:  sometimes the gaps between the songs are only a fraction of a second long!
1892005034|3.0|I borrowed this book from the local library after it caught my eye, sitting on the &quot;new books&quot; display. It's a pretty good book, although I do have some reservations about it.<br />/Nonviolent Communication/ is a rather easy read. This is both good and bad - good, because you're not slogging through lots of academia-speak and technical jargon; but also bad because you might breeze through the book too quickly to truly absorb the rather useful and insightful information it is offering.<br />The idea behind the NVC process is rather simple - it's mostly about learning to be more precise in expressing your feelings, their cause(s), and what you would like done to resolve them. Rather than saying &quot;you never clean the !@#$ kitchen,&quot; the NVC approach would be to say something along the lines of: &quot;When you do not take out the trash in the kitchen, I feel __________.&quot; And so on. NVC also encourages you to be receptive to what other people are saying and feeling, even if (or perhaps especially if) they do not word things with as much precision and care.<br />The approach is very sound, but I have reservations about the way the book presents it. Most of the example conversations are so unbelievably robotic, at times I just wanted to laugh out loud at how absurd they were. My initial thought was that I was being unreasonable - after all, they're just words on a page, and perhaps they would seem less laughable in person with real emotion behind them. And then I realized that was the key that was missing - the conversations were little other than the facts of the situation, and the exact words the people said. There was no emotional context, no insight into the feelings that were being expressed. I found this to be extremely ironic. A book about expressing emotions, with lots of examples that HAD no emotion!<br />I think if you can get beyond the rather mediocre examples, and put genuine *thought* into the principles the author outlines, you will find much of value in the book. Before reading /Nonviolent Communication/, I didn't think much about how the imprecision in our wording can cause a great deal of conflict. &quot;You are so inconsiderate!&quot; versus &quot;When you leave your dirty dinner plate on the table and go watch football, I feel very angry. Would you please rinse the plate and put it in the dishwasher?&quot; It's a world of difference, and I believe there is much benefit to this approach.<br />Final thought: there's a lot of good stuff in this book, but the presentation could use some work. Read the book carefully, and do not go as quickly as the breezy writing style allows - the material here needs careful consideration for it to truly benefit you.

B000002H4Q|5.0|Alrighty, first off, you should probably know that I'm a die- hard Cure fan, so I may very well be a lil' biased.  I love all Cure albums equally, but this is the one I listen to most often because it's without a doubt the most versatile of all Cure albums.  It's got something for everybody, as any Cure fan will tell you.  The whole emotional spectrum is represented here, from extreme to extreme and everywhere in between.  Bonus?  This album is kinky as all get out.  You'll want to act out each and every one of these songs in the bedroom.  It's turned an alarming number of my &quot;normal&quot;, non-Cure fan friends into insatiable Robert Smith fetishists.  They've started demanding their ordinary jock boyfriends tease up their hair and wear eyeliner and smeared red lipstick.  It's utterly magnificent.<br />...That's really all I have to say.  I've started thinking about Robert Smith singing &quot;All I Want&quot; and now I'm a wee bit too distracted to go on with the review...sigh...I'll leave you with that.  Buy every Cure album ever released today.  Then play them to death.  Then buy the re-releases of all the Cure albums (complete with rarities) when they come out and you'll be able to fully appreciate them.  That's all I got.  Peace, Love and Robert Smith, y'all.  Meow.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is a great indication of where Hip-hop is going to be going to. If you look at it, people will now look at Mos Def, Talib kweli, and other more underground rappers, and will eventually phase out the: \\"Money, Cash, Hoes\\" mentality the premeates hip-hop right now.<br />Its also a great album in what Kanye, is trying to say. Its effectively the american dream. The ability to make it, regardless of sex, origin, religion, orientation, and other factors.<br />All in all: All the songs are radio worthy, but due to Clear channel broadcasting, \\"Jesus Walks\\" will never make it. Anyways, Great sound, nice raps. I love it!
B000003TA4|4.0|I still clearly remember the first time I heard the opening cords to Smells like teen Spirit.  The raking of the strings before a mighty explosion of drums and distortion.  I was there for music history, or at least around, it was 1991.  Ten years have passed since Kurt Cobain killed himself.  Now Cobain and the small punk band from Seattle are mentioned along the likes of The Beatles and the Sex Pistols.  Nevermind is truly an incredible album.  Outstanding in almost everyway, the album easily carries its weight as an all-time great.  Starting with those opening chords all the way to the hidden track.  It is as consistent as any great album and reviewed many times since the break out of grunge.<BR>I am writing this review to remind us of several things about Never Mind and Nirvana.   This album is a reaction or a result, to what was happening in music.  Nirvana and Never Mind have been given the miss leading title of the inventors of \\"grunge music\\".  Nirvana is looked upon as the creator of this style of music hailing from Seattle Washington. They are considered a leader and an inspiration to several other well know acts from the same area.  No one invented grunge music except for corporate America.  The so-called Seattle bands all had very distinct styles, and drew heavily from bands they admired in the scene or else where.  Nirvana was a punk rock band.  Drawing from the likes of  The Pixies and The Meat Puppets Nirvana hashed out their own brand of punk rock music. <br />Bands like Nirvana had been there all along.  Sound Garden and Alice in Chains both considered part of the \\"grunge\\" movement had albums out as early as 1988 (Sound Gardens the Fopp EP).  Nirvana came about as a result of the over playing, the over hyping, and the lack of integrity in what is now termed big hair rock.  The reaction was a swing towards the alternative, punk rockers that played their own style, dressed the way they wanted, and really didn't give a crap about it.  Nirvana opened this door (and maybe closed it) because the world was ready for it and because MTV played the snot out of the video. The album was as polished as it was accessible and it broke into main stream America. Later less accessible Nirvana albums would reveal an edgier and less refined band that would bear their punk roots and there indie rock influences.  <BR>The Movement was all over before it began and this truly great album may not have been the beginning but maybe the end of a great thing.  Nirvana may have not invented \\"grunge\\", but it did something greater for music and its fans.  Yes it rocked our socks off, but more importantly it told us it was OK to go out, be our selves, and discover our own music.
B00004TL21|4.0|Before going into detail about this album i'd like to say that i am very pleased and dare i say amazed by this albums follow up to their album &quot;Around The Fur&quot; which to me was below par for deftones due to the fact that the album had too much rap influences, and also it lacked the originality and majic this album and their debut had. However as for this album the Deftones are as original and experimental as can be, once again proving that not all nu-metal is bad. Vocalist Chino is better than ever showing us more of his stunning vocal ranges and abilities as show on Digital bath, and it looks like the drummer has outdone himself on this album showing us once again his excellent style, making him one of the best drummers in the nu-metal scene. As for the bassist and guitarist they are honestly quite somewhat decent at what their doing, however there not a band you look for if you want technical solo's(if that then just stick to dream theater), and the new percusionist seems to be quite handy for the deftones creating eerie and a moody atmosphere to the songs(digital bath, rx queen). Positives about this album that are worth taking note of, include that this album has a very high replay value, and that you can listen to this album in any mood, and this album also contains some of their greatest songs.<br />Some songs worthy of my approval include their slow atmospheric song &quot;Digital Bath&quot; which without a doubt deserves the hype its getting by their fellow fans. &quot;Knife Party&quot; is a well crafted medium paced song with graphic lyrics that will send shivers down your spine, and &quot;Passenger&quot; is a breathtakingly haunting song in the veins of &quot;Knife Party&quot;, with its memorable chorus, and Maynards groundbreaking vocals.<br />My only complaint about this album is that while this album like i said features some of their best songs, it unfortunatly features a few rushed ordinary tracks such as &quot;Feiticeira&quot;, &quot;Street Carp&quot; and &quot;Change&quot;, and although i said this album has a high replay value thats only because of those three terrfic songs i mentioned before. My last complaint is that this album is a tad overated, especialy its creativity, though this album still is creative. Otherwise aside from my negatives this album is great, the Deftones are once again holding the flag for nu-metal. Recommended
B00015YVDG|5.0|I usally dont care for remakes! This was a remake of a 1955 version with Donna Reed and Glen Ford. But this is much better the raw emotion of Mel Gibson and Renee Russo just made the movie just so completly come into place. I had tears in my eys through out the whole movie. The commentary with Ron Howard is great also. A must have for any collection!!!
B000002HH9|4.0|Okay, yeah, this is the only Cure album EVER to have a weak track.  Therefor, I cannot, in all good morality, give it the full five stars.  However, the good tracks make it all well worth buying.  Jeepers, if you're a Cure fan, you're in dire need of this album.  First off, you sit there and tell me you don't absolutely love \\"Jupiter Crash\\". It's magnificent.  Second of all, you're a human being and a Cure fan.  Robert Smith lamenting that he wants \\"more head\\" totally rules.  That goes for the other heap of blatant, ambiguity-free naughty bits in the album.  At one point he actually sings clearly about rubber fetishes.  And strippers.  (...) You can't look me in the eye and tell me that's not tempting.  Buy it.  Don't listen to the nonbelievers.  They simply don't understand...
0441172717|5.0|If you love stories full of political controversy, treachery, love, action, and survival, you will love this book.  It is the story of a Great House, House Atreides, forced to move to rule a desert planet where the native people have to wear suits to reclaim the body's moisture, and are shocked to hear of falling water from the sky and the such.  A large group of the natives are Fremen, people who live in the deep desert whose population and culture is unknown to the Imperium. The rival House, House Harkonnen, sets up a betrayal by the Atreides doctor and takes over the planet.  The Duke's son and concubine escape to live with the Fremen in the deep deseert, waiting for a chance to reclaim their planet.<BR>I could find absolutely nothing wrong with this book.  I am interested to see how the movies do it, since there are so many things in this book that can't be conveyed in images.  You must read this book!!!
B000059MEK|4.0|It took me a few years to get &quot;Around The World&quot; out of my head, only to be replaced by &quot;One More Time&quot;. What an excellent disc. Any fan of music over the past two decades should find something to like here, other than maybe country. It's kind of like putting &quot;Van Halen&quot;, &quot;Kool And The Gang&quot;, &quot;KMFDM&quot;, and &quot;Madonna&quot; into a blender. That's &quot;Daft Punk&quot;, simultaneously fresh and retro. Not every track here is a winner, but overall it's a nice ride. It'll definitely get you on your feet. &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; are two of my faves. These robots rock.
0676973779|4.0|I had a highly enjoyable experience reading this book. Though the idea or form for the book may bot be original or creative it is everything from the storytelling to the character and prose that make this book great. I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind.<br />Just a note to Rosemary Kennedy, Martel gives acknowledgement to Moacyr Scliar in the author's note at the beginning of the book.
0783240236|5.0|Hitchcock has always been my favorite director! The first time i saw the Birds I was mesmerized to say the least, plus the fact that it terrified me, but i still watched it anyways. The location shots are outstanding to say the least. Ive been up to Bodega Bay qite a few times in the past years and head for The Tides Restaurant and as soon as i make it home I pop in the vdv of the Birds! The color has been restored and its in WIDESCREEN<BR>for the first time ever.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Despite my moniker, I took an oath to never bathe in the Beatles reviews and yet, here I am.  After reading detractor after detractor, I think a big glaring point is being missed by the &quot;serious&quot; nay-sayers (not even giving credence to the one-liners who just want to spank someone on a review page).<br />Let It Be Naked is truely what the Beatles wanted, as everyone from George Harrison before his death, to George Martin as recently as the Anthology has said, Let It Be was intended to be a &quot;live in the studio&quot; recording.  So saying, why oh why did ANYONE, Martin, The Boys, or EMI ever allow Phil Spector (whose name sounds eerily close to a Bond movie villaneous organization) to incorporate that over-rated, has-been (in 1969), fluffed up &quot;wall of sound&quot; onto the music!  That defeated the purpose entirely and this album gives us what the Beatles wanted to give us, regardless of your thoughts on the Spector production, and regardless of who you think will make any money from this endeavor.<br />In these days of Beatlemania retroactive, this for one, was a breath of fresh air.  And yes, you can toss the extra disc, it's just more fluff, more Spectre!<br />A short one-two-three:<br />1.  The sound is incredibly good, raw but pure Beatles and very well engineered and produced.  It sounds &quot;real&quot; and it's the way it was meant to be.  Even a casual listener will enjoy this!<br />2.  The order might upset you since you are all used to &quot;the original&quot;, but once again, the evil Spectre put this together HIS way, and since the democracy of 4 has been reduced to 2, let's let them have their way, eh?  It is after all, THEIRS!<br />3.  For God's Sake, it's The Beatles!<br />Four stars because it's the Beatles and I can't bring myself to give them less at anything.  It doesn't deserve more, that's a fact, and maybe should be 3 and 1/2, but I'm feeling generous unlike others here.<br />If you are a Beatle fan and have every other album they ever put out, get this, it's not going to hurt you, and you might like it alot better than most of the tripe that ended up on the Anthology discs.they ever put out, get this, it's not going to hurt you, and you might like it alot better than most of the tripe that ended up on the Anthology discs.
0679879269|5.0|I didn't write a review for the other two books because I read them a while ago and my memory is a bit fuzzy (I don't remember where the books seperate), but they would also get 5 stars.  With that said, I loved this series, and this is my favorite of the books.  Their is a lot of romance in this one, along with a VERY sad ending, but it is still so beautiful because they find security in something I won't say.  I cried at the end.  It was the first time I had ever cried during a book. I felt incomplete without one of the books by my side.  It is a perfect ending to a perfect series.
B000002BBY|4.0|&quot;Oasis&quot; seemed to be kind of a &quot;Beatles&quot; of the 90's, or so they thought anyway. Though I don't think that was the case, this is indeed an excellent album, and I suspect it will always be their best. Many would say they were britpop at it's best, just not &quot;Blur&quot; fans. This does include a few of their biggest hits, like &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot;, and the great closer &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;. And while those songs do stand out, the rest are nearly as good. &quot;Hey Now&quot; and &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; I really like also. Front to back it's their best, and actually is one of the better albums of the decade.
B0000897DH|5.0|Who single handily influenced me, at a tender age of 12, to care about the suffering from the great flood that year, George did.  And, with kudos from my father, I brought my first ever Benefit Concert record that same year.  I am still proud to have had contributed to George's cause that year, and I know I am a better person today because of it.  Thanks to him and to my father for opening my eyes to the great many humanitarian causes and needs.<br />I still have the same record some thirty-two years later, and although I had brought the CD several years back, I think it is a high-time for me to buy a DVD to show my kids; my contribution to the Generation X I fondly call them, how a mass of people in this country, regardless of their race, age, gender, religion, all came together under one great flag that year and actually gave God something to smile about.<br />Rumors of financial scandal in the distribution of relief fund immediately following the year of the concert notwithstanding, the noble action of great many that year counts for something.  Also notwithstanding, a seemingly lack of sophistication in the making of that concert, but the musicianship and the genuine fan participation still out-shine many present day events.  A true `Jewel' and a true `Triumph of the Human Spirit'!  And it would be a shame and a mockery, if the re-issue of this watershed DVD were being debated today on the ground of profitability.  This event is a `Public Domain', and should belong to the entire human race.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I couldnt wait for this movie to hit the dvd shelves. Being a Judy fan from way back I just knew that Warner Brothers would do a bang up job and they did with this musical. I has been completly restored with all the vibrante colors back in the dvd. I had the vhs version and it was pretty washed out. The special features on disc 2 are outstanding. Although they could have had more trailers on the disc but thats ok. This movie will always be a timeless classic!!!
B00000294R|5.0|Big L had mad flows, RIP dogg, this album is for peepz who love tru rap, not that fake stuff out now a days, buy it, u wont be dissapointed, starts off hella tiite from begining
B0001932ZA|1.0|If you can still find it, get the original DVD release of this film, because the Special Edition 2-Disc set is the WORST DVD ever released! Meet the Stalkers is the least offensive of the extras included, but it is less like a DVD feauturette and more like some stupid thing you'd find on simpler, older video games. Game Theory is nothing more than a promotion for Survivor and other reality shows that have been polluting TV for years now. There is vague association with the movie, and a few clips, but is otherwise irrelevant and inappropriate. Then comes the biggest offender: Lockdown on Main Street. Artisan, what are you thinking?! I won't reiterate what has already been eloquently stated by other reviewers; suffice it to say that this is suppose to be a fun sci-fi flick, not some serious drama about civil rights or terrorism. Including this ultra-liberal, anti-government propaganda is beyong absurd; it's idiotic. Fire the &quot;brain trust&quot; who came up with this idea, and stop releasing nonsense like this. And please read the other reviews who address this outrage.
B000084T18|1.0|that was a retorical question.  because its stupid music for stupid people.  the fact is that you would not think your average crack-dealing scumbag could rap, so why would you start now?  this man is not smart, plain and simple.  people who aren't smart can't rap, just look at jay-z.  i laughed out loud when i heard he named his &quot;crew&quot; g-unit after damon albarn's concept group gorrilaz.  how unoriginal is that?  as i've read in the countless bad reviews here, this guys flow is inert(not in motion). its sounds like he has a mouth full of marbles, and everything sounds like trl trash.  being a human target is not a rap credential. lets just say i hope he dies trying.
0792846443|5.0|One of the best psychological thrillers ever made, &quot;Misery&quot; is a tride and true adaption of the classic Steven King bestseller, white - knuckle tale filled with suspense that only someone as brilliant as King himself could ever provide<br />Paul Sheldon (played flawlessly by James Caan) is the author of a very successful book series called &quot;Misery&quot;. But after years of success, he decides to kill the character once and for all and get on with his life. He finishes his book, but disaster strikes on his way back to New York. He gets caught in a snow storm and crashes his car. He is on the verge of death when a seemingly harmless nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates in an Oscar - winning role), who claims she's his number one fan. At first, Paul really enjoys Annie's company. Then Annie has several outbursts (including the now infamous ankle - breaking sequence), and Paul becomes suspicous of her past. From here on it's a tense battle between cat and mouse. And if you've never read the book before, then you're in for one of the creepiest endings in your life.<br />No movie fan should be without &quot;Misery&quot;. It is in a class of its own, different from other King classics like &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Cuju&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;. If those films didn't do it for you, then &quot;Misery&quot; will get your blood pumping, your palms sweating and your heart racing in no time.
6305311463|5.0|i liked this movie... i'd watch it over and over again... just so i can laugh and cry......
B00005JLK1|2.0|&quot;Ghost Ship&quot; is another grade B horror film that just isn't scary. Director Steve Beck is more interested in mood and showmanship, but unfortunately, he can't even get that right despite some spooky art direction and what looks to be a pretty big budget. And this isn't the first time that Beck has told a ghost story, he directed &quot;Thirteen Ghosts,&quot; which, in my opinion, is one of the better horror films in recent history.<br />&quot;Ghost Ship&quot; could have been fun had it gone in more interesting and unpredictable directions. Instead, we're treated to a fairly dull movie experience with one dimensional characters and very few scares. And it's all capped off by a sequel-ready ending complete with an obtrusive hard rock tune that offsets any sense of terror &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; might have had to offer.<br />In my opinion, this film should not be purchased. It is an okay rent, but make sure it a 99cent rent, as more would be a waste of your money.
B0000070QS|5.0|I have always enjoyed a-ha (because of Morten's voice more than anything else), but never quite guessed the depth of Morten's talent. This CD is better than anything I have ever heard before. The depth of voice and lyrics is just plain fantastic. Especially &quot;A Kind of Christmas Card&quot;, &quot;East Timor&quot; and &quot;Lay Me Down Tonight&quot;<br />It's a pity that he is unappreciated in north America and we have to consider this CD an &quot;import&quot;. And a greater pity that he doesn't come up with albums more frequenty.
B0000019PA|5.0|It blows my mind that &quot;Aeroplane&quot; is the 200th best selling CD on Amazon. Obviously pepole do have pretty good taste after all! It's comforting to know that Jeff Mangum's moving vision has grown into such a word-of-mouth classic. They say Brian Wilson gets up every morning and puts &quot;Be my baby&quot; on the record player. As for me, I put on &quot;In the aeroplane over the sea&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|This Book was great once I picked it up I could not put it down it had a good plot from beginning to end and everyone should by it I know that Christians are up in arms and are saying it is offensive being one myself I can say that it did not offend me in the least and was a great read.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This album is bomb.  Alicia has completely raised the bar for black women artists... actually all artists.  She has garnered so much attention for herself and her music without ever over-exposing herself.  The album is a true artistic masterpiece, yet it maintains that pop appeal.  She has been getting great reviews everywhere I have looked, and I just saw today that Hitcooper.com chose her as their new artist pick, which is huge for Alicia.  I would have to say my favorite song on the album is #6 - if i aint got you... but seriously the whole album is bomb.  I really hope the record labels see that us listeners want more artists like Alicia, and less of the artists who can't even write their own songs...
B00004WKII|5.0|The Jimi Hendrix bookset contains four CD's of all unreleased tracks spanning from 1967 to 1970. This is truely the best box set that was ever released including an 80 page booklet with many rare photos of hendrix live, and in the studio. Highlights from the first disc contain Unreleased Recordings like Purple Haze, Foxy lady, Highway Chile, Burning Of The Midnight Lamp, and Like A Rolling Stone Live at The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 18, 1967. Highlights from the disc two include Bold As Love, Sweet Angel, Fire Live at Clark University, Gypsy Eyes, and Gloria. The third disc gets into latter recordings of Hendrix including Stone Free, Spanish Castle Magic, Little Wing, Voodoo Chile(slight return) Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1969, and Izabella.<br />Highlights from the fourth disc include Freedom, Johnny B. Goode Live at Berkeley 1970, Blue Suede Shoes Live at Berkley 1970, Hey Baby/In From The Storm live at Maui, 1970. Ezy Rider very cool version, Night Bird Flying, All Along The Watchtower live at The Isle Of Wight 1970, and In From The Storm. And the last track is the last song Hendrix recorded in the studio titled Slow Blues very rare. This box set is truely an experience I love to listen expesically to the live performences where hendrix just gives you an truely amazing performence. The studio versions are even funner to listen to this box set is worth the money buy this and be experienced. Highly Recomended!
B00009V7OR|5.0|I still remember very vividly when my mom yelled &quot;Oh My God!&quot; when we watched the preview trailers for this movie around the time it was released. <br />Upon seeing it, I have to say that &quot;Independence Day&quot; is one of the greatest sci-fi action movies that I have ever seen. Seven years later (At the time of this review), this movie still packs a big punch. The story is of when a large and vicious alien race invade the earth through city-sized spacecraft and wage war against Earth's humanity and now the humans all stop fighting each other and join forces to destroy the alien ships and the aliens themselves before they destroy every major city on earth, suck out all of it's resources and move on to the next planet. <br />This is a truly magnificent movie. One of the best of 1996.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Merging folk and rock, Britain's Jethro Tull emerged on the music scene in the late sixties along with such progressive rock acts as The Yes & King Crimson (to name a few) and became known worldwide for their 1971 album \\"Aqualung\\" which propelled them to superstar status alongside the The Moody Blues, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. \\"Bursting Out\\" was recorded during various European concerts in 1978 and they cover early classics such as \\"A New Day Yesterday\\", \\"Sweet Dream\\", \\"Bouree\\", \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Locomotive Breath\\", \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\", \\"Thick As A Brick\\" to later songs such as \\"Jack In The Green\\", \\"Songs From The Wood\\", \\"Too Old To Rock N' Roll, Too Young To Die\\",\\"Minstral In The Gallery\\" and \\"No Lullaby\\" to name a few. Headed by the always colorful and never at a loss for words, flutist and lead singer Ian Anderson, does a superb job interracting with the audience. The interplay between his flute playing and guitarist Martin Barre's solos are outstanding and can best be heard on \\"Thick As A Brick\\". And enough can't be said of Barriemore Barlow who's drum solo at the end of \\"Conundrum\\" is nothing short of jaw dropping. This newly remastered version of \\"Bursting Out\\" is excellent with increased bass, midrange and crisp highs. If you enjoy classic rock from the seventies then you'll love this cd as it is one of the best \\"live\\" recorded concerts this reviewer has ever heard!
0671027344|4.0|It was great book, loved it. Me, not being the most outgoing of sorts, loved the book because it was about the stuff I never did but always wondered if I'd ever do. And Charlie was the most amazing character. I could never tell if he was shy or flamboyant. He cried often, was very sensitive, yet would smoke pot everyday. I wish I knew someone like him, he seemed amazing.<br />Only bad things about the book were the ramblings Charlie would get into. (i.e &quot;What A Wonderful Life&quot; speech....) It was nice, but a little sketchy around the edges.
B00005A46T|5.0|i really enjoy this cd. i admit this cd isnt the greatest. its definitley no tool or nine inch nails this isnt even marilyn manson(which is great) but its still a good cd the last part of my review is for the death metal kiddies who think they no what good music is compare these to lyrics by slipknot and a death metal band<BR>Slipknot:I know I know the faces that have disappeared in time <BR>Find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime <BR>All my friends have pictures made to make you cry <BR>I've seen this and wondered what I've done to <BR>Calcify<BR>Dimmu Borgir:Glowing eyes, staring eyes<BR>Manifest of evil presence<BR>With entities swept in disease and decay<BR>A fall from paradise beyond redemption(deep and insightful huh?)
B00003Q438|5.0|This beautifully directed 1989 treasure is a very slow yet engaging classic courtesy of James Cameron.<br />It takes place during the heights of the cold war when an American nuclear submarine crashes and goes down to the ocean floor along with several nuclear submarines near an Oil Rig and the Navy SEALS send a crew of divers down to the ocean to investigate and salvage the wreckage and retrieve the nuclear warheads that are still live but unarmed but they encounter two major problems. One is one of their crew is a traitor and is searching for the nukes to use against America while they also discover while down in the dark depths of the ocean that humanity may not be alone afterall.<br />This is a truly excellent movie and the visuals are amazing.
0394716787|4.0|There is only one flaw with this book, and it goes precisely against what Poe himself stated, which as that he found it inexcusable to print a person's work other than how he/she intended it.  Mark Twain's writings are a prime example of publisher's not honoring his wishes.  Poe is another victim.  This particular volume designates where the publisher has chosen to remove text because THEY felt it unnecessarily elongated the story.<br />There is a volume that does not do this, but I cannot recall the name.  If you don't mind the publisher deciding for you what of Poe's art you need to read, this volume is fine.  For me, I always want the author's work, not the publisher's.
B00000AFDW|1.0|i was listening to this and i noticed that this is a rip from a whole bunch od Insane Clown Posse cds, if u truly listen to ICP na dhtne listen to this cd you will notice that they are very similar and unfortunately for KISS, the songs that they related theirs to were out before this cd came out. I was not satisfied when i heard this cd!Juggalos stand tall!
0385504209|4.0|This book is a wonderful book for people of all ages to read.  It will open your eyes to a new way of thinking.  I believe it will change your life if you follow these rules closely and are prepared for your life to be better.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Yes, I liked this CD better than Britney's debut. I think this CD showcased Britney's talent a little bit better. Plus I enjoyed the songs on this CD better. <br />Oops...I Did it Again, like ...Baby One More Time, was an excellent first single for this CD. It's contagious, very fun, danceable, and a hit. The video was silly though. Except her dancing on that white star thing on her back! Stronger was one of my favorite songs off of this CD. I loved the sound, the background, and Britney's voice on it. Plus I really liked the video. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door was so-so, as was (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction. They aren't my favorites, but they aren't bad. I loved Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. You see a much more talented side of Britney and a very dramatic change from her ...Oops I Did It Again music and vocals. What U See (Is What U Get) was fun, once again, not one of my favorites, but still a decent song. Lucky was another of my favorites off of this CD. I think it really gives a good message that even if you're rich and famous you may still have a sad and lonely life, which is what Britney's life is like at times and people don't understand that. The last 5 songs I will admit I didn't listen to that much. One Kiss From You was decent, as were the rest, but they weren't as good as some of the better highlights of the CD. A very good try from Britney. Her CDs keep getting better.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|This music just does not do it for me.  It is not Dream Theater, and I am not sure what category it belongs in.  One reviewer said this is the album Metallica should have released, instead of &quot;St. Anger.&quot;  I am not entirely certain the both of them don't belong in the &quot;St. Trashcan.&quot;  It is one thing to have ability, as all of the members of this band do (TREMENDOUS ability), but another altogether different when you waste that ability on discombobulated noise and unconnected, unrelated passages that sound like you are simply going through the motions.  The music is technically competent, but very difficult to listen to.
B000001FS3|5.0|There is within music an ability to tap into the raw, revelatory power of beauty; music can give itself to the unknown whisper of the eternal in ways that other forms of art only hint at.  The collage of sounds communicates something deep to the heart and, when combined with the presence of the voice, can be downright liberating.  Few individuals, let alone bands, ever really reach a point where they are that open to the Unknown that it can give itself so freely through their music.  U2 has done so time and again, but never with the level of directness and sincerity as they accomplished on the Joshua Tree.<br />A joshua tree is a real tree that thrives despite the dry environment it lives in.  The image - the icon - of life amidst its seeming absence, embodied in the joshua tree, is one that is fully appropriate to U2 - particularly at the end of their first decade.  U2, like the joshua tree, stood in stark contrast to its environment: ascetic, prophetic and disarmingly (some would say &quot;naively&quot;, but let the tension stand) sincere.  (Their foray into the realm of post-modern sampling, irony and sarcasm was an identity crisis fully in line with where they stood in the 80s: cynicism is frustrated optimism.)<br />&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;, the second song, really expresses the kernel of The Joshua Tree; every other song fleshes it out in some way or another.  The album is, in the end, about distance: &quot;I have run, I have crawled, I have scaled these city walls only to be with you: But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.&quot;  While one may take this to be an admission of defeat - and distance whispers of despair as much as consummation - doing so is incorrect: &quot;I'm still running,&quot; Bono sings.  The song is an expression of hope more than anything.<br />Faith is a raw and disarmingly rough beauty; it looks within and it looks without.  &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;give full expression to U2's long-time political engagement, while &quot;With or Without You&quot; gives a glimpse into U2's more tender side.  &quot;With or Without You&quot; may very well be the best love song of the 80s.  &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, a deeply personal song about the death of a friend, moves with passion and rugged grace - and, again, with hope: &quot;I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky and the moon has turned red over one tree hill.&quot;<br />I look forward to the day when my children ask me, &quot;Dad, did you ever listen to U2?&quot;  Not only will I have stories to tell about live concerts, but I will be able to relive with them the goosebumps that certain songs will inevitably bring.  If rock is dead, U2 was its apex.  And U2 has yet to be eclipsed.
B000001EEN|5.0|I guess fans know about this CD, but I don't remember its re-release in a much expanded form getting nearly the attention it deserves.  In every respect, this is one of the most compelling live albums from the rock era, and it is a career peak for Eric Clapton.  Most all-star backing bands bump into each other on the way to the spotlight, but not this one.  For one night, celebrity pals like Pete Townsend, Ron Wood and Steve Winwood became clones of the Dominos, humbly backing Clapton so he can give us great renditions of &quot;Layla&quot; tunes like &quot;Layla,&quot; &quot;Bell Bottom Blues,&quot; &quot;Little Wing,&quot; and &quot;Tell the Truth.&quot;  The fierce Derek and the Dominos numbers come off best, but the whole thing sounds great to me.  You'd never know Clapton was coming off a despairing, drug-abusing, two-year layoff.  He sounds, vocally and at the guitar, in peak form.  You also get sort of a &quot;Blind Faith&quot; reunion, on &quot;Presence of the Lord,&quot; the best song from that group's only album, rendered here in a fine version. This album reminds you that the great stars of the 60s and 70s were appreciated above all for their tremendous abilities as musicians.  That's hardly the reigning aesthetic today, unfortunately.
B00005OM4N|3.0|This was a very good CD, and even though I didn't like it as much as Britney's two previous CDs, I am happy that at least Britney is putting more of herself into her Cds and not having all of her hits written by someone else. <br />Songs I enjoyed off of this CD:<br />I'm A Slave 4 U<BR>Lonely<BR>Overprotected<BR>I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman<BR>Boys<BR>I Love Rock 'n' Roll<BR>Cinderella<br />So I guess you can say I rate 1/2 of this CD as above average. But the rest of the CD wasn't that...unique. It kind of all blended together as a lot of the same kind of music and subjects. If you want the real Britney, get this CD. But I didn't like it as much as her older ones or 'In The Zone'.

B00005JMFQ|1.0|I loved notting hill, gave a lot to think about and everybody liked the ending.<BR>With this movie I was so disgusted with all the [profanity] it shows and no real interest in giving an uplifting view of what real love ought to be!<BR>We left the movie theater as soon as the sleezy part started with the bug-eyed english guy in the bar. I was begining to enjoy some of the other stories but why do you have to \\"porn it up\\"? <BR>We went to see this movie because of the excellent actors, to bad for them they have to be associated with this material.<BR>I really hope nobody buys this DVD so that hollywood sees that people are more interested in less ephimeral things.<BR>Go see the PASSION instead.
B00005B36H|5.0|there are many different ways to know a band. I have many times read things about Tool, but I really decided to give them a listen when I knew they were to collaborate with Skinny Puppy in the latter's forthcoming album. Then I discovered that Tool's drummer also played for NIN.<br />Most of the music I listen to and love is electronic. Tool isn't. But that isn't a drawback for me, I'm not prejudiced against guitar-based music, that eternal electronics vs guitars debate is or should be completely obsolete. But I do admit (that's just my opinion, my feelings, do no hate me for that) that most of guitar-based bands bore me. But Tool doesn't. Lateralus is a very good album, it's the only Tool album I've heard so I can't compare. I just call this good music. why?<br />First of all, the music is subtle. You may call it a metal band if u like; or you may say it's too bland to be labelled as that. doesn't matter to me. They're very good cos they're able to combine hardness and calmness in a extraordinarily subtle way. The songs in lateralus are quite long. And they lead us though many different passages: sometimes it's one full of hard guitar riffs, powerful basses and frenetic drums (tool's drummer deserves a special attention); then suddenly you're engulfed in a more atmospheric passage, with an acoustic guitar and some electronic touches, very few but subtle again, and the singer also accompanies these diferent moods: when he screams, he screams! but unlike many other singers, he's also able to sing melodically and even reminds me sometimes of Pink Floyd's Gillmour's way of singing. The drummer, as I've said, is really superb. I hadn't listened anything so good since Can's drummer. I especially love the way he plays the toms in various songs.<br />don't know if it's the best of the band. Just know it's a very very good album actually.
B00003CXCT|3.0|As the Alien Quadrilogy showed us, giving the fans a choice between two versions of each film is not hard. Why can't I see the movie I fell in love with in 1977? I don't mind it when they clean up the print and remove minor faults, but putting in CGI, just for the sake of using it, is not my cup of tea.(...) I like the Mona Lisa just the way she is, I don't particularly want to see her with a new hat and curly blonde hair. I hate it when they mess with things that are great the way they are.<BR>As far as I'm concerned, they can keep on changing SW as much as they like, but unless the original version is included, I'll just keep on watching my old video tape, thank you very much. Call me old-fashioned. I'm grateful for what George Lucas gave us back in 1977, it's the best movie ever in my book, but the SE definitely is not.
B00004TH83|5.0|Otherwise, we're stuck with another popstar wannabe like Derrick Lam!
B00005JMKI|3.0|I was extremely impressed with the way the director managed to paint a convincing picture of a small mountain community with nothing but a few lines on the floor and a handheld camera. The abstracted nature of the scenery really leaves room for imagination and gives you an experience that is closer to seeing a play (or even reading a book!) than the usual pre-fab cinema experience.<br />Unfortunately, this is not enough to redeem a film that is not only far too long, weighing in at a little over two hours and fifty minutes, but also often painfully slow and utterly predictable. Every minor point the film makers choose to make is spelled out multiple times, both in word and in action, and repeatedly hammered home in a fashion that lacks subtility of any kind, and leaves no room for interpretation. With a few notable exceptions, most scenes in the film are redundant and only serve to whack the viewer on the head on the off chance they didn't get the point already.<br />If someone steps up and does a 1h40 edit, this will be my new favourite film. Until then, it can go on the \\"interesting but flawed\\" pile.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I just watched this movie for the first time last night at 22 years of age and was amazed.  I like it even more thinking about it the next day.  Quite a stunning film about Ed Wood, who I was honestly unaware of in Hollywood history.  Great performances, great characters, story-line was generally good for a biography type piece.  <br />Okay, yes, Johnny Depp proved that he has acting abilities that no actor should be capable of having.  I could barely...barely, find an ounce of him in this part.  What is interesting is that you can still \\"see\\" Johnny when he takes on his roles like they ARE him, yet they aren't like him.  But essentially they really are him.  Difficult to explain this feeling but this movie truly made me see that.<br />Truly great performances by the other magnificent actors too.  Bill Murray held his natural sense-of-humor without acting like he has one, didn't even recognize Vincent D'Onofrio as Orsen Wells, and admired Bela aka Landeu's perfromance tremendously(sp?)
0743243153|5.0|It is one of the most powerful book I have ever read. It has the energy that can go through my deepest thought and soul and help me to finally understand many things in my life. It is amazingly easy to read for a book that presents you with abstract concepts and ideas. Having a bacground in psychology and have seen many pop psychology books that provide you with simplistic tools to fix your life, I am relieved that this book is not one of them. It does not give you steps to follow or quick fixes, but it gives you ability to make sense of your world and to see your life in a brighter way. It gives you growth! And it even encourages you to see yourself as a part of something bigger. It does not shy to mention God and faith as part of human growth! How refreshing!<BR>It is a real classic, a masterpiece, and I will not be surprised if the book is still relevant 20 or even 100 years from now.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I still can't over the fact that this is a Britney album every time I listen to it. Except Brave New girl, there is not a single song that really reminds the listeners that they are still listening to the girl who used to sport pigtails around a basketball court singing...??<BR>My favourites are Toxic, Breathe on me, Everytime, Shadow, Showdown, Touch of my hand and brave new girl. The other songs are pretty good and the remix of MATM is really great.

B00005PJ6M|4.0|There definitely has to be at least one more of Bill & Ted. Both are approaching 40, and their bank accounts may soon be running a little dry (that's a joke), so surely that's an excuse enough to make another! Please? I'm sure there are more Bill & Ted fans out there, it's just not me! Keanu & Alex have both said they'd work with each other again, and lets face it, Alex isn't exactly up to much recently. He's mainly doing behind the scenes stuff, and apparently has a wife and child, and is looking mighty fine for a guy approaching 40. Keanu is also a fairly small name in the movie business these days, you may have heard of the Matrix trilogy?<br />The first movie was a success. The second isn't as exciting, although it does have its moments, but it is still a totally bogus movie. All the old characters appear, the princesses, the dads, Missy, and some great new stars, William Sadler playing the Duke of Spook, the Doc of Shock, The Man with No Tan, Death himself, the Grim Reaper. He is terrific in this movie, moreso towards the end, where he comes out with a excellent line: \\"You might be a king or a little street sweeper, but sooner or later you'll dance with the reaper.\\" You've gotta love that line.<br />Not since Chasing Amy etc, has a movie come out with great end credits. (If you like the final song, you'll probably watch the credits right to the end, if you don't, you won't!) Here are some examples of what appears in the end credits to Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey:<br />\\"Be Excellent to Each Other and Party On.\\"<br />The Full On First Unit<br />The Stellar Cast<br />The Non-Heinous Second Unit<br />The Bodacious Video Effects<br />The Atypical Creature & Makeup Effects<br />The Unprecedented Video Photography<br />The New Age Dudes<br />Totally Outstanding Guitars Provided By<br />Camera Operator \\"Evil\\" Bill Roe<br />First Assistant Camera \\"Good\\" Bill Clevenger<br />I hope there will be a third Bill & Ted movie. The best bit of both movies has to be the newspaper/magazine covers towards the end. If you read the headlines, they're pure class! If you haven't seen these movies, you must. They're before Keanu really hit the big time, when all he could do was goofy (and sexy at the same time!), and when Alex really didn't look like he'd hit puberty yet!rds the end.

0440237688|4.0|I chose to read The Giver for a school project.  I finished it the day after I started it.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I had heard a lot of good things about it, but didn't know if it was all true.  I was happily surprised when I read it; it was as good as everyone said.<br />I am not a huge fan of science-fiction novels, but I loved The Giver.  This novel really made me think.  It makes one think of what we take for granted, such as seeing in color and listening to music.  I would recommend this book to nearly anyone.  It is a classic story that should make a lasting impression on anyone who reads it.

B000031XBQ|5.0|This was the first ABBA record I ever owned. Originally released in 1980, The LP originally titled \\"Gracias por la Musica\\" (\\"Thank You For The Music\\") featured some of ABBA's big hits (and a couple of lesser known songs) sung entirely in Spanish.<br /><br />I must say (being a latino) that the girls sing wonderfully in Spanish. The star vocalist on this album is Agnetha, since she sings a huge bulk of the songs and her vocal work is superb. I prefer the Spanish versions of \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Fernando\\", \\"Thank you for the Music\\" (\\"Gracias por la Musica\\") and \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\" (\\"Dame, Dame, Dame\\") over the original English versions. Main reason being is that the vocals and harmonies are far more clearer and pristine in these Spanish versions. Agnetha's voice sounds spotless in \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Gracias por la Musica\\", \\"Al Andar\\" (\\"Move On\\"), and \\" Dame, Dame, Dame\\". We get to hear the delicacy and texture of her gorgeous voice more here than on ABBA's other albums. And since the songs here are not as textured and overdubbed like their English counterparts, we get to hear the delightful harmonies in all of their ABBA-esque splendour. Just listen to the chorus in \\"Chiquitita\\" and \\"Al Andar\\" and you will see what I mean. The English versions sound bigger but the Spanish versions are crisper, less intense production-wise but far superior in vocal sound and texture. Frida also shines in \\"Fernando\\", \\"Estoy So&ntilde;ando\\" (\\"I Have a Dream\\") and \\"Conociendome, Conociendote\\" (\\"Knowing Me Knowing You\\").<br /><br />\\"Dancing Queen\\" (\\"La Reina Del Baile\\") is a draw as I can't really decide which version of the song I prefer, they both have pros and cons. Vocally the girls sound great in the Spanish version but the overall production is slightly inferior such as the piano. On this recording, the piano sounds more synthesized and doesn't have the charm of the original instrument. We also don't get that intense and embellished musical production of the original which I would have preferred here (as opposed to the solo pieces) because after all, this is more of an ensemble piece with both girls vocals at the forefront. \\"La Reina del Baile\\", production wise, sounds a bit watered down however the vocals here are still superb and Agnetha's high pitches are more emphasized here as well. The Spanish version is also a bit longer as the second verse is not edited. \\"Dancing Queen\\" is a great song in any language and the girls great voices and the timeless melody makes this one of the CD's highlights.<br /><br />Commercial wise, the LP, \\"Gracias por la Musica\\" was a world-wide hit- especially in Latin America and the first single taken off the album \\"Chiquitita\\" reached # 1 in Argentina, Mexico and my native Chile (at least according to the accompanying notes) among several other countries. The CD version retitled \\"ABBA ORO\\" contains 5 songs not included in the album originally- \\"Felicidad\\" (\\"Happy New Year\\"), \\"Andante Andante\\", \\"Se Me Esta Escapando\\" (\\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\"), \\"No Hay a Quien Culpar\\" (\\"When all is Said and Done\\") and \\"Ring Ring\\". I must warn anyone reading this review that it's the CD with the black covering of \\"ABBA ORO\\" that contains the bonus tracks not the gold colored one. I happened to stumble upon both of them at a store here in Toronto and I was able to purchase the 15 track \\"ABBA ORO\\" in black.<br /><br />And lastly, you don't need to know a word of Spanish to appreciate this CD. The melodies are timeless and the girls voices are spectacular. This needs to be right next to your \\"ABBA GOLD\\" CD. It is simply fant&aacute;stico.ere (as opposed to the solo pieces) because after all, this is more of an ensemble piece with both girls vocals at the forefront. \\"La Reina del Baile\\", production wise, sounds a bit watered down however the vocals here are still superb and Agnetha's high pitches are more emphasized here as well.

B00003CXCT|5.0|The only thing Im worried about is that Lucas is going to bring the original Star Wars trilogy to DVD without removing the horrible 'ghost matts' from around the ships that shows up during alot of the space battle scenes. It really ruins the look of the movie, and is very distracting. <br />Its pretty noticable in all 3 films, original and special editions, especially during the assault on the 2nd Deathstar by the rebel fleet in ROTJ. Big squares around all the ships that doesnt match the rest of space in the background. Uggg!!!!<br />With all the digital technology around nowadays, they MUST be able to fix it. It would surely be worth the effort right? Universal didnt clean up the matt problem on the Battlestar Galactica DVDs, and look how much that pissed people off. <br />(...)

0316921173|5.0|I just finished reading the most recent review of this novel (from 1999), a scathing piece of drivel by some self-important, overly-educated nitwit who pendantically lambasted a fellow reviewer's intellectual capacity and attention span for misspelling &quot;intelligent&quot;, when in the very same sentence he misspelled &quot;misspell&quot; (that's two s's, genius)... How's that for irony?<BR>     I read this novel about 8 years ago and I hold it fully accountable for changing the way I view fiction. It served as my introduction to Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce, Umberto Eco and Gabriel Garcia Marquez as well as a host of other authors who experiment with the structure of novels. Terrific piece of writing by an outstanding author whose work crackles with ideas.
B00008S2VG|5.0|At first listen, I was disappointed in this album. It's not what I had expected or hoped.   However, this album has grown on me like no other. It is a mature sound and not typical pop music.  Madonna may no longer rule the charts as she once did but her music continues to grow and mature along with her fans. This is a beautiful album that not everyone will appreciate.  Those of us who do, understand that there is room for more.  &quot;Radio stations always play the same songs&quot;
0440241413|5.0|I must admit, with no planning at all, I read the three books in the SHOPAHOLIC series in the reverse order from which these had been written. This reversal may be my good luck.<br />CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is cute, but it in no way forecasts how clever the later two books would be. If I only had read this first book, I might not have continued the series, and that would have been my loss.<br />As author Sophie Kinsella became more comfortable with her heroine, the stories became more complicated, more imaginative, and far more hilarious.<br />Still, the character of Becky Bloomwood is fully formed in this first novel, and she must be one of the most endearing heroines in recent history. If excessive shopping actually is an obsessive compulsive disorder, then poor Becky is afflicted.<br />Meanwhile, readers share Becky's world view--and her commensensical nonsense is a sheer delight. Logic that seems skewed at first begins to appear more grounded than conventional thinking. Becky is the contemporary English equivalent of the characters that the late Gracie Allen and Lucille Ball made so beloved on American television.<br />Read CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC. Read the entire series. These are charming books that will make you laugh, and this series will create fond memories that remain long after the novels have been returned to the shelf.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|I always thought that the producers of Dark Castle Entertainment would actually bring us some original horror entertainment but apart from the wonderful Halle Berry and Robert Downey Jr., this flick just ends up with same taste in your pallet as you got from Thirteen Ghosts or Ghost Ship.<br />Yes the locations, costumes, cinematography, lighting and set design are all on top form. The casting is done well. The first 30 minutes of this film will have you amused, maybe even scared at times as a psychiatrist (Berry) finds herself on the other side of the bars in an institution for the criminally insane with a somewhat overfriendly psychiatrist (Downey) probing her mind for reasons why she murdered her psychiatrist husband with an axe. Then the plot takes a turn and Berry starts to remember seeing ghosts before the murder and then the ghost appears for real and tries to help her escape and then the story just totally goes off the rails and becomes some sort of a twisted snuff film production murder mystery with missing women. Then the movie turns to total farce for a special effects grand finale as the murderer is unmasked in Scooby style and whatever may have been plausible is now well and truly just another direct-to-video story with some good acting and higher production values than what it really deserves.<br />Does this mean you should not watch it? To be honest you have seen a lot worse than Gothika and maybe it is worth a look for Berry alone but when all is said and done this is still a poor movie with MTV production values. The bottom line is that Gothika is all special effects driven with a terrible third rate story that is more apt for television and not a movie. Berry looks great and does wonders but is wasted by a nonsense script. This is yet another nail in Dark Castle's coffin.
B00005JMSE|3.0|HELLBOY was a phenominal movie. From the opening scene, one of the best opening scenes to any action movie to date, it introduces you to the highly dangerous villains in the movie and introduces you to the things to be expected in the next 2 hours.<br />Visually, Hellboy is amazing. The moment that the movie introduces Abe Sapien, you realize you're watching something groundbreaking.  His character design is so realistic, it is breathtaking. The makeup department needs to be WORSHIPED... oh, by the way... RICK BAKER mean anything to you..? Yeah.<br />Ron Perlman was fantastic as Hellboy. Excellent casting.<br />Lets not forget one of the coolest villains ever. Kroenen is an assassin who had been studying the Occult and the black arts longs before WWII, becomes a Nazi. Kroenen is a master with the swords. He is also experiencing unnaturally long life, hench his decaying features that he must cover with multiple masks and shields.<br />This movie is phenominal action and visuals, but one thing pains me. As good as this movie was. As cool as this movie was. One thing made me change from 5 stars to 3 stars...<br />The ending was just plain dull. As good as the first 4/5 of the movie was, the ending seemed second rate and made me forget how great the rest of the movie was.<br />I loved the movie, I just wish the ENDING were HALF as good as the BEGINNING.
B000089RVX|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm a heavy metal fan as well as a practicing philosopher. I love Neo-Platonism and Bruce Dickinson's &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; album is my favorite. So when I first heard Evanescence's &quot;Going Under&quot; on the radio I thought: wow a woman that can sing along to heavy grooves. I poundered whether or not to buy another Neo-Platonism philosophy book or this CD. Well, I got the CD and just finished listening to it three times through. All I can say is is that Amy Lee is unbelievably talented. I'm shocked because I'm a completely esoteric metal fan. Whether it's Dream Theater, Bruce Dickinson, Rush, Paradise Lost, Iron Maiden, I seldom listen to female musicians. What God smacks me is that I like every song on FALLEN. That never happens when I buy a CD. Amy Lee has a voice like James Labrie from Dream Theater. It transcends the lyrics and the music itself. She puts the idealist's spirit in a trance-like state, because she has the ability to reach up out of the practical intellect into the speculative intellect, which is very rare for a woman to do--transcending the senses and matter. She touches on concepts in intuitive cognition and abstractive cognition (i.e., first and second intentions in medieval suppositio theory). The album is very spiritual as well, as the title FALLEN clearly defines. Amy Lee falls from Grace on this album, but her spirit definately soars with the enchanting sighs of her breath. I highly recommend this disk. It earns 5 stars on its merits from a philosophical skeptic.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|absolutely un F#!*ing believable. Yes there are hints of radiohead but who cares, thats an unbelievable compliment if you're being compared to radiohead.

B00005R24K|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made. Some people don't like it because of it's primitive style and bad acting but those people are missing the entire point. Raimi didn't make this film to win an Oscar. In this film lie some of the most creative and gory sequences of all time(pencils being stabbed through ankles and Campbell hacking up zombies with axes are two great examples). And unlike it's two comedic sequels, The Evil Dead is a serious horror movie.Five stars. Buy it!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I don't know why,but many people said that this album wasn't as good as her pervious releases,maybe it's not Madonna's best,I didn't think it's a bad work.<BR>I couldn't find a reason to say it wasn't good enough.the music,just the music,take away anything else,was so wonderful and Madonna sang something new.I alway could find that there would be something new in Madonna's songs.n' of couse something remains,and keeps on going.<BR>I can't wait to hear Madonna's next CD.3 years,that's not soon,but worth!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Intense all the way from &quot;Angel of Death&quot; to &quot;Raining Blood&quot; Twenty-Eight minutes of pure insanity. If you like Metallica's Master of Puppets but consider the songs too long and boring then pick this up. 5 Stars. Buy it NOW!
B00005N9CV|1.0|It is sitting in my cd rack but it was not my idea to buy this album.  I do not understand why artists that cannot come out with their own songs have such a great success.  At least, if she would have done those songs in a diffent style than the original songs, it would be a little more interesting and creative. Imagine a country version of \\"The look of love\\", or the opposite, a jazz version of \\"Sweet dreams are made of this\\".<br />I find women have a lack of imagination in music.  Singing is the big thing for them and that's about it.  When they touch an instrument, they don't want to reinvent music and limit themselves in few styles.  Sexy and good looking is another big thing that I would trade easily for woman with charisma.  Would they venture to be part of a band instead of being the sole member?<br />Stupid as it is, I have a pair of shoes that I call my Diana Krall's shoes, as if she was nothing else than a pair of legs on top of high heels.<br />(...)
B000002H33|5.0|Battery: Thrash insanity;good way to open up the album. One of   my personal faves.<br />Master of Puppets: An epic! Awesome riffs, solos and lyrics. A tad lengthy but hey: It still rules<br />The Thing that Should Not Be: My least favorite on the album, but still a great song. Kind of has that sludgy old-school Sabbath feel.<br />Welcome Home(Sanitarium): A great ballad. Changes things up a bit. One of my all time favorite 'Tallica songs.<br />Disposable Heroes: Same as 'Puppets. A little lengthy but still great.<br />Leper Messiah: Slows things up a bit but retains it's heaviness. A taste of the years to come.<br />Orion: Metallica's best instrumental ever. And that's aying something.<br />Damage,Inc.: Heaviest on the album( or any other Metallica album for that matter) and one of the best.Great way to close it.<br />Puppets is by far the best album of all time. If you don't like it, you cannot call yourself a metal fan. METALLICA!!!
0062502182|1.0|This is the sort of rubbish one wonders how it ever got published let alone sold two million copies. It is, I almost said literature there, lets call it prose, for the intellectually incapable and uneducated. The pseudo religious overtones are an insult to any intelligent human being. The plot is weak, condescening, irrelevant and egotistical. Do not waste your money.
B000003TA4|5.0|this is the CD that ignited the grunge punk rock revolution!!! Curt started it all by wearing flanel and being sad. But nevermind, his teen spirit lives on in this CD. I remember the day I bought it, wearing a def Lepard t shirt, the day after, I ripped it up and bought some fanel and doc martins which I still own. <BR>The other day, I remembered it was the day the Curt died. I had just gotten home from my job at the bank. I threw my suit off, put on those old dockers and once again flew my flanel and I listened to Teen Spirit once again. <BR>Do I care that you are reading this?<BR>Nevermind!!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm really not sure I want to purchase these DVDs. Everyone needs to own them if they've ever liked the series, of course. The movies are instant classics for adults and children alike. But I'm just not convinced I want to buy these, as they are not the pure, original theatrical versions. Instead, they are the blashemed \\"Special Edition\\" versions released a few years ago on VHS. The Special Editions changed a lot of fundamentals of the trilogy. The worst crime is changing the famous showdown in the bar between the rugged Han Solo and Greedo the bounty hunter; Lucas felt it made Solo too much of a bad guy to have him shoot Greedo first, so a badly re-edited version was put in the Special Edition where Greedo shoots first. Not only does it look horrible, it changes the essence of one of the best characters. This is where my conflict brews: should I purchase this edition or boycott it until Lucas puts the original, classic versions out on DVD?
0062502182|5.0|I first read this novel in English and loved it so much that I bought and read it in Spanish as well.  It is equally good if not better for you bilingual readers out there.  It has been 4 years now and I still think about how great this book was.  Definitely worth the read!
0394721772|5.0|Rarely are we able to say with certainty that a book is at the top of its subject in regard and quality. This book, the continuation of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child and Simone Beck is certainly in that most unique position among cookbooks written in English and published in the United States.<br />This volume is truly a simple extension of the material in the original work, which was recently published in a 40th anniversary edition by its publisher, Alfred E. Knopf and its principle author, Julia Child. As told in Ms. Child's autobiography, the original manuscript brought to Judith Jones at Knopf ran to over a thousand printed pages. About two fifths of that material was put to the side and most of it appears in this second volume. All this means is that you are unlikely to really have a full coverage of the subject of French Cooking as intended by the authors unless you have both volumes.<br />The first chapter has a clear sign that this volume rounds out the work in that it gives soups a much more thorough coverage than the first volume. Most importantly, it includes recipes for that quintessential French dish, bouillabaisse. To complement this subject is coverage of seafood such as a tour of the anatomy of a lobster that would put seafood specialist cookbooks to shame.<br />The biggest single addition to the subject in this book is its coverage of baking and pastry. Here is one place where the book may be seen to diverge from its focus of the French housewife's cooking practice. As the book states clearly in the first chapter, practically no baking is done at home, since there is a Boulangerie on every street corner. I generally find the level of detail on baking in cookbooks specializing on savory dishes to be much too light to give the reader an adequate appreciation of the subject. This book covers baking with a level of detail which would make most baking book authors blush. A sign of this deep, quality coverage is the diagrams used to illustrate baking techniques. The line drawings typically succeed where photographs do not in that they can be easily incorporated into the text and the drawing can eliminate extraneous detail and show the reader only what is important in understanding the technique. The section on making classic French bread ends with a `self-criticism' section we may nowadays call a debugging section. It lists several different things that may go wrong with your product, and how to fix them. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in only baking, let alone the rest of us.<br />The quality of presentation continues with the coverage of pastry. Some books on pastry give one pie dough. Some good books on pastry may give three or four. This book gives eight, with a clear indication of the differences in when to use the various doughs. Some books on pastry describe how to make puff pastry. This book gives a really complete explanation, with abundant diagrams. I suspect that very few people want to make their own puff pastry, but anyone who uses store-bought pastry will benefit from knowing how it is made. This section is worth five different expositions on the subject on the Food Network rolled into one.<br />Another major subject untouched in the original volume is the long chapter on Charcuterie. That is, the techniques needed to make sausages, salted pork and goose, pates, and terrines. Like the description of puff pastry, this chapter contains a lot you may never need, but then again, I am a great believer in serendipity. You never know where you may hit upon an idea to add interest to you cooking practice. The simplest product you can garner from these techniques is the method for making breakfast sausage, which needs no casing. The subject really wakes up when you realize that the subject arose as a method for preserving meats, just like canning and pickling were developed to preserve fruits and vegetables. If economy and the old hippie / whole earth catalogue ethic areyour thing, this is something you will want to check out. And, I have seen this subject covered in recent books such as Paul Bertolli's `Cooking by Hand', and this book's coverage of the material is more useful.<br />Another gem in this book is the coverage of desserts, including frozen desserts, custards, shortcake, meringue, charlottes, and on and on and on. The guidance on novel uses of puff pastry has probably been a source for more TV shows on the subject than you can count on your fingers. The recipe for leftover pastry dough is just another indication of how practical the material in this book can be.<br />The appendices contain `stuff' that virtually no other cookbooks touch. One contains a cross listing of recipes for meat and vegetable stuffings. I did not have enough room in my review of volume one to cite the quality of the material on kitchen equipment. As both books have been updated several times since the early sixties, both contain modern tools such as the food processor and the latest heavy-duty mixer attachments. Aside from being as complete a catalogue of hand tools I have ever seen, I find the presentation done with the kind of good humor which was the hallmark of Julia Child's PBS shows.<br />The last major feature of this volume is a two-color index that covers both volumes. Please be warned. These books have neither simple cooking nor low calorie dishes. The object of this style of cooking was to make the very best of inexpensive ingredients.<br />Each page offers more reasons to be impressed by this work. Any true foodie should be ashamed if they do not own and read these volumes.your thing, this is something you will want to check out.

0061015725|2.0|As usual Michael Crichton has his usual concept - a bio-technologically engineered invention that goes haywire.<br />Unfortunately, the story goes haywire too.  Jack Forman, recently unemployed stay-at-home Dad, starts observing that his wife, Julia not only has begun working long hours at top-secret research labs at Xymos Labs, but is also acting quite strange.  He assumes that she is having an affair.  It would be normal to expect the least Jack would do, was atleast try talk to Julia - but instead he is busy reviewing worst-case scenarios of divorce and probable custody battles.<br />Things begin to unravel beyond this point.  The product that Julia has been working with is a swarm of microscopic machines, that co-incidentally use a program called &quot;Predprey&quot; that Jack had developed.  Now Jack is called in to help deal with a runaway swarm that reproduces rapidly and seems intent on attacking Xymos Labs.  Ofcourse, he is never told the entire truth.  The rest of the story is about how Jack tackles this menace.<br />To give Crichton due credit, he does a good job of making the swarm a deadly, dangerous enemy.  But most of the story is totally insipid and cliched.  Some of the events and incidents in the book are so far-fetched that all the fancy technobabble Crichton uses, defeats the purpose.<br />I suggest Crichton focuses on books like Airframe.
0385504209|3.0|Just finished &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot; It was fun for what it was - a romp through history. However, if you're interested in rollicking reads based on Grail lore, try Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum.&quot; As I read &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; I kept in thinking that it was a dumbed-down version of Eco's book. The parallels are interesting; Paris, Knights Templer, Sofia . . .<br />That said, Brown's book is a fun read. If you're new to Grail lore it's a pleasant introduction. If you're a humourless hyper-Christian, stay away.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|What a great movie. I just got it in the mail today and planned to pop it in for just a minute to see what it looked like. I ended up mesmerized and watching it straight through -- after working a 12 hour day today! At first, I was not sure if I'd like this movie enough to buy it because some people reviewing here kind of said the plot might be thin or confusing. I was thinking maybe it would just be eye candy, but I like Daft Punk and I do like animation, so I thought I'd try it.<br />After watching Interstella 5555 tonight, I'd say there was only one point I got lost in the plot a little bit. The animation is very cool, but more than that, it is a very positive movie with very sympathetic characters. The characters are musicians who are kidnapped by this guy who is just aiming to increase his own power and is exploiting both them and their fans to get it. He writes over their memories,  changes their skin color and their clothes, and takes them to his own faraway planet. They can still play music people like, but you can see in their eyes that they have no spirit left in them when they don't know who they are anymore. I won't spoil the plot too much, but I think that is the greatest strength of this movie is that it is affirming to the human spirit and has a good deal of faith in the human spirit all in all. And in addition to the lofty things, it has great music and fashions! <br />For me, it builds on the aesthetic of all the rainbows and disco dreams that fascinated me when I was a 10-year-old roller skating kid in the 1980s--bright colors, magical scenes, sparkling shimmers. In contrast to the adult 80s which have the rep for being a decadent self-absorbed time, for me this draws on the experience of kids from the 1980s, which was influenced by that adult scene, but had its own different experience dealing with that culture from the perspective of relative innocence. The movie has a reflective stance that maybe integrates those experiences. It says you are sexiest and most vibrant when you are yourself, know what you stand for, and do what's right. And it charms me how it also hearkens back to what was magic to me in my childhood.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I normally don't do this but after reading these reviews I felt I have something to say.  I feel I need to defend Matthew Bellamy because he is not just a Thom Yorke spin-off (and Muse are not simply Radiohead clones as they have been accused of).  I'm not saying Matt hasn't studied him, thats obvious.  Matt has taken elements from Yorke and others (Freddy Mercury) and molded his voice to be one of the most haunting and elevating voices in rock.  The music itself has also taken some heat for sounding like Radiohead.  First, try to find a band (a UK band especially)post-The Bends that hasn't been influenced by Radiohead in some way.   And Second...NO!  With much respect to Radiohead, they could never rock as hard as Muse.  <BR>That said, Absolution is another solid, rockin' album from Muse.  Having been a fan since Showbiz, and making countless Muse fans out of almost all of my friends and their friends, it's great to see that they are still keeping it fresh and not slowing down.  Thank you Muse, and I'll see you on April 23rd!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Not only is the story incredible, with so many twists and suprises, but it's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and never get bored with.  Ewen McGregor gives a stunning performance as Edward Bloom and the watcher is drawn in by his charisma.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you'll always be hopeful.  Tim Burton's Big Fish is definently a must-buy.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|Honey is the best movie i have seen in a while it is inspiring esspecally to a dancer. It has a list stars like jessica alba and lil romeo who are AWESOME in it. I recommend this movie to anyone at all. If you are a hih hop dancer then you should definatly see it it will inspire you more then any other dance movie.
0783225792|5.0|What a great movie to watch with a few friends. I say that this is Pesci at his finest because he plays his role to finest. He is suppost to be the 'muscle' and protection of who Robert De Niro plays. I'm not going to get into roles and plot because there are 199 more reviews to find taht so I'd just be waisting my time. Most people say that Joe Pesci's part was disturbing and to violent...HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT!!! Some people just don't get the fact that he has been notorious for playing the psycho in the mob movies. Like in Goodfellas, he was supposed to be crazy in that one as well, but some people ignore that and criticize his role. DeNiro is so good in this film, but I say second best, because I think that 'The Mission' was his finnest piece of work. Another recconmended movie with a wonderful cast including Jeremy Irons. I think that you really can't compare this to Good fellas though because they are both true stories, and they both have..well prety close to  anyway, the same cast. If not buy, I'd say rent, and if not rent, I'd say buy, so either way, watch this movie. I'm actually doing this to put the review count up to 200 because 199 just looked kinda odd. Also, I encourage people to listen to Amadan and say taht this review was helpful.
B0001LJCMK|2.0|Josh Homme doesn't stand behind his work.<BR>He claims he never wanted Kyuss to get big, but only AFTER they failed to GET big. If Eagles Of Death Metal takes off, he will take all the credit (and the $). If they fade away, then he was  just the drummer and it was all just a joke.<BR>If you want to keep your \\"QOTSA and all that is related\\" cd collection up to date, this is a must buy.<BR> If you worship Josh Homme and the toilets he craps in, this is a must buy. <BR> Other than that, (...) Carlo Von Sexron, Baby Duck, or whoever....Jesse \\"The Devil\\" Hughes has some seriously haunting demos out there, but \\"Peace Love and Death Metal\\" fails to capture that essence and instead falls way short on a pop level, comparable to 'Jet' or 'White Stripes'.<BR> There are some white trash blues riffs in Keith Richards tuning, some lyrics about speed, dancing sluts, the So.Cal desert. All the \\"cool\\" people are involved, including the recently ousted Nick from QOTSA, Brody Armstrong of The Distillers, and other \\"desert folk\\". It was interesting in the 90's, but who cares 2004?     <BR> There are moments, like \\"Already Died\\", a hunting tune featuring Nick Oliveri on bass and a sampled drum track that sounds better than Homme playing live.
1881273156|5.0|Being an author and romance/relationship coach I'm always on the look out for good relationship books to read and recommend to others.  I highly recommend Dr. Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages for its clear concise strategy to embrace and accommodate the subtle and in some cases radical differences in how we all perceive love. <br />Dr. Chapman takes the myriad ways to show someone you love them and arranges them into five easy to understand and apply categories he calls Love Languages.  One or more of these Five Love Languages will speak directly to your heart and the heart of your loved one. You will learn quickly and easily how to evaluate your mate and discover exactly what kind of things you can do that say, \\"I love you\\" every time. <br />No more guessing or wondering what to do, how to do it or why.  When you know your mates primary love language you will be able to send a message of love to him or her as often as you like.  I've always paid very close attention to detail when doing anything romantic, thoughtful or loving for my wife.  I was both happy and proud to find Dr. Chapman's five love languages, Quality Time, Word of Affirmation, Gifts, Acts of Service and Physical Touch already incorporated into my marriage.   <br />My wife and I have been together for a little over five years now.  Even prior to reading The Five Love Languages every one of our years together has been blessed full of love, romance, passion, willingness, understanding and commitment.  There is know doubt about it, my wife and I have always spoken to each other in our primary love language and it works like magic.  I guess that's what has kept us speaking to each other (in tongues) all these years.  <br />My wife and I are proof that speaking to your mate in his or her love language can certainly rev-up your relationship and keep your marriage headed for victory lane.  Before love all of a sudden seems Greek to you, get yourself a copy of The Five Love Languages today.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|After the previews, I was ready to really enjoy the movie. The premise, though getting a bit old, still appeals to me. I got tired of Kate Beckinscale bursting through doors (even when it wasn't really called for). The acting was not good....very wooden surprisingly. I got the impression that she was trying to project her idea of what macho should look like. <br />If you are looking for a saturday night movie for background noise while you enjoy a night with friends, this is great. Otherwise.....
0790729652|4.0|&quot;Batman&quot; set the standard for all comic-to-screen heroes that came after it.  It's a good movie that shows you just how twisted and complex &quot;Batman&quot; really is.  He's not played out as some good guy without a care in the world, he's portrayed as a  vengeful, scared and somewhat chemically-imbalanced human being who just happens to be loaded and has a collection of &quot;wonderful toys.&quot;  In other words, Keaton plays the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; as human as a guy in a batsuit can be.  Although everyone talks about Nicholson, Keaton is the real treat here because he pulls off a character that no one really thought he could portray.<br />Don't get me wrong, Nicholson is wickedly funny as our favorite villain, &quot;Joker.&quot;  He's a total jerk with a screw loose(not unlike our hero) who's hellbent on making everyone &quot;happy.&quot;  He is the glue that keeps this story together.  He's also the reason most folks who don't read comics went to the theater to check this movie out.<br />The special effects are excellent for the time period, and the supporting cast is good as well.  Kim Basinger is nice to look at, but she is probably the least convincing character in this film.  As other reviewers stated, the story is a little uneven, but it's made up for with the brilliant belltower climax.<br />In closing, &quot;Batman&quot; is what all superhero flicks should be:  1) True to the original concept of the characters(Manipulating 'Penguin' in the second flick was immoral) 2) Has an interesting storyline(unlike every sequel) 3) Good special effects that don't come off too cheesy(ref. every sequel) 4) A real cast that's actually interested in the story(no George Clooney) 5) And completely void of multiple arch-villains(Why did every movie after this one include two baddies versus &quot;Batman&quot; anyway?)<br />Enjoy this flick, and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy &quot;Daredevil&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; flicks as well.  They are just as dark and brooding.ust as dark and brooding.
0380973650|4.0|In America the land was the church.  The land was the religion.  The land was older and wiser than the people who walked on it.  According to this book, America didn't have inhabitants to begin with.  They all traveled here from somewhere else, and when they came here they brought with them their own gods in their minds.  Each god that was brought to America was smaller than their counterpart left back in the homeland they came from.  The people who brought them here then became acclimated into the new land and for the most part either stopped believing and worshiping these lesser gods, or they didn't pass their beliefs down to their decedents, so they in turn didn't believe.  This made the gods weak.  Then if it got to the point that no one believed in these gods anymore then they became forgotten and died.<br />In America, all of these lesser gods for the most part look like regular people or animals.  They are con artists, drug addicts, prostitutes, cap drivers, and undertakers.  Most of them are old.  Occasionally Shadow the main character gets to see what they really look like and interacts with them.<br />Shadow is an ex-con who is hired to work as a kind of bodyguard for one of the gods named Wednesday.  Mr. Wednesday is also known by many other names.  A war is brewing between the old gods and the new gods since they believe there isn't enough worship to go around to keep them all going.  It then becomes a mystery as to why Shadow has become such an important part in the whole scheme of things leading up to the war.<br />Shadow travels with Wednesday though America to try to recruit other gods to fight for their side in the upcoming war.  At times Shadow becomes a kind of Jesus like figure (but not Jesus), and there are many comparisons you could make between them in this book.  For the most part Neil Gaiman seems to stay away from religions such as Catholicism and Judaism, and just focuses on the gods themselves.  Many of these lesser gods I had never heard of before, and it gave me an excuse to go out on the web and read their stories and learn about some interesting beliefs and legends.  I wish I had known a little more about the Norse gods before reading this book.  Some of the gods I learned a lot about were Odin, Loki, and Baldor.  The other main characters in the book, Czernobog, Mr. Nancy, Mr. Jackal, Mr. Iblis, Whisky Jack, and Easter were also very entertaining.  I also liked the character of Shadow's wife Laura a lot as well.<br />At times this book reminded me of the book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; when Shadow and Wednesday start taking road trips to small parts of America to meet up with these different gods.  In &quot;Zen...&quot; the main character is on a trip through the heartland of America as well, and also keeps having dreams, in which he is soul searching to try to find himself.<br />One of the towns they stay in is Lakeside which is a very nice town right out of the Twilight Zone with a mystery of it's own, and a nice side theme.<br />I was also reminded a bit of the movie &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, but instead of seeing ghosts everywhere, Shadow sees gods.<br />The only detraction I can think of in this book was that some of the individual stories of how each god came to America was a little bit of a distraction, but Gaiman ties them all back in later in the book as having some necessary relevance to the story.<br /><br />In the end you are waiting for everything to become perfectly clear and for them to spell it all out for you, but Gaiman doesn't do that.  You have to do that for yourself, and a lot of it might still be left to interpretation.<br />It was a very good book none the less.

B00005JM0B|4.0|Rise of the Machines was just as much fun to watch as the first two. The Governator had a machine gun and he was shooting it. Plus his face was practically ripped off leaving only his metalic skull showing. What more do you want? T3 had intense robot battles and lots of high tech special effects. I myself am not too big on tons and tons of computer generated images. The CGI and the fact that the movie was a bit slow at times lead to me giving it a 4 out 5. But the fights are awesome and the intensity is high. I think Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines fits nicely with the other two and I am hoping for a T4. Plus the ending rocks!
B000000OUJ|5.0|This could arguably be the best Wu-Tang solo album.  Once again, the RZA lays down his amazing beats for his fellow Clan-mate to glide over.  The GZA, who is probably the Clan's most gifted MC, drops jewels throughout this album (peep &quot;Labels&quot;).  This is my second favorite Wu-Tang album behind &quot;Only built 4 Cuban Linx&quot;.  Also, his second Wu album was O.K., but the &quot;Legend of The Liquid Sword&quot; is hot too.  As far as this CD goes, certified classic.
B00008S2VG|4.0|American Life can be described as Madonna's attempt to bring her views on religion, war, American Popular Culture, and fame, into the greater view of the world. While not Madge's strongest lyrical or VOCAL endeavor, we must still give some praise to the album simply for being Madonna's work. The singles, none of which did too well on the charts in the country of the album's namesake, have been praised and reached chart topping positions in other nations, partly due to the fact that the rest of the world holds their views on American Culture in sympathy with Madonna (basically a mockery of our culture). The lyrics do not transcend any emotional boudaries like those on other albums (i.e Ray of Light, Like a Prayer, True Blue), nor are there very many catchy tunes or hooks like other albums (i.e Music, anything from the Immaculate Collection). Madonna's once powerful, soulful, rock and roll voice which peaked during the late Eighties has now deteriorated into an off key, pseudo-Sheryl Crow voice. Contrary to popular belief, Madonna was indeed once a talented vocalist with a rich, almost African-American range(at times reminiscent of Ronnie Spector). This album's vocal performance could be due to one of two things: lack of effort, or simply a stressed throat. The songs themselves show none of the instrumental effort of others, as well, and the lone guitar does not fit the Madonna persona, unlike synthesizers, electric guitars, drums, and keyboards. Also, the album seems to have conflicting themes, being those of Anti-War protest, personal growth, the emptiness of fame, or the illusions of fame, as well as a few poorly written love songs. However, I must give some support to the Queen of Pop, who her fans must honor in any situation, even if it is a frowned upon album. Madonna, I assume, will return once again with the same effort, sexuality, risks, vocal talent and chart topping hits that brought her Icon status to her in the past. Simply look at the musical and lyricalhorror that was Erotica in 1992, and then observe the musical talent on later albums of the decade. Madonna will never be defeated. She is a Queen who cannot be dethroned.
0684800713|4.0|hemingway's clear, concise, staccato writing style make this a quick and enjoyable read. <br />the story of a number of expatriots who drink, travel, fish, and copulate--pretty much in that order--starts in paris and finishes in madrid, spain with a long stop at the fiesta at pamploma and the infamous running with the bulls. the female charcter, brett, is way ahead of her time. she like all the characters feels the frustration of an unfulfilled life. the following exchange between herself and the narrator (jake) expresses it well<br />&quot;it's sort of what we have instead of God&quot; (brett)<BR>&quot;some people have God,&quot; i (jake) said. &quot;quite a lot&quot;<BR>&quot;He never worked very well with me.&quot;<BR>&quot;should we have another martini?&quot;<br />this lost greneration differs from kerouac's road warriors in that they have money and they have stopped searching. exactly what brought them to this is never clear. like the cause of the narrator's impotency, it is simply the war.<br />the closing exchange between jake and brett crystalizes their perspective on life:<br />&quot;oh jake, we could have had such a damned good time together.&quot;<BR>&quot;yes. isn't it pretty to think so?&quot;<br />this book is worth reading to see one of america's great writers at his best.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|The original version as compiled, edited, salvaged and produced by Phil Spector, with taste and majesty, is light years beyond this feeble offering.  As a die hard Beatle fan, I don't say this lightly.
B00005JMX4|4.0|Emile Hirsch plays Matthew, an 18 year-old who's about to graduate high school with nothing \\"off the hook\\" to show for it. <br />Elisha Cuthbert plays Danielle, the beautiful blonde that moves in to house-sit next door to Matthew's house. <br />Without giving away too much of the plot, Matthew tries to lose his inhibitions as Danielle is trying to lose her previous identity as an adult film actress. <br />Most teen angst movies tend to be a bit humdrum but this one takes it up a few notches.. yes, mainly because of the gratuitous nudity in it.. but it's a good thing.. really.  :) <br />For a movie that has mostly new actors in it, Luke Greenfield does an excellent job with it.  The only problem I have with it is that Luke must have seen the movie 'Risky Business' one too many times because certain parts reek of the Tom Cruise favorite.  Luke even uses some Tangerine Dream-style music and Muddy Waters' \\"Mannish Boy\\" in the soundtrack.  This is why I gave it four stars instead of five. <br />For those adult film fans out there, Kobe Tai plays one of the prom dates.  Wow!  Who knew she could really act with her clothes ON?  ;)  Dasha and Kira Kener have about a split second cameo, but those was about the only others I recognized. <br />Movie Warnings: profanity, nudity (by male and female.. I didn't think Emile was old enough to have that much body hair), carseat mini-fight, dream sequences that may throw you off, and it may cause possible bad high school flashbacks. <br />For those comfortable with a number of sexy scenes in their comedies, I would highly recommend seeing this movie; however, I do not recommend this for kids or teens.. definite \\"R\\" movie. <br />(...)
B00005JMTN|5.0|Take The Wizard of Oz and mix it up with Forrest Gump and you have Big Fish.  Tim Burton has made yet another film classic.  Take all his previous films (Batman, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands) and turn them all upside down.  This film had almost no dark scary places, and hardly no dark colors.  This Tim Burton film was like a burst of all the colors of the rainbow.  The effects, the acting, the score, and the cinematography were all superb.  Alongside Ewan McGreggor, Jessica Lange, Albert Finney, and Billy Crudup, stand an awesome supporting cast including:  Allison Lohman, Steve Bushemi, Helena Bonham Carter, and the always awesome Danny Devito.  This film is for everyone to see.  Go be taken away by Big Fish.
B000001EL7|5.0|Fan's of &quot;Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; certainly welcomed and  treasured 1977's &quot;Love Gun&quot;. An album which equals &quot;Destroyer&quot; in it's comic art-based atmosphere and theme but  sounds more like &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; and includes similar lyrical structures. Metal rockers Ted Nugent and Alice Cooper by this point already had their inflential impact on Kiss, though neither could keep their success going so far into the decade.<br />The Title Track simply rocks. The thrashing drums keep it paced and driving.<br />&quot;Almost Human&quot; is a deep moody track with great vocals by Gene Simmons.<br />&quot;Shock Me&quot; is a prime example that Ace Frehley had relevance in the band as a singer.<br />Now it's reasonable to say, by no means was Kiss finished as a band in 1977, but they never had re-captivated the magic of their orignal lineup again till 96's Psycho Circus.
B00005JMGL|4.0|Branching off from it's predecessors (Hook, and Walt Disney's Peter Pan) Peter Pan, takes a dark and almost morbid take on J.M. Barrie's novel.  This may have not outshined the other epic films of 2003, which included Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, this film, didn't dissapoint in any aspect.  One thing that I found interesting about this film, is that there were no major stars, and it was kinda nice.  Without major Hollywood A listers you could get involved with the story, and pay attention less on the actors themselves.  One flaw I would like to make would be Tinkerbell, she wasn't a very personal character, just an annoying speck that stomped her feet and squeaked. All in all, a great child film, and great for adults and teens too.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|After the success died down from Michael Jackson's '79 smash, &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, he scored a second, and even bigger hit with 1982's &quot;Thriller&quot;. <br />Thriller's videos definately helped the album's success. The spooky title track with a poem reading by Vincent Price, was reflective of the horror-movie culture of the early 80's. The sleek R and B pop production, courtesy of Quincy Jones, gave Jackson the opportunity to show people the peek of his talent . . . and it shows everywhere on Thriller.<br />Thriller, Billy Jean, Beat It, and Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' are all unforgettable MJ classics. Thriller's videos, which were shown regularly on MTV, leveled anything else in their path. The great thing here, is not only do the singles work, but the album holds together well and it's fun and danceable. Even Weird Al made a video called &quot;Eat It&quot;, a parody of Beat It.<br />On a separate note, it's hard to believe that this is the same tragic, weird, childish, baby-dangling, white-skinned pop star we've come to know.
0790731002|1.0|this movie is terrible, a stupid lighthearted awful movie that i really feel is a waste of time and money. two face is a joker ripoff, and the riddler in this film makes me appreciate frank gorshin. kilmer is awful as batman, robin is annoying as usual, stick with batman returns, anything after is garbage.nyc
0061020710|5.0|I extremly enjoyed this humerous novel. I am a veteran reviewer and its hard to come by a novel this good.  It made me roll on the ground laughing and has a good enough plot to keep the serious reader content, 5 stars
006019250X|5.0|This book explains so many ordinary things that we encounter and not think about day to day. There's so many hidden truth in the book and deep philosophical concept that we don't usually think about. This book reminds us to follow our dreams no matter how hard it is to do so. It's a short book and an easy read. It's not meant for people to read it superficially. GREAT BOOK! BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!

B000009PNY|3.0|I am a Depeche Mode fan of the first degree, so it was only natural that I should pick up an album of covers from some pretty high-profile bands.  And while there are some things for the DM fan to enjoy here, at least half of the CD is a waste of time and space.<br />Let's consider what was done right.  The Cure and DM already have a major overlap in fan base, so I expected a good interpretation of \\"World in My Eyes\\" right off the bat.  I was not disappointed; this version is more fast-paced and has almost an Arabian feel to it.  Very cool and just as good as the original, in its own way.  The Deftones' \\"To Have and to Hold\\" is creepy and morose, a perfect song choice to create a nexus between the bands.  Chino Moreno's vocals here are less breathy than on some of his more recent albums such as White Pony, but the Deftones were still relatively new when this CD hit the shelves.  I also was drawn to Gus Gus' take on \\"Monument\\", which is frankly a DM song I was not previously aware of (probably a B-side from the early days... DJs have a talent for digging up obscure early Depeche Mode stuff to show how far back their obsession really goes.  Find Danny Tenaglia's remix of \\"I Feel Loved\\" for further evidence.)  Between this track and their two remixes of \\"Only When I Lose Myself,\\" I became a huge Gus Gus fan in no time.  I like Hooverphonic's attempt at \\"Shake the Disease\\" very much, a sultry trip-hop reinvention with the same heavy heart as the original.  Veruca Salt's retread of \\"Somebody\\" is not bad either, as the song already seems like it might come from a feminine perspective.<br />There are also some in-between efforts here that could have been so much better with just a few minor changes.  Failure's take on \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" is initially stunning because it is a pretty effective acoustic interpretation of a totally synthesized song.  Then the drums hit a little harder and suddenly you get whacked upside the head with a slab of distorted(...)guitar.  All of this would work really well if it weren't for the vocals.  This singer has a very whiney yet flat delivery that really disfigures what would otherwise be a pretty cool take on a well-known DM song.  Same goes for Dishwalla's \\"Policy of Truth.\\"  Good sonic arrangements are ruined by a guy who sounds like he wants to be Michael Hutchence but is really pretty far off the mark.<br />The rest of these tracks just sound very odd and quite often get skipped.  I have to admit, though, that Rammstein's \\"Stripped\\" is kind of addictive in its ridiculousness.<br />Worth buying if you're a deep DM fan and you don't mind skipping tracks to find the good covers.f this would work really well if it weren't for the vocals.

B0001CCXY8|5.0|These guys are the best death metal band out today and over the past 16 years they have been raising hell. Fisher has done a hell of a job taking over for Barnes and has helped deliver the best Corpse album ever. The Wretched Spawn is right now my album of the year, with that said I say to any death metal fan...PICK UP THIS ALBUM!
B00001OH7Y|4.0|I'm somewhat suprised that this album gets such high ratings. I love some of the songs, as Up the hill backwards, Ashes to ashes and Kingdom come, and the guitar work is oustanding. But the album lacks the ingenuity that I find on Hunky Dory and Low. Nevertheless Scary monsters is a major improvement to Lodger and, apart from his work for the TV-production of Brecht's Baal, his best work of the 80's.
B00004TH83|5.0|Nice voice that's suited to the kind of songs she sings.  Not like TINA ARENAS who's a pop singer-wannabe whose only prized possession is a misguided devoted fan pathetically named Derrick Lam.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|Those darn W brothers! Why did they have to end this otherwise great trilogy so poorly. The ending to this movie confused me and made me angry.<br />Why did Smith just blow up at the end?, I don't get it! why did Neo die but not the Oracle?<br />The ending to a Trilogy should make you feel satisfied, this just made me feel angry and Cheated.<br />The movie had some great moments, but a horrible ending.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is the greatest cd I own. It is classified as EMO-core or METAL-core. Whoever classified this cd as comparable to that (...) band that uses a disc jockey to make rock.. get your ears check. Second, whoever classified this cd as trying to be \\"death metal\\" get your ears removed. Cannibal Corpse is death metal. Six Feet Under is Death Metal. I'll go along with the guy that said that this cd blows \\"Hopesfall\\", \\"Poison the Well\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying\\" out of the water. This band has everything you want from a metal/punk band. Great guitar riffs (who cares if they are all in E), they are awesome. They have some of the best solos in rock music, (Dream Theater style) The lyrics are amazing and I would recoment this cd to anyone who likes punk or metal music. The talent in this band is amazing. Don't ever compare them to linkin park.... They can't even string their guitars themselves.

B0000039PW|5.0|Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: The entire album, but PLEASE skip the two sex skits. They SHOULD NOT have made this album.<br />Production: Thumbs up.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up, Biggie might have came the hardest at the time this was released.<br />Originality: Thumbs up. Check out \\"Gimme The Loot\\", as Biggie flips TWO different voices in the same song, the first time EVER.<br />The Last Word: CLASSIC material here, with absolutely no filler. This album is what put Bad Boy Records on the map, and it did so to the fullest. It's too bad that NO MC, other than Nas, represents like this today. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION for this album. You will not be disappointed.
B00005JN1L|5.0|When I went to see \\"Secret Window\\" I thought, what have I got myself in to? I don't like horror flicks, however, this movie was a thriller and contained a suprise ending that you would not figure out. Another Johnny Depp great. A must to ad to my movie collection.
B0000024IE|5.0|1990 was a TREMENDOUS year in hip hop, and this album is one of the reasons why. Public Enemy hadn't released an album in over a year, and they returned with a vengeance. Fear Of A Black Planet is a great listening experience. Once again, Chuck D gave us his narratives as only he can, Flavor Flav was the charismatic sidekick, and The Bomb Squad offered more classic production. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: Although this album has NO filler, the highlights are 911 Is A Joke, Welcome to the Terrordome, Burn Hollywood Burn, Who Stole The Soul, Fear Of A Black Planet, Revolution Generation, Can't Do Nuttin For Ya Man, War at 33 1/3, and the CLASSIC Fight The Power.<br />Production: Thumbs Up, more Bomb Squad classics.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs Up.<br />The Last Word: Man, what an album. From beginning to end, Public Enemy delivers the goods, on the THIRD album STRAIGHT. Not too many people can say they've done that. But overall, this album is a MUST HAVE. Another strong recommendation. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Short and sweet:  This series was great.  The concept is great.  The writing is spot on.  There are tons of memorable lines.  The actors were perfect...Summer plays River so well.  I wish there was more episodes.  If you like sci-fi, try it.  If you like family dramas, try it.  If you like crime shows, try it.  This fits into so many categories, it's hard to imagine someone not enjoying the show.
B0000024K1|5.0|If you are a long time hip hop fan like me, you remember the explosive year that was 1988, with all of the TIMELESS classics that were released that will stand the test of of time. Public Enemy's second album, It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, is one of the most influential albums to ever be released in music. NO ONE, other than Krs-One, came this politically correct on an album. Chuck D's delivery is so CAPTIVATING on this album that ever song he's on, you just have to listen to him all the way through. And what resulted was one EXCELLENT album. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: Let's keep it real, this entire album is worth listening to all the way through.<br />Production: Thumbs up, The Bomb Squad at their best.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs Up.<br />The Last Word: This is a MUST HAVE for any collection. I true masterpiece in the history of hip hop. Hip hop will NEVER be like this again. Another STRONG RECOMMENDATION.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Apart from the fact that the film is a great stylistic achievement its great merit is it's openness to varied interpretations. In the first part of the film things happen according to a conventional narrative, but in the second the logic of events breaks down. If one tries to decipher what's going on I think he is apt to miss the enjoyment of the dream-like visual sequences. Yet this does not imply that there's nothing to understand. Dreams do have meanings. It's just that they defy the kind of eplanation which we apply to events in awake life. When I saw the film I was following this principle, I didn't let my self feel perplexed, I tried to attune with the images and let my intition do the work of the understanding. I left the cinema mesmerized, I felt that my experience was as close as you could get being sober to a hallucinogenic exprerience and that was fantastic!<BR>For my part I felt that the film was preoccupied with the concept of personal identity. And if there was a message to it, for me it was this: free yourself from the illusion of the cartesian concept of the self as unitary substance and enjoy what happens. The Scotish philosopher David Hume argued that the self is nothing but a bundle of perceptions, no thing such as the self exists for whenever he entered most deeply into what he calls himself he never encountered anything but a perception and never a constant and invariable self. Now, the scene at the theatre where the band was performing a moving song reminded me of Hume's theory. There was no-one playing the song, yet it was moving. Ok, the connection is loose but this is what came to my mind. And then the girl's lapse of memory and in the end the changing of identities, reminded me of  Locke's theory of personal identity...<BR>Just the fact that after leaving the cinema I was excited thinking all these things would be enough for me to give 5 stars to the film, and it was captivating in many more ways...
B00005AQE8|4.0|The first true double album in hip hop with LOTS of historical significance. Pac raised the bar with All Eyez On Me, basically saying, &quot;look, I have so much tight stuff here, that one CD isn't enough.&quot; Pac truly set the standard for all double albums to follow and this was no fluke. Here's the review:<br />Disc One<BR>Album Highlights: Everything on the first disc is NICE, but do skip &quot;What'z Ya Phone #&quot; and take your time with &quot;Life Goes On.&quot;<br />Production: Thumbs Up.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs Up.<br />Originality: Thumbs Up.<br />Disc Two<BR>Album Highlights: Sadly, this may be the WORST second disc ever, as the ONLY true stand out song on this disc is All Eyez On Me. Everything else is absolute filler. Pac could've done much better. <br />Production: Thumbs in the middle, things got a little lazy.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs in the middle.<br />Originality: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Did Pac REALLY need E-40, and all them other WACK rappers on his album?<br />The Last Word: You'd think that with SO much filler on the second disc that this album would'nt get a four star rating, but with the historical significance on this album, the precedent it set, and the EXCELLENCE of the first disc, the four star rating is justified. If you are a true Pac fan, buy this album(be prepared to be bored with the second disc), otherwise, I slightly recommend this one.
074325144X|5.0|I was tired of the running books I've been reading to get help and then I found this book and have been so happy I got it.  The author puts into words feelings I have about running and it is so helpful and informative and teaches you HOW to run safely...I have had knee problems while running (what's new for a regular runner...seems everyone does) and the method in this book has made so much difference after just a short time of practicing it...it's really pretty simple, but there so much more if you want it.  I am so excited about this book...it's given me a new lease on my running...I want to tell everyone about it!!!
B0000039QA|4.0|1997 started off with a bang for Biggie, but sadly six months after 2-Pac was murdered, he was murdered himself. If only he was alive to promote his sophomore double CD, Biggie would reigning supreme at this moment. But this album, Life After Death, is a GREAT experience to listen to. It moves me every time I listen to it, and it's one album that never lets you go. Here's the review:<br />Disc One<BR>Album Highlights: The entire first disc. ONLY listen the track with R.Kelly when you're with \\"that special someone.\\"<br />Production: Thumbs up.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.

While it's NOT better than Ready To Die, this is still Biggie at his best before his death. Overall, a strong recommendation to purchase this album. Don't sleep.
B0000025T6|5.0|Raw and unrelenting, Nebraska is a shock to the casual Bruce fan's system. Alike nothing he had created before, it was a true testament of Bruce's artistry.  He rarely gets enough credit for the chances he took musically through the years--Nebraska being probably his biggest one. This album could have been awful. It could have cemented the notion that Bruce could never be anything close to \\"Dylanesque.\\" This could have done to him what going electric did to Dylan. But...it didn't. Not only does Nebraska prove Bruce's lyrical talent, but it also proves that he is not just the electric guitar wielding, theatric stage performer that we all know and love.<br /><br />Recorded on his own tape recorder, in his bedroom, it's just Bruce and his acoustic guitar yearning for redemption, deliverance, and a reason to believe. The lyrics on this album will get inside you immediately, within the first few lines of the title track. They will pull you into the desolate world of his disparaged and lonely characters. Bruce is a master at painting portraits of life in his words by creating characters you can feel, see, and love. On `Nebraska', he creates antiheroes for the common man. In \\"Johnny 99\\" you start to empathize with the main character as he descends toward madness after losing his job at the plant in Mahwah late last month. In \\"Highway Patrolman\\" Bruce displays the moral ambiguity of an honest man torn between his duty as a law officer and his own flesh and blood. Others like \\"Used Car\\" and \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" are Bruce's retelling of his childhood memories. They will leave you feeling lost in time, like you are looking into the soul of an old black and white portrait.<br />\\"State Trooper\\" is a song like no other. Bruce himself wasn't sure if it could be even called a song, but he threw it on the record anyway. I wouldn't recommend listening to it while driving alone, especially after midnight, because it might scare the s*** out of you. Either that, or you will go mad and drive endlessly trying to escape from nowhere.<br />`Nebraska' is one of those albums that takes on a whole new persona depending on when you listen to it. In the daytime, it is a realistic journey into the past, a walk with each character down the street of hopelessness towards a meaningful existence. At night, however, it turns into a descent into loneliness, desperation and uncertain fear. Listening to this record will definitely take you somewhere. It may be somewhere unpleasant, somewhere to close for comfort, to real to discern. It may take you to a place where everything you've ever known in life fails you. And it may strike you kind of funny...but at the end you'll somehow be left with more of a reason to believe.ive endlessly trying to escape from nowhere.<br />`Nebraska' is one of those albums that takes on a whole new persona depending on when you listen to it.

B00005AQGH|5.0|This album is EXCELLENT and MYSTERIOUS at the same time, as it was speculated that Pac uttered the words &quot;Suge shot me&quot; at the beginning of this album. This album was also going to be the transformation of Pac's alter-ego, Makaveli, inspired the legendary figure of the same name. Makaveli Records, if you didn't know, was truly in the works around this time, with the first acts slated to be The Outlawz, but Pac's untimely death prevented that from happening. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: Although there's no filler on this album, the stand out cuts are Bomb First(a dis to New York MCs, namely Nas, Jay-Z, Mobb Deep, and Biggie), Hail Mary, To Live and Die In L.A., Blasphemy, Daddy, Me and my Girlfriend, and Against All Odds(where he disses Nas and Prodigy).<br />Production: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards up.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs Up.<br />The Last Word: This is a GREAT album from 2-Pac. While certainly NOT better than Me Against The World, but SLIGHTLY better than All Eyez On Me, this is Pac in his true unpredictable form. He delivered the goods on this album, and it'll certainly stand the test of time. Strongly recommended.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|O.K. I am willing to ceed the fact that this movie is flawed, but it is also one of the most complex and thought provoking films I have ever seen.  Yes the acting and the pacing could have been a lot better.  Yes the Brothers have a nack for writing some very cheesey lines, but to dismiss the philosophic underpinings of this film as mindless hokum (as some reviewers have done) would be to deny these series of films their greatess strength.  Science Fiction, more than any other genre, has the ability to raise complex questions about the nature of the human experience.  If you pay close attention several themes dealing with issues of control, power, fate, faith, hope and most importantly to mind CHOICE come up again and again.  I have my own theories about what these films might be trying to say, and a lot of that goes against what other viewers have thought these movies were about, and I'm not going to waste your time explaining my theory (the open ended conclusion of the story suggests that the brothers wanted people to find their own meaning in these films).  Now maybe you don't like philosophy and such and just want to see cool Kung Fu (then watch the first film), but if you want to go deeper watch these films again and again and think about what kind of views each of these characters represent.  I think the reason these films were greeted with such hostility is that they actually challanged viewers to think about what was going on (instead of showing you exactly what they were trying to get at).  Most modern entertainment gives us all the answers, these films ask you to try and come up with some on your own.  Try it, because making up your own mind is far more rewarding than being told what to think.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|This CD is incredible.  The &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; series seems to have hit the nail on the head.  The sound is excellent, and the extra tracks actually add to the experience.  This is one awesome CD.  <br />I also recommend &quot;Mississippi Muddy Waters Liver&quot; Deluxe Edition.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|The cast alone makes this movie good.  I found it moved a little slow at first but when all is said and done it will leave you feeling satisfied.  It is often very funny, touching, deeply sad at times-it will take your emotions on a ride.  What I liked the most was that this is a film that doesn't insult your intelligence and there is no sophomoric humor (no fart jokes)!
B00005JMEW|4.0|First of all, no matter what anyone else tells you, Kill Bill Volume 1 is not the be-all and end-all of action movies. I was not 'wow-ed' like I was with Pulp Fiction. To be honest, I don't even fully know how I felt about the movie, other than it was 'cool.' <br />Yes, but that, it seems, is the intention of Tarentino. No, he's not godlike in his directing prowess, he merely knows what's cool and what isn't, and what appeals to certain audiences. No matter how you look at it, people fighting with katanas will always be cool. There's no two ways about it. It just is.<br />On that note, this is a very cool movie, but not much else. The basis of the entire movie is this: Uma Thurman, as The Bride, has her family killed when she's pregnant at the alter, and decides to get revenge. That's it. That all gets explained in about five minutes. The rest is just cool.
B000002KAT|5.0|Words cannot describe how amazing this album is. It is complex and sublime and reveals new things with each listen. Everyone should have this record. For me, this is the most inspiring thing I've ever heard and it still gives me goosebumps when I hear it.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Revolutions disappoints me the most of the three movies.  I am writing this for fellow sci-fi fans, and for myself, to briefly analyze the question - why the formula in the sequels do not work as well as the original Matrix.  So I'm mainly reviewing the movie in the 3-part series, not the DVD.<br />All three main characters - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus - in Reloaded and Revolutions, are just too lifeless, aside from the obvious, that there is a departure from the story for the sake of big budget effects (Hey, I love well-made fx, don't get me wrong!)  Or is it just bad acting?  (I know, I know. They were supposed to be computerized.)  I'll tell you what I think is the culprit - those darn sunglasses.  Acting is in the eyes, and if you can't see the eyes, out goes the expression.  Why do they have to wear the sunglasses underground, also?  Fashion?  Who cares about looking cool when the whole world is coming to an end!  For argument sake, look back at the original Matrix.  Neo and Trinity were newbies and fresh, trying to solve the puzzle - how to save humanity.  There was more self-discovery in the &quot;real&quot; world, on board the Neberknezzer (mispelled, huh).  Neo, Trinity and Morpheus were not so busy trying to look cool as in the sequels.  Believe or not, my favorite character is the Oracle.  Even though she has a small part, she is the only one I care about the most.  She possesses a lot of spunk for a matrix concontion.  Too bad, the original actress, is not in Revolutions, because of her unfortunate, untimely death in real life.  (Did you catch the irony of what she eats in Reloaded?)  Revolutions take place 100% underground or in a very cloudy world, so you vampires will feel at home.  The Sentinals vs. the human machines is worth a look-see, but the Super Burly Brawl is not as fun to watch as before because the bad weather makes it hard to see.  I just wish Mr. Smith and Neo had chosen to slap-each-other-silly on a day that wasn't raining.  As a grand finale, the ending is convoluted, leaving more questions than answers.  It leaves an unsatisfactory feeling in my stomach, kind of like amusement park food.  As tragic as the story is going, The Wachowski Brothers sell out by slapping on a hollywood-like ending.  Sunny skies and all.<br />If you don't care about the story that much, but want amazing visuals, I would recommend Reloaded over Revolutions.  The martial arts choreography, with weapons, this time, is amazing.  And the highway scene is unsurpassable.  However, if you can only afford one DVD in this series, and you want the best, get the first Matrix.  (Now, I have to figure out why George Lucas messed up the prequels.  Jar Jar... Lucas trying to please his kids...)
0613673298|5.0|This book has got to be one of the smartest and funniest things I've read in a while.  It combines two great writters into one incredible story that starts off with a bang and keeps rolling towards one large goal.  It was quite hard to put down!  I highly recommend this book to all Gaiman and Pratchett fans.
B000002KHH|5.0|By the time this came out in 1970 Sabbath were already underground favorites. I was 16 at the time and my friends and I sat in my basement and listened to this the day it came out ( on vinyl) cranked way up. We had no idea what to expect after the first album! There was no one else quite like Sabbath. Blue Cheer, Budgie, Deep Purple, Zepplin, etc., were all great bands but Sabbath had a heavy, dark, truthful vibe like nobody else. I saw the tour that supported this album and it was incredible. The words to War Pigs could not be any more relevant in our world than right now. Planet Caravan is one of my favorite songs. It is great to \\"mellow out\\" to. It has been so cool to witness how this album has stood the test of time. \\"GOODNIGHT FROM BLACK SABBATH...WE LOVE YOU ALL!\\"
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|ten years ago I was forced to watch this with a friend for her film class. I thought this was the biggest waist of two hours (don't worry it feels more like four).<br />So when this same friend's brother asked if I wanted to see it I said sure, I've grown and matured... unfortunatly this film has not.<br />This is one of those rare movies that many cinephiles have written and heard about, but is pure mysogynistic drivel, barely having a plot or any shred of talent as far as acting. I've read how it is influencial and all, but this movie is just downright boring and mysogynistic and confusing.<br />If you are interested in the whole London Mod scene see either Absolute Beginners, Quadraphenia or any Austin Powers movie. Otherwise move on to the new century please.
B000022TSW|5.0|This is a daring and hilarious movie that is not for people with delicate dispositions. It is as offensive as possible, taking no prisoners. Because it came out in 1999, there is a blissful ignorance of the coming mess in Iraq following 9/11/01. Saddam and Satan no longer seem so terrifying. But forget that... The movie is nothing short of audacious. When I first saw it, my mouth was open in shock when I wasn't roaring with laughter. The minute it came out on dvd, I bought it. And it's a great musical to boot! I've urged every person I know to buy it, and will continue to do so.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I first watched American Beauty a few nights ago after putting it off for years. I instantly wanted to see this film after it scooped all those Oscars back in 2000, but I never got around to doing so. To cut a long story short, I watched it the other night, after forgetting about it. My expectations, admittedly, were rather low. How wrong I was.<br />Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your average, middle-aged family man. He works a $60,000 per annum job and lives as home with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who is a straight-laced, worry wart who sells real estate and is obsessed with looking her best and being successful. They both have a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) who is your typical rebellious teenage girl, unsatisfied with her figure, despises her parents and longs for someone who will love her. Living next door we have the 18-year-old Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who lives with his father Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his rather catatonic wife. What we have appears to be two typical American families, living through the trials and tribulations of family life, and living the American dream.<br />However, things are certainly not as they seem, and director Sam Mendes cleverly unravels this as the film progresses. Lester instantly falls for his daughter's best friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a game. His marriage is currently in a rut, his wife hates him and they haven't made love in a long, long time. Her beauty transforms him, and some of the greatest moments of this movie are where he detaches from reality and slips into a fantasy world where it is just him and her together - the most famous being the nude rose petals scene. He is soon working out and building himself up to impress her. Jane is 'friends' with this vixen character Angela, but at times the latter's beauty depresses Jane, who is already insecure about her appearance. Angela can't understand why Ricky isn't interested in her, just because every other guy is. Ricky, however, is more interested in Jane. She hides it at first, but deep down, she's touched that someone is interested in her. What blossoms is a sweet and beautiful relationship, despite the insane parents they both have. Some of the film's best moments are the intimate connections of loneliness that these two angst-ridden teenagers share.<br />Ricky's father is one of the most striking and memorable characters from the film, and all for the wrong reasons. He's a homophobic and straight-laced man who lives his life by rules. When he bursts into Ricky's room and beats him for entering his secret room, not only are we shocked by what is happening, but by Ricky's lack of resistance. Suddenly we realise why he spends so much time filming floating paper bags, dead birds and Jane - he believe in the hope of escapism from his horrific father (&quot;Yes Sir. Thank you Sir.&quot;). We also realise why Ricky's mother is slightly catatonic - she has obviously been beaten into submission by the evil man. This is the point in the film, in my opinion, in which the film's dark and violent side breaks through. American life is not as shiny and happy as it seems.<br />Carolyn starts an affair with her real estate competition, and it's truly funny to see her try and act all sophisticated around Lester. She is so materialistic, it's unreal. It's more important to her than living, and it's a sad state of affairs when we witness this. The finale to the film is superb. By the end she's a self-help sad case and a gun-toting loony who realises everything she's lost. Lester takes more control of his life, dropping his $60,000 a year job to take up a job in a fast-food restaurant (I love his line, &quot;I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility!&quot;). He lets go of his whole life and responsibilities. He decides to look after himself and perfecting his goal on bedding Angela. By the end of the film he almost succeeds, until she confesses it's her first time. All the blabbing about the action she's been getting is all rubbish. Lester realises too late how immature he has been, and he can't go back and change it. The conclusion of Lester's final state comes from someone who cannot face up to who he is, because he lives by society's expectations. He can't face up to being something he is so against, and this serves as a stark reminder to us all.<br />The whole film is superbly filmed and brilliantly acted. Kevin Spacey is superb, as is Annette Bening. Thora Birch is simply gorgeous as Jane, and her angst-ridden teenage role of rebellion is incredibly believable. Wes Bentley shines amazingly, and Mena Suvari is very convincing as that feisty vixen. This really is one of the best-assembled casts I have ever seen from a movie. Sam Mendes pulled off an amazing feat in directing this movie, and for once, the Academy got it right in making this Best Picture Of The Year. There are moments in this film that I can relate to more than any other film, and some moments make me want to cry because of the intense emotion on display.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />I watched this film with my mum the other day - she didn't like it much because of the swearing, but that's to be expected, but to dismiss it as a poor film as she did stunned me. This was by far one of the best movies I have ever seen, and a few obscenities isn't going to change that! The soundtrack to this film is equally stunning - the quiet music in these intimate moments is fantastic and completely draws you into the film with the characters. All in all, this is a must see movie for anyone who is a fan of social satires. A masterpiece of the biggest standards.'s been getting is all rubbish.

6305232660|4.0|Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni and Elijah Woods provide their best preformance on how the astriod clashes with earth and how long it would be. This movie was so good it should've won an oscar for best picture, anyways, if you're looking for those great suspense action dramas with great storylines such as the world coming to an end, this movie is definitely for you. Great and Astonishing.
B00008O31H|5.0|I would give these guys a ten stars if I could. They are so simple yet so profound. Rock rifts that remind me of a mix between Blues and Classic Rock, yet with a style all there own. And vocals that sound like a mix of B.B. King, the Stones, Clapton, and Hendrix. Just amazing. If you can listen to &quot;Have love will travel&quot; and not get into them, you never will. Each song they will take you through such a raw, emotional, and rewarding journey. Try them out, I would argue they are better than the White Stripes, see for yourself!
B0000CDL93|5.0|A conspiracy of who shot JFK and how will the killer/s get caught, hard to understand and the only movie made with 18 different suspects and uncanny charecters and lawers seeking for the truth of a past murder that with all the facts can never be solved due to the corruption of corperate america. Everybody might have been on it and the hunt for the killer of JFK will reopen in the year 2029 by the federal council of Washington. This was a great movie you'll love to watch and conspicuiousy is in the air of Los Angles and Houston during the 60s, how America fell after the death of one of the greatest presidents in American History and how Cuba came back. One of Oliver Stone's best movies and a remarkable outlook of how the most famous figure left the earth. Outstanding.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Lets get one thing straight.  If you are looking for another \\"Pulp Fiction\\", leave right now.  If you're looking for a good film with great style and good action, see the movie.  In reality, this movie is nothing more than a stylized samurai revenge flick, the the style is so incredible, it makes the movie worth watching.  <br />(...) <br />The film has everything, from Monty Python-eque fake looking bright red blood gushing over, to an entire 15 minute segement which is done as an anamai cartoon.  The film is good, but its hardly the best movie that Tarantino has done, but its still a fun watch.  The line that pretty much summarizes up the film is when Thurman's character says \\"To those of you that still have your lives, you may leave with those.  Leave your limbs; they now belong to me\\"<br />Oh, and a sidenote- if blood and violence makes you uncomfortable, this film definately is not for you.
B0000047EC|5.0|This is a great cd that I have recently become hip to(o) it is almost as good as my metalica, cattlepress, or carcus records which rock my mind on an out of body experience that only my neo-classical death metal dude's can thrash. I listen to the intimacy and am like ... wow this is almost as good as iron maiden -and trust me I can rationalize ways in which iron maiden become musical geniuses in my warp. Rock On!!!!  . . . (?)
B00000IP3S|5.0|I hate writing long reviews.  So I will say this: if you have been hearing a LOT of death metal and thrash metal or gothenburg lately, and do not know much power metal at all, get this - it is very good.  This cd has so much new to offer if you don't know power metal.  Tastefully placed and passionately performed solos with an emphasis on energizing melodies and the progression of melody to melody.  Hansi's passionate voice, which has many sides (not just all screaming) and all of which are extemely melodic and passionate.  The songs are never boring, never predictable, and sound really really &quot;classic&quot; to me.  This is music with momentum - there's a LOT going on, and I like every second of it.  I am proud of blind guardian of adding their ideas to metal music, they obviously put a lot of thought into this album and for what it is, it is a perfect album.
B00018D44U|2.0|in comparsion to her first album, this definately pales.. Its boring and too country.. not just country-tinged.. Its horrible. If i wanted country i would have gone to the Country section. <BR>Even my boyfriend who loves 'Come Away with Me' agrees that 'Feels like Home' is a very lame follow-up.
B000092Q4U|3.0|I don't understand the fuss around the band's new sound.  They just took the gothenburg approach - wow, shadows fall did the same thing way before them.  Ok, ok they're not fully gothenburg.  They can still slam down some &quot;breakdowns&quot; - you wanna hear a breakdown? Listen to &quot;riot of violence&quot; by Kreator.  Now that's killer riffs - not slamming the e chord in &quot;complicated&quot; patterns.  And it would be nice to hear some variety with the singer, hearing his same voice every song just makes the album that much more monotonous.   I think these guys are cool- they got some necksnappin riffs, chris poland does a solo(who was in megadeth by the way, listen to peace sells) and they kinda have a special &quot;groove&quot; sound.  The lyrics are real good too.  But the album comes across as nothing new, and there's not enough ideas to keep it fresh.   If you want to mosh it's a good album, I agree.  If you want to listen to good hardcore, listen to Machine Head Burn my Eyes, imo.  Ok ok sorry this is kinda offensive, so this is all IMO. Heh.
B000068OSK|5.0|The minimalist thing is done to perfection by Jack and Meg on this album...but wait till you hear what Jack White can do on guitar with a fully-rockin' band with him...    I recommend checking out Jack White in his first band \\"THE GO\\" on the album \\"WHATCHA DOIN'\\"   Absolutely righteous!      The White Stripes are a great band limited only by the fact that there's only two of them.  With such a limited cast-- you have to be multi-faceted.
B000069AUI|1.0|Oh please.  This music is NOT complicated, and it does NOT take as much talent as it seems.  If you think this is heartbreaking beautiful, listen to Blind Guardian's album 'Imaginations from the other side'.  If you listen to some of the stuff from that album, you'll realize coldplay are dwarfed.  If you do not and slam my review, you did not get any smarter.<br />Sorry guys im just tired of all this &quot;intellectual&quot; level criticism these guys are getting, while truly talented musicians go unnoticed.  But this is how it is - people don't go beyond mtv these days.

B00000JCOV|1.0|9 people and this product?  These morons are just trying to look bad and have no taste in music.  you can't just scream and write dumb riffs ripped off slayer and call it breakthrough music.  I came on this cd and threw it off the window.  You should do the same and listen to 'Reign in Blood' by slayer written in 1986 and shreds this to pieces.  PIECE BY PIECE.
0385504209|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  Once you think you have solved the mystery, more questions pop up and you are entrenched in the novel once again. I do not think that the writers of the reviews which claim that Brown is anti-Christian understood the book at all.  Brown is not trying to stain Christianity.  In fact he praises religion and the many ways it helps people all over the world.  In fact the different gospels of the Bible do not match up and some contradict each other.  I do not see people trying to discourage others from reading the Bible or calling the gospels stains on Christianity.  Why can't people just accept the book as it is-- a suggestion of an alternate history.  People need to open their minds and challenge their way of thinking; one should not accept everything that has been spoon fed to them.
B00005NKKY|5.0|Well, the first time I ever heard Simon and Garfunkel I must have been about eleven years old. At the time, I was a total NSYNC fanatic (woe is me hehe), but I can recall being totally captivated by their voices, melodies, and genius (especially to an NSYNC fan) lyrics. <BR>   Well, time has passed and now I'm into much better music (don't worry, I'm cured). I've heard it all, from Bob Dylan to The Beatles, Tom Petty to Pearl Jam, tons of bands. And this album still fascinates me. It's words and music are full of nostalgia (yup, even for a fourteen year old) and memories. <BR>  \\"Bookends\\" is about life...from adolescent dreams and frustrations to falling in love as a young adult, to growing old and realizing you're aging and not as you used to be. \\"Bookends\\" is impossible to not make an emotional attachment to. It was meant to be digested and taken in as not music, but an album of a reflection of life. <BR>   BUY IT. You won't regret it, I promise. Simon and Garfunkel made some truly beautiful music here, and you can't deny it's not one of their bests.
0393314804|3.0|I don't doubt that this is a treffic book with and message. But I couldn't over look the fact that I can't understand what the author is saying. Oppose to telling you the character has a thick scotish accent but writes with an accent. REad a few excepts, you can't understand what the characters are saying. I know I couldn't. I thought at first thta I could get use to it, but by the 50th page I only understood about 1% of what I read. I'm american and we have a more nasal accent. I simply don't understand this book.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|OK, I heard a lot of negative things about this movie, so I put off seeing it. What got me to finally watch it was the fact that I love Halle Berry. I could watch her in just about anything! In GOTHIKA, Miranda Grey (Ms. Berry) is a psychologist who has a head-on collision with the supernatural. On her way home from work (at Woodward Penitentiary for Women), she gets caught in a torrential rainstorm, is detoured, and almost hits a girl standing in the middle of the road. Miranda swerves around the girl and into a ditch. After climbing out of her car, she goes to the girl to make sure she's alright. The girl spontaneously catches fire and puts her flaming hands on Miranda, causing her to black out. Upon waking, Miranda finds herself incarcerated in the very penitentiary she works in, sedated, and accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton), who also happens to have been her boss. Things get really weird from here! Miranda is visited several times by the ghost-girl from the road and given clues to what's really going on. Can she put the pieces together before being tried for a murder she barely remembers? Robert Downey Jr. plays a subdued role as Miranda's doctor and former colleague. Penelope Cruz is Miranda's ex-patient turned fellow inmate, who has clues of her own to share. Why did Miranda kill her husband? How can she escape her prison in order to work out this mystery? The answers to these questions are the ice-cold backbone of this story. Bathed in darkness, rain, and blue-filtered light, Gothika wears it's forboding spirit on it's sleeve. However, it's well done and Halle bumps this movie up a few notches just because she's in it. She's a dominant force and carries the film well. A spooky thriller-chiller...
B00001OH7P|5.0|Dearest sigh,<BR>     With the release of Ziggy, Mr. Bowie bent a lot reality.  There simply are not the correct words to describe the undulation of realities that occured after Ziggy.  Pulses and gamma, grandma and santa.  These words might work, but then again they are just words.  Salvation is from the latin: salvos = to make whole again.
B00005JMSE|3.0|Here?s come another one ? another feature film adaptation of a classic comic book series. Ever since the comic book genre was revitalized by X-Men in 2000 and elevated to escalating popularity thanks to Spider-Man in 2003, it has been the top priority of every major movie studio in Hollywood to jump on the latest band wagon and grab a comic book franchise in which to roll several features, if at all possible. Granted that most of the major comic book series have been picked up and the only ones left are the less well-known franchises, but aren?t the filmmakers that choose these projects all the more braver then those with the so-called ?sure-fire? hits?  Guillermo del Toro hasn?t clearly shown that after taking the directing reins in the already hot Blade film franchise for Blade II, which managed successful to out-gross the original, but now he really gets to show how brave of a filmmaker he is with a project he?s been working on for nearly six years. After shopping the experimental project around for quite some time, del Toro will now have the shot to bring the cult-classic to life but whether or not his hard work will pay off is still in the air.<br />The story follows a young devil brought to Earth through a pagan ritual and saved by the United States Army on his journey to grow up and become a man. Nearly sixty years ago, the Nazis, in a last ditch effort to win the war against the Allied Powers, stage a cult experiment to unleash the seven gods of Chaos and destroy the world, all being led by the mysterious Grigori Rasputin. But when the United States Army intervenes, the lurid experiment goes awry and, as a result, tares the child of Satan, later named Hellboy, from his home. After he is adopted by Professor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is brought up as a force of good, rather then evil, working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, protecting the world from all supernatural forces that may threaten it. His latest mission brings him in touch with the Nazi cult followers that brought him into the world sixty years ago, only this time they are adamantly determined to finish the job they started, which includes using Hellboy to fulfill his true purpose ? unleashing the seven gods of Chaos and bringing about the end of the world. The story for Hellboy, as confusing and outlandish as it may seem, was surprisingly quite interesting but is definitely one that requires not necessarily a true understanding of the comic book series it is based on but an awareness of historical figures that the feature presents, as well as the legends surrounding those characters. If you go into this film without at least a reasonable sense of what is going on, you?re not going to understand one solitary thing within this film. In that case, don?t bother going at all ? you?re just going to waste your money.<br />Unlike other comic book adaptations, Hellboy does not feature a whole lot of A-list talent but none-the-less features one of the most impressive casts this year, despite several flaws that become evident as the feature progresses. Ron Perlman is Hellboy, no ifs, ands, or buts about it! Perlman was apparently the major requirement by Guillermo del Toro when he shopped around the project and was one of the major setbacks for the project as well with the studios wanting someone more famous to play the red hero. Fortunately for movie-goers, del Toro stuck to his guns and showcases a real eye for talent with Perlman?s marvelous performance. John Hurt, who portrays Professor Bruttenholm, gives a delightful performance of a character that cares dearly for his adopted son but knows clearly that his time on Earth is running out. You can?t help but have a tear in your eye during his final scene in the film. There were few problems with the cast but the ones that were contrary to the rest were quite evident, this included Jeffrey Tambor and Karel Roden. It wasn?t necessarily their performances but the characters themselves. Tambor plays some-what of an adversary to Hellboy in the course but you never exactly get an idea why this is.

B00003CXTG|2.0|December 7th, 1941 ... It was, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt so bluntly put it, a day that would live in infamy. The attack on Pearl Harbor over sixty years ago was less of an attack on the American people themselves as it was an attack on our military defense, an area we once thought was invincible and something our enemies would never attempt to provoke. But on that fateful morning, the unthinkable happened and from then on things changed but as time went on Americans returned to the isolationistic attitude that had gotten us in trouble in the first place ... It has been said, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That happened on September 11th, 2001, where 3,000 American lives were lost. But the American people are not an intimidatable bunch and we rose to the challenge, just like we did after the event at Pearl Harbor, to root out evil and wreak havoc on those who dared to try and terrorize us. No better moral support could be spoken better then what was said by President Bush, who stated, \\"We have known freedom's price. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory\\".<br />The story centers around a love triangle between two men who fall in love with the same nurse and their struggle to win her heart, all set against the tragic attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Rafe McCawley is a hot-shot flying ace in the United States Arms Air Corp. but it wasn't easy, as it required a young U.S. Navy nurse named Evelyn Stewart to pass him despite the fact that reading ability was slightly below average. From that moment on they fall deeply in love with each other but the time they spend together is short-lived as Rafe has been accepted to a program that sends American air pilots over to Britain to help fight off the German Blitzkrieg, one that he applied to himself. While he is overseas fighting in the war, Rafe asks his best friend Danny Walker to watch after Evelyn but when word came about that Rafe's plane came down over the ocean - basically declaring him dead - things change quickly between Danny and Evelyn from friendship to a full-fledge infatuation. Then suddenly Rafe returns alive and just as a full confrontation between the two friend is about to erupt - catastrophe hits as the Japanese sneak attack Pearl Harbor and throw the United States head first into World War II. The story for Pearl Harbor, as hard as it attempted to stick with historical accuracies, lacks severely and doesn't feel as though the filmmakers were taking this seriously, even by Jerry Bruckheimer standards. Praise must be given to Bay and Bruckheimer for attempting to create a patriotically charged feature but next time they should view The Patriot and see how it is done correctly.<br />Once again Bruckheimer chooses a great group of talented veteran actors and fresh newcomers to head this project but despite several promising, and even surprising, performances, the script is too bland and dull for any one person to really step above the rest. Ben Affleck's performances have often been described as flat and though that can be disputed, that statement would be true for his role in this film. If there is one thing Affleck needs to improve on from this role is how to cry ... He just sounds absolutely ridiculous when he does cry and any emotional quality that was to be retained in those scenes is slightly lost. Despite a fairly handicapped performance, Affleck does manage to work well with newcomers Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, who both give decent performances with the weak material they are given. Though the script does tend to hinder many of the main performers in this feature, several actors do manage to transcend beyond that to give excellent performances. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s role as Dorie Miller is one of those performance and is based on an actual historical figure that fought bravely against the Japanese Kamikazes at Pearl Harbor. It would have been nice to note that his character went on to fight in World War II after the event and died in combat aboard a submarine but that could be taken as a bit of downer at this film, which was obviously something the filmmakers didn't want. And the biggest surprise out of all the performances was the one given by Dan Aykroyd, who is best known for his comedic performances and often stays away from dramatic performances. But despite the lack of experience in this genre, Aykroyd gives a convincing performance that works well early on but for some reason the character ends up just dropping off around the mid-way point, which wasn't too big of a problem, just a slight issue.<br />Overall, Pearl Harbor gives the Walt Disney Company their Titanic but the film ends up more like the ship rather then the movie in that its enormous extravagance results in its demise. Despite not receiving the same box office success its inspiration received, Pearl Harbor finds similarity to Titanic in that both features suffer from numerous clichés, a flat and unintentionally humorous script, and a time length that feels excruciating as the feature begins to wrap-up at the end. If one were to find even a few compliments for this film it would definitely to be its absolutely astonishing battle sequences that are presented in such vivid detail that it is almost heart-wrenching, though the filmmakers didn't go to quite the level that Steven Spielberg did with Saving Private Ryan. Another worthy aspect of the film was its musical score, which was created by brilliant composer Hans Zimmer who also wrote scores for The Lion King and The Last Samurai. But the breathe-taking visuals and the brilliant musical score aren't enough to save this feature from being nothing more then a poor attempt to cash in on the success of Titanic, as well as the American military men and women who died at Pearl Harbor. Want true patriotism on the big screen? Rent The Patriot.

If you are not, then I recommend you stay away from it.<br />I picked this book up on a whim, without ever having read anything by Tim Burton. I loved the Nightmare Before Christmas and enjoy the work of people like Angus Oblong, Jhonen Vasquez, Roman Dirge, and Gorey-- so I figured, why not?<br />Although it's not the best poetry ever (I'm not a poet, I don't know very much about rhythm or anything like that), I found them to be very touching.  The layout is very nice and pleasing, and some of the poems are laugh out loud funny, while others are starkly sad and leave a big impression on the reader.  The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy was strikingly sad in my opinion, and I nearly cry when I read the poem \\"Anchor Baby\\".<br />The book itself is a beautifully bound hardcover book-- it looks very nice sitting on a shelf, and I think it would be great to have sitting on a living room coffee table (..that is, if I didn't live in a dorm)<br />The ONLY reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it is a little bit pricey, in my opinion.  I would consider buying a second hand copy, if possible.

B0000DZTIW|4.0|Last year was the year of big budget epics for Hollywood.  No expense was spared for lavish spectacle, elaborate costuming, awe-inspiring battle scenes, and more.  And Hollywood knows that in spite of tremendous attention to visuals, it can all fall flat without the right soundtrack.  George Lucas even admitted that Star Wars would have been nothing without John Williams' music.  Hans Zimmer, in his score to The Last Samurai proves once again he's one of the best film composers working today.  He complements the visual and dramatic aspects of the film superbly, as in the track Spectres in the Fog.  Listen, and you can practically picture the action, even if you've never seen the film.  After an introduction featuring Japanese plucked strings, the opening is haunting and mysterious, from which emerges a heroic theme played in the horns.<br />I was interested to compare this soundtrack to that for another, contemporaneous \\"Big Spectacle\\" film-Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King, with music by Howard Shore.  If you compare Spectres in the Fog to Shore's Minas Tirith, you'll hear that the gesture is identical--the emergence from a mysterious, static texture of a noble theme in the horns, accompanied by the drums of war.  Both soundtracks owe much to the heritage of Richard Wagner and are practically textbooks in composing for film.  Anyone interested in learning that art would do well to study them in detail.  One significant difference between the two scores is the basic orchestration-naturally enough The Last Samurai includes Japanese instruments, and blends them beautifully with a Western orchestra.  Since Middle Earth doesn't actually exist, Shore had no authentic instruments to draw from, and relies instead on a large Western orchestra, but occasionally has the instrumentalists perform in unusual ways, creating unique tone colors, as in Minas Morgul.<br />But perhaps the biggest difference between the two soundtrack CDs, other than Shore's Oscar, is the overall tone.  The Return of the King soundtrack is action-filled, exciting and even, for some, nerve-wracking.  The Steward of Gondor is a telling example-while it's a beautiful ballad, Shore adds growing string clusters behind the voice to create a sense of impending doom.  Zimmer's score is more consistently introspective.  For the most part it concentrates on wistful melancholy and loss rather than the fury of battle-this is especially true of the soundtrack CD.  A Small Measure of Peace epitomises this tone beautifully, while The Way of the Sword is its most dramatic contrast.  Those who prefer their music peaceful and meditative will love The Last Samurai and perhaps be driven mad by Return of the King.  Personally I prefer Shore's work somewhat, although still admiring Zimmer's greatly.  Perhaps Howard Shore was the Oscar winner because he works with a much broader palate-more themes and a wider range of techniques including some very contemporary ones that would surely alienate many audience members if heard in concert with no visual context.  By contrast, The Last Samurai relies too much on a single theme.  It's lovely beyond question, and noble when played by horns, and courageous when played by trumpets, but after a point, many of the tracks on the CD start to seem indistinguishable.  Nonetheless, why Zimmer didn't even get an Oscar nomination escapes me.erall tone.  The Return of the King soundtrack is action-filled, exciting and even, for some, nerve-wracking.

Since Middle Earth doesn't actually exist, Shore had no authentic instruments to draw from, and relies instead on a large Western orchestra, but occasionally has the instrumentalists perform in unusual ways, creating unique tone colors.  Listen to the unworldly treatment of the woodwinds at the beginning of Shore's Minas Morgul, a work heavily inspired not only by the music of Richard Wagner, but also Sergei Prokofiev-in particular his Scythian Suite.  Shore also makes use of folk music styles of the British Islands, since Tolkien's book was meant as an English Mythology, as when Billy Boyd sings The Steward of Gondor, preceded by a long introduction featuring a traditional flute.<br />But perhaps the biggest difference between the two soundtrack CDs, other than the Oscar gathering dust on Howard Shore's mantle, is the overall tone.

B00007LTIL|5.0|\\"It's the same story the crow told me it's the only one he knows...\\" Yes, we have heard the story. You know...how the Grateful Dead were great in concert, but for reasons unknown, were never able to \\"catch lightning in a bottle\\", when it came time to going into the studio to produce an album. Well folks, that's a myth that's disproven with this remastered, re-release (w/ bonus tracks) of the Dead's 1970 classic, \\"American Beauty\\". This is a band, who never cared to be pigeonholed in one musical catagory or genre. As the 1960's ended the record industry pretty much had the them pegged as an experimental psychedelic band, who couldn't make much of a dent in the charts.But just when you zig the G.D. would zag and do the unexpected. They refined and simplified both their song writing craft and their vocal performances, creating a beautiful collection of rock, country, folk & blues songs, that were new and modern, but at the same time felt like they wouldn't be out of place being played a half century earlier.The album starts on a high note of perfection with \\"Box of Rain\\", bassist, Phil Lesh's ode to his dying father. This is a tuneful, powerful song, which is just an outpouring of emotion.The album's high quality of song writing and performances continues all the way to the last note of the last song, the band's autobiographical rocker, \\"Truckin\\". Other highlights include tunes such as \\"Friend of the Devil\\", the lively country rocker, \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" and the zen like sing-along, \\"Ripple\\". But to be truthful, there isn't a clunker in the bunch.The songs seem to easily work together creating an almost historical/emotional portrait of the American spirit and psyche. Many of these songs would become standards in the band's concert repertoire, going through substantial changes over the next twenty-five years. But there is just something 'perfect' about their original incarnations captured here. I wouldn't change a note! This classic has now been re-released with the sound remastered. Any sonic mud has been removed and you can now hear each guitar, mandolin and vocal with the utmost clarity (I'm in stereo geek heaven!) The live bonus tracks are great, but not essential, though I did really enjoy the unlisted \\"Grateful Duck/Nixon\\" radio ad track, which perfectly captures the spirit of the band and the early 1970's era. This album is as close to perfection as the Grateful Dead were ever able to achieve in a studio setting. Yes,\\"lightning was captured in the bottle\\".

B00005JN1L|3.0|Given that Johnny Depp is in Secret Window, I knew I was going to see this movie. Maleficent is a big Depp fan. Fortunately, I got something out of the deal - Maleficent agreed to see Dawn of the Dead without me even asking her. Did I mention I love my wife?<br />Anyway, I did not love this movie. In an amusing twist, not only did I not enjoy Secret Window, I wasn't paying attention enough to catch onto the plot twist. Maleficent did - in fact, she said she saw the whole plot twist coming a mile away. In my defense, I feel the movie was boring enough such that I wasn't looking that hard for the Plot Twist .<br />That, and the fact that there were two people in the movie theater who were possibly drunk, definitely movie hopping, and loudly whispering to each other throughout every potentially scary scene.<br />\\"He's in the closet,\\" the female would loudly whisper, \\"I just know he's going to jump out and stab her.\\"<br />\\"No he's not,\\" says the male, \\"he's under the bed...\\"<br />I'm not sure if it's better or worse that they were wrong on EVERY count. Still, it completely distracted me from watching the movie. I seem to have this problem a lot (for more amusing anecdotes, see the throw down after Dawn of the Dead). But I digress.<br />Secret Window is standard Stephen King fare. Good ole' Mr. King is an expert at taking an everyday domestic situation and turning it into a supernatural, awful occurrence. Indeed, the events that take place are awful enough - the supernatural just speeds up the horrible process. And that process is the complete destruction of a human being.<br />The Stephen King Destruction Machine is in full effect in Secret Window. The main character, Mort Rainey (played with a multitude of character tics by the ever-experimenting Depp), is going through a divorce after his wife had a miscarriage. Worse, her caught her in bed with another man, a man she continues to date and who lives in \\"their\\" house. In fact, Secret Window has all the makings of an episode out of Cops, complete with wife beating, lawsuits, alcohol abuse, and houses being set on fire.<br />Secret Window only bothers with the third and fourth elements, the other two being curiously repressed. Indeed, much of Secret Window is bizarrely out of place. Mort lives in a cabin where there were happier times. In that cabin is a secret window. It's also where he goes to think. Let's call it the \\"secret window to his mind.\\"<br />But Mort's not thinking. He's not writing. He's got the worst case of writer's block ever. Mostly, he sits on the couch and occasionally answers an old phone.<br />Why doesn't Mort have a cell phone? Well, cause that would screw up the plot in about five minutes. Much of the movie feels outdated without explanation for why it doesn't deal with modern plot elements (but Mort's laptop is definitely modern).<br />Secret Window has some beautiful symbolism, symbolism entirely on the part of the director and having very little to do with Mr. King. We flow through a mirror at one point of the film and then out again - that's Very Important. Indeed, if anything, Secret Window ranges from hackneyed to over-the-top-obvious.<br />Without giving away the plot, I can confidently say that Session 9 explored the same human depths of depravity, the same loss of self, the same murder mystery, only it did it much better. Session 9 kicks this movies ass.<br />Ultimately, there's nothing GREAT about this movie, and that's a shame. It's always fun to see Johnny act (act, Johnny, act!) but his performance is but glossy paint on a rickety old movie that King built.episode out of Cops, complete with wife beating, lawsuits, alcohol abuse, and houses being set on fire.<br />Secret Window only bothers with the third and fourth elements, the other two being curiously repressed.

B0001ENY6M|5.0|I haven't seen Mel Gibson's film, and I'll level with you all -- the kind of bloodthirsty carnage featured in the film is not something I'm emotionally able to bear.  That being said, I still wanted to partake in the film's power, and I thought that hearing the soundtrack would be a good way to do so, and I belive I was right.<br />I am a huge Peter Gabriel fan and, yes, I can hear some similarity with his prior soundtrack.  However, Gabriel's soundtrack feels different.  Gabriel's &quot;Passion&quot; frequently felt optimistic, due in part to the broader scope of &quot;Last Temptation of Christ&quot;.<br />Debney's &quot;Passion&quot; score has a dreary tenseness you would expect, given the narrower viewpoint Gibson's film is taking.  Nonetheless, I find Debney's score more powerful and majestic.  As epic as the film.<br />I was completely taken aback when I heard the music for the flagellation -- the violent, horrific centerpiece of the film.  Here the music conveys the message that the visual violence is intending -- a sublime message of compassion, sacrifice, and love.  Soon, the music brings you to the crucifixion... the raising of the cross... and the resurrection.  I am moved to tears every time I hear this soundtrack...<br />... very moved, and I haven't even seen the movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a modern-day fairy-tale of a simple city-girl, in a seemingly idyllic backdrop, which actually is ruffled is a lot of ways, due to its rather `disturbed' characters, whose lives, while this beady-eyed waitress tries to solve, finds herself in a similar situation, where she herself ends up needing some help.<br />AMELIE can be considered a story of stories, tied together by just a single link, in the form of a girl called Amilie. Living in her own shell, this girl discovers the Samaritan in her, when she successfully tracks down and gives the previous occupant of her apartment, a box containing objects of his childhood playthings that she accidentally finds in her house, and brings out the tears of joy in his eyes, as he reminisces his days of childhood, watching and feeling the contents of the box. This experience overwhelms her, and she decides that she would now on, do whatever she could, to straighten other people's lives, and herein lies the stories, which make the story of the movie.<br />The movie is made up of bits and pieces, showing the rather weird nature of the various people, that Amilie tries to help. The magic of the movie lies in this aspect of how beautifully each character is depicted, with some handicap or the other disturbing their lives, which this lonely but good-willed girl tries to fix. Be it the `obsessed' neighbor, who is more than happy to read out letters from her deal husband, or the painter, who is so touchy about how names are pronounced, or the bullying vegetable-vendor, always belittling his hapless assistant, or the loveless boyfriend and the loveless hotel-waitresses, or the young man, who sifts for torn photographs of people, and reassembles and sticks them in the album that he maintains of reassembled photos of people he doesn't even know, or even Amilie's own father, who is obsessed with his ceramic gnome, each one of them is so carefully and delicately defined, that it overshadows the ambiguity in the story, which is what it intends to do, in the first place.<br />Though the story has a naïve fairy-tale-like feel to it, it actually turns out otherwise, by its messed up characters. Hence, the movie, far from being a sappy and drab tale of feel-good, is actually quite an interesting take on the most unusual and uncanny facets of the human nature. Moreover, the slick cinematography and the music-video like feel of the movie, coupled with the swanky voice-over comments make it not only a visually splendid movie, but also an exciting joyride, with a lot of areas worth pondering on.<br />AMILIE has a mischievous undertone, with a visually pleasing and amiable exterior. When one sees beyond the pleasing epidermis of the movie, it provides for interesting food for thought, when it comes to analyzing the bizarre characters in it. For its glossy appearance, or for its underlying unapparent starkness, or for its feel-good aura, or just for its wacky imagination, AMILIE is an entertainer with brains and brawns.
0671891634|5.0|Lynch's success comes not from his complex algorithms and estoric financial modeling, but from opening his eyes to the world and noticing good businesses.<br />His success at Magellan is attributed to his ability to find good companies, at reasonable valuations, and be patient enough to watch them climb.<br />This book is much more specific than his other release.  Here, he provides detailed accounts of stock picking strategy, including how to choose from different stocks, when to buy, when to buy more and when to sell.<br />This is a quick read, but there is a huge amount of information that the average investor can use to their benefit.
B000002KBH|5.0|I'm now 21, and this has been my favorite album since I was 13. Definitly something worth having.
0553801546|5.0|Loved it.  Just finished it today.  Savor this book as it's probably the last time we'll see Fitz and the Fool.  Robin is amazing.  She still manages to surprise us with characters we know very well after the 5 preceeding books.  I cheered and cried while reading this - which hardly ever happens.<br />I've been reading fantasy for over 25 years and have to say this is one of the top 10 series I've read, possibly top 5.  These characters stick with you, because you experience so much with them.
0140277447|5.0|What was written in the history book? What really happened there? What is history anyway?<br />At one side: 10 years investigation; photoes; eye witnesses from Japan, German, China, US, and other countries; the facts of statistics published back in 30's and 40's.<br />At the other side: &quot;I heard it never happened.&quot; &quot;It was written in my history book.&quot; &quot;This is not what I was told.&quot;<br />Take your judgement.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, especially WWII history regarding Japanese, Japanese army, and Japanese goverment.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I was searching on the internet for a new CD. I came across this Cd and read the reviews, which seemed to be pretty good. I popped it in my CD player. The very first song, Waking the Fallen, was awfully strange. It has kind of spacey atmosphere and the singer singing in this detached voice. After that comes the hit Unholy confessions, which has a great video. Not really my favorite though. The 3rd song starts out with an amazing drumbeat, fastest drumming I ever heard. My favorite track number 7, is called Second Heartbeat. It's a seven minute long masterpiece, very fast with great screaming and melodic singing. The lyrics are great except for 1 or 2 which are pretty emo-y. It's very long,almost seventy minutes. My only complaint is that the guitars sound pretty similar, and there are no drum solos from their amazing drummer. All in all A7X is an amazing band that could go far with their fast beats and metal hardcore sound.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Although this DVD is really a big hit,my comment is very simple...Identity win.<BR>I find that this kind of pyscho movies are really intresting in term of schoking moments that you get right before the titles and that was my main reason when i saw this movie.Actually it did not disappointed me at all but still there is a question mark about it.... <br />Butterfly effect is one of the film that you will really enjoy seeing it, but does not leave that deep impressons deep down your soul.U will tend to forget it after a while and maybe do not talk about it or recommended to a freind...and that's remain my question..why does this happen ??? athough it is a great movie...
B0001AP12G|5.0|Can a producer succeed as a rapper?  The music industry has laughed at producers becoming mediocre rappers.  Timbaland should stick to making beats, and Jermaine Dupri shouldn't pick up a microphone unless Da Brat or Bow Wow is on the track with him.  However, the Roc-a-fella member Kanye West is the exception.  <BR> Kanye West has produced a number of smash hits that range from Alicia Keys' \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" to Talib Kweli's \\"Get By.\\"  West captures the essence of hip-hop and gives you \\"Tribe Quest flashbacks.\\"  Kanye West does a track that is similar to Common's song \\"I used to love her.\\"  He creates a metaphorical ballad in which he depicts his hometown Chicago.  He is also credited at being one of Chicago's best underground MC's after battling Common on the radio in 1995.  In addition, this poetic soul is an exceptional lyricist. His wordplay is above par with such lines as \\"Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\\"  <BR> So how will this hit producer fend with his \\"College Dropout,\\" his 21 track debut album?  It's a given that all of the beats on his album are going to be great, but what about Kanye West as a rapper?<BR> \\"Slow Jamz,\\" featuring fellow Chicago natives Jamie Foxx and Twista, put West on the map.  His multi-syllabic flow hypnotizes its listeners.  West also finds the space to incorporate some humorous lines like, \\"She be grabbin', calling me Biggie like Shine homes\\" and \\"She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/Got a dark-skinned look like Michael Jackson.\\"  West song \\"The New Workout Plan\\" also reveals his comic personality.   <BR> Surprisingly, Twista, like he usually does, does not outshine Kanye West on the song.  Meshing so well together, Twista and West did another track on Twista's album \\"Kamikaze.\\"  Other guess appearance help make \\"College Dropout\\" a top album.  In the \\"Never let me down,\\" featuring Jay-Z, S-dot-Carter makes it a solid track.  Kanye West's verse is also above average as he raps, \\"I can't complain what an accident did to my left eye/ `cause look what an accident did to Left Eye/ First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die?\\" Fellow Chicagoans Common and Ludacris are also featured on the album.  Many other artist appear on West's tracks.  <BR> An aspect of West's album that makes it so appealing is his openness to depict his personal life.  One of my favorite tracks on the album is \\"Live Through The Wire.\\"  The beat is soulful and fits his lyrics.  Kanye West illustrates his tragic car accident that he recovered from.  Along with revealing his story-telling skills, he still shows he is one of the industry's top lyricists rapping \\"She [West's girlfriend] was with before the deal, she been trying mine/She a delta so she been throwing that Dynasty Sign.\\"  In addition to this personal track, West also add the track \\"Family Business\\" on the album, which literally reveals his family business.  He exposes to the world memories of his relatives, both the good and unpleasant ones.  <BR> Although appealing to mainstream rap with tracks like \\"Slow Jamz\\" , West does take his stand on political and social issues.  In his song \\"Jesus Walks,\\" West questions why its impossible for artist like himself to rap about religion and be successful in the music industry.  \\"Two Words,\\" featuring Mos Def and Freeway, West and his fellow MC's depict the communities they grew up in.  West raps \\"I basically know now/that we're racially profiled\\" over a beat that samples Michael Jackson's voice.  <br /> My favorite track on \\"College Dropout\\" is \\"Spaceships.\\"  On chorus, West harmonizes \\"I've been working the slave shift/And I ain't made (--it)/I wish I could buy me a spaceship/and fly.../past the sky.../\\"  West takes his listeners in his personal experience of being exploited as a Black worker at the gap and then turning to rap as his means of living.<BR> In his song \\"All Falls Down,\\" speaks on the affects of commercialism on the Black community.  Aside from \\"Jesus Walks\\" this is West's most powerful song.  He raps about a Black female that attends college.  He says she \\"couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis (a-Lexus).\\"  He is \\"a single Black female/addicted to retail.\\"  At the end of his second verse, West says, \\"We tryin' to buy back our forty acres/and for that paper/look how low we'll stoop/even if you in a Benz, you still a n----- in a coop (coupe).\\"  In his last verse, West raps \\"They make use hate ourself/and love they wealth.\\"  <BR> In his song \\"School Spirit,\\" West alludes to a number of sororities and fraternities to depicts his college experience.  This is a very creative track that is a microcosm to West as an artist.  In this track, West's flow is on-point, the beat reveals his usual production skills, the lyrics are creative, and their are some personal lines in the song.<BR> To quote Mos Def, Kanye West is \\"the future of hip-hop.\\"  Although I bought his c.d. for $5 from a bootlegger at Avondale train station, I am planning on buying the album.  This is truly a great album that I will keep in my c.d players for months.  \\"Come over in your coo' whip,\\" and we'll go to Target to buy the album.  Support true hip-hop artists!
B000066NW0|5.0|it's soooo freakin hilarious to me how ppl can talk so much trash on how they can do a better job then avril, but yet have no talent to get out and prove that to anyone. she may not be hardcore punk but maybe those aren't her intentions!!! whatever!! at least she tried and she made it!!! and yah she is coming out with a new cd. she proved all of you bad asses wrong! that she still has the ability to do good things and watch, this cd will be CRAZY and sell millions...i listen to punk bands and i'm not all &quot;HARDCORE PUNK&quot; but WHO CARES... there's no law saying that i have to be or that i have to listen to a particular style of music etc. those that talk crap are just jealous because she made it and you DIDN'T. accept it or change it, but don't bring others down because you're miserable!!!
0385336810|4.0|I loved the shopaholic books by Kinsella so my friend let my borrow Can you keep a secret I was all for it. At first the book was a little boring in the beginning but towards the middle it started to pick up. It was really funny and I liked most of the ending except like the last 1 1/2 pages. But you should definitly read it anyway!
B0001IN07Q|2.0|First off let me say that I am a Michael Buble' fan. I have seen him perform live and find him to be every bit as talented and personable as the 'Rat Packers' he is trying to emulate. His full length debut was superb (the work of music icon David Foster) and his Christmas EP, while way too short, was very good as well. I put no credence into the pair of soundtrack albums featuring MB, although there are a couple tracks, particularly on &quot;Down With Love&quot;, worth grabbing, leaving only this CD/DVD combo to review. <br />With that, this was an obvious attempt to capitalize on MB's recent rise to fame and put some additional $$$ in the coffers. While the two studio tracks on the CD are worthy efforts, the live recording is absolutely horrible. The quality is so poor, at times you can almost hear the horn blasts of cars going by in the tunnel. Michael's obvious talent and passion for this kind of music shines through for the most part, but the disc is almost unlistenable, save for the first two tracks. <br />As for the DVD, the sound quality is a little better but the annoying edit job makes it, well annoying. Would much rather have seen a more traditional 90 minute (at least) concert with MB and his outstanding band taking the crowd, both in person as well as at home, on a musical journey 60 years in the making. <br />I eagerly await his next release as like I said, I'm a fan. And hopefully that effort will catapult him into the upper stratosphere where performers with his level of talent belong.
0312995423|5.0|But unfortunatly, slightly inaccurate.  I loved this book as much a Da Vinci Code, and was THRILLED by the reference to the Navel Base in Rota (I live on the base) but I was annoyied but several inaccuracies, especially one:  Dan Brown spent a lot of time talking about the steps of the Giralda in Sevilla, but there's one problem: the Giralda has ramps.  No steps.  It was built by Moors (who were Muslim) and they built in easy-to-climb ramps that made it possible to drive donkeys to the top every day for prayer call.  Over all, a very good read, though slightly less researched than others.  If your going to obsess and let inaccuracies ruin your read, then don't read it.
0786188375|4.0|This book would have made a great movie on its own.  They borrowed the titles from two books.  They should have stuck with the series verbatem.<br />The book kept my interest.  Even with the very technical descriptions of the sailing terms it was hard to stop listening.  The heavy verbose english takes about 1 disk to get used to, but once you do, you will sink right into it.<br />Highly recommended for sailors or historians.
B000002KKK|5.0|This is super material and performances but the CD is too short.  I would have liked to see at least a couple of bonus tracks or live cuts.
B00003CXDB|2.0|When people think of &quot;Wall Street&quot; they think about the classic line &quot;Greed, for lack of better word... is good,&quot; and they remember a pretty good movie. I'm here to tell you that it wasn't.  Instead of making am movie about the exciting and dramatic Wall Street world in the 80's, Oliver Stone shamelessly makes a flat movie about a criminal. <br />The only reason why I give this movie two stars it contains some of the great \\"all time\\" movie lines including:<br />&quot;Money's only something you need in case you don't die tomorrow.&quot;<br />&quot;You're walking around blind without a cane, pal. A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place.&quot;<br />But as a whole, I find the movie to be a cheap attack on capitalism. The truth of the matter is that the real life stories of M&amp;A and corporate takeovers were exciting enough. Stone had no reason to louse up a good concept with a convoluted plot about that includes every financial headline of the 1980's (insider trading, offshore banking, junk bonds, and corporate takeovers).  If you are interested an exciting and engaging account of Wall Street in the 80's, read Michael Lewis classic LIAR'S POKER.
B000000W5P|5.0|You have to give them their props with this one.  As some other reviewers point out, it is great from start to finish.  Agreed, and I particularly like all the information for each song as to who played what.  Keith is quite a bass player, eh?  Great cover too that would be hard to emulate on a CD.  In fact, that's what I really miss about LPs, the big beautiful artwork.  One song in particular that I like alot more now that I'm older is &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, great song.  They played this in concert too when I saw them at Gillette, that really surpized me.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Haven't we heard this tune before? Rap, screams, guitar riffs so dreadful they are incomprehensible, and the drumming, terrible. The lyrics are plain and sound like a 15 year old would like them, but judging by all the ridiculous five star reviews on here, I guess that is the case. Every song seems to be about the same thing and the songs seem to lack the conciseness of hybrid theory, also the production is a step down from hybrid theory. Hybrid theory was a breath of life into a dying genre, this is just noise, pure noise, the mere sound is stale, i was really looking forward to this album. Linkin Park jumped on the rap metal train to late, they won't last long, but then again, i guess thats the only time they have a chance to be big, when the other monsters of the genre are taking the hint and evolving or fading away. take the hint LP, go away.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Great one here to pick up.  This is the transition album Jones-Taylor and is one of their greatest works.  Probably not as good as Sticky Fingers but far better than Beggar's Banquet and Exile.
0385504209|1.0|This is pure pulp, recycled trash and soft-headed conspiration theories. Take a spoonful of a guide to the Louvre, half a cup from of table book about Da Vinci's work, and add six chapters from &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; by H Lincoln, M Baigent and R Leigh from 1982. A Harvard scholar who, even for a second, believes in this conspiracy - Jesus never died on the cross, instead he married and had children with Mary of Magdalene; the Merovingian dynasty (cloaked in the dark ages) could trace its origin back to this union; guarding this SECRET was the true mission of the Knight's Templars and the ficticious secret society Priory of Zion - belongs in a loony bin. This hoax is recycled trash, and the author is laughing all the way to the bank. Don't waste your money.
B000000W5N|5.0|This one is a masterpiece.  There are NO filler songs at all on this album.  Two particular songs that really grow on you are Sway and I got The Blues.  Mick Taylor is phenomenal.  They lost gold when they lost him.  I also recommend Between The Buttons and Aftermath from the Jones era.  Beggar's Banquet is mysteriously overrated.
074325144X|5.0|I bought this book because my wife does tai chi, and I'm a runner. For three years I've run 20 miles a week, with lots of knee pain, so that I always had to ice my knees after a run, and wore braces on each knee. I did all of the leg lifts and workouts to increase my strength. This helped, but not much. Then I read Chi Running, and now I have no more knee pain. I read the book in one sitting, and have reread several passages many times. I've changed my form, and presto, no more knee pain. I feel like a kid again.<br />Getting confortable with the book's method of &quot;leaning&quot; while running takes some time. I still feel a little akward, now 10 days into this method. But believe me, this book has changed my running life. The text is clearly written, and the photographs are helpful.
B000000W5F|3.0|This is a middle of the road album from the Stones.  Waiting On A Friend, Start Me Up, Black Limousine, and Little T&amp;A are noteworthy.  The rest are lackluster efforts.  These guys can do better.  How can you give this 5 stars when there exists an album entitled &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;?  'Nuff said.
0385510438|4.0|I was a tad disapointed by this effort by Grisham, though I would say it is a great read. He has again managed to share a story of common people, of the human condition, of less-than-perfect characters and for that his story moves and flows. But, it lacks the rythmic suspense of some of his other bestsellers. There are no offshore accounts in the Caymans, no greedy businessmen or shady lawyers. In a sense, everyone in this small town life is flawed, but noble in a way. <br />I enjoyed The Last Juror for humor and storytelling, but I was put off by Grisham's unusual amount of language and sexuality. We all know he can tell a good story without having to reach down to the levels he did in The Last Juror. <br />All that being said, I would say that The Last Juror is worth reading, but it is definitely not the heart-pounding thriller you've come to expect. It is definetly not as good as the majority of his other books.
B00006AW2J|3.0|Slightly.  I admit it is decidedly better than Satanic but evidently weaker than Let It Bleed.  I like the old LP Cover Better, it's much classier (The one where they copy The Beatles white Album cover, except they use script - Whoopdedoo).  They always copied the Beatles in some way (Satanic cover), use of sitar(Paint It, Black), Let It Be-answer-Let It Bleed, etc etc,,,,too much to metion here.  It is the only thing I don't like about The Stones, Jagger's relentless jealosy towards the genius of the Beatles.  He hated being number 2.  People do not recognize this fact enough.  They always kept a close eye on what The Beatles were doing so they could plan their next artistic move and follow their lead.  I hope he is reading this review too.
B00005ASGG|5.0|The other day, in a conversation with my brother, he made mention that the underlying theme of this movie was a polemic against big business.  Viewing the film again, I can see his point but I came away with quite another conclusion.  Although unintentional, this movie demonstrates what America's response to our war in terror should be. <br />Think about it, the idealist Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Steward) comes west to make his fortune and to help civilize the frontier.  Before he even arrives in Shinbone, his stagecoach is robbed and the outlaw Liberty Valance mercilessly beats him.  Not only is Ransom beaten, but Stoddard's law books, which represent civilization,  are torn and thrown into the dust.  Ransom determines to find justice through the law, but to no avail.  <br />Throughout the movie, Stoddard endeavors to bring civilization to Shinbone, whether by opening his law practice, teaching people how to read, or accepting nomination for public office.  In the end, however, it is not the law books nor the Sheriff that ends Libertys reign of terror, but Stoddard who must abandon his law books and pick up a gun.  Of course, we know that it was actually Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) who shot Liberty Valance.  <br />Now about our war on terror.  The liberal left has viewed the war on terror as a legal issue to be resolved through the court system.  Preemptive strikes against terrorism are considered by the left as brutish Republican behavior.  Evidence must be gathered, the terrorist rights must be protected, and courts of law must adjudicate the issues.   But, terrorist, like Liberty Valance are evil.  They feed off of the fear of others.  Until we put the law books down, and pick up our .45s, terror will reign.  Civilization was brought to Shinbone only after Liberty Valance lay dead in the street, his body riddled with bullets.   The war of terror will only be won by the West when those who perpetrate it are killed.  It is not a nice thought, but a necessary one.
0380002930|5.0|This is a timeless and much-loved novel of leadership, struggle, and adventure!  A group of individuals, dissatisfied with the government of their \\"country,\\" and receiving prophesies of its doom, decide to leave and start a colony elsewhere.  The individuals, of course, are rabbits, who are confronted with all the dangers of the \\"elil.\\"  The \\"elil\\" means their enemies, known to the rabbits as \\"the thousand\\" meaning the infinite number of enemies, i.e. foxes, hawks, etc. who prey on rabbits.  The most dangerous elil, of course, is man.<br />This is a wonderful novel that discusses the nature of leadership, teamwork, individual achievement, and struggle, as the protagonists seek to set up a new colony free of dangers from man as well as \\"elil\\" and even other hostile rabbits.  Their leader, Hazel, is neither the strongest (Bigwig is that) or the cleverest (Blackberry is that) but nevertheless we come to see why he is the emergent leader to whom the others look for guidance and inspiration.  This is a fine study in leadership.<br />The novel never loses sight of its main objective, which is to entertain.  This is a fascinating, well-written tale.  The storyline moves at a brisk pace, punctuated with interesting episodes of struggle and insight, which always add to, rather than distract from, the main plot.  The reader will come to care deeply about the various individual characters of the novel, cheer them in success and root for them in adversity.  Adams' prose is superb.  This book is a pleasure to read.<br />This is a novel that adults will appreciate and young readers will love.  It is indeed written at an adult level, but Adams' writing is so clear and crisp that younger readers will also appreciate and enjoy the novel.  This is a timeless and classic novel that belongs in one's personal library and which most readers will enjoy reading repeatedly from time to time, and share with the younger readers in the family.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Brilliant collection that's as good as the studio albums.  Unlike the famous albums, which sometimes sound over-produced, there's a rawness and freshness to all this which lets the songs speak.
0380018179|5.0|This is a truly a great and classic novel.  I do not bestow these oft-overused adjectives lightly.  This is a story of deep, rich, and forbidden love, betrayal, tragedy, and ambition.  This is a truly wonderful story set primarily in Australia, circa 1915 and then spanning several generations to the post World War II era.  McCullough writes a sprawling story which primarily centers on the forbidden love between an extraordinary woman and a good but ambitious priest.<br />This is the story of the Cleary family, originally from Ireland, who emigrate first to New Zealand, and early on, to Australia.  The young Cleary daughter, Meggie, falls in love with the local Catholic priest, Ralph de Briccasart, who is a good and ambitious man who certainly does nothing to encourage this love, but who certainly returns it as he regards Meggie as the daughter he can never have.  As Meggie matures, he comes to regard her in a more romantic way.  A great struggle arises between this love on the one hand (&quot;the forbidden rose&quot;) and his ambition to become a Cardinal or perhaps more, on the other.<br />There is much, much, more to the story than this, however.  The novel transports the reader to Australia, and makes that country a real place to those of us who have never been there.  This is also the story of the struggles of the Cleary family, as they battle with, and come to love, the rich outback country of Australia.  This is an extraordinarily authentic and moving story that any review (or at least this one) can only fail to do justice.<br />McCullough's prose is simply outstanding, and her characters crackle with realism--they become utterly real people and the reader will become swept away with this wonderful story.  The storyline never drags, and at no point does this novel ever fail to completely capture the reader's attention.  This novel is not only a classic; it is a ripping good read!  If you have not yet enjoyed this novel, you are in for a wonderful reading experience.erience.
B000002LKF|5.0|Best album I own (and I've got quite a few!) Not sure where to start. The music is sublime, the lyrics are brilliant and no matter how you feel it makes you feel better. I like most of Paul's Simon's stuff, but it all pales beside this - a masterpiece of music, mood and Paul Simon's always-perceptive words.

B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II is such a great set of songs. In my opinion the best songs here sre &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;Living Loving Maid&quot;, and &quot;Ramble On.&quot; These cd is classic Led Zeppelin and it is one of their best cds, probably just behind Led Zeppelin IV.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Ok, first of all, anybody who likes this cd, click &quot;no&quot; on the helpful voting thing and then kiss my ass. This cd blows. It's so unoriginal and boring; most of the songs sound extremly similar to each other or to something on &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. The entire album screams SELLOUT, and they're releasing singles like nothing right now. I admit, I liked Hybrid Theory, it was hard and catchy, and, even a little bit (not much, though) original. Overall, I thought it was a decent album.  I don't what the hell these guys were talking about on MTV when they were saying that their music was &quot;evolving&quot; on the new album.  It's the same stuff, goddammit! Actually it's worse, so I have to give them props for that. I can't believe I wasted 14 bucks on this crap! Spend your money elsewhere.
B00008H2LB|1.0|I hesitate to write a review for a cd such as this with already 1000+ reviews written, but I just needed to add my two cents. <br />For starters, I can see how the average person might like this stuff. It doesn't take much effort to get into and everything is played safe. Nothing too complex, nothing too challenging, but enough energy to keep a listener engaged. That's why it's so popular. What people fail to realize is there is absolutely NO long term redeeming value to this cd. I guarantee about 80% of the people who call this album genious now will forget about this album in 5 years. There is nothing to keep a person coming back to it. The guitar work is childs play - simple power chords with no complex rythms or arrangements, drum machine-quality drums, and manufactured \\"psuedo-anger\\". Anyone who thinks about buying this should deeply reconsider, especially since this stuff is played on the radio constantly. CD's are too expensive to be wasted on something that'll be forgotten in 6 months.
B0000DD7LC|2.0|This is not the album I was expecting to hear.  The song are boring, and she sound lifeless.  Save your money.
B00005JM0B|4.0|The concept remains the same.  The T-101 model terminator (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) comes from the future to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl), the future savior of the human race, from a more advanced model (Kristanna Loken) sent to destroy him.  This time, it happens simultaneously with the long-dreaded ascendance of Skynet and the revolt of the machines.<br />T3 lacks the freshness of T1 and the intelligence and human drama of T2, but it certainly delivers as a special-effects laden thrill ride.  It also benefits from some genuinely unexpected events toward the end of the film.  Very entertaining.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus has been one of my favorite bands for quite some time.  The way they change their sound for every album intrigues me to no end.  For Morning View they have mellowed quite a bit from the hard rocking of previous albums.  Morning view is dirven more by DJ Kilmore than their other records.  The songs on this album blend so well together that it's as if they were written to be in that order.  Branden Boyd's lyrics are some of the most poetic and meaningful out there.  Incubus' sound has matured greatly since the days of Fungus Amongus.  My personal favorite song on the album is Aqueous Transmission.  With its mellow Asian string motif it is one of the most beautiful songs in modern pop music.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.  It is well worth it.
0780626966|5.0|Contains all 7 nightmare on elm street films plus an eighth disk called the Nightmare series Encyclopedia, its really cool and has facts about all 7 nightmare films but its like a game and you have to get through the maze or Labryinth and find all the clues to unlock certain things. A documentary exploring the labryinth, and dvd rom content and you can save freddy to your computer screen and when you push button he pops up-Has cool packaging with freddy on the cover and comes with 3-d glasses for the freddy's dead film. My only complaint is the snap cases the dvd's are in. They fingerprint easy and sometimes they are harder to shut or snap close.

0679428895|2.0|Robert Harris' novel, POMPEII, is an instructive book. The reader learns about the Roman aqueduct system and about erupting volcanos. She also learns about the effects of the exploding volcano on the town of Pompeii and the people in it. The reader is also learns how people lived in 79 AD, what they wore, what they ate, their customs and religious observations. It's all very instructive and....(yawn)....very boring.<br />Unfortunately, the novel framework around all this research is weak and falls apart long before Vesuvious blows its top.<br />Perhaps the worst transgressions in POMPEII are the cartoonish characters, cardboard thin and sterotypical. Hate that, don't you?<br />There is the evil contractor, the learned philospoher, the upright, honest hero, the innocent maiden in distress.<br />Give me a break!<br />There is very little action in the book except running around trying to find the leak in the aqueduct or dodging falling rock fropm the eruption. The best action takes place when a hapless slave was fed to a nasty eel as punishment for killing some fish.<br />There aren't even any (...) scenes in libidinous ancient Rome!<br />I think this was a good idea and there is a good novel in in all this somewhere. Robert Harris just didn't manage to find it this time.<br />But I learned a lot and there is something to be said for that: two volcanos out of five.
B00015HVI8|5.0|Not being a Showtime subscriber, I had never heard of Stargate until a couple of years ago.  While channel surfing I came across reruns a few times. Since I love good Sci-fi, I watched a few minutes each time. I was totally unable to understand what was going on, it always seemed as though I was coming in at the middle of the story without knowing who, what, where or when. Fortunately, my son started watching some of the earlier shows and began to get hooked.  He asked me to get the original movie and year one of the series, which had just come out.  Knowing him to be a young man with good taste, I bought them the next day.  He and I started watching, then my daughter and finally my wife.  Within 2 weeks we were all hopelessly addicted.  We since have purchased and watched years 2 through 6 and watched year 7 on the Si-Fi channel.  I'm the type of person that sees a movie and doesn't want to see it again for about 10 years, but this program I can watch over and over again.  I said it is the BEST TV series ever and it is, nothing else even comes close.  I don't mean just the best science fiction series, I mean the best series of any genre.  It has a perfect mix of action, drama and comedy.  The character development has been excellent, you begin to feel you know Jack, Sam, Daniel, T'ealc and all the characters personally.  The plot lines have evolved throughout the series, continually building and developing.  That is why I couldn't pick up on the show and appreciate it in the beginning.  In our instant society few if any other programs have any real depth.  I have begun to evangelize my friends, offering to lend them my DVD's.  So far everyone who has taken me up on my offer has become equally hooked. I hope that this show runs forever and that the rumors about season 8 being the last are false.  I'm also hopeful that Stargate Atlantis will be of the same quality. If it is a tenth as good, it will be the second best program on TV.

0385504209|3.0|Maybe this is the reason why I don&iexcl;¯t read suspense novels. I can&iexcl;¯t take the suspense!<br />Ok, all right, lame jokes aside&iexcl;­<br />So the book then&iexcl;­ It&iexcl;¯s fascinating, certainly, but well written? Hmm&iexcl;­<br />To tell you the truth, I think as long as the writing&iexcl;¯s coherent it&iexcl;¯ll still be an intriguing read simply because of the subject matter ¨C Mary and Jesus sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g&iexcl;­? The writing&iexcl;¯s OK, but just that I&iexcl;¯ve read so many better written books.<br />While I know a mystery novel needs to incorporate some cliff-hangers, it gets a bit silly after a while and it lost its power to be gripping, especially if the author wants to end every chapter with one and also had the bright idea to divide the book into almost a hundred chapters.<br />I found this book to be extremely &iexcl;®well rehearsed&iexcl;¯, particularly during flash backs of Langdon teaching at Harvard, it doesn&iexcl;¯t get any more clich¨¦d than this ¨C the dumb jocks, the &iexcl;®edgy&iexcl;¯ comebacks, the silence and wonder in the room after a revelation&iexcl;­ it&iexcl;¯s so over the top it&iexcl;¯s funny. Well&iexcl;­ I laughed anyway.<br />I doubt I&iexcl;¯ll ever read this book again simply because once you&iexcl;¯ve finished it, what&iexcl;¯s the point in re-reading it? It&iexcl;¯s much more likely you&iexcl;¯ll want to investigate all the &iexcl;®facts&iexcl;¯ or imagine what would happen if it were real.

B000000H5K|5.0|This album despite the fact that it kinda slows down a little bit doesn't mean it lacks the fury &amp; carnage of Sepultura.

A must have for all metalheads, this marks the end of the golden days of Sepultura because of Max's departure from the group.
0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club looks at the complex relationships between mothers and daughters.  Amy Tan tells the stories of four Chinese women tring to raise American daughters.  Each mother wants her daughter to have all of the values of Chinese women with the freedoms of American women.  The individual stroies of each woman is not only interesting, but gives insite as to how she raises her daughter. I highly recomend this book because of heart wrenching stories that each mother tells about her childhood.  I also enjoy the way her adult daughter relates the srory to her own relationship with her mother.
0446677450|5.0|People who have given the book a 1-star review make you wonder if they even got past the table of contents. They are dissappointed that Kiyosaki didn't tell them the &quot;how-to's&quot; or detailed step-by-step process to get rich. Well, even the authors prefaced the book by saying the book is NOT a &quot;how-to-get-rich&quot; book. It's more of a guide on HOW TO THINK ABOUT THINGS (money and wealth) and PERCEPTION ABOUT THINGS.<br />Heck, Kiyosaki even says in his book to buy the &quot;how-to&quot; books from other authors. Without clarity on how to think about these things, how are you going to spot the &quot;gimmicks&quot; from the real rewarding schemes?<br />There was one reviewer who said he'd rather read Peter Lynch's book. Yeah, Kiyosaki recommended the same thing in his book. Read Peter Lynch--definitely a good guide in investment. Actually, in the book, Kiyosaki recommends other people/books to read upon.<br />You are reading the reviews right now because you haven't made up your mind yet whether to get the book or not. Ask yourself this question: With $15, would you rather watch a movie and eat popcorn and have a good time for a night? Or, for twelve freaking dollars, you get to find out things ABOUT YOURSELF and maybe, in the process, LEARN ABOUT THINGS that will DRAMATICALLY CHANGE your life? Nah, books suck and movies are good. Have fun at the movies. I heard Kill Bill 2 is good....

B00008EY5W|5.0|On the surface this is a splatter flick that uses a lot of high tech toys, incredibly special effects, cheesy acting, and a lot of gratuitous gore to entertain, and it works on that level.  But if you are familiar with the book and really watch the movie, you see the other elements that are almost creepy since they fairly well hidden.<br />This movie was done in the dark comedy style of Paul Verhoeven's earlier works like Robocop or Total Recall.  A dark future where things don't always make sense and violence is commonplace.  This movie was done in a bit of a brighter fashion than the other two movies.  Leaving behind the industrial setting for bright sunny ones, most of the early film is set in Brazil.  <br />The acting is cheesy, but gives it a b movie feel, any movie with Casper Van Dien, Jake Busey, and Denise Richards will feel that way by default.<br />The contrasting military schools were hilarious.  The insanely brutal boot camp with Clancy Brown as the brutal Career Sgt Zim, it also shows how underrated he is as an actor.  This is a camp where they literally break the soldiers down and rebuild them into tough killing machines.  Then you see flight school where it is portrayed as a wonderful and magical experience.  Everyone is having fun and superior officers treat their students in a kind and respectful nature.<br />The fight sequences were amazing.  The special effects looked special, the bugs looked almost real.  The gore was over the top, and you get the feeling of the struggle and terror that they are going through.<br />That is just what is on the surface and what is obvious.<br />One of the things that isn't as obvious is how dark this future world really is, and how often Nazi like references are made.  <br />The teacher at the beginning of the movie refers to how the \\"social leaders of yesterday nearly engineered the downfall of humanity with the failure of democracy, before our leaders imposed the order we have today\\", paraphrased.  Basically saying they were in a military dictatorship.  The flag for the federation was the Nazi flag short only a swastika.  <br />The usage of propaganda was a classic Nazi technique, one that is practiced today.  Remember Iraq's minister of information (?), who gave gleaming reports of how well the Iraq army was doing while the area was being carpet-bombed and most of their soldiers were dropping their guns and surrendering.  <br />The view of what the court system was like in the future.  They had a blip about how a convicted murder was caught, sentenced, and scheduled for execution in one day, available to watch.<br />The speech that the first sky marshal gives prior to the failed attack on Klendathu, \\"Human life, not insect must reign supreme in this galaxy,\\"<BR>The kids were allowed to handle and aim military assault rifles.  Then started fighting over them while the marines laughed, and were given bullets as parting gifts.  As well as the scenes of the schools \\"helping\\" the war effort by stomping on cockroaches.<br />All in all this is a good adaptation of the book, very off key, but keeping a lot of the primary ideas of the book in.  It doesn't really matter that they didn't have the battle suits, since the book wasn't about technical aspects of the future.  It was a glimpse of a future society run by a military dictatorship, only a citizen can vote and only service guarantees citizenship.  Heinlein was known for making his books with his own style of offbeat humor, which is seen throughout the movie, injected with Verhoeven dark humor and off the wall action.  I read and liked the book, and thought that the movie was a good adaptation, making the book word for word probably would have made a movie that flopped, as it was very wordy.<br />Plus the best part of this movie is, that all the major flaws were intentional.  The main being the acting, which just about any director will know you don't pick Casper Van Dien or Denise Richards for their acting talents.  Add Neil Patrick Harris, and you know it has to be at least partially intentional.<br />This definitely isn't a movie for everybody.  If you are an action fan, science fiction fan, or a fan of dark comedy, then this movie is for you.  If you don't like gore, war movies, or violence, then avoid this at all cost, as that is practically the heart of the film.  It partially shows unflinchingly how violent and disturbing war can be, but also for plain and simple gratuitous violence..  It has more splatter style violence than any movie released that year.<br />Also don't take the movie seriously, that would be a big mistake, as it is a dark comedy as well as an action film.  But if you like this sort of movie, you will love it.<br />Five stars for the wonderful mixing of ideas and fun b movie nature of the film.
B000000OQF|5.0|Do you remember albums you played the crap out of? You know, the ones that you played every day, just about, for over a year or two? This was one of those for me.  In my humble opinion, G n' R rank right up there with The Stones, Zep, and Aerosmith as the best rock bands of all time.  Yes, G n' R could suck live and Axl could be a major jerk and he damaged his ties with the band and many fans, but all of that aside, &quot;Appetite&quot; is an awesome rock album, even without the radio hits of &quot;Jungle&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child,&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot; city.  This album is just as powerful 17 years after its release as it was the first day I heard it.

0393316041|5.0|&quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot; is a very interesting book. The many amusing and captivating stories in this autobiography keep you wanting to read more. I personally had a hard time putting this book down every night. Even though I started reading this for a physics project it turned out to be a very entertaining assignment due to the many diverse topics discussed in the book. The subjects discussed range from physics to biology and even touching on hypnosis in one chapter. The book starts out by telling how he acted growing up and then went on to tell about his college life and eventually went all the way to his adult life. This book is a humorous look at the world of science through the eyes of one of the greatest physicists of all time, Richard P. Feynman. It is a must read for anyone interested in any science related field.
B000000H66|5.0|Chuck Schuldiner was a metal pioneer and as thought-provoking an artist through his music as Van Gogh was through his paintings. In the wake of his untimely death in 2001, the modern metal world has been thoroughly cheated of his talents as less talented bands get the recognition that Death so rightfully deserved from the start. However, anyone who has ever been a fan of Death knew that Chuck Schuldiner was never about fame or riding a wave of temporary popularity like most of today's metal outfits, they were about constantly challenging the limits of what can be done musically. Whereas other and more seemingly technical metal bands sought to outdo the others by cramming as many riffs and fills into the smallest time window, many of them failed at the one thing that Death perfected marvelously. Death perfected wrapping that technical ability around a memorable song.<br />Death really began to break away from the herd of run-of-the-mill death metal bands when they released &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot; and they continued to expand their horizons with each subsequent release but to this day, &quot;Symbolic&quot; stands alone as their absolute master work. &quot;Symbolic&quot; still stands as the benchmark for technical death metal albums with it's mesh of thoughtful and insightful lyrics, throaty vocals that are well-pronounced and articulate, soaring bass lines, crushing melodic fretwork and precision drumming. Just when you think it's starting to straighten itself out a little much, something appears out of the corner of your eye like an apparition and by the time you fully realize what you just heard, the ground shifts and the song takes you to the next level.<br />If one had to actually sit down and figure out what would be the most standout tracks on &quot;Symbolic&quot;, the list could change on a dime. Each song has the ability to evoke a different feel and emotion at random times and they have enough weight to carry varied aromas all times. &quot;Symbolic&quot; is less a metal album than a superb work that will go unmatched for years to come.; is less a metal album than a superb work that will go unmatched for years to come.

B0001HAHXW|5.0|I know that this is not exactly Muddy Waters, B.B. King, or Howlin' Wolf, but it is Eric Clapton. Eric is a Brit and not even from the Delta. I would have liked to have heard the voice from the gut like he and the Dominos did on Layla. <br />As far as the music is concerned, what do you mean this isn't bluesy? The only reason anyone is saying that is because he's playing the peices a bit faster than they were back when Robert Johnson wrote them. This is a very exciting cd, and all the musicicns that Eric picked are very, very good. <br />NOTE TO POSSIBlE BUYER- This is an excellent cd but not a good introduction to Clapton. Don't do what I did. I started with Unplugged, which is very different from Eric's other bands/music [so is Me and Mr. Johnson. I would reccommend getting Cream albums or Layla. Happy listening!
B00005JMSE|3.0|Having read several of the comics on which this film is based, I had high hopes for the film.  Sadly, it didn't measure up to my expectations.  It was too derivative and depended too much on special effects-laden fight sequences.<br />Ron Perlman plays Hellboy as if he were Benjamin Grimm/The Thing from \\"The Fantastic Four\\": a mixture of bravado and pathos.  It's not surprising that the actor was able to exude some humanity under all that red makeup; he has made a career out of playing costumed characters (\\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\", \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\").<br />In addition to Hellboy the only other notable character was \\"Abe Sapien\\", physically performed by Doug Jones and voiced\\" by \\"Frasier's\\" David Hyde Pierce.  The character's screen time is limited but memorable.<br />Hopefully, in the sequel (and I'm sure that there will be one) there will be greater development of the Hellboy character, the most interesting comic hero in some time.

0385504209|1.0|I found this book to be a ho-hum read.  It never captured my interest.  It is so full of tired old literary tricks that I found annoying.  One technique I found particularly annoying is the extreme overuse of non-English phrases and definitions within the first few pages. I suppose the author (and many readers) found that to be sophisticated and &quot;learned.&quot;  Also, the whole premise is so obviously controversial while claiming to be &quot;just a good thriller&quot; that it's obvious the author has some personal issues with Christianity.  But I suppose it'll be just a matter of months before a major TV network makes it a &quot;movie of the week.&quot;  Not very original at all but B-O-R-I-N-G.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins is a tough artist to put together a greatest hits collection for ... what do you put on it? This collection is very good. If you're a fan of all the big hits, they're all here. I can't really think of one major solo hit that's missing (maybe We Said Hello Goodbye?). <br />Of course, there will be several songs that big fans will say are missing that were just album tracks that were popular with radio play (Inside Out, Find a Way to My Heart &amp; I Don't Care Anymore come to mind quickly); to include everything would probably require 2 discs. <br />While almost every song here is excellent, the ones that I don't like I so strongly dislike that unfortunately it brings down the rating for me. Seperate Lives &amp; Both Sides? Yuck!!!<br />This will not detract the casual or hardcore fan though from loving this collection. It sure did not detract me! Enjoy.

B00006RAKP|4.0|Let's be realistic here, even in this case. While this is so far the best attempt made, I do not believe that Sir Elton is one of those artists that you will ever be able to put together a complete greatest package of. All songs here are outstanding of course, but there are so many omissions because he produced that much wonderful material. <br />All songs here sound wonderful (great mastering job). But I still believe that you (like myself) will still want (or need) several other Elton albums &amp; collections. Because of this, I now find the Greatest Hits Volumes 1 &amp; 2 to be primarily unnecessary to have. However, you may still want to own the 1976 - 1986 collection. I for one can't live without Mama Can't Buy You Love. You may also want to still have Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (check out the new spiffy Deluxe Edition). <br />If you're also into his late 80's to mid 90's work I still suggest owning Reg Strikes Back (the first half is outstanding), Sleeping With the Past, The One &amp; Made in England.<br />This is now a great place to begin your Elton collection, but do not end it here. It will whet you appetite to get more.
0786867973|5.0|Like so many food lovers, I love Nigella's shows and books, and this is my favorite of hers after Forever Summer.  However, this book has gotten quite a bit of flack for inacuracies in measurements and sometimes people complain about certain recipes lacking sweetness.  <BR>Believe me, you can chalk the latter complaint up to cultural differences!  I have lived in Europe for several years and Americans tend to use A LOT more sugar in their desserts than Europeans.  If this is the case with you, go ahead and put in some extra sugar.  I, myself, have been quite satisfied with all of the recipes I've tried.  <BR>I love the Lemon Syrup Loaf Cake (so simple), the Dense Chocolate Loaf Cake, Fairy Cakes and Lily's Scones.  And let's not forget the savory recipes here.  The Pizza Rustica is fantastic, as is the Spinach and Sausage Pie.<BR>I love the book but it is truly baffling that it costs the same amount as her next book, Nigella Bites.  This one has a greater number of recipes and the recipes are way more interesting than NB.  If you like to bake, buy this one and your friends will never leave you alone!
B0001DI0FI|3.0|3 Stars and a dissapointment in my eyes. <br />I really don't see what got the critics so excited about this movie. The plot is rather thin and there just isn't anything that really stands out. The acting is only slightly above average and simply isn't Crowe's best performance. The only intriguing thing was the scientist's fascination with nature, and how it clashed with the captain's desire to move forward. However, I don't think they touched on this as much as they could have. So much more could have expanded on this issue, and it would have made this movie a lot more interestin .<br />Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was pretty decent, I'm glad there wasn't a battle every 10 minutes and it managed to display a fair portrayal of sea life. I don't see much strategy going on here though. Here is an opportunity to truly dazzle the screen with some creative things the crews decide to do, instead, it boils down to firing at each other relentlessly and seeing who has the best aim with the cannons. It made the movie rather shallow and Crowe's character seem somewhat generic. A lot more could have been done with this movie.
0786868694|2.0|I really, really love Nigella's books, her shows and her approach to food... So believe me when I say it pains me to say that this book is an enormous disappointment.  It is safe to say that this was just meant to be a quick cash-in for Nigella and her publisher.<BR>For $35 you should expect far more than what was offered up in this feeble effort.  I rushed out to buy the book, didn't think twice about it, then got home and couldn't help feeling a little bit taken advantage of once I had time to take it in.<br />Does she really believe that recipes for Bloody Mary's, pancakes, mashed potatoes, pigs in a blanket, sugar cookies and a peanut butter and banana sandwich are worth $35?  I know what you're thinking.  &quot;Maybe these are magic mashed potatoes!&quot;  No.  The &quot;recipe&quot; (if you can call it that) consists of potatoes, milk, butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  It doesn't even offer a fresh approach to mashed potatoes (for a book that does, see Marcus Samuelsson's Aquavit!)<BR>I had about damn near had it when I saw her passing off asparagus with soft boiled egg as a recipe.  That one basically goes like this: boil the egg, boil the asparagus, dip the asparagus in the egg.  Give me a break.<BR>Shoddy recipes on top of two blank pages at the end of each section for your &quot;notes&quot; and two pages per section for very large, bold print that doesn't even take up a half a page, had me losing my faith in the Domestic Goddess.<BR>That said, there are a few recipes here that I liked.  Granny Lawson's lunch dish, the lemon risotto and chocolate cloud cake were good.  So I figure each one of those recipes was worth about $11.66.  <BR>This book is not worth the cost.  My money would have been put to better use getting  bikini wax.  Save yourself the annoyance and opt for one of her other books (all of which are worth the price.)
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The acting is very good, the movie well carfted, but the story, simply put, is not interesting.
B00005JMSE|3.0|This is a slick film with great production values.  Unfortunately, the FX are the show and the monsters basically consist of Squidward and a sword-weilding, robot man, and Rasputin.  Kind of a yawner.  There wasn't much plot or story.<br />I had never heard of Hellboy before this movie.  Looked good, but it being released before the May big movie kick-off should be an indication that it is not a heavy hitter.<br />In the grand scheme of things, this is a low rent X-Men movie.
B000003BDJ|5.0|All the best of the early Stones are on this album, which makes it a great intro to the band and a pure pleasure to listen to!
B00003CXB4|5.0|The movie is awsome. It has perfect graphics and just the perfect songs for my children. My children ever sing the new song morning report on the way to school. Trust me! My wife and me both enjoy it and we watch it every month. Trust me! it is not a waste of your money!
B0000640SA|4.0|What's good about this movie is the innovative way it's told rather than the story.  If told in sequential fashion, I don't think this movie would have made much of an impression on the viewer or had the impact it obviously did.<br />Well done!
B000001EGA|5.0|When 1974's CARIBOU showed Elton John & Bernie Taupin under pressure to get another album out, doubts had to have been raised about whether the duo was losing their knack for spinning straw into gold. But by 1975, they had had about 5 years of massive superstar success behind them, enough for them to look back at their short-but-brilliant career with a concept album harkening back to their beginnings. Sometimes nostalgia isn't really a good thing, but it turned out to be an ace in the hole with 1975's CAPTAIN FANTASTIC & THE BROWN DIRT COWBOY.<br />The title appropriately signifies the two individual personas of Elton & Bernie, with Elton being the true showman (Captain Fantastic) & Bernie the more retiring, simplified person (Brown Dirt Cowboy). While 1973's GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD required a lot of the duo's energy & creativity, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC had to have been more of a labor of love with Elton & Bernie creating art first & commerce second. No one had to be more surprised than them when the album became the very first one ever to debut at #1 on the Billboard album charts.<br />The countryish opening title track introduces our two characters early in their careers when they were just beginning their partnership, writing music more for financial security than making history.<br />The bouncy \\"Tower Of Babel\\" could be the duo first witnessing the cutthroat atmosphere of the music industry with its prominent mood of patting itself on the back & considering themselves higher up than the talent it seeks to promote.<br />\\"Bitter Fingers\\" is a combination of both the previous songs with Elton & Bernie starting to make music for themselves, but finding out the bigwigs want the money to keep rolling in first. This is certainly one of Elton's greatest rockers, and one of his most overlooked.<br />The Philly soul of \\"Tell Me When The Whistle Blows\\" is maybe the first sign of Elton starting to cave under the pressure of being both an artist & a star, and while it may be Bernie's lyrics he is singing, Elton could easily be singing more about himself.<br />That insecurity manifests itself on the album's finest acheivement \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\". Written about an early suicide attempt by Elton, it's easily the album's most accessible track, and was the only single released, becoming a top 5 hit in its full 7-minute glory. While the closing synthesized string arrangement was more of a last-ditch inclusion instead of true strings, it doesn't make the song any less moving. Get out your tissues for this one!<br />And that's just the first half of the album! \\"[Gotta Get A] Meal Ticket\\" is another, more vicious rocker about the ruthlessness of the music industry. This could have made it as a single, but its less-than-flattering attitude towards the business had to have put the kibosh on that notion.<br />\\"Better Off Dead\\" revisits Elton's mental demons which were becoming even more fierce at the time of this recording. \\"Writing\\" appears to have Elton & Bernie foreseeing the two of them collaborating decades into the future. 30 years later, they're still at it, so let's hope that premonition comes through.<br />\\"We All Fall In Love Sometimes\\" & \\"Curtains\\" were separated on the LP and CD, but recorded both in one fell swoop. Taken together, it's a fabulous epic statement with the second part even more stunning with an extended orchestral & choral coda inspired by The Eagles' legendary closing to their DESPERADO album.<br />1975 would prove to be Elton's year for the taking, with his single-only releases proving to be more successful than the music on CAPTAIN FANTASTIC. Early in the year, Elton hit #1 with his cover of the Beatles' \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\". He & John Lennon had struck up a friendship around this time, and when he visited Elton in the studio, Bernie Taupin had commented that \\"Lucy\\", which the Beatles never put out as a single, should have been released. Elton took him up on the offer with John contributing guitar.It may be criminal to say that Elton outdoes the Beatles on his version, but he certainly does a fine job at it.<br />Elton also covered John's \\"One Day [At A Time]\\" from his MIND GAMES album, and while it's a not-bad rendition, it's definitely not something Elton & Bernie could come up with on their own, too traditional. A few months after \\"Lucy\\" hit #1, Elton returned to the top spot with \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\", a song written about his friend Billie Jean King's tennis team. Once again, Elton & Bernie never fail to make it more than just a simple tribute, giving it its own singular identity. Its near-flawless replication of the Philly soul sound even sent the song to the R&B charts, and won Elton the opportunity to perform it on SOUL TRAIN, becoming one of the first White performers to guest on that show.<br />Even while Elton John & Bernie Taupin were starting to fall prey to the intense pressures of stardom & adulation (Bernie had his own problems with addictions just like Elton), their magic touch was still keen enough early on to create a natural wonder like CAPTAIN FANTASTIC & THE BROWN DIRT COWBOY. The worst of their troubles had yet to begin (the follow-up to this album was the first sign that Elton & Bernie maybe needed time away from each other), but for now, the duo had little to complain about with all the success in their midst.It may be criminal to say that Elton outdoes the Beatles on his version, but he certainly does a fine job at it.<br />Elton also covered John's \\"One Day [At A Time]\\" from his MIND GAMES album, and while it's a not-bad rendition, it's definitely not something Elton & Bernie could come up with on their own, too traditional.

B00003CXXM|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Ludlum novel and was anxious to see the movie version.  Other than the title of the movie and the name of the main character, there is very little resemblance between the outstanding novel and this very standard Hollywood action movie.  And I really do not understand why the screenwriter decided to divert so dramatically from the novel.  It sure was not to add more suspense -- Ludlum's novel was full of that.  The movie even left out the villian of the book -- Carlos the Jackal.  Hard to imagine leaving the bad guy out of a supposed spy thriller.  My advice, read the book.  You will enjoy that much more than this movie.
0385510438|4.0|This book is well worth reading.  After initially reading the leaf, one would expect a can't-put-it-down thriller such as &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; or the &quot;Pelican Brief&quot;.  I think it reads closer to &quot;Painted House&quot; because it does more to tell a tale of small town day to day life in rural Mississippi then a story revenged filled killer.  A nice twist at the end helps spice up the story line.
0743490304|3.0|upside: classic dan brown style of writing<br />downside: classic dan brown style of writing<br />my third dan brown book (DVC and A&amp;D).  those familiar with dan brown's style will recoginize that once again he uses the same &quot;formula&quot; to produce a high-pace, intellectual thriller.  but that formula feels a bit old now leaving the ending entirely predictable.  heres the outline:<br />step 1: introduce a mysterious death<br />step 2: begin to outline the plot<br />step 3: introduce the mysterious unknown bad guy behind everthing<br />step 3: introduce the hero with specific specialty<br />step 4: introduce the hero's love interest with specific specialty<br />step 5: continue on the plot and tie in mysterious death<br />step 6: introduce the major twist<br />step 7: hero and love interest make out<br />still a worthwhile read though.  so if you have the time to enjoy it, pick it up.  if there are others books on your list, read those first.
B000000W5L|3.0|'Exile on Main Street' has some really good songs, but other ones that are not so good.  The album's highlights are 'Rocks Off', 'Thumbling Dice', 'Happy', and 'Loving Cup'.  A decent mixuture of blues, country, and rock.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Most times, for little films (ones that don't need large wide-screen panoramas or lots of special affects, you don't lose much in going to the small screen.  Lost in Translation may be an exception to that general rule. Roger Ebert had an interesting observation in his recent letter column. Several readers noted that there seemed to be a big discrepency: those who first saw this film in a theatre were much more likely to rate it highly than those who first saw it on DVD.  One reader noted:  &quot;I loved 'Lost in Translation' in the theater and encouraged all of my friends to see it. Every single one who saw it on video was bored by the movie. To me, much of the humor and interest was in Bill Murray's expressions and reactions. Is there a possibility that this would be lost on the small screen?&quot;  Another said: &quot;it's been my experience that quiet, character-driven movies also benefit from this environment, even though this may sound somewhat counterintuitive. In a dark and quiet theater, free of the distractions of home viewing, you can concentrate and appreciate this type of film much more.&quot;  I think they may be on to something here.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|DVD will play movie if options has not been chosen after one minute.    This is the third and last Matrix film.    Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Harold Perrineau, Hugo Weaving, Collin Chou, Clayton Watson, Anthony Wong, Anthony Zerbe and 19 other cast members return from the second film, THE MATRIX RELOADED (2003).    Gloria Foster (\\"The Oracle\\") passed away from diabetes on September 29, 2001.  Alice Brady, whom she had worked on Broadway with for 2 years in \\"Having No Say\\", stepped in to play the Oracle.    The movie begins where the second film, THE MATRIX RELOADED ended.    Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Bane (Ian Bliss) are in a coma, but in the Matrix. Seraph (Collin Chou) calls that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) must see The Oracle (Alice Brady) at once!  Neo is lost in the Matrix. Actually he is at the subway station at Mobil Avenue that leads into the Matrix.  The Trainman (Bruce Spence) works for Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and he is going to make it very difficult for our team.  At the station, Neo meets a friendly family that is a program, Rama Kandra (Bernard White), Kamala (Tharini Mudaliar) and Sati (Tanveer K. Atwal).  When Neo finds his way, he must speak to Oracle.  She warns him the war must end tonight by him or Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) will have the world.    Running Time: 2 hrs, 09 min.    The Executive Producers, directors and writers of all 3 Matrix films, the brother Andy and Larry Wachowski have definately said the Matrix films are over.  But fans would love for them to make Matrix 4.    \\"THE MATRIX ONLINE\\" video game (2004) is a continuing story after the last film, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS (2003).

B000000W5B|5.0|Her tired schtick is showing. Fewer album sales and can't even reach #1 anymore (unlike the Stones). Mick is famous for his lips, Janet tries to flash her lips in desperation. Pity the poor has-been.
B00005Y228|5.0|Unlike some Indian reviewers who like to review albums multiple times then give &quot;better&quot; reccomendations, I will only review this album once, like we are supposed to. :-D  This album is amazing!  Although I am more of a &quot;Body Language&quot; guy myself, this album is a dancefloor masterpiece! If you want to get down and boogie, then this is the album for you!  Go Kylie!
B000025XKM|5.0|the music of nick drake is like a dark look inside someones soul. and this album is the darkest part of it. after making 2 brilliant albums, that got little or no commercial acclaim, nick drake became very depressed, and made this in 2 nights at his home, brought the tapes to the record company unnanounced, then checked himself into a psychiatric ward. this is the music of someone about to lose their life. the title track was used in a volkswagen commercial a few years ago, but it is a classic song, and is great. the songs on this album can't exactly be explained track by track, but the standouts are pink moon, place to be, which will(which i think might be the best song nick ever penned) things behind the sun, free ride, and from the morning. if you are interested in getting into the music of nick drake, i feel that this is the best place to start with. believe me you will go out and buy five leaves left, and bryter layter the same day like i did. nick was a tortured soul, who was taken way too soon.

B000001ZS5|4.0|Looks like most listeners believe that electronica musicians should always look dark and serious, looking like they are immersed in deep meditation about the mysteries of the universe (Vangelis?). So this French guy closes the album with a funny sort-of-latino joke, and suddenly the album is rubbish. Well, it's not to me. I've seen Jarre live and he looks like a guy who's having fun, so it doesn't surprise me when he plays this type of thing. In fact, Les Chants... is a very good album, in the same league as Oxygene (where by the way there are &quot;silly latin percussion&quot; moments too, although a little less obvious)
B000002H2H|5.0|Wow, what can i say about ride the lightning? Well if you're a (...) little teenie bopper who thinks 50 cent and britney spears is real music, then let me give you some background info on this mighty album.<BR>I'm pretty sure it was releases in '84, back when you had to be bloody good to be a band, nowdays anybody can be a band, watch something like video hits for examples. This was metallicas 2nd album, their 1st being kill 'em all which i havn't got around to buying yet but i got high hopes.<br />Now there's some arguments amoung metalheads about metallica going mainstream upon their realase of the black album, but in my opinion yes their older stuff was far better and peaked around ...And Justice for All and maybe even the black album (although justice for all is still my all time favourite) , but the albums load and reload are still metallica in all their glory (st anger is different for reason im not going to go into in this reveiw).<BR>I've got 7 of metallica's albums, all which are great, and i rate this album probably number 3 (#1 being justice and #2 master of puppets).<BR>Here's what i think of each track:<br />Fight Fire With Fire: starts off with a soft acoustic intro but dont be fooled, it soon goes into a loud hardcore thrash song about nuclear warfare and destroying the planet etc. Great song.  10/10<br />Ride the Lightning: The title track has some great guitar parts but its not one of my personal favourites on the album, never the less a great song.   9/10<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: Along with Harvester of Sorrow and Master of puppets this is 1 of my all time favourite Metallica songs! and its so hard to choose favourites since they have made so many good songs. The way this song starts with the bell and goes into the heavy riff...well i could go on for ages about it. 11/10<br />Fade to Black:  a song about suicide that was very contriversial. EAsily another one of my favourite metallica songs. 10/10<br />Trapped under Ice:  as the name suggests,about a guy being frozen in ice and cant move. I think its an interesting topic to write a song about, and its another good fast song with great guitar work.    9/10<br />Escape:  As far as I can tell from the lyrics and the sirens in the background its about a guy breaking out of prison i think. It has a great chorus and not as fast as the previous track, its still great.  9/10<br />Creeping Death:  Ive always thought this one of metallica's more creative songs. Its about the whole story of Moses and the plauges of Egypt. I personally love it, especially the heavy bit in the middle where it slows down a little and goes \\"Die! By my hand, I creep across the land, killing 1st born man....\\"<BR>The chorus is also good.   10/10<br />The Call of Ktulu:  I have to admit im not a big fan of instrumentals,  i find they get a bit repeditive, but not this one! This is by far my favourite instrumental ive ever heard! The only other great one i can think of is To live is To Die (also by metallica off ...And Justice for All)<BR>the guitar work again is incredible.  9.5/10<br />So there you have it. Ride the lightning. I like everything about this album from the heavy riffs and raw agression in the lyrics to the picture on the front of the elecrtic chair in a lightning storm.<BR>What are you waiting for? Go out and buy it!
B000002KBA|1.0|The first time I listened to this thang (when I was a tender teen rocker) I though it was a joke.<br />But then, many of my hard rock loving friends were so gung ho about it, I thought &quot;I must be wrong&quot;.<br />Now that I'm an old fart (and proud of it!), I listened to the thang again and boy, was I right!<br />Ian Gillan's performance in Speed King really deserves a place in Rock History. Specifically under the chapter &quot;Laughable Yelling Clowns&quot;.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Im a huge linkin park fan but Hybrid Theory is wayyy better. Meteora is a good album but not the greatest of them. My favorite song has to be Breaking the Habbit. Its got a good beat to it and I like it a lot. Also Numb is good. Meteora is a good album but Hybrid Theory is defanitly LP's best.
B000002KGT|4.0|Should Mac's fans limit themselves to declare this is a good collection of finely crafted pop songs, I'd be more than happy to agree with them.<br />But when people rate this as a larger than life American classic... whoa, hold on a second.<br />It sold a couple gazillion copies because it was tailor-made for radio airplay. But after listening to it a few times (you don't even need to buy the record, just tune to your town oldies station and one of its songs would pop up anytime) it becomes a tad repetitive, tiresome. There are not that many ideas in the album.<br />Very well played and sung though, but undeserving of the oversized hype.
B000002NG7|5.0|Yes, this album is a little bit sadder. In fact, it is true that it sounds like if they didn't want to release this record but I'll tell you, it's an AMAZING one! You may disagree with me but few bands have a brilliant career like FNM. Name one band which hasn't at least one bad album. Faith No More is the exception to the rule. All of their work is outstanding and above average. But of course you already knew that. There are some people who are saying that Album of The Year is worse than Angel Dust. In my oppinion, I don't think it's true. Both offer different conceptions of music and they complement each other with some diversity. While Angel Dust is more straight-forward with some new-metal (sorry for the insight) roots and depressive lyrics, Album of The Year offers so much more complexity and defines better the FNM style like no other CD before this one.<br />My favorite songs are \\"Collision\\" (Powerful!), Naked In Front of The Computer\\" (Agressive and crazy at times!), \\"Helpless\\" (an acoustic quiet song that turns into beautiful grunge-like song), \\"Mouth To Mouth\\" (start weird and gets heavy!), \\"She loves Me Not\\" (this song is funny and extremely well played!). In my oppinion, the least good of the songs is Pristina, which is a big filler with a chorus. Nevermind. If you're a FNM fan or a new listener you may wanna buy this CD with no fear.
B000001ZS3|4.0|This guy did Oxygene with a bunch of monophonic synths and a Farfisa (no, really!) organ. What a beautiful example for today's lame brains of electronica who can't even record a 10-seconds loop if they don't have the latest Clavia Nord. Anyway, the music in Oxygene is good, sometimes great, sometimes a tad boring, but overall a very enjoyable album and an amazing work considering the time it was conceived.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|And so the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy concludes, taking in a boatload of cash overseas while kind of limping to the box office finish line in the states.  I must say that I'm a fan of all three movies despite their flaws (for one, the machines and programs within the Matrix seem to have more personality than the humans we're supposed to be rooting for) and &quot;Revolutions&quot; is an improvement over the start and stop of pacing of &quot;Reloaded.&quot;  It would be very interesting to see the latter two films in the same form in which they were shot, which is to say, together.  For a brief rundown, the effects and action sequences were spectacular, the acting was actually not awful and the the death of one major character actually elicited surprise from me.  (SPOILER WARNING!):  Neo's demise, however, did not, and that is my primary problem with the film.  Just rename Neo Jesus and get it over with.  I could see it coming a mile away and, while it's not a bad way to go in a narrative sense, I felt let down by the lack of suspense.  Overall, though, &quot;Revolutions&quot; is a thouroughly satisfying ride of technical excellence that is just plain fun to watch.
B000002KHB|3.0|What would have happened to this album if these guys have had all the recording toys they were supposed to have? (if you don't know the story, the casino where they were going to record caught fire, hence the lyrics in Smoke on the Water, so they moved to a truck equipped with bare basic gear where they record this).<br />It would have probably been a lousy thing like &quot;Deep Purple with the London Philharmonic&quot;.<br />What saves the album is that &quot;no frills&quot; feeling, almost live-playing quality. DP was a band made for immediate sonic impact -the more you listen to them, the less appealing they become. So I guess they should be thankful for the darn fire. The songs are poorly crafted -but at least Gillan and Blackmore were in good form.
0743216458|5.0|\\"Band of brothers\\" is the story of Easy Company, a division of the 101st Airborne Regiment of Paratroopers. During the decisive moments of the Second World War, from D-Day in Normandy to the takeover of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Austria, Easy Comnpany was present in many important battles, conquests, and even some failures (like Market Garden).<br />Stephen Ambrose wrote this book after several interviews with the remaining members of Easy Company. Although \\"Band of brothers\\" is fundamented and researched in actual history, this book feels more like a collection of chronicles and memoirs of the Company paratroopers. That's why it reads more like a society history than a lesson in history. (...) Band of brothers\\" is based on human memories and recollections, and it was intended to be so from the start, not a detailed account of battles, war tactics, etc.<br />Ambrose's writing is light and makes the reader comfortable with what he's reading. I think some readers mistake this book for a war story; however, it is a story about PEOPLE that happen to be fighting in a war, and should be read like this. That's the way to read it, and appreciate it in a rightly way.<br />Grade 8.8/10
B00005T5YK|4.0|When the Eagles released this record they were mature, yet not aging rock dinosaurs, and it shows. No filler here -all solid music.<br />As for the newest generation DVD thingies, I have no frigging' idea what they are. I listen to HC in my old faithful CD player (vintage 94 or so). More than enough. And I would enjoy it in vinyl version too. Good music don't need no fancy schmancy tech tricks to be enjoyed.
B000002N2N|5.0|I had this baby on vinyl for years. I went on to listen to metal, wave, grunge and and now mostly trance (that's \\"edgy\\" music for geezers LOL)<br />I finally saw them one night at a tiny club in San Diego in the early eighties.(...) They were amazing. And everybody in the audience sang along with all the lyrics (as fast as possible of course).<br />But this baby still 'effing rocks sooooo good. They were at the peak of music re-creation on this CD - they just didn't know it.<br />God Bless you Joey and Dee Dee wherever you are.<br />Zig
B000001ZS8|5.0|Human voice had never been used so creatively in electronica before -and I doubt anything in the same league was done after it. Zoolook got some undeserved bad press as merely another dance album (perhaps for the silly video) but it is one of the best synth albus ever, and probably the best of Jarre.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|This is a supernatural mystery that comes across like a mixture of &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot;  Halle Berry finally proves she can carry a film as a lead actor with her frantic performance of a woman who no one, not even the audience, is sure if she is insane or not.  I was hoping throughout that she was sane and that her innocence would be made clear, thus I was trying to finger the real killer during the whole movie.  The plot kept me guessing about a lot of things: her state of mind, who she could trust(if anyone), who could the killer be?  I was actually interested all the way through.  My advice is not to try and figure things out, for the plot will unfold.  Trust me.  The ending even presents the possibility for sequels.  Overall, this was enjoyable, if not completely realistic or logical.  But as Halle Berry states in the film, &quot;Logic is overrated.&quot;  So get yourself a bag of popcorn and enjoy.
B0000028MA|5.0|In the course of the two decades I have listened to music, my favorite decade for music was the early '90s when alternative (I hate using this world immensely) music was big thanks to the explosion of Nirvana and grunge (another term I hate using) music. One of the most defining moments in alternative music that particular decade was the Seattle-based film &quot;Singles&quot; (one of the few films I can stomach from Cameron Crowe). Not only did I love the film but the soundtrack was equally good. It had some of the hottest modern rock bands of the decade on one cd. Not only was it the soundtrack to an excellent film but also the soundtrack to generation x (ugh! another term I loathe). One of my personal favorite songs on the cd is by Minneapolis hero Paul Westerberg &quot;Dyslexic Heart&quot;, an incredibly infectious song that I could not get out of my head when I first heard the song. The cd kicks off with one of the most premier grunge bands from the '90s, &quot;Would&quot; by Alice in Chains. It is one of my favorite songs by Alice in Chains with its trademark sludge guitars provided by Jerry Cantrell and nihilistic lyrics by Layne Stayley (R.I.P). Ironically enough, Cameron's wife Nancy Wilson (Heart/The Lovemongers) appears on the cd with her side project The Lovemongers. They do a fairly interesting cover of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot;. All the songs are great. I love the Screaming Trees' &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; and &quot;Seasons&quot; by Chris Cornell. &quot;Singles&quot; is evidence to what great music that came out of the '90s. Too bad the new millenium has proven jacksquat.
B000002HEP|4.0|4.5 stars.  The music here is driving and heavy with memorable guitar work and washes of baked psychedelia.  It's late afternoon and even the scorpions are seeking shelter from the hot desert sun as &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot; surges through your stereo speakers as you fly down the highway.  This album reminds me of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; by Soundgarden, where it is equally raw and heavy, but with dynamic songcraft.  The lead vocalist is nowhere near the level of Chris Cornell, but after hearing this album as many times as I have, I couldn't imagine them having a different singer.  The only other slight criticism is that once in a while a couple of the songs lose focus, meandering from superb Metal grooves into funk or off into space rock.  Overall, however, this is a must for anyone who was a fan of Soundgarden back in 1992 when they released the magnificent &quot;Badmotorfinger.&quot;  This has a similar style in the Stoner Rock vein.  Later.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Just to clarify for those people who have nothing good to say about this movie.  You obviously didn't pay attention while watching.  The end scene does not take place in the mental institute!!  Dr. Grey goes out of town to her husband's &quot;other&quot; house, remember?  While she is there the police show up and take her to the police station.  She is stuck there all night in lock-up.  The only person missing is probably the officer who should be on duty to watch her until morning.  I assume the Sheriff tells the other guy to leave when he shows up in the middle of the night to talk to Dr. Grey.  In the end there are a lot of plot holes, but I was entertained and that's all that counts.  It doesn't hurt to use your own brain once in a while a figure things out for yourself.  I don't want everything spelled out for me.  This is not oscar worthy, but relax people and just sit back and enjoy.

0385510438|5.0|Story teller John Grisham spins us another yard of life in rural Mississippi thru the eyes of a newspaper owner/editor.  We are again taken to Clanton, Mississippi and meet familiar characters like Harry Rex and Lucien Willbanks.<br />Grisham spins a tale with his usual ingredients; someone has done a dastardly deed (rape and murder in this case) and was sentenced to life in prison.  However, in 1970's Mississippi, a life sentence translates to about 10 years.  Now the jurors are being killed off, one by one.<br />The ending is a surprise and the astute reader will figure out &quot;who dun it&quot; but it is a fast read and a good read.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|A lot of people complained about the follow ups to the 1999 surprise hit the MAtrix.  My question is for what reasons was there to complain?  It had the same style of actions sequences, it had the same bad ass villian in Agent Smith, Neo still did the insane kick ass stuff he always did, so where was the problem?<br />The story here is that Zion is about to be destroyed by the machine Army.  It is up to NEo to go in and take stop them, however when Agent Smith becomes so powerful the both Man and Machine are in danger it is up to NEo to stop him in the ever classic battle of Good vs Evil.<br />I guess people had problems with these movies because in many ways they had to high of expectations.  The case here is much like the case with the new Star Wars Trilogy, it is the same style of film making with a number of characters we are familiar with, but people got their hopes and expectations to high and in the end it came crashing down into oblivion for them.  That curse hit MAtrix by psycho obssessive fans and the same I fear will happen to the follow ups to both Spiderman, X-Men, and and other follow ups to incredible smashs (I am talking to you The Hobbit).<br />OVerall this is a decent movie in the same style of MAtrix, just not a whole lot that is new to this series that's all.

B00005JLEU|5.0|You can read the descriptions of the plot anywhere. But what is missing is the story behind the movie.  I never heard of this director or his works before. It was in a review I read in Osaka that spoke of him. Later I caught his name when a Disney Animator talked about him in obvious awe. In the story I read in Japan Miyazaki-san did something I can only imagine.  He would draw thousands of frames himself. His style is that of ancient Japanese art. This is a man who does so for the love of the works results rather than a box office take. So when I finally saw this movie with English subtitles I was not only caught up with the story, characters and rich beauty but I was in awe of the details and timing and work done by Miyazaki-san.  Details you would never see even in the best that Disney can offer.  Afterthoughts, things going on all over the screen. Things that no computer could do (Miyazaki-san disdains computers).  Its an amazing thing when you realize what he had done. Even Maxim magazine, believe it or not, said they didn't understand it, but it was and I quote &quot;beautiful&quot;. Talk about praise from an unexpected source. The efforts in this movie are only touched on when you see the Japanese special (especially informative on animation construction).<br />This movie came and went in one week showing in one theater in all of Syracuse. My family wasn't interested so they never saw it in the U.S. I saw it in Japan and told my wife about it.  It came through town again and she took the kids to see it.  They sat quiet for the whole movie and talked about it for a week.<br />Everyone who has seen it has been floored by it.<br />Remember when you see this movie that many things are said through silence and done so well that you get the message. Thoughts conveyed with eye movement rather than dialogs. The details you pick up whether you want to or not will amaze you. Also remember that Magic does not always makes sense.<br />The only thing I saw wrong with this DVD was not the movie itself but when the President of Pixar brought Miyazaki-san in front of the camera, pointed to it and presented him to the world. Miyazaki-san's obvious discomfort to this publicity was embarrassing. I cannot fault the Pixar's guy for his enthusiasm but I saw a man who did not do something like this for such publicity.<br />So skip that part and go right to the movie. Sit back by yourself or better with a crowd and enjoy.  I also suggest you buy it if you can afford it. You will watch it again.s not the movie itself but when the President of Pixar brought Miyazaki-san in front of the camera, pointed to it and presented him to the world.

B000063DGC|5.0|I used to have the old LP but I never got the CD version because they've removed the beginning of the Carmina Burana on the CD. When they've release the Re-Mastered version, they added back the complete beginning... It's great... Tracks like Crazy Train, Believer and Mr. Crowley are incredible and listen to PURE Randy is one unique experience!!! I have my Tribute to Randy in my car, and everytime I need some motivation I listen to Crazy Train very loud!!!

B0000CAQ27|4.0|Pink has something that sets her apart from all the annoying, squeaky, breathy little-girl voices cluttering the airways these days:  TALENT.  Besides being a curious but immensely likable blend of sass, spirituality, wisdom and immaturity, this girl has a VOICE, an AMAZING VOICE, and it is brillantly showcased on &quot;Try This&quot; (along with the aforementioned qualities, readily apparent in her up-close-and-personal lyrics, bonus DVD interview and CD credits).  Pink deviates refreshingly from the glitzy plastic (and to this reviewer hopelessly vapid) images perpetuated by the likes of Spears, Aguilera, Beyonce and even (Janet) Jackson.  She dares to sport some &quot;bad girl&quot; tattoos and piercings and a cropped 'do, straying into a punkish style complete with attitude, yet even in doing so fails to hide her beauty or her cleverness.   <br />Range and creativity are in abundance on &quot;Try This&quot;.  Pink leaps adroitly from the panting and sensual &quot;Oh My God&quot; to the rock wailing on &quot;Waiting for Love&quot; to the country pop flair of &quot;Walk Away&quot;.  And while some of the lyrics are less than stellar (&quot;She felt like a piece of s***&quot;), absolutely no flaws are to be found in the voice or the music.  Personal favs on this CD include &quot;Humble Neighborhood&quot; (possibly the best dance tune I've heard in YEARS--I defy anyone to sit still while this plays!!), &quot;Unwind&quot;, &quot;Try Too Hard&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Love&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;Oh My God&quot;. <br />Really the only criticism to be offered of &quot;Try This&quot; is the unnecessarily explicit lyrics, which reflect the artist's youth and immaturity.  Hopefully Pink will realize that profanity can have a place (think Nickelback's &quot;Yankin' Out My...&quot; or even Who's &quot;Who Are You?&quot;), but on &quot;Try This&quot; it too often detracts from the overall presentation.<br />In the bonus interview, Pink pays homage to Janice Joplin.  And it is impossible not to think of the tremendous female voices of past decades (Benetar, Slick, Mc Vie, Jett, Lenox and, yes, even Joplin) when you hear Pink belt out tunes like &quot;Waiting for Love&quot;.  If the correct marketing is done, in conjunction with her own tremendous talent, Pink should be very, VERY BIG indeed.  &quot;Watch how she does this, here&quot;!!
0316666343|4.0|This book touched me so much. I loved the perspecitve and the writing style Sebold used, it was absolutely amazing. However, the end of the book did not thrill me as much as I had anticipated. The whole body switch was too out there for me, as well as the very ending (I won't give it away for those who haven't read it). But, I would recommend this book in a heart beat, just don't be looking forward to an overly happy ending.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|That's because the media keeps shoving this crap down everyone's throats. &quot;Toxic&quot; has got to be the worst song I heard in my life. Whenever my friends listen to it, I just go crazy and want to commit suicide. My friends listen to heavy metal and they actually bother to download Britney Spears off of the internet. I think she looks good but I'm not going to buy her CDs or download her music.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|My husband and I have watched this film many times over the years, but we were pleasantly surprised at the clarity of the picture on the new DVD release. We saw things we had never seen before! The scenery of California's Mendocino Coast is beautiful, and one can almost feel the wind blowing. The story affects us differently as we also age. We tend to identify with  the characters (not surprisingly!)when they are our own ages. Having been born in the late 40s, their first encounters were in our childhood, but we remember many of the cars, hair and dress styles. The historical data between the &quot;acts&quot; challenges us to identify the persons and events related. Is there a list of that anywhere?<br />The film is a definite must-see for all who like a good romantic film, even with the wrong basic premise. It could almost make adultery popular!
B00018D44U|1.0|If you do, you will probably enjoy this album. I am a jazz fan and was very disappointed with Feels Like Home. I managed to listen to the entire album by hoping that there would be one track that I could enjoy. &quot;Sunrise&quot; is not bad but it goes downhill from there. I wish I had read a review like this and saved my money.
B000002NBY|4.0|At first, I was a little taken aback when I opened this disc, in large part because I thought it was an audio record of former Illinois senator Paul Simon's testimony regarding the Tennessee Valley Authority's effects on wholesale energy prices. However, after a listen, I realized that it's interesting in its own right.  I decided not to return it after all, and now enjoy every song on the disc.  I am still a little unclear on whether it's the same guy or not.
B00005KHL5|4.0|You know you're in for a ride when one of the first exchanges of the movie runs along the lines of: &quot;What's new?&quot; &quot;Oh, rape, sodomy, the usual.&quot; There's a bracing dialogue between righteous and right throughout this film, plus lots of camp '70s fashion, bizarre musical numbers and gratuitous nudity of the most ridiculous and entertaining kind. Whoever picked the nude female extras for this film probably has a shrine to J-Lo in his home, if you know what I mean. But all the fun and campiness kind of drains away as you watch for a truly horrific ending with some fine acting from humans and animals alike. I'm not quite sure it all works, but it's a hell of a ride.

0375713751|2.0|This book is better birth control than an afternoon at the Park Slope Food Coop (habitat of the undisciplined bobo brat). The endless hassles and humiliations that make up Kate Reddy's days juggling high-powered career, kids and husband gave me a case of heartburn and elevated blood pressure just from turning the pages. Pearson's zany plot twists verge on sadism, even if the character's decision to sell her soul so completely for cash renders her unsympathetic from the start.  For a certain tiny, VERY privileged slice of society, the horrors of Kate's life may approach reality. But, like hemorrhoids or cockroach mating habits, are such mundane yet unpleasant subjects worth reading about if they're not rendered by a master? This is only middling work, and I can't imagine a harried mother would want to spend her free time reliving the worst moments of her life. Quick, someone, tie my tubes!
B00005NTNM|4.0|THE ENFORCER is the third entry to the Dirty Harry series. While a good perforance by Eastwood overall, the movie does not quite match up to the Don Siegel-directed original or MAGNUM FORCE, (which I consider his best movie). While THE ENFORCER is not the weakest Dirty Harry movie, it does have the weakest plot. Here Dirty Harry has to save the city of San Fancisco from a group of rebellious punks who are obsessed with heavy artiliary. They call themselves the People's Revolutionary Strike Force, and they are led by Bobby Maxwell, a deranged Vietnam Vet who wants to terrorize the public in exchange for ransom. After slaughtering 2 gas company employees, they break into an artility warehouse to steal the goods. Harry's partner, DeGeorgio arrives on the scene and is killed in the process. While trying to try down DeGeorgio's killer, Harry is assigned a new parter in the form of Kate Moore, (Tyne Daly), a yacking half-pint who wants to impress him in every way possible. Harry doesn't quite agree with the plan, especially when she is on the force just to coincide with the mayor's plans to be \\"stylish.\\" But Moore turns out to be more valuable then he ever imagined, helping lead him to Maxwell, and saving his life twice along the way.<br />Of all the Dirty Harry films, this one has the most humor. The comments that Callahan makes at the personel review of Moore are hilarious. We also have him driving a car through a liquor store, (continuing with the traditon of breaking up a robbery). Another funny sequence is when he chases Henry Lee Coldwell halfway across the city and back! He follows him over fences, across rooftops, and through skylights, disturbing a porn shooting in the process! Jerry Fielding took over the musical score here, and as a result, the traditional Dirty Harry theme is nowhere to be found. This is rather disappointing and takes away from the movie's serious potential. Fielding's jazzy them is effective during the chase sequence however. These film doessuffer from long sequences that really aren't neccessary. The one that will really make you laugh is when Callahan enters a brothel posing as \\"Larry Dickman!\\" Dirty Harry regular, Albert Popwell, shows up here as a leader of a black militant group.<br />The Revolutionary Strike Force eventually switches gears by kidnapping the mayor for even more ransom.  Harry is eventually is led to Alcatraz Island, where the mayor is being held captive. The climax on Alcatraz is exciting, but I wish it didn't unfold so fast. The ending is very sad, although I will not give that away. While THE ENFORCER is not up to par with the first two movies in the series, it is still a solid chapter in the book of Dirty Harry. \\"Power to the People.\\"
0385504209|1.0|Welcome to the world of cardboard villains. Brown's idea of giving dimension to a character seems to be either having them switch allegiances without warning, or else giving them some sort of disabling condition, like albinism or walking on crutches. (Improbably, Brown's albino character seems to suffer none of the usual loss of visual acuity that accompanies that condition.)<br />Our Junior Batmen are chasing after the Holy Grail, which in Brown's universe, shaped as it is by popular conspiracy-theory speculations rather than certified scholarship, is not the cup of Christ, but a \\"royal bloodline\\" composed of descendants of Jesus Christ and (who else?) Mary Magdalene. This theory has been promoted without success before, most notably in the 1983 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, and Richard Leigh (New York: Dell).  That book has been soundly critiqued.<br />Within Mary's tomb, our heroes are told, are all manner of secret documents whose contents will wreck Christianity as we know it. These recovered \\"truths\\" will pave the way for us to return to a more enlightened spirituality whose centerpiece is the feminized divine known from goddess worship. The idea that religion was originally matriarchal, or dominated by goddess worship, and later (under the Judeo-Christian dominance) changed to patriarchal monotheism (male dominated) is a myth.  It is not true.  There is no evidence that any significant religious movement had dominant female deities - they were always linked to their male counterparts, and usually in a subservient role.  [See, for example, Tikva Frymer-Kensky's In the Wake of the Goddesses (New York: Ballantine Books, 1993) and Craig Hawkins' Goddess Worship, Witchcraft, and Neo-Paganism (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1998).] The book is mostly spent in chasing after the location of this tomb, but in the end - too bad! - the book closes with the lead character finding the tomb and disclosing nothing, so we will never know whether Mary Magdalene's crypt contained a secret new Gospel or Judas Iscariot's grocery list.<br />One the first things a reader of The DaVinci Code will see, in prefatory material and under a heading in bolded, capital letters, reading \\"FACT\\", is this statement:<br />&quot;All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.&quot;<br />In terms of documents and rituals, however - and even artwork and architecture -- The DaVinci Code contains few \\"facts\\" and what few it does contain require serious qualification. All of this might be excused, except that Brown baptizes such aspects of the book with the brand of FACT, and that he also puts many of these \\"facts\\" into the mouth of a character named Teabing who is described as a reputable historian. I rather think if any genuine, academic historian made certain statements attributed to Teabing, he would be promptly demoted to janitorial duties and remanded for training in History 101. Sadly, Brown's sleight-of-hand under the cloak of fact has tricked others, including the Book Review Editor of the New York Daily News, who commented naively that \\"his research is impeccable.\\"<br />I found a very thorough examination of the bogus items presented as &quot;facts&quot; in this book here:<br />[...]ary Magdalene's crypt contained a secret new Gospel or Judas Iscariot's grocery list. <br />One the first things a reader of The DaVinci Code will see, in prefatory material and under a heading in bolded, capital letters, reading \\"FACT\\", is this statement:<br />&quot;All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.&quot;<br />In terms of documents and rituals, however - and even artwork and architecture -- The DaVinci Code contains few \\"facts\\" and what few it does contain require serious qualification.

B0001IN07Q|1.0|This album is another attempt, by another guy (in this case a Canadian who has been 25 for like three years now according to his biography), that got under the wing of David Foster and that's about it. The songs are like impressions, and to be honest I like the likes of Brian Evans and Peter Cincotti MUCH better than this guy. The album sounds like karaoke tracks, and there is no feeling in the album the way Sinatra performed these songs. &quot;Fever&quot; sounds corny &quot;Feva!&quot; is what it should be called, and the way Buble sings it, even spelling it with four letters as I have is too long.<br />I'm not into wannabe's, but there's one born every minute, but I suggest you buy ALL the albums of these guys, and then decide. This guy has nothing on either Evans or Cincotti, and time will tell.

0140386335|5.0|Many, if not all, children know the story of the Neverending Story by the movie.  It is a favorite of most, and an ispiration to all.  Of course, the second one, it is said, isn't as good as the first.  Perhaps that is because the first is the story-line we know, and the second contradicts some of the character traits we know and love.<br />But for those of us who have read the book, the second movie is just the second half of the book, and, though poorly done, is correct as far as the story-line goes.  The problem is, there are slight differences between the book and the movie that are somewhat engraved in the minds of those who have read or seen it.<br />Those who saw the movie first, picture Bastian as a skinny little boy who reads too much.  But those who read the book first know that Bastian really was made fun of for his weight and inability to play games.  Such differences are petty and insignificant, but it's as if we're taking little bits away from the author and replacing them with our own misshapen ideas.<br />The Neverending Story is a classic work of fantasy that every parent should read to their child as early as possible.  It will not only teach them the importance of their imagination, but introduce them the wonderful world of Fantastica, and give them many good dreams to come.

0385504209|4.0|Oh Goodness, I really wasn't going to do this but I will.<br />As someone who has been reading about the Gnostic Gospels and other aspects of &quot;unorthodox&quot; christianity, I just had to throw my two cents into the fray.<br />The DaVinci Code - by sheer purpose of its subject matter - is a fascinating read. Though Brown's prose is right down there with Grisham and many other commercial thriller writers, the fact that he has taken on such a controversial subject matter, and tied it in with a great conspiracy theory (read, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, a tedious non-fiction book from the eighties and you can see where Brown drew much of his ideas), makes this book a must read.<br />Warning, I'm about to blow the plot line. Do not read further if you don't want to know the ending.............I love the idea that Jesus just might have been married. If you read Mary Magdaline's gospels (which, though discovered earlier than the Nag Hamadi gospels of the other gnostics, are considered part of the gnostics) you must at least entertain this idea. Because these gospels didn't make &quot;the cut&quot; into the bible during the council of Nicea (politics is everything, especially in religion), doesn't mean they're any less spiritual or true.<br />Brown was very smart to tie this element into his story - heck, I wish I had thought of it. Though one word of warning, the beginning of the book stating that everything in there is &quot;true&quot; seems a bit of a sensational ploy. If you want to really argue the point, we don't even know if any of the gospels that inspired the faith of Christianity are &quot;TRUE&quot;. That's why we call it faith.<br />The gnostics and the controversy they inspired have apparently been floating around academic circles for about a decade, and as one academic friend has told me, it takes that long for much of the controversial academia matter to filter down into the public. No one is less or more of a &quot;Christian&quot; by reading this book. I would hope, if nothing else, that the ideas in this book might actually open a few minds to the fact that there is a fine line between myth and religion and that relgion is simply based upon what we want/need to believe.

B000001ELP|1.0|What a disaster ,this isn't music hell i don't what you bloody call it.
0345440900|1.0|This book is positively awful. The whole book has a very condescending tone and the author thinks she is an expert but she is just a nanny with no professional training. She's not a doctor or a sleep or breastfeeding expert. To top it off, she writes in this book with an attitude that parents are stupid and they can't figure out what their baby needs without her help. I regret ever reading this book and trying to implement her ideas with my poor high needs baby. What he really needed was instinctive parenting with AP emphasis to thrive. I'm glad I read the other baby book I recieved as a gift-The Baby Book by Dr. Sears. It was a lifesaver.
B00000AFDW|1.0|Its about time these morons realised they're a circus act
B000084T18|5.0|I often see this album criticized as weak and I just dont understand it.  It's true that his rhyme scheme is simple and he doesn't have much to say (definately not a ghetto poet like Nas or 2Pac) but 50 Cent's delivery is unmatched by anyone in the game.<BR>He has a slick voice, perfect timing, and the fact that he is a true thug adds appeal that can't be faked by other rappers.  Add to that class A production from Dre and Shady, you get one of the best records of the year.  I always keep this CD handy, ready to bump at a moment's notice.
B000002N2P|5.0|This is Green Day's best album. It is darker than their other albums, which serves as an advantage this time around. It makes it more interesting.<br />Musically, it is awsome. The only problem is that I wish Mike showed of his bass skills a bit more (Mike Dirnt is an amazing bassist), however, other than that, it is a masterpiece.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|What happend to Pink?  After Misunderstood I thought Pink was going to take over the world.  This is probably is most disappointing CD of the whole year.  Very diappointing.
B000000W6F|3.0|As a huge Pumpkins fan, I would say that Gish is a strong album with some good songs. I'd even say that, for most bands, an album like that would be their best album. But this is certainly not the best Smashing Pumpkins album.<br />Their debut is one that shows a huge amount of technical ability. By technical ability, I mean that the members of the band can play their instruments better than you would often hear. I always refered to this as the Smashing Pumpkins' Led Zeppelin album because it has the same idea as much of Zeppelin's music: show off on guitar as much as possible. However, it did not display the same emotions as are shown in the Smashing Pumpkins' later albums.<br />It's a good album with some solid songs such as Window Pain, Rhinoceros and Snail. However, it is not their best album by far.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|I could go on to write a book about how this album fails, But I am not.  I will simply say that I expected better material from Alicia.
B000001FTQ|5.0|I found this tape lying around just pickin' up dust, and guess what? I picked this mug up. It is possibly the most sickest tape I've ever heard. It gets me dancing! That's a good thing. I'm sure if you like U2 alot, you'll like this super short but compacted tape/cd to the max. <br />Dance. Dance.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|These guys from Glasgow rock my world!  A little bit Pulp.  A little bit Blondie.  A little bit Hot Hot Heat.  A little bit Blur. A little bit homo.  I hear so many influences, all rolled up into one totally unique band.  The first track \\"Jacqueline\\" is my fave, and starts things off with a bang. Reminds me of the early Jam, except not derivative.  This is fresh and new.  Definitely one of the best records I've heard in years.  This band will show prove to you that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the Strokes are just posers - rich kids in rock clothing.  Franz Ferdinand is the real deal.
B00009RAJH|4.0|Production-wise, this cleaned up remastered version sounds great.  In my opinion it is clearly the weakest of three re-releases.<br />Musically the material isn't nearly as challenging or creatively fulfilling as 'Rumours' or 'Tusk'.  It does demonstrate a good launching point of what was to come.  Interestingly enough one of the best songs isn't even one written by a band member (\\"Blue Letter\\").  \\"Crystal\\" is rehashed from 'Buckingham Nicks' two years earlier than this release.<br />Oddly enough, Christine McVie has some of her biggest hits, but weakest material on this disk.  And I'm sure it's time-related, but if I never hear \\"Landslide\\" again it would be fine with me.  Buckingham has the best outing here, especially with \\"Blue Letter\\" and especially \\"I'm So Afraid\\".  \\"World Turning\\"  is pretty damn good (though becomes a snooze in concert after the first 9 minutes).<br />The extras are ok, but nothing special.  The single versions of \\"Say You Love Me\\" and \\"Rhiannon\\" are on their 3rd release at this point.  The single version of \\"Blue Letter\\" barely strays from the album version.  Only \\"Jam #2\\" kept my interest. Almost a good transition piece from when Fleetwood Mac was a blues band...but not included on the original disk.<br />It's worth it for the fan who wants a superior audio copy of this disk.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Here's the short story on why so many of you are griping about the &quot;re-editing&quot; of Rio in this newest remastered form. Rio was released internationally in 1982 EXACTLY as it appears here. It was a huge hit in Britain and Europe, but not in America. David Kershenbaum was brought in to remix some of the tracks, three of which  ( Hungry Like the Wolf, Hold Back the Rain, and My Own Way ) made it a mini lp ( or EP, as they were then called ) called Carnival ( I still have my copy ). After the extended version of Hungry Like the Wolf became a club and radio hit, Rio was re-released in the US with the extended versions of these three songs, and a very slightly altered Kershenbaum mix of Lonely in Your Nightmare, added to the album. ( Again, I actually have both versions of this LP ) So, to make a long story short, this IS the original, definitive version of the Rio album, in its full glory. If you like the extended versions, I suggest you look for &quot;night Versions&quot; ( now out of print, sadly ), or buy the singles box set, which will contain the remixes. I can also recommend the British cd called Strange Behaviour, which contains an excellent extended ( but not remixed ) version of Planet Earth, as well as a remixed and extended version  of Hold Back the Rain, both of which are unavailable elsewhere, as far as I know. Rio, in and of itself, it a delightful slice of early Eighties dance-pop, with a slightly arty influence. Very highly recommended.
0385510438|5.0|I say bait and switch because being John Grisham, you expect full-blown legal thrillers a la Runaway Jury, The Firm, The Clietnt, etc. But we've seen him try to broaden his range by writing more &quot;setting&quot; and story pieces, rather than potboilers. This trend started with &quot;A Painted House&quot; which was just ok to me, and the thread continued with most of his books after that one where the character's personal story and growth was the theme rather than just the character's response to a situation. As long as the story is good, I don't mind. If you come to this book expecting a potboiler or vintage Grisham, you'll be dissapointed. If you come expecting a good story and seeing if Grisham's gotten better at telling character stories, you will like this book. I think that John Grisham is a storyteller along the lines of Stephen King (different subject matters but still able to grab you and hook you in) and I recommend this book to all those who want an interesting story to read. It is one of his better ones, almost as good as King of Torts.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've seen this series three times already.  Each time I watch it is more compelling that the last.  Regardless of what your views of any war are, this amazing and true story focuses on a &quot;band of brothers&quot;, a group of men who are lumped together as paratroopers in the US Army in WWII.  <br />This series does a great job of capturing the futility of war and the fragile nature of man, capitalizing on the ability of men to grow together and fourish despite overwhelming obstacles and a bleak and dismal life that comes in times of war.  <br />The casting in the movie was awesome.  Each actor captures the character he is portraying, including Donnie Wahlberg, who plays a very convincing 1SG (later 2LT) Lipton.  The same can be said for each of the actors, including David Schwimmer, who plays the part of an incompetent and much-hated company commander.  <br />The combat scenes couldn't have been better and are completely opposite of the kind of pyrotechnics and stage magic you'd see in an action film.  Instead, the series captures the fast-paced tempo of live combat along with the edge-of-your-seat feel that something bad could happen at any moment.<br />I have to warn you now that this movie (very convincingly) glorifies the American soldier for his heroic actions and sacrifices in Europe during WWII (using documented factual events), so if you're one of those who think America can only do wrong, you'd better leave this one on the shelf and get something else...
0385336810|4.0|I read Can You Keep a Secret in about one day, and I really enjoyed it. I found Emma to be a good character- one that I actually enjoyed more than Becky from the Shopaholic series. Becky always made me cringe because of her actions (I can't watch movies like that either), but Emma had a good, solid head on her. I laughed out loud at Emma's actions, and really empathized with her, whereas I always wanted to sit Becky down and give her a good talking to.<br />The plot was a tad predictable, but so were all the Shopoholic books, and that didn't stop me either! I really enjoy British chic-lit (it's my guilty pleasure), and I hope that Sophie Kinsella keeps writing fun books with engaging characters.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I'm amazed at the negative reviews this CD has been getting.  Sarah never sounded better than she does on &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  Every single one of the songs are absolutely amazing.  &quot;Fallen&quot; and &quot;Train Wreck&quot; are probably my two favorite tracks, but there isn't a bad song on the album.  The only (minor) complaint I have is that the album is pretty short (under 45 minutes) and I wish we would have been treated to an extra song or two.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Requiem for a dream is the greatest movie about drug addiction I have ever seen. It depicts the life of four individuals as they spiral further and further down from their addiction. It is so detailed and graphic in its depiction that it is truly frightening. Although it is utterly brilliant, buying this DVD for repeated viewing is overkill. If you watch it more than once, it is useless. Everyone, go out and rent this movie, watch it to get the experience, but don't buy it. You won't want to see it more than once. It gets four stars for being a brilliant film, but the purpose of buying the DVD is so you can watch it over and over again, which with this movie, you don't want to do.
0385504209|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone - it suitable for all ages.<br />Dan Brown has done a great job. As the grandson of a Mason and whose family members have been in other secret societies, I am glad Brown has brought them to light in a serious, but educating way. Brown uses a hybrid socratic method to keep the reader thinking ahead, while mixing puns, puzzles, and trivia to keep the reader focused on the current story. Brown uses many literary devices well and weaves many biblical allegories into the story itself. I commend the publisher for taking the chance on printing a thriller that has both a serious intellectual investigation and which has a more challenging style than is usual.<br />The story is tightly written and the author does not stray from the plot or the main characters at all. Wondering who is bad and not bad keeps one guessing until the end. The book does not have a bibliography, but the author alludes to critical works on the subject he writes about. The reader can then go read the scholarly works.<br />One thing missing from the book is the political ramifications for the Romans in allowing the unification of the Jews ( and thus Palestine ) such a marriage of Jesus and Mary could have brought about. Another angle would be the economic unification brought about by such a union - and the other economic interests that would have opposed this. Jesus was no ordinary leader and his death at a young age before he could become established and solidify his base no doubt was welcomed by many who preferred the status quo.<br />I am constantly amazed at the number of Christians I meet who evangelize, but who are not familiar with the Masons or the Knights Templar or their role in preserving Western Civilization.
B000002AZX|5.0|Leonard Cohen's songs are awesome to listen to.  His talents as a musician and writer are apparent in any of his songs.  In my opinion, there isn't a bad one in the bunch.  I'm no musical expert, but I don't think there could have been an improvement on any of his songs.  His music is not without religious influence, but I'm hard-pressed to determine what kind of religious message he's trying to convey.  <br />I first heard Leonard Cohen's music on \\"Pump up the volume\\", a movie starring Christian Slater about a high-school student running a pirate radio station.  In a couple of the scenes of the movie, Slater's character plays some of Leonard Cohen's songs, including \\"If it be your will.\\"  <br />His songs have also been used in popular movies like Shrek, which features \\"Hallelujah,\\" sang by someone else.
B00005JLRT|4.0|This film had some of the best fast n' furious action scenes I've ever seen in Trek, tv or film. It was exciting, kept you on the edge of your seat, but felt kinda stiff. the characters felt like they were working as actors, and not like good pals having some fun. It felt like they were &quot;OK, I'll read my lines,gimme my check and I'm outta here&quot; type of feeling. The warmth and camraderie from the earlier films and tv show were somewhat lacking. It's good this was the last Trek for TNG guys. Some were beginning to hit the middle age plump-up like those of the original series' films did. Good, but overall it could have been better.<BR>P.S. Thought-if data is an android with an artificial &quot;skin&quot;, then he should look the same in Nemesis as he did episode 1 of TNG;since he definitly appears older, then it's time to retire TNG from the movies and hand it off to the DS9 guys.

Anne frank and Gerda they seemed surreal to me...this...this was different those actors they weren't really fimilar to me. They seemed real. They made me see. I cried, because I saw.

If you've already seen it go watch it again, and remember life is what you make it, and even in the darkest of places life is beautiful.
1573301183|5.0|Being a casual fan of Alice in Chains and a major fan of grunge, I bought this DVD on a bit of a whim, not really knowing what to expect. Let me just tell you I was blown away.<br />Listening to their other songs, I can say that the unplugged renditions they give here are their best ever. For all their musical talent, some of their production sometimes seemed to be lacking, with either the vocals or instruments being drowned out. In this performance, everything seems to blend together so perfectly it seems odd to hear the non-acoustic versions of these songs.<br />If you were thinking about getting one of their CDs, I suggest you try this DVD first. Skip the CD version of this album, because actually seeing them perform completely changes the experience. Now, 2 years after the death of Layne Staley, this beautiful music is more important than ever.
B00003CXC7|4.0|This is a great film that discusses the mystery of perception. James Stewart plays a photographer confined to a wheelchair, and, because he is bored, he voyeuristically examines the lives of his neighbors in the apartment building. We only see these neighbors through his eyes. Therefore, when he assumes that the man across the courtyard has murdered his invalid wife, at first no one wants to investigate his theory, especially his detective friend. But the clues seem to pile up, leading Stewart's girlfriend and nurse (a wonderfully witty role played by Thelma Ritter) to lure the man from his apartment to investigate further. The climax is powerful, true to Hitchcockian form.<br />Hitchcock's films are quite different from suspense films made today. The primary difference is the method in which Hitch crafts suspense. It's slow--on purpose. The climax is more powerful because the viewer builds up tension throughout the first 3/4 of the film. In this movie, Hitch's goal is not to shock or horrify viewers, but put them on the edge of their seats in anxious expectation of the climax. That, in my opinion, makes a great suspense thriller.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Oskar Schindler,was a Nazi, german war businessman who employed as many Jews as possible in his factories so they would be spared of executions. It is another movie on Jews but this is the very best after \\"Life is beautiful\\". Watching this movie means getting through the TV screen into WWII and automatically become a haunted Jew.<BR>Directed by a great director. Played by born-talented actors, this movie is a MUST to every home that cares on building a better and safer world for us all.<br />\\"ENJOY\\" the moral story as the movie \\"can not\\" possibly be enjoyed!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Although this film is simple, it speaks volumes in depth. People who don't &quot;get it&quot; probably hardly ever &quot;get it&quot; so they shouldn't hold this fantastic film responsible for their inabilties. I thought Bill Murray was brilliant and Scarlett Johansson was very impressive, being so young but proving herself as a very mature actor. SO if you don't feel like thinking and feeling, just cruise on by and hit up the romantic comedy section.

B000003TA4|4.0|My friend told me I had to listen to this album, so I bought it, and now it's always in my cd player.  Whether you like heavy metal, grunge, classic rock, or even pop, Nirvana has something for you as the classic alt. rock band.
6305537321|5.0|Many viewers and critics have said that this film doesn't have much of a plot, mainly because there isn't a lot of &quot;action.&quot; However, most of the action occurs in the characters' souls, and that is where the plot of the story lies. <br />Audrey Hepburn, my favorite film actress, stars as Holly, a call girl searching for the ultimate sugar daddy. George Peppard is Paul, the kept man upstairs who becomes Audrey's brother-figure. When Paul begins to fall in love with Holly, he begins to see her superficiality. Is she really who she says she is? Or has she just tricked herself into believing it? Paul attempts to uncover the layers of Holly's soul, and in the process he discovers some secrets in her past. Simultaneously, Paul realizes the sickening situation in his own life, and ends the liasion with wealthy matron Patricia Neal, turning his energy to writing a book about Holly. <br />The main point of the film is this: genuine love is tangible, but many people desire the wrong kind, the easy kind, the physical kind, and forget about the love of the soul and heart. Paul is patient with Holly's flighty ways, something that many viewers should take notes on and apply to their own relationships. Paul gives love, not necessarily expecting it in return ... and I won't spoil the end (although it's in direct contrast to Capote's novel). Overall, this is a sweet, tender film about love, and the talented actors envelop us into their plight. Great classic romance, but not sappy.
B00009XITP|4.0|Th I liked it a lot, except for one huge problem. Amanda Bynes, Daphne Reynolds in the movie, can't act to save her life. With the huge launching of all these new teen actresses that are all the rage now, it makes sense that there's going to one in the bunch that sucks. Well, Amanda Bynes is that one. She was really awful in the movie, and it would have been much better if someone else had stepped in. She was trying to act all cute, but ended up just looking fake. Plus, I really felt that they were trying to take advantage of her all-too-cute body by squeezing her into skin-tight shirts that left absolutely nothing to the imagination All in all, it was a sweet movie though, and I like the fact that she didn't have to change who she was just to please her father. The plot was a little silly though; some aspects of it just couldn't have happened.Oh, and by the way, Oliver James, who plays Ian Wallace, so incredibly good-looking.
B0001AP12G|2.0|Over all, the entire album was a great disappointment for me.<BR>He destroys the tightest beats with his weak raps.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|after watching i found myself cheering mr buble. mr buble is a singer extroardinaire and an exemplary entertainer. i appreciate artists who take pride in their work, and don't have attitude and buble is one of those. as an avid collector of music dvds, this one is a premium production. the sound quality is top notch - his live is better then memorex (if you can remember that expression you'll guess my age)<BR>i'm buying this dvd for friends and family, it's a 'can't go wrong' choice as buble is just the tonic to perk up anyones movie watching night. 3 standing o's and 5 big stars!!!!!!!!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the greatest bands to come out in the market for the last 10 years. With powerful, yet soulful vocals provided by Amy Lee's wonderful pipes, the band has nowere to go but up. This band came as a big surprise for me. When I first heard their single &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; on the radio, I thought &quot;Oh! Linkin Park, again? Their better than what I thought they were.  A duet with a female vocalist. Who is she?&quot;  I asked my sister, but she didn't know. SO the great mystery continued of who this band was. Was it really linkin park (which I didnt really like, then)? nope. It was Evanescence! I discovered that a few weeks later, when the Mexican people learned how to pronounce EVANESCENCE. <BR>Anyway, Evanescence really expanded my horizons, music wise. I have to admit that I really didn't like Linkin Park or anything that resembled them, before Evanescence. Now, Linkin Park, Evanescence, Apocalliptica and many other bands are favourites of mine. <BR>Anyway, this is how I rate the tracks:<BR>Going Under - a good song, gets a little tireing after a while, though<BR>Bring me to Life - One of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. I never get tired of this one<BR>Everybody's fool - great song about posers and lyers<BR>My Immortal - I love every version of this song. The original, the band version, the acoustic, a live version, and even this even older version of the song with alternate lyrics... this is a great song<BR>Haunted - self-explanatory. The whole song is simply haunting<BR>Tourniquet - great lyrics. Questions the matter of suicide. &quot;Will I be denied Christ?&quot;<BR>Imaginary - eeirie, but fresh and new<BR>Taking Over Me - great. My best friends favourite, I don't know how to describe it...<BR>Hello - a touching and spine chilling song about the death of Amy Lee's sister... you can feel the sorrow in her voice<BR>My Last Breath - My favourite. The best song in the whole album. its the combination of those beautiful lyricswith that mystic voice... great<br />Whisper... No coments, it's good but not my style...
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is quite possibly the best album of 1995, and Smashing Pumpkins' best. Siamese Dream, is good. Gish, is good. Adore, is not so good but anyway, Mellon Collie is amazing. This CD will actually give you mood swings and flashbacks. 1979 will have you feel young again and kind of happy, and freely singing along, whereas, Bullet With Butterfly Wings will have you dark and slowly humming along. Beautiful will have you watching The Color Purple, and sipping tea. It will make you very, very sensitive, yet sad. Well, if you haven't heard this album, do not walk to get it, do not run to get it, fly and get it, or even better, float to get it, because it WILL DEFINITELY be worth your money, and you'll be listening for quite some time.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I have watched so many movies that consisted of vampires and most of them have been so lousy that a few times I've felt tears line my eyes. But this film has to be the most beautiful, most truthful, and most amazing vampire movie ever created, and I can't thank Geffen and Warner enough for it. Even now, when I watch all these horrid vampire films that are continually made, I always know there was at least one vampire film that took my heart as well as my breath. The movie is darkly and seductively lit, just like the mood always is, and the actors fit the setting perfectly. No obnoxious, idiotic vamps here, but actually serious, compassionate and real characters. If you are a lover of vampires, and even more, a lover of the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice who wrote the novel to this movie, you will absolutely love both the actors and the way the movie is shown. Unlike other vamp movies, the vampires act their age- you know, mature- and the actors are supremely gorgeous. Even Tom Cruise with all that makeup on and blonde locks still appears just as sexy as ever- and do I even have to mention Antonio Banderas with that long hair? Well despite my drooling, there are many great actors playing in this movie. There's Tom Cruise as I've said, but at first glance you'll probably not even know because he has molded himself almost to the perfection of the character Lestat the way Anne made him appear in the novel, and has the exact personality of the vain and careless Lestat. And then there's the everlasting Brad Pitt who plays the sad, mournful Louis, and honestly, when you see this film, you'll see Brad Pitt is the best man to play this role. Antonio Banderas is spectacular as Armand- honestly, despite his age, Antonio is the splitting image of the ancient regretless vampire, and there's Christian Slater who is Malloy, the boy who interviews Louis as he pours out his whole story on tape. Then who can forget the cynical yet witty Stephen Rea who plays a head vampire actor inArmand's Parisian theater,and little Kirsten Dunst, who played the tormented child? All perfect actors who made the movie a gorgeous gem. You will not be disappointed with them I assure you.<BR>This film is a lovely and yet exhilerating piece of work that speaks of the vampire Louis who has lived many decades and wishes just out of sheer want to tell his story. So he picks an interviewer who is nameless in this movie but if you read the Chronicles will know as Malloy. Up in an apartment in San Francisco these two sit in the room, Malloy taping Louis as he tells his long and sordid tale. He goes right to the punch and tells you how he was 'born to darkness'. It appears that for time sake they change the story around a bit at the beginning and instead of telling you his brother died and he blamed himself for it as Anne wrote in the novel, they tell you he lost his wife in childbirth, and it deeply upsets him and places him in a deep state of depression that is just teetering on he being suicidal.<BR>Then Tom Cruise comes in as the striking character he is and instantly you are watching Lestat convert Louis to what he is, a vampire. Then the movie goes deep as the duo fight constantly and then convert a daughter, Claudia, that Louis loved ultimately, possibly an outlet for the pain he felt by losing his real child years back. Then as he travels the world, seeking for vampires, Armand comes to his life and tells him the facts of life from a vampire's angle, entrancing Louis ever more deeply and yet also leaving him more bitter than before, but always still feeling.<BR>This movie tells a story not just of vampires, but also of humans as well. It tells the truth of human life and how sensitive it truly is, and that some people see life much more differently than others. It also teaches you though about vampires and how if they exist this is how they would be. There are a few that are rude and vain like Lestat, and then there are some that are compassionate and loving likeLouis, and then there are some that are just tormented and lost like Armand. <BR>The makeup and costume affects were excellent, the settings were lovely, and the story is perfect for just a relaxing night alone on the couch. And although I did hear some rumors that there were a few disputes between the actors on set, especially between Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, they sure hid it well and made this a movie to be proud of.<BR>I recommend this movie to all viewers alike, for it's a movie meant for everyone to see, not just supernatural lovers. I guarantee you, you'll be laughing, gasping, and crying throughout the entire movie. It's just that good.
B00005JMX4|5.0|Saw this movie at a sneak preview..loved it. There is a freshness to the movie and it's character's despite so much of the movie being associated to Porn.

B00005JKGZ|5.0|This two DVD set is so terrific, I hardly know where to start.<br />The film itself, which has received another remastering, from the LaserDisc release ten years ago, never looked or sounded as good. I doubt if the original release had a DD 5.1 real stereo soundtrack. And this not only applies to the songs, but the entire score. This gives the Halloween sequence a realistic quality that makes it truly terrifying. A great visit as to what Halloween used to be before candy. Super closed captioning as well, along with terrific audio commentaries by those who knew best, including Margaret O'Brien. The soundtrack is also available for playback, minus vocals, so you can sing along, or just listen to the terrific stereo sound.<br />The second DVD contains not one, but two different documentaries on the making of this classic film. Plus the short &quot;Bubbles&quot;, which the Gumm Sisters appeared in in 1929, long before Garland was a star. Also there is a 1966 TV pilot, in color, with Celeste Holm, Shelley Fabares, and Reta Shaw. One very interesting note, is that the actor that appeared in this TV pilot that played the &quot;boy next door&quot;, is named Blodgett! All Judy fans will recognize that name from the famed A Star is Born. A bit of coincidence?<br />There is also a re-creation of the deleted song from the film, &quot;Boys and Girls Like You and Me&quot;, plus a very rare &quot;soundie&quot; featuring the songwriters, and the very excellent &quot;Becoming Judy&quot; with Robert Osborne, which includes many of Garland's film trailers. It goes on to explain why trailers are called that, and gives tremendous insight into the publicity or exploitation department of MGM.<br />There is more..........the original Lux Radio Theatre production of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, with the original cast.<br />I couldn't recommend this release more, and there are lots more extras that I did not mention. A super job from all involved -- fully expected from a musical of thiscaliber. Highly recommended!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|O disco  timo!Embora o grupo estivesse se desfazendo, com crises, brigas e todo tipo de jogo pessoal, o esprito de quatro msicos competentes, que gostavam do velho e bom rock'n'roll sobrepuja o clima irritante deflagrado mais no arquivos existentes em vdeo do que no prprio disco. um disco alegre, apesar de tudo. &quot;One After 909&quot; e &quot;Two of Us&quot;  um dos momentos mais gostosos, pois podemos ouvir Paul e John cantando como nos velhos tempos. As verses de &quot;I've got a feelling&quot; e &quot;Don't Let me Down&quot; so incrivelmente empolgantes, fora a prola de George Harrison &quot;For you blue&quot; - um delicioso blues, bem ao estilo de Harrison.No sei se por costume, gosto mais da verso antiga de &quot;The long and winding road&quot;, mesmo com toda a pompa orquestral exageradamente dramtica; da mesma forma, prefiro a verso antiga de &quot;Let it be&quot;, na qual John faz um solo de guitarra convincente e nesta gravao ele supera Harrison -  um momento feliz para Lennon, que nunca se preocupou em ser um bom guitarista. &quot;Get Back&quot; ficou mais curta e estranha, pois como fan, esperava que Paul retomasse a msica depois do breque, mas, ao contrrio, a msica acaba, deixando um gostinho no ar... no gostei disso. Enfim, para um fan da gerao ps-beatles, o disco Let it Be...Naked  um dos melhores j lanados neste ltimos anos em que cada vez mais aparecem artistas sem compromisso com a qualidade.

B000060MWU|3.0|as a film id give this 5 stars as a dvd, 3...for some reason the image quality is barely above the vhs version and the version i bought was the pan-scan version....i read somewhere that theres a possiblity of a full fleged american version coming out soon but until then this is as good as it gets....
B0000VAFO0|4.0|There are reasons this movie was never nominated for an Academy Award.  But absolutely none of those reasons stopped the movie from being immersive and entertaining.<br />Will it end up being shown on TCM?  Most likely not.<br />Was it a fun 2 hours?  You betcha.<br />I hesitate to give examples, as that would ruin some of the experience.  Suffice it to say that by the time I was far enough in the movie for the plot to begin it's twisting, I was so immersed in the feel of the flick that I never saw any of them coming.<br />Any movie that can do that impresses me.
0385510438|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book, in that it did not follow his usual genre.  I did not read reviews ahead of time or I would not have purchased the book.  I am an avid reader of his books and buy them as soon as they are on the market.  The jacket of the book was very misleading.  I kept waiting for the trial to be over so we could get on with the riveting story of the revenge issue.  It never got off the ground.  I almost did not finish the book.  The redeeming factor in the book is the relationship with the last juror, which was the whole point of the book.  It should have been advertised that way on the book jacket.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Guns had so many great songs!  This is just a way for the record company to make up for the money they have put in to Chinese Democracy(they have to pay the gunners less for covers) an Axl Rose led solo project.  <BR>Start with <BR>Appetite for Destruction if you like that move on to Use your Illusion 1 and 2<br />Wheres AXL????????
B000002HRE|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could say this album was awful. It's AWESOME!!<br />Metallica's lyrics are the best I've ever heard...they can seriously write! For once, just listen to the lyrics and try to get the meaning of the song. All of them have a meaning - a good one too.<br />Their music all sounds different, and the lead vocals kick ass. I really think everyone should try this album out! It's easily one of their best, along with the black album and ride the lightning. metallica does NOT suck!! (and neither does ozzy. :-\)
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck's 1937 novella OF MICE AND MEN is one of the most poignant stories of friendship between men ever written in American Literature. It is also among the most important illustrations of the desperate feelings shared by those who lived in the Depression-era Dust Bowl regions of California. The story of the protective relationship between small, street-smart George Milton and large, child-like Lennie Small still fascinates us today; it has been made into no less than three feature films, the last one being only a dozen years ago, and it remains one of the five most-read books in Junior High, Intermediate and Middle Schools today around the country.<br />At a spare 107 pages, this book is short on words but high on symbolism and feeling. John Steinbeck was a master of getting his point across simply. He also excelled at creating simple but sharply-drawn characters who lived, walked and talked like those with whom he had come into contact in real life. When one reads a book like OF MICE AND MEN, he or she is transported back to those times, by an author who actually lived the life of many of his protagonists, including the ones in this story. Yes, John Steinbeck did dig wells in his native Salinas during the Dust-Bowl period. He then gave us some of the most compelling and readable pieces of literature in our nation's history, and OF MICE AND MEN is among the most important of his works.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED; ESPECIALLY FOR AGES 12-14
B00005JMSE|4.0|Based on the Dark Horse comic, HELLBOY is probably one of the more unusual superhero films around today.  In a prologue set in World War II, the U.S. Army foils a Nazi plot to open an other dimensional portal and unleash monster fiends upon the world.  However, an infant demon slips through into our world.  Taking pity on him, government scientist Professor Broom raises the tyke as his own.  60 years later, we find the demon all grown-up and fighting paranormal menaces for a secret U.S. government agency.  However, Hellboy finds himself batting not only the evils of his past, but his own feelings for Liz, a fellow freak with pyrotechnic powers.<br /> Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the demon with a blue-collar attitude towards his job.  In many ways, he comes across as your local garbage man or plumber with his world-weary view towards the many monsters he faces. His snappy comebacks are especially amusing.  Perlman?s costume and make-up also reinforce the image with his floppy raincoat and filed-down horns, which resemble goggles more than anything.  Selma Blair is touching as the somewhat sullen object of Hellboy?s affections, while  John Hurt brings an added amount of warmth as the elder Professor Broom.  Rupert Evans is solid as the young FBI agent introduced to this unusual situation.  As the evil Rasputin, Karel Rodin somewhat underplays the part, making him a rather bland bad guy.  Doug Jones, with the voice of David Hyde Pierce, are delightful as fish-man Abe Sapien.  Lending solid support is Jeffrey Tambor as Hellboy?s antagonistic boss.<br />Despite having a lower budget than most films of its type, the special effects are definitely better than average with snaky haired monsters providing menace and a complaining zombie half-corpse providing laughs. HELLBOY is a fast-paced, fun film that definitely will draw in fans of the cult comic, while the irreverent attitude will appeal to action fans in general.  It doesn?t matter if you?re familiar to the comic or not, this film is definitely a fun time, and as such, is one that I definitely recommend.ic or not, this film is definitely a fun time, and as such, is one that I definitely recommend.
B00018D44U|2.0|After the lovely &quot;Sunrise,&quot; the album descends into a morass of slow, doddering songs without any hint of charm.
B000062XGG|1.0|This has been one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I know some people find hidden references to great movies, or find some of the lines in this movie funny.  To me it's a movie directed at audiences with an average IQ of around 70, no one to exceed 90.  Science fiction is supposed to be somewat feasible, or at least give some explanation of why things are happening.  This movie drops stuff on us like a virus downloading into an alien system and destroying their computers (War of the Worlds?).  And the moment when I was about to leave the theater is when they tell an aussie that the americans are counterattacking and he says &quot;Twas about time!&quot;.  Who on earth thinks those lines and who are they directing them to?  If you value two hours of your time, don't waste them on this movie.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" was a romantic movie that showed me a good time. In contrast to most shallow movies in the theaters these days, the novel-adapted movie was moving and rich in meaning. Moreover, the picturesque scenes reminded me of the classic romance \\"Gone with the Wind\\" as both of them are about the Civil War and how people deal with it. Of course, it is impossible to be as good as GWTW, but a finely-made movie during these years.<br />War's ugliness and brutality was vividly portrayed in the movie. The screenplay starts with Inman, the male protagonist, painstakingly fighting in the war. The civil war undermined his nascent relationship with Ada. The war went on, regardless of the injured and dying soldier, not to mention their wretched families. On the other hand, people of the same union did not always cooperate with each other but cast greedy eyes on their comrades' possessions. Violence made people display the most sinister side of their personality, so I was glad that there is no war around me, or people would have to bear the sufferings depicted in the film.<br />The hesitancy people in old times had when expressing their feelings was beauteous. Ada, the female protagonist, and Inman loved each other with equal passion, yet neither knew the proper way to let it out. The implication held a fascinating beauty to me, for people in modern times do not bother to conceal their feelings. <br />Brilliant music was composed along with the film. In the movie, the music is peaceful and sweet when the shot moves to Cold Mountain. The songs are particularly beautiful in romantic moments as they served to accentuate the elegance of love. On the other hand, they are also enjoyable to listen to out of the movie. When the two theme songs, ¡§You Will Always Be My Ain Love\\" and \\"Scarlet Tide\\" were performed live at the Academy Awards this year, I was stunned by the magnificent melodies.<br />In sum, \\"Cold Mountain\\" is sorrowfully beautiful. It makes me reflect on my own life as well as appreciating the fantastic scenery shown. Even though the background was set more than a century ago, modern people would still experience the same frustrations and struggled for solutions as ancient people did.
0061015725|4.0|The story keeps you turning the pages. I don't want to spoil this for anyone, but would like to compare thoughts with those who have read the book. Chrichton builds the tension through a lot of surprises, but are they really surprises? It's an interesting mental game played on the reader. Aside from that, it is a refreshing story.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|...so you either like her or you don't. I am one of the few people that have always been in between. Some of her songs are fun for a while, but there's only so many times I can listen to those songs. The only thing I love about Britney is the performance she puts on... I recently saw her in concert and it was AWESOME! She's an entertainer first and foremost, and a really fascinating, interesting one at that. She can dance around and she knows how to 'shock and awe.' She's a lot of fun but there isn't really anything very musically redeeming about her songs, so don't take her too seriously. I kind of like &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Shadow&quot; but other than that... it's just Britney.
B000089CJI|5.0|Basically, I can't live at the moment without listening to this album at least once a day.  I'm not a huge fan of techno music; it has no soul.  But this music, combined with the amazing vocals and lyrics, has a soul so deep you want to dive into it.  Favorites: &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; and &quot;Natural Anthem.&quot;<br />My friend gave me her copy of the CD with the words, &quot;If you don't like this I can no longer like you.&quot;  Well, obviously we're still friends.  I've been encouraging everyone I know to buy it.  This is how music should make you feel.
0385510438|3.0|I expected more of a trial book due to title and cover.  The book was a mixture of the trial and life in the south.  I did enjoy it but let down because of false expectations. <br />I believe that Mr. Grisham does a wonderful job of makeing you feel like you know his characters.  I love Mrs. Callie and her family.  <br />Even with this three star review I will by Mr. Grisham's next book also.  He always keeps me interested.
0385510438|1.0|I am completely mystified by the reviewers who gave this book more than one star.<BR>Mr.Grisham obviously wrote this in the hours between breakfast and lunch AND on a Sunday after church services.<BR>I got so tired of listening (book on tape) to his descriptions about FOOD. Ok, the author was hungry -- we get it.<BR>The church visitations were also useless (and there were a lot of those!).  And gee, got any political convictions you'd like to share?  ZZZzzzzzz.<BR>Michael Beck did a fine job as reader (although Harry Rex sounded like he was speaking with large wad of chew stuffed in his mouth).  I just didn't like any of the characters (Willie was such a pompous so-and-so).<BR>This was not a courtroom drama or a revenge thriller. It just went on and on and on.<BR>I think someone needs to nuke Clanton right off the map.
B000002UDB|5.0|Few could argue that &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was the worst Beatles film ever made. The acting was shoddy, the plot was bad and the cinematoraphy just didn't work. But if there was one good thing about the film, it was the music, which is fully represented on the soundtrack, which was # 1 for 8 weeks in 1968. To prove how successful The Beatles were at this point, &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was still in the Top 5 the week it hit the top spot.<br />The album starts off with the blaring horns of the title track, featuring John Lennon's carnival barking - voice and some really cool vocals. Next comes one of Paul's best songwriting outputs, &quot;Fool On The Hill&quot;. Paul's talents are fully shown here, both lyrically and vocally. Following is &quot;Flying&quot;, a groovy instrumental that was written by all four Beattles. &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; is an abstarct and incredibly vivid George Harrison. Next is &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, a jangly Paul composition. John's surrealistic piece &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; is next, as brilliant now as it was 37 years ago. The song is surprisingly one of the lowest - charting Beatles singles ever, peaking at 56. &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; (# 1 for 3 weeks in December 1967) is a great physcadellic rocker. &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (# 8 in 1967) is all John, and is porobably his best composition of this period. &quot;Penny Lane&quot; (# 1 for one week in early 1967)is all Paul, and is one of my favorite Beatles sogs ever. &quot;Baby You're A Rich Man&quot; (# 34 in 1967) is really trippy, with its Indian beats. Closing it is &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; (# 1 in 1967), a song whose message still rings true 37 years later.<br />I highly recommend this album. While not as good as other Beatles albums, it certainly is flawlessly done. But I strongly suggest skipping the movie.
B00004SVID|5.0|Pink Floyd's The Wall was, for me, one of their more difficult albums to persuade myself to purchase because not every song is Another Brick in the Wall or Run Like Hell. So I bought the live album instead, because on the live version ALL of the songs are played with a lot more passion and intensity. Songs like Bring the Boys back Home and Vera have a lot more life and...well, music to them! In fact, every single song is better than the corresponding version in the studio album except, I think, The Happiest Days of Our Lives/Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2 because instead of a psychotic Scottish-sounding school teacher, it's Roger Waters shouting. But chances are you already have Another Brick in the Wall, anyways, and if you're going to get The Wall, it should be a version that you can enjoy completely and enjoy in one sitting. Besides, Run Like Hell is GREAT! Roger Waters has an insane scream that makes you wonder if it's even possible to scream like that.  The song, like Comfortably Numb and other really really good songs, is extended--which is excellent for songs that you never want to end. So get The Wall because it's a cornerstone to Pink Floyd, and get this version because it's much more enjoyable than the studio version.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I wrote a review for this CD 1 year ago, and let me tell you, I love this album even more now. This CD truly is amazing. Madonna really is the most talented, original, and mature artist ever. This woman has the most amazingly gorgeous voice and writes simple but awesome lyrics. This CD is one of the best CD's ever created. The maturity here is evident on EVERY song and really shows one thing Madonna seems to have above everyone else - this factor you really can't identify... it's an awesome and amazing factor. I'm seeing Madonna in concert on June 8th and I really can't wait! My favorite song on the CD HAS changed however, Intervnetion is my favorite song now. It's gorgeous, extremely well-written, she sounds amazing on it, it's extremely mature, and just an awesome song all around. Buy this CD. It is a masterpiece, and will remain along with Erotica and Ray Of Light as works of art that never seem to get old. Highlights:<br />American Life<br />Hollywood<br />I'm So Stupid<br />Love Profusion<br />Nothing Fails<br />Intervention<br />Mother & Father<br />Easy Ride<br />Madonna is my 2nd favorite artist (Britney being my first - her music is so amazing and fun, I love it) - but Madonna really is the most talented, awesome, knowledged, mature, intricate person alive. She's done so many great things in the 20 years she's been famous (such as support gay rights) and opened up doors for so many people in this world. Really, buy this CD, Madonna put her all into it and it really shows. 5/5 stars.
B000069HK2|5.0|this album is very good... at first i didnt really like it but now that i have listened to it, it has impressed me... this is not a gay punk band or a heavy rock band that thinks that they are cool if they swear... this is the only album of theres that i own but i am thinking of buying one...
B000002UAX|2.0|This album is really interesting to listen to from beginning to end - about twice.  After that, the repeated plays for most people revolve around the strongest 10 or 12 songs, including Back in the USSR, Revolution, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  Those songs comprise about a third of the album, thus the rating of 2 stars. A better way to buy these songs is on the 67-70 Greatest Hits album, which admittedly contains a lot of weak Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour songs, but they are better than the other songs on the White Album.
B00000ILBK|4.0|Curse, what curse?  Almost as good as First Contact!<br />A number of movie reviewers in the past have talked about a curse on the even numbered Star Trek movies, I think this all started with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, but this movie breaks that curse!<br />The storyline concerns a race of peaceful people, the Baku, on a planet capable of rejuvenating life and keeping it's inhabitants eternally youthful, but a group of  Federation officers want to remove them from their planet \\"for the greater good of millions who would benefit from Baku's fountain of youth-like powers\\"  However, the Federation has a Prime Directive,  forbidding  the Federation from becoming involved with the planet's inhabitants and when Picard is ordered by a representative, Admiral Dougherty, to allow the removal of these people, effectively breaking the Prime Directive, Picard and crew rebel against this order and take matters into their own hands to help the citizens of the planet . As well, there is Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who presents a threat to the Baku and the crew of the Enterprise-E..<br /> The Special effects, as in the last movie, are outstanding.  The action scenes are plentiful and the film's \\"embarrassing sequences\\" often referred to in other movie reviews I've read are actually very humorous, especially Deanna Troi's remark about Dr. Crusher's \\"boobs\\" firming up nicely and Worf`s Klingon \\"puberty\\".  It was a little annoying that the relationship between Anij (Donna Murphy) and Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) didn't go as far it could have, especially in light of the romances Capt. Kirk had on the original Star Trek series.  As well, the friendship that developed between the boy and Data was cute, serving it's purpose in eliminating the boy's fear of androids, after Data goes haywire in the beginning of the movie.  It was good to see Commander Riker without his beard for once ( he shaves it off for Deanna early on), as he's had it since the 1988-89 season of Star Trek: TheNext Generation.  The picture and sound quality of this DVD is excellent.<br />Extras -- The DVD has two trailers and a five minute behind the scenes look at the movie,  but nothing much else, still it's a pleasant little timewaster.<BR> <BR>In the end, I enjoyed Star Trek: Insurrection, and unlike what some other movie reviewers have noted, it seemed very theatrical doesn't play like a TV Movie at all.  In fact, I would have to say that there was as much action in this movie as there was in First Contact.  In conclusion, it's as good as First Contact,  highly recommended to all Star Trek fans.<br />This review refers to the Widescreen DVD, which is enhanced for 16 x 9 viewing.  <br />To everyone who reads this,  remember to keep in mind that this is only my opinion, don't take it to heart.   In the final equation all that really matters is what YOU thought of the movie!  If you enjoyed it, that's all that matters!
B00009V7RF|2.0|I bought this CD off of amazon.com.  I bought it just for the &quot;hey mama&quot; song. When i heard it on the radio it was one cool jam and I really got into it, but when I finally got the CD I put it right on that song and it is a totally different version. it is ok, but the new version is much better. just to let you know if you are buying this CD for that song you may want to hear it first to see if you like it. i had to learn the hard way!
6305127638|4.0|I found this movie to be as good a movie sequel to the two part \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" episode  of Star Trek: The Next Generation  as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn was to \\"Space Seed\\" in the original Star Trek. In this movie, the Borg Collective, led by their sadistic Queen (Alice Krige) (who once captured Jean-Luc Picard in the \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\" and converted him to be one of their own), returns to try to take over Earth .  The crew of the Enterprise-E must go back in time to prevent The Borg from altering Earth's history to suit their purposes.  The Borg try to change the timeline of history by trying to prevent one famous inventor, Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell), from flying his warp-capable spaceship and making first contact with Vulcans.  By the way, the Zefram Cochrane in this movie is totally different from the character portrayed by Glenn Corbett in the \\"Metamorphosis\\" episode of  the original Star Trek.<br />The Special effects in this movie were outstanding.  The action sequences I felt were superbly done, especially the fight between the Borg Queen and Picard. There was great acting by all involved, including Patrick Stewart, James Cromwell, and Alfrie Woodard. Alice Krige was exceptional as the Borg Queen.. <br />The picture quality in this DVD was excellent. Sound quality was also very good.<BR> <BR>Extras --  Teaser trailer and Theatrical trailer are included, nothing else. However, despite this, I  highly recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans.<br />To everyone who reads this, keep in mind that this is only my opinion, don't take it to heart.   In the final equation all that really matters is what YOU thought of the movie.  If you enjoyed it, that's all that matters!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I am a big movie buff but this was as shallow as a puddle. I have never walked out of a movie at the theatre but I couldn't sit through another minute of this one. It had the maturity for children but the sexual content for adults. It was zipping all over the place and I felt like I was watching an old B movie.!!!SUCKED!!!(...)
B00008NV4I|4.0|A fitting farewell to the Next Generation<br />Counsellor Troi and Cmdr. Will Riker finally get married, Data meets his other \\"brother\\" B4, and Capt. Picard meets a clone in this, the last film to feature the original cast of the second TV series to bear the Star Trek name. As it was planned to be the last movie, even Wesley Crusher {Wil Wheaton) makes a cameo appearance during the wedding sequence (he actually was supposed to have had more scenes, but they were edited out as the movie was initially overlong), when I first heard about this, I was very annoyed.  I hope someday Paramount will release a \\"Collector's Edition\\" of this movie, with the deleted scenes included.<br />The core of the plot has the Romulans finally proposing peace to the Federation, but it's all in vain as Picard's clone Shizon, (played brilliantly by Tom Hardy) has other plans.  It's also during this movie that a certain character finally realizes his goal of what it is to be human, but in a way you'd never expect unless you've already seen the movie.<br />Special effects again were outstanding, and this movie also has it's share of action.  The action sequences were top notch, especially the fight scene between the Viceroy and Riker. I really enjoyed the way they gradually revealed the relationship between Picard and Shizon and how Picard desperately tries to convince Shizon to become a better person than what he is now.   There were some slow parts in the movie, but not enough to ruin it.   In fact, I found the relationship between Capt. Jean Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Shizon very interesting and compelling.  Yes, the idea of a captain having an evil double or clone has been explored before in the original Star Trek series, but never to this extent. <br />Extras --  This DVD has the most extras, compared to the last two.  There are three documentaries on the making of the film, deleted scenes,  a commentary by the director (Stuart Baird) and a Photo Gallery, putting it on par with therecent \\"Collector's Editions\\" Paramount has been releasing of the first 6 Star Trek films on DVD.  As with the other editions, it is  Widescreen and digitally enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br />I recommend this film to all Star Trek fans, but remember while you're reading this, that this is only my opinion, don't take it to heart.   In the final equation all that really matters is what YOU thought of the movie.  If you enjoyed it, that's all that`s important!
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana was a nice relief from all the crap they were spewing over the airwaves 14 years ago. With just the first few chords of Smells Like Teen Spirit, they started a musical revolution, de-throning the prince of pop, and forming a whole new subculture of flannel wearing grunge...people. (grungers? is that a word?) Out of this grunge era came some of the (in my opinion, anyways) greatest bands of all time. Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Sonic Youth, Pearl Jam etc. (and the not grunge at all, but equally good band, the Smashing Pumpkins.) And the reigning king of this grunge dynasty, the crowning glory of all grunge's achievements, was Kurt Cobain and his kick ass band Nirvana. <BR>Nirvana single handedly started the grunge movement with a song, and Kurt (God rest his soul) single handedly ended it with a bullet. While Nevermind might not be the groups' best work (In Utero gets the honour of being their best) it is still a great album. It is worth every cent you pay for it. It is one of those things that every body should own.<BR>Just as 14 years ago, the airwaves are once again polluted with crap. Fortunately, Nirvana's music is still here to save us from the overplayed crappy bands that dominate the radiowaves of today, just like they did back in '91. <BR>And now, especially now 10 years after Kurts death, it's nice to listen to them, and look back on the happier days, and remember grunge in all it's glory. Even if you are too young to remember grunge, you can still feel it. The power, the angst, the...well, grunge...that drove a generation. <BR>Grunge is forever.<BR>Grunge is not dead. <BR>May your soul forever rest in peace Kurt.

The crew of the Enterprise-E must go back in time to prevent The Borg from altering Earth's history to suit their purposes.  The Borg try to change the timeline of history by trying to prevent the inventor of the Warp Drive, Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell), from flying his warp-capable spaceship.  By the way, the Zefram Cochrane in this movie is totally different from the character portrayed by Glenn Corbett in the \\"Metamorphosis\\" episode of  the original Star Trek.<br />The Special Effects in this movie were outstanding.  The action sequences I felt were superbly done, especially the fight between the Borg Queen and Picard. There was great acting by all involved, including Patrick Stewart, James Cromwell, and Alfrie Woodard. Alice Krige was exceptional as the Borg Queen.. <br />The picture quality in this DVD was excellent. Sound quality was also very good.<BR> <BR>Extras --  Teaser trailer and Theatrical trailer are included, but nothing else. However, despite this, I  highly recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans.  Those wanting more should wait for the \\"Collector's Edition\\", whenever it comes out!<br />To everyone who reads this, keep in mind that this is only my opinion, don't take it to heart.   In the final equation all that really matters is what YOU thought of the movie.  If you enjoyed it, that's all that's important!
B00013F38K|4.0|I was very excited to hear that &quot;Kung Fu&quot; was going to be released on DVD, as this was one of my favorite shows back in the 70's (and in re-runs in the 80's.) It is a real pleasure to be able to watch these episodes in order, with spectacular color and sound. I can't wait for the remaining seasons (and hopefully the inferior but still entertaining &quot;Kung Fu - The Legend Continues&quot;) to come out!<br />So why only a 4? Several reasons: (1) I hate double-sided DVD's. Warner seems especially prone to this cost-cutting tactic. Really, just an annoyance. (2) The widescreen cropping - until I read about it I didn't really notice the &quot;missing&quot; picture, though now that I'm looking for it, it's a little bit more noticeable. Again, this is just an annoyance for me. (3) the occasional pops and scratches - I would have thought they could be eliminated during the re-mastering. You guessed it, no more than an annoyance.<br />Yes, there are many aspects of this show that are dated (it is from the 70's after all! Amazingly, this show stands the test of time far better than many other series from that time period, possibly because of its setting and message.) Yes, there is blatant racism and stereotyping in some of the casting (yet the show also addresses racism in many episodes.) Yes, the martial arts are mediocre at best until Kam Yuen is brought in as kung fu advisor. Yes, Bruce Lee was passed over in favor of a Caucasian (and the show would have been radically different had he not been, and not necessarily in a positive way.) All of these points are true, but this is still one of the first shows that used martial arts in a positive light (non-revenge oriented) and which along with Bruce Lee helped bring martial arts into mainstream American culture.<br />If you enjoyed this show as much as I did, and aren't horribly offended (as some are) by the cropping - buy this set. You won't be disappointed.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|I have always read reviews on this website for a long long time...am a 'metalhead', if i can still use that term...have over 500 CD's, have been into guitar chords for more than 12 years and never have i felt the urge to write a review as i do for this, simply because of the lack of reviews for it...just so that more people go out and buy this album and support this great band and the talents of a future legend: 26 year oldTobias Sammett...<BR>The 'King of Fools' EP was the appetizer for the real thing and the first chords off 'mysteria' proves it and gets u hungry for an hour long metal ecstasy and the end leaves u begging for more...following every rule and then breaking a few, the CD redefines power metal with elements of thrash and speed and yes Tobi is this and the next generations Bruce, Halford or Tate, whoever suits u'r taste, its amazing to see the maturity this band has reached in the last few years and they are still wuite young...i could rate each song but it would all be the same , a perfect 10...this is something special people buy this and everything Edguy...and btw, UP THE IRONS !!!! :)
B000005IU1|5.0|This was the stuff we tripped to.  Absolutely the best jams.  If you were there in 69, you know.  If you weren't there, you missed it and this album will give you a chance to get the flavor.  1969 was the peak and Iggy was at the extreme end of it.  I have bought this album three times over the last 35 years.  I love every song.  No Fun... Asheton is at his garage best.  1969... Oh my and a ooh hoo!  We Will Fall... Trip music extraordinaire.  I Just Wanna Be Your Dog... The bells just keep ringing.  And all the others... each with its own magic.  Wow do I love this album!!  I'll have them playing these songs at my funeral.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Oh my gosh this is awesome.  If you like the Who, you will love them after watching this and if you already love the Who then you will be on cloud nine!  They are THE BEST!!!!!!  Awesome restoration!  GET IT!!!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums released all throughout the 90's. 10-20 years from now people will look back and talk about Tool as people currently talk about Pink Floyd. <br />Every single song (I'm not counting fillers) on this album is truly one of my all-time favorites.<br />If you consider yourself a fan of good music, then this is a must have.
0790729652|5.0|What an awesome film!  Tim Burton is a film genius.  He immerses you into this world of crime and mystery.  The caricatures are wonderful.  One of Warner Bros. best!  I believe of the four films that were made this one is the best one.  Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, along with Kim Basinger, highlight the awesome cast.  Jack plays the joker perfectly, and Michael brings a dark mystique to Batman.  If you are a fan of the popular comic see this film.  If you prefer the TV series this film may not be so appealing.  The sets are mavelous as well as the effects.  It deserved every penny it made.
0062502182|4.0|This book shows a great way to achieve your life-long goals.  It makes you see things in a totally new light.  It talks of your Personal Legend, and the Soul of the World, but after finishing the book, it all makes sense.  The Alchemist explains how a boy followed his heart and conquered many problems in order to realize his dream.  This book explains that it is important to be true to yourself, and if you do so, good things will come your way.  It does revolve a lot around omens and superstitions, but it is really a good novel.  I definitely recommend The Alchemist to everyone.  It will surely make you feel good about yourself once you read it.
1572814349|5.0|\\"Golden Tarot is a compilatioin of collages from artwork of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. Poignant images of gentle beauty and human frailty came from a time of violence, pestilence, and oppression. These images speak to me of a truth that is timeless, and hope that flowers even in the darkest conditions. It is my hope that they speak to you as well.\\" -- Kat Black, creator of The Golden Tarot.<br /><br />I have never been drawn to traditional Tarot decks, especially those fashioned after the Rider-Waite. Rather, I tend to go for the funky, the symbolic, and the high tech. One of the reasons for my preference is because modern life seems so far removed from the period in which traditional Tarot was created.<br /><br />So I wasn't sure what to expect from Kat Black's Golden Tarot. I knew nothing about the deck, other than people were giving it high praise. When I opened the sturdy box with the lid that comes off the top, I was intrigued that therein was a deck with gilded edges. Remmeber your Grandmother's Bible? The one who's pages shined so brightly when closed? This luxurious deck has that same gilt edging. The cards follows traditional Tarot, with 78 cards total. The Minor Arcana is fully illlustrated like the Majors. The images are printed on heavy cardboard with a matte golden border. The back is a tapestry of subdued shades of camel and rust. You can't tell from the backs if a card is upright or reversed.<br /><br />The most unsual aspect of Golden Tarot is that deck creator Kat Black has digitally collaged images from various lesser-known paintings from a period she calls International Gothic. This period of time, 1200-1500 A.D., evolved into the Reniassance. She deliberately avoided using art by well-known artists such as da Vinci and Michelangelo, and most of the paintings used for the deck are hanging in European churches. (A sight that most of us will never see!)<br /><br />The collaged images are so seamless, that I didn't know I was looking at a digitally collaged deck until I read the 200 page bound booklet included in the package. I even showed my artist husband, and he had no idea, either! The images on the cards are truly breathtaking. I feel like I'm looking at a masterpiece with each and every one. I'm sure that Ms. Black intends this deck to actually be read not just admired as an art deck, but they're so gorgeous I'm reluctant to read with them! (So don't expect information on how they read...I'm too busy drooling over the images!)<br /><br />The high-quality booklet not only contains the standard meanings for the images (upright and reversed), but also Appendices that list every part that was digitally collaged and the painting that it came from. The Hermit is one of the cards that I look at first when checking out a new deck, and its rendering in this deck resonated deeply with me: it's a picture of a gray-bearded St. Francis of Assisi standing in a darkened forest. A deer is at his side, he's holding a latern that gives off little light, and a gray cat is chasing a quail. The man's body and deer, the latern, the forest, the head, quail, and cat all come from different sources. As I mentioned, you cannot tell that this picture is collaged! An amazing technological feat indeed.<br /><br />Kat Black mentions that this version of the Golden Tarot took 1,500 hours to produce. This deck was originally web-only, but fans of her work urged her to create an actual deck. Tarot enthusiasts and deck collectors alike will be much richer for having Black's breath-taking creation in hand.<br /><br />(To see 10 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)til I read the 200 page bound booklet included in the package.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is a very talented young lady.  This album is sure to be a pop classic.
B00006RU5B|1.0|How can anyone like this? Its not catchy, it doesn't sound good, and the lead singer &quot;sings&quot; so friggin annoying.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This was the worse out of all the Matrix movies. I say this because it was like a rip off of the Star Wars series starting with  chapter 4 \\"A New Hope\\". Same story lines,same hero super powers (holding the hand out and controlling objects) and same dull effects. A lot of blue screen (or chromo effects) in this and they where done very slopply. The bullet time effects was (thank god) at a min. The story line continued to drag along leaving the action to die down. Why was this needed to in 3 different movies? This movie could have been wrapped up in maybe one and the most 2 movies. After a while the action got perdictable.     Just a string of hollywood greed and a huge waste of time. Save your money rent it first or watch Star Wars instead !!!!

0060512806|4.0|Let me preference this book by stating that I am a WWII history buff that rarely reads historical fiction. My friend gave me this book after I expressed some interest about WWII codebreaking techniques and I couldn't put this book down.  As an Engineer, it kept me interested from a technical point of view but overall was very entertaining as well.  The book has a great plot tying together several main characters ranging from a WWII Marine to a WWII codebreaker to a present day computer programmer.  This book also taught me a lot about the history of computers as well as teaching me a few Unix commands.  This book is so well written and has so many interesting thoughts and good information that I felt like using a highlighter while I read.  The only reason I give this book 4 rather than 5 stars is that to me the ending came a little to fast.  The ending worked but to me felt like the author ran out of steam or had to get the ending in before a deadline as the final events aren't quite as deeply discussed as the rest of the text.  Regardless, this is a great book to read.
0452285186|1.0|On average I read a new book every day. A 500 page book may take me two evenings but it's rare that I can't finish a novel before bed. I guess I'm trying to say I'm not the kind of person who usually quibbles over spending $8 buck on a paperback. I read the reviews here and since I was passing a bookstore that night I dropped in to buy it. Some of the Comics are extremely funny. I mean laugh out laugh so everyone in the bookstore hears you and turns their head funny! But most of the cartoons are barely mediocre. The 5 or 6 superb ones almost made me buy it. I'm pretty honest that way. I've read more than a few novels cover to cover while browsing in a bookstore aisle and even though I've already read them I always buy them any way. I don't believe in not paying for something I've read. I guess the point is that I read this book in 9 minutes and found myself walking back from the counter to the book shelf (3 times) struggling with my conscience about whether I was going to purchase it. Ultimately I felt that the book was such a waste of money that I ended up not buying it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this show. From the pilot to the last episode, it is strong all the way through. It episode got noticeably better as it went on. Just when you thought that there was no way from them to top the previous episode, they did. The Character's are some of the best I seen. They are so interesting in their interactions. The dialog is top notch and extremely witty. Some episodes are non stop one liners that will have you rolling on the floor while other episodes can be quite chilling or dramatic. This show has it all and I truly think it something that can be enjoyed by everyone. It doesn't suffer from the same sci-fi stereo-types, in fact it goes against them somewhat. I can almost guarantee that you will like this show. Like I said, it has a lot of appeal for a wide group of people. Give it a shot, you WILL NOT be disappointed.<br />Just go buy it, It's only 35$ and it's worth it!
B000000JO3|5.0|This has got to be my first or second favorite CD ever (the only other one I've heard that comes close is Operation Ivy). I love everything about this album- the sound, the lyrics; except that it's a reminder that we'll never hear any new Minor Threat. If you're thinking about buying this album: stop thinking about it and just do it. You will be happy you did.
0698119347|5.0|Stormbreaker is an exciting, fast paced book, Anthony Horowitz adds so much description he can make even the most unbelievable storyline seem to be amazingly realistic.  You have to read this book.<BR> (...)
B0000DD7LC|1.0|I fell asleep listening to this album.  This album is better suited for a funeral home.  YUCK.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie just proves if that you have enough marketing money...the hype will build.<BR>This movie is all dressed up with no place to go.....<BR>I saw it in the theatre and I should have asked for my money back.   <BR>The script stunk.  The characters are bored while in exciting Tokyo so they sit in bars and smoke and share shallow dialogue.  Gee hold me back!  This is one big yawn...<BR>This flick makes my top ten list of worst movies I have ever seen.
B00006SFLV|5.0|i love, love, love &quot;my so-called life.&quot; the show was artistically done (like the opening scenes of &quot;dancing in the dark&quot; where angela is discribing her &quot;3, no 4, no 3&quot; kisses), and the relationships between all the characters are interesting and ever-changing. the show is full of relevant quotes/insights that apply completely to high school life and even life in general and funny &amp; touching moments. the fact that the show ends on a cliff-hanger note, never to be finalized, makes the show even more poetic. i have been watching VHS taped versions of the show for a few years, and my tapes are shot. i'm so glad that these dvds came out so that i can now watch the shows clearly. some people have complained about the sound, but i don't see any problems at all. i just wish there were special features. if you love this show, buy the dvds, and if you've never seen the show, watch it!
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|Alright. I've had enough of the complaining about how the acting was wooden, the characters didn't have any fun, the action was the whole movie, the special effects were bad, and on and on....<br />The movie was exactly what I expected: a dark struggle between two ancient forces who anticipate an apex in the hostilities very soon. Yeah, not a lot of joking around happening here and although a few of the actors explore the craft of acting from A to B (instead of A to Z). (...)She was certainly as entertaining if not more so than Tank Girl or Stripperella! And Kate Beckinsale in her latex catsuit is at least as appealing as Wonder Woman is, right?<br />I liked the movie, bought the movie, have watched the movie several more times since the purchase and eagerly await the sequel, so there!
0375703764|4.0|At many points in the book, HOUSE OF LEAVES is a page turner in the extreme, with actual book turning in a counter clockwise fashion.  Text is omitted, footnoted into absurdity, set into designs (which work to surprising effect), etc.<br />Without giving too much away, THE HOUSE OF LEAVES is about a man that finds and edits a manuscript by a dead blind man.  The manuscript is an analysis of a fictious movie about a house that is bigger on the inside than the outside.  Interested?  You'd be surprised how facinating that premise becomes.  This is really two novels, that of the editor, and that of the family the movie is about.  When I say two novels, I mean that literally, too.  Not two stories, but two distinct novels juxaposed together.<br />Much of the beginning of the book is boring.  Many passages read like a textbook, which follows the schtick.  It is in the middle and end of the book that Danielewski finds his voice.  Once the plot takes off, you want to finish it, and many of the weirder elements of the book add to the aura of confusion.
B000002HMH|3.0|Though 'Load' is clearly not Metallica's finest hour, or artwork, I found it to be a somewhat decent album. As many of the other reviews have stated, 'Bleeding Me' is one of my favorites on the album, along side with 'Wasting My Hate' and 'The House That Jack Built'. Some good tracks and something different, three stars (two and a half, rounded up).<br />But I would still much rather listen to 'Ride The Lightning' than this.
1591391105|5.0|I bought this book in anticpation of a move that never happened. That said, it was remarkably useful even in my current position. It helped me frame many of my career experiences in a larger context, and when I do make a move in the future, I will be prepared for it.<br />I even bought it for a friend as a &quot;happy new job&quot; gift. She loved it, too.
1878424319|5.0|This book occupies a very distinct place of honor on my shelf of great reads. To inspire and teach the true foundations of the human existance, and to become the fullness of our own true potential, we need various &quot;road guides&quot; to navigate the tough turns and turn on our headlights! Also on my shelf - &quot;Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect&quot; by Tiffany Snow; &quot;The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment&quot; by Eckhart Tolle; and &quot;7 Habits Of Highly Effective People&quot; <BR>by Stephen Covey. Keep driving, and enjoy the view!
074325144X|5.0|For years I was running incorrectly because I have a tight Achilles tendon in my right leg. After only a few minutes of running, my leg would hurt so badly that I could hardly walk on it. After reading this book, I can now proudly say that I am running correctly every day without any pain at all. Also, I am thoroughly enjoying running now for the first time ever. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone... those who are afraid to run because they think they might get hurt, those who feel that they are too lazy or out of shape to start running now, and anyone else who just wants to try something new, you won't be sorry because it does not get any better than ChiRunning!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|There have been many comparisons of soundtrack of 'The Passion of the Christ' (TPOTC) with Peter Gabriel's score for 'The Last Temptation of Christ' (TLTC), as if similarities or the apparent fact that John Debney was heavily influenced by, or even borrowed from, Gabriel's score, somehow invalidates the artistic appropriateness and subsequent achievement of this score.    This is irrelevant.  EVERYONE copies.   The greatest masters of their craft always copy when appropriate.  James Horner's score to 'Glory'--the score that won him wide recognition, is largely based on archival battle scores.  SO?    IT WORKS.  PERFECTLY.  For John Debney, James Horner, and everyone who ever achieved any significance in any art or science, to NOT borrow would be negligent.   What works, works.  Without the past, art and science could not exist.  Period.    Moving on (hopefully)... If Gabriel used (not invented) primitive artforms to capture the essence of Middle-Eastern demonism in TLTC, Debney builds on it and brings it full circle by dropping it in the context of lush orchestration.  Few scores can embody inner turmoil as intense as the Messiah's Passion and at the same time compliment inter-human dramatic themes and the intense, supernatural demonic and Divine story components.    Quite a feat.  It's like Hans Zimmer and Howard Shore got together and composed a perfect unity.    I predict:  The Best Soundtrack of 2004.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|No need here to go into a synopsis--others have already done it. I loved this movie....was afraid it would not live up to its hype, but it did. It was funny and sad and touched me on many levels.<br />Keaton and Nicholson were brilliant together and the supporting cast was pretty perfect too, although a bit underused. And the scenery...what could be more gorgeous than that beach?<br />Keaton really shone in this movie and I thought her character was extremely well-developed. I will NEVER forget the scene where she is sitting at her computer, at her desk, typing and wailing and crying. I re-watched that scene  three times! Perfection!<br />Loved the ending too.
B00009RAJI|5.0|&quot;Rumours&quot; has become such a familiar work of popular music that one almost doesn't hear it when listening to it.  This remastered edition, while not exactly perfect, is a reminder of just how fresh and alive Fleetwood Mac was in 1977.  Definitely at the top of their game, they created THE masterpiece of 70's pop-rock and one of the most cohesive collections of songs ever.  There's no need to review the music itself here, so lets take a look at the improvements and additions.  To begin with, the sound quality of the remastering is simply exquisite.  You hear all of the acoustics, voice and band, in vibrant detail and the lushness in sound has never been better represented.  Also, the once lost classic &quot;Silver Springs&quot; is finally and properly included on &quot;Rumours&quot;, with a couple of reservations.  First of all, it isn't the original version.  It's another remix that pushes Stevie's vocal so far up front that it buries the burnished harmonies that made the original so stunning.  In addition, it's shoved into the middle of the CD as if it's always been there.  It would have been better to add it as a bonus track at the end and have the original work presented as it was intended.  Still, these are minor quibbles.  The second CD of demos and outtakes differs only marginally from the final versions, but it's still interesting, especially the two versions of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and the four songs that didn't make the final selection (none were worthy and their deletion shows that the Mac really were the best judges of their own music).  The rougher version of &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; is actually a looser, blusier version that improves on the more polished hit single, and it's nice to hear some of the unused harmonies of Christine and Stevie on that song and the &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; outtake.  All in all, this is a pristine edition of an album for the ages.  Never break the chain.
B0001CCXGG|4.0|Well, I loved the first G3 release with Eric Johnson, witch made me get the bootlegs on the internet with Steve Morse, Bryan May, John Petrucci and others. OK, well, now about this G3: while we have one side of the coin, where Joe Satriani (applause!), my favorite virtuous guitar player did excellent performances, as usual and Steve Vai (applause!) seemed like Einstein (or Zappa, witch is the same) on the guitar, the other side... er... we have... ta-rararaaamm... the ultraspeed virtuous neoclassical bla-bla-bla... Yngwie Malmsteeeeen!! (no applause!) ;p Well, people, I'm kinda joking, but that's the truth. While Satriani and Vai are Buggs Bunny, witch means funny, brilliant and most favorite, Malmsteen are Daffy Duck, witch means, ridiculous, non-sensitive, out-of-place, and boring! What's that version of Red House?? Where's the feeling?? Jimi Hendrix should want to go out of his tomb and smash Malmsteen in the face for that crime with his song! Not counting his ridiculous attitudes, spitting out all that speed crap with no feeling over and over again, and having all that pathetic euphoria, like he wants to prove that he's the man. Big deal!! Sorry, Mr. &quot;ultrasonic guitar&quot;, you're not Blackmore or even Hendrix, and will never be. And why the heck he had a bigger setlist than the others? Can't see the point! With a good material they've recorded with Petrucci last tour, they could turn this into the next G3 CD and DVD. I'm so glad that we still have the brilliantism of Vai and Satriani to clean the path and makes it worth, only them, makes this release to earn 4 stars. And I'm still looking for the next G3 tour with a true guitar genious, Robert Fripp. Sorry, guys, this tour with Malmsteen was really embarrassing, just look the video samples on the internet to see the ridiculous Malmsteen's &quot;attack&quot;. I really hope for the next G3 CD and DVD to be better than this one.
0385474547|5.0|In Things Fall Apart, Achebe writes a masterpiece that depicts pre-Colonial Africa not as a romanticized place, but rather as a strongly traditional land with certain violent customs.  He then proceeds to introduce the beginning of colonialism, which disrupts the fine balance that had been achieved previously.  Such story is told through the life of Okonkwo.<br />Okonkwo is depicted as a violent man with a strong temper.  However, the readers can help sympathizing with him as we follow his life's story and his deep fear of failure, which he gained from seeing his father fail his entire life.  Okonkwo became a strong leader in his tribe Umuofia (in Ibo, Nigeria).  His fear of failure and weakness extend to his son, who he considers similar to his father.  He begins his undoing when, afraid to seem weak, he is forced to slaughter a boy that lived in his house, Ikemefuna.  He then proceeds, through bad luck, to be banned from the tribe.  As he is returning 7 years later and looking forward to his old life, colonial life appears.<br />The changes that occur between old and new, especially those related to religion, lead to his downfall.  Through his downfall, Achebe represents the downfall of an entire society.  It is a deeply moving work, one that will leave you wanting to read more of Achebe's books.  I recommend following the series with No Longer at Ease next, it is very interesting as well.
B000053V7O|1.0|This is a rip off of the Bud Powell story, plain and simple.  Francis Paudras was an artist of sorts, similar to the graphic artist in the movie.  Francis lived with his girlfriend rather than his daughter.  Buttercup was the devil woman in Powell's life, they don't even bother to change the name here.  Making money off of the story of Bud Powell without having to pay anyone for it seems ridiculous to me.  If you want the real story behind this movie, read &quot;Dance of the Infidels: A Portrait of Bud Powell&quot;, written by Paudras himself.  The book, while tedious at times, is drenched with the emotion of a truly heartbreaking story, rather than this cheap ripoff.
B00006SFLV|4.0|My high rating may be biased since I loved the show when it was originally on the air but I love the DVD collection even more. The lack of special features bothers me a little bit but the shows are still great on their own. The abrupt end to the series leaves you wanting more but the season finale fits nevertheless. If you were a fan of Dawson's but thought they were too happy all of time or were ever addicted to Daria, My So Called life is for you.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|Lackluster album.  Week vocals do not suit these neo soul beats.<BR>This is a weak album.
1559277254|4.0|The answer to the question is &quot;yes&quot;, because that is how I felt with this book.  In it Stephanie has two more vehicles that get blown up plus Ranger's.  It gets a little stale after awhile.  This is still a pretty good book though because we see our old favourites - Lula, Gramma Mazur and of course Ranger and Morelli.  Some unfinished business between Stephanie and Ranger gets finished too.  I wish they could bottle and sell Ranger!  Anyway, in this book Stephanie is trying to find a missing mother and her daughter for a friend of her family, and she is thrown against a really bad dude who begins terrorizing her and her family.  Ranger really helps Steph a lot in this one because this guy is really scary!  In fact, it makes Stephanie really consider a new line of work.
B0000019PA|5.0|Jeff Magnum is an excellent songwriter. He has a powerful voice, a very strong and confident style of acoustic guitar playing. As a guitar player this album has been very inspirational to me so just go ahead and do yourself a favor by buying this album.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|Honey is an underrated, enjoyable little film about a wannabe dancer trying to make it big. It's considered by some to be the Flashdance of our generation, but I feel this film succeeds on many levels which Flashdance couldn't, taking the viewer deep into the heart, soul, and trials and tribulations of the heroine. I'd compare it more to Fame. Others compared it to the horrendous Mariah Carey bomb, Glitter, even though this film is far superior and executed quite nicely. All in all, the plot has been done countless times before and is chock full of cliche after cliche after cliche, but Jessica Alba's bright presence, great dance numbers, fun cameos, and (gasp!) some pretty good dialogue, make this way above average for the genre. I recommend Honey instead of the movies it ripped off because while those movies might entertain, at least Honey has heart. It's a fabulously fun time.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Should be every sales organizations beginning presentation to break in new salesmen! You have got to watch this DVD. Not only is it filled with &quot;the don't give up attitude&quot;! but it is hilariously entertaining. If you haven't seen it - GET IT!
1573228737|2.0|I picked this up at my local library after reading heaps of praise for Sarah Waters and her three books: Tipping the Velvet, Affinity, and Fingersmith.  I just wanted a good, well-written, engrossing novel featuring juicy lesbian interaction and a perhaps enlightening Victorian slice of life.  Seems reasonable, right?  Wrong. <br />I consider myself a fairly literate person but I could barely get through Affinity.  Picking up this book became a chore- not that it's written with difficult or esoteric verbage...it's just simple-minded, clumsy, and BORING.  Sarah Waters employs the device of storytelling via diary entries...current ones from the heroine, Margaret, and ones from a few years back from her would-be lover, Selina...Having to constantly flashback several years becomes maddening as Margaret's entries are far more interesting and contains much more \\"voice\\" than the drab Selina's.  <br />As for the book's lesbian content...  Not hot, sorry.  For instance, Waters (through Margaret) continually describes Selina- the supposed [symbol of sex] and object of desire- as waifish, homely, greasy-haired, and with cracked lips and red hands...Who the heck knows why Margaret or anyone else would find this woman attractive or potential romance with her enticing.  Margaret's physical appearance is never described and since she is your typical \\"plucky\\" outspoken type (her public behavior, by the way, is completely out of time in Victorian England, I might add) I had no sense of her being attractive or interesting.  There is no heat to this book.  It is chilly and cold as the jail cells in which it takes place.  I'd also like to add that the \\"twist\\" at the end is laughably bad.
0451450523|1.0|The book got off to a rocky start. It became better during the part where the Unicorn meets the wizard. Then, almost a chapter later turned on a downhill course. I stayed up reading it until midnight hoping it would turn out better, but I was thoroughly put out with the end. Sure the wizard has a happy ending, but the Unicorn is forced to go around the world for eternity, knowing she is different from the rest of her kind. I found it a waste of time and wonder why many think that it is &quot;'Extraudinary'&quot; Unfortunately, 1 star is the lowest rating on here.
B000002KK2|4.0|My mother bought me this cd for my 21st birthday (thank you mom).  At first I wasn't too sure.  I've always been a blues fan with tendencies toward harder rock kind of stuff--so, when I heard Rickie for the first time I didn't know what to make of any of it.  Her voice is so mellow and cool.  This cd just winds everything down, especially tracks like &quot;Last Chance Texaco&quot; and &quot;Coolsville&quot;.  I also like the lighter tracks like &quot;Danny's all star joint&quot; and &quot;Easy Money&quot;.  &quot;Weasel's&quot; pretty good too, and &quot;Night Train&quot;--it's all good.  All in all, this is quite different from what I'm used to and much more than I expected.  Though I didn't get it the first time, I kept listening.  It'll grow on you.  She's classy, soulful, mellow, poetic and unlike anything I've ever heard (but then again, I'm just some punk kid from Texas).  Don't just take my word for it--this is quite an experience.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee has an amazing voice that can sound sorta creepy at times, but I have never heard anyone sing so well in my entire life(including famous people). What's good about it is that the songs don't point to just one issue, they let you think about what they are saying so that you can interpret it towards your life. The only thing I hate about this album is that it should just be called the Amy Lee show. Evanescence is said to be made up up of just Amy Lee and Ben Moody(he probably left 'cause most people think Evanescence is made of just Amy Lee.)- but what about the people who play th drums and the other instuments? I mean, really, it's not just about Amy Lee.
B000003TAB|5.0|Ten years gone, and Nirvana's music is still running wild. This record goes more alternitave than their other albums. This cd even punkers will love. If you like &quot;Green Day&quot;, you will definitley love this cd. Before I bought this cd I though &quot;Nevermind&quot; was the best album in the world(which you should buy in addition to this)but after just heiring this album I simply thought, this is the greatest Nirvana record I have ever heard. It is the best really. Well actually a tie between this and &quot;Nevermind&quot;, becuase &quot;Nevermind&quot; is an incredible record. <br />Insesticide also really defines grunge. And most of the songs on this record is from the &quot;Vaselines&quot;. They wrote all of my favorite songs. They wrote &quot;Mollys Lips&quot; and &quot;Son of a gun&quot;, which are amazing songs. This record could really get you into the Vaselines. They are an amazing band. <br />This is definitley a must, if your a Nirvana fan or not, if you like bands like &quot;Green Day&quot; and &quot;blink 182&quot;, you'll love this cd. Ten years without kurt, we need you dude. <br />                                          R.I.P
B000060P79|4.0|This c.d. is really good just some of the words aren't poetic.But, anyway,this is a good c.d. and all of you avril haters will love it. My personal favorites are:    1.I'd do anything    2.I'm just a kid    3.addicted    4.perfect.    If you like the following bands you would probably like Simple Plan:    1.Good Charlotte(good charlotte is a little more hardcore though)    2.Blink-182 (a little more parental advisory if you know what I mean)    3.Sum-41 (More hardcore)
B0000DD7LC|1.0|I tried to like Alicia Keys but her vocals talent is garbage.  It just doesn't sound right for this girl to do these types of songs.  Alicia Keys, Macy Grey type voice just ruins these songs.<BR>I don't know maybe her should listen to classic soul Queens like Aretha Franklin, or even Mary J. Blige.
B0000029J5|5.0|There's something about acoustic blues, the idea of playing on a street corner deep in the Delta, running a bottle over a National Steel. Keb' Mo' is one of the best acoustic blues players today. Sometimes it's just him and his guitar, other times he's backed by drums and keyboards. Moore's playing is full and you rarely notice that there is no one else playing but him. His solo guitar work brings visions of Robert Johnson, and he pays tribute to the Master with two of his cuts. The rest of the tracks are penned by Moore with some collaboration from others. <br />Every tune on this album is good. Moore's playing adjusts between strumming, fingerpicking and slide. He also adds in banjo and harmonica, but his great asset is his voice. Smooth and sweat, it lacks the gravel sound we've become accustomed to for the blues, but his voice is perfect for solo guitar, almost as if it matches the sound of the guitar. \\"Victims of Comfort\\" is my favorite off the album with his strumming and voice interaction. The song is just him and his guitar, almost slow and sad sounding. \\"Angelina\\" throws in drums to keep the beat and Moore's fingers pluck the strings with an upbeat tempo. \\"Come On In My Kitchen\\" is the first of the Johnson covers, and he plays with a slide, and belts out some on the harmonica, with a little help from an organ and drums. Another great cut. More of the straight blues shuffle is heard on \\"Love Blues\\" again a solo guitar bit. <br />Each track is good on this album, and proves that Keb' Mo' is a name to be recognized with his unique sound of yesterday. Anyone who likes the original blues players like Johnson, will love this album, as will many people who don't love the blues. Moore's voice is soothing, and his playing has a relaxed feel to it. A pure joy to listen to.
B00006690F|5.0|its class. its by far the best eminem album he made the 2nd best is marshall matters lp,slim shady lp,infinte and then 8 mile sound track.on the 8 mile sound track the only good song is loose yourself.i am the greatist eminem fan ever.......50 cent is no good!
B000084T18|1.0|When I gave this album 3 stars at one time?!  After listening to AZ, then listening to this, a thought hit me in the head like a Mike Tyson punch, this album is as bad as it gets.<br />First off this guy bites off everything in his site!!  The album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to AZ's Doe or Die, just longer.  The only reason why he's famus is because he got shot 9 times, and he's a fool on stereroids.  He's all over the media, and is an annoyment on MTV and BET!<br />Anyway on the album, his lyrics are childish, and nursery rhymes, along with a lame horrible flow, with good beats, but putting him on the tracks made em sound bad.  He's a million miles away from being Pac, and Ja Rule has a good chance of beating him.<br />If you like pop rap, odds are you brought it, and after reading this review, you hate me.  But for those who like real hip hop, understand this is garbage, and is doesn't even to deserve to be called a rapper from queens(Nas, AZ, and, Mobb Deep hold true to the queensbridge name) it's not even worth 50 cents itself.  It doesnt' even deserve to be on the shelves!!<br />Interesting fact:This fool dissin Ja Rule, yet he's copying Ja's style!  I mean he has a fake gangsta image, and club songs, love songs, and he acually sings songs, imitating Ja Rule.  And also, he used Pacs rhymes on the Hail Mary remix from Tupac's songs Hail Mary, and against all odds, to diss Ja while using Tupac's rhymes for exploitation.  What a joke, a discrace, and a cancer to Hip-Hop.(Just like chingy, Juelz Santana(He has good beats, but his rhymes are completly senseless, Ludacris, G-Unit, J-kwon, Bow Wow, and u know who else)<br /><br />peace

0790731002|3.0|&quot;Batman Forever&quot; isn't a top-tier comic-to-screen flick.  What it is, however, is the best of the three subpar sequels of the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise so far.  It's nowhere near as dark or moody as the first two movies, primarily due to the director, Joel Schumacher.  It's a different type of film more akin to the cheesy TV series with Adam West.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a fairly serious movie, but the mood of the film, from costumes to Gotham City, is more lighthearted than the first two films.<br />Val Kilmer has been knocked often for playing &quot;Batman.&quot;  Honestly, I think he does a fine job.  Expectations weren't as high for Michael Keaton, and when he pulled off the &quot;Batman&quot; character with style, audiences were blown away.  Kilmer was merely considered too average.  Playing Bruce Wayne wasn't considered much of a stretch for him, but he more than sufficed.<br />The story runs along at a fairly decent pace.  We're given the origins of &quot;Robin,&quot; &quot;Riddler,&quot; and &quot;Two-Face.&quot;  Once again, &quot;Batman&quot; has to fight two baddies at once, which is my largest complaint with all of the &quot;Bat&quot; sequels.  Why do we need more than one villain in order to make a story interesting?  As far as I'm concerned, there was no need for the &quot;Two-Face&quot; character.  He was boring, out of place, and simply used to usher in the appearance of &quot;Robin.&quot;<br />The &quot;Riddler&quot; character was fun.  A little over-the-top, but not annoying, Jim Carrey did a good job.  I was actually worried about him going too far with the character.<br />The rest of the cast is boring.  The story is moderate, and the visuals are nice to look at, but that's all. Once again, effects have replaced the plot in order to drag in the largest demographic possible.<br />In closing, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; is eye candy.  It's cool to look at and fun to watch, but when all is said and done, you've witnessed a marketing tool to push toy and t-shirt sales.  It's the best of the worst, so lets hope that a new sequel comes soon that will do the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise justice.ing tool to push toy and t-shirt sales.

B000002L5I|4.0|I really liked the album, I understand all the critizm for sounding to much like SRV.  But it does have its strong points.<BR>The guitar is amazing, wonderful rock and blues.  I love Slow Ride, True Lies, and Blue On Black.  But, it has all been heard before.
0790730960|2.0|&quot;Batman Returns&quot; has plenty of atmosphere about it.  There's no denying that.  However, this sequel pales in comparison to its predecessor.  The scenery is dark and moody, but the character of the &quot;Penguin&quot; is just atrocious.  How did a rich, greedy, power-hungry villain in the comics become a mutated, flipper-handed freak?  Keaton does a fine job as the &quot;Dark Knight,&quot; but his performance isn't enough to save this divebomb.  Michelle Pfeiffer is good as the &quot;Catwoman,&quot; but her squabble with Max Shreck(Christopher Walken) was weightless in this movie.  Her story seems too rushed in order to cram &quot;Batman's&quot; struggles with her and &quot;Penguin&quot; in an acceptable movie time length.<br />The special effects are okay, but the heavily armed penguins are just silly looking.  &quot;Batman&quot; has a couple of new toys, but his &quot;Batboat,&quot; much like the &quot;Batwing&quot; in the first flick, makes a quick entrance and exit.<br />It's obvious that Tim Burton was given a lot more creative freedom on this project.  That's too bad, because he takes too many liberties with the characters involved on this project.  The whole film has this &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; feel in it.  I usually enjoy Burton's projects, but this one goes too far with its brooding yet goofy atmosphere.<br />In this movie we are introduced to the idea that all of &quot;Batman's&quot; villains have to team up in order to beat him.  This one has three:  &quot;Penguin,&quot; &quot;Catwoman,&quot; and &quot;Max Shreck.&quot;  Although &quot;Catwoman&quot; is only &quot;sort of&quot; a villain, the flick still has to spend time describing her origin.  Following sequels have &quot;Riddler&quot; and &quot;Two-Face&quot; teaming up and &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; and &quot;Mr. Freeze&quot;(and an underused &quot;Bane&quot;).  The result is a story crammed with the origins of all the villains, the introduction and explanation of allies(&quot;Robin&quot; and &quot;Batgirl&quot;)and a twisting, turning plot that falls into quick boredom.  Sure, all of these sequels may be visually satisfying, but the stories are clunkers.  Perhaps the next movie(if there ever is one) will return to the original idea of having one meanie take on &quot;Batman.&quot;  Give these villains credit, they can give &quot;Batman&quot; a time on their own.<br />In closing, this is an okay picture.  It is very atmospheric, but atmosphere and a nickel won't even buy you a cup of coffee anymore. &quot;Batman Forever&quot; is a slightly better movie.  The tone of the film leans more toward the silly antics of the old TV show, but the brighter colors and lighter humor are a welcome change from &quot;Batman Returns.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the original, but it is a decent vision of the &quot;Batman&quot; comics.  The action is better than in &quot;Batman Returns,&quot; and Val Kilmer does a fine job filling Michael Keaton's shoes.  He keeps the integrity of the character alive despite a lightweight story.  The &quot;Riddler&quot; is a good villain(though not &quot;Joker&quot;), but &quot;Two-Face&quot; just doesn't belong.  Don't even bother with &quot;Batman &amp; Robin.&quot;  It takes the cheese-factor to an all-time low.; and &quot;Batgirl&quot;)and a twisting, turning plot that falls into quick boredom.

074325144X|3.0|Questionable reviews:<BR>All are from CT. Katherine Dreyer is the authors wife and co-author.The two reviews from Stamford are phrased very similarly. The other CT reviewer mentioned the DVD which was released the same day as the review was written, so he/she had to get it from the author, watch it and practice it all in the same day. This does not all seem very &quot;chi&quot; to me.<BR>Good points:<BR>Very pleasant writing style, no-ego, peaceful approach to running and life. Good tips and exercises for technique.<BR>Points to improve:<BR>Contradictory information. The title says &quot;effortless... running&quot;, but then on page 55 he says, &quot;It doesn't mean there's NO effort, just no unnecessary effort&quot;. On page 16 he emphasizes using the psoas muscles (front of hip at the waist) to left up the feet, which actually lift up the thigh, but then later says to not pick up your knees (psoas work), and pick up the feet ( hamstring work). How do you not pick up the knees when ruuning? It's necessary to swing the lower leg through to the front. He borrows Lydiard's &quot;rope pulling you at the pelvis/sternum from a distance away&quot; without giving Lydiard credit. Some physiology would help instead of saying that metabolic wastes will fill your legs with cement. Cement? Is that what that is? No mention of lactate threshold, anaerobic efforts, or shorter distance races are made.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is beyond words. Even people who don't like Opeth can listen to this CD. Mikael Akerfeldt uses his angelic vocal style through this whole album. Although fans may think it is too soft it still has all the elements of there harder albums.<BR>Give it a try. 5 out of 5!
B00005A0N5|4.0|This is definitely a good album, if you're starting off on Nightwish I recommend this album, or Over the Hills and Far Away. <br />Track reviews:<br />Stargazers: Powerful opening, great showoff of Tarja's vocal range. 5/5<br />Gethsemane: Kind of an eh track for me, not bad though. 3/5<br />Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean: Kind of a heavier track, the &quot;devil&quot; voice is a bit excessively deep though. 4/5<br />Sacrament of Wilderness: Best track on the album, every member is playing at their best in this one. Definite 5/5<br />Passion and the Opera: Good overall, not great though. 4/5<br />Swanheart: Compared to Walking in the Air, this ballad is kind of sucky. 2/5<br />Moondance: Instrumental, and it'll make you want to riverdance. 4/5<br />The Riddler: Great track, hard to get into at first. Like a previous reviewer said, you can sing along to it easily. 5/5<br />The Pharaoh Sails to Orion:  Use of the excessively deep voice again, kind of a lame track I think. 2/5<br />Walking in the Air:  GREAT ballad.  One of NW's best. 5/5<br />Sleeping Sun(hidden track): Never really listened to it much, seems okay. 4/5<br />In all, a great album, pick it up.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you don't like this album check yourself into a State Hospital.  It's just different from their other stuff.  It's o.k. for bands to try new things.  They still have the classic DT sound.  Only DT could pull off something like this.  They just take us back to what METAL is supposed to be.  Screw Nu-Metal!!!  Nu-Metal isn't metal at all!!!  Step outside your box and appretiate it for what it is...better than anything out right now...Peace out.
B000002MTU|3.0|3.5 stars not 3.  If you want to hear Clapton play blues and be innovative listen to John Mayalls Bluesbreakers from 1965 with the Beano cover - sure it's old and Mayalls vocals suck - but THAT is the album that made Eric Clapton.  Not this one!  All through Blues Breakers, Cream, Blind Faith, and the Dominoes (and even evident on some of his live 70's blues) Clapton broke new ground.  He played with power, finesse, style, and had a guitar vocabulary that was seemingly endless.  Then something happened.  These days you hear the same tired riffs over and over.  He not innovative anymore.  Oh he does some nice things on this disk but you start hearing patterns played in repetition.  Either his guitar vocabulary is decreasing or he's simply not pushing his limits anymore and probably doesn't care.  Play the Bluesbreakers disk then play this one. Play the Dominoes disk then play this one. This has intensity (like his Don't Think Twice from that live Dylan show) but it is a regurgitation of his modern day licks for the most part.  Fascinating listening - but my &quot;Thrill is Gone&quot; concerning Clapton.  Check it out.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX was the night of the crippler.He defeated Triple H and Shawn Micheals in one of the most brutal Triple Treat matches ever.Well here are my reviews for Wrestlemania XX<BR>within a scale of 1/10:<br />1)John Cena VS The Big Show 8/10<BR>John Cena fu'd the Big show after a shot with those new custom Knucks.John Cena defineatly deserved the gold.<br />2)RVD and Boooker T VS Garrison Kade and Mark Jindrak VS The Dudley Boys VS La Ressitance 7/10<BR>This match was quite good with RVD and Booker T retaining the titles after a scissors kick and a five star frogsplash on Rob Conway.<br />3)Chris Jericho VS Christian 10/10<BR>This match was much better than I thought it would be Christian winning with a roll up on Chris Jericho. The end was suprising when Trish slapped Jericho.<br />4)Rock n' Sock connection VS Evolution 10/10<BR>This match was very entertaining.The Rock and Flair looked as if they were having a great time.Evolution winning the match when Foley went to put Socko in Randy Orton's mouth but Randy hit the RKO before Socko came even close.<br />5)Torri Willson and Sable VS Miss Jackie and Stacy Kiebler 5/10<BR>This match was quite short and nothing close to a evening gown <BR>match,really.Torri with a roll up on Miss Jackie.<br />6)Crusierweight Open 8/10<BR>This match was also quite short but good really high flying. Rey mysterio made it to the finals but Rey Mysterio got cheat again by Chavo Senior when he held Chavo's hand in the Roll up<BR>helping Chavo get  the win.<br />7)Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar 6/10<BR>Well this match was quite boring for both these wrestlers level <BR>first they were staring at each other then they finnaly lock up testing each others strength.The end was what made this match good after Lesnar got jackhammered he got a stunner from Austin.<BR>Goldberg also got stunned after a beer.<br />8)Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty VS The Basham Brothers VS The APA VS The Self Proclaimed Worlds Greatest Tag Team 7/10<BR>Like the RAW Tag Team match the match was good.

Eddie un tieing his shoes which made Kurt Angle's Ankle Lock sliped and Eddie quickly got in to the rollup.<br />11)Undertaker VS Kane 10/10<BR>Well lets just say what a return. The Undertaker was not the only one who made a return so did Paul Bearer.The Undertaker dominated Kane right through the match. Kane countered Old School into a Chokeslam but the Undertaker just sat up.Undertaker won with a huge Tombstone Piledriver.At the end of the match Undertaker celebrated his record of 13-0 at Wrestlemania.<br />12) Triple H VS Shawn Micheals VS Chris Beniot 10/10<BR>This was one helluva match with Triple H and Shawn Micheals<BR>some amazing. Triple H and Shawn Micheals did some teamwork to <BR>like sending Beniot in to a table which knocked him out for about five minutes.Chris Beniot got the Crippler Crossface on Triple H which made Triple H tap.At the end of the night both champions stood side by side holding their titles up high.<br />The Extras according to Silvervision are: Bonus interviews, Heat matches,Hall of Fame footage/interviews,The Mania of Wrestlemania,The top 10 matches of Wrestlemania, Wretlemania History (photo gallery, factoids, official results) and Wrestlemania Trivia.<br />This PPV was superb in my view and I am defineatly Buying it. I reccomend this DVD.
B00004THAY|3.0|Eric and BB, well more Eric and less BB.  Much more Eric.  In fact the title depicts that this is from Claptons point of view. Kind of odd that Clapton is driving the car - I don't quite understand the significance of that in regards to the title.  They could have had a chauffeur in the front and had BB and Clapton both in the back seat or maybe even BB could have drove to show that Clapton is the guy doing the following.  I don't know.  It's pretty good.  I bought it, I occasionally listen to it.  A couple songs could have been left off, a couple more could have been added.  But its like Phil Collins says about Clapton - this guy wears $2000 Versace suits and is a multi millionaire - how can his Blues really be from the heart?  Clapton was best in the Blues Breakers where he really crafted his art and he's been riding that reputation since 1965.  Buy this album and hear a tired rich guitarist try to sound authentic - and hear the genuine article (BB) get overshadowed.
0743454529|5.0|this book was an easy fast paced read.
B000002G8J|2.0|I read a rolling stone review of this album back when it came out and it was the most hilarous thing I've ever seen!  Something about this album being a non-entity and that Clapton records the transference of a cigarette from one hand to another and its 10th rate Fleetwood mac and that the band sounds like a hawaiian karoake performance.  It's pretty lame - weak and his vocals go out of tune.  Tulsa time, Watch out for lucy, and promises are about all there is here - the rest of it can pretty much go away.  Golden ring is his attempt to create another wonderful tonight and it falls short.  Skip it.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Of all the opeth albums that I own and heard this one is probably my choice for the best one. All of them are outstanding in their complexity, but on damnation they decided to change the pace to mostly an acoustic album with no gutteral vocals and barely any distorted guitar. But what good about this album is that it is the most intelligent of all of their albums and it seems that all of the elements are put exactly where they were supposed to be. No misproportions. very balanced and the songs are PERFECT! this creation is incredible!
0452285186|5.0|This book caught the eye of one of my coworkers while he was waiting in line at the Starbucks/Barnes &amp; Noble. His humour is slightly...off...so he had to buy it. Not much work got done after the book was brought into the office.  This book is twisted and kind of sad, but VERY funny.
0385504209|1.0|The Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, and many masons have kept alive among their secret beliefs that the Merovingian line of Frankish kings from the early Middle Ages were descended directly from Jesus. To justify this outlandish claim, they must profess that Jesus did not die on the cross but survived it, and went on to live a much longer life, married Mary Magdalene and had children with her, from whom the Merovingians supposedly descend. There isn't any historic evidence for this. (The Merovingians were replaced on the Frankish throne in the 8th century AD by the Carolingians, chief among them Charlemagne.)<br />In this novel a proponent of that nonsense has created a popular vehicle with which to attempt to deceive the public into thinking that this thesis is true. Yet it flies in the face of all historic context. From the report about Jesus contained in the writings of Flavius Josephus to the bald fact of hundreds of people who knew Jesus and witnessed his death, resurrection or ascension, and who gave their lives for Him, the contemporaries of Jesus who were familiar with the facts bear tacit testament contrary to this slander of Him. Nor does it square with early Frankish history.<br />There are quite a few writings about Jesus that never made it into the canon of Scripture. When you have read enough of them, then you realize that they are mostly a lot of fantasies about Jesus or those connected to Him. There are reasons they are not in the Bible. They have more in common with second party spinoffs of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, for example, written by people who loved the original so much that they wrote their own fantasy continuations of the story.<br />This scurrilous novel defames Jesus in every possible fashion. In a back handed way, it contends that He lied when He said that He would be killed and then would rise from the dead. It purports that all of His disciples lied in their representations of Him. It says that the crucifixion was a lie, that Easter was a lie, that His ascension was a lie, and thus that His promise to return is a lie. Either everything essential to His coming into the world was a lie or what this book proposes is a lie, couched in novel form.<br />Something else Jesus said is that Satan is the Father of Lies (John 8). Open your eyes and don't be duped by this well crafted lie.ie, that Easter was a lie, that His ascension was a lie, and thus that His promise to return is a lie. Either everything essential to His coming into the world was a lie or what this book proposes is a lie, couched in novel form.<br />Something else Jesus said is that Satan is the Father of Lies (John 8).

B00005JKGZ|5.0|One of the saddest stories I ever heard about Judy Garland took place when she was in England shortly before her death in 1969.  It seems that to impress her latest husband, she trekked down to the MGM office in London to borrow to copy of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis,&quot; which her then-husband had never seen.  To add insult to the injury of her husband's never having seen the movie, MGM's London staff had never even heard of the movie -- incredible but true!  Well, it's too bad Judy's not around to revel in this excellent DVD edition of one of her finest movies.  &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; is a first class Hollywood musical, made in the hey day of the musical genre, produced by a top notch Hollywood studio, and  starring perhaps the greatest cinematic musical star of the twentieth century.  Wow! What more could one ask for?  Well, if there's anything left, it's probably included among the fascinating extras including on this 2-disc DVD.  In addition to great songs like &quot;The Trolley Song,&quot; &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; and &quot;The Boy Next Door,&quot; the DVD includes an alternate track of the gorgeous background score, without any dialog or singing.  There's also an alternate commentary track with fascinating details about the film, the stars, the source material for the film, etc., etc. etc.  An exceptional transfer, the movie looks like the technicolor dyes are still wet.  One of Judy Garland's top movies.  This one was a long-time coming on DVD, but it is worth every minute of the wait. Can't recommend this one highly enough!

At this late in the game, I'd only be restating the obvious.  Every music fan should own this CD!
B000003TA4|5.0|It has been ten years since Nirvana ended with the death of Kurt Cobain, but this album still holds as much power and meaning as it ever did. This is the most influential album of my generation: it established alternative rock in the eyes of the nation and gave a voice to the frustrations and feelings of all young people. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" may be the one song that is an anthem for every child of the 90's. Every song on this album reverberates with the genius of Cobain's songwriting and his feeling. This album is real. In a world where shallow, factory bands control the air waves; Nirvana was a shining beacon of emotion, angst, and artistic integrity that gave hope to people everywhere. Their artistic integrity was a comforting factor through out every riff and beat of this remarkable album, knowing that there was a person out there that understood what you where going through was amazing. Cobain became the friend of every person who understood and truly loved this album. It has been ten years since he left us here on this world to find a way without him, but his art is still here to show us that we are not alone. He is the John Lennon of Generation X; and in the ten years since he has been gone, no one has stepped up to fill the void. The music world has still not recovered from his loss and this album is a shining example of why: he was unique. This album is perfect, I cannot recommend it enough.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Each song has a deep special meaning.  I hold each song very close to my heart.  Thank you Sarah.
1401300901|1.0|I can't imagine this book would have been published if the author wasn't the daughter of the Irish PM. In a nutshell, it's terrible! Truly awful writing, hackneyed plot, just plain BAD. I'm glad I checked this out from the library and didn't pay for the book. Sorry, but there's nothing here I can recommend.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I will make this short.  This movie was so slow and boring that I turned it off 30 minutes into it.  After all the great reviews I heard about this movie I was expecting something spectacular.  I kept waiting and waiting and waiting.  Then I got tired of waiting.

0743454529|5.0|I have been a fan of Picoult's for many years. I was very hesitant to pick up this book because eight months ago, at 24 I was diagnosed with cancer. Then, the talk of stem cell transplants and blood transfusions was commonplace. My brothers would sit at the end of my bed, asking me what I needed from them and that they would go through the bone marrow tests to see who was a match. I told them, only if you want to. I was in so much pain and the thought of inflicting that on anyone else was keeping me up at night. To this end, Picoult does an absolutely phenomenal (sic) job at telling the story of a young woman with a fatal disease. She doesn't focus on Kate, the daughter with APL. She instead weaves her story around those close to her--her father, her sister, her mother, her brother, her sister's lawyer and the GAL. Sometimes we focus so hard on the person with the disease that those around us fall into the background. And they shouldn't because their pain, their choices, their stories are just as intriguing and poignant. Picoult really did her research and contrary to what another reviewer says here, really brings out the complexity of emotions that surround such grave circumstances. There is no wrong or right sometimes; we just go by feeling our way. Picoult always explores the gray areas, and she really does that quite well in this book. Some of the plot is contrived, some of the characters are never fully fleshed out, but it is still a great read that asks a lot of questions and doesn't offer any true answers. But be prepared to cry. It's a tearjerker on many levels and also very HONEST when describing what cancer, or any disease for that matter, does to the fabric of a family.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|This is really about Eric cashing in.  The CD is delivered in a cheesy paper cover rather than plastic jewel box.  The recording quality is sub-standard.  The songs are slick and polished, and don't sound very genuine.  I am a Clapton fan, but the standard he set with &quot;Unplugged&quot; was not met with this release.  In fact, it speaks to why the mass music business is in trouble.  It is overpriced and sub-par effort.
0385504209|1.0|This leviathan of inanity has generated such a tremendous amount of attention that I was suckered into reading it. After doing so, I honestly can't understand why it got any attention at all, let alone the busloads it did... it lacks both the emotional depth of even a mediocre novel and the energy of a Grade C bus-depot thriller. I honestly can't fathom why, after reading this terrible book, one would want to do anything other than try to eradicate any trace of it from one's brain. I could say that it's numbingly pedestrian, that it's deplorably ordinary, or that it's unsettlingly tiresome, but in the end what matters is that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is dull, dull, dull...
0553381407|5.0|It's hard to see the words on the page that describe your life.  When I was reading the book, I'd tell my sister how I hated my parents because I saw them in the book.  I've learned how to apply my new found freedom and still have a polite relationship with them.  My sister used to tell me to put down the book, not to hate my parents.  She then went through stuff with my parents and I gave her the book, her words to me were: &quot;now I understand why you said you hated them&quot;, so do I.  We really don't, we feel sorry for them and for us (when we were little girls).  I accept the fact that I cannot change my parents, but I am a very good wife and mother and alot had to do with reading and applying the principal of the book.  It is not brain-washing, it is facts.  I didn't have everything happen to me that was written, my parents were not alcoholics or incest abusers, they were just very dysfunctional and still are even in their late 60's, early 70's.  I keep them within the boundaries I've set up.  I can never make them see or admit anything that they've done, but I can live with it, because it was them and not me or my sister.<br />It is definately worth reading over and over.  Use it like a bible or reference book.
B0001611DI|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of the greatest horror movies of all time.  However, with this classic film being placed in that genre, it should be noted that this movie is not scary.  It is a terrifying concept for a film though and accomplishes everything that it sets out to.<br />Effects and gore are awesome but dated.  They were top notch when the film was released but will be laughable to younger viewers.<br />Acting is good.  Not great but good.  A little over the top at times and a little too mellow at other times.<br />The setting is awesome.  Nearly all of the movie was shot inside of an actual shopping mall in the late 1970's.  For some of us, it takes us back to the way things looked and felt like back then, and for the youngsters who are into the retro craze, they will get a kick out of it.<br />The music is awesome.  It's funny, it's moody, it's eerie and it conveys a sense of dread.  <br />The writing, directing and editing are all top notch but whar else would one expect form a Romero flick?<br />If you like The Omega Man or The Evil Dead series, you will love this movie.  It's gory, suspenseful and it's funny!  Go get it.
B000099T2L|5.0|EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS BETTER THAN GREAT. THIS IS THE GREATEST CD EVER RECORDED.
B000001FA4|4.0|A classic rock album that's hugely underated, done by any other band \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" would be a wonderful achievement, but meshed between \\"War\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\" TFU has been the [illegitimate] child of U2's masterful career.<br />Best known for \\"Pride,\\" TUF is filled with classic rock songs, from opening track \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" to \\"Bad,\\" which explores Bono's oft-visited theme of heroin addiction, to even the larger more experimental and poetic piece in \\"Elvis Presley and America.\\" TUF made \\"TJT\\" possible and helped strengthen U2's foundation of musical brilliance.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Regarding the review above by &quot;an inspiring musician&quot;, the name Eagles of Death Metal is refering to the band The Eagles. Its like saying the Simon and Garfunkle of death metal. Anyway the album kicks ass, and Jesse &quot;the devil&quot; has a great voice. I recommend this album to everyone!
B00003CXCT|2.0|WHY MUST LUCAS FORCE THIS SPECIAL EDITION DOWN OUR FACE! <BR>I find it to be a terrible act that the UN should move against. Future generations will never know the great music at the end of Return of the jedi, or the glory of the revoultionary model cinematography employed by Industrial light and magic that changed the course of movie making forever. Instead they are to watch a tainted version that has scenes that should have never been seen and computer models that look out of place. Why oh why can't you sell the real version. Instead you make me keep a 15 year old VHS copy of which I no longer own a VCR player.  The normal non special edition of these movies are amongst the greatest movies ever made,  I will never buy the special edition, I urge you to do the same.
B00005JMSE|4.0|The latest comic book adaptation to hit theaters is Hellboy, a non-conventional super hero played with gusto by the great Ron Pearlman, best known for his role as Beast in the Beauty and the Beast TV show.  This time he is the headliner, thanks to del Toro who only wanted him.<br />Hellboy came to this world as a result of a Nazi plan that was thwarted by the Allies.  Raised by American scientist Professor Bruttenholm (Hurt), Hellboy grows up as an agent of the FBI's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, bumping back against the things that go bump in the night.  When the bad guys return to bring evil gods to Earth and start armageddon, Hellboy and his band of \\"freaks\\" jump into action.<br />Filled with action, humor, and special effects, Hellboy is an entertaining experience, even for those who never heard of him before (like me).  Great excapist entertainment.
0807282375|3.0|after reading all three of the books in the series, I'm underwhelmed. the first two books are OK, but this final book was thin, not well put together, and unsatisfying. <br />The characters in general are not well-formed but the two adults who drive the story -- the main character's parents -- were well-high incomprehensible to me. The seemed to be a spate of killing off characters that the author couldn't figure out what to do with. It just seemed a hash of clashing ingredients. <br />I really got the sense there was more material than the author could use and he just ended up squeezing it in. I think fans of the Narnia books (I don't like them either) may find these to their taste.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This movie is pretty good. the battle sequences are quite thrilling even if its mostly c.g. stuff. The only predictable thing is the ending. Although, I dont know how else they could pull it off. I have to admit some of it I didnt really understand like the conversation at the end.  The dialog is confusing too. as the characters talk of prophcies and events that may or may not occur. plus as the visions un-fold to all of Zion the viewer really doesnt know what it means. They mostly talk in gibberish and riddles which can mean virtually anything or any direction. Even seeing all 3 films in a row it leaves you with a feeling of kaos remianing. Of course this may be the directors intent so we never know why we spent our hard earned money.
B00012QM8G|4.0|So, it's a DVD-18 (double-sided, dual-layered). That's OK, although I would have preferred if they had done a 2-disc single-sided dual-layered set instead. Double-sided DVD's have a tendency to get scratched more easily, and I sometimes have trouble reading the tiny print telling you which side is which (printed around the hub).<br />Here's my problem with the DVD, though.... When you switch sides, there is no option available to choose a soundtrack. It simply defaults to Dolby Digital 5.1 English. To select the soundtrack, you must go to the main menu on side 2 and select your language. So much for Spanish and French! If you select DTS 5.1 English, then the DTS trailer plays again before taking you back to the movie, which is a bit disruptive. That is just sloppy authoring. At least on the 4-disc editions of the Lord Of The Rings films, there is a link to Audio Setup before taking you back to the movie.<br />Also, I would have preferred some supplemental info that pertained to the making of the movie in addition to what is offered here.
0790749815|5.0|This is the first movie I ever saw in a theater.  I was five years old and went with my older sister.  I thought the movie  was stupendous. It still is.  As we had no color TV in 1958, I never forgot the shock of the colors on screen. Bright primary (Taxicabs).  This movie is still visualy rich.  The story unfolds like a delightful puzzle. The performances, direction, production are superb. The DVD has an informative &quot;making of...&quot; feature.  The screenwriter portion is especially rich.  Alas, there was only one Hitchcock.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is the one cd I find myself recommending to people over and over and over again.... people I've even just met a second ago.  Music is my life, and this album is music - one of the best moments of music, ever.<br /> Most bands think that they are \\"evolving\\" as a band with each new album they put out. Shamefully, this only ever happens in a production sense. Few rock bands actually evolve musically.<BR>Dream Theater, as always, is the exception to the rule. Their first two albums are the \\"classics\\" according to the cult fans, but all cult fans seem to say that about whatever their favorite band may be. With all due respect to all DT releases, which I am all familiar with, this is the best of them all, as of this writing in the spring of 2004.<br />Do you want to actually get your money's worth for buying a cd? Do you want to have a cd that you'll still be wanting to listen to 20 years from now? Do you want to have a cd where there is something new to pick up on every time you listen, even if it is the 3 millionth time? Please do this band a favor. They practiced music in their rooms for all of their lives when they could have been doing other things, the least you can do is not copy this one from someone, and shell out the honest to god cash for this, so the well deserving musicians get their money.<br />If you love concept albums with amazing vocals, lyrics and plot twists, you'll become addicted to this album. If you hate vocals and just want to listen to good complicated instrumental prog (I hate that word) compositions, you'll love this album too. Heavy riffs? Epic ballads? ROCK AND ROLL? Point made.<br />The guys will always over play, but for a brief multi-month period, magic happened while creating this album - it seemed they could do all the overplaying they wanted to, and still the songwriting would not lose focus. There are some moments where they just seem to go off and overjam themselves out of character of the paced flow of the album, but even many of the highly complicated lines become catchy after awhile! You'll catch yourself whistling the sextuplet guitar fills to \\"Overture\\" in the shower, I guarantee it! I truly believe that is the BEST possible music that can be made; highly intellectual, yet vividly, gutwrenchingly, memorably emotional at the same time. I personally felt that the heart in this band has grown by leaps and bounds since \\"Awake\\", for example.<br />And no example could be truer than the epic moment of glory, the song \\"Spirit Carries On.\\" It is written and paced perfectly. So emotional, words can't do much else here; one of my favorite moments in music EVER is the bridge (\\"Move on Be Brave...\\") where the chords go from e minor to E flat major. Genius! (Of course Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On....\\" deserves the credit for innovation there). Then there's a heart shattering solo in b minor, owing a nod to \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" It seems like there's climax after climax, AND the band manages to keep from overplaying here! All that and the song doesn't even clock in at 7 minutes.<br />There's no way to speak of the godlike accomplishments on this album in any way other than writing a doctoral thesis type analysis. Unless you can't handle heavy guitars (there's some real metal in there), I can't see ANY reason why ANYONE wouldn't be able to find atleast something they would think as incredible here. \\"Six Degrees...\\" is amazing too, but seriously, after Metropolis 2, where else can you go?

B0000AQS6U|1.0|I was disappointed because there were so many duplicates on the two CDs - the quality was good but for the price - I think there was too much duplication
B0000508U6|5.0|In my opinion, I think this album is way better than a rush of blood to the head (not that I don't love that cd as well)...I love his laid back melodies which have a different aura to them then most of the tracks on rush of blood to the head. 'Don't Panic, Shiver, Sparks, Trouble and Parachutes' are just awesome...I cannot even begin to put my finger on what makes this band so great. This CD just makes me happy! I definetly would recommend this to anyone who likes Coldplay and just went to pick up rush of blood to the head... if you're interested in coldplay this cd is well worth the money.
006054094X|4.0|As I learned so many new things from this book and I found it insightful on aspects of Chinese history I am giving it A for effort.   I do agree based on other good Amazon reviewers that the book contains many errors and needs corroboration or dismissal on certain points.  Unfortunately I can't tell the facts from the fiction though the main theses is interesting and deserves credit.    Facts:  Some pretty good maps of the world with accurate details did probably exist before Europeans officially discovered those continents - some European navigators possibly used them.    I am reasonably convinced that Chickens came to the new world from Asia based on this book but when - Pre Columbian?  Need to know more.    Chinese junks were truly extraordinary and China was a world Superpower until around 1700.    What this book most convinces me of is that the claims that Europeans were the first to get here or there is patent nonsense though it was probably trumpetted for the sake of colonial hegemony.  Many continents were colonised by \\"first peoples\\" and then recolonised on subsequent occasions, mainly by seafaring nations like the Maoris.  Who was responsible for the good maps found in pre naval Europe?  Though the Chinese are the best candidates, I think it seems a disaster they wrote so little of it and what little they did was destroyed.  This is surprising for such a great civilisation.  I think when I've read some of the other books I will be more convinced.    I would really have liked some pictures of the junks with more information about appearance and construction.    Fiction or moot points that I'm not sure about:    Other reviewers have pointed out some of the errors.    Here are three I've identified.    1. Mylodon's were probably extinct in the 1420s, carbon dating reveals they disappeared way before this period though the story of them being discovered by sailors is certainly entertaining.  I think this fact could be disputed.  The Falkland Island dogs related to Chinese edible dogs?  Extraordinary, need to know more.    2. A document from the 1420s at Cambridge showing animals and cultures of the world could not show Sikhs as Sikhism is post 1500.    3. The trinity of Buddhism is Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, not Buddha, Dhamma and meditation.    I find it problematic that so much seems to have been done in just 3 years or less 1421-1423 after which it was kaput.  Darwin took 5 years and then a lifetime to put his ideas together.  As Menzies himself explains, the Chinese probably got to the Americas before the 1420s and any cultural evolution took place in S. America over decades (The Chinese monk apparently reached S. America in the 5th Century CE).  The time frames need a bit more explanation.    The historical contexts supplied by Menzies e.g. about the Portuguese are wonderful.  What if the Chinese had not destroyed their navy?  I am now reasonably assured that Chinese probably got to Australia and many other parts of the world.  From the Zoological and Botanical vantages I want to know more.  I look forward to reading similar books to work out how much of this book can be taken seriously.    I cannot easily know of the truths about Menzies claims of various Chinese navigators and their exact itinaries.    I belive Mr Menzies as a navigator and he makes sailing round the world sound so simple, based on stars, the sun or compass and currents that seem to waft you from one place to another.    It is well written with Menzies' wife's money paying for so much research.  He has voiced some powerful hidden scholarship that scholars responsible have hitherto hid under a barrel.  I think this book is an accomplishment of enormous effort and the author deserves congratulations despite the books' flaws.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Personally, Iron Maiden impressed me with this one. Before thinking of getting the album, I had the opportunity to catch them live in July '03, and their set was nothing short of amazing. Wildest Dreams was played during that set, and that's what made me want the album. After buying it, I heard that the first track wasn't all I was in for... High moments like Dance Of Death and Paschendale make me listen to the album repeatedly, yet the song Journeyman took me aback the first time I heard it. Plainly put, the album is worth buying, and more so, worth keeping in your playlist for quite some time.
B000083E79|5.0|The mind boggles at the number of label changes Cher has gone through in her long, long recording career.  Perhaps to Cher, labels are like costumes.<br />Over the years she's gone through Atlantic/Atco, MCA, Warner Bros (twice!!), Casablanca, Columbia, Geffen etc etc.  And by some astonishing feat, they have managed to negotiate successfully to bring all of her hits to the one package.  Amazing, and highly recommended.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I think it may be a bit of a shame this album is in the &quot;jazz&quot; catagory, for although Diana Krall may be a &quot;jazz artist&quot;, on this miraculous CD she simply a singer of standards.... she has style, but (thank God), she sings these songs without destroying or molesting the lyric or melody that so many artists are prone to do today. THE SONGS are the stars on this album, not the &quot;stylings&quot; of a &quot;diva&quot;... how refreshing that is! These songs are not for those with limited attention spans who must have a driving beat and an occasional yelp or cry from the vocalist... these songs are for those who know how to listen and hear truly great orchestrations from veterans like Claus Ogerman (who orchestrated the most mellow of all Frank Sinatra's albums &quot;Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim&quot; in the 1960s).. and this album is a tribute to that very sound. This album is lush, romantic, beautifully crafted and sensuous.. it is for a night of romance and for decompression from the traffic and noise of everyday life. I hope Ms. Krall will give us more albums like this masterpiece. TOP musicians, superbly crafted arrangements and a clear and clean vocalist who respects lyric, melody and emotion make this clearly a 5 star masterwork in every respect.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie, the forth film by Tarantino, is a good movie.  No one can doubt that.  But if you are looking for another \\"Pulp Fiction\\", you'd be looking in the wrong place.  The movie follows Uma Thurman (Black Mamba), who has a real name that is not told to the audience during the movie(whenever she says her name, it is bleeped out).  Thurman had her husband killed in the beginning of the film, where she is shot in the head and awakens years later from a coma.  <br />The film follows Thurman as she attempts to take down \\"Bill\\" and the four assassins he lead to kill Thurman's husband.  The first of two volumes, Volume One focuses on the first two assassins(keep in mind, the second assassin is the first that Thurman runs into during the film- after that point, its only a flashback)<br />Kill Bill essentially boils down to being a samurai vengance film with style.  But the style is the reason to see the film.  The music works quite well with the film, and numerious interesting film techniques are used (including a 15 minute segment in anamai cartoon form).  See this film, just don't expect the best film ever done by Tarantino.<br />And as a side note, if you get uncomfortable with violence and bloodshed, this film is definately not for you.
B00005Y7OJ|3.0|When compared to the incredible, and fairly constant, level of the PSB's earlier work, &quot;Billingual&quot;, for the most part does not fair too well. Tracks like &quot;Discoteca&quot; &amp; &quot;Single&quot; are nearly devoid of the smart PSB melodies of &quot;Actually&quot; &amp; &quot;Behavior&quot;. Instead these rely on a rhythmic departure, a very rigid Latinesque sound, which gets repetitive very quickly, (As do the chorus melodies) and only succeeds (in my opinion) on &quot;Se a Vida É&quot;. As long as you are prepared to sift through the material, you will find some absolute gems:<br />&quot;The Survivors&quot; = is probably my favorite PSB track since, &quot;Behavior&quot;. Fantastic melodies.  <br />&quot;Red Letter Day&quot; = Even with some of the structure being fairly generic, it works... well.<br />&quot;Se a Vida É&quot; = Already mentioned above, but I would highly recommend to purchase the single for this track before, or along with, the album. <br />&quot;To Step Aside&quot; = Is a Solid Effort.<br />If you are interest in trying some post-&quot;Very&quot; straight-laced dance fair: buy the &quot;Somewhere&quot; single. The price is more than right for the phenomenal quality, and running time. The remixes are so distinctive, I listen to them consecutively every time and it never wears thin.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This cd describes human rage, war, suffering, terror, and patheticness with relentless, chaotic music.  There is so much raw power here, that if one listens to this, all problems will drift away far far far into the background.  In only 29 minutes of disgust, Slayer covers all the abominations and atrocities that humanity is capable of.  Slayer shows that either you can sit there and wonder just what this music symbolizes or that you can just bang your head as if up from the dead, and maybe THEN you will understand what this record represents.  For me, this music represents crushing personal conflict.
B000002H97|5.0|Although even I, a huge Metallica fan can admit this album was on the pop side, this was where Metallica was heading anyway. And Justice For All may not have been as commercial but was more polished than its followers, and a SINGLE on MTV(emphasis) was released. All fans should have been expecting this. And Metallica even said themselves &quot;How much faster and heavier can we get(in 1991)&quot;? So the songs on this album are definitely heavy enough that it fits the songs, Metallica maintain most of its songwriting principles such as songs based around E5 power chord,multiple solos in one song, hard, long(no pun)and guitar solos. The low point on this album is easily the last song, while the rest of this album doesn't allow you to skip a single track. However, if you are looking for a way to get into Metallica, do not use this as your guide.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Wow Fred Durst is totally full of himself on this one.  He's got the world by the throat, he's got the chicks he always wanted, he's got total control over his bandmates.... what he doesn't have, though, is a good record.  The filth of commercial music is spilt all over this one, and it oozes of the reek of putrefaction.  Terrible, tasteless arrangements, the most patronizingly annoying voice ever recorded (kudos to mr. limp, fred durst), no talent, pure monotony and endless repetition.  I mean, if you don't have any riffs, don't play em over and over.  You people should listen to Megadeth or something...

0385504209|5.0|As a non-Christian I find this book to be absolutly amazing. Our country was not founded on Christian freedom, but on all freedom. Today we have shows like &quot;charmed&quot; who portray pagans as people with supernatural powers. How is this any different from the DaVinci Code? It takes some truth, adds suspense and fiction, to make a fun book.  This book is based in fact, while the pieces are true and may not add up to be a whole truth, it never claims to. It is true that experts critique the book because of it's factual mistakes, however, the book has got people interested. It has taken hold of the public and sparked people to look into the truth.  Everything in today's society is critiqued and made fun of, just look at the late night television. This book is no different, except that it challanges the majority religion.  Just like the movie Stigmata this book raises important questions and convinces people to look more closly at their own religion instead of accepting the dogma that is handed out. The Lord may be our Shepard, but that doesn't mean we have to be sheep and have no brains of our own.  Anything that challanges the popular view is going to come in for criticism, Galileo is great example. Instead of looking at this book as a theory, people really need to look at it how it was intended: as a work of fiction loosly based on truth. Ladies and gentleman it's in the fiction section for a reason...
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I laughed outloud throughout this entire movie.  I thought it was extremely honest and funny.  It has so much more to offer than your average romantic comedy.  I'm 19 and so sick of the typical and predictable young movie romances.  I thought the acting was brilliant.  At least go see this movie, you won't regret it.
B0000AK7AB|1.0|This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!
6304297912|5.0|This film has got to be the greatest film I have ever seen.  The book was fascinating and the film does a terrific job in portraying the true lives of close friends that are heroin addicts.  EWAN McGREGOR plays the quirky Mark Renton and fabulously shows the struggles of his character's life from addicted to heroin through the trials of life and into his fight to get clean.  This is the greatest film to date, though a little different from most, it's truth and style will stick in the mind of those who view this true masterpiece by the unique director DANNY BOYLE.
0385504209|3.0|It's a good thriller and good entertainment. You'll enjoy reading it. Anything else might disappoint you. The literature value of it is doubtful (who cares anyway in these type of books). And the &quot;facts&quot; have no evidence supporting them and may not be true but it's just a novel, a good novel.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|No words can describe my love for these movies. This is the perfect end to the perfect trilogy. The critics may hate it, but they are supposed to, these movies are extremely anti-hollywood. Just watch it and you will see, it is amazing.
B000005JA8|1.0|ella guru. thats it. i shall use the ceiling function. 1 star.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a terrific DVD.<br />It is emotional without being maudlin. It is a *celebration* of George and his music.<br />The musicianship is outstanding. The musicians are all pros, they don't overplay, the sound is simultaneously very tight and very loose. (Perhaps only a musician would understand the last statement.) I wonder if Jeff Lynne, who is responsible for the sound mixing, left certain instruments out of the mix. At certain points there are 4 drummers, 2 or 3 percussionists, 8 guitarists, and 4 keyboards, yet the sound is not cluttered at all...<br />The material really highlights Georges gift for both lyrics and melody. Eric Clapton, the musical director, did a great job of managing the musicians.<br />For those who don't know: Joe Brown is/was a big star in England and Europe. In fact, the Beatles used to open for him a long time ago, which is how they met. Sam Brown is Joe's daughter. She had a run of popularity in England and still performs and records. She delivers a great vocal on &quot;Horse to Water&quot;. Jools Holland is a popular R&amp;B band leader in England.<br />My only gripes are that Ravi Shankar's piece, composed for the event, is longer than it could have been and the Monty Python segment just didn't do it for me. In addition, I would have liked to have seen some kind of &quot;family tree&quot; that explained the connection that the performers had to George.<br />I got this DVD from my local library and it is definitely on my buy list.
B00008CQS0|5.0|Another great score from Yann Tiersen, and unlike Amelie this is entirely new music composed just for the film. Tiersen sounds even more like Michael Nyman here. Like Nyman, he shows the best that minimalism has to offer film scoring. <br />The music gently massages each scene, conveying the emotions at the core without bothering to hit every action onscreen like cartoon mickey-mousing. Instead, the music finds something deeper and mines it deftly and beautifully.<br />Like the other poster, my only problem with the album is that the music is totally out of order. To help any other fans out there, here's the correct film order, matched up exactly to my DVD of the film.<br />1, 3, 15, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7, 17, 11, 9, 20, 10, 13 (0-1:48), 22, 13 (1:48-end), 12, 14, 16, 19, 21, 18, 15, 11, 9, 11<br />Also, there's a single piece not written for the film, &quot;Comptine d'Un Autre Été: L'Apres Midi,&quot; which is track 4 on the Amelie album. I assume most people buying Good bye Lenin will already have Amelie, so sticking it in the mix should be easy. That track goes between tracks 14 and 16, for when the family drive to The Dacha, which is my title for the track.<br />You'll notice tracks 15, 11 and 9 repeat at the end, those are the end credits. Finally, track 23 is not actually in the film, but I stuck it on the end of my mix CD.<br />Hope this helps, I know I'd have been really glad to find this info a few weeks ago.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The conclusion to the Washowski brothers &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy is a very intense and fun ride but it starts to veer off the road a bit. <br /> Concluding the trilogy, Neo is now in the midst of going into the final showdown with the renegade computer program Agent Smith and a massive army of conscious machines, under Agent Smiths, control are digging further and further into Zion, the last refuge of humanity in existance. The armies of Zion are running otu of time before the final war for humanity starts but it's ultimately Neo who will determine the fate of humanity. <br /> This is a really fun and adrenaline-rushing action flick but the storyline is very hard to follow. I also didn't like some of the acting by some of the crew and like a previous reviewer said, Persephone and Merovingian were absolutely pathetic and could easily have been left out altogether. <br /> Other than that, thsi is a satisfying conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. It's just that it could've been done better. That's all. Otherwise, just go and get this DVD and have a good time!!
B00008PC2O|4.0|Love the movie... just a quick note about the version that comes in the METAL CASE.  It looks COOL, but once I slid it out of the METAL CASE (which was tough), sliding it back in causes the stiff plastic covering on the &quot;normal case&quot; to tear and rip (the sharp metal edges on the metal cover do this.  Maybe I got a badly manufactured version.  Not a comment on the movie, but just beware of the cool case (i had to get rid of it since it was &quot;eating up&quot; the normal case every time I slid it in and out). JUST FYI...
0812550706|5.0|I read this novel for a college class in young adult literature, and when I began it, I wasn't just thrilled. I thought this was the basic science fiction novel that I had read dozens of times before. There wasn't going to be anything special here. But, I went on, and it didn't take very long to convert me. This is a special book that captivates you, and if you look deep enough, has the power to change you.<br />The plot centers around Ender, a child genious charges with the task of developing his mental abilities into military skills to defeat an alien race who had attacked the earth years before. This novel presents his years in school, playing inventive warrior games in space, and his attempt to save the world. He struggles with relationships with the other students (since he is a genious), with the powers trying to manipulate him, and with the intense need to succeed at war games.<br />The plot is so exciting and entertaining, but the novel also raises a lot of questions. There are the ethical questions about war and power, and there is a strong message about love and empathy. The novel also examines the life of children who are smarter than their peers, and it roles of teachers in students life. There is also an insightful discussion about &quot;games&quot; and reality. Lastly, there is Ender's struggle to obtain freedom from the forces manipulating him. His sister Valentine makes the claim that he can't obtain true freedom except by accepting the roles offered to him by the people who love him. He does choose to serve the people he loves and gains some purpose and happiness. I thought it was a powerful message from a truly wonderful novel.
0394720288|3.0|THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS is one of the few novel-length works about \\"intellectually negligable\\" young aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his titan of a valet Jeeves. I found the CODE OF THE WOOSTERS somewhat entertaining, though about two-thirds of the way through it starts to drag and all in all left me unimpressed.<br />Summarising the setup of the novel would be difficult, but it begins with a battle over a cow-shaped creamer. The cow creamer is desired by Bertie's Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom, but is bought instead by Sir Watkyn Bassett, the retired magistrate who once fined Bertie five pounds for stealing a policeman's helmet. Aunt Dahlia gives Bertie a choice between infiltrating Bassett's house and stealing the cow creamer, or never again tasting the wonderful meals of her French chef Anatole. Two related problems are the engagements of Bassett's niece Stephanie \\"Stiffy\\" Byng and Bertie's school chum Harold \\"Stinker\\" Pinker, and Basset's daughter Madelaine and Wooster friend Gussie Fink-Nottle. There's also Roderick Spode, Watkyn's menacing associate and the leader of a fascist group called the Saviours of Britain. The book was published in 1937, and through Spode Wodehouse makes a few jabs against Hitler and Mussolini.<br />In spite of its observation of human social interactions which really are often zany, the novel does seem somewhat far-fetched. A character hears a major revelation but reacts too tamely, the plot's resultion in the last couple of pages seems like an easy way out of a book starting to run out of steam.<br />There are a few moments in THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS which made me laugh out loud, and therefore I do cautiously recommend the book. However, it is a somewhat insubstantial novel, and falls into a three-star rating. If you've never read Wodehouse before, you might want to try one of his many short stories before tackling an entire novel.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Bland soulless crap. A technically fabulous guitarist but boring as all get out when it comes to this album. There is no reason to buy this when you can buy the real thing for less. Perhaps if Mr. Clapton would try to do something original with the material it would be better. If you have to own a Clapton blues record, buy &quot;From The Cradle&quot;. It's much better than this. For the record....Eric Clapton is not a blues guitarist. He's a rock guitarist who plays with a bluesy style. This isn't the blues. It's someone playing a blues song.
B00008IAMD|5.0|This is the first Johnny Cash CD I've bought. I certainly was not disappointed. The combination of his own songs and some covers was sung in a perfect way. I can't believe I didn't buy any record of him earlier. <br />For your information I have not bought many country CDs earlier at all. What I have listened to earlier have been Dylan, Hank Williams among other artists.
B0000039PW|5.0|Whether you are a hip hop fan or not, this is a classic album. It marks a point in old school hip hop, where the music was true and raw.<BR>This album should be a part of any serious music fan's collection. 'Machine Gun Funk' is one of the best singles ever produced, its strength means you can listen to it time and time again.<br />B.I.G's lyrics are so tight! As Lil' Kim says, &quot;B.I.G is still the best rapper&quot;, this album prooves it.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I LOVED the passion of the Christ, I thought it was a brilliant showing of the love that Jesus had for us.  Enough love that he gave his only life for us.  Now i don't get it, WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS MOVIE IS ANTI SEMITIC???? it is soley based on the SCRIPTURES that were written two thousand years ago.  Also, his is exactly what happened to Jesus.  I see no anti semitism and i think Mel Gibson rocks for making such a great movie.  The soundtrack brought me to tears just as the movie did.
B000003TAR|5.0|In 1993, Nirvana released the follow up to Nevermind. Instead of another spike of sing along pop, they released a raw, sinewy, sticky, rotten punk pop masterpiece. This song has pop classics (Heart-Shaped Box,All Apologies,Rape Me,Pennyroyal Tea, Dumb) hard rock classics (Serve The Servants, Frances Farmer..) and punk rave ups (Scentless Apprentice, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, and Milk It). The only weak tracks, &quot;Very Ape&quot;, and &quot;tourrette's&quot; are all that keep this album from being better than Nevermind. <br />  If you are a music fan who only has Nevermind (half of all people who own Nevermind statistically don't own In Utero) check this album out. Rest in peace Kurt.
0385504209|5.0|Or it could be a pain in the *** tryin to figure out which facts are correct and which facts are not. Its kinda good for both kinds of people. If you like reading pulse racing fiction, you'll not want to put this book down. And if you are one of those hell bent on trying to pick faults, you will get lots of leads to do some research :) Either way, you should read it!
B000003TAB|4.0|Incesticide, as I'm sure you all know, is not a formal album; it is a collection of b-sides, rarities and unreleased songs, recorded between 1988 and 1991. This was released only 9 months before In Utero, and was basically used to hold off fans until the 3rd Nirvana album; In a sense, this took on an identity of it's own as Nirvana's 3rd album.<br />   The first song, Dive, is follows the tradition of strong introductory tracks on Nirvana albums; equal parts Cheap Trick and Black Sabbath, the song is their hit song &quot;In Bloom&quot;s Darker, angrier, twin brother. The slinky bass line is among Krist Novoselic's best.<br />  The second song, Sliver, is among the bands best tracks. A spikey burst of cathartic pop punk, this song was the only charting hit on Incesticide, reaching 19 on the Modern Rock charts. Although it deals with themes of alienation, it is among Nirvana's most bouncy tracks, owing much to Kurt's love of The Pixies, and The Vaselines.<br />  The album isn't all classics though; tracks like the terrible, teenage garage band throw away &quot;Stain&quot;, the subpar sludge of &quot;Big Long Now&quot;, and the self-parodizing &quot;(New Wave) Polly&quot; remind you that this album is just a b-sides collection; still gems like &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Been A Son&quot;, &quot;Son Of A Gun&quot;, &quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot;, and &quot;Aneurysm&quot; prove it's a b-side collection worth owning, for sure.
0767020308|5.0|I'll make this short and to the point since that is all the time I have:  It is a wonderfully portrayed story of the novel EMMA.  The charcters were portrayed brillantly by the actors chosen for their parts.  This version far outshines GP's version.  It is more real and certainly more beliveable than the silly &quot;Emma&quot; portrayed by GP.
B000003TA4|5.0|Sure, there are more artistic, and more complex albums. I have over 50 of the supposed \\"classic\\" albums of the 90's. Some are great, some not so great. Nevermind stands above them all though. 12 unforgettable songs, highlighted by the transient beauty \\"Come As You Are\\",  the jealous punk of \\"Lounge Act\\", and the stark acoustic strum of \\"Polly\\".<br />  While other grunge bands like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam were simply rehashed 70's arena rock, Nirvana combined a smart mixture of 70's punk, 60's pop, 80's indie and post-punk, to create some of the most vital music of their generation. No, Kurt Cobain can't shred; but he can write a better song then James Hetfield ever could.<br />   I can't imagine you reading this review; with sales of 10 million copies in the US, and 22 million copies worldwide, Just about anyone who would ever want Nevermind owns it by now. If you don't, get it. Rolling Stone ranked it the 17th greatest album ever; I'd rank it more towards 8-10. This is a true classic, in league with The Velvet Underground and Nico, Blonde On Blonde, and othre great albums.
B0000033TE|5.0|From the first time I heard Jerusalem, Toccata, Still you Turn Me On, and Karn Evil 9.. this has been my favorite album of all time. Greg Lake's voice was the greatest in the business.. he played all guitars; bass, acoustic and lead.. and during Karn Evil 9, he played all.. making this very hard to do live; but the best show I've ever seen. On Toccata, Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer took Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto and turned it into life and a venture into movement as it should be known. I love this piece! As a master percussionist, Carl Palmer really shows what it means to be a perfectionist.  This is the only cd that I own on vinyl, tape, cd and dvd audio... and I upgraded my stereo system just to hear it on dvd audio.. what a thrill, what a thrill!!
B0000019PA|5.0|Inspired by the diaries of Anne Frank, In The Aeroplane Over The Sea shows Mangum mixing his own inner demons into the story of the holocaust; Add a great love of 60's pop (The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Zombies), 70's folk, and 80's indie, and the result is nothing short of spectacular. <br />   In The Aeroplane Over The Sea starts with a very innocent feeling, which gradually morphs into sheer despair on &quot;Oh, Comely&quot;. The afformention track, along with the finale &quot;Two-Headed Boy part 2&quot; are two of the most heart breaking songs I've heard.<br />  If you don't own Aeroplane...I strongly recommend it. Stop buying White Stripes albums, and check out a true classic.
B0000033OZ|5.0|The first time I heard this album was a spiritual journey. I had fallen in love with that voice (Greg Lake) and realized that I would do anything to hear it... Lucky Man was the only single released from this album because it was the only one short enough for radio play, but its not the only great one.  Take a Pebble, Tank, Knife Edge, The Three Fates.. all masterpieces in their own right.. and absolutely amazing to listen to. The first time I listened to The Three Fates.. I was a little taken back by the opening section..with the Hammond, but it goes right into one of the most beautiful piano movements I've ever heard... So its not just the voice.. well not completely anyway..    Put it on, put on your head phones and crank it up.. You won't be disappointed... I'm still considering getting that Dove tattooed on my back..hummmmm!
0812550706|5.0|Being new to the sci-fi genre (this is really the first sci-fi book I have read, if you don't count C. S. Lewis's Narnia series) I write this review with the knowledge that there are probably many things I don't get in this story. Therefore, this review will probably lack some of the depth that could come from a more knowledgeable reader.  However, maybe as an &quot;outsider&quot; to the sci-fi genre I'll have a few worthwhile thoughts. <br />Ender Wiggin is a tormented child genius, charged with saving the earth from alien invaders.  The book tells the story of how Ender is recognized as the potential &quot;savior of the earth&quot;, how he is trained and how he ultimately defeats the alien invaders. <br />The plot is a good one, but the development of the character of Ender is the highlight of the book.  When we first meet him, he is the kid who gets picked on by his evil older brother and the bullies in the neighborhood.  Ender is a sensitive kid who doesn't want to hurt anyone.  However, throughout the book he is put into positions where he has to defend himself.  When he does defend himself he doesn't merely defeat his enemy, he destroys him.  Then he feels guilty about it afterward. <br />The rulers of the earth monitor Ender and notice this, along with his brilliance in computer simulated war games.  The earth has been attacked twice by alien invaders and nearly wiped out each time.  The powers that be expect another alien invasion and so they conscript Ender into leading them in battle against these aliens. <br />While Ender is whisked away into outer space to be trained to save the earth, back on earth his evil brother Peter concocts a plan to rule the earth, and he conscripts his and Ender's sister, Valentine to join him in this.  Peter and Valentine take on cyber identities of Locke and Demosthenes and interject themselves and their opinions into the affairs of the day, and eventually grow to wield great power on the earth. <br />There is a sense in whichthis is a psychological thriller because much of the story has to do with what is going on in Ender's head.  Here he is, the sensitive young boy (did I mention he is only 10?) who is being taught to destroy others and eventually destroy an entire alien race.  His interior wrestlings with this dominate the book.  We also see him agonize with fears of becomgin like his brother Peter, and deal with the fact that the world leaders are using him. <br />The fact that the author chose the names Demosthenes and Locke for two of the main supporting characters is interesting.  Demosthenes is an ancient Greek writer known for his orations against Phillip of Macedon and Locke is known for his anti-authoritarian views.  Since I don't know what was going on in the head of Orson Scott Card when he was writing I can only speculate why he chose these names.  As Demosthenes and Locke, Valentine and Phillip do, over time, undermine the existing authorities and raise themselves to levels of power. This hints at one of the subtle messages of the book, which is certainly seen in the case of Ender - you can't trust the authorities.  In this book, the authorities can't be trusted.  Demosthenes and Locke undermine authority, and Ender grates against the way he is used by the authorities. <br />There is a religious element to the book, albeit a subdued element. It appears that at the time of the story, religion has either been outlawed or done away with.  Ender's mother secretly prayed, and if memory serves me correctly, may have even had the kids baptized or dedicated as small children.  Rather than having faith, Ender is an object of faith in this book. In that sense, he is a kind of Christ figure, but only in a loose sense.  He is the savior of the world.  And, in fact, at the end of the book, he becomes the founder of a new religion. There is even a place in the book where, when wrestling with deeds he has done, he confesses to a real love for his enemies, which is a very Christian theme. At the end of the book, he finds that he is unable to return to earth, and goes off to colonize another world - his kingdom is &quot;not of this earth,&quot; again a very Christian theme.   <br />I admit these religious elements are only there in a loose sense, I am not arguing that Orson Scott Card was operating from any Christian or religous presuppositions, but it is still fascinating to me to see potential connections. <br />The story has a great and unexpected ending - I wouldn't have expected it.  Overall, its an enjoyable book - probably good enough to make me want to read the next one.  Who knows, maybe I'll become a sci-fi aficionado.

B0000029PC|5.0|although i've been a frequent listener to late german romantics school (i.e. wagner bruckner r.strauss), i wasn't particularly fond of early german romantic symphonies (i.e. schubert, schumann, brahms), but this set of schumann's symphonies by szell/cleveland simply draws me in a way only comparable to karl bohm and his schubert/mozart. in sum, this set is simply irresistible music... i have to say among szell's recordings with cleveland of beethoven, brahms, schumann, and bruckner, i value his schumann the most for its natural phrasing... as the booklet says, szell certainly has an affinity with schumann's music.
B000088E6P|1.0|I have both the clean version of the cd, and the regular one. Id give the regualar cd 5/5! its a great cd, but the censored one sounds like crap! they edited the crap out of the songs, and even cut out a song!<br />if u wonder how bad it can be, this is what the edited version sounds like:<br />&quot;Flows, bones, crushin', it's nothin'<BR>I come up with somethin'<BR>Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'<BR>It's something you want, 745 chrome spinnin'<BR>Haters hate that I'm winnin'<BR>Man I've been hot from the beginnin'<BR>************* envy the kid, control your jealousy<BR>'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony<BR>****** in hand homie, I'm down to get it *******<BR>Once I ******* *** ***** **** you know I ain't stoppin'<BR>Till my **** is empty, I'm simply<BR>Not that ***** you should try your luck with, or **** with<BR>******-*** ****** struck you with your bones ******, *** ******', still locin'<BR>what *****, lay your *** down paramedics get you up feeling<br />Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me<BR>* *** ******** *** **** ****, so don't push me<BR>Fill your *** ** **** ****, so don't push me<BR>I got somethin' for your ***, keep thinkin' I'm *****&quot;<br />its really bleeped that badley!<br />this is a really good cd, IF you own the uncensored version. avoid the clean at ALL costs!

B0001AP12G|3.0|Kanye West is a brilliantly talented producer and, as we now see, performer.  However, I get a terrible feeling about the message that his CD sends out.  It appears to disparage the merits of higher education, and the pro-drug references are a little much.  While this CD obviously contains the parental advisory sticker, I'm afraid that some impressionable youth will get his hands on it and take to heart what Mr. West says.  Perhaps a more pro-education, anti-substance abuse message might be more appropriate given the ills facing our society today.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|George Harrison had huge success with his 1987 album, &quot;Cloud Nine,&quot; and with good reason: this is some of the most catchiest, irresistible music George ever made in his solo career. Co-produced by George and his pal, Jeff Lynne (of ELO), &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; contains nothing but absolutely wonderful, infectious pop: the title song, &quot;That's What It Takes,&quot; &quot;This Is Love,&quot; &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; (George's affectionate look back at his Fab Four days), &quot;Devil's Radio,&quot; &quot;Breath Away From Heaven,&quot; George's #1 hit single cover of Rudy Clark's &quot;Got My Mind Set On You,&quot; and all the rest---simply marvelous music. George sings &amp; plays his heart out, and he's joined on the album by a great group of friends, not only Jeff Lynne but also Eric Clapton, Elton John, and his old Beatle chum Ringo Starr. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; is a very happy, upbeat, feel-good album that's eager to please, and it remains one of George Harrison's very best. You, too, will be on Cloud Nine listening to this one!
B00005B4GU|4.0|This CD would have been great if Radiohead would have put Cuttooth, Fog and instead of the 2 instrumentals Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors and Hunting Bears (what the HELL is that song doing here).  And should have put another one of the B-sides from this album on Kid A for Treefingers.
079284131X|4.0|For those that haven't seen Child's Play ever before, don't expect a classic like John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; or anything close, expect a movie that will keep you entertained from start to finish.  Sure, a whole lot of this movie doesn't logically make sense...I mean, the movie is about a serial killer trapped in the body of a doll named Chucky, what do you expect?  So, throw your common sense out the window and just ENJOY.  Everything about this movie from the effects to the cheesy acting strikes me as classic 80's, and I couldn't ask for more.  Sure Child's Play is not technically a &quot;great movie&quot;, but quite frankly, who cares?  Some movies are just fun to watch over and over again and this is one of them.  One of my favorite techniques that the movie uses is that the viewer doesn't ACTUALLY hear Chucky talk until pretty late in the movie which is very effective.  As for the DVD itself, it's nothing special; they deffinatly could have added a lot more on here for a cult classic like Child's Play.  No matter what, if you're a fan of the movie than this is worth getting; and deffinatly a great movie rental for those who are yet to see Chucky and are interested.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Salma Hayek worked for years to bring this story to the screen. The result is one of those rare, perfect films. The casting, cinema-photography, art direction, script, musical score and performances are all stunning. Hayek is clearly much more than a beautiful and talented actress. She has shown that she can take a project from beginning to end without missing a step.<br />I am also a painter, and have always been particularly touched by Frida Kahlo's ability to channel years of physical and emotional suffering into a body of lyrical and stunning work. Hayek's performance captures the complex nature of Kahlo's personality. Alfred Molina is wonderful as Diego Rivera. So often Rivera has been depicted as a one dimensional bad guy, but Molina's performance reflects a more nuanced understanding of this brilliant artist. He may have been a singularly flawed individual; but his reputation as one of the world's greatest muralists in unassailable. Geoffrey Rush was a real treat as Leon Trotsky, a figure whose own life story was cinematic. <br />This film not only tells a great story, but also is one of the best depictions of the creative process that I have ever seen. This DVD should be part of any movie lover's library.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Okay, yeah so mabe Britney lipsinks, but it's a good thing!!! No one can dance like she does and sing at the same time!!! If she sang it would sound like a dog panting!!!!

B0001DI0FI|5.0|I'm a former Naval Officer, and I've read the complete series of books through multiple times.  This film manages to capture the flavor of the books while adding a few twists of it's own.    The movie itself is a course in naval history.  Similar period works like the \\"Bounty\\" opted to almost ignore the complexities involved in operating a ship.  M&C hits you with a lot of them  at the same time, but credits you with enough intelligence to follow it.      No matter what you're looking at; the uniforms, the duties people performed, the tactics, the language, the ship and its fittings, or any other item on the screen, it is both historically accurate and in keeping with the spirit of the book series.  I've heard people complain about the film's depiction of the young midshipmen who acted as junior officers on the ship.  This is how it was, and again the film pulls no punches as to how demanding and brutally unfair this type of life could be.  Others have complained about the \\"cheeziness\\" of some of the spontaneous singing and instrument work in the movie.  But again I give the film credit for daring to highlight what was actually done for entertainment in those days, long before CD's & TV made music a passive, solitary, spectator event.     The only \\"groaner\\" point in the movie for me involved a bad pun referring to some unwanted vermin in the food.  In the books, Jack is relentlessly unquick when it comes to a play on words.  Yet he'll proudly refer back to the rare incidents years earlier when he actually \\"got in a good one\\".  In the book series, this adds another tone to the character; but in the movie it came off as a little forced.  Most people are completely unaware of the state of food supplies on a Napoleonic warship, and the movie could have provided an earlier reference to the presence of mold, maggots, weevils, and rats on the ship; and how these extra passengers were accepted matter-of-factly by the crew.    I was a little worried about Russel Crowe when Iheard he was cast.  The Aubrey character from the books is a hulking, borderline fat, scarred up giant, and I had always pictured the man who played the British officer in \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" whenever I read the books.  But Crowe delivers again.  Bettany is perfect as Dr. Maturin (significant portions of this character are not revealed in the movie and remain a treat for those who read the books).  The only casting choice I had a problem with was Bonden (played by one of the Hobbit guys).  If I remember correctly from the books, Bonden was a prizefighter, not at all a match for the physicality of this actor. (If I've gotten this wrong please forgive me).    One final note is that this movie should have been nominated for, and should have won, an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  To comb through 20 books looking for which bits and peices could be brought together to make a viable, watchable movie, while still remaining true to the source material is an incredible task (the movie differs significantly from the 2 novels named in the title).  This movie pulled it off beautifully.  Even minor characters are given enough screen time to establish them firmly.  From Killick worrying about the silver and muttering under his breath, to \\"Awkward\\" Davies, a man more useful in a fist-fight than for anything involved with sailing a ship.     If you want historically accurate, informative, exciting, complex action, involving some of the most popular, relevant, and influential characters in historical fiction, than this movie is for you.  I highly recommend it.
B000001FDK|5.0|oh, this was THE BEST movie of all times, soooooooooo the soundtrack features the songs(THE BEST PART) my favorite song is summer days... the one where it is so funny b/c Sandy is singing about how he was so sweet and respectful of her and Danny is singing about how they made out... and all that jazz... i LUV this AWESOME movie and soundtrack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is an excellent cd and has a great amount of nice songs, this is one of my favorite cds of iron maiden
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites due to the fight scenes and the special effects. Includes 4 discs. Tons of specials like 4 commentaries, over 2000 pictures, feauturettes, documentaries, galleries, DVD-ROM content, and much much more. I recommend this movie if your into kind of adventure sci fi movies. The ending is the best at the fight scene. It is a good price and a good deal. This will remain one of my favorite movies. If you have not seen this movie yet I recommend you rent it first.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|As a longtime and great lover of film music I bought the score to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; along with &quot;Return of the King&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean&quot; and listened to it last.  To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with it at first, but then I listened to it again a few days later in a much quieter setting....and I promptly did so three more times that same day!  I reassessed my opinion of it and now consider it a very fine score indeed, because it's doing the very job a score should...it is UNDERSCORING the film for which it was composed.  But it is a somber and meditative score, aspects that I do NOT consider as strikes against it.  It's not something one can listen to while driving, but it is wonderful to put on while spending time in a quiet place working on a creative project.  It has the same effect on me as do my CDs of Gregorian Chant, which I love deeply and which enable me to retreat deep into my mind and soul, whether in meditation or prayer or creative concentration.  My applause to James Debney and to Mel Gibson.
B00003CXCT|5.0|THIS is going to be such an awesome set. I have watched star wars for a while now and I get more into it every time. If you loved Star Wars you'll love this. No one would give this less then 100 stars if it were possible. Best special effects from it's time. Includes 4 discs. The movies are \\"Episode IV A New Hope\\", \\"EMpire strikes Back\\", and \\"Return of the Jedi\\". All great. There is even a bonus disc and commentary on each movie. Please buy this to keep these movies alive forever.
0385512104|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book.  My son has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism, and I had heard several recommendations for this book.<br />I thought that the author's character portrayal of an autistic child was well-developed, and the story line itself was interesting, but all of this was outweighed by the incredible amount of profanity and cursing that took place in the dialogue.<br />I was hoping that this book would not only be one that I would enjoy, but one that I could share with my children.  Not so.
B0001IN0DA|2.0|With Wrestlemania 20 being hyped for a year, you think WWE would go out of their way to give the fans the best event of all time. On the contrary, this PPV was just plain boring. <BR> <BR>The return of the \\"Dead Man\\" Vs. Kane: Nice new hat and Coat Taker. Where was the dead man we all were waiting to see? This match was a squash, niether wreslter looked good. *(...)<br />Golberg Vs. Lesnar: I think this match was one of the best all night, not because of the wrestling, but the fans were so into letting these two have it. I would say it was the best crowd reaction since Hogan Vs. The Rock at WM18. *(...)1/2<br />Triple threat- HBK Vs. HHH Vs. Benoit: The only match that lived up to the hype. Great Wrestling, Great story told throughout the entire match. (...)priceless. *(...)<br /> There were a lot of other matches during the 5 hour event, none realy worth watching or recapping. Overall, p1$(...) poor PPV. Do not buy this Wrestlemania!(...)
B00005JLEU|5.0|I went to see this in the cinema last night, and although the style was very much that of Japanese Anime, the plot means that this really doesn't matter. Miyazaki has filled this with wonderful and exciting characters, who are all multi-faceted.<br />The central theme of the film is the emotional growth of a young girl. To begin with, she is the Japanese stereotype of a single child; weak, demanding and completely dependent on her parents. Throughout the film, she grows up to become effectively the strongest and most stoical figure among the characters of the story. <br />What is particularly refreshing about the plot is that none of the characters conform to the way one as a westerner would stereotype them - whether that is the result of differing traditions in Japanese writing or simply the skill of the director do not really matter. The result is a film which works on many different levels and so will appeal to both children and adults alike.<br />The reason I would reccomend this as a DVD is the splendid animation and story board drawing in it. It really is a feast for the eyes, and something that, if you are in any way interested in animation, you would defintitely want to come back to. Unlike regular anime, where all faces are based on a similar construct and use the same contortions for expressions, in this film the drawing of every character in some way describes them as an individual. Only the central character Chichiro / Sen displays the characteristics of regular anime figures, and this is actually very appropriate since she is the only one able to maintain consistently the her human identity.<br />All in all a good film and one that I would watch again - Buy it!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing.  The true theatrical genious of Quentin Tarantino is more than evident in this beauty of a film.  The story follows the tale of revenge of the bride who was shot in the head on her wedding day by her former employer, Bill.  Upon waking 4 years later, she begins a trek to kill everyone who betrayed her.<BR>         Well acted and witty, this movie is a true sign that some good movies are still being made, and restored my faith in the movie industry.  My advice to you is to BUY this DvD... now...
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is quite simply a great album, there are no two ways about it. John Mayer is both a talented vocalist and musician - think Jeff Buckley, but less depressing and more accessible. The songs move from being uplifting, the soulful, to musically fantastic. See below for track description.<br />No Such Thing - upbeat number and the first UK single release. It is one of those songs you want to play when getting up is difficult - and you know by the end you will feel ready to face anything.<br />Why Georgia - less upbeat but great combination of music and vocals in which John sings to some long lost girlfriend. Great stuff.<br />My Stupid Mouth - here John laments his stupidity, albeit in a fun way, in what he has said, since his stupid mouth has got him in trouble. Something we can all relate to I am sure.<br />Your Body is a Wonderland - the title is fairly self explanitary. This is a love song but John is not a crooner and maybe you will sense real feeling in this track, or simply enjoy it for the lyrics and music.<br />Neon - The best track of the album. This combines an amazing guitar lick with really interesting lyrics about a girl he is losing, which seems to be a continuing theme in many of the songs. This one of the best tracks I have heard recently and will really clinch the album for anyone so I am going to stop the review here (if this doesn't persuade you try 1983). <br />All in all a great artist. Buy this and get uplifted by a singer who will make you feel good - maybe that is the point of music??
0780622553|5.0|Dark City is the equivalent of taking a train through a tunnel with the proverbial light at the end being either an oncoming train or the end of the tunnel - except the tunnel is a nasty horror film roller coaster loop without the majority of the gore and bad plot.  (The light analogy is apt; Dark City is one of only two films I know of where no scene takes place in daylight, at least until the end of the film.)<br />If you've never seen this, the plot is a man (Rufus Sewell with an American accent reminscent of Damian Lewis in Band of Brothers) accused of murder being forced to explore the underside of his city - and realizing something is very, very wrong in the very structure of the universe when memories don't add up.  Feared and then supported by his wife (Jennifer Connelly as she just started becoming a superstar), helped at times by an amoral 'psychatrist' who has a lot more up his sleeve than therapy (Kiefer Sutherland acting for a change!), he is pursued by a droll detective (William Hurt) as they question the reality and realize the horror of their lives.<br />The plot works here for several reasons, unlike much in this genre.  The heroes are worth rooting for and clearly delineated against the real bad guys, and the explore-the-world theme that often overcomplicates plotlines this gets pulled along at a quick pace by at first the murder charge and then later the pursuit by the real baddies.  Give the writers credit too - unlike the Matrix, the world created here doesn't borrow extensively from myth and religion and you don't need to watch five times to get the point.  Cinematography is out of this world - and one of the reasons this picked up comparisons to Lang's Metropolis - and the sound track featuring a ton of brass, bass, drums and weeping violins fits.<br />The DVD transfer has good blacks (important given that whole never see the sun thing) and I happened to actually learn things about films in general from the Ebert commentary.<br />A good chaserof this genre after watching the last couple of Matrix films.  Recommended.
B00009V7P8|5.0|A friend of mine brought this album over 4 days ago, and I musthave listened to it 50 times following. Further to this I have also booked tickets to go and see him live; this guy is phenomenal.<br />The beauty of his music is often in its simplicity, not unlike Leonard Cohen, but also the feeeling of the Lyrics. Eachsong conveys a very clear message to the listener. However, the acoustic feel of guitar and then rising strings make you feel you're almost in the music. The music always compliments the heartfelt subject of the lyrics, for example the frustration of 'delicate' with strong rising string cords, but also a chilled slow guitar lick during the more thoughful verses.<br />Damien is clearly a loely Irish boy, but this does not translate to the very heavy lyrics of someone like Sinead o'Connor. A cello frequently compliments his music, and is almost like another vocalist in 'volcano.' The songs often are like dialogue between two people, saying the same thing to one another, but not really listening to each other.<br />My favourite tracks are 'The Blower's Daughter' which then flows into 'Cannonball.' Everything on these tracks sums up the best parts of the album. The great emotional feeling is there - &quot;I can't takes my eyes off you / I can't take my mind off you / Till I find somebody new.&quot;<BR>This then moves into a slightly more upbeat guitar lick of 'Cannonball.' Here he laments a past girlfriend he no longer has with him, and is confused by the subsequent relationship. This moves into a triumphant chorus in which he describes what he has learnt - &quot;Stones taught me to fly / Love it taught me to lie / Life taught me to die.&quot; The contradictions of wht each experience are obvious - &quot;so come on courage teach me to be shy.&quot; at then end it still reverts back to his wanting the girl, this track really also is an example of great musical composition.<br />Other good tracks are 'Amie' and 'Cold Water.' If anyone says this album is boring, they are simply not listening. Tkae a chance, buy it, and if you like it you will love it.
B000000W5B|4.0|Okay, it's not one of the Stones' best, but `Goats Head Soup' is still a fine rock album to own. The problem with is, I suppose, is that's it's not a very good album for hardcore Stones fans (just look at Angie; it's probably one of the worst Stones songs ever, yet it's one of the best love songs ever recorded), but it's not quite good enough to be a good purchase for a wider group of music lovers, like `Exile On Main Street' or `Sticky Fingers' Any way you look at it, though, `Goats Head Soup' is a top notch rock n' roll album with some fantastic songs. Again, the problem is that it excels more in ballads than in upbeat songs - but the ballads aren't good enough to make it an all-around classic like `Sticky Fingers'.<br />So, let's start by getting `Angie' out of the way. By any standard, it truly is a timeless classic and a really beautiful song. Though it lacks the sarcasm and bitterness that add so much to classic Stones ballads like `As Tears Go By' and `Wild Horses', `Angie' is probably one of the Stones' most timeless hits - though true Stones fans like to deny it. There's some great guitar work from Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, as well as one of Mick Jagger's most fantastic vocal performances of his lifetime. `Coming Down Again' is also a gorgeous classic soft ballad, while `Hide Your Love' is harder and filled with blues influences. The best of the bunch is by far `Can You Hear The Music' - hardly a ballad at all, but with a very different sound, with some interesting ethnical influences and great instrumental work on all parts.<br />But the album also has some classic Stones rockers. `Dancing With Mr. D.' is vintage Stones, with Richards giving his trademark raunchy distorted sound, and it's a great rock tune with a great beat. Better is `Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)', a real hard and heavy rocker with great guitar and drums. Finally there's the deliciously naughty `Star F***er', where Mick returns to being as nasty as he can, and he delivers the sharp, stingy lyrics fantastically. The tune, too, is classic Stones with great, danceable rock n' roll beat. All around, a great song.<br />So, again, it's not one of the Stones' best, but for Stones fans it's still an essential, and for other rock fans... well, it's still well worth a listen, even if it won't be a permanent member of your playlist.
B0000959N0|5.0|Because that pretty boy Ben Affleck was choosen to be the star character, I had honestly expected this movie to suck. Fortunately, after watching it, it turned out to be a great movie.<br />The acting is well done, with a very heartbreaking storyline. Daredevil does many stunning airial acrobatic moves. This has everything that I had expected to see in the Spiderman movie (a movie which I hated).<br />Daredevil is a true Marvel classic. It really is better that Spiderman.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I have a confession to make.  I wrote a smug, ignorant review of Explosions in the Sky's thoroughly enjoyable disc, Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, thinking I could finesse my lack of knowledge about the music contained therein and its antecedents without consequence--kinda just wow everybody with nuanced disdain, calling it, for example, &quot;aural mind candy.&quot;  That was unfair.<br />Consequently, I got royally drubbed by the Amazon reading and rating community.  And rightly so.<br />So, I decided to encounter this strange music called post-rock to see if I could set aside prejudice and condescension and engage it on its own terms.  This review constitutes my first endeavor vis-à-vis this project.<br />The first thing that strikes me about GY!BE is their poignant melancholy.  This is a band that has learned how to evoke grandeur amid the sadness of our (post)modern world.  Their main strategy is to build achingly beautiful soundscapes out of rather simple melodic and rhythmic material by a strategy of layering, repetition, and a series of tension/resolution, dissonant/climax moves.  This lends the music a very attractive mesmeric, almost Gnostic, sensibility.  For me, it matters not whether it has any real substance; the aural glories it comes wrapped in lend it a kind of iconographic power seldom found in pop music.  Thus, it is wrong to call it &quot;mind candy.&quot;  Yes, it is elegant and legerdemainic per se.  That doesn't mean it's trivial.  It proceeds from and operates out of a very specific postmodern narrative imbued with glorious sorrow (earned or &quot;lifted,&quot; I don't think it really matters) that for me is entirely compelling, even if it can't be absolutely intellectually sustained.  Its ephemerality is part of its attraction.  There's a certain naïve purity that lends it even greater cachet.  Besides, from a strictly aural standpoint, it has a kind of overwhelming force--cyclonic, chthonic, Dionysian--that cannot be gainsaid:  Camille Paglia transposed into a pop-music key.<br />The second thing that strikes me about this band is their utter uncommerciality.  Could there be such a thing as the uncommerical commercial?  Yes, the plague of the entire underground or alternative rock movement; Kurt Cobain's suicide being only the most visible paradox of such goings-on.  That is, what happens, what do you do, when your underground movement becomes above-ground, becomes the norm?  How to prevent co-option?  A tough question.  One that U2 solved with the release of All That You Can't Leave Behind after the self-parody of Zooropa.  One that, perhaps, GY!BE will have to confront if they get too popular.  In the meantime, they pursue their quirky vision, expanded to include A Silver Mt. Zion. <br />Finally, I hear this band (or at least certain members) espouse ultra-radical politics.  I have little doubt these would be reprehensible to me, a Neo-Con Catholic Christian.  But you know what?  I don't care.  I've never gotten my religion or politics from pop culture, be it Joan Baez, Barbra Streisand, Clint Eastwood, or Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I think Dave Douglas's armchair liberalism is just this side of loony.  And Charlie Haden is a benighted fool.  But I don't listen to them (and I DO listen to them both) because they're political geniuses.  I listen to them because they're MUSICAL geniuses.  And so are GY!BE.  If alienation is what floats their boat, more power to 'em.  I can dig their music without digging their politics.  Besides, it evokes a side of contemporary experience that is entirely legitimate--the alienation and disgust provoked by globalization, multinationalism, and the McDonaldization of the world.  <br />So I eagerly look forward to my ongoing journey into the, admittedly, arcane world of post-rock.  Perhaps I'll be sending more dispatches from the front.  I don't know.  In the meantime, I'll simply bask in the glories of Lift Your Skinny Fists . . .

B000005RST|5.0|My dad bought this CD a long time ago and he has just abought every enigma CD there is. I was not always a very big fan of enigma and now is probably the only time I thought their CD was any good. It just took a while of listening and now it's one of my favorite new age albums.<br />  The very first song I heard from the album was &quot;Back To The Rivers Of Belief&quot;. I thought this was a very good song and I was surprised that it was not included on the greatest hits because I thought it was their best song. Enigma uses electronic music in the background along with gregorian chants but sometimes you just here regular singing. The album starts off with &quot;The Voice Of Enigma&quot; which is like the introduction to their music. The next song &quot;Principles of Lust&quot; has three parts to it: Sadness, Find Love and Sadness[reprise]. Sadness is my second favorite on the album and it is my favorite in that section. &quot;Callas Went Away&quot; features a unusaul kind of singing and it includes some of the same parts from the returning silence of the rivers of belief. &quot;Mea Culpa&quot; is also an electronic piece featuring more gregorian chants. &quot;The Voice and the Snake&quot; also has a strange use of singing in it. &quot;Knocking on Forbidden Doors&quot; is also a good song. I also noticed that there isn't really a break in between their songs, one song kind of goes into the next. I don't think I've ever heard another musician do that.<br />  The extra tracks include new editions of Sadness, Mea Culpa, Principles of Lust and The Rivers of Belief. But mostly they sound the same as the originals.<br />  I think that if you're into new age music then MCMXC A.D. and the greatest hits would be great albums to buy. I have learned from listening to this album that some of you're favorite albums can be ones that when you first heard you didn't like so you should listen to albums for a while before you decide whether you like it or not.
B00001OH7V|4.0|Heroes is a good effort by Bowie, but it's not his best.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Buying this DVD was the best entertainment money I've ever spent  --- it's that good.<br />This DVD takes YOU there! Every song, every gesture, every audience interaction -- it's a fascinating look at our generations Sinatra upclose and personal.<br />He captivated every audience and you'll sure see why.
B000002KKC|5.0|Although not as consistently wonderful as &quot;Rumours&quot;, it is, nonetheless, an essential recording to have by this band.
B000000WJK|5.0|I usually read reviews, but I had to share my opinion on this album. Like many other of the reviewers here, this album is an obsession for me. A friend recommended many years ago and gave me a copy but I couldn't get past the atmospherics and jam quality of the music. So it sat on my shelf off and on. A few years later I put this disc on my new upgraded speakers and was floored by the sheer level of power and grace of the music. Up and down the songs push and pull against Richard's vocals and lyrics which fill in the instruments and not the other way around. I've had this album on loop for probably the last 2 years and it never gets tired. It's an album that is not for everybody, but for those who get it are permanently changed. <br />Side note: I do think that this album lends itself well to drugs especially for those of you who partake. Lights off, volume up, some herbal enhancement and you're Already There.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|It's quite wonderful, especially the track &quot;Wah Wah&quot;.  Unbelieveable that George is gone.  I treasure his music, and this all star tribute is a glorious treat.  The Indian music on the first CD becomes a bit tedious after a few minutes, but bless them, their hearts are in the right place, and maybe I just need to listen to it a bit more.  The second CD is my favorite and contains some of the best George Harrison compositions written.  George, I'll miss you and your music, but thank you for all you've given to us and to the world.  Hare Krisna.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Others here have beautifully touted this magnificent motion picture, and the stunning, amazing, glorious DVD that has been brought to us by the wizards at Warner Home Video.<br />Let me add my voice to those others by expressing my utter amazement at the perfection of this DVD. Warner has already set the standard by which all others can be judged when it comes to bringing classic films on DVD. As they did with SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, CASABLANCA, THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, and so many others, they present the wonderful feature with unbelievably perfect quality, but also a tantalizing array of extras that even make the better Criterion releases look pale in comparison.<br />This is a film for the ages, and for people of all ages. I cannot recommend the motion picture, or this superb DVD presentation highly enough!
B00008ADPF|4.0|&quot;Long Road&quot; is typical Nickelback - but that's good. There are only a few tracks which I would consider &quot;filler&quot;. Otherwise, the mix of slow and upbeat tunes on the track is well balanced. And the lyrics are truly creative. As expected, I'm not disappointed with the disc.
0195067142|5.0|This is a gripping account of combat on Peleliu and Okinawa during World War II, without embellishment, without literary flourish.  The narrative is simple, unadorned, raw.  Sledge--a \\"fugitive from the law of averages\\" who survived some of the Pacific War's bloodiest battles--doesn't allude to Hemingway or Remarque, doesn't reference past wars (except fleetingly in discussing the martial tradition of the Corps); he's not interested in connecting his experiences to the ancient line of wars and warriors.  Instead, he describes combat as it was, as he saw it and participated in it.  Sledge takes readers onto those bloody islands--the relentless fighting on Peleliu, the stinking hell of Okinawa.<br />Sledge stresses over and over again that war is a waste, \\"a terrible waste.\\"  Young bodies are ripped and torn apart; young men are struck down in their prime and stripped of decades of potential life.  Mentally, it is a waste, too.  Exposed to brutal combat, civilized men quickly become savage themselves and, for example, pry gold teeth from dead--and, on at least one occasion that Sledge mentions, from wounded and still living--Japanese.  There are many other moments throughout the book where the reader winces.  And yet, while war is not glorious, there are qualities that men can show under fire, that shine brightly in comparison to the brutality:  love, loyalty, bravery, esprit de corps, compassion.  Sledge stresses those, too.<br />This is not an antiwar book, though.  Sledge entered the abyss of war, endured hardships, confronted death, saw men torn down.  He knows war is not pretty, not fun, not romantic.  And yet he also knows that it is sometimes necessary and that, as citizens, we must sometimes sacrifice for our country.  He concludes:  \\"With privilege goes responsibility.\\"  So it does.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|The Strokes return after the highly sucessful (and overhyped) &quot;Is This It?&quot;, their acclaimed debut. &quot;Room on Fire&quot; doesn`t add much to what they have already done in their previous effort, but it`s not bad at all for a sophomore release that sticks to formula. Although this is basically more of the same and covers no new ground, it still makes for a satisfying listen, delivering strong rock songs like the first single &quot;12:51&quot; or the superb and raw &quot;Reptilia&quot;, one of the band`s best moments (and the album`s second single, by the way). No, the Strokes are not the saviours of rock, still they seem one of the most interesting, vicious and addictive bands around. Let`s just hope that their next record brings something more innovative and creative. <br />A good re-hash.
0140288503|5.0|This is a stunning, moving, fast-paced read, and I regret that I waited so long to read it.  But now that I finally have, I can say it is one of the finest works on modern combat I've read.  With admirable humility, Bowden dismisses his own capacity for military and strategic analysis, and this book isn't so much a book about why as it is who and where and what and when and how.  It's an amazing narrative.<br />Bowden takes us into the world of Mogadishu (the \\"Mog\\"), where warlords struggled for control of the city and where mobs roved.  His comparison to the Mad Max films is particularly evocative.  Into that world were inserted teams of elite American soldiers:  the shadowy Delta Force (D-Boys) and Rangers.  At first things go moderately well, and they come within minutes of success.  But once events take a turn for the worse, they do so rapidly, and the fog of war quickly engulfs the fight.  Soon, two helicopters are down, and the soldiers are trapped in the city, left to fight off angry and armed mobs.  They spend a night in the city before being rescued, but not before they took on harsh casualties.<br />I don't think I've ever read a book on military history that so often left me near tears.  The devotion of these men, their courage and heroism (but they're still just men--or, most of them, just boys of nineteen, twenty, twenty-one), their sacrifice, the near rescues and close calls, the deaths, and finally the rescue--it's all highly emotional stuff.  You root for them, know the cause was a noble one, and yet you're unbearably enraged by how these troops were used and abused by their nation.  This is not an anti-war book, nor is it a patriotic celebration of the American soldier.  It is a realistic, brutal look at modern warfare.  It is already a classic.
630441403X|1.0|Mike Figgis directs this indie offbeat drama that presents the strange and unusual relationship between Ben (Nicolas Cage), a lonesome alcoholic, and Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a crestfallen prostitute. They get to know each other in Las Vegas, since Ben went there to spend all his money and die. What we have here is an intriguing premise that fails to recieve a compelling development, delivering a melodramatic, dull, repetitive and annoying love story between two uninteresting characters. Nicolas Cage spends half the screen time drunk, making his character an irritating and sappy individual, and Elisabeth Shue gives a fine performance in a movie that doesn`t deserve it. &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; tries to be subtle, introspective, intelligent and moving, but it ends up being contrived, boring, patchy and disposable. <br />This film deserves a skip.
0060555661|5.0|If you have only time to read one book on investing, this classic should probably be it.  But if you recently have read some of the popular get-rich-quick books, &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; is a necessary and powerful antidote.<br />The author has an extremely realistic view of the investment world.  He sees the real risk where speculators may imagine there are instant riches.  For Benjamin Graham, safety of capital comes first.  But at the same time, he makes it clear that safety is not guaranteed, even if you do have a properly selected and well balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.  <br />On page 25, Mr. Graham warns the reader that: &quot;There is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately against 'large-inflation' but it should carry more protection than the bond component.&quot;  The author does recognize that: &quot;The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of protection against inflation.&quot;  With this statement, he seems to recognize that inclusion of real estate could make an investment portfolio stronger.  But he does not analyze real estate extensively as an investment in his book because he says that it is not his field.  <br />Too bad he did not broaden his scope and also become an expert in real estate.  If income-producing real estate had been looked at as thoroughly as stocks and bonds in &quot;The Intelligent Investor,&quot; I believe many readers, with most of their equity in real estate, would be calling Amazon.com about giving this book a sixth star.

B00013F38K|4.0|Should you buy the set?........ if you're really a fan of the series, or even if you're new to the series..... I say yes.<br />I was 16 when the series first aired. And, in a few small ways, it helped change my view of life. It has and always will be one of my favorite TV series.<br />But why would I give a 4 star rating if I'm that much of a fan?........ for the same complaint many others have voiced........ the letterboxing. <BR>It's the only thing that disappoints me. <BR>Because of the letterboxing I feel slightly cheated. <br />I'm a big fan of letterboxing for movies......... but that's for movies, not a television series. This was a series filmed for television in the early 70's, so letterboxing is not only inappropriate, it's out right stupid. With all the planning that went into releasing the series on DVD, whoever made the decision to letterbox it was either indifferent to retaining the original viewing, or was so ignorant as to think it would be an improvement........ it isn't. <BR>If it had been filmed in the 1.85 ratio, then this would be a proper release, but since it wasn't, letterboxing crops off the upper and lower parts of the viewable area. There are too many scenes where the tops of heads and character's chins are slightly chopped off.<br />But that's the only flaw with this set I have a problem with, so it's my only complaint.<br />I watched the entire set on my day off....... episode after episode. <BR>Only a fan of this series could do that. I enjoyed every minute.... from the pilot episode to episode 15 &quot;The Ancient Warrior&quot; (with Chief Dan George). And with no commecials and none of the stinkin' station logos constantly in the lower right corner of the screen, it was even more enjoyable getting to watch these episodes again on DVD. <br />And even if someone is new to the series (y'know...... some of you young'ns out there) the stories pull you in. It's more than a Kung Fu series, more than a western series, more than just simply atelevision series........ the stories actually can teach a bit of philosophy, and do it quite well. Considering how todays' shows seem to have drifted away from having the viewer do any actual thinking, it was great to get to watch this series again.<br />So now I'm ready for season 2 and season 3.<BR>Then I'll be ready for the 1986 TV movie Kung Fu:The Movie, this co-starred Brandon Lee playing Caine's son.<BR>And I'll even consider the latter series Kung Fu : the legend continues.<br />I just hope the dimwits producing these DVDs don't letterbox the rest.<BR>But I have the feeling they probably will.<BR>Maybe if enough people complain about it, they'll re-issue the first season in Full Frame............ if they do that, then I'll definately get it again because I like the series enough.

Troy, a self-made billionaire, signs his last will and testament while his worthless ex-wives, children, and grandchildren hover like vultures waiting for him to die from his inoperable brain tumor.

0312983867|2.0|This is the first of Janet Evanovich's novels I've read and I can say so far the style and content is superior to Crusie's in \\"Fast Women.\\" I would imagine \\"Hard Eight\\" would appeal to readers from Germantown and around that area. I, personally, can't relate, and the charaters so far seem a tad \\"tacky.\\" But Evanovich has an easy style and I'll read on and see how it goes...
B000127LW2|5.0|I really loved the Voyager series and I'm glad to see it's finally on DVD.  After collecting most of DS9 new, I've discovered the joys of used DVDs...especially since some of the DS9 dvd's had serious problems and would not play on many dvd players (even the replacements have had problems).  All of my Voyager dvd's play flawlessly so maybe Paramount has figured out their dvd replication problems.<br />I've decided to buy all of the Voyager series used and i'm glad the first season is readily available...the 109 dollar price tag for a new first season set is ridiculous for only a dozen or so episodes.<br />Also, I agree that the packaging is is as clunky and difficult to manage as the DS9 packaging although I really like the look.<br />Other than that, the first season stories are a great start to a great series and I would definitely recommend it for any serious star trek fan.
B000001EIA|5.0|Not since alive have, I feel , KISS come out with a decent live album. <BR>ALIVE 2? It's just songs played live ( or studio? who cares )it lacks feeling.<BR>ALIVE 3  Was not done with heart, there are some highlights and Eric Singer saves this album from total blandness.<BR>ALIVE 4- While much greater than alive 2 and 3, probably lacks luster from the drumming, face it Peter does not have the chops anymore...<BR>Unplugged is one of those things where if ace and peter did it would sound horrible, you need Kulick on acoustic, sure Ace is the best KISS axeman live, but for acoustic, Kulick is right!<BR>Eric Singer, by far probably too good a drummer for Kiss, he is exceptional and delivers the goods to old and new Kiss songs...
B000002GQH|5.0|this album is great.  the first few songs are pretty good: the upbeat &quot;lovely to see you&quot;, followed by the lovely and wonderfully mellow &quot;dear diary&quot; and then the laid back &quot;send me no wine&quot;.  &quot;to share our love&quot; is rather irritating though.<br />but the album hasn't really even started yet.  to me, the album _really_ begins right when &quot;so deep within you&quot; begins.  wow!  one of the greatest moody blues songs.  you wouldn't think it'd get any better, until you hear &quot;never comes the day&quot;, which is without a doubt the greatest most beautiful song on the album.  these two songs are the power of this album, and right at the center.<br />and then there's another lovably mellow song &quot;lazy day&quot;, and by far the mellowest, &quot;are you sitting comfortably?&quot;  a few words, and then a nice ending with &quot;have your heard&quot; with the awesome instrumental in the middle<br />i love this album.  almost as good as &quot;in search of the lost chord&quot;..

0854565620|5.0|There are no words to be wielded that would surely elate this book any further than what others have wrote. I must simply say that if you do not make time in your life to read this most wonderous of novels than I feel sorry for you.
B00000DLUV|5.0|For anyone who group up on the Bee Gees, the live album we all owned and loved was &quot;Frampton Comes Alive.&quot; Alright, I know you have all hidden the vinyl copy of that one away in the recesses of your closet and won't 'fess up to spinning that one 24/7 &quot;back in the day.&quot; Well, I have news: this live album beats any I have heard, it's *that good.* The Bee Gees, like McCartney, have always taken great pains to sing their songs live as closely as possible to the original. I appreciate this and their efforts to duplicate their classics here meet with much success. Particularly amazing is Robin's haunting, gorgeous vocal on &quot;I Started a Joke,&quot; one of the great Bee Gees of all time. Similarly impressive is &quot;New York Mining Disaster,&quot; which shows the brothers still had the ability to harmonize beautifully.<br />The only slight criticism is Barry's high notes and falsetto, which he strains to reach, especially on &quot;Stayin' Alive.&quot; He's backed up with some invisible (and pre-recorded) mystery voices, but his ability to sustain the high notes has decreased with time. Personally, I don't care. This is an awesome live album and for anyone who admires the brothers Gibb, this is something from which you'll derive hours of enjoyment.
B00005MAM2|1.0|I didn't like it. Katsuhiro Otomo has gone too far on this movie based on his graphic novels. Sure it has great animation but the only one thing that hurts the movie to me is Kaori(Tetsuo's Girlfreind) gets killed in it. The reason I didn't like that is the characters that get killed in the graphic novels also get killed in the movie including Kaori. I never liked all his works (except Metropolis) and I think he's a real monster when it comes to uncomfortable storyline and plot.
B0000E64TQ|5.0|This album is one of the all-time favorites and the new technology showcased here will bring you to your knees. I've listened to all of these songs for over thirty years, but the sound quality displayed is beyond awesome, it's like listening to the record for the very first time. I almost had tears in my eyes when I heard the remixed (and improved) version of &quot;All the Young Girls Love Alice,&quot; one of Elton's all-time greatest underrated songs.<br />I bought this album when I was 10 years old, the day it was released. I have listened to it thousands of times since then and never get sick of it. This is Elton at his creative apex, and Bernie's lyrics are magical. There are many underrated gems on this album: &quot;All the Young Girls Love Alice&quot; (this rocks!), &quot;Danny Bailey&quot; (great piano work here) and &quot;Your Sister Can't Rock but she can Rock and Roll.&quot;<br />For everyone born between 1960-1965, this was *the* album of our generation and it's held up beautifully. Elton never was as good as this again and this was his shining, brilliant moment. The sound here goes above and beyond what you've heard on the original vinyl or CD versions. Highly recommended.
B0001ENYKS|4.0|Length - 38:45<BR>Let me start off by saying that this album doesn't really present any exceptional new sound, groundbreaking material or brilliant rehashings of The Beatles. Nonetheless, it's a damn good album, and I'm quite glad that I bought it. As far as the music goes, I think The Strokes comparisons that are being made are valid to some extent. The vocals are strikingly similar on some tracks, the chords and bass sound alike, and the overall energy and exuberance of Franz is comparable to The Strokes. Contrastingly, I think Franz is more exciting, easier to dance to, and the songs are a bit more variegated (I have a hard time distinguishing between most of the tracks on Room On Fire). Another great part about this album is that there aren't any bad songs. There are at least two songs I skip on both Strokes records each time I listen to them. But Franz, solid straight through. In a word, if you're into The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand will be a fine purchase for you. If you care, my favorite tracks include the jaunty Tell Her Tonight, the manic Take Me Out and the brilliant, hypnotic closer, 40'.

0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci code is a fascinating fictional interpretation of the history of Catholicism and the actuality of the Holy Grail.  The only way one can love this book is to not take it completely literally but to read it for what it is as a whole and allow yourself to be absorbed into its story which really is classified as fiction.  It's not so much an attack on the Catholic church as simply a different perspective from a theory claiming that the lifestyle of Jesus and the actions of the Catholic church in the past may not have been as we thought.  It is definitely worthy of the wave of attention it has brought about and is highly recommended.

0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar has got to be one the best novels ever written as it clearly and effectively elucidates to its reader the dark, grotesque place of the mind one enters into in the midst of mental illness.  It refrains from sugar-coating how that sort of experience actually is and how lonely a person must feel to be a victim of their own irrational mind.  Esther Greenwood, a sort of representation in itself of Sylvia Plath, suffers from suicidal depression that leads her through the ever-hyped electro-convulsive shock therapy and eventually into an institution.  This novel seems to never be ashamed of laying out the facts, as disturbing or irrational as they may seem, from the maddening, wrenching scenes of shock therapy to the self-deprecating feelings Plath experienced that constantly pushed her towards suicide.  I think, however, that one has to reach a certain level of maturity or simply experience of age to really identify with this book.  Definitely, further reading of Sylvia Plath's works and life would aid immensely in the comprehension of this novel.  No one should pass this up.
0312263120|2.0|For a book with text on the back exclaiming its virtue as a \\"smart thriller,\\" Digital Fortress is unfortunately full of stupidity.  Right off the bat, the book opens up with various technical inaccuracies, which continue throughout the book.  No particularly specialized knowledge is required to see the technical flaws in the  very foundations of the story.  Beyond that, there are a number of situations in the story where the supposedly super-smart characters can't grasp some basic concept that comes to the intelligent reader very quickly.  During those scenes, I couldn't help but feel like Mr. Brown was writing this book with the least common denominator in mind - keep it slow for the readers who think very slowly.  Never mind how terribly out of character it is.  This is probably worst at the very end of the story, where it takes 4 or 5 very smart characters many pages to figure out the meaning of a fairly straightforward phrase.  They belabor each word, not coming to immediately obvious conclusions about the words they haven't specifically discussed yet.<br />I suppose it's also worth mentioning that there are relatively few surprises in the book.  I was surprised by one aspect of the ending, but throughout the rest of the book, I felt like I was one, two, or even three steps ahead of the author, as if I could have said \\"You take a break, Mr. Brown.  I'll write the next page for you.\\"<br />Over all, I actually did find the story enjoyable, in the broadest sense.  However, it would have been FAR better if Mr. Brown had taken the time to research his facts to make the technical aspects of his story plausible, and if he had set his expectations a bit higher in terms of reader intelligence.  And if not for the fact that I was sitting on a bunch of planes with nothing better to do, I'd have probably not even finished the book after getting through the first few chapters (did I mention the ADHD-inspired chapters?  Few of them are longer than 2-3 pages, and a good numberof them are one page or less).
B000000W5A|5.0|It is understandable that because the Rolling Stones are, well, the Rolling Stones, there are going to be some highly uptight and stingy critics out there.  But I am not one of those critics!  I have been listening to this album since I was 4 years old, with a childlike interest that has grown into fullblown adult appreciation.  You cannot go wrong on this record.  Every track is a raucous, sonic blend of bluesy riffs, wailing vocals, and an overall theme of spontaneity and fun.  Songs like \\"Tumblin Dice\\" and \\"Rocks Off\\" are great songs on their own, but when listened to in sequence with the likes of \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Happy\\" (with Keith on vocals, I believe) this album is a full blown sonic masterpiece that will pump you up and brighten your mood within the first seconds of hearing it.  Largely underrrated in its day, this album is a unanonymous top 20 album of all time for hundreds of critics, and millions of rock music listeners.  If you enjoy the Stones, it is simply impossibe for you to not be enamored with this record.  A classic that everyone should own in their collection.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I was expecting to be blown away by this CD.  It is a fairly sterilized and pasteurized tribute album to Robert Johnson rather than the potential mind-blowing blockbluster it should have been.  Even my favorite track from the CD, &quot;If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day&quot;, was done more powerfully and passionately on Clapton's &quot;Unplugged&quot; effort.<BR>The tracks are all good and enjoyable to listen to, but the mediocre arrangements are simply disappointing.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love Evanescence and their album Fallen. I love every single song on the album, which only for Weird Al's Running With Scissors, has never happened. Im saving up 300 dollars just to buy their first alnum Origin from ebay. Thats how much i love evanescence. And also Amy Lee is sooo hot.<BR>   Fallen is a grade A++
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I set myself up for a huge disappointment when I heard about this CD.  I waited and waited for its release, the anticipation building day by day.  When I finally got it, I was almost afraid to play it because how could anything stand up to that sort of hype?  Well, it is even better than I imagined.  No, Eric did not &quot;clone&quot; the Johnson recordings - what would be the point of that?  Those recordings already exist.  He put his own indelible touch on those remarkable songs.  Other reviewers have derided Eric's &quot;technical&quot; playing - as a low side of mediocre guitarist, it is the delicacy and technical brilliance of his playing that fascinates me.  I love this CD.  Bravo, Mr. Clapton.
B00001OH7O|5.0|I was not alive during the highlights of David Bowie's career.  My mom is a huge Bowie fan though, and I often listen to her cds. Hunky Dory caught my attention because of its title, but I finally listened to it when looking for quotes to put in my paper about Andy Warhol.  I couldn't stop listening.  It's fantastic.  No one song on this is bad, although some I like better than others.  This is a must have for the Bowie fanatic or anybody just interested in an introduction to the amazin David Bowie.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The already famous Clash were destined for a breakthrough, but not as monumental as London Calling. London Calling was their experimental album, and they toy around with rockabilly, reggae, R&amp;B, hard rock, and pop, proving their versatility. Made in 1979, this album sent huge ripples through punk rock that are still seen today. Songs like &quot;Revolution Rock&quot; and &quot;I'm Not Down&quot; paved the way for 90's Ska, and Green Day sounds an awful like &quot;Hateful.&quot; They also made a definite political stand with &quot;London Calling,&quot; &quot;Guns of Brixton,&quot; and &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot;. They even sing about corporate problems in &quot;Koka Kola&quot;. It's only when they toy around too much that they wind up with &quot;Wrong 'Em Boyo,&quot; where the rock becomes watered down by all of these other experimental elements. Overall, London Calling was a solid album that effectively changed Punk Rock for next generations.
0783228007|5.0|I don't understand why this got mediocre to bad reviews,I've seen this movie many times &amp; think it's as good or better than any of his early work.As a bonus you get Robert Duval &amp; Don Stroud(who you know is going to get killed before the end of the movie).<BR>Highly recommended to any Clint fan !
0800141849|4.0|Streisand's third directorial effort was greeted with surprisingly vicious reaction from both fans and critics, nearly all of whom immediately labeled it as an over-the-top vanity piece.  It also had considerable difficulty at the box office.  After opening with strong numbers, the $45 million budgeted film took a nose dive and did not recover.  It ended up taking in $46 million domestically ($65 million worldwide), which was a respectable take, but far from the blockbuster status of films like A STAR IS BORN or THE PRINCE OF TIDES.  When considering all of the above information, it's a bit surprising to discover that the film is nothing more than an entertaining and heart-felt romantic comedy.  In hindsight, it's hard to understand why a such a harmless and light-weight film became such a lighting rod for scathing reviews and harsh comments.<br />While the storyline is predictable, the movie is actually very well-done with a brisk pace, compelling characters, and a witty screenplay.  The finale may come down a bit heavy-handed on the \\"message\\" end, but the build-up is effective enough to merit this indulgence.  Though MIRROR doesn't match her previous two directorial efforts, Streisand does once again pull off the various actress/producer/director roles with great efficiently, and this results in an effective star vehicle for the then-54-year-old film legend.  Jeff Bridges received a lot of flack for his completely unselfconscious portrayal, but I admire how completely he throws himself into the silly role.  Lauren Bacall is brilliantly biting and luminous in her turn as Streisand's mother, a role that earned her first (and so far only) Oscar nomination.  Mimi Rogers is also fun as Streisand's (...)younger sister, as is Brenda Vaccaro as her self-deprecating best friend - although Pierce Brosnan is wasted as a gigolo-like suitor.  All in all, an enjoyably fluffy film, undeserving of the criticism it routinely receives.  <br />About the DVD:  This was one of Columbia's first DVD releases, and while the picture and sound quality are great, there are no extras and the menus are hideous.
B00006LLLN|5.0|If you dig progressive country this album has the best slide dobro I've ever heard.  The backup band is totally hot and is as much a reason to buy this album as is Alison Krauss.
B0001HAISG|3.0|I have seen several versions of the Pan story (notably Disney's and Mary Martin's) and while this story are great special effects and fairly good directing, this movie lacked the fun of those other versions.  Also, the heavy British accents made it difficult to understand what the actors were saying at times.  It was interesting to finally see a \\"real\\" boy play Pan and I guess the movie is a \\"coming of age\\" of sorts for him.  However, doesn't coming of age mean the end of childhood and everything that symbolized Peter Pan?  I saw this film with my young children and both were quite bored.  This movie is probably geared more for older adults than children or even teenagers for that matter.
0780631684|5.0|This is the second most suspenseful film i have ever seen, (the first being Final Destination 2). No matter how ust to horror films you are, the opening of this film will scare the hell out of you, it will have you screaming and crying through the whole movie. It starts out as a group of teenagers on a flight to Paris for a school field trip, when one of them has a premenition that there will be an accident. He gets as many people off the plane as he can. Then they all see the plane explode, but they were supposed to die on the plane so they find out they cheated death. So now death is coming after them and there is nothing they can do to stop it.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I continue to see reviews that basically say, 'The Matrix made sense up til this movie.' Truthfully this movie is deep and full of hidden meaning, but if you saw, and paid attention, to the first two, then this great final piece should have brought it all together for you.  <br />For years, the Oracle had been providing clues to Neo about what it would take to save Zion and end the war, but she could not come right out and draw him a picture. He had to make the choice and evolve into a program that really understood his purpose, and a human ready to give all. It was all about &quot;choice.&quot; All the prior Neos had been forced, which led to the repeated destruction of Zion. Choice was the difference-maker.  <br />Until I saw Revolutions I did not realize that the Oracle was also wanting Neo to see that she and he both would be needed to acheive an ending that would be different than all the prior Neos acheived. When Smith assimilated the Oracles code, he was quite proud of himself, in his own evil way, but little did he know, he had just provided one more piece of the prophecy that would be his doom. <br />It all came together when I heard the Oracles words, &quot;everything that has a beginning, has an end,&quot; come out of Smith before he assimilated Neo's code and then was himself deleted. When I saw the Oracles body laying in that pool of water I said &quot;aha,&quot; The entire prophesy was true, and she and Neo, the program she had been trying to help perfect for a long time, had acheived what none before had. Very deep stuff, but I keep recalling all the times when the Oracle was referred to as &quot;a guide.&quot;  <br />I gave this movie 5 stars because not only was it a very satisfying ending to the Matrix triology, but it is also a bonanza of action and genuine visual excitement. Great DVD.
B000088E6D|1.0|This guy is another wannabe, and the music sounds like karaoke tracks at best. If you want to hear a real crooner, check out Peter Cincotti or Brian Evans. Those are the guys who you can feel have a passion for it. So let this guy ride the wave a little, because the others will rise to the top. As they say, the best are saved for last, and the overly promoted...well they just end up there.<br />The song &quot;Fever&quot; on this album is just terrible. I suggest you list to the sound clips and here it for yourself.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I remember when this album first came out. I was in high school and was trying to come up with some concept of what &quot;my&quot; music would be. I was into Nirvana and the Pumpkins, but who wasn't? When Weezer came out with this album, it changed my entire world. The Blue Album was literally the music I had been waiting my entire life to hear. Now that it's been 10 years since the release of this album, I can say that it has not faded at all with time. It stands as one of the greatest and most original albums to come out of the 90's, or any era for that matter.<BR>As for the special features on this edition of this album, I didn't find anything shocking. There were no, &quot;Why didn't that make the album?&quot; moments. As a hardcore Weezer fan, I actually had all but three of the songs included on the bonus disc. The songs on the extra disc are good, but not life alteringly good. Some of them are really great, and some of them fall a bit flat. As with other Weezer releases, the worst of Weezer is better than the best of a lot of bands out there today, so you definitely wouldn't be throwing your money away on this CD. The Blue Album is as good as it ever was, and the dusty gems are good enough to not make you regret buying them.
B0001IN07Q|1.0|I won't even waste my time on writing a lengthy review. The band sounds like karaoke, and the vocalist sounds like he needs to take the cotton out of his mouth. &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;?<br />I didn't like the songs, and he looks on the DVD much different than he looks in his promotional material, which still call this 31 year old 25.<br />Get it right, and let's get rid of yet another Sinatra wannabe. If you want the real thing, check out Peter Cincotti, or better yet, Brian Evans. At least you can feel they mean what they are singing. Buble is just fell into a well connected group, and Warner fell for it. That is, of course, until it falls off Warner, which likely won't be long if this music is all they've got.
B00006690G|1.0|If you think you're smart because you listen to Eminem, well, you're not smart then. I don't know if he really came from the &quot;gutter&quot; or not, but why does he rap about beating his wife, his mother, and hating homosexuals? I'm not really that shocked because the only purpose of mainstream rappers is to &quot;shock&quot; because there are people out there who will actually throw their money away to listen to some guy whining and cursing every few seconds. I am not shocked or moved by what this guy has to say. His songs aren't deep in any way. I talk a lot of crap about Eminem to my friends, and what really ticks me off is that most of them actually like this crap! &quot;Oh, he came from the gutter so we're going to flush our money down the toilet and listen to his emotional lyrics. You haven't listened to Eminem so you don't know if he sucks or not. We think we're smart if we listen to Eminem because he came from the gutter.&quot; On the contrary, I have listened to Eminem. I hear him on TV, Cd players, some stupid thug playing it in his stupid showoff car. I hear it everywhere! It's impossible not to listen to this crap! Wasn't the 80s such a great decade? Talent was actually taken seriously back then; everybody was listening to rock music and rap was actually not that bad. If someone tries to make you feel dumb for hating Eminem, just say this: &quot;I'm not a slave of MTV, or the evil it promotes. I am a human being who can think for myself.&quot;
B000001EL7|4.0|This is a good album. I still like Rock and roll over better. Anyway to the song's.<BR>I Stole Your Love:9/10 Might be the best song to open any album. Some awesome solo's by Paul and Ace.<BR>Christine Sixteen:7/10 Good song from Gene.<BR>Got Love For Sale:5/10 Not so good song from Gene.<BR>Shock Me:7/10 Ace is on vocals and does a good job. Nice solo with some cool riff's.<BR>Tomorrow And Tonight:8/10 Great song with Paul at his best.<BR>Love Gun:9/10 An ultimate Klassic. The best song from the album.<BR>Hooligan:7/10 Funny song about a drop out.<BR>Almost Human:7/10 Almost a good song.<BR>Plaster Caster:7/10 If ya know what this song is about. Your gonna grin.<BR>Then She Kissed Me:4/10 Dumb cover.<BR>This is not the best album by kiss. It is decent and any kiss fan should know this one.
B000002GJH|5.0|A supergroup consisting of members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog wasn't meant to be a debut CD. It was a tribute, a one-time deal. As a much bigger fan of Soundgarden than Pearl Jam, this CD appeals to me greatly as Cornell fronts just about every song, though Vedder's vocals in Hunger Strike are actually the highlight of the album. Still, I personally think this CD is better than anything that would come from Pearl Jam (though I don't mean to mislead you-this is my opinion and mine alone. MANY would disagree). If I had to compare this album to anything, it would be Cornell's solo album Euphoria Morning. Both show a softer side to Cornell's vocals. If you're like me, you love Cornell's voice whether he's screaming or singly softly and if that's the case, you'll love this CD. If you prefer the louder side of Cornell only, maybe you should stay away. It boggles my mind that there wasn't more acclaim for this album. I've been a Soundgarden fan for a long time, and I hadn't even heard about this CD until last year. Anyway, back to the album, the first track &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot; was the other single from this album, and it's quite good. Other highlights include &quot;Call Me a Dog&quot; and &quot;Reach Down&quot; though there isn't really a bad track on this album, except for maybe &quot;Wooden Jesus&quot; and I just don't really care for that one. In any case, buy this today. If you don't have any money....well, don't steal the album....maybe steal the money to buy the album???? I'm kidding. Any readers who may be associated with the law, I kid! I kid! Except about the buying the album part. That part I meant. Seriously. I guess I could suggest a solution to the not having money thing that wouldn't be....you know, illegal. Put in some overtime. I know it'll be painful because your job sucks and your boss is always making passes at you, but trust me, this CD is worth it! Seriously.
0385504209|5.0|This book was riveting, had more twists and turns than a roller coaster!<br />Once you start reading, you wont want to put it down! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves suspense, action, history!
B000002UAC|4.0|I can't give this album five stars, simply because it ISN'T a five star album compared to their later masterpieces.  Still, this is a wonderful album to listen to.  It is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and get your foot tapping.<br />This is the Beatles before they were world-renowned as the best band ever.  This is the Beatles before even Beatlemania had even hit its stride.  This was the Beatles when they were just recording albums.  It is filled with both Beatles originals and cover songs.  However, in the case of this album (unlike &quot;Please Please Me&quot;) some of the cover songs outshine the originals.<br />Don't get me wrong though.  &quot;All My Loving&quot;, &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot;, &quot;All I've Got to Do&quot;, &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; are all great.  In particular, the popular &quot;All My Loving&quot; ( a cross between a ballad and a rocker) and the minor-key Harrison debut &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot;.  <br />But the rest of those songs are outshined by the Beatles fantastic covers of &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Til There Was You&quot;, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; and &quot;You've Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;.  This is a compliment to the Beatles.  They rocked on almost everything they recorded.  The only disappointments here are the awkward and forgettable &quot;Little Child&quot; and the out-of-place &quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot;.<br />Overall, a home run for the boys and a sign that things were just getting better with each recording.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|from the moment I saw \\"it\\" I fell! I received the DVD last night, and took my first peek, this morning.  The transfer to DVD is outstanding, in my opinion.  Having been born and raised in St. Louis, this movie is very dear to my heart, but I think if I lived in the Outback, it would still have been a favorite.  Judy Garland is at her best in glorious Technicolor. This is not your typical musical, so don't expect any big production numbers, ala Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.  The songs fit every scene, which move the plot along.  If you've never seen Meet Me In St. Louis, I think you're in for a treat, but I'm sure other reviews relayed the story, so I won't bore you with details.  On the DVD, Liza says a few words, and it is a delightful touch to this release.  I listened briefly to the audio commentary track (no time to watch right now) and I simply cannot wait to hear it in its entirety.  The narrations I did hear were wonderful, including songwriter Hugh Martin relating a story about writing \\"The Boy Next Door\\". This DVD is a long time coming, for me, but I am not disappointed. I must have a MMISTL night at my house!!  \\"...right here where we live.  Right here, in St. Louis!\\"
B000068IEU|1.0|Wow, don't bother.  I have been told time and time again that this is one of the most disturbing movies ever made. If disturbing means cartoonish, bland, poorly edited, complete with amateurish acting - then disturbing it is. I may have half-cringed at a few of the scenes, and maybe it had some cinematic value for 1972 - the year it was released. And sure, it may be strong coffee for the squeamish, but I can't help but remember The Wizard of Oz having more moments of spooky dramatic tension than this. If you want a genuinely disturbing Wes Craven film, watch The Serpent and the Rainbow. I look back now and laugh at how hesitant I was to watch this crap burger of a film out of fear of how frightening it would be. Another 90 minutes of my life, and not to mention $4.99, pissed away.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine did a poll and placed Rubber Soul as the fifth greatest album of all time,in addition,Michelle won a grammy as best song of the year in 1966 and In my life was voted the greatest song ever in a 2000 best song ever poll!!!
0064407667|4.0|I was a bit reluctant to pick this book up at the store, but I did, and I'm glad I did.<BR>  Lemony Snicket has a most unique way of writing such a bleak story about three unfortunate orphans who are made to live with a horrible relative.  <BR>The story is not based on its character development.  It's based on the interesting plot, which is kind of disturbing though. <BR>This book is a bit fantastical and this horrible situation would probably not happen in real life, but it is still a pretty good read.<BR>  <BR>The story is so strange and different, you just have to try it.  Also, the books get even more interesting as the series progresses.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I started to watch the series on TV and I fell in love with it. It's so great. Every kind of tv show is in smallville. Romantic,Drama, Action, Science Fiction !! everything ! It may looks expensive .. but it greatly worths it.. In my case its my first DVD set that I buy of my life and I dont regret it !!<br />Smallville Rocks and I love it !! Cant wait for Season 2 ! i'll buy it !! Give it a try guys !!
B000002UAU|5.0|This isn't my favorite Beatles album, but it is one of the most important and influential albums of the 20th century.  While it lacks the instantaneous and accessible charm and humor of earlier recordings (&quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; included), it is also a more band-orientated record than either The White Album or &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sits comfortably somewhere in the middle.  The band wasn't collapsing quite yet, but they weren't the same lads from Liverpool who had recorded earlier music.<br />While this album leaves you feeling ultimately satisfied, it isn't exactly the perfect album many people consider it to be.  Not all of the songs are complete masterpieces (as seen on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; or even &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;).  Some are actually worse than their earlier music.  <br />John Lennon is in an interesting period on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.  He is still as witty as ever, he hasn't yet met Yoko, and he is still interested in trying new things.  Eventually, he would lose interest in being a Beatle (and it showed).  However, most of his contributions to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; are too good to forget.  &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; is one of Lennon's masterpieces.  The lyrics are trippy and imaginative.  And the chorus is so warm and fun and an instant classic.  His other best contribution is &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;- a mini-suite featuring haunting vocals from John and a beautiful melody.  The rest of John's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; work pails in comparison to these two songs.  I've never been a big fan of &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, though it is an interesting song.  And &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; may be catchy but its an obvious work song.  <br />Paul, however, is really in his prime on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.  Most of his songs are great.  The title track is a catchy rock anthem and a perfect opener.  &quot;Getting Better&quot; is also catchy with nice guitar.  &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; isn't one of his best and neither is &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;.  They are more mood pieces than anything else.  He recovers with the fun and silly &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; (one of my favorites on the album).  Paul really had a knack for writing psychadelic rock.  <br />George makes one contribution to the album: &quot;Within You Without You&quot;.  I have mixed feelings about the song.  When I first heard it, I didn't know what to think.  I didn't like it.  However, I have grown to love.  Just give it a chance.  It has great lyrics and the use of Indian music is done very well.  I just like George better when he has a little fun.  <br />Ringo mentioned in &quot;Anthology&quot; that he learned to play chess on this album because he never had much to do.  However, he does have two shining moments.  He's fantastic on &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;.  It seems like every Beatles song Ringo sang was made for him (and maybe they were!)  He also showcases his drumming ability on &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot;.  <br />This album is so important, it would be impossible to not own it.  The highs are high and the lows are low.  Overall, though, this is one incredible album.
B000063DFN|5.0|Simply put two minutes to midnight is the best track they ever done. Great guitar riff and great lyrics. Powerslave another excellent tune as is aces high and back in the village. The Duelist is the weakest track. Losfer words is good. The Ryme of the Ancient Mariner is long but great in parts and it got me into Coleridge's poetry. Great poem...epic.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I guess Im not exactly a purist when it comes to a movie like Daredevil since I don't mind movies that are different from the comics, but I do like comic movies that draw from existing ideas about the characters. That's why I like Daredevil. The writers used the comics and animated stories as source material and I was impressed with their research into the character. The origin is different from the book, but true to the one given in the animated Spiderman. They didn't just take the name Daredevil and fudge the rest of it, but they really investigated Daredevil's various histories. Nice job!
0060512806|5.0|Normally, a book of this size would scare me silly. I can't read anything too long without falling asleep or day dreaming. This book held my attention every page! I found myself talking vividly about it to anyone who'd listen. Of course, it all sounds insane unless you've read the book but that didn't stop me from babbling on about it.<br />I loved the detail! So many authors shy away from complicated details for fear that they'll loose their audience. Neal just keeps on going and you have to hold on from falling off but it's worth it.<br />It was like food for my brain and wine for my spirit the way inspiration is for invention... and I'm thirsty for more! :-)

B000002UAX|5.0|Let me get write to the point: this is my favorite Beatles album.  As I went through the Beatles catalog on amazon.com and reviewed each one with care, I couldn't wait for my chanceto voice my opinion on this... the Beatles best.  A lot of people agree with me and many disagree.  When it comes down to it, the best album the Beatles made is personal preference.  Every album is fantastic.  For me, this is it.  The best album of all time.  <br />The White Album includes everything.  Every musical style in existance was dabbled in on it.  Jazz and blues sit comfortably by country and rock and ballads and avant garde.  After studio experimentation on \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", they decided to wipe it all away and get back to basics.  The album cover is stark white and gives listeners no overall mood to cling to, as the cover of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" did.  The White Album can be enjoyed however you want to listen to it.  Everyone feels something different when listening to this sprawling musical odyssey. <br />(...)<br />The White Album has something for everyone.  It is such a huge album with so much on it.  That's the beauty of it.  If you don't have a copy, how can you call yourself a fan of music?
B000063COX|4.0|I still like most of this cd after all these years especially Running Free...great bass line..high energy song. Translyvania great instrumental....Strange World really good almost a ballad..Prowler cool feel....Iron Maiden one for kick butt mood. I don't like Charolette the Harlot all that well, however. It's not for the faint of heart.
B0000029GA|5.0|this is tha best east coast album perhaps ever put out... i love this album.... it has great ryhmes and u kno wat.. tha beats may not be tha best but pleeez! this is simply great... this is Nas's best album he ever put out but if your looking for beats... check out Doggystyle or tha Chronic or any of Dre's work... but if yur looking for ryhmes... this is it!!
B000000WA4|4.0|I'll start with the good: Mellon Collie is a good album with a lot of good songs. From it, the Smashing Pumpkins have released some of their best singles, such as 'Tonight Tonight' and '33'. It has a lot of more experimental songs such as 'Thru The Eyes of Ruby', which is a fantastic song. It has soft, sweet songs such as 'Beautiful' and loud, angry songs such as 'XYU'. It includes very serious songs and more humorous songs, such as 'Lilly My One and Only'. (and yes, ladies and gentlemen, that song was intended to be a joke. You're taking this band way too seriously if you don't realize that that song is a joke) All in all, this album definitely establishes them as an art band.    However, while this was their best selling record, this was not their best record on a whole. A lot of the songs, such as 'We Only Come Out At Night' and 'Porcelina of the Vast Oceans', while they were both good songs, were cleary put in the CD so that they would have enough songs for a double album. They were 'fillers', if you will. 'Farewell and Goodnight' was clearly put there so that D'Arcy and James could sing. 'Take Me Down', also sung by James, was a great song, but it was very out of place.    It becames very noticable very quickly that it is a commercial record. Not a bad record, in no way a bad record, but not their best.     It's a good record to start with if you're just starting to get into them. (where have you been?! J/k) It has some of their most well known songs, and some of their catchiest tunes. It has such awide variety of music that most people will find a song they will like. However, to find some of their best work, I would suggest Siamese Dream.
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce can sing for sure. But, the beats are just ... blech.Her first single and first song on the album &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is the only good song.I must say I'm disapointed in her.Her second single &quot;Baby Boy&quot; is stupid.Especially that Sean Paul is in it.You can't hear what he says.OK, back to Beyonce.Her 3rd single &quot;Me,Myself,and I&quot; is so boring.The 4th single &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; is boring, too.Who knows what her 5th single will be.Probably a boring one.<br />Tip: Buy the single &quot;Crazy In Love.&quot;
B000002UAI|4.0|Sure, it isn't &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; or &quot;Help!&quot;, but &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; is a fine album.  It gets paled a lot by critics and fans alike, but we must look at it objectively.  This was released at the end of 1964.  That's also the year the band filmed &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, created the soundtrack, appeared on Ed Sullivan, toured America, toured Britain and was lost in the fevered screams of Beatlemania.  The band was tired.  You try doing all of that and still releasing the perfect album!<br />&quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; is also a transitional album.  It is a strange blend of the early Beatles sound (evident in &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; and the &quot;Kansas City&quot; Medley) and of their new sound.  John Lennon spearheads the band's flirtation with folk music (as inspired by Bob Dylan).  Lennon's songs on this album are among his most self-depricating and sad.  However, the first three songs of the album, all by him (&quot;No Reply&quot;, &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; and &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;) are all pop gems, never mind their sad subjects.<br />The other Beatles aren't exactly slouching on the job either.  Paul wrote the lovely &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot; (one of my favorite early Beatles songs) and the catchy and interesting &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;.  Ringo ripped up when he sang &quot;Honey Don't&quot; with a voice filled with fun and enjoyment.  Thank God for Ringo, right?  George (my favorite Beatle) sings only one song, the only slightly-catchy Carl Perkins song &quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby&quot;.  However, his guitar is as good as ever, as seen on &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;.  The best was only to come for George.  <br />It is a step down from the all Lennon-McCartney &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; for several reasons.  The album includes covers and the music isn't as interesting.  However, the number of covers is only 6 of 14.  While some aren't exactly amazing (&quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby&quot; jump to mind), some are great.  Both the &quot;Kansas City&quot; medley and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; are great rockers.  And the Beatles sound great on the Buddy Holly ballad &quot;Words of Love&quot;, one of my favorites of the album.  <br />So, in short, put this album into context and you'll understand its tired feel.  However, it's still great and still the Beatles.  Pick up a copy!
B000063DHL|4.0|This cd has four excellent tracks on it, Wasted Years, Sea of Madnesss, Heaven can wait, and stranger in a stange land. The other songs could have used some work the title track being the best of these. Alexander the great has it's moments but it get's bogged down.
0783225849|4.0|Regenerated in many other movies, the legendary `shower scene' will always be carved in the mind of every horror flick fan as the best horror film in the vault. Hitchcock knew what he was doing when he created the film \\"Psycho\\". Hitchcock brings an eerie, yet attractive feeling to every aspect of the stimulating film. The audience, surprised at every twist and turn of the film, was kept in suspense. The suspense is surprising for such a seemingly simple plot. The plot, acting and suspense are the best aspects of this film. <BR> Janet Leigh's character, Marian Crane, stole 40,000 dollars from the Phoenix real-estate office she worked in. Marian took her newly embezzled money to California to surprise her boyfriend. They would use the money for their new life together. On the way to California, she got caught in a storm. Pulling over, Marian found an old, vacant motel. Norman Bates, Anthony Perkins's character, manages this motel for his overbearing mother. Soon after Marian came up missing, Norman became skittish as police began to investigate her disappearance. His character developed throughout the rest of the film, as the truth became closer and closer.<BR> The acting in this film is original because it pulled the audience in with its reality. Anthony Perkins's performance was unbelievable. His mood swings and quietness led the audience wondering what was going on in his mind. His eyes shift and are uneasy at every question. Hitchcock made the audience feel as though they were sitting there with Norman and Marian having a conversation. In the later version of the film the acting did not make the audience feel as though they were in it.<BR> In the 1998 version of the film, the actors and actresses spelt out what they were feeling, leaving nothing for the imagination of the audience. The acting was very unrealistic. The new version, throws in more (...) advances and striking images than the original, which took away from the movie. It tried to shock the new viewersin the way that the original had when it first came out, but in doing so, the quality lacked.<BR> The original was in black and white, but still it was one of the best films I have ever seen. The absence of color helped to bring the audience back to earlier days; when blood and gore weren't the only thing a horror film was good for.<BR>With only two murders within 60 minutes of each other, it set the standards for today's horror films. A little sex and violence was the first layer to the horror film `cake'. Today's horror films have too much frosting. The film \\"Scream\\" glorifies bloody murder and gory scenes, which pulls away from the basic plan, the cake. It is refreshing to watch a simple and beautiful horror film.<BR>The lack of surprise is one of the best things that Hitchcock could have done for the film. Surprise can make the audience jump, but that is a short thrill. Suspense creates a long lasting thrill that will keep the audience guessing. In the shower scene Hitchcock shows the murderer slowly walking towards Marian. We, the audience, know Marian is going to die but the suspense of not knowing when is invigorating. <BR>\\"Psycho\\" is definitely a classic and deserves to be called so. The film exposed the thoughts of psychological issues, setting our own traps, and cold-blooded murder. Images from this film will stick in the audience's minds. Hitchcock is a brilliant man. I suggest seeing any Hitchcock film out there. His films are marvelous works of art.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I normally do not review movies which I have seen, as the experience of seeing them is enough for my senses. After reading some of the reviews here I felt compelled to share some of my views.<br />I was introduced to Mr Tarantino's by my daughter with Pulp Fiction, which I must say was an experience that I throughly enjoyed. Afterwards I could not wait to see \\"DOGS, JACKIE\\".<br />My impression of Kill Bill made me think of the stylish<br />60's type movies.....Matt Helm & Our Man Flint flicks came to mind. The 60's campish influence of TV's Batman & Green Hornet was evident in this film, not to mention AL Hirt's Green Hornet sound track clearly brought back memories for me as a child.<br />Traces of British TV's The Avengers with the (DiVAS).. who could not smile to see one of the vilian with an eye-patch..<br />All in all I found this movie refreshing and entertaining.<br />Can't wait for vol2
B000002UDB|5.0|While this isn't really an &quot;album&quot; per se (the first side was the soundtrack to the film and the second was a collection of their singles of the period) it is a truly incredible group of songs.  The song list reads like a greatest hits album.  This is the Beatles at their most psychadelic.  And unlike many other rock bands of the time who tried this style of music (the Rolling Stones especially) psychadelia actually suited the Beatles.  They were really shining in this period.  <br />John Lennon contributed only one song to the actual soundtrack of the film.  However, this song was &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;.  This is one of his most brilliant compositions, from the use of sounds, to the sound of his voice, to the incredible lyrics.  It's a classic.  John also wrote the beautiful and haunting &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;- which happens to be my favorite Beatles song.  The words are so poetic and the melody is so sweeping and breathtaking.  John also collaborated with Paul on the fun &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot; and wrote the classic &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; (such a straightforward message wrapped up in a perfect pop melody).  <br />Paul really did the most on &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.  He wrote the bombastic eponymous song (a great one to sing along with).  He also penned &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;, which is one of his best ballads.  &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; is damn catchy and classic McCartney.  Paul also shined in the singles realm.  &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; still sounds fresh and fun and fun of energy.  And &quot;Penny Lane&quot; is one of Paul's best songs ever.  <br />George and Ringo didn't have much to do on this album.  George contributed &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, which is one of my least favorite Harrison songs.  I just don't like the dark melody much.  But George plays guitar great on the rest of the tracks, so let's overlook that.  Ringo didn't do much.  He didn't even sing a song.  All four Beatleswrote the silly instrumental &quot;Flying&quot;, but that's about he did.  <br />This is a great album, practically ripping at the seams with its classic contents.  The second half alone garners &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; five stars.
B000063DI9|5.0|I think this is their best cd based on the srehnght of the title song seventh son, can I play with madness, Moonchild and especially the two songs the prohecy and the clairvoyant. Infinite dreams is a good tune and only the good die young is good too but the wekest track on cd. This cd is a little less heavy than previous cd's but it doesn't prevent it from combining great guitar work with synthesizers and excelent lyrics and production.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|... these are their Greatest Hits... As in Hit SINGLES!!! Yes there were many, many other great tunes, but really, IMO, GNR never made a bad song... This album I give 5 stars only to GNR newcomers, but you'd be better off just buying all their studio albums... they only had four... plus a double live album and one cover album... get 'em all!
B00005JLSE|5.0|&quot;Chicago&quot; is spectacular. What impressed me the most was how theatrical the film really was. It stuck exactly to the script of the original Broadway show and captured the essence of Fosse's original choreography. I was blown away. I already knew that Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing, and of course she impressed me (as always), but I was stunned by Renee Zellweger's outstanding performance, as well as Richard Gere's. They were all fabulous: even Queen Latifah was good (now there's something I thought I'd never say!).<br />It was an amazing film that really captured the &quot;razzle dazzle&quot; of the stage show, very brassy and daring and energetic. I loved it. Everyone needs to see it. I'm glad that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; started a trend and that the movie musical is making a major comeback.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is the first album of the middle period of the Beatles.  A lot of people say that it is their first really good one, but I disagree.  All of their early albums are great, especially the startling &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and the fascinating &quot;Help!&quot;.  However, there is no denying the simple elegance of the truly classic &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  <br />From the first note of &quot;Drive My Car&quot; to the last note of &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a very interesting album.  The Beatles were really starting to experiment in the studio.  Double-tracking was used more often, new instruments were being used and let's not forget the actual subject matter of the songs.  &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;In My Life&quot;, and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; all depart from the subject matter of all previous Beatles songs: love.  The music is just much more interesting here than previously.<br />John Lennon is still in control of the reigns within hte group here.  He had not yet lost interest in being a Beatle, and was really turning out some great songs.  &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is a wonderful song about one of John's many affairs.  It is made a classic by George's sitar.  Lennon also contributes &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; (close harmonies beautiful), &quot;The Word&quot; (which tries to get across the message that would later be heard in &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;), &quot;Girl&quot; (a great song about his dream girl with awesome breathy noises on it), &quot;Wait&quot; and &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (both of which aren't exactly genius, but catchy).  However, John's real shining moment on this album is &quot;In My Life&quot;, a beautiful song about his life that is one of the Beatles' best songs.<br />Paul McCartney also begins to deliver more interesting songs on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, though all of his are about love.  However, it isn't a happy love but one filled with confusion and angst.  &quot;Drive My Car&quot;is really catchy and uses metaphor perfectly.  &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; is a great song about his disatisfaction with girlfriend Jane Asher.  &quot;Michelle&quot; is one of his great ballads.  And &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; is one of his best songs with the Beatles.  <br />George is my favorite Beatle and I'm very glad that he finally hit his writing stride on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  His two contributions are among the best on the album.  &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; is an awesome song that features Paul on the fuzz bass.  &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; has incredible close harmonies among John, Paul and George.  Ringo is also in great form on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  His drumming is solid and interesting and really holds together many of the songs.  He also gets his first writing credit (with John and Paul) on the country-tinger &quot;What Goes On&quot;.  <br />Overall, this is a truly fantastic album and the beginning of the real peak in the Beatles' creativity.  It belongs in everyone's collection.
B00005JM20|5.0|Rowan Atkinson as Johnny English is an absolutely incredible combination. The movie is hilarious, and has most of the spectators in hysterics by the end. After swallowing the overdramatic &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, this spy movie is a funny relief. <BR>The sense of humor is not obscene or vulgar. It is more refined than &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and hence I recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh. <BR>The characters are fantastic, the music is great, and the plot is the best of them all. Have fun watching!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Both my husband and I loved this movie, which shocked both of us.  He's very much a lover of action movies whereas I prefer romantic comedies.  We went to the cinema to see this film together and we both came out feeling really good.<br />It's both funny and serious, happy and sad all in one movie.<br />Well worth watching... again and again
6305657947|5.0|Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, a billionaire executive who decides to have a little fun by stealing a priceless Monet from his own museum, basically just to see if he can get away with it.  Enter Renee Russo's character, Catherine Banning, a high-class bounty hunter hired by the company that insures the painting who is intent on proving that Brosnan is guilty.  Despite her professional obligations, she cannot help but fall for Crown's charm, and the two enjoy a fabulous romance while still trying to outmatch each other.<br />Brosnan and Russo have incredible chemistry.  They compliment each other perfectly on screen and make the most out of every scene, both the silly ones and the serious ones.  Denis Leary has a great supporting role as the detective working on the Crown heist, and his scenes with Russo are excellent as well.<br />The plot is very enjoyable, and there are a lot of twists and turns along the way that the audience doesn't see coming.  Crown's final \\"prank\\" at the end of the film is absolutely priceless, as is his final scene with Russo.  This is one instance where a movie remake is ten times better than the original.  I'm glad that there are plans to make a sequel.
B000002UA9|4.0|The only reason I'm giving this album only four stars is because I know what's to come.  I know what's five stars for these 4 boys from Liverpool.  However, this is one heck of an album.  They were still just four wide-eyed boys with a love of rock n roll.  They weren't trying to make a life-changing album or to use advanced studio techniques.  All they wanted to do was record an album.  And boy, did they.<br />This is a wonderful rock album.  Though it is a time capsule of the sound in the early '60s, it still sounds as fresh and interesting today as it must have then.  Drawing from both a huge catelog of early rock songs to cover and also from music written by Lennon-McCartney, this is a fascinating album. <br />The Beatles-written songs blow the cover songs away, an early indicator of their genius.  &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; are rock classics.  You cannot hear &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; without wanting to dance around your house and grin.  It's such a happy and fun record.  &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, and &quot;There's a Place&quot; are also great.  <br />This isn't the most amazing thing the Beatles would ever release (obviously) and it isn't even the best of their early work (that would be &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;), but it is still a wonderful album that showcases the ability of these four lads to really create MUSIC- not just hits.
B0001ENYKS|3.0|Franz Ferdinand has a good sound. The debut CD is a good CD, but I don't think it's as good as everyone else says it is.<br />If your into catchy pop songs, then this CD is something you probably won't regret buying.<br />Their songs are short and catchy. For me, the best song on the CD is Matinee. <br />Some songs fall short of the mark, but others are really good.<br />Steve
0767803434|5.0|Harrison Ford has certainly become the quintessential action hero. He started off in the mid - 1970s' as Han Solo in the \\"Star Wars\\" series. Then, his starpower went through the roof with the \\"Indiana Jones\\" trilogy. After a dry spell, he bounced back as CIA agent Jack Ryan in 1992's \\"Patriot Games\\" and its sequel \\"Clear And Present Danger\\". In the interim between these two films, he starred as Richard Kimble in \\"The Fugitive\\".  In the 1997 vehicle \\"Air Force One\\", he played an unlikely action hero - The President Of The United States\\".<br />Ford is President James Marshall. He seems to be the embodyment of the American dream. He has a loving family, and seems to be the leader in the upcoming election now that he's captured a Russian general responsible for the death of millions. But that all changes when he announces that the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists at a convention in Moscow. But that all changes on the flight back to Washington. A group of Russian terrorists led by Gary Oldman hijack Air Force One. When they threaten to kill, Ford is forced to choose between going against his policy or sacrifying lives of the passangers on board - including his wife and daughter. Nonstop action combines with convincing acting, especially by Ford, Oldman and Glenn Close as the vice president. In fact, Ford is so convincing, it makes you wish he was really president. Great film.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I had a feeling I'd like this movie when I saw the trailers for it, but I had no idea that it would completely blow me away.  Every aspect of this movie is incredible.  Baz Lurhmann combines spectacular theatrics with a tender love story.  Nicole Kidman is fabulous as the lovely cabaret singer Satine, but Ewan McGregor is the real star of this movie.  He has one of the most incredible voices I've ever heard and could easily abandon his acting career to start a rock band.  The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Jim Broadbent as the MC/owner of the Moulin Rouge and Richard Roxburgh as the slimy Duke who will do just about anything to get Satine for himself.<br />People have complained that this movie is &quot;all over the place.&quot; I've read reviews that gripe about the spinning camera shots and the fact that none of the music is original.  What is WRONG with these people?!  The fact that music from so many different genres is represented in this film is what makes it so brilliant!  Even though the film is set in the 1890s, people are belting out classic Madonna and Elton John standards right and left, and it totally works with the environment that Luhrmann has created.  The unconventional camera shots help to illustrate the glitzy and glamourous world that these people have created for themselves at the Moulin Rouge.  Nothing about this movie is annoying, it's unique and incredible.  People who aren't very open-minded when it comes to originality probably would disagree with me, but too bad.  It's their loss.<br />This two-disc DVD set is also one of the best Special Edition DVDs that I've ever seen.  The design elements of the menus have the same flashy style as the movie itself, and there are a ton of entertaining bonus features.  This is definitely a movie to add to your collection.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is, hands down, the best album of the Beatles early period.  It roars along with shuch a shining and one-of-a-kind energy.  It is also the only album EVER released that features Lennon-McCartney songs exclusively.  All the rest include either covers or a song or two by George.  This is a brilliant album, one which belongs in every collection.<br />I don't look at this album as two-sided (the first side being songs actually featured in the amazing film) because the songs are all wonderful.  &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is still as exbuberant and fresh as it was in 1964, kicking off with the most famous chord in the history of rock.  &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; is insanely catchy and I always picture the Beatles singing it on the train when I hear it.  &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;And I Love Her&quot; are both great ballads composed by Lennon and McCartney, respectively.  &quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance With You&quot; is perfect for George's voice.  &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is a happy, hip rocker without much of a point.  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; is a rock classic and one of McCartney's best.  <br />The second side is just as good, with songs like &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;, &quot;Anytime at All&quot;, &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; and &quot;You Can't Do That&quot;.  For God's sake, everything about this album is perfect, even the cover!  Buy it!  It is spectacular.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|The social commentary was annoying in the extreme after awhile - the consistancy of it. Shut up already. I like that it was weird and it did make you think - not about life and the here and now - more like a what if... <br />Decisions... had he done it before? because he never should have known what he knew - Why did the rabbit follow him (because he cheated death - did he, if the plane didn't exsist yet? <br />All so dramatic... and yet, I liked the characters. Even the annoying and crazy ones. <br />Love was the all important motivator in this movie, because despite it all, that was what kept the characters going and what most all their actions were based on when it was important (ie mom taking sister to dance contest, most all of Donnie's decisions) Nice message if you saw it. It's subjective though. The movie is.  <br />The song Mad World so popular now - and so OVER PLAYED - I loved it in this movie. And the 80s references were fun. Overall, a good movie that probably deserves 3 1/2 stars. <br />Also See: Run, Lola, Run (if you don't mind subtitles)
B00000G3PL|5.0|One of the greatest film series ever to grace the screen, the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series has been immortalized with this amazing boxed set. And with 4 of some of the finest action movies ever made, who wouldn't want it?<br />1987's &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; is where it all began. Danny Glover is Roger Murtaugh, a decent and respected cop who has a beautiful home, &amp; a loving family, plus a hefty pension to boot. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is just the opposite. He lives alone on the beach. He is a suicidal wreck, about to snap at any moment. But he can still blow any s.o.b who comes within a 50 - foot radius of him. So imagine the surpris when these are put together to solve a mysterious suicide. Well, the result is magic, complete with spine - cracking action and plenty of humor. A classic.<br />1989's &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; finds the two cops back on the street. Murtaugh is still the family man but now is more of a risktaker, while Riggs still is the daredevil of the two, but has calmed down... somewhat. When Murtaugh's house is invaded by German criminals, the two begin to crack drown on a drug ring operating somewhere in the city. The duo is put in charge to protect a murder witness named Leo Getz (a hilarious Joe Pesci), a big - mouthed money launderer who somewhat helps the team find out what they need to know. This is another great addition to the &quot;LW&quot; cannon.<br />After a 4 - year absence, Riggs and Murtaugh are back (along with Leo) in 1993's &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;. And now they have a new addition to the crew: Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), an Internal Affairs agent who turns out to be the perfect match for Riggs. what ensues is a race top stop a crime ring selling armor - piercing bullets that could kill with one shot. The most action -packed &quot;Weapon&quot; yet, including Gibson's amazing jump 80 feet of a roof on a motorcycle.<br />&quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; came after a 5 - year hiatus. I know that many consider it the low point in the series, but I enjoy it. Things have changed for the two cops. Murtaugh's family is about to grow bigger with the addition of a granddaughter, and another child. Riggs has seemed to have conquered his demons and lives with Lorna, who is also expecting a child. Leo is now a cop as well, and still doesn't know when to shut the hell up. Now, the team has to stop a Japaneese counterfeit ring. What ensues is a great chase sequence, high - octane humor and great kung - fu sequences. Adding to the fun is Jet Li as the villian and Chris Rock as a cop on the force, plus the godfather of Riggs' new child.<br />This is a great boxed set, perfect for fans of great action movies. I highly recommend it.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown has done a great job with this novel. Although many premises on which the foundation of this story builds itself, and to which he alludes within his novel are still today of a controversial nature he does a great job of rattling the cage of Christian History. From the birth of Christianity to its modern day state, Brown grips the reader with suspense, mystery  and a great deal of enlightenment throughout this history-unveiling book.<br />Although the premises of the story may not be fully founded, and the facts of history are spread thin with controversy, the overall appeal is good because of the authors ability to continuously affect the reader in a way that most other books cannot.  Dan Brown went out on a limb to write a book that challenges the history of a popular faith and taking this book for what it is, a fiction novelists latest attempt to write a bestseller, it's a very dynamic book that you won't be able to put down.<br />Without getting into any details of the book (as this is a mystery novel that must be experienced without such give-aways) i'll say that the only thing that i did not like about the book was that, as it went on, the chapters seemed to get too short, and scenes jumped around too much. I would prefer a 10 to 20 page chapter that tags you along a story line more than the 2-4 page chapters Brown has opted for.<br />Historically, no matter what faith you believe in, this book is going to make your head turn with his connection of Da Vinci's life and work to the blood line of Jesus Christ Himself. I would recommend this book to those novel-seekers interested in History, Mystery  and Suspense.
B000002UAR|5.0|It's been said before and I'll say it again: this is one of the best albums of all time.  I personally think it's the best the Beatles ever did (I like The White Album and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; better) but it's definetely their third best.  This is the real turning point in the Beatles career.  &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; started the transition, but &quot;Revolver&quot; really completed it.  This album has everything on it and every song on it is absolutely wonderful.  Nobody has ever approached music the way the Beatles did.  This is evident on &quot;Revolver&quot;.  <br />This is the point in the Beatles' career that Paul began create more songs than John.  The early Beatles career was dominated by John's hooks and by his voice.  When he began to lose interest, Paul sort of took over the reigns.  John contributes some great songs to this album, but only some of them are among the best of the album.  &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; is interesting and lazy and it includes backwards guitar, but it isn't one of my favorites.  &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; is my least favorite song on the album.  It just doesn't feel complete to me- like there is something missing.  &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, however, is a great song featuring some awesome guitar.  &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; is one of my favorites on &quot;Revolver&quot;, mostly because of the amazing guitar riff.  John himself doesn't care for it, though.  Lennon's best contribution to the album is &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;- a song which is impossible to describe.  You have to hear it to understand its genius. <br />Paul is in great form on this album.  All of his songs are interesting and completely different from one another.  &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; is one of my favorite Beatles songs.  It's got such interesting words and arrangement.  The lyric &quot;Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar&quot; is fantastic.  &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; is a great ballad and it was one of John's favorites ofPaul's.  &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; is a happy little song in the vein of the Lovin' Spoonful.  &quot;For No One&quot; is a moody ballad with great vocals and a French horn solo.  &quot;Got to Get You Into my Life&quot; is one of my favorites because it's so much fun.  <br />George (my favorite Beatle) almost steals the album from Lennon-McCartney (something he would actually accomplish on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;).  He delivers an impressive 3 songs, all of which are great.  &quot;Taxman&quot; is one of his very best; a sarcastic rocker and the perfect opening for the album.  &quot;Love You To&quot; is the first song George wrote specifically for the sitar and it's great.  &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; is great with amazing piano.  <br />Ringo also shines.  His drums are as good as always, holding down that steady beat and he sings &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; better than anyone else could have.  <br />Overall, this is a wonderful album, one of the Beatles best and it should be in your stereo right now!
0671024256|5.0|Being a writer myself, I have read many books on writing, but exercises about subjects that bore you are worthless. Here is finally a book about writing that inspires, a book about the true 'craft' of writing and not endless exercises and examples. Just the plain and simple truth about what being a writer is all about. Thank you, Stephen King!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|First off, cover songs are good.  There isn't a better way to pay tribute to the artists who inspired you.  Not enough artists do covers nowadays.<br />Sure, there were a lot of good songs left off this compilation, but the ones they put on are all great anyway. In my opinion, however, Appetite for Destruction was a greatest hits album itself, as every song was great.<br />There's too many people complaining about the amount of covers.  If you do a cover and you put out a fresh new spin on a song, then good job!<br />The only thing that is needed now is a true GnR tribute album.  Bring You To Your Knees is a joke.  Where are the GOOD artists?  We already know AFI can kick ass on My Michelle, so who else? (AFI covered My Michelle on Fearless Records' Punk Goes Metal)<br />I'm now just waiting for the release of Chinese Democracy and Contraband (Velvet Revolver).  While CD isn't likely, Contraband will be out in June and looks like it will be great.<br />People, this CD is great, but don't stop OR start here.  Appetite for Destruction is where you should truly start your collection.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Best Science Fiction / Action Film, doesn't that just wring THE MATRIX.<br />I dont know what to say at this point of time, but this film was outstanding in 1999, and I am sure it wouldn't have been forgotten even if the 2nd and 3rd film weren't released.<br />The Matrix really opens your mind and makes you think 'WOW, amazing'. The story line is as famous as the well-known matrix style action. Although many people didn't understand the film they still enjoyed the cast, the clothes and the action, AKA me at first! The entire trilogy was great in my opinion, the two films that followed were not as mind bending as the original Matrix film, but the action and SFX made up for that!<br />10/10 Trilogy.<BR>Own it all. (The Matrix, The Matrix Revisited, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions and The Animatrix.)
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Simply perfection.  In a world where the charts and radio waves are cluttered with mindless preassembled auditioned bands playing music written by everybody except themselves, this is a welcome break.  One of the better cds out there.  It is mainly an extention of the cd \\"Is this it\\", which is by no means a bad thing.
B00000420F|5.0|Cecilia Bartoli is indisputably one of the best representatives of Italian singing nowadays. In a time when many singers sacrifice clean-cut singing for screams, sobs and other tricks, Bartoli's straightforward approach stands out. Her instrument is not the most powerful but because of her solid vocal training she can be heard in the last rows of a theatre. She can tackle the most difficult coloratura but also sing a legato line with great warmth and exemplary evenness of tone. <br />The arias she sings are simple but never simplistic. Standard arias for a young singer but listening to Cecilia here makes me wonder how many legendary sopranos or mezzos would be able to sing these pieces so skilfully, expressively and with beauty of tone. Listen for example with how much intelligence and expressiveness she handles Paisello's &quot;Nel cor piu non mi sento&quot;. Each song has its own character and Bartoli knows exactly how to sing it. Truly a lesson of Italian singing! The only aspect that I sometimes find less pleasing is her occasional aggressive singing. This however only occurs when she embellishes a lot.  <br />I greatly admire Bartoli not only for her operatic achievements and tastes (she's a ardent Tebaldi fan) but also for her devotion to classical singing only (she refuses to become a crossover singer). <br />Don't miss this lovely recital!
B00005AQE8|5.0|Fresh out of jail, the infamous Tupac Shakur recorded his latest and first double album &quot;All Eyes On Me&quot;. Filled with anger, pain, sadness and relief, this two disc cd is pure gold to its listener. 2pac was not just another gangster rapper, his music still lives on years after his passing for a reason. Shakur was the 90's modern philospher/revolutionist.  Nobody spoke pain and struggle better then this man, and it breathes through his music. Whether you live in the suburbs or on the streets there's at least one song that will speak to you. But Tupac was also a hypocritical and confused man and it reflects in his variety of topics. I wont speak on the track listing because almost every song on this album is solid. Don't take my word for it however, buy any Tupac release or read &quot;The rose that grew from concrete&quot; and enter the mind of a soldier. RIP TUPAC SHAKUR
B0001BKAEY|3.0|MOTS from the invisible Wachowski brothers.  'Matrix Revolutions' is really two movies: 1) The boring, gibberish-laden love, philosophy, and technospeak sequences, and 2) the exciting, spectacular effects action portions, mostly contained in the last hour of the film.<br />The plot is pretty much the same muddled gunk that we saw in the first two films, rife with long treatises that really don't seem to mean much of anything. A notable example is the meandering speech by the Frenchman (aka 'The Merovingian') in the dance club - what the heck was that?  I dare say that the writing quality diminished with each sequel...<br />Thankfully, there is notably less grandiose posturing by the Morpheus character in this 3rd episode (Laurence Fishburne); he actually seems to have an inferiority complex sitting next to Jada Pinkett's ship pilot.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) seems less confident in his 'The One' capabilities.  Of course, he summons up the strength he needs by the big finale.<br />The action sequences were simply spectacular.  When the giant boring machines pierce Zion's walls, hordes of Sentinels pour in, to be met by a hail of fire from the phalanx of APUs awaiting below (the Sentinel 'clouds' appear to be based on massive schools of fish, flowing in unison).  It is truly a huge battle, taking up nearly 20 minutes of screen time.  When Neo meets Smith for the final battle, it is truly cataclysmic, with explosions of water, rock, and buildings that approach nuclear in scale.<br />Overall, this film deserves to be rated right in the middle: 2 1/2 stars.  The shallowness of the characters, babbling dialogue, and stereotypical love story are balanced by awesome effects work.  What is lacking here is a great story to work with.  In my mind, this trilogy is a long way from what is now the consensus definitive example of the genre: Lord of the Rings.  The Matrix series seemed to get worse with each episode from a plot standpoint, while 'LOTR' built up to a crescendo with 'Return of the King'.  The Matrix filmakers did not have the luxury (or difficulty) of having a true classic piece of literature to base their work on.  Because of this, 'Matrix Revolutions' is pretty easy to forget after watching.n of the King'.

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Jethro Tull was all but finished as a major concert attraction by the time of this live recording from their 1978 &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; tour. I think Ian Anderson realized that if he was ever going to capture a live document of the classic band, he'd better do it quick. A year later, 3 of the five members of Tull were sacked and the band as we knew them ceased to exist.<BR> <BR>Yet even as they had arrived at the end of their glory days Tull remained a superb, dynamic rock band in concert, virtuosos playing powerful, complex music with apparent ease. Despite the new focus on the folkier side of rock, a few classics make it into the set as well. The version of Crosseyed Mary played here alone is worth the price of the CD. Martin Barre on electric guitar and Barriemore Barlow on drums are stunning. This newly remastered version is a clear step up sonically, and now includes all the material from the original 2 LP album.<br />I only wish Anderson had thought to put out a live recording like this one a few years earlier, when the band - and the music - was truly at its best, around the Thick as a Brick era.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|this is an above average chick flick with mediocre acting but the movie bring along allot of fun and sweetness that it earns worthwhile viewing and replay status.
B00005JM0B|3.0|I have to say, when it was first release in Malaysia, some like it and some don't. I for one was apparent a little bias because the Terminator was created by James Cameron vision. Jonathan Mostow on the other hand was trying to be better than what Cameron did. Somehow it fail in the sense that its not only action all the way, but the essence of the series just concluded by itself instead of just what Cameron gives us viewers a chance to see what the future would be... in our own hands.<br />But let's get to the movie first on this DVD. The movie isn't the best and yet, isn't the worst. It has its qualities - humor, action & twist. Other than that, the movie starts off with a B-Graded feel with an ending that gives us fans an ending. But is anyone satisfied? To me, its like killing off the franchise. We can't avoid the future? Its fated that these machines will fight us to the death? And everything in what we believe in means there is no point in fighting to stop a future that is already written even many times? Well, I'm sure James Cameron will be dissapointed with this 2nd sequel. So are the fans. But then again, if you take it as an entertainment value, its good enough to enjoy.<br />Now comes the extras. 1 deleted scene (Sgt. Candy Scene) and it explains why most T-101s looks like Arnold. Thank you for the deletion. The documentaries... truthfully, I slept through it. The gag reel isn't that funny. But other than that, its just okay for me.<br />To add in with your collection? Why not, at least its much better that \\"Terminator 2: Jughment Day (Extreme DVD)\\" edition. So just look at what T-3 has to offer for you first before you decide whether to buy or not. As for me, I bought it because I like the Terminator series.

I expected annoying, druggie music, but now I think Kurt Cobain is a genius.  He has a beautiful voice and all the songs on this album are amazing.  Even though some people say this CD is too pop, it's still amazing and it shows how talented Kurt Cobain, David Grohl and Chris Novoselic are.  <br />RIP, Kurt Cobain
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie comes with two discs, the second being the special feature disc. It is loaded with tons of special features and just as many easter eggs. Features include: &quot;Making Snatch&quot;, storyboard comparisons, deleted scenes, video photo gallery, TV spots, theatrical trailers, direct link to &quot;Snatch&quot; website, and filmographies for many main characters. &quot;Making Snatch&quot; is a 24 minute featurette that includes behind the scenes interviews with some of the actors and staff. There are only five or six deleted scenes available, and they are not very entertaining...there is a feature on the first disc called &quot;Stealing Stones&quot; where you can watch the movie, and when the diamond pops up on the screen you can press enter to see where the deleted scene should have been.<br />One of the neatest things I saw was the video photo gallery; it has tons of behind the scenes photos. The TV spots are the previews that we saw on television before the movie came out in theatres; there are two of those.<br />Now for the easter eggs.  The first is located on the second disc, first menu, go to the &gt; arrow, and press up on the remote control, you should see an ! on the screen somewhere, press enter to see a short compilation of just about every time the characters say &quot;****&quot; during the movie.<br />For another easter egg, get to the second menu on the second disc.

B00006IU73|5.0|Boy, what can I say? If you don't buy this CD you are going to miss one of the true masterpieces of modern rock/progressive music. There is so much here I won't go into it all, but there are shades of everything from King Crimson to Yes (their old progressive jamming style), to Camel, to Steve Hackett, to Pink Floyd, even shades of Atticus Fault!! and yes, to Porcupine Tree too...they do have their own unique sound!! This both rocks and floats through space. I can't say enough about it and I am REALLY looking forward to their new CD due out Sept. 2004!!(followed by an extensive tour!!)<br />I feel like an idiot though, here I am at 49 years old, a long-time music addict and I had never even heard of Porcupine Tree before I stumbled upon this CD by accident...and they've been around for what....14 years or so??? ~=:^0 Oh well, better late than never, now to catch up on all of the rest of what they've accomplished thus far!!<br />Absolutely incredible, time to buy it on DVD-DTS Surround!!!

1881273156|4.0|This book is excellent. However, I dont know that I love the philosophy of putting people in boxes. I think in our society we are trying to pigeon hole everyone and this is one of the ways to do it. Now, if your just looking for ways to understand people and their needs better...or your needs better...this might be the book for you.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much as a child.  In the midst of thinking of movies to add to my wish list, the lightening idea hit me oh yea, the goonies.  I purchased it right away (deciding to pass it along to the new generation)  The Goonies is just as great and funloving as I remember it.  We watch it often and it has become one of my son's favorite movies as well- which we both enjoy!<br />Full of Comedy &amp; Adventure.  Pirate ships, villians, &quot;bootie&quot; traps, &quot;double O negitive&quot; and the &quot;truffle shuffle&quot;  A classic that you will find yourself watching over and over again, laughing at the lines you know are coming.
0792151712|1.0|There are thousands of reasons that this movie deserves to be condemned.  I will list the most obvious and extreme reasons that everyone should despise this movie.<br />First and foremost, the person that said Leo DiCaprio could act needs to have a bucket of VERY icy water dumped over their head.  He is the second worst actor that I have ever seen on screen (the first being Hayden Christiansen).  'Jack Dawson' comes across as an imbecilic, sappy cornball.<br />Also, who exactly decided that Kate Winslet could act?  'Rose' is one of the most melodramatic, annoying, bratty characters that I have ever seen.<br />As if the combination of DiCaprio and Winslet weren't bad enough, the script writer...well, let's put it this way; any person who gives a line about, and I quote 'making lots of babies' to a character that was supposed to be around the age of twenty should not be allowed to write the script for anything, let alone a movie that was supposedly worthy of eleven academy awards.<br />This movie reminds me destinctly of a badly written melodrama, complete with a 'heroine' (read: bratty, rich damsel in distress) a villian who practically ties her to a railroad track, and a hero who heroicly dies saving her.<br />To wrap up this review, I would just like to give anyone reading it six words of advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS CINEMATIC ABOMINATION!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JL96|5.0|I rented lilo and stitch just last friday and I only saw it once before renting it. And it was on disney channel. and I gotta say it's an awesome movie to say the least.  It shows that everyone's different in their own way and that any family can work out together and as long as you got ohana you will never be left behind or forgotton.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Simply put this album is brilliant. There is not a track on this CD that could be considered musically bland, even if it is not to a listener?s tastes. &quot;Silver Girl&quot; is one of the best tracks and &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; has a fascinating blend of guitars that almost sound classical in their use. Stevie Nicks's lyrics are simple poetry while the tracks penned by Lindsey Buckingham are mostly upbeat tracks that remind me of matured &quot;Second Hand News&quot; or &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;. This CD is worth every penny, and as soon as my father notices his copy is missing and I have the cash I will be buying my own.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I considered myself a huge Matrix fan. I watched the first one at least 15 times. Considered it the best movie I ever saw. I could not wait for the sequels to come out. Actually counting down the months until they were out. And boy was I disappointed. Reloaded was passable but Revolutions totally sucked. One of the worst movies I ever saw in my life. I went into this expecting one of the greatest conclusions ever and a great movie also. Both were horrible. The story in the first Matrix was awesome. Well written and did not need the crutch of special effects to carry it. Although the effects were great. Revolutions was a snore fest from the first scene. Way too long fight scenes did not help. You can only get hit so many times with no reaction. I could not wait for them to end. Plus the killed off Trinity. So you know some how this movie was doomed. And yes it was. What do you call that ending. The machines just stop fighting, continue to exist and rely on humans to exist. I thought the idea of the humans rebellion from Zion is to free the people. But apparently the Wachowski saw how many suckers there are and might try to do a 4th movie when the people actually are freed. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. GO rent it. I wanted to like this movie the entire thing sucked. Nothing to like about it.
0330492330|1.0|This book is not really historical. Many reknown historians (not only Belgian, but Britsh and Congolese as well) have concluded that what the book tells is very partial. Yes, they were many victims. Everybody agrees with that. Yes, that was atrocious. But that was the same in any colony (what did the US with the native Indians ?). But you can't call what happened in Congo a genocide. Because this was not programmed. Also, it is practically impossible to precisely know how many people died directly from barbary (and not from disease, wars, etc.). Another example is that the role of Morel is vastly over-estimated in the book. They were others (including Belgians) who reported the atrocities in Congo. Comparing King Leopold to Staline or Hitler is just hilarious, and I would consider that as a selling argument, not a historical truth. How can the author proclaim himself historian ?  I would not recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know better the full story of Congo. It may only lead to wrong conclusions.
B00008PW2D|2.0|This season is not only short (8 episodes) but also it is quite boring.  I love Sarah's character, but in this season is much exaggerated than ever, it seems very desperate, not cool at all, and lacking of the sense of enjoying her life.  No wonder why is she single?.  Any way if you have seen the previous 4 seasons you have to buy it anyway, but keep in mind that it is not close to be as good as the other ones
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Damn, he sounds contented! And who wouldn't be? With successful careers on two fronts (music &amp; film production), millions in the bank, and a beautiful wife &amp; child, George apparently had reached a new level of peace with himself &amp; the world. And it definitely shows on this great disc!<br />&quot;Love Comes To Everyone&quot; is awash with gorgeous chiming guitars and an immaculate vocal performance. From another artist, George's optimistic lyrics might have sounded cloying. From him, they sound absolutely genuine. &quot;Not Guilty&quot; is a defensive jab at the Lennon-McCartney behemoth. Musically, it's light years away from the Beatles Anthology release.<br />&quot;Hear Comes The Moon&quot; is (obviously) a sequel song to a certain Beatles classic. I think I might actually prefer this song to &quot;Hear Comes The Sun.&quot; Definitely one of George's classic tunes. &quot;Soft-Hearted Hana&quot; is the song here with the most Sixties references, both musically and lyrically. Harrison plays some tasty dobro, and the lyrics are George's most surreal.<br />&quot;Blow Away&quot; was a smash over here in the US, and it's the first George song I ever remember hearing on the radio. Starting with a beautiful slide solo, Harrison proceeds with one of his most melodically assured compositions. It's really compulsively infectious.<br />&quot;Faster&quot; is another one of the many breezy, melodic tunes on this album. Brisk acoustic guitars and a joyful Harrison vocal make this most appealing. &quot;Dark Sweet Lady&quot; is a pleasant ballad for Olivia Harrison which features some nice guitar stylings.<br />&quot;Your Love Is Forever&quot; may very well be George Harrison's most beautiful song (though it has a lot of competition). With some of his best singing and his most beguiling melody, this song alone would be worth the price of the CD.<br />&quot;Soft Touch&quot; has some interesting twists and turns. The descending guitar riff is really cool. Of all the tunes, this one reminds me most of the Beatles. &quot;If You Believe&quot; is, unfortunately, marred slightly by a cumbersome melody, but the silky slide guitar work more than makes up for this.<br />The &quot;Moon&quot; demo is interesting, but not much of a revelation. Still, a welcome addition. Of all the remastered Harrison albums to have come out lately, this one has benefited most from improved sound. Hopefully, this eponymous album will find a new audience after all this years.

0385720920|2.0|I really enjoyed Palahniuk's first two books, Fight Club and Survivor. His style and cut throat in-your-face narration keeps you propelled to read on. However, Choke does not do that. I could not even finish the book after getting to page 90. For some reason, the narration got very repetitive and annoying. The content is over-the-top gross, and overshadows the characters and story. Chuck's first two books kept a good balance of satire and the explicit to the development of the main characters. Choke read as though the author was trying to out do his other books by being too ridiculous with repulsive language. By the time you read Choke, Chuck is not so much fun or a shock to read. It's just flat out silly. His latest novels tend to go beyond the repulsive language and try to create a different atmosphere with characters.
0790729369|5.0|After being told time and again that I should at least give this movie a chance, I finally caved.  I now own this movie.  It is beautiful, touching and (as another reviewer stated) probably best watched alone.  I admit I cried.  The performances of both Clint and Meryl are perfection.  I can't imagine anyone else portraying these characters.  Anyone who has ever wondered about the \\"what if\\" factor of love and chemistry will appreciate the story.  <br />With regard to some of the reviews I've read, I have to say that we tend to sometimes miss the point behind a story.  Had the settings been \\"more diverse\\", I believe the intimacy of the story would have been compromised.  The majority of the relationship between these touching characters did, after all, take place in a remote farmhouse.  The Bridges and the County were merely the subtle backdrop.  As for the film portraying adultery as being an act with \\"no consequence\\", I believe the film clearly shows that, regardless of the final decision, there is always consequence.  This is shown both in the minor subplot of the local woman who is scorned by the townspeople and in the reading of the journal.<br />In all, I found this movie very touching and definitely the perfect movie for viewing with a cold martini in front of a warm fire on a rainy night.  Snuggle in and open yourself up to a great love story!
0385504209|1.0|Please don't waste your time with this book. It's just so lame. The characters are barely there--names on a page. The plot is lamer than lame. Embarrassing. Horrifying to see how many people like this book.<br />Read the Name of the Rose if you want to read about Christianity in a fun way. Read anything but this book. The codes are not that hard to figure out except for one that involves another language.<br />The book is totally pseudo-intellectual. I don't understand why people think it's good. Really baffling.
0061015725|3.0|The combination of buying this book for a buck along with hearing good things about Crichton as writer is what lead me to read this book.  The first 220 pages are superb: intriguing character development, good attention to detail, and thought-provoking storyline (also, the description of computer programming techniques which are modeled after different biological systems is utterly fascinating!).  Subsequently, I was expecting a whiz-bang finish; unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed.  About the only way I can characterize the rest of the book is to say that it's \\"over the top.\\"  Rogue nanomachines capable of arranging themselves to take human form?  A symbiotic coupling of nanomachine and human?  I realize this is fiction, but there has to be at least some element of credulity.  If I were the author, I would have explored the possibility of the nanomachines invading and transforming human cells into virulent entities (i.e. - cancer cells).  Or, perhaps I would have delved into the toxic and biological hazards associated with the revolutionary nanomachine production process.  There are many directions this storyline could have taken that would have been much more plausible, in my opinion.  Instead, the reader is left to believe that the nanomachines, which are man-made inventions, become what is, in essence, a completely new life form.  Sorry, that is just a little too hard swallow.

B00005JLMH|5.0|Columbus and the \\"1492\\" saga is a combination of myth and reality; the film is a perfect blend of this, with the events and the persons looking larger than life.  Columbus is shown as a warm blooded sailor, full of the brio that all \\"salts of the sea\\" would have had at the time.  Remember that Columbus was first and foremost a sailor and not an explorer(i.e. Conquistadore) by trade.  The movie does \\"white wash\\" Columbus' role in subjugating the natives(if you listen closely, it is mentioned by the priest during his report to the Crown, but it is not shown on screen.)  Overall, a great epic.
B000000YBQ|5.0|'Waltz for Debby' was one of only four (official) albums made by what Evans fans know as &quot;the first trio&quot; - the one with Scott La Faro and Paul Motian. With 'Sunday at the Village Vanguard' it presents the legendary sessions recorded by the trio at the New York club in June 1961 shortly before La Faro's death in a car accident. Devoted Evans fans would regard both albums as essential. <br />There's a 'complete' Village Vanguard 3-CD set available on the Japanese JVC Victor label. There are also two different CDs which offer selected tracks from the two original albums. In my opinion, the Italian 'Giants of Jazz' version titled 'Waltz for Debby/Village Vanguard' is a better selection than the Milestone label's `Live at the Village Vanguard', but it's difficult to get hold of and I don't know whether the re-mastering will be as good as on the originals. If you don't know either of the original albums and are cautious about investing in the &quot;complete&quot; edition, I would suggest that 'Waltz for Debby' is the one to buy first. (I should add that I know of three other Bill Evans CDs - two of them, confusingly, on the 'Giants of Jazz' label - which use 'Waltz for Debby' in the title. Don't mistake them for this one.) <br />The music itself finds Evans in his more introspective, glowingly lyrical form on the slow pieces: &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, &quot;Detour Ahead&quot;, &quot;Some Other Time&quot; and &quot;I Loves You Porgy&quot;. The first and last of these are especially moving. Evans's delicacy of touch and tone and his willingness to leave space between his phrases (rather than filling the space with unnecessary decoration, as a fussier pianist would) help to give the music a kind of floating, other-worldly quality which Wordsworth's definition of poetry - `emotion recollected in tranquillity' - aptly describes. &quot;My Romance&quot; and Evans's &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot; are similarly romantic, tuneful themes, and although they are faster, more overtly swinging numbers, Evans's improvisations are still in a warmly melodic, 'singing' style. The final track is a fascinating re-working of Miles Davis's famous theme, &quot;Milestones&quot; and, although it's the fastest track on the album, Evans's gentle touch and unhurried phrasing at this tempo give the piece a striking blend of intensity and relaxation. But the album is very much a group performance. The close rapport and the sense of collective improvisation which the trio aimed for are very strong in these Vanguard sessions, and both La Faro and Motian play with remarkable subtlety and insight. <br />One of the immediately noticeable features of these Village Vanguard recordings, when you come upon them for the first time, is the constant 'club' background of chattering, laughing diners, tinkling glasses and cutlery, etc. At least once when you listen to the music you will probably wish that remastering technology could completely remove every extraneous noise and give us the music pure and unsullied. But for some fans (and for drummer Paul Motian, in a New Yorker article recalling the sessions forty years later) the background noise is part of the attraction of the music, locating it in a particular time and place - one Sunday afternoon and evening in 1961 in a New York jazz club - even if, in another sense, the music is utterly timeless. <br />(Adam Gopnik's New Yorker article can be found online at the Bill Evans Web Pages site.)
B00005JM20|1.0|This movie is not worth the time spent to watch it.  If you wish to see why then watch it and you will understand.
B0000TB050|5.0|It is the most powerful collection from U2 ever.....
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Revolutions is a lot like Reloaded (or re-hashed as I call it).  Doesn't really do anything for the story but take time and have filler.<br />If you love the Matrix and haven't seen Reloaded or Revolutions yet, DON'T watch them.  They ruin everything.<br />MOVIE SPOILERS AHEAD...<br />The end of the Trilogy isn't the end of the story.  Neo disappears in the end.  We don't see him die.  We don't see him live.  He's just taken away.<br />The machines they are fighting aren't destroyed, they just pack up and leave. <br />The gatekeeper or keymaster or master programmer or whoever the hell he is still wants a war and is still alive at the end.<br />After the original Matrix, it took 2 friggin movies to kill Agent Smith.  What a waste of time and money.  Nothing else was accomplished.  Oh wait, it did give them 4 hours to show off special effects.  Sorry...<br />Now they're going to wait until DVD sales die then release a box set with EXTRA special editions which will be nothing more but the current DVD's plus an added documentary or two and maybe some interviews.  <br />I wish I hadn't seen (and bought) the last 2 movies in the series.  It ruined the coolness and freshness of the original.
B00008DDXC|4.0|You have to remember that the Harry Potter books are excelent and that you can not expect the movie to be better than the books.  However i was plesantly suprised when I saw the Chamber of secrets.  I remember reading this book and being kind of bored.  I mean It was my least favorite of the books.  This movie did a great job but I kindof thought that Voldemort tords the end could have been meaner if you know what I mean.  If I were to rate the books I would say 1st Goblet, Azcaban, 3rd Order, 4th Stone, 5th Chamber.  The Chamber was better than the 1st one is some aspects.
B000002C1V|5.0|Roger Waters' (ahem, Pink Floyd's) The Final Cut is an album that's much quieter than other albums--it may seem as if a lot of the album just has Roger Waters talking, but there is music in the background, and while soft, it's excellent! All of the songs are much more acoustic, like Wish You Were Here or Is There Anybody Out There, and Roger Waters' voice fits perfectly with the music-- melancholy and crisp as a winter breeze.  It's almost a lullaby at times...<BR>And in others, Pink Floyd at their rockin' best! In a sense, The Final Cut is Roger Waters' epitome, even more so than The Wall. Feeling bitter, feeling down, feeling OUTRAGED? Chances are, you've identified with Roger Waters at some point in other Pink Floyd albums, and The Final Cut is the best expression of Roger Waters, I think, except with an obvious anti-war twist. So, the songs:<BR>1. the post war dream - a good song, like a lot of the other songs, which simply has Waters' voice in the foreground. If you strain your ears, great acoustic guitar<BR>2. your possible pasts - most of these songs sound like filler, but all of them have some intricate guitar or sound effect that makes them really worthwhile--you can sort of hear it on the samples...<BR>3. one of the few - same thing<BR>4. the hero's return - really great effects, full of anger--when Waters' voice squeals up into a scream (a familiar sound, right?) it's like catharsis. Sorry to focus on Waters and his voice so much, but it's the bulk of the music on this album...<BR>5. the gunners' dream- very nice, sad, song with saxophones and desolate anti-war beauty. Beauty as in the ever-haunting and ever-excellent lyrics go with comfortably-numb-with-saxophones-caliber music.<BR>6. paranoid eyes-  even though there may not be much music here, it still has a rhythmn that will have you whispering with strained vocal chords, &quot;and you can hide, hide, hide.....behind paranoid eyes&quot;<BR>...filler songs that suck, although the flecther memorial homehas a nice solo, if you can survive through the first part of the song<BR>7.southampton dock - beautiful lyrics, and that's something to be said for the album as a whole: if there was more music (perhaps this would have been the rest of the band's influence?) all of the songs would blow away everything else the band ever did.<BR>10. the final cut- lyrics! Music! At long last! The highlight of the album has more sadness in it than Comfortably Numb, and in some ways is a sequel: &quot;dial the combination open the priesthole, and if i'm in, i'll tell you what's behind the wall&quot;.  This song is incredibly depressing; it deals poignantly with suicide, which sharpens it compared to Comfortably Numb.  THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY SAD SONG I'VE EVER HEARD (capitals make it sound more true) but it really really is.  Maybe it's worth the price of the entire album. At the time of certain feelings, I suppose...&quot;thought i oughta bear my naked feelings, thought i oughta tear the curtain down...i held the blade in trembling hands, prepared to make it but just then the phone rang/i never had the nerve to make the final cut&quot; Another meaning to the album name is quite intriguing.<BR>11. Not Now John - the best song to be after the final cut! f*** you, emo! (it seems to be saying, anyways) Goes from depression to beyond depression. This would be utter despair with a wrathful &quot;i don't give a s*** anymore!&quot; Probably my favorite song on The Final Cut (the final cut doesn't count because they're so different. For different times of the day!)<BR>12. two suns in the sunset - it's nice, still good music instead of just voices, but who really cares after those two great songs? Gets a little creepy towards the end, which makes it hard to play, but the melody is very poignant.<BR>So, to finish, you should definitely look at the album because of the final cut and not now john...and to tell the truth, by the end you wish the album wasn't only 43 something minutes. Because &quot;worst Pink Floyd album&quot;, &quot;roger waters solo album&quot; notwithstanding, it's haunting, beautiful, wrathful, rockin--which is what we expect from Pink Floyd in the first place.  Pink Floyd isn't Pink Floyd without emotion, and this album is all emotion--music occasionally taking the second seat. ONE OF THEIR BEST.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I was going to protest seeing this movie for I did not want my cherished images of the books be over written by some wanna be movie.  Trust me it was not like that.  It was perfect.  I mean I gave It FIVE STARS!
B00005N9CV|3.0|I would have given this cd 3 and a half stars.This is a very good song. Although some of the songs are long and do drag sometimes (BESAME MUCHO) many of them are excellent. The stand out songs are I REMEMBER YOU (the best in the album) and THE LOOK OF LOVE. This CD is good value although their could of been some room for improvment. If you do not like smooth jazz or slow music do not buy this CD! If u are a jazz fan or even a classical fan be sure you do buy this CD. Great vocal and orchestral arrangments make this CD even better. All in all this is a great CD for any smooth jazz fan or classical fan.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Wow this movie was bad.  It was boring, the script was lame, the acting was bad, and I did not even see the plot for I was too busy sleeping!  I love star wars but this movie did not even have to come out.  They released this movie for a smaller audiance but Im sure they did not like It because it was soooo boring!  Episode 2 should have been the first one.  The fact that Anikan is like 10 and Padme like 17 is a little creepy considering they marry in episode 2.  Wow that was bad!  Thank god for DVDs.
B00008NV4I|5.0|From beginning to end, the plot grips you into the real world of Star Trek.  This movie was Star Trek at its best.  It is sad that so many Star Trek fans feel that is wasn't that great, but when you consider the action, plot, special effects and great acting, it becomes clear how good this movie really is.  And again, the special effects and just incredible; how the Enterprise-E crashes (not a spoiler since it was in the trailers) in Semitar is absolutely breathtaking.  Everything just looked so real.  It is too bad that Paramount decided to take out nearly 45 minutes of the movie since I think they would have added greatly to the overall appeal of the movie.  Star Trek fans or not, this is a great sci-fi movie and is worth the watch (actually, I have watched it more than 12 times since it came out on DVD).
B000059Z8M|5.0|This movie is either just as good as the 1st movie or even better.  More characters, More laughs, more TOY STORY MOVIES PLEASE!
074325144X|5.0|I started running to get in shape about six months ago.  I have struggled with many reoccuring knee troubles, hip troubles, etc.  After reading this book I immediately felt a difference in my knee pain on my first run.  Just as an experiment I went back and forth from ChiRunning to my &quot;normal&quot; running style.  I could immediately tell a difference in the joint pain and effort levels.  Following my 3 mile run, I had virtually no joint pain or muscle tightness or soreness.  I highly recommend this book.  I is easy to read, with good exercises and examples that make it quite easy to understand.

6304286961|4.0|This is a visual spectacular and the music is<BR>very good as well. Although the movie concentrates<BR>on Jim's bad habits, it comes across as mainly<BR>positive -- Jim is the good antihero. The psyche-<BR>delic stream-of-consciousness imagery is<BR>outstanding and the soundtrack is excellent, <BR>except, well...<BR> Oliver Stone is wonderful with capturing the<BR>optical qualities of the mind-expanding experience.<BR>He auditioned Val Kilmer for the vocal parts and,<BR>according to legend, couldn't tell the difference<BR>between Jim's and Val's vocal styles.

0553573403|5.0|If you're wondering about starting a fantasy series, look no further!  This book has it all; swordplay, romance, honor, duty, mythology, magic, the supernatural, and something that ties it all together...skepticism.  Let me explain:  Nothing is taken for face value within this book.  All magic is doubted.  All otherworldly happenings are dismissed by so many of the characters, although the reader knows of the possibility of their truth.<br />  The greatness of this book and this series is the ability to show so many sides of one story.  It's like watching an aerial view of a great chess match, and not knowing which side to pull for.  And trust me...it only gets better!
0385504209|5.0|Look, to all the bloody Christians out there, I say STOP WHINGING and pretending to be so devout by being offended by this book! What would be so bad about Jesus being married anyway? Mohammed was married, you know! And what's more, this book shows up just how arrogant and bigoted Christianity is because it focusses on the man and the male. What's so wrong about female divinity anyway? Dan makes a very good point, amongst many others, that the bible was written by humans, and what's more MALE humans. Of course it is going to reflect the interests of the church and the power it weilded over people! Develop a thicker skin or just pretend that the book doesn't exist if you want to bury your heads in the sand and hide from the truth!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Despite what many fans think and what you may have heard, The Matrix Revolutions; the third and final (?) film in the Matrix trilogy sends the series off with a bang as opposed to the whimper that many expected.  First off, Revolutions is much better and more satisfying than Matrix Reloaded, and the CGI effects are better as well.  Picking up right where Reloaded left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped between the real world and the artificial world of the Matrix while the war between man and machine rages on both fronts as the people of Zion defend the city against the endless swarms of sentinels and the multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) grows more powerful in the world of the Matrix.  There aren't as many jaw dropping action scenes (until the film's climax) that populated the previous two films, but the battle for Zion and the ultra epic Super Burly Brawl in which Neo and Smith fight for the final time are marvels of modern movie magic.  As a whole however, just like Reloaded, Revolutions just can't live up to the awe of the original film.  And as much as I like the two later entries of the series, I can't help but think that there never should have been a Matrix trilogy.  When we saw Neo fly towards the sky at the end of the first film, that should have been it, but naturally Warner Bros. knows how to milk a good thing dry.  The DVD itself is much better on features than the disappointing Reloaded two disc set; with featurettes that are actually worth watching.  However, there is yet again no commentary at all.  I guess co-directors/writers Andy and Larry Wachowski are too busy counting their money.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on television, and it's DVD release is long overdue. The show is well written, well acted, and it takes a matter of seconds before you're engrossed in the story line. The show has been exceptional since the pilot, and has continued to please. The first season introduces us to Stars Hollow, Chilton, and Hartford. We meet the kooky residents of the Gilmore's hometown, the spoiled Chiltonites, and Richard and Emily Gilmore, Lorelai's parents who could be her polar opposites. Many of these characters are still important today. Sookie, Luke, Paris, Miss Patty, etc... Plus, we meet Tristan DuGrey. What more could a girl ask for?
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I do not believe that I have EVER watched an animated film that taught more of the values that I would want future generations to learn from than MULAN.  I have watched this movie at LEAST 25 times and simply put - it is PROFOUND.<br /><br />The movie opens with Mulan getting ready to go to the \\"Matchmaker.\\"  Although, she is a beautiful girl, she lacks the grace to make a good impression.  Devistated, she returns home. Her father tells her that \\"like the cherry blossoms, her season has not come.\\"<br /><br />When China is invaded by the Huns, there is one line in the movie that is uttered by the emperor and it is SO insightful. The general in charge of the armies confidently announces that his men can handle this invasion.  However, the emperor issues a proclamation calling all available men because, \\"sometimes a single grain of rice may be the deciding balance in tipping the scales.\\"  Or - \\"one man may make a difference between conquest and defeat.\\"<br /><br />In this case, it turns out to be a woman!  I LOVE how Mulan interacts horribly with the men at first and how she is told to leave.  Mulan has to prove herself and she doesn't give up.<br /><br />Even after she is a hero, Mulan is disgraced when it is discovered that she is a woman.  She is shunned and yet when she must come to the rescue of China again, her comrades are loyal to her and listen to her ideas.<br /><br />Throughout the movie there are the different interactions of those who accept women for who they are and those who are stuck within stereotypes.<br /><br />Mulan is a cute and VERY funny movie with adorable songs.  What makes it a GREAT movie however, is the very powerful message that we should judge one another on our merits and character - whether we be men or women.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|Revolutions was as amazing as ever, music and action, SFX and all.  Especially the intensities of the battles and scenes. Jam packed with intense action weather it was bullet time or not i couldnt help but feel like i was part of it.  :-) I absolutly love the sound tracks pale 3, juno reactor vrs rob dougan. This movie will never be forgotten in the hearts and minds of fans everywhere and as for hell boy..please..that movie was no where near the original break through matrix. It was rather pathetic. Anyway the matrix trilogy will continue to rock on you put your hearts and souls and energy into it and you know it will continue . Rock on wachowski brothers and freinds!
B000069HZP|5.0|&quot;The Game&quot; is Michael Douglas at his finest in his portrayal as a Type A workaholic at the top of his game.<br />His somewhat underachieving brother, portrayed by Sean Penn, gives Douglas a birthday gift in the form of a &quot;game&quot; where reality takes a dive and Douglas' life goes into a spin. Although there were a few areas that were a little hard to follow - the premise of this reality game is so imaginative and real.  It is only when Douglas hits rock bottom that he realizes how isolated from the real world he has become and what is truly important in life.<br />I thought this movie was insightful and masterful.  I watch it frequently and it always delivers a powerful message.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I shied away from seeing this movie after I read a description of what it was about. Then I read some rave reviews and overcame my initial trepidation. I know that James Spader, one of my favorite actors, often chooses odd vehicles to showcase his talents, so I decided to give the movie a chance.<br />I am glad that I did because it was well worth viewing, in my opinion. Strange? yes. Disturbing? yes. Pornographic? no. It is a funny and oddly tender movie...a different kind of love story. But because it is different, is it wrong? I don't think so.<br />There is a lot of emotional pain in this movie, shown brilliantly by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, Lee (just out of a mental hospital), who goes to work for the emotionally closed-off lawyer, E. Edward Grey (Spader), a man with many fetishes, obviously an odd duck. Before long, Lee has become the object of one of these fetishes...and she finds herself excited more than she has ever been.<br />These odd and needy characters are presented as sympathetic and we come to care about them as the movie unfolds. They establish a slowly built, fragile relationship that we may not understand, but the filmmaker does, and he portrays it in a sensitive and caring manner.
0790733226|5.0|This was an absolutely GREAT movie to watch with the home theatre system!  My God, I could literally FEEL the vibrations of the ignition systems as the space rocket started to take off!<br />Jodie Foster is great as always in this terrific Sci-Fi thriller. I especially like how she captured the uncertainty, but resolve as she heads toward the unknown.<br />If only to get a rush from the great sound effects, this movie is a winner!
B00000AFFF|2.0|because I can tell that the performances are pretty good, and a lot of work went into it.  But, the tunes are downright dog-wailing-at-night awful, sorry to say.  Let me also say that I'm not afraid of some sappy songs.  Burt Bacharach has made some really nice tuneful songs in his day, as has Costello.  What they've done here is nothing short of astonishing, but not in the positive sense.<br />I fully expected something along the lines of Costello's version of &quot;I'll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;.  But what this CD provides you with is dentist office music.  My secretary laughed out loud when she heard me trying to make it through this CD in my office.<br />Word to the wise.  If you love feeling like you're about to get your teeth worked on, this is the CD for you.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|The capacity for creating good melody is rare. But when you find it right along side with clever bass lines, dynamic harmony, intelligent lyrics, and a killer beat, it's gold. I think Pitchfork's 9.1 agrees with me.<br />Comparisons to the Strokes, the White Stripes and other indie bands are appropriate. I venture even further to say that they seem inspired by many great off-the-beaten-path rock bands over the last quarter century. The parallels between this and the Talking Heads' album, More Songs About Buildings And Food, for instance are striking.<br />Regardless of who they might remind you of, however, Franz Ferdinand is undeniably original and may very well end up the reigning king of Britpop that Blur and the Strangles never quite were. I don't regret a single dime I spent on their first CD, nor do I skip any of the tracks therein. Speculation abound as to whether or not these guys are one-hit wonders, so get 'em while they're hot.
B000002KD9|5.0|Before I start my review on this classic album I should point out that 2 of the 11 songs are little minute-long filler tracks, one is a cover of an old country song, and one is a hard rocking track about DANCING.  DANCING!  On a Neil Young record!  Maybe I miss the hidden irony, but to me it just sounds ridiculous when Neil sings lines such as \\"When you dance, oh, oh I can really love!\\"  But don't worry about any of that, because the rest of the songs on After the Gold Rush are some of the most heartbreaking, affecting and poignant songs ever put to tape.  Beautiful harmonies, restrained acoustic arrangements and moving lyrics are this album's bread and butter.  <br /> This writing of this album was supposedly influenced by a Dean Stockwell screenplay called, believe it or not, \\"After the Gold Rush\\"; I find that hard to believe considering the highly personal nature of this album.  The theme seems to be falling OUT of love, and the introspection/self discovery/guilt that goes along with it.  Songs like \\"Birds\\" and \\"I Believe in You\\" have to be the most eloquently written and emotional songs of dismissal I can think of.  There are a few exceptions, however, most notably the bitter attack on southern bigotry that is \\"Southern Man\\".  It features some of that manic Crazy Horse guitarwork and positively SEARING lyrics.  \\"Now your crosses are burning fast\\", \\"I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking\\"!  Brutal.  At this point I should probably mention that the aforementioned song fragments and dance numbers aren't bad in any way, shape, or form.  They're actually welcome respite from the heavy emotional tone of the rest of the numbers.  And the fine, fine melodies are ALWAYS present (although the sequencing is a little off; case in point:  placing \\"When You Dance\\" between the two most heartbreaking songs on the album).  If I was forced at gunpoint to pick highlights, they would have to be \\"Tell Me Why\\", the title track, \\"Southern Man\\" and \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down\\" and \\"Birds\\".  But in reality, this album is best experienced as a cohesive unit; it ebbs and flows with no rough spots. <BR> <BR> After the Gold Rush should be owned by anyone with an appreciation for restrained, emotional, melodic, beautiful music.  Which encompasses pretty much everyone.  Unless you're a masochist or a metal fan.  If not, don't hesitate to experience this album, I can guarantee you there won't be any regrets.
B000084T18|1.0|This has got to be the biggest pile of trash I've ever heard. I bought this album because of all the hype surrounding it, and because of the fact that Eminem is my favorite rapper and he signed 50. Big mistake. The album is full of uninspired beats, no emotion or humor, no innovation, and its repetetive and dull. You can hear it in 50's slurred voice, he stumbles on simple rhymes that he can't bust (no pun intended...). And that new G-Unit project he's doing is no better. Watching his &quot;Stunt 101&quot; video on MTV, its obvious that he's going the wrong way. He releases a debut album, it sells millions based off hype, and then watch: his next album he's bragging about his cars, money, and ho's (in Beg For Mercy). Try some good rap like Eminem or Outkast.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Great movie just watched it last night.  Can't wait for X3
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Halle Berry stars in an average thriller that might have faired better as an episode from \\"Tales From The Darkside\\", than a stand alone film.<br />  Berry stars as a psychatrist who becomes a patient in her own institution after she is accused of killing her husband, an act she can't recall. Things change to the bizarre when she actually starts to have nightmares of the event, and paranormal occurences start to take its toll on her mind. The questions is: Did she lose her mind & really kill her husband or is it something different entirely?<br />  The film does have some impressive twists and turns. But, once the pieces come together, you can figure out what's going on and the last quarter of the film is a by the numbers conclusion with and above average ending that might lead to a sequel. A good movie, but, not as scary as it is intended to be. The DVD has very little special features (a trailer, a below average music video, and film commentary). Rental only.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Great combo, Buble is showcased both on audio and video! He's a remarkable singer with star quality and the dvd portion shows us that. The cd is refreshing, live performance allows for that extra pizzaz! The rendition of My Funny Valentine touched my soul and seeing him sing it to a huge crowd - without the benefit of a microphone is simply amazing. Really enjoyable package - this CD/DVD combo is 5 Stars good!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The &quot;Matrix&quot; saga chugs along in this unsatisfying second entry that is devoid of humor and is basically a major ripoff of other sci-fi films (&quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;).<br />  The war between man and machine heats up as Neo and his band of humans prepare for the worst. Meanwhile, Agent Smith disconnects himself from the Matrix to become a rogue virus and starts to cause trouble for both the Matrix and Neo.<br />  The &quot;Matrix&quot; films are like a bad hip-hop cd - all style and bling bling, but, no substance and soul. I went into this film without much hope (the first film was o.k. at best). The acting is stilted (Are we supposed to care for any of these characters? The performances in &quot;Star Wars Episode II&quot; were better, compared to this). Fishburne's, Zion speech is a howler (he looks gross with his shirt off) and the dance afterwards is embarassing to watch. Jada Pinkett Smith has enough black attitude to power &quot;Bad Boys III&quot; without having Will Smith or Martin Lawerence showing up. Keanu Reeves continues to strive to be the world's suckiest actor. The highway chase went on far too long (how many times does Morpheius need to hang off the side of the truck...lame!). The Keymaster in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is a lot better than the one here. The color scheme to the film is green and black, much like the darkside of a shamrock shake. After over 2 hours spent of my life watching this, it still ain't over. For the people who haven't seen this, skip it, because, I can hear the fatlady starting to sing on this trilogy.
0812548094|4.0|I just had to write about this book. Well, it's not about the book per se, which by the way I thouroughly enjoyed. I read the reviews of others but rarely do I base my opinion on what they say.  I enjoyed this book immensely and will be running out to get the third on very soon!!<br />Now for my gripe:  Who is this guys flipping editor?  With the first book, there were stupid errors in grammar and sentences that had the wrong words in them, things spelled wrong and just not making sense. In this one, I  find the lack of punctuation to be very disconcerting.  It is annoying as I am reading to come to what should be the end of a sentence, but because it lacks the appropriate punctuation, not knowing it is the end and having the entire sentence make no sense to me.<br />While this book also has a few grammatical and spelling errors, I find the lack of punctuation to be appaling. <BR>How the \\"editor\\" missed these things is beyond me!<br />Mr. Goodkind, if you read this, e-mail me! I will happily become your editor!!!!  :-)
0380807343|5.0|coraline is indeed a wickedly clever little tale. it's not a lenghty work, suitable for the market it targets. many parents think that coraline is pretty scary for their kids, but i think not excessively so. in fact, it's not a story meant to scare the pants of children, but one that teaches them to face their fears rationally, and even develop a healthy sense of respect for it.    coraline is a girl who just moved in to an old, rambling house that was converted into apartments. bored senseless, she began exploring the surroundings, and was introduced to the various off-beat characters that live there. these things she can handle, but what about the place beyond the locked door in her apartment?    as most of gaiman's work, the world of coraline is both real and surreal. he made it possible for readers to emphatize with coraline, and portrayed the child-parent relationship with finesse and insight. most importantly, he shows adults how perceptive and resourceful children can be, and shows children that parents aren't necessarily indifferent towards their kids.    as an adult, i find the book enchanting and peppered with delicious ironies. this is a work that can be enjoyed on many levels; children will enjoy the tale of how the heroine react in the face of adversity, while adults will perhaps find the inner child they lost.    delightful.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|That was all I could think of while watching the last hour of this goddamn awful movie. That and wow how will Goku get out of this one. I bet Frieza oops Agent Smith isn't really dead yet. Oh, and the DVD may have some neato features but I refuse to pay any more money to find out what they are.
0061020710|5.0|I've been introduced to the Discworld, and I think I'm going to enjoy it. It was a really hard book to put down, but that's not much of a problem with a 200 page book. Funny, imaginative, and fun would describe this book best. I look forward to reading the rest! My only gripe is that it's hard to spend $6.99 for each book since they are digested so quickly...but hey, it's worth it.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Thoroughly a treasure; really, it's swell, just swell.  Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, and Carol channing are terrific in this fun spoof of the 1920's.  Julie Andrews is Millie, and is as enduring and talented as ever.  Mary Tyler Moore is so sweet in this film, and has a chance to show off her amazing dancing talent.  Adding to the supreme talent of these actress is the insanely brillant Beatrice Lilly as Mrs. Meers, the villianess, who quips us with great lines such as &quot;Shoe Show,&quot; or &quot;Sad to be all alone in this world.&quot;  Balancing off the female talents in this film are the delightful and funny James Fox, and the oh so swell John Gavin.<BR>The film is fabulous, fun and delightful, holding many highlight musical scenes such as dancing in the elevator, Jazz Baby, or the tapioca, or even other, non musical scenes such as scenes with the cab driver.  It is a film to be enjoyed simply because of how much fun it is.  And it'll have you quoting it, or singing the songs from it for months afterward. <BR>Don't miss this film by jingo- no raspberries!
B000002G8J|5.0|This has become one of my favorite albums.  As was the case with many of Eric Clapton's 70s recordings, there is conscious, post-traumatic sense of escape from the trappings of superstardom.  &quot;Backless&quot; is the antithesis of the apocalyptic drama that was Cream or Derek and the Dominos.  No one would ever die for this music--it's just for fun, to make you smile, and to enjoy some great playing.  His two Dylan songs are nothing you would confuse with &quot;Desolation Row&quot;--they are simple songs that could've been written by anybody, and they are both quite enjoyable here.  The real highlights, though, are the minor hits &quot;Promises,&quot; &quot;Watch out for Lucy,&quot; and &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; which have a great after-hours motel room feel about them.  &quot;Promises&quot; is as close to perfection as you could get--a subdued vocal, lyrics ruminating about one of those relationships that get under your skin, a great rhythm track, and subtle slide guitar touches that double the wordless chorus.  &quot;Watch out for Lucy&quot; is an irresistable toe-tapper that allows Clapton to cut loose on the guitar, and &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; is a rocker that provides another good setting for Clapton to cut loose. I love the organist and the drummer on this session--and found myself thinking of Garth Hudson and Levon Helm.
0684857820|4.0|I never finished this book to be honest... it felt like I was prying and spying on Alice. It felt like it was none of my business to know what kind of hell she went through... I honestly felt guilty reading it but I admit it did touch me in a way and made me a little more self conscience of what is going on in the world and how girls- women, young and old, need to know how to defend themselves or know what to do if ever faced with a situation such as her's...<BR>I recomend you read The Lovely Bones... it comforts me knowing it's a fiction... Alice Sebold is truly a brave woman for sharing her story with the world.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that I have ever bought!! <br />If you like SRV, you will fall in love with Joe.
6304675348|3.0|The very first time i saw this film i would of rated it 5 stars, but after watching it a couple of times it as got really boring. It isn't really scary, but gory. I like watching this film but not as much as i used to do. Its based on a serial killer but i won't tell you who, who is phoning people for a game and killing them. Then he or them is after someone else. But one person manages to get away each time. GORY,TERROR AND HALF SCARY.
B00006879E|5.0|its very rare to buy a cd and love every single song on it.  i think its only happened to me twice in my life.  and now for a third time with maroon five's songs about jane.  after i saw them open for john mayer back in august of 2003 i immediately had to have the cd.  since then i have not stopped listening to it and i never get tired of it.  i love it.  everyone should go out nad buy a copy or two!
B00003CX8I|5.0|If you like action and power this is your type. I wanted it for ages, but never reading the reviews about it,but i could tell on the box what it was about. I have never been one for these films, but this is brill! x men i have wanted for ages well x men 2, and i had never seen the 1st and without seing the 1st the second probably carries on. I really enjoyed it, but from the beggining to the middle was the best, although normally the end gets better. I can't wait to see the 2nd and anyone who likes a film with abit of action and powers, will defently like this film, im sure of it.
0783225881|5.0|This is an intriguing movie for any baseball fan, yet the story is so much deeper than that of bringing back baseball players to life who had their dreams stripped from them for whatever reason.<br />However, Ray Cancella, played by Costner really has a desire to see his dad who died when he was young.  Ray's dad wanted to play baseball very badly and his life was different because he did not.<br />I had an uncle who tried out for a pro team just prior to WWII, he did not make the team and this movie makes me wonder what his life would have been like had he made the grade.<br />James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster in the flick made it memorable.  The movie is really about choices and what you do with your life if your dreams do not happen.  I think it is a watcher each baseball season.  I watch it almost every year as a season opener.
B000002N1E|5.0|A FANTASTIC Experience indeed! This is one of Prince's best albums ever, even if it's been somewhat overlooked and underated.  I highly recommend this CD to any and all Prince fans.  It may be a bit explicit for some.. and for small children... but those who know and love Prince can expect him at his best on this one.  ;o)
B00003W8NM|5.0|A movie hard to swallow by many movie-goers, even the best and the brightest adults I know cannot fully incorporate this movie into thier minds, understandable. I have been explicitly interest in movies for as long as i can remember, i am only sixteen years old and i saw this move about two years ago, i liked it when i first saw it because i recognized the excellent direction and outstanding acting from Norton, Pitt, an Carter, i was also interested in its dark style and excellent writing (so much i read the book right after seeing it) however after many viewings in the last year i have come to a more insightful appreciation of this movie and it has become one of my favorite movies.<BR>   The very beggining of the movie is a honest sight on the flaws of modern corporate society. I have always had a removed feeling from society so this immediately spoke to me. it then progresses into a sight on male bonding and masculinity through violence. this is a part of the movie that many object to for its explicit scenes of men beating the CRAP out of each other. however most guys will jump all over this because it's &quot;cool&quot; regardless of it's meaning. it meaning is the raw testoserone power that some people have trouble controlling, this results in silly squabbles and spiralling toward unreasonable violence, so this violence presented in the movie appeals to men in a way mainly misunderstood by women, but is also presented in a sarcastic, dark-humored context. However its ability to give the men involved a strange type of solace with thier life also speaks clearly. As this man conflicted with different lifestyles begins to lose the life he knew he meetes a friend named &quot;Tyler Durden&quot; who has a simplistic male nihilistic view of the world that he present to the main character in a positive light.<BR>   Now the movie moves into yet another stage that for most people seems to miss the point of the movie completely and is definitely the most difficult to understand, a psycological twist in the mind of the main charcter leaves him questioning everything that has happened to him in the past stage of his life. This at first glance seems to be a selling &quot;plot twist&quot; with no meaning but &quot;BOX OFFICE&quot;. however this allows a second viewing time to digest everything in an entirely different light not only in plot but in meaning as well. This puts the Modern Nihilistic view in a more balanced light. All in all this gives an objective view of nihilism and allows men to have a chooice in what kind of life they want to lead and how they want to control it.<BR>  Now, what about women? This movie is pretty much intended for a male audience, however the character of Marla Singer show the role that women play in this aspect of men's life, it also allows a stab at how we view women and that we should try to take them much more seriously. however she is the spark that sets off the entropy of a spiral toward destruction.<BR>   Throughout the movie are small nuances that would take a long time to explain each one, however this shows that alot of thought and interest was put into this movie, and after many viewings im not sure i get every point this movie tries to make. <BR>   It is alot to swallow in 140 minutes and take many viewings to take it in entirely, therefore i recommend a second viewing if you thing you really didn't quite &quot;get it&quot;. but of course what do i know and what credibility do i have. I'm only 16.
0783225881|2.0|Not so long ago Ben Mankiewicz, scion of the screenwriting/producing/directing family, told a great story on television: the first time he saw the 1989 &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; he was bawling in the movie theatre, that's how impressed he was. Ben's relationship with his father (Joseph's nephew) had always been close, and a great deal of their bonding had been associated with baseball. They had been going to games together since Ben was a kid. Therefore, as soon as Ben left the theatre, he called his father and gushed: &quot;Dad, I've just seen 'Field of Dreams'!&quot; Before he could go any further, the elder man growled: &quot;Wasn't that the dumbest piece of crap you ever saw?&quot; Poor Ben doesn't seem like a wimp, but he was so crushed by his father's reaction he had no choice but to agree. Having finally seen this fanatically idolized movie I can only say: &quot;Bravo, Mankiewicz pre!&quot; This is beer-sappy bilge, the type of thing Homer Simpson would sob over at Moe's. I can't imagine a baseball fan enjoying this movie, any more than I can imagine anyone who really likes children sitting through a program with that obnoxious dinosaur. Written and directed with sledge-hammer simplicity by Phil Alden Robinson (who hasn't done much since), &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is the story of Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer by way of Berkeley who, one afternoon in his cornfield, hears a voice: &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot; That's it, but Kinsella decides &quot;it&quot; is a baseball field, so he plows under his corn and constructs a diamond, complete with lights. Kinsella's convinced the &quot;he&quot; of the cryptic message is none other than Shoeless Joe Jackson, the player who, with seven of his team mates, was indicted in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal; but Kinsella is further convinced that Jackson was railroaded, an honest man who made a mistake. (Actually, Robinson's screenplay implies that Jackson was completely innocent -- citing his batting average as proof!) Kevin Costner had already established himself as a star of Cooperesque sincerity. Unfortunately, he got the goofy charm down pat but not the rugged individualism. Amy Madigan, as Kinsella's wife, is more difficult to judge. I think her character was meant to be a hybrid of Berkeley liberalism and mid-West spunk, but what comes across is somewhat shallow. (Following &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, Ms Madigan did a great deal of TV.)That patriarchal character actor James Earl Jones wastes his sepulchral voice on some pretty contrived dialogue; and, even sadder, Burt Lancaster makes one of his last screen appearances in an awkward scene involving a little girl's very unconvincing crisis. Robinson and Costner, before committing themselves to a baseball fantasy about a man fighting pragmatic odds, should have studied Clarence Brown's light but spiky &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;. Between &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Angels&quot;, I'll bet the Mankiewicz elders would have preferred the latter.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Well what can I say.  The consept I guess is good, definatly original.  But...  What about the characters from the second movie, the two ghost dudes, and who is the guy that runs the subway train to the &quot;Place in the middle&quot; of the matrix and the real world.  Neo is not even around for most of the movie, then he gets his eyes fried, but of course he can still see.  The battle for Zion is cool, it is what makes the movie worth watching.  But as for story development, it sucks.  I thought they would explain more of how Neo got his powers, I mean they basicaly make him a God.  I guess I expected much more from a franchise boasting as much as the Matrix trilogy has.  It seems as if nothing from the second movie even made it to the third.  Maybe they should have made four movies.  Bottom line is its worth watching to finish off the trilogy, but not near as good as the potential that the franchise started of with.  The first Matrix is still the best.
B00004XOWM|2.0|This CD is extremely disapointing.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because Wes is still great.<BR>Here is my personal opinion on a few of the songs:<br />Hot Dog: This song is completely immature!  All Fred Durst does is say &quot;f*ck&quot; over 45 times.  An excrept: &quot;It's a f*cked up world, it's a f*cked up place, everybody's judged by their f*cked up face...&quot;  And that's pretty much it for 3 minutes and 50 seconds.<br />Full Nelson: Another ridiculous song.  Fred finally realizes what a loser he is (&quot;Why's everybody always picking one me?&quot; he whines.)  He then quickly becomes aggressive and boasts that he could beat anyone up.<br />Rollin' (air raid vehicle): The only word that pops into my mind is...EMBARRASSING!  First Fred Durst repeats &quot;Rollin', rollin', rollin',&quot; about ten times.  Then he says proudly &quot;You can't mess with Limp Bizkit!&quot;  <br />Save your money, folks!
B00009Z574|4.0|i learned to know YES in the abwh&amp;union-phase in the late80`s&amp;early 90`s when i was about 15 years old. THANK GOD! this way i had the opportunity to challenge the yes catalogue backwards, and without predjuce.tormato is a great album, and it IS a PROGRESS compared to the four(great in its time)older albums:yes went back writing 4-6minute SONGS.indeed,prog rock WAS dead at the time, but YES kept their own style, added with more electronics. actually the tormato follow-up album whith became DRAMA would also have been great with the tormato line-up(there are a few songs as bonus tracks on the drama remaster cd).
0790729725|5.0|Thats why after reading through many of the one-two star reviews I had to weigh in with my two cents. <BR> Right off the bat, this is one of the greatest films ever produced. Godfather still rates as my all time greatest American film. But this isnt the Godfather, this is the real story of a real gangster, in a real mob family. The Luchesse family to be exact. And it is not a tragic opera with universal themes with which we can all identify. These are hardcore criminals who live a life most of us would never want and probably have little contact with. <BR>  So for people who said they couldnt identify with the characters, your not alone. <BR>  Another complaint I read alot is the use of language. More specificly the dreaded F*** word. One reviewer even took the view of my middle class father (whom I love very much) and said &quot;Even gangsters back then didnt talk like that..&quot;<BR>   Well how many gangsters did you hang out with back them days? From much of what I'v read that word has been in use going back to the 1800s and beyond. I understand that to some it and other words are offensive, but that is why we have a rating system. But like it or not, its reality.<BR>   Now to my fellow Americans of Italian or Sicilian descent WHO are offended by these types of mafia movies, ...sorry, but crime stories sell. An earlier reviewer said 'this is just a thin sliver of the &quot;italian american&quot;experience' Exactly! Scarface(83), State of Grace, Once Upon a Time in America, Year of the Dragon, even Pulp Fiction all deal with a &quot;thin sliver of life&quot; thats what makes them so intresting. Most of us find it intresting taking a look into another world in which we would never set foot. Its got nothing to do with besmirching any race of people.<BR> I realize that answering complaints about this great film is a waste of time. But its great film made by a great director, and outta respect for him and it I had to speak up.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Obviously, we are all aware that this DVD release is of the \\"special edition\\" movies and not the originals.  I would like to make several comments about that.  <br />First of all, one has to be puzzled by the mind of Star Wars' creator, George Lucas.  He created three movies that consistently rank among the greatest and most influential movies of all time.  The trilogy has spawned a marketing empire and set the tone for decades of science fiction films, few of which have come close to achieving what these films did starting way back in 1977.  <br />Undaunted by this extraordinary success, Mr. Lucas was apparently not satisfied with the movies, re-releasing his special editions of them in 1997 with added footage, enhanced sound, and new CGI effects.  (Rumor has it that he is re-working them again for the DVD, but time will tell if that's true or not). <br />While we would all like to re-work things we have done in the past, Mr. Lucas actually had the luxury of doing it.  Good for him.  I'm sure writers, artists, musicians and filmmakers go through that all the time, wishing they could change something they created in their youth.  But I would like to say, on behalf of anyone who agrees with me, that the original films were really good.  They weren't perfect, but I don't care.  I like them just the way they were.<br />Now, what is clear from reading other reviews is that fans are divided as to whether Mr. Lucas' new changes have enhanced or detracted from these classics.  I happen to the think the Star Wars special edition detracts from the original, while the two other special editions added some nice touches.  <br />Whether you like, love, or hate the special editions, what we all should agree on (with the possible exception of Mr. Lucas and those who profit from endless re-releases of these films) is that the original versions should also be made available on DVD.<br />Let's put this in perspective.  What if the DVD releases of Casablanca or The Seven Samurai werecolorized, and you couldn't get the black-and-white versions?  How about a special edition of The Godfather: Would you really want to have scenes altered in a classic like that (maybe they can make Moe Green pull out a gun and shoot first before getting shot in the eye)?  For that matter, let's just shelve all science fiction movies made before the advent of CGI until we can add new special effects.  Sound ridiculous?  It is, whether you shelve a thousand movies or just three.<br />While alternate versions are interesting, fun to watch, and sometimes improve on the original movies, they do not necessitate burying the original movies in a vault.  George Lucas has created something that is a part of film history, something that has become a part of millions of people's lives.  Why he insists his 1997 vision is so much more evolved than his 1977 vision is inexplicable.  Let's face it: there's absolutely no reason to hold back the original movies apart from money or foolish pride.  DVD is the perfect medium to give loyal fans everything they want.  Give us both versions of these movies please.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|For the first half hour I thought, &quot;Well, it starts really slow but...&quot;<br />For the next hour, I said, &quot;This movie has to go somewhere, some time... or at least it has to end.&quot;<br />And the ending stunk.  Other than those three parts, the beginning, middle and end, it was a great movie.<br />I was on an airplane for 9 hours and this was the only movie they showed on the screen.  It made the flight only longer.  God help us all if that movie was nominated for anything besides a turkey award.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions is one of my favorite movies. I think it is as good, if not better than Reloaded. The man vs. machine war is awesome. Neo fighting Smith is also way cool. The features on disc 2 are great. You get a sneak preview at The Matrix Online PC game, and the evolution of bullet time. There are also trailers for The Matrix, Reloaded, Revolutions, and Animatrix. In conclusion, the Matrix Revolutions a great movie with superb special effects. I recommend it to anyone interested in the Matrix, or sci-fi in general.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Any album that is not talking about puffing L's or blinging out in abundance is a breath of fresh air these days. Is the Bling-Bling era over yet? I sure hope so.<BR>This is the first RAP album I actually bought in 2 years, I love hip hop but hip hop has been on a Decline for awhile...the radio plays songs that we know any other time we wouldn't listen to..and they play it so much it grows on us til we are humming the chorus to ourselves without realising. It's hard to tell quality anymore. But once in awhile someone comes along and changes the &quot;climate&quot; a bit and they should get props for it.<br />Kanye West is this breath of fresh air. Yeah he is doing the same thing that P-Diddy did in the mid to late 90s with the Beat-biting from the oldschool days of the 80s...Kanye is just beat biting from that oldschool 70s &quot;love jones&quot; sound. But isn't sampling a part of what hip-hop is all about? He's on the ROC they've got tons of money to clear any sample he wants...and he's doing it with this advantage.<br />Kanye West is looking to do something different in hip hop...not so much &quot;for&quot; hip hop but &quot;in&quot; hip hop. He wears a Blazer jacket and jeans with a Le Tigre' Shirt...and carries a backpack (remember when backpacks was the style...even when nothing was in them?) and the thing is he does it with a straight face...but his whole style is more &quot;tongue in cheek...&quot; look at the guy's album cover for goodness sake...a bear?Hello. Why are people saying &quot;He is no Tupac&quot; I don't think that is his intention whatsoever. His lyrics are average yeah (unfortunately Jay-Z didn't ghost write anything), but the rapping style is very reminiscent of &quot;The Pharcyde&quot; and &quot;Souls of Michief&quot; (that whole 1992 sound..I'm surprised I didn't hear a &quot;iggidy-wigiddy&quot; in here somewhere)<BR>There's alot of hype around Kanye especially because he's on the Rocafella label but even if he wasn't, something about himis special either ways.<br />It's definitely a &quot;Entertaining album&quot; it doesn't really break any NEW ground but still a great effort and creativity. and if he never releases another album he is still a hot producer.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This is a model DVD release for a rock band. No corners seem to have been cut! The concert footage itself is very good, the extras are excellent, and there's a lot of care and attention paid to every last detail of the packaging. This probably isn't the best concert in Queen's history, but it's probably the best filmed Queen concert, and that's more than good enough for me. Everything you loved, or hated, or loved to hate about the band is preserved in exceptional detail. It's almost like being there. I prefer this DVD to other filmed Queen concerts, to be honest. Queen were not only first-rate rockers but also fantastic showmen, and Freddie and Brian's showmanship is nothing but captivating. This is one of my favorite concert DVDs, and is well worth a purchase instead of the collections of Queen lip-synched videos also available on the market.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Its Believe, enough said.  Its like \\"girl just wanna have fun\\" by cyndi lauper, in this way only: Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This album, which is dedicated to gay men (by the way [ said Cher ]) hit the charts and stayed at number one for months!!! Everyone was litening to it and it was Cher's most rememborable period in  life. Okay okay, enough about believe. The other tracks are great too!<BR>  Strong enough-its also a song that many would enjoy after hearing for the first time. I love it cus' its so silly and it has such a fun vibe.<BR>   All or nothing is similiar to song for the lonely almost. it has that feeling thats so raw and down to the soul.<BR>   The power- its such an interesting song, like no other Cher's ever done. <BR>   And of course there are many more. I would have to say my least favorite on this album would have to be \\"taken back my heart.\\" Nothings there, its just to bland and i don't care for it.<BR>  So there you have it! Buy it, and enjoy!(...)
B000003TAR|5.0|Ten years without Mr. Kurdt Cobain. The &quot;D&quot; stands for Donald if you don't know what I mean. This is the last record recorded by &quot;Nirvana&quot;. I think &quot;Nirvana&quot; is the best band of all time. No I know it is. This album features the songs &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;Rape me&quot;. This cd is great because wal-mart and k-mart would refuse to take in this record because it featured the song &quot;Rape me&quot;. Which makes this album great? The last recorded album turned out to be amazing. People think in this record the song &quot; Tourette's&quot; is great, but they love the &quot;From the Muddy banks of Wishka&quot; version was better. I think this version is better though. This album has the recorded version of &quot;All Apologies&quot;, which is good, well I like it, but I think the &quot;unplugged in New York&quot; version is better. Over all this is a great album. The last album by Nirvana. I don't think it's the best record, but it will do.
B00003CXC6|5.0|This is an excellent movie with lots of deep meaning. Intriguing and wonderful. The director is genius
B00005JLD4|5.0|With so many fine reviews ahead of me, I will make this one short.  This is a film that had the impact of a life changing influence on me.  As a white, middle class American woman, I deeply identified with Molly's plight, though she was an Aboriginal girl from Australia.  I walked with her through the harsh Outback landscape, after escaping the oppression of the internment camp.  I strained with her as she carried her sister on her back for hundreds of miles, longing to get home,  I felt her faith return when she found the rabbit proof fence, and felt her strength return when she woke up by hearing the call of her hawk, her spirit bird, helping to guide her.  <br />Very few movies in my life have given me such inspiration, and told a true story with such dedication, care and artistry.  After seeing the movie, I am now reading more about the experiences of other indigenous cultures who  suffered the terrible impact of colonization and still suffer today the current dominant culture's exploitation.  I have been reading the books of Doris Pilkington (Molly's daughter) and other indigenous women writers who have reclaimed their dignity and spirituality in telling their stories.  Rabbit Proof Fence opened my eyes and took me out of my comfort zone, yet in such a beautiful, uplifting way.  <br />Another quick note:  it is worth watching the documentary called Following the Rabbit Proof Fence.  It is fascinating because it shows us how the children were discovered for the roles, and how challenging it was for all involved.  Bringing different cultures together, along with bringing Aboriginal children together who had never acted before from remote parts of Australia presented a bold task, but resulted in a remarkable feat of film making.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie is not about the glorification of war. It's not even about the glorification of the American efforts in Europe. This movie is about a group of extremely young men gathered up from every walk of life and thrust into one of the most difficult situations imaginable. They were forced to kill and be killed. This movie is about innocence lost and the hollow shells left behind. I for one think this movie accomplishes this point spectacularly.<br />And to all the amateur historians posting negative reviews about the accuracy of this film, please get one thing straight: If it weren't for the thousands of Americans who fought and died in Europe, the Third Reich would most likely still be in existence.  The English were fighting valiantly and had, for the most part staved off invasion, but would have never been able to pull off a counter-attack without the Americans. The Russians were about to be conquered, and if it weren't for the second front created by the Americans and English, probably would have been crushed. The rest of mainland Europe was either conquered in a matter of days, or collaborating with the Germans. Sure there were underground resistance movements in many countries like France and Norway that contributed greatly to the efforts of the allies, but does anyone believe for an instant they could have made a difference on their own?<br />So before you start a righteous rant about what American soldiers did in the heat of battle or the way an American film portrays the war, visit the cemeteries at Normandy and kneel down before each and every cross or Star of David to thank that man profusely for the sacrifice he made for the life you live today.<br />One more point, related specifically to the individuals complaining about the American-centric stance of this movie: when a European studio wants to make a film about their catastrophic collapse when German tanks rolled up, more power to them. This is our movie. We know what our grandfathers did for you and we don't care what you think.
0441003257|5.0|I believe a very good way to start a review on Good Omens is to tell you that it's a bloody amazing read. Good Omens is funny, clever, and creative. The book is centered around the actual characters just as much or more than the actual events that make up the plot. Which is fantastic because the characters are amazing. Crowley is smart, stylish, clever. Aziraphale is bumbling and a bit stuffy. Shadwell is... well... I believe Shadwell may be much more entertaining if you don't know him ahead of time. He's almost lovable in his fanaticism. No, not almost. He is lovable. When you really get into the book the characters just seem so real. The events are still totally fantastical but the characters just feel so real.<br />The teaming up of Mr. Gaiman and Mr. Pratchett is brilliant. Their writing styles and characters blend together so seamlessly that you almost can't tell that there's two people writing. At the same time, fans of either author can easily pick out the little bits of their style that stand out (like Mr. Pratchett's footnotes).<br />All in all... I highly recommend that everyone go out and read this. You won't regret it.
1573301051|5.0|I liked this DVD from the minute it started, but I particularly LOVED it when Celine took the stage, she was GREAT!!! And not talking about her duet with Carole King (another great singer). I also loved Celine, Gloria and Shania singing along with Carole \\"You've got a friend\\", it was absolutely wonderful. And the end, GOD!!! THE END!!!! When all the divas sing \\"A Natural Woman\\" and Aretha and Celine sing \\"Testimony\\", was absolutely incredible!!! About what some of you said, that Celine ruined the show and that she isn't a diva, COME ON PEOPLE!!!! GIVE HER A BREAK!!!! She DIDN'T ruined the show, no one did!! All of them were GREAT!!! (specially Celine and Aretha) Oh! and please don't say that Celine was trying too hard to reach the high notes, 'cause she WASN'T. I think that Mariah has lost her voice a little bit, 'cause SHE was the one trying too hard to reach the high notes, although she sounded good too, I mean not as good as I expected but good anyway, everyone did.<br />Anyway... GREAT show, GREAT DVD, GREAT singers, all the Divas in one stage, absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|As my girlfriends and I walked into the movie cinema on the weekend that Kill Bill was released, we were either going to watch Tarentino's movie or a Denzel flick. <BR>We picked Kill Bill, and what we saw was one of the most gorrish, violent, and bloody movies in our lives...And we loved every scene.<BR>Lucy Liu was the \\"beast\\" in her scene. Her entourage rocked! Uma Thurman was the best person for the character she portrays. At the end of the movie, we were left wanting more and when we saw that closing scene, we left the theater mad as the devil because we just knew that we wouldn't be able to wait for Vol. 2 with ease. <BR>Folks, get the movie. This one is a heavyweight.
B00018D44U|5.0|I loved Norah Jones's first CD \\"Come Away With Me,\\" and I have been waiting ever since for her second album. \\"Feels Like Home\\" to my delight, is a great follow up of \\"Come Away With Me.\\" I am not sure if it is possible to top an album such as her first, but I think \\"Feels Like Home\\" is definitely worth listening. My favorite songs of this album are \\"Creepin' In\\" and \\"Toes.\\" Both songs are fun to listen to and the lyrics are meaningful. Her sultry voice is pleasing to the ears and extremely relaxing. I do agree with some reviewers who felt that this album is less \\"jazzy\\" and more country or soulful. However, I don't consider it as bad as I think Norah Jones has her unique style which is what makes her songs/albums so special. I do however have a small criticism of this album - I feel that most of the songs are very similar sounding. Regardless of that, \\"Feels Like Home\\" is still a great CD - definitely relaxing.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Don't get me wrong: I liked the movie a lot. But this is a skimpy DVD and knowing how Miramax works, just the first of several editions. If you hold off buying this one and put the money aside, I'm sure you'll have opportunities to buy Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together for a lower price - or the rumored Kill Bill: Director's Cut that will show it as one 3-hour movie. Those later editions will likely have all the extras - this one doesn't look like it has much. As someone who's been burned by Miramax's DVD practices before, I just want to offer you a warning. Be patient - and you'll be rewarded later.

B00013RC9I|5.0|I think is the best Air CD since 'Moon Safari'. I was kinda disappointed with '10,000 Hz Legend', I was like, \\"WTF is THIS?!\\", but 'Talkie Walkie' is really different from either of the previously mentioned albums, and right now, it is one of my favourites! Melting and swirly..
B0001BUFHQ|5.0|If you thought &quot;Going Inside&quot; rocked, that was an intro to &quot;Shadows Collide with People&quot;!  As in &quot;Going inside&quot;, this CD is personal, thought provoking, raw, and rocking.  Frusciante's musicianship and song writing is much stronger.  If your a fan, get the CD.
0792839730|1.0|The movie itself is well worth seeing. Very entertaining and pretty historically accurate, but...<BR>I bought the DVD at Best Buy and it &quot;froze&quot; early into the movie. I exchanged it at Best Buy for another DVD copy and that one froze in almost the same exact spot! Luckily I got my money back. <BR>I'm not going to bother trying another copy. I don't know if Best Buy just got a bad batch or if this glitch occurs in most of the DVD copies.
