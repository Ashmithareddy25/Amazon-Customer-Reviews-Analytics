B009UX2YAC|5.0|Saw my nephew playing subway surfer. He challenged to play me. Needless to say he won. So I decided to download it on my new kindle fire. It's an addictive game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If ur looking for the perfect game for kids then uv just found it. This game changes themes about every month so u won't have the same ol theme all the time. With all the boards and people you've got a challenge on ur hands. Kids just love it
B00132S74A|5.0|Another great Follet book that you just can't put down.  I read it several years ago and enjoyed it just as much this time.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I recommend this book to all my loved ones.<br /><br />I received that everything I desire is and can be mine.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting and obviously worth the money since it was kinda free. there's lots of similar games out there, but you don't really need to go findnthemfind them now.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This case exceeded my expectations.  Nice fit and look.  I like the two zipper design that lets me recharge the Kindle Fire HD while it is still in it's protective case.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With all they hype, I couldn't wait to read this.  I was so disappointed.  If you want shocking, get your hear racing, erotica, read Anne Rice's (writing under thepseudonym of A. N. Roquelaure) Sleeping Beauty Trilogy.  I am not even going to waste my time on the rest of the Fifty Shades books.
B00846WWVM|2.0|It's frustrating because the water to fire physics don't make sense.  I'm not sure if there's a technique to it but I just keep spraying and nothing happens.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Were seen in the trailer.  I was really hoping for more, but this movie was not as funny as Knocked Up.  Judd Apatow's girls were adorable in it though.  :)
1465001107|5.0|I love the pictures in here from different eras.Good product service,and everything.I love you so much Michael Joseph Jackson.&#34;Always and Forever&#34;,MUAH!
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|update 6/9/2013:  i am now many episodes in, nearing the end in fact, and this has remained THE ARTSIEST crime show on tv.  i have never seen crime scenes or corpses rendered with such artistic detail.  plus every other art experiment in film occurs in this series.  i can scarcely believe this level of experimentation is going on in a network tv show!  one warning: part of this artsiness involves the sound and this may not have been a grand idea.  if you can get subtitles along with this show, it will greatly help it until they decide good sound is more important than sound experiments.<br /><br />my original review follows:<br /><br />in general i have disliked the Hannibal franchise which followed the wonderful SILENCE OF THE LAMBS directed by jonathan demme.  the only reason i decided to give this a chance is because i like hugh dancy who plays will graham, the profiler.  much to my surprise, therefore, i discovered this is a tremendous, beautifully stylized, most artistic reimagining of hannibal and will.  the actor who plays hannibal is also terrific. i was absolutely crestfallen that i could not watch episode two then and there. the premise is that will does not realize hannibal is a serial killer. in fact, the two of them work together on cases plus Hannibal becomes will's psychiatrist! hannibal, of course, is a practicing psychiatrist and will is a teacher and fbi agent.  will also has borderline asperger's syndrome in this new telling.  give it a try.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007FC3AAI|5.0|The movie was suspenseful. It was a interesting and held my attention. I would recommend it. I liked it better than the book.
1451662432|5.0|I got the book and still reading it!!!  It would be a good book for people like me that are a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger!!!  I got the hard copy edition because one day if i see Arnold i would want his signature!!!!  Really good book!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game sure does pass the time away all the temple run games get better as each one comes out the gal on temple two sure does run a long way. Be careful.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a really great game.  Beautiful scenery and lots of different mini games play. Very hard to do.  I would recommend it highly.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I b e believe this is one of the best books I ever read and I wish there was a sequel!!!!!!!!
B00BVVA138|5.0|KSE is back and does not disappoint! If you're a fan of KSE of the past, you'll love this album.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I THINK YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIIE FIRST, BUT IF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE, YOU WILL LOVE THE ALBUM
B003G4W49C|3.0|I decided to read this novel due to all the book and up coming movie hype. I wont describe the premise or hint at a plot as Im sure you have read it enough in other reviews. Just simply I thought this book took a while to really get going. A lot of the stuff going on was repetitive and drudged along. Then with about a third of the book to go it got really exciting with a big twist.  I did enjoy it, it just took to long for me to get there.  I will be looking forward to the movie for sure.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Good movie. Really like Harrison Ford and Rachel McAdams. Rachel was superb. And Harrison Ford was great as always.  I highly recommend it.
B00511ONPG|5.0|A delightful and thorough look at social media marketing.  Easy read with excellent examples and stories.  It doesn't matter whether you re new to social media or a seasoned pro.  You ll find something new to grow your business!
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Having seen & loved the movie, I bought the book - and it was everything I'd hoped for. Reading through some of the comprehensive reviews already on this book's page, the one I agree with most is - just read it - let the plot wash over you and enjoy each story as it unfolds. As another reviewer has commented, this won't appeal to everyone, but those who make the connection will be rewarded.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|I love it more with each listen. As one who loved progressive rock, and misses the thought provoking dream-scapes I used to escape to... this fits the bill quite wonderfully! Brilliant work!
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the story, a broken man and a solid young woman. I've read the series six times, can't get enough!
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|this app d***!!! it stinks all off the apps! I hate it! it crashes my kindle and gives wrong answers!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book was great! Was a great read and can not wait for more to come out! Will read them all.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|The story has been done time and time again.  At least it is a feel good movie leaving you feel good.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Beautiful game that works well on the Fire!  I'd buy it for the graphics alone.  Similar to several of the big fish games but like someone else said plated the ones for this device so i will definitely be looking forG 5 again
B0015DROBO|4.0|This whole series is worth reading. It makes you feel like your a part of the plot and is hard to put down.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I've had this game a long time on my PC.  I got it from Gamehouse and was immediately addicted.  I am so happy that I am now able to play it on my kindle.  It is just as much fun!  Love it!
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This has been a great game. At first it's very easy and then it starts to get a little harder. At present, I'm stuck. But I'll keep working on it till I get it and move on to the next one.
0061733199|5.0|This book is a great read for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors. I dont mean the campground camping type either. I mean the ones who brave nature and take their happy hind-parts somewhere like the A.T. It also has sections about how to survive using your car, and how to keep that car operating in harsh environments. A good read for anyone who has a decided to have a plan in the event that something goes awry.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoy these match-three games. This one has seven main levels (countries) and each country has several games within it that you have to complete. As you complete each game, you get 2-3 sentences of history on the item you just earned. Each puzzle has a trick to it and keeps you hooked. You race against a clock and try to get a top score of three stars. Once you complete a level, you rearrange puzzle pieces to make your passport stamp.  The colors pop, the reaction time is quick, and the story line is nice. Warning... if you get started it's hard to stop!
B003EEMIV8|5.0|Great truck does everything it said it would  My grandson loves it great price arrived on time  I recommend it
0743435729|4.0|I read the first book ([[ASIN:1451638825 On Basilisk Station, 20th Anniversary Edition (Honor Harrington)]]) and quite liked it, so I was excited to learn it was just part of such a prolific series. That first book was about a captain, Honor Harrington, who commands her ship The Fearless to thwart an invasion by the People's Republic of Haven spearheaded by a much, much larger battleship and against the backdrop of an insurrection of the local planet's population, which has been covertly stirred by the invaders.<br /><br />Then I read this book (\\"Honor of the Queen\\"), which is about a captain, Honor Harrington, who commands her ship The Fearless to thwart an invasion by the People's Republic of Haven spearheaded by a much, much larger battleship and against the backdrop of an insurrection of the local planet's population, which has been covertly stirred by the invaders.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the third book in the series, but I'm hoping it's not about a captain, Honor Harrington, who commands her ship The Fearless to thwart an invasion by the People's Republic of Haven spearheaded by a much, much larger battleship and against the backdrop of an insurrection of the local planet's population, which has been covertly stirred by the invaders. Just to mix things up a bit, yes?
B007JNWQZS|5.0|My wife loves these movies more than me, but they go beyond entertaining, they transcend it. The characters and stories are at times beyond belief, but they are so good you can watch them over and over and still be entertained and amazed at the simplicity of the stories, yet the complexity of the Director. Great stuff.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The hero is an expert assassin. Will Robie works for a secret and unnamed organization at the top of the US Government that kills people considered - by someone to be enemies of the State. That turned me off for a while and I delayed buying the book. But one of his early assignments, he refuses to kill a women as she sleeps in a bed with  her toddler son. Then his backup assassin shoots both the woman and her son with one shot from a powerful rifle. Will Robie decides he'd better get out of there, knowing that the backup sniper's target was now him. Then he sees hears and smells a younger baby sleeping under the bed.  He picks up the baby and runs with it. He had previously scouted the building and knew of a lady with kids on a lower floor. He delivered the baby to her door and ran. That convinced me the book was probably worth reading. Robie soon becomes attached to a freshly orphaned 14-year-old girl when he had to subdue a professional killer that tried to kill the girl on a bus Robie was riding to get away. He takes the girl with him off the bus, leaving the killer temporarily tied up. The bus blows up. The two run to get away despite finding another hit man in their way.<br /><br />The story builds as a socialization effort for Robie whose solitary bachelor life is severely disturbed by three women - Julie, the 14-year-old, \\"super agent\\" Vance of the FBI, so named by Julie, and Annie Lambert, a good-looking blonde who happens to live in Robie's apartment building and with whom he develops a complicated relationship even though he spends only a little time with her.<br /><br />Julie, Vance and Robie all contribute to solving the mystery while growing into a strong unit. This story will hold your interest to the very end.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The beginning, of the first book, was a little slow but if you keep plugging along you will find you can't put this book down! The first book lays the ground work in learning about Lisbeth but it is the second book that you get to know who she really is! The second book is fast paced and definitely can't put it down. The third book was good but slower paced but you don't want to put it down because you need to find out what happens to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series. Each show leaves you wanting more. All the characters play a crutial part in every episode, not one being left to wonder where they went. Great writing. Can't wait to see more.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Loved it I just can't stop playing it . The kids loved it . It was easy for them to do
B008D36INE|4.0|This film is not for everybody.<br />That is not to say that all the poor reviews are justified, but some may be put off by the screen play's faithful adaption from a staged play.  The film is a slow but rewarding watch with strong performances by all three of the leading actors.... for film viewers with patience.
0812550706|5.0|What can I say about Ender's Game that hasn't been said before? It's a great book, and Amazon has it for a great price. If you love the Ender Series or just want a good book to read, this a great buy for an affordable price. This is a paperback author's definitive edition of the book, so some things may be different from the original book but not very much as I have heard (just minor details to coincide with the times). I would definitely recommend reading this before the movie comes out this year. Many people judge books by the movies because they never read the books, but don't be that person. I have read this book many times, and each time I have enjoyed every bit of it. What are you waiting for? Go jump into the world of Ender's Game!
B00BPLDCVM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the show and comics. It was awesome hearing certain songs and matching them to their wonderful scenes from the show. It was like reliving it and being in the scene. Wonderful music all around.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was not the best interactively. You cannot press on anything but what is sparkling. Easy and fun game for someone who is a beginner. Good story line.
159562015X|5.0|Our church small group did this so we would learn each other's strengths. It lead to really great discussions. Recommend!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I tried a couple of other hidden object games and this by far is the best. It is addictive! I do wish the energy restored a little faster but i don't have a problem waitiing.    Removed 3 stars.  I love this game but have not been able to play for months because it won't load on my kindle I don't want to uninstall because i accumulated a lot of food items and charms.  I am also somewhere around level 80.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I thought it was a really good price for the three movies on blu ray. I am really happy with my purchase.
B003QSMC18|5.0|So fun! It made us plan a trip to New Orleans! This is a great film for families but I would recommend it to anyone, any age.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|The charging port crashes my ipod touch, which means I had to completely reset my ipod and reload all of my music again. This in not a genuine Apple product. Total waste of money!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|It was thrilling. It's one of those,\\"Just couldn't put it down.\\" I just couldn't and wouldn't put it down at all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfed it is awesome! it works great sometimes freezes but still really really fun!!!!!! this is great!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|very entertaining it just wasn't as good as i thought it would be. It had its moments when i was kinda bored but all in all worth the watch.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a fun way to spend a little time between tasks.  Banishing the critters around the castle can be a neat scavenger hunt.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The only problem i had was that ted (seth macfarlane) kept slipping into stewie and peter griffins voice. other then that i really enjoyed it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|A neat little game with lots of variety in the creatures and quests. The baby dragons are super cute ad their dances amusing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved everything about this book and what it has to say. It's a book that changes your perspective on things without even trying.
B000SW4DP8|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Non Hollywood. Beautifully sweet. Cried and couldnt get out of my seat at end of movie. It is actually story of Jim Sheridans coming to New York with his family to become actor.
0981951244|5.0|This book lays out the basic no nonsense path to impovement. It takes all the mumbo jumbo out of the way and makes easy to understand. This no sales book. You are not going to make a million dollars next week if you read this book. You may learn how to save a million for retirement.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I have and love horses. I will buy any DVD that has to do with horses.<br />Some are fair, some are good and some are great, like this one....WAR HORSE.....It's part of history.<br />Good acting & filming.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The thing I like about this app is that it's naturally good and not like the other apps where all the good stuff costs money. You can count on this not to do that.<br />Yeah, this app is definitely a keeper!!&lt;3
B0086VWCPG|1.0|I bought it about a month ago for my android phone for 3.99$ and after buying an iphone 5, i could not instal it on ios and had to pay 4.99$ for the mac version. this is not fair. i believe if you buy an app , you should have the option to install it on any device.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really fun! Every time subway surfers updates I HAVE to find out where it is going next! I can't wait to go to the next place. There are a few glitches though, which can be really annoying. There are a lot of adds that pop up, but I can deal. I play this almost every day!
B00BK5D95C|5.0|The first time I heard Alt-J's album, An Awesome Wave, I grew an instant like them. The album is very short but I can still listen to it over and over and over again! I've seen them in Milwaukee and they're performance was AMAZING! (Can't wait for Lolla this summer!!!)  They have more than good harmonious sound! Everytime I listen to their album I get a better understanding from it :) Alt-J has soul - love these guys!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is one of the best games I have ever played in my life<br />It has really cool updates,the people chasing you are hilarious
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was such a good book. Worth the money!!! So sad but very inspiring. A great read for anyone 13+. Makes you think about everything you have and how good your life really is.
0345803493|5.0|It's just a wonderful read. You will definitely want to read the triology in order so you will understand all that is going on. You will not be able to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun doging police like the monsters in temple run and I also love the power ups and mystery boxes and the double coin feature
0345803507|5.0|Must read!!! You can't put it down. I read the entire triology in a little over a week. One just gets better than the other.
0307352153|5.0|Great read, with lots of case studies so you truly know how behavioral professionals view introverts and extroverts. If you are an introvert you will feel better about yourself, and you will understand those crazy extroverts better. Extroverts will get a glimpse into the inner worlds of  their introverted friends and family and what makes them tick. It is the the &#34;Mars and Venus&#34; book of the introvert-extrovert equation.
0062127241|5.0|Outstanding.  Pete is an amazing musician and his story is fascinating.  It's very well written.  I read it twice and picked up several details I had missed in the first go around.  Loved it the second time as well ... always a good sign.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Having never read Hugh Howey, I was not sure what to expect in this work. It had been recommended to me by a friend, which I'm told is how it became popular in the first place. The story is immediately engaging and the characters developed well. Even the antagonist becomes a sympathetic figure as we learn the background of his job. I was very impressed and will continue to read the series, as I'm sure there will be sequels.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Advertized price drop is what got me. Now can we do the same with Star Wars complete collection on Blue Ray
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've always wished I could have attended law school.  This is one of few media productions that doesn't show the profession as &#34;evil&#34; and it reveals some of the things that good lawyers must cope with.
086571701X|1.0|To quote another review here: \\"[Sylvia's]'world view' sounds like the sheeple gruel that they spoon feed in the gov't elementary propaganda mills.[Does she]actually ever have any original thoughts? That entire chapter is a complete waste of GMO soy ink and oil dependent recycled paper. Just what world [DOES she] live in?\\"<br /><br />The immediate turn off was the ignorant preaching at the beginning of her book. I just want to learn how to grow my own food - not read the preaching of an automaton that has been thoroughly brain washed. Then to read here on Amazon her insecure responses to anyone that gives her book 1 star confirmed what I already knew. Don't give your money to this pathetic author. You'd be better saving it and using Bing or YouTube to find out what you need to know to start your own Aquaponics garden.
B00C4Y4434|5.0|PD Lagoona has seahorses and fishbones all over her outfit, a great shiny pink n silver scaled cutie pants, mis match earrings dangling shells and a seahorse tail and a puffer fish pink and yellow handbag that could also be a sea urchin handbag and her school folder has a seahorse clasp--can you tell I love seahorses?  She and Frankie are my fave characters and I have nearly all their dolls.  The other PD dolls didn't really do it for me--the best line so far I think for all dolls has been Ghouls Rule, followed by the Sweet 1600 line, again for all the dolls being ones I collected.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Don't bother with this movie if you don't like nuanced characters, subtle twists in plot, or cerebral suspense but not terror. Or, for that matter, gore unflishingly displayed. No fanged monsters here, only an amazing hero, flawed but courageous, who you cannot help but cheer for. I could not turn away, and a week after I saw it, i'm still, on recollection, finding this film a real gem.
B008R14YBK|4.0|My daughter loves Bridget's music. I really like it, too. She has music I'm not worried about my daughter listening, too.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|When it loads the stream, it looks okay but is often 226p or so, even with good bandwidth.  The lack of login ability and failure to load more than a subset of the most popular plays of various games mean that it can be tough to find your favorite, unpopular streams.  Often the load screen just circles and circles requiring an app restart.<br /><br />Hey, the price is right (free), but I often end up just watching Twitch through the browser on the Kindle because it works better.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I have listened and loved his music since the Fairport Convention day. He just keeps getting better with every disc.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I read the orignal play years back in college.  I've seen this and that movie version of the play.  I waited a year for this movie to come to theaters because I was dying to see what Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Amanda Siefried could do for this storyline and soumdtrack.  And then of course I had to wait for the Blu-Ray to be marketed so I could add it to my collection of movies to watch over and over again.  Like I said:  It was worth the wait.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the best ever I was glad I found this and got this game it is so much fun I may never stop playing this.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Got a little caught up in all the hype but still maintained a skeptical viewpoint because of the &#34;reality show&#34; connotations and I do not watch reality shows.  I loved it--nuf said.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I really enjoyed this season and good to knowi can watch it again whenever I want since its not available on Netflix
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It is easy to use and I love the variety. I love that you can blend sounds and adjust the volume of each one. You can also save your favorite blends and use a timer. I use it every night!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game you won't be able to stop playing. I play subway surfed everywhere I go. Try it you enjoy. It never ends.
B007REV4T8|1.0|This review is not specifically for the DVD, but for the movie itself.<br /><br />As with all of the Bond films, I find the lead character interesting. Not likeable, but interesting. This show, as with the others, was interesting and engaging. It seemed quite a lot more creepy than the last one, though, and I did not like it as much. I would give it three stars for entertainment quality.<br /><br />The reason I am writing this review, however, and the reason I am giving the entire movie just one star, is that I have one TREMENDOUS issue with something not just amoral but actually a horrible human rights atrocity which is portrayed in the middle of the film.<br /><br />Bond is typically a womanizer; no news there. But typically it seems that his sexual encounters are with women who also choose the encounter.<br /><br />Not so in one (of the three) such encounters in this film.<br /><br />While trying to track down the bad guy of this particular film, Bond meets a woman (Severine) who he senses is gripped by great fear. He catches her wrist, notes that she is marked as a prostitution slave, and declares that he can help her, that he will track down the bad guy of the film and set her free. I should note that it is not absolutely clear whether the man (the bad guy of whom she is in mortal fear) is still using her for sex after removing her from outright forced prostitution, but it certainly seems that way. Severine gives Bond the information regarding where he can find her (if he succeeds in knocking off a few guys first, which of course he does) so that he can go with her to the lair of the bad guy.<br /><br />There is no indication in this scene that Bond and the woman are romantically interested in one another.<br /><br />The next scene in which they meet again shows the woman taking a shower on her boat, unaware that Bond has made it to the boat as well. He slips in naked to the shower behind her, and of course the scene closes soon afterward with the assumption that things progress sexually between them from there.<br /><br />I am phenomenally disturbed by this incredible perversion of justice! This woman was a SLAVE. Literally held captive and used for sex. Bond tells her that he can rescue her. And then what does he do? He uses her for sex.<br /><br />Let me say it again. This woman was held captive as a sex slave. Against her will. And what does James Bond do? He uses her for sex. This is not even a voluntary one-night-stand kind of situation, as detestable and sad as such a situation might be. This is Bond assuming that he can have sex with a woman who is at that very time being held hostage (presumably still as a sex slave) against her will. As such, she has no way to escape from Bond. How despicable and ghastly would it be for a man to treat a woman as inhumanely as is here shown?<br /><br />I am deeply disturbed by this atrocious, horrendous, despicable scene.<br /><br />There are literally millions of women across the globe who are currently held captive against their will for such evil purposes as these. It is absolutely heartbreaking. To see this perverse evil endorsed in such a way by the lead character of such a popular movie is beyond disgusting. It is heinous.at things progress sexually between them from there.<br /><br />I am phenomenally disturbed by this incredible perversion of justice! This woman was a SLAVE.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this app is really useful!  I like the fact that you can customize your own notebook and the cover on it! I also like using it because I can talk about everything that is going on in my life! I can be personal about my feelings and secrets! I give this app five stars! keep up the good work!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Excellent yarn, very up-to-date and believable!! Actors all did their work well, it was a type of movie you could have friends over to watch!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|You know when you watch a movie hoping to be blown away by artistic talent so that even if you don't understand the concept of the film you somehow still walk away changed from it?<br /><br />Yeah...this is NOT that.<br /><br />It was incredibly boring with a muddled plot and left you with a million unanswered questions. I know, I know, some of you enjoy being left with a million questions that make you ponder life, the way people think, and what does it all mean???<br /><br />Yeah...this is NOT that.<br /><br />Please, please spend your time elsewhere with other movies. For example, 'Melancholia' (beautifully done and depressing but poignant about how depressed people see the world even as it is ending) or 'Requiem for a Dream' (depressing and gruesome in a this-is-how-life-actually-IS way)  or 'Pan's Labyrinth' (how the lines between fantasy and reality can blur).<br /><br />Pi is just not worth the time.

0451232852|1.0|I borrowed this book from the library -so thankful I didn't purchase it! The characters were stereotyped into little molds of good and bad. Wealthy=bad and stupid; poor= good and smart.<br /><br />I must have more faith in a reader than Mr. Follett to think that anyone would buy into this narrowmindedness.<br /><br />Not to mention the war scenes were boring and the character encounters ludicrous.  I loved Pillars of the Earth, but this was terrible.

B008JFUO0Y|4.0|The term \\"cult classic\\" gets thrown around quite a bit, mostly in association with a film that does poorly at the box office or a film that is so incredibly bad that it's considered good.  However, the proper meaning of a \\"cult classic\\" has more to do with the specific fan base, rather than the amount of money it fails to bring in to theaters.  But, just because a film is considered a commercial failure doesn't mean it meets the criteria to be deemed a future \\"cult classic.\\"  To meet the criteria, word of mouth comes into heavy play, not to mention it helps when the height of the film's popularity happens to be on home video.  In recent years, films like Fight Club, Donnie Darko, Office Space, and The Big Labowski, have all been deemed \\"cult classics.\\"  If you notice, none of these films have been released within the last ten years, meaning \\"cult classics\\" are established over time.  They aren't necessarily judged in one specific viewing, but rather over the course of several viewings.  No one really knows what the next \\"cult classic\\" will be - because it just happens over time.  Regardless, any \\"cult classic\\" list MUST include the original Sam Raimi film, The Evil Dead (1981) - which spawned two sequels, and a 2013 remake/reboot.<br /><br />Produced by Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Robert G. Tapert and directed by Fede Alvarez, Evil Dead is the story about five individuals staying in a cabin in the woods.  Mia (Jane Levy) is suffering from drug addiction and her friends take her to the cabin to help her through the withdrawal process.  However, after her brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez), arrives, years of bad blood come to the surface in regards to the death of their mother (from insanity).  Unfortunately, Mia starts having strange encounters (assuming it's the withdrawal or genetic insanity) and relies on her friends - Eric (Lou Taylor), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), along with her brother to help her.  But, after exploring the cabin, they discover a cryptic book (The Book of the Dead) with satanic scripture and pictures that unleashes pure evil, causing them to become possessed.<br /><br />After years of rumors, the next chapter in the Evil Dead series has finally arrived.  Unlike so many other terrible horror remakes in recent years, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead stays true to its roots.  In a purely brilliant move, this new Evil Dead takes place years after the original 1981 film - meaning Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) is not completely irrelevant, even though he doesn't appear in the film.  Evil Dead reboots the franchise, but the car is still parked in the driveway.  For those that don't remember a whole lot of the original film, the bridge was out and the teens couldn't get home - so that same rundown, beat up car is still right where it was parked all those years ago when Ash was watching his friends get torn apart from the inside out.<br /><br />For the fans of the original franchise, Evil Dead is a throwback to the 400,000 low budget \\"cult classic\\" that fans know and love.  Even with this new group of friends visiting the cabin, the premise remains the same.  Once again, someone makes the mistake of reading from The Book of the Dead (even though it says not to on every single page), unleashing all hell on the cabin and those inside it.  If you're a fan of the original, and you thought that film was gory, this new film will bring back that nervous, yet exciting sense of nostalgia - full of blood, guts, bone crunching, and every form of bodily fluid you can think of.  In fact, here's a brief list of the ways this new film pays homage to the original:<br /><br />  Michigan State sweatshirt<br />  Same outdoor swing<br />  The necklace<br />  Deck of cards<br />  The clock<br />  Blood stains on the floor<br />  Chainsaw<br />  Shotgun<br />  Shaky camera shots<br />  Trees are alive<br />  Light bulb full of blood<br />  ...and much more<br /><br/>There is not one single disappointment to be found in this film.  Evil Dead is every single thing you'll want from a horror film.  From the bad (unknown) acting and pop-out, scary moments, to the \\"so cheesy, it's funny\\" moments - you'll absolutely have the time of your life with this film.  Does this film cater to lovers of the original franchise and horror enthusiasts?  Yes, absolutely.  This is not a great film to view if you're not a fan of the horror genre, but if you're willing to give it a try - you won't be disappointed.  And, if you are disappointed by it - that's too bad, because this is as great of a horror remake/reboot as you're ever going to see.<br /><br />P.S. - don't you dare leave your theater seat early...  There's a \\"groovy\\" surprise waiting for the diehard Evil Dead fans after the credits.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B+<br />FNDNreview.com/>There is not one single disappointment to be found in this film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This T.V. show is one of the epic pieces of work that Fox has let slip through over the years.  Despite Fox's ineptitude, the show got out and because and instant love for some many people.  You want a show with good drama, comedy, action, this is your show.  Staring Nathan Fillion as the captain of a smuggler ship taking cargo and people from one planet to the next centuries after the Earth was abandoned.  Fillion's character is just one of the reasons to watch the show.  He's not a good guy, he's not really a bad guy, but he sits on his own very careful side of the fence.  He hates the big government, which is basically a giant fascist regime that holds unyielding sway over the &#34;core worlds&#34; near the center of the galaxy and is always looking to expand its reach to the outer rim where the Firefly crew typically do their work under the radar.  I could go on but seriously you just should see it for yourself, you can watch it on amazon Prime, get the service for a month, watch the show and a few others while you're at it if you like it buy and and join us Brown coats!  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
B008JFUNYG|4.0|How do you review, Evil Dead 2013?  As a longtime fan of the franchise, I was utterly disgusted at the idea when it was announced, Campbell and Raimi's inclusion be damned.  I was planning a boycott, then the first few stills were released, and I was curious.  Then the trailer won me over and after an opening weekend viewing, what do I think?  Fede Alvarez's flick is pretty damn impressive.  It was also incredibly refreshing to see a horror movie, which aspired to simply be scaring.  Not tongue in cheek, nothing meta or too clever for its own good.  The Evil Dead is meant to scare audiences, and it succeeds far more than it falls short.  The setup to get our cast to the cabin, is original and refreshing.  Mia's(played bravely by Jane Levy) friends and family are helping her kick her heroin habit.  Once Mia is taken over by the deadite's this allows for the cast not freaking out as much as they would.  Mia is just going through withdrawals.  The other four relative newcomers play their parts admirably, and while there isn't very much background for them, they aren't paper thin either.  When s*** fully hits the fan Alvarez pulls out all the stops, and tries to hit the audience with everything he has.  The film is very violent, and a few times I felt like this was overly relied on.  Think twice about who you bring, as there were a few walkouts at my screening after a mutilation sequence.  That's not to say Alvarez's direction lacks a genuinely dark tone, he establishes a clear mood from the first frame.  The audio mix was also used very effectively.  Older fans will definitely recognize some reused audio.  The dialogue was a bit flat in places (which seems odd with Diablo Cody's involvement), relying heavily on profanity in the exchanges between the deadites and the survivors.  (Mind you this is not coming from someone who was offended.)  This is a minor qualm in an other wise very strong offering.  Evil Dead 2013 is original enough, while giving proper respect to theoriginal that spawned it.  While it's not the highest praise, but this is by far the best horror remake I've seen.  Genre fans should be pleased with this new addition to the Evil Dead franchise.  P.S. stick around until the credits end...if you're an older fan you'll thank me.    For more go to...  [...]
B0035HKWM6|1.0|Alright, so I bought the Mask, DVD, and they sent me a link and said you can watch it on Amazon too, I figured:  &#34;why not?&#34;  But when I got to watch the darn thing...I can't I click the link something goofs up and it doesn't play, I can't watch it, and if try the link again or try to reload because I should have like 24 hours to watch and enjoy, it says that it's already done, thanks for your time.  So I never get to watch the darn thing.  Now do I like Amazon Prime and the live video streaming?  Yes, Yes I love the darn thing I watch some fantastic seasons of shows and movies, etc!  This particular issue, however, has happened to me twice and I don't appreciate it.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

1594746168|4.0|I've always had an interest in art and the macabre. I remember discussing the works of Joel Peter Witkin and others before him, who use(d) corpses to create art, in an anatomy for drawing class while in college. The discussions were always somewhat of a footnote, never terribly in depth. I remember finding these men and their art interesting, but never gave it much more thought until I saw this book.<br /><br />I requested The Resurrectionist for two reasons. First, I was interested in the story of Spencer Black, and how the author presented this fictional man based on actual men of the time. There's a certain dark romanticism surrounding the medical field during the turn of the century. How far would an esteemed, educated, man go to unlock the secrets of the human body? One answer would be Dr. Gregory Black getting his two adolescent boys out of bed in the middle of the night to go dig up corpses. You may think that this is greatly exaggerated fiction. It is not. The characters are not real, but the events that transpire were very real during this time in our history. It was not uncommon to find empty graves where men and women were once buried. People have always leant their bodies to science, it is only recently that they have done so willingly.<br /><br />The second reason is, as an artist, I'm always looking for inspiration and reference material for paintings. Spencer Black is depicted as a VERY talented artist and his renderings of the anatomy of mythical creatures are second to none. The pencil drawings contained in this book are very detailed, phenomenal, pieces.<br /><br />The book itself is, conveniently, broken into two sections. The first is the fictional biography of Dr. Spencer Black. It is presented well, as if put together by compiling excerpts from his personal journal as well as his brother's. It starts with his childhood and quickly moves to adulthood, encapsulating his career and his obsessions. It is paced well, at about 80 pages there isn't much room for drawing out the story needlessly. However, I think the author could have done much more with the Dr. Black and his exploits. The foundation of the writing is an interesting enough premise that this book could easily be doubled without feeling exhaustive. It does a great job at being both fantastic and believable. It toes the line of fiction and non-fiction well. Had it not said fiction in the description, I would've thought Dr. Black was an actual person and this was a real biography. Because it's fiction, I think the author could've taken it a bit further and added a bit more detail to each section of Spencer's life.<br /><br />The Codex Extinct Animalia comprises the second half of this volume. This section is filled with anatomical renderings of mythical creatures. The renderings are presented well. There are both skeletal and muscular/connective tissue plates, each annotated. Details are provided as well as footnotes about Black's process of constructing and displaying each creation. I found the renderings very enjoyable. I think they will be great reference for any artist creating fantastic and mythical creatures in their work. This is a gold mine for animators as one of the hardest parts of animating creatures is understanding their anatomy and translating skeletal/muscular structures to their movements.<br /><br />Overall this is a very enjoyable book, particularly for those who enjoy the macabre, anatomy or both. It is both interesting and entertaining. My only complaint is the length. I hope that the author's next endeavor will be much more in depth. I look forward to it!ch room for drawing out the story needlessly. However, I think the author could have done much more with the Dr. Black and his exploits.

0061692034|2.0|The protagonist of Ford's latest novel is fifteen-year-old Del Parsons who lives in a small Montana town with his twin sister, Berner, and his parents, Bev and Neeva.  Del's normal life is altered forever when his parents rob a bank in North Dakota.  The parents are soon arrested, Berner runs away to California, and Del is spirited off to a small town in Saskatchewan by a family friend.  Del finds refuge from Arthur Remlinger, a mysterious American fugitive with a dark and violent past.<br /> The story of Del's personal growth is an interesting and unusual one but certainly not unique.  Ford gives us plenty of detail:  how Del feels about his sister and his parents, the many events Del witnesses, and the surroundings of Del's Montana town as well as small towns in Canada.  In the latter case, I grew weary of reading about seemingly every building, street, lamp post and other attractions in these small villages.  For me, this excess of information slowed down the story and didn't contribute much to the overall plot.<br /> In telling the story, Ford even spoils the plot himself twice.  In the first case, he mentions the bank robbery and then writes for many pages before the actual event takes place.  In a more aggravating way near the book's end, he casually mentions a dramatic event yet to happen and then proceeds to give us many more words before the actual event occurs.  In each case, I felt that he could have made the reading experience more enjoyable by not telegraphing the event and letting the tension build before the event is revealed and described.<br /> Del's father, Bev, is a retired Air Force officer.  Unfortunately, I found several errors about the military.  The circumstances surrounding Bev's reduction in rank from captain to first lieutenant and subsequent honorable discharge are wrong, the color of his jumpsuit is incorrect, and the color of captain's bars is silver, not gold.<br /> I've read Ford's Bascombe trilogy and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I regret that this one was a disappointment and even mildly irritating at times.t that this one was a disappointment and even mildly irritating at times.

B003VTZSFY|3.0|I really enjoyed this book, despite the fact that I found the reading difficult.  As a history of civilization, it is a great jumping off point for additional reading.  In making his case, the author included so many facts, that I found the enumeration of influential societies almost bewildering.  However, in the last section, he does a very good job of bringing the whole picture together.  I'm sure there are portions of the book I will reread, to further my understanding.  In the meantime, the book has stimulated my interest in delving into a number of historic periods in greater depth.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Hollywood did itself proud to award this perfectly-crafted thriller the Academy Award for 2012.  It's guaranteed to have you at seat's edge, so knotted up that you'll be constantly looking at your watch not out of boredom but to be assured that the unbearable tension can't go on forever.<br /><br />Graham Greene was a writer who distinguished between his deep, soul-searching works and his who-dunnit-style mysteries, calling the former \\"literature\\" and the latter \\"entertainments.\\"  \\"Argo\\" definitely shines as a stellar example of the latter.  Unlike the socio-theological examination of life that we get from \\"There Will Be Blood\\" or \\"No Country for Old Men\\" (or, for that matter, Shakespeare's tragedies), \\"Argo\\" pieces together an historical moment with such resourceful precision that we can only marvel at the craft of the director, which manifests a restraint, patience and attention to detail comparable to that of the Iranian children whom we witness piecing together the evidence of what we're seeing from the thousands of strips that have been confiscated from the overrun American  Embassy.<br /><br />In the script John Goodman, while helping Affleck construct the ruse that will permit him to free six Americans, calls directors stupid know-nothings, assuring Affleck that the American posing as a director has the easiest role of all.  At the end of the film, when the plane is finally off the ground, that individual playing a film director approaches the real director, Affleck, and extends his hand as a gesture of thanks and admiration.  As viewers we might do the same.  However it was done, \\"Argo\\" is at once a delicate balance and an infinitely complex mosaic of small pieces.  Yet, in the grand Hitchcock manner, nothing is wasted, nothing is gratuitous.  Every piece fits so well that for two hours we return to a moment in Iran in 1979.  If we leave the theater none the wiser, we also leave it marveling at where we have just been and what we have just seen.  Acting, spectacle, film scoring--all of these components of a movie are strangely irrelevant in \\"Argo.\\" All we're left with is the film.  There is absolutely no room for clutter.<br /><br />We knew going in that Jason's journey was sheer fantasy and that the movie within the movie (\\"Argo\\") was a sheer ruse.  Yet we need no convincing that the \\"Argo\\" we've just experienced was as real and believable as a film can be.  If Affleck's Argo played somewhat loose with the facts, it proves no less compelling than the mythological Argo--or the deception that proved successful to the mission.  In fact, the film succeeds because of the believability of 3 Argo's: the mythological story that has captivated readers for many centuries; the film fantasy concocted to contrive a release of the prisoners; the film we have just viewed and experienced for two breathless hours.<br /><br />There are three definitions of film that in my experience account for the compelling power of this art form to strike the sparks of truth from the stuff of imagination.  Orson Welles' \\"Ribbon of Dreams\\" is not nearly as flimsy and fantastical as it may initially appear.  From the scenario proposed by Affleck's character to the blocking out of characters and action, the entire project hung explicitly on cinema's hold on the imagination, its power to engage the viewer in a willing suspension of disbelief no less \\"real\\" than the most vivid dream or nightmare.  Second is Jean Luc Godard's definition, \\"film is truth 24 times a second,\\" reminding us that film in our post-Einstein quantum-mechanical world of the \\"dynamic\\" comes closer to representing a reality that is always changing, capturing our present experience more accurately than any form that restricts meaning to a \\"Bergsonian, knife-edge instant.\\"<br /><br />But it finally is Siegfried Krackauer's definition of film that brings to film its moral compass while emphasizing the awesome responsibility of the filmmaker. At its best, film has the potential, beyond any other visual form, of being a \\"redemption of physical reality.\\"  The very last words of the film, some of the first from a recognizable public figure, are those of Jimmy Carter, who validates all that we have just seen, providing that final piece of evidence (while satisfying Krackhauer's requirement) that we need to make Argo more than a myth, a story, even a movie.  It's an historical experience, one that has been saved from all the competing \\"noise\\" in politics, war and history to resonate in our imaginations long beyond the lives of any of its participants, creators, and possibly even later participants.<br /><br />Post-script: seeing \\"Argo\\" during the Easter season and in view of Krackauer's contention, I couldn't help but muse over film's redemptive quality in relation to the Incarnation and Resurrection.  Conclusion: film can preserve the miracle of the Incarnation, representing figures who appear to represent a supernatural, or spiritual, ancestry.  It cannot however work in the reverse direction, however, suspending the physical and temporal world of experience for the sake of representing the supernatural.  The same lens that verifies the fleshliness of the spiritual is powerless to demonstrate the spiritual component of the physical world.  In fact, there is no film director, no medium, no church, no creed, no book, no tradition capable of making the case for the divine in the material world.  As Tennyson puts in, \\"There lives more faith in honest doubt than in half the creeds.\\"  Proof of the resurrection, in fact, demands doubt in the evidence of the eye, the ear, the mind--with respect to the existence of the divine the material world is a dark veil of ignorance penetrable only by the individual's spiritual eye of belief.y other visual form, of being a \\"redemption of physical reality.\\"  The very last words of the film, some of the first from a recognizable public figure, are those of Jimmy Carter, who validates all that we have just seen, providing that final piece of evidence (while satisfying Krackhauer's requirement) that we need to make Argo more than a myth, a story, even a movie.  It's an historical experience, one that has been saved from all the competing \\"noise\\" in politics, war and history to resonate in our imaginations long beyond the lives of any of its participants, creators, and possibly even later participants.<br /><br />Post-script: seeing \\"Argo\\" during the Easter season and in view of Krackauer's contention, I couldn't help but muse over film's redemptive quality in relation to the Incarnation and Resurrection.  Conclusion: film can preserve the miracle of the Incarnation, representing figures who appear to represent a supernatural, or spiritual, ancestry.  It cannot however work in the reverse direction, however, suspending the physical and temporal world of experience for the sake of representing the supernatural.  The same lens that verifies the fleshliness of the spiritual is powerless to demonstrate the spiritual component of the physical world.  In fact, there is no film director, no medium, no church, no creed, no book, no tradition capable of making the case for the divine in the material world.  As Tennyson puts in, \\"There lives more faith in honest doubt than in half the creeds.\\"  Proof of the resurrection, in fact, demands doubt in the evidence of the eye, the ear, the mind--with respect to the existence of the divine the material world is a dark veil of ignorance penetrable only by the individual's spiritual eye of belief.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Perfect backpack for travelers. Lots of room and very durable. Laptop and iPad fit perfect into dedicated slots. The sunglass pouch reminds me to bring my sunglasses, something I usually forget when I travel.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|One of my favorite live CDs, I originally purchased the LP when it came out.  To add to all the great reviews of this product, the Enhanced CD content is a great bonus, videos for three songs: Say Goodbye to Hollywood, You're my home and Los Angelenos.  Since it's an old mastering, you need to access the content directly from Explorer/Finder but you can upload these to your iPod or watch them in iTunes without problems.
B0006J28BO|3.0|Not what I expected. I believed it would be a continuation of the story started in Whispers of the heart. Does not come close to Spirited Away or Howls Moving Castle, but its cute.
1609613937|5.0|Presents a clear guide to the reasoning behind a plant based diet.  Wife, Mary provides recipes that are easy to execute, reliable and great tasting.  Highly recommended.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|According to my wife, this is a great album and the songs are super catchy as usual with Taylor Swift albums. Nice work!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|And again' and again.  Beyond a good read, it is a guidebook to life, a simple teaching of seeing the beauty and wisdom in the events of everyday life challenges and victories. Have your marker and notebook ready... eWill have a permanent place in my library

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book held my attention from start to finish.  Lots of twists and turns, love that kind of writing!  Never underestimate the power of a parent's love...
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|this game is fun to play but with no warning it lost all my progress I had made to date.  DO NOT use real money to buy things - you could lose them just as easily.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This soundtrack is really great...  Loved the movie and soundtrack is even better with full songs.  Please don't stop the Music! :)
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie!!! people who don't rate this 5 stars need to watch it again and again until they get it
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Spike is not a cool person and lower coins for special people like Kim in Sydney and the egg thing was not cool because people need to take time to earn it .
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I can't sleep without it! It has plenty of choices to fit my mood and blocks out all the noise around me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thriller and a love story combined LOVE it can't wait to read Catching Fire and Mocking Jay  Love Logger books
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane won an Oscar for best screenplay and has been considered the top movie ever. The movie is really good and tells the life of a media bigwig, Charles Foster Kane, while containing many similarities to the career of William Randolph Hearst. The entire movie is the work of Orson Welles who starred in it as well as wrote and produced it. The only downside is that it is in black and white because it was made in 1941. However, it is well worth watching for the screenplay and the cinematography which was tops for its time.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think that My Little Pony is a great game. My little pony can teach little kids things that other games cant.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|after first awesome version it had to come a follow up. just starting with it, so far so good.<br />the new characters are  ery cool, and many things have been improoved. hours of fun!
B005LFS3ZS|5.0|I was worried about ordering a product that was almost 50% discounted from other places I found it. However, I had no issues, great quality, shipped quickly, and was brand new.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far it is better than other ones I have tried. It was reccomended to me and I just started playing but I like it enough to keep playing
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I  found the stort interesting, exciting and this mixed with romance a great read. The subject of the story is very original and different from what i read before. Every spare minute i just wanted to read on!
B009O2XY12|4.0|Quick and simple game when you need a few minutes to just get away. Higher levels are tough to beat.
0743201140|5.0|What if...knowing the strengths of your team members was central to knowing your customers? What if...at your staff meeting this week, you assured your people that their weaknesses were almost irrelevant?<br /><br />\\"Find out what you don't like doing,\\" says Marcus Buckingham, \\"and stop doing it!\\"  Millions of people have discovered their strengths through Gallup's amazing series of strengths books--this being the first.<br /><br />You're heard this stat a lot--only 17 percent of the workforce \\"play to their strengths\\" every day. That's tragic!<br /><br />Years after this was first published, I'm still amazed at how many leaders and managers have not read this or any of the other books, like [[ASIN:159562015X StrengthsFinder 2.0]] or [[ASIN:1595620257 Strengths Based Leadership: Great Leaders, Teams, and Why People Follow]].<br /><br />The big idea: focus on enhancing your team members' strengths rather than eliminating their weaknesses. The book describes 34 positive personality themes such as Achiever, Developer, Learner and Maximizer.<br /><br />You'll learn how to build a \\"strengths-based organization\\" by capitalizing on the fact that such traits are already present on your team.  The book directs you to a web-based interactive questionnaire developed by the Gallup Organization and you'll instantly discover you own top five strengths.<br /><br />My top five are Focus, Responsibility, Significance, Belief and Maximizer (in that order).  Amazingly, the authors say that less than a dozen people in North America have the same top five in the same order.<br /><br />At your next staff meeting, ask two questions:<br />#1. Recent polls reveal that less than two out of ten people - the actual figure is 17 percent - say they spend the majority of their day \\"playing to their strengths.\\"  Wow! Is that true in our organization?<br />#2. What would happen here if we turned that around--and all of us invested the majority of our day in \\"playing to our strengths?\\"
159562015X|5.0|I can't say that I got a lot out of the book, but I'm sure it is valuable information for those that don't know about these things.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|For a rom-com I enjoyed it.  It's a good date movie and there are several parts worth an out loud laugh.  The acting was well done and made some of the situations really come alive (and hit a little too close to home too).  I wouldn't own it, or see any reason to re-watch it anytime soon.  However I'm glad I finally saw it.  If it was on TV sometime in the future and I was couch-potato'ing I wouldn't turn it off either.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|A wonderful movie and a continuing saga to the earlier books/movies.<br />A wonderful plot and loads of twists that keep you on the edge of your seat!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|As stated earlier, this was fascinating to me to look back at the interior, clothing, and ad design.  I'd forgotten how wonderful our fashions were before the decay of our values as it morphed into the hippy generation.<br /><br />The story line is a good one.  The only draw back was all the seduction scenes; fortunately they don't show every graphic detail.  However,  the total lack of morals was not indicative of everyone in that era.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns as well as secrets to keep your interest.  It doesn't hurt that the lead character is stupifyingly handsome.  You can't get enough of him and want to know more about him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was happily surprised with this game. It's fun and always different enough each time you run it. I would recommend to anyone who wants fun fast paced coin collecting games. Fun boosts to collect and always new items to pick up.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Enjoy the songs and I try to buy his albums.  Got hooked on his music years ago and continue to enjoy them, both past and more current ones.
B0042XA2U4|4.0|I RATED THIS BOOK 4 stars because it is a wonderful story about love, in all its different forms and the tragedy of losing a loved one. This is a book that captures the many emotions that occur when one is struggling to continue living on, when one has lost the very person that they lived for. It is a quick read and a real page turner.
0425263908|2.0|This author is a good writer but I've had the book for a few weeks now and haven't even gotten through even half of its because it hasn't kept my attention. I read the fifty shades of grey series and loved it but this book is,so far, almost the exact same story line so hasnt been very intriguing to me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that it works and is easy to use. It is great onj my eyes and I don't get the eye strain I used to get with other software.
B000006O7C|5.0|I love \\"Grace\\" and was considering buying this one, \\"Sketches (For My Sweetheart the Drunk)\\".  The reviews put me off on doing this.  They made it sound like this was some kind of bad sounding 'demo' tapes or actual musical sketches.  Listening to some versions out on the inter-webs reinforced this too.<br /><br />I should not have listened and bought it already.  WOW!!!!  This is an excellent collection.  Yea, some cuts are kind of rough, and yea, Jeff himself may have not thought they were ready, but yea, they are fantastic, and a lot more ready then what you hear on radio today.  Just the piece \\"Opened Once\\" is worth the price of the CD or MP3s.  Then add the soulful \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" or \\"Back in N.Y.C.\\"; or \\"Nightmares By the Sea\\", one after another of Jeff Buckley's unique voice and sound.  If you enjoyed \\"Grace\\" you will enjoy this.  If you didn't 'get' \\"Grace\\", you will still enjoy this.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this as a distraction game for class (since I always sit in the back of class). It's easy to use and responds well to your movements! Plus, who doesn't like fruit?

B004SOR4H6|3.0|I honestly don't know why I downloaded this, but it works fairly well on the Kindle. Good design and no glitches.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I ordered this amplifier for my dad.  He'd gotten one of the amplifiers that's supposed to look like a cell phone and has a plastic enclosed wire that is molded to hold the thing in position.  It did amplify but he also heard a lot of echo and some feedback noise, making it hard to understand what was said, no matter which little piece that fit into his ear he tried and how he adjusted the volume.  With the Super Ear, he says he can hear and there's not the extra noise that interferes with hearing and comprehending what's said.  A doctor he saw earlier today appeared to be very interested in it and tried listening with it for a few seconds.  Then he wanted to know where we'd gotten it and if it was expensive.  We've only had it since Thursday p.m.  so it's early yet, but so far, it appears to be just what we were looking for.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Loved the twists and turns and cliff-hangers. Acting was a little over-the-top but Affleck did a great job as Director.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Very suspenseful.  Well written.  Just when you think you have things figured out there's a new twist.  They should write a prequel movie to the series.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this book as a coffee table book. A gift for my brother. Its cute and funny. perfect gift. Love it

8866137634|5.0|I'm a college student and having both this and Evernote has let me more opportunities to sketch ideas for projects and interact with my notes on my Mac. The Evernote handwriting recognition is spot on! Reads all of my poor handwriting and makes a genius search tool
B003F1WM2K|5.0|One of the best books I've read. The depth of her emotions was so palpable in her writing that I could feel them leap off the pages and into my soul.  My heart breaks in yearning for a love and life like she had with Robert.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Seriously an amazing movie, the scenery is breathtaking, and captivating. Has many edge of your seat moments. Great sound track, and actors. Just a completely amazing movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is so much fun!!  I love when it changes cities. It is a lot easier to buy new things if you get double coins for just $4.99.  I like beating my high score and competing with my brother.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I bought this for my little one.but finally I love it. I watched it times and times. Its a good story and nice made.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I use this for gaming, Skype/G+ hangouts, and music.  These headphones work great, are comfortable, and while they are not audiophile quality, they are balanced and have enough EQ options to tweak it how you want.  Worth the money.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This story was different than I expected. It followed the progress of the 13th admendment and how different people worked for or against it. Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Since I heard the announcement about the end of Google Reader, I scrambled to find a replacement. Feedly is a very good choice. It synced all my feeds from Reader and seems easier to control the options. I have actually caught up on my feeds for the first time ever! Feedly keeps taking suggestions and making improvements from them. I am very happy with this app.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have been enjoying Downton Abbey and purchased it for my mom as well. We both have watched it multiple times. The stories of so many characters which weave together as history is being made is fascinating.
B004H3WWU2|4.0|just got this bag from amazon. I can put my mac 15\\",  along with all my personal stuff in it, still have room left. love the design of many small divided area inside, help me organize things.<br /><br />let's give it a year, and see how it goes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great story line, wonderful cast and clothes, classy entertainment and a good reminder for using a calm and collected approach to settle matters.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This movie has a great story and some really great acting and special effects. This one you can shut your brain off and just enjoy the entertainment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book i loved this book and i bet i am gonna love the next book also
B005PTYOTE|5.0|I have been wanting the complete collection and this was the best fit to get all the movies at one time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|An easy game to learn, for all ages.  Build the buildings and route traffic to earn money, not sure if there is any leqrning function, but there is a large environmental aspect to the game.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this as a gift along with Cars 2.  It arrived on time, as promised and we are very pleased with it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is awesome- Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond and this is def the best bond movie ever- loved it!
B001HN6922|4.0|My son, who is still a kid at heart, DVR'd this.  I bought it for him so that he can have it to watch whenever he wants.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Yeah twenty words? This is the most twisted thing I have read in years. What happens when you piss off a psychopath? What happens when you piss off your brilliant, amazingly brilliant, wife? And the two are the same person? You get this. The story was well crafted, excellent mechanics, supreme control of the story arc, really hard to put down. The ending? As supremely messed up as it is possible it be.  Yeah read it.
B003YCI1O8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite &#34;horror&#34; flicks.  It is funny and not to scary for young and old alike!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great easy to use app! Never a problem or force close! This calculator has big &quot;buttons&quot; and easy to read and understand lettering/symbols.  I use it every day to calculate bills and balance my accounts.  My grade school kids use it to check their homework.  If you want a basic calculator without the hassle of extra buttons and alt controls...this is the app for you.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I saw the author on PBS and he is a really inspiring person. Good read for anyone, any age. It's a page turner that you can apply to your work and social life. I think anyone can relate to his studies on being happy. If everyone read this book, the world would be a better place.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|this my chemical romance cd is the most  rocking one i own , i like my chemical romance and listening to this cd  it isn't depressing as the other ones this one rocks and i find myself singing along with and head bobbing  and just plain loving it they rock!
B004USRLRS|5.0|I was so happy to hear this album again.  My turntable is old and a pain to use, so I decided to buy CDs of the albums I loved in my college years.  I am having so much fun listening to and singing along with Graham Nash.  I am older now, and can better appreciate the thoughtful and creative lyrics of this wonderful singer and composer.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Thank you for a book that finally explains what I have known instinctively, that wheat makes me sick. My coeliac tests always come back negative but when I am wheat free I have no tummy pain and my health is so much better. Yes, I have been through the mill with invasive investigations and an elective appendicectomy, but the only thing that worked was a wheat free diet. Thank you Dr Davis for making it so obvious and clear, and listing the tests that I know I haven't had done. However, while I am not prepared to go back on wheat to have them done, I can recommend them to others having problems.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Wonderful acting and a beautiful story.  It brings out issues of class structure as well as one's disabilities, which we all have.
B005JZBPHS|1.0|Was late receiving my package wasn't here on the giving date I was told I was very upset about not receiving my package on time
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I think anyone can relate to their aging struggles, as well as struggles with raising teens.  It is a fun movie that made me laugh out loud.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is much more challenging than bejeweled. There is more scheming required to break the jewels and release the pieces needed to complete each board.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Never again will I buy a movie because of the hype.<br /><br />Ignore the top reviewers, they are shills.<br /><br />Was expecting a movie on par with the great classics. not even close.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This game was a lot of fun! Takes your mind off the daily troubles! I put all my energy and thought into it and it relaxed me.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|not to mention the &#34;oh, I knew THAT actor/singer/dancer&#34; moments.  Love, love, love this show!  I knew Katharine was a star the first time I heard her sing!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It was a positive uplifting read,however it felt a bit like I had read many books and watched many romantic comedies that mirrored this. I finished it in less than 24 hours . There was not much to ponder on. I liked Pat . Tiffany was not as defined as I would have liked. It's one of them cute reads. Guess I prefer the darker stuff . If you want something simple,happy, and non offensive...here ya go.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have  read this book countless times and it still never siezes to amaze me. It is adventurous but it also has romance in it. Rick Riordan writes truly wonderful stories combining Greek and Roman mythology with our world today. If you haven't read this book you really are missing out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because you can use different cities on upgrades. I think this is really neat.This is a really neat game. A timekiller.. It doesn't stop or anything. This why I rate it a perfect five. :)
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Wonderful story of commitment!  Loved the part about finding the photo and the journey to find her.  Love this author!
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|Product:<br />The 24k Connector Banana Plugs are a good quality for the price.  If you are looking for a good connection and easy to connect/disconnect, then you should be looking to get some 24k banana plugs.  These plugs are easy to unscrew and work well.  The connectors do not come with instructions on how to connect the wire to the connector which is unfortunate.  But, the quality of the connection is good.<br /><br />One box will be enough for you to connect wire for a 5.1 system.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The packaging is very well done.  The box is small, sturdy with good plastic inserts that keep the plugs from moving around and rubbing against other plugs.  The lack of instructions seems rather odd considering the amount of thought that clearly went into the box and the plastic holder trays.  The packaging is recycleable if that is important to you.<br /><br />Overall:<br />A good product for the price.  You will be happy with this product especially if you have low or mid-range sound system.  The ease of connecting and disconnect speakers is a good thing.  But, you need to make sure your speakers and AV components can use banana jacks as connectors.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Great story. Interesting concept for dialogue.....no quotation marks whatsoever are used, only italics for spoken dialogue. Sometimes that made it difficult to know who was actually speaking in the story. Otherwise it is a must read.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game itself is quite enjoyable. However, it takes many times playing to achieve a higher level and even longer to earn a single &#34;bonus&#34;. I suppose this is so you will purchase additional lives and bonuses, but it doesn't make me want to do that any more than I already did.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|I'd never seen this movie but had heard it was a classic. It was so funny and has made it on my top favorites list. Love the part when they are beating the printer to death.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This series was better than I expected. I've always enjoyed reading books about Henry VIII, his wives, and that era. This series brings it all alive. Highly recommended!!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie would have been a blockbuster, if it had been promoted properly.  It would have helped to tell everyone that the characters were created by the same man who created Tarzan.  But this is better than any Tarzan movie that was ever made.  I love Sci-Fi movies, and personally rank this one among the best.  It has no phasers, no spaceships, but it has an amazing world with amazing culture, swashbuckling action, the right touch of humor, a hero you can cheer for, and an intelligent (not to mention beautiful) heroine.  Watch it once, and you'll watch it again!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|It's Phillip Phillips. What else is there to say? Love his throaty tone. So, so good! Love all the songs.
0374531269|5.0|how it happens, how children are controlled by militias, and understand it from the perspective of an individual who it happened to - this is the book you want.
B002U0KHMY|3.0|Matt Bomer is mesmerisingly pretty, and his character is charming. If that was all a show needed, this would be a great show. I really wanted to love this series, but having watched about four episodes now, I just don't find the storylines all that interesting. I keep waiting for it to get better...so far, it hasn't.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent reading with an unexpected \\"ending\\". Ready for the final book to discover what did in store for Katniss and Peeta.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's good but not as good as WeatherUndergrround.com which I have on my computer.  That site actually logs in data from my neighborhood.  But the Kindle Fire is easier to carry around.
B009L32R5I|4.0|Having enjoyed Genesis' music for 36 years, this was like listening to a live version of the old classics with Steve Hackett's magic touch. Although vocals were different, they were well done and added a new twist.
0062209493|5.0|OVER THE TOP AUDIOBOOK.  WHAT A STORY, WHAT AN AMERICAN HERO!  I met Chris just weeks before his untimely death and I can tell you he was a true American hero and as modest as they come.  Move over John Wayne......
B0011Z33ES|5.0|I have this downloaded album on my tablet, to listen to while traveling. I plan to get more tunes added.
B00BVYLBP2|3.0|Although Orphan Black has enough tension to keep the plot interesting and it's very well acted, I felt the characters weren't that well developed. I didn't get a real sense of who they were, why they did what they did nor did I really like any of them. I didn't care whether they succeeded or failed. The story tended to jump around from scene to scene abruptly without connection between the scenes . This made the story difficult to follow. Still, I may watch one or two more episodes. I found it interesting enough to want to watch at least one more episode.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Fantastic, I have been watching the serie on TV and finally get to see the beggining, strongly recomend it.  Thanks Amazon.
1400049628|5.0|Another book about Zombies! This has a lot of basic survival information and whether its people or zombies this would be great to prepare with.Remember to double tap!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great read, kind of twisty. Not all unexpected, but it did hold some surprises. I wish there was more involvement with the father's history. I actually think a prequel would not be a bad idea. Every time I picked it up, I had trouble putting this book down, even when I should have been working!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have found this game very interesting. I would recommend others to play this game when they have time. There is very good graphics.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I didn't know much about Sheryl Sandberg until I started hearing about her forth-coming book in the blogosphere.  The first few reviews I read accused her of being part of the wealthy elite who attained all of her success not on her merit, but because she was in the right place at the right time.  Other reviews accused her of blaming the victim.<br /><br />I just finished reading the book and before I wrote this review, I read the 1-star reviews which accuse her of primarily the same things.  Interestingly enough the majority of negative reviews are written by men.<br /><br />So, with all of that said... I loved this book.<br /><br />As a woman who climbed the corporate ladder, or 'jungle gym' as Sandberg more aptly describes it, I agree with her 100%.  I have witnessed many of the same behaviors in the workplace that she has witnessed and is now trying admirably to address.  I relate to her many stories of not fitting in, feeling undeserving and at times inadequate and guilty.  I think this topic is something that we as women (and professionally and emotionally evolved men) must embrace.<br /><br />The sad fact is that so many women aren't hearing the true message or reading it for themselves.  I read about one woman who has started a movement of 'lean out' in response to Sandberg's message and frankly, it's baffling.  As I was reading this book, I never got the sense that Sandberg was victim-blaming or encouraging lower income working women and/or single mothers to work harder, longer hours at the expense of their relationships with their kids.  I think that is the guilt speaking.  These women who already feel guilty are finding an easy target in Sandberg.<br /><br />I also never got the impression that she is an elitist.  Yes, as a prominent executive at Facebook she has powerful friends and breathes rarified air but she came across as very human and relatable.  Her problems are problems common to all women and she speaks to them with amazing candor, self-deprecation and humor.<br /><br />I own my own company now and no longer work in corporate America but, as a National Sales Trainer for a Fortune 100 company, I worked with many women in the workplace who leaned back.  I never really understood why.  I always leaned in, even as I was called every name in the book including bitch, arrogant and even ruthless by my 7th grade teacher.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Sandberg makes a passionate plea for equality for women AND men whether they want to stay at home to care for their families full-time or work outside the home.  She gives women on the jungle gym great advice for navigating their career and personal life.<br /><br />I'm happy I read the book to form my own opinion independent of the ignorant blowhards and women content to blame the 'glass ceiling' on their lack of opportunity.  As Sandberg points out \\"opportunities are rarely given; they are seized.\\"<br /><br />I'm firmly on the Lean In bandwagon.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is fantastic!!! You should definitely read it! (Made me cry in the end) Love it. <3 <3 :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story! I enjoyed the way Grisham set up the back story. By the time I got halfway through I couldn't put it down til I finished. It was a book chosen for my book club by another member.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it so much. It's very easy to understand and learn how to play. This game goes up there with the best.
B000063DFS|2.0|Wow.  What happened?  Suddenly Ozzy's songwriting just went down the toilet for this effort.  Even though I've never been the biggest fan of Zakk Wylde's frequently overbearing guitar style, I have actually learned to appreciate his playing on No Rest for the Wicked (and this album too, for that matter) but something went horribly wrong with No More Tears.  It's like Ozzy realized he didn't need to concern himself with top notch songwriting, great guitar riffs and vocal melodies in order to sell an album, because I'll be darned- No More Tears features *none* of the things that I've spent years admiring about Ozzy's music.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" has disturbing sexual-related lyrics but who really cares?  It's the bland straight forward and uncreative way the verse melody and chorus is written that's the biggest reason for its unwillingness to perk my interest, and it's not like the album improves with the follow-up song either.  \\"I Don't Want To Change the World\\" has a *ridiculously* simplistic chorus.  \\"IIIIII don't want to change the world, I don't want the world to change me!\\"  Just terrible.  The verse and chorus both sound the same.  Are they?  Oh but it gets worse- \\"Desire\\" has the worst chorus I've ever heard from Ozzy (well, besides the one from \\"Crazy Babies\\" but that one can just be dismissed as a failed experiment on an otherwise terrific album- No Rest for the Wicked that is).  Never EVER rhyme \\"desire\\" with \\"fire\\".  It's too obvious.  Even then, if the chorus itself included better words I'd still have a major problem with the unforgiveable blandness of the tune.<br /><br />\\"Road to Nowhere\\" is an even bigger insult for all the ballad lovers out there- it's one of the most predictably written ones in Ozzy's career.  Whereas \\"Desire\\" is predictable, a song like \\"Zombie Stomp\\" fails for having one of the worst choruses ever.  \\"Hey hey do the zombie stomp, HEY HEY do the zombie stomp!\\"  Must be Ozzy's way of doing a dance tune.  It fails hard and fast.  I suppose \\"A.V.H\\" is decent enough.  Not sure why exactly- it's just as generic as \\"Desire\\".  Ozzy's vocal melody is more appealing to me on this track at any rate.  \\"Hellraiser\\" is too reminiscent of the generic hair metal scene of the 80's and wouldn't be out of place on a Poison or Motley Crue album.  I consider Ozzy's type of metal in a more inspiring category.  I admit I like Zakk's guitar line in the beginning and included again at the end, though.  The repetitive \\"I can see 'em\\" chorus from \\"S.I.N\\" is unacceptably uninteresting but the song is somewhat redeemed with a decent verse melody.  Still extremely generic.  \\"Time After Time\\" is a better ballad than \\"Road to Nowhere\\".  It's pretty melodic and good enough.<br /><br />For years the semi-chaotic nature of Zakk's guitar playing was a major distraction for me, but I have warmed up to it over the years.  I must be getting generous in my old age!  It was wrong for me to place blame on Zakk's guitar work as the sole reason No More Tears is such a disaster.  It's actually Ozzy's weak songwriting being the biggest factor.  Even with all this said, even recommending No More Tears just because it's coming from a talented and successful heavy metal musician is an impossible task since even in terms of sheer rocking out, the album comes up short in that regard as well.  A must avoid but please *do* pick up No Rest for the Wicked which takes Zakk Wylde's style and combines it with Ozzy's memorable songwriting/vocal melodies.  No More Tears is a rare example where the two biggest hits- \\"Mama I'm Coming Home\\" and the interesting arrangements on the title track that perfectly blends ethereal vocals underneath really heavy and creative guitar work- are the high points.
B000IYU9HW|4.0|Call me sappy but this is still one of my all time favorite movies.  If you like this movie like I do then you might also like \\"youve got mail\\" with meg ryan.  Silly I know but still fun to watch.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It took some time to get the jist of what the problems were but once into it you will really have so think out all the permutations of the various events to make sense of the occurences.  I am not sure of the scientific accuracy of the information provided but it is sure a chilling story.
B00422LESO|2.0|Really not worth anyone's time. Silly and confusing. I think that the author is trying to create a plot similar to pride and prejudice - but did not succeed. Moreover, the main character keeps saying that her journey to Austenland will cure her of men and Mr. Darcy. Not only does it get repetitive, it never made sense in the first place.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is awesome and helps you to understand the part that wheat plays in ruining our weight loss battle.  I tried eating gluten free and lost 27 lbs.  It was just changing the way I eat which gave me more energy.
B00993FEUK|5.0|My grandson has watched this movie again and again. It does contain some scary parts with zombies and witches so beware if your child is frightened easily.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Thought all songs would be as good as &#34;Somebody I Use to Know&#34;, but didn't really like them.  Still, a very good group and Kimbra is someone I'd certainly want to listen to again.  She has an amazing voice.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I decided to read this Volume to catch up on some reading, while we wait for season 4 of The Walking Dead! LOVE IT!!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Enjoying book, but concept of hunger games seems fatalistic regarding humanity.  Still good read and looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I am a Denzel fan, so I chose this to watch one weekend. I usually like more of an escape movie that doesn't make you think too much. This one has a powerful message about life and I really enjoyed the experience of watching it.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|I adored this film!  Once again Cray Grant brings his sex appeal and charm to the film.  I am not a huge Grace Kelly fan but in this she is great!  This film is one of my top five favorite films of all time.  Hitchcock brings all you could hope for and want in a film!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am really enjoying the drama, both for its historical accuracy and lush atmosphere. I will definitely watch Season 3.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Indeed, it is the right gaming mouse for me. amazing price with incredible performance. it comes with 9 fully customize buttons using the software. I really recommend it for FPS and MMORPG gamers.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I was totally hooked on this game until right and the end it all erased. this of course mad me very flipping mad. hope you have better luck.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I could watch this movie anytime of the year if you haven't seen it. It is worth watching. The cast is great, they make you laugh until you cry.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Only read five chapters so far, but am enjoying what I am reading.  I am sure by the end of the book I shall more than &#34;like it&#34;.<br />Jeffrey Archer, true to form, a wonderful story teller.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Everyone keeps giving low ratings because of their own failures.  Uninstall then reinstall and it is updated.  Car mode rocks.  S3
B00B6QXN56|5.0|The best live recording I have listen to in my life . This music is the best thing that I cannot I can't get out of my head .
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great historical fiction with strong character development. Both poignant and fun! Great family viewing. Do yourself a favor and just watch it.  You will be hooked!
B00170I7GG|5.0|Quality was great, no delays, good sound. Subtitles would be really nice! Should probably buy the DVD at this point.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|How can you possibly justify charging $5 for a rental?  Didn't you learn anything from blockbuster? There is a redbox outside...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. It was difficult to take a few times due to the subject matter but I was invested in the characters and really wanted to see where they ended up. I will be looking for new books from this author in the future!
B0083DJWGO|4.0|His thoughts are insightful and eye-opening. I like his philosophy and his style of writing. As he says, this book should be read for pleasure. His unique writing style definitely adds some &#34;taste&#34; to the book. I still think Fooled by Randomness is his best, but this one is a great read, too.
0440423023|5.0|Child has a style that is compelling. From the first page he grabs your attention and never lets go. Interesting plot and although Reacher always remains in character the reader is rewarded by the twists and turns of the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I purchased this game for three of my grandkids and they all like it!  Maybe I should say they LOVE it!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I had a very hard time putting this game away. If it weren't for having to recharge the battery, I would have had even less sleep and housework done. I played all 100 levels in both Zen mode and Timed mode. (which took a couple weeks) I've been tempted to play this yet again, but I've decided to uninstall it so I can get more done IRL.  So if you like match 3 games like Call of Atlantis or the Montezuma series,, you'll probably like this.one too.  ;D
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I sobbed my way through this entire book. Everything ways so good. So perfect. I can't describe my  love for this book and for John green
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just recently downloaded and its a pretty good game so far. Love hidden object games, and the fact that it never ends is great.
1400069807|5.0|Michael Moss puts forth his talent for investigation and clear and descriptive writing in \\"Salt, Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us.\\"  Not only is this book very well organized, presented, and written - it is published at an important time.  I think in recent years more and more Americans (though still are the minority) are not only more aware of what's in the foods we eat, but they are actually doing something about it.  People are making changes in their eating choices and habits.  Another concept that makes this book's timing ideal is the recent promotions and actions of certain city (and other government bodies) regulating and/or banning certain ingredients and foods.<br /><br />Origins and the development of some food corporations are covered in \\"SSF\\" and their attempts to make and provide (sell) the most tasty product to the public.  Numerous laboratories test human taste-buds and preference testing is conducted.  And herein lies the dilemma: the public voluntarily (for the most part) chooses the food it buys and eats.  If some of the salt, sugar, and fat ratio is reduced or is not included in the the item (food) - it does not taste good, and therefore no one buys it, and the product and even company may shut down to a halt.  In addition to the consumers, the government strongly backs the food corporations and food lobbyists more than the consumer-health issue (which is true in all industries and realms of American life when corporations & their lobbyist interests conflict with the individual or public).  Even the processed and canned food labeling, which is a blatant lie and deceit by omission at best - is aided and abetted by the US government.<br /><br />As systematic and methodical as these food giants and their lobbyists are, what responsibility for the morbid American diet is because of - us - the public?  The consumers?<br /><br />Moss did ample research and applied hands-on ground work in 'SSF.'  Numerous pages cite his sources.  He visited company food-laboratories staffed by experienced scientific food creators/makers/tasters/enhancers.  Specific biological details are known about the human taste buds on the tongue and general physiological processes. In these 'food' labs human cravings and limits are understood like DNA testing in a crime lab.  Among the different individuals noted in SSF, is Ulfert Brookman.  With 47 years of scientific experience, he got fired by Kraft and later won a legal settlement.  This reminds me of the whistle-blowers who expose poor maintenance on air liners in order to prevent deaths, but they are drummed out of the industry with their careers ruined.  The story of Jeff Dunn is depicted by Moss. Dunn is a former marketing whiz at Coke who left the company and now promotes 'bags of carrots' using the same marketing methods.<br /><br />We are aware of why processed foods have increased so vastly in our eating culture.  American society went through significant and well-known transformations:  In sum, we have less time.  A large percentage of women are in the workplace now and have less time and energy for home-cooking, which was in previous generations a role primarily held by women.  The average commuting time in America has increased annually.  Working hours are longer.  Less time and less energy to shop for natural and healthy ingredients, prepare and cook a meal, and clean up afterwards.  Obviously, cooking is work.  A lot of work.<br /><br />On another related note to what I call the \\"morbid American diet\\" - yes, it is killing us - is that in addition to salt, sugar, and fat we have: high fructose corn syrup (HFCs), nitrates, aspartame, food coloring, and chemicals I still don't know how to pronounce.<br /><br />On the marketing angle, which is integral to our processed food mainstay, brand loyalty begins at or around the age of 12, and marketing is the art/science juxtaposed with the food scientists in the taste labs. Interesting, yet not surprising is how marketers placeparticular processed food items on eye-level locations of shelves, while certain items are at your feet at the bottom.<br /><br />With the current rise in diabetes, and obesity, and with heart disease still the number #1 killer in the US, I only see more ill people and more premature deaths because of the food we eat.  It's a cycle.  I am part of it.  I've known for years that much of the processed foods are loaded with sodium.  You cannot taste it, but it's there.<br /><br />My grandfather, who was a great cook, used to tell me, \\"we dig our graves with our knife and fork.\\"<br /><br />Michael Moss gives us a greatly needed book backed by facts to further this discussion and needed actions in our society.  Highly recommended.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This is one of those movies that when ever it was on cable I would stop surfing and watch.  I found myself watching it so often that I thought it was time to buy.  Hilarious!!!
B006NXIO0Q|1.0|Not every film can be an academy award winner, but this was not very good.  In fact, I can't recommend it at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good game so says my daughter, she plays it on her tablet.  She tried the demo first and would not leave me alone until I broke down and got this for her.  Clean game and some inteligence behind it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've read the books; watched the show, and enjoying season 3.  Feeling greedy, but want more - books and shows.  Love everything about this storyline.

B000FC146C|4.0|I loved it in the 70's and loved in 2013!  The only thing that drove me crazy about the kindle version was the exorbitant typo's!!
B0087EACJK|5.0|I don't know what it usually costs to buy the game, but I've played maybe 10 of the levels, and they weren't all intuitive, and took a couple times to get all of the items within the time allotted.<br /><br />My boys think it looks like fun, though I think they haven't tried it yet.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I really like this game! It plays like space invaders but better. Very intuitive and very fun. Highly recommends by me
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is the first app that I've seen that actually makes it possible to do sudokus on the computer - I'm not a fan of writing down every single number in a box, and so have a method that I place numbers in certain places on paper sudokus.  I can't do the placement thing with this app, but the method of writing down the pencil marks is pretty tolerable.<br /><br />I finished a number of standard sudokus, and then downloaded the &#34;wild, nightmare&#34; ones, or whatever they are called.  They are really hard...  I like hard ones, and typically everything you find in the paper is too easy, but these are really tough.<br /><br />I also like the different variations with the extra clues that those variations give - it is harder to keep the colors and shapes correct, but make for an enjoyable version as well.
1743117094|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns that just when you think you have it figured out - it takes off and changes again.  I loved it so much that I bought 3 more of her books.  Haven't read them yet but am looking forward to it if they are a trying like this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I hadn't heard of Temple Run (1) before, but this was a free-app-of-the-day, and so I tried it out.  TR2 has become our favorite game, and my son and I typically haven't been playing any other games lately.<br /><br />It is quite challenging, and sometimes it feels like one needs to purchase stuff with actual dollars to make it through, but we've always come through it without paying extra...  (sorry Mr Author - I know you'd like our money....)<br /><br />We've bought most things that can be bought, though still have a couple left (saving 50K coins is hard...)<br /><br />There is enough variation, and the speed can get quite fast, and so the game is still fun after all this time playing it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best free game out there! I can have fun playing this for minutes or hours. Even my 2 year old has fun playing this!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie is about an hour too long, the punchlines though realistic are not very realistically funny.  My wife and I like watching couples movies, but steer clear of this one.  The characters are predictable, every faux pas of a middle aged couple was used, but poorly.  I wanted the husband to grow a pair and the wife to quit being so whiny.  I wouldn't have watched it all the way through if not for the fact that I paid so much for this rental from amazon.  A WASTE OF MONEY!
B00881PPTO|3.0|A Kayak app's option to search for cheaper tickets with up to plus or minus 2 days flexibility is better than other similar apps. This pro version with no ads is great but somehow, when I try to use Price Alert, the app crashes. So I downloaded and installed free one with ads from google play which works fine.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This book was such a wonderful story I wish I could read more from this auther. I love his ability to get inside of people and describe thier thinking and felings.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book is AMAZING Theo gets accused and has to figure out a way to get his named cleared .
B000GJ0KOG|4.0|A very endearing story about acceptance and understanding that was turned into a Broadway Musical! Both are great to watch!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A bit challenging, but should come with some instruction.  SOme things I didnt know at first made the game much harder than it should have been.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|This is one of the best Horror movies I've seen in a long time! It has a good story line. It brings you into the movie. The special effects were awesome. You get to see Mama, up close and personal! I almost jumped out of my seat at one part and started laughing because I couldn't believe I did that. I have been waiting for a decent and different Horror movie to come out and this is definitely the one. The ending is very unusual also, but that is all I'll say about that. Definitely Worth Buying!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive but fun! I love racking up coins & beating my friends off facebook! I think its a gray game for kids
B000BF0D9M|5.0|If you enjoy Jesse Cook's Rhumba Flaminco music, you will love this set............ I do<br />I particular in joy it in the car with an open road.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game it keeps you concentrated and its kind of addictive. You get to update it a few times. I have experienced the New York, Rome and now Sydney. I dot find Sydney very fun as it is a black train. Rome was a good one but the town will soon change. If you are bored and need something to do then just download this free game and play it. I play by the missions. My highest score is 2108 coin in a run in Rome. Can YOU beat me? There's only one way to find out download the game.
0786860707|5.0|My wife has been a lifelong lover of Disney animation. When she was a kid she wanted to be a Disney animator. We have two kids and so she has had to put that dream on hold - but when she opened her birthday presents and saw this was among them in addition to many other Disney books, she started crying. She thinks this book is absolutely beautiful and really allows her to read and become a part of all that Disney animation she has loved for so long. I thoroughly recommend this if you are or have a Disney lover in your life.

B00BYOEZTI|5.0|Best LOTR film yet.  The liberal story additions are at first a stretch, but eventually fit in nicely.  Read the book a half dozen times, and there were times that I thought, &#34;Exactly as I had imagined it all those years ago.&#34;
B00ABMZRVO|3.0|Too bad that everything in this movie isn't as good as the acting! While the male lead actors are quite believable, the movie suffers mostly from a lack of character development and a rather uneventful storyline. From watching the film, I couldn't figure out what Paul was all about. The script doesn't ever shed any light on what his demons are that fueled his drug addiction. It's revealed that Paul stresses over the responsibility and workload of his job, but who doesn't? And any stress from him being a closeted gay male is not really explored in any depth, so I really have no clue why he was strung out. There was also no clarity on why Erick didn't want to remain with Paul after he seemingly got himself straightened out--something Erick had long hoped for. As a result, the final scene felt \\"lifeless\\" and \\"emotionless\\", because I really didn't get a sense of who they actually were as people or even why they were bonded in the first place.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Best bond since Moonraker.  Perhaps ever.  Features an actual logical reason for the freakish disfiguration of the exotic vilian.  Closing sequence was very intense.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Didn't like being left hanging at the end. I hope she writes another installment to the series. I read all 3 books in less than 2 weeks
B00BF123WG|4.0|Like the fact that this remains politically neutral...a great story that needed to be told.  The last 20 min were excellent film making.
B001EBROWQ|1.0|It was the lousiest movie with respect to the live of our Saviour that has ever been made.It was filmed in a hurry,did not keep a true sequence of events.
B00BHMF578|2.0|Another film about how america is evil and it's our fault that office workers at an embassy are attacked, tortured, and held captive for a couple years.  It's as if, by the end of the film Affleck wants us to feel (as he does), \\"Those noble muslims, us evil infidels deserved it!\\"
B004I744AS|5.0|Never tiring and fun way to learn new words history and interesting bits of information. You will see something new each time you open the ap. It will stretch your mind.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great film, slow in the beginning but great action through out the rest of the film! More cgi than the lord of the rings but not in a diminishing way. Loved it!
B005544V6A|5.0|The chemistry between Mike and Harvey is great. Can't wait to see what happens next with Rachel.<br />Loved seeing Jessica and Harvey go head to head.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Honestly best book I've ever read and nothing like I've ever read either! Loved John Green's style of writing too. I am 16 years old and I loved this.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  The little ones love the colorful scene but it is a little too fast paced for a toddler. Buyer beware, this game is addictive and you may end up spending more money on in-app purchases to buy Hello Kitty and all her friends.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|One of many treatments of the original Lewiss Carroll material that combines parts from Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and leaves a lot out. If you know the books well, you can test yourself by seeing how much of them were quoted exactly.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Im not entirely sure what this game was all about, besides having horses. I never could figure out what you are supposed to be doing.  If you are patient and really, really love horses you might like it. idk
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome, exciting game. You will love it if you get it.<br />I totally would recommend it.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|DD loves the Dr. Panda games. This one is probably the one with the least activities.  She played it for a few days and went back to the other Panda games. Its ok for a toddler.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive, all members of the family now competing against each other, even those that are 300 miles away!Beware once you start playing you can't stop!!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|This is an easy way to touch the touch screen on a kindle fire.<br /><br />(Oh. And my name is Carter L Sullivan).
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Delving behind the scenes of our extrovert-friendly culture reveals another world where quiet thought, pause and reflection contribute another variety of good to the world. This book will change the way I raise my child, interact with friends, the way I manage and lead and even help me embrace my introverted side. A must read!
B00BXRFCFM|5.0|This is the best album that Bring Me The Horizon has made so far. Buy it! There is no regrets here!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Murder mysteries with many complications and well-written characters and action make this series page-burners.  Could not put them down even in the wee hours.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works great for me. I can read the books I want. I would recommend it. very good reader. thanks
B001NLKT60|5.0|Murder mysteries with many complications and well-written characters and action make this series page-burners.  Could not put them down even in the wee hours.
B000E5N684|4.0|Both the regular and the direcor's cut are quite raw.  I expected even more from a &#34;director's cut.&#34;  Sems like only a marketing ploy.
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|I love the music and its really fun to challange friends to beat your high scores. buy is you like fast paced puzzle challenges.
B008N9AASC|5.0|I chose this because of my love of Baraka, the DVD I have told everyone about, and getting it this way was cost effective on a fixed income
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book was very good.  i got it because in class we were reading it and there weren't enough copies for us to bring home.  I loved following the story of Buck and his hardships.  He is taken from his home and is forced to work as a sled dog, learning important lessons along the way.  This book is good for anyone wanting to read a heartwarming story about a dog finding his inner primordial beast in the Yukon region of Alaska.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this one, it's creepy and entertaining! The puzzles and hidden objects were not too easy and gave the game the right amount of difficulty.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It's a good movie. Its what it says it is. The iron man really makes it a good movie. Has a lot of violence but what doesn't and some cursing but i guess everything does
B00ABD0SW6|5.0|Fun to watch with great actors. I love it and think you will too.  Season 2 is even better than season 1. Now if I can only get my wife to watch.
0465022227|4.0|I am a PhD student who is going to graduate in a year. I feel lucky I bought some books on how to survive in academia. \\"A PhD is not enough\\" is the second book I read. The first one is \\"From student to scholar\\", which I believe you also have heard about. If I have to give a ranking, I choose the \\"From student\\" one as the best (in various academic survival books).<br /><br />This book certainly is good. It is short and informative. I have learned a lot.<br /><br />But I think the author of the book is a little cynical. Many people like the way the book is written. But I think the book conveys some negative emotion which is not very good for a PhD student who is eager to start an academic career. For example, in Chapter 6 'From here to tenure: choose a career path', the author gives a long list of the disadvantages of being a professor in a university. I sense that the author particularly hates teaching. He mentioned many times how stressful and boring teaching is. The author also talks about how wonderful working in a national lab is. I notice that the author himself is a scientist in a national lab but not a professor. That perhaps can explain why he likes national labs instead of universities.<br /><br />But after all, it is also good to be aware of all kinds of disadvantages of professorships. After all one needs to get well prepared to pursue a professorship.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun my child loves it as much as I do<br />we play it at least twenty-five minutes a-day
B001IYD482|5.0|A simple idea, but it can really impact any fan of superhero movies.<br /><br />The film was the best of phase 1 of the Marvel movies, which had more action, more destruction, because superhero film without destruction, is not a good movie genre!<br /><br />big mistake not having released more films of this franchise and an even bigger mistake was Ed Norton have given up on returning to the role for sure after he witnessed the success of the movie The Avengers, should really have hit his head on the wall .. . lost the opportunity to earn lots of money and have more career achievements! ...<br /><br />This issue has to be on your bookshelf!
0765325950|5.0|The book is great to bad the story has to end, once I've finished reading this one I'm going to sit down & start reading from the start with no waiting for the next book to come out. But yes it gets my 5 stars & more.<br />Aloha, Jenica Truax
B0011WL8MK|5.0|Much more than 33 words are required to treat this curious film properly. As WW2 anti-Nazi propaganda it's rather a masterpiece. Jack Benny, says me, gives his greatest film performance. The film is important.
B00005V9IL|3.0|A dilemma.  The first time I saw this movie I loved it.  Unfortunately, with each subsequent viewing familiarity bred discontent.  This latest viewing did me in.  I finally took notice of how stale the dialog was with its overuse of colloquialisms.  We're introduced to a slew of characters under a storm of unpleasantness (made all the worse because it takes forever before they dig themselves out and into the realm of decency).  A lot of domestic dirt is slung without examples to back it up.  Michael Biehn's one-note psychotic had nowhere to go but down (I couldn't believe they actually (unsuccessfully) lobbied to get him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor!).  The movie is untidily divided into long belabored sequences; you can practically see the chapter headings.  And as far as the last flight into fantasy, all I could think was the fate of the world rested on the ability of Virgil Bud (Ed Harris) to act as the emissary representing Earth's interest!?  \\"Howdy.\\"  Part rosy feel good optimism, part scolding, how is one to take that over the rainbow ending?<br />I will admit there was still some sporadic enjoyment to be had this time out, but that just isn't enough.  Now comes the debate, do I want to keep it to watch again in the all too distant future?
B00003CXA6|2.0|This dvd came in good timing, great condition but the movie itself sucks, I was hoping for a great history story but Gettysburg is a long drawn out, bad acting re-enactment.
B007N85POS|5.0|I like it so much that I cannot stay away from it. As you get deeper and deeper into the levels the harder it gets
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Dorian Gray is a great story for anyone, this is a good Kindle edition and can't wait to live the adventure again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have a son who had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a teenager, so I was really interested in this book as a learning experience.  Also, because all of the recent mass killers have untreated mental issues, I thought readers could become educated about a mental health issue that is often called the silent disease - TBI.  While our politicians are fighting over gun control, and the media talks of nothing else, the mentally ill, are being ignored by the public and sometimes even their family (look at the father in this story).  The families of these people often seek help, where, unless you are very rich, there is none.  It should be clear to every reader of this book, that the man who has recently left the psychiatric hospital has a lot of deficits, including, but not limited to: memory loss and  poor insight into his deficits (anosognosia).  He will probably will never be able to live on his own without supervision.  He has to rely on his mother to tell him when to take his meds, buy his clothes, etc., and he is obsessive (over the lifting weight and running thing), all symptoms of what can happen when one suffers a TBI.  I was disappointed that we never know what actually happened to him when he was able to live on his own, have a career and a marriage.  He just says his wife left him because he was a bad husband.  Again, poor insight and magical thinking because he feels she will come back to him at some point.  The public needs more information and education on mental disorders, so they can press our government for help, and get themselves out of denial, ex: Adam Lanza's mother in Connecticut. In respect to these important issues, the author let his readers down and mmissed a great opportunity to educate, as well as entertain.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always like the read the book before I see the movie and this was no exception.  The book was great.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie. Funny with great music and relatable characters. The acting was good. Im a big fan of Glee, so I don't mind a lot of singing, but this actually had less than I thought. Really enjoyed it :)
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It's easy to navigate, and I can update my profile really easy. I really like how I have access to news in all the different industries.
0062238868|1.0|I can't believe this book has gotten so many positive reviews. The book is utter garbage. It is poorly written by some uneducated brainwashed individual. I could not even finish it because it was very boring, stupid and demented.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loved this game as a teenager and its still exciting as simple as it is. It was worth buying the full game.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love to play pinball and this app lets me feel like i'm playing the real thing.  thanks a bunch
B0090EHVMC|3.0|For some reason I was expecting more out of this movie. Couldn't put my finger on what it was missing for me.
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|But, he should have tried a little harder at making this good. ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I was expecting the story line to go as I had imagined when I was a kid, but it had new story by line in areas that just keeps you watching.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Este libro para mi  y mis hermanas es muy útil por la escuela<br />Nos piden qué lo llevemos todos los días gracias por este libro
144937980X|5.0|This book has opened up a whole new world for me to explore. Well written and easy to understand. Fascinating.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like it a lot but you cant join multiplayer so im giving it 3 stars sorry it is still fun though
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Nice and pure rock album from the Foos .  Follow the instructions and crank your volume for the best results.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Ah, this book is intense. I couldn't put it down. I watched the movie first and of course the book is much better. Loved every word.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|My husband and I have been fans of the Muppets since our children were little.  This was one of our family's favorite Christmas movies.  Even though our children are grown and married now, my husband mentioned this movie during Christmas.  I decided to see if it was still available.  I was able to order it and surprise him with it.  Even though it is after Christmas, we have still watched it  a couple of times and enjoyed Michael Caine and all the Muppet characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's an awesome game. Crazy to think we used to need a clunky box wired to one of those giant dinosaur tv's just to play a game like thid
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this season. This season shows the characters in a new light. The sets and costumes are amazing as always Would recommend to anyone!!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  Deffinently show where Lord of the rings started amd kinda gives you an idea of what is gonna happen throughout the movies.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was so engrossed thinking about the ending of this book and the ... twist ... that I stopped at a green light driving to work!  Can't say anything else without giving it away! Great suspense novel.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have always been interested in Broadway Musicals. This movie had more depth than the play, but there was something missing, maybe because the movie was filmed mostly in the &#34;dark.&#34;  All of the songs were sung &#34;live&#34; rather than dubbed later. Ann Hathaway really had her hair cut live for the movie.<br />It is interesting that we see movies made into Broadway Plays, IE Grease, Disney's films etc. Again the reverse is true. Chicago, Phantom of the Opera. Mama Mia and Rent to name a few were made into Movies. Some were okay others were true to the play it came from.<br />I believe Les Mis was by far one the best movie made from a play. Next would be Phantom, Rent, A Chorus Line and The Producers..
B008220D5K|1.0|This movie was a HUGE disappointment.<br /><br />I wish movies touted as \\"comedies\\" were actually funny.  The trailers made the movie look funny, however, there was not one laughable moment in this movie... and I'm pretty easily amused.<br /><br />DO NOT waste 134 minutes of your life watching it.  It was painful to watch.  I truthfully didn't even care how it ended.  I made myself watch it though the end though, and it was very anti-climatic.<br /><br />What a disappointment and waste of time.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|Just saw the Grand Canyon 3D, and the scenery is spectacular.  But, the commentary, background music, the 'native Indian' guide, etc. is way too NPR'ish.  I was literally cringing. And I love NPR, voted for Obama, etc. So..... what can I say, but, hey guys lighten up please.  Every single cliche was there.  Dave Matthews groaning in the background,  the banjo playing down the river, the earnest environmentalist with (of course) his equally as earnest college age daughter in tow, the somber commentary of Robert Redford,  the female Indian guide talking about (wait.... yes, leave for her kids, etc.), and mid way thru, the cherry on the sundae, Bobby Kennedy Jr.<br /><br />Again, scenery great, too bad we can't have an alternative narration, somewhere along the lines of the HBO documentary narrators. Yeah, I do want to save the river, and yes there is stupidity to how we are wasting our resources, but it is all compromised by this cliche ridden garbage.  Stop the preaching and let the facts speak for themselves.
B00BV2M9LO|3.0|The plot and concept are quite good, however the dialog, descriptions and characters are awful. I'm a fan of some of the Lee-Preston books and expected more from Preston. He was given a great Crichton  outline, something other writes would kill for, and ruined it. It really reads like he wrote it in a weekend. This would make a great idea for a movie, and is worth a read for Chrichton's scientific lesson on what life in the microscopic world would be like.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Watching this was the closest thing we could ever know of what it would have been like to meet this amazing man and be in the room watching how he made history.  It's not a biography or a story about the Civil War.  Minimal violence except to set the stage for the greatest moment in Lincoln's life, Presidency, and in American history.  Could be shown in school classes because it's much more interesting this way than to just read and hear about it.  I found it very moving and have taken a great interest in learning more about Lincoln.  Thank you Daniel Day-Lewis for bringing him to life, and to Steven Speilberg for making this movie great.
B000001DQI|5.0|One of the best! Elton at his finest. I will never tire of the classics this album has to offer.
159420411X|4.0|In the movie 'The Graduate', Dustin Hoffman's character is given career advice in the form of one word, 'plastics'. If a remake of the movie were to be done in present times, that word might just be 'statistics'. Nate Silver embodies this worldview and through a hodgepodge of disparate but interrelated vignettes he explores how statistics and probability play out in such areas as sports, economics, chess, poker, climate, politics, and terrorism. He is an admitted bayesian, a follower of the probabilistic approach based on the works of the 18th century reverend and mathematician Thomas Bayes, and a proponent of thinking like a fox as opposed to thinking like a hedgehog. While hedgehogs have one defining ideology or model of the world, foxes have multiple competing models, and using Bayesian probability, constantly update their predictions when new data comes in. Bayesian probability is based on subjective predictions, not on objective statistical distributions like those found in the frequentist school founded by Fisher, a 19th century biologist. It remains to be seen whether the bayesian approach is the 'true' way, but it certainly does seem more effective in practice. Silver spends a lot of time delving into the nuances of each of the example fields he explores, with just enough detail to offer insightful commentary without overwhelming the lay reader with advanced mathematics. In an increasingly unpredictable and complex world, Silver gives us a glimpse of the skills necessary to wrangle the messy reality which we find ourselves living in.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As an engineer, I have worked in a male dominated environment for 20+ yrs. In this book, Sheryl describes many scenarios that I've encountered.  I found the studies that she cites enlightening.  I have always found it difficult to Sort out gender biases from merit biases and now I have better understanding of why that is the case. She also does an excellent job of giving suggestions for how to deal with different situations.  I wish I had this book 20 yrs ago!  I've just sent this book to my daughter who is in the military.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Love the page transition scroll feature and the articles are geared to my intrests. Would suggest for anyone wanting a great replacement for Goggle reader.
6305428352|5.0|Great movie to show youth, showing how one person can make a huge difference in the thier community  Need more of these role models in our lives
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app. its my go to anytime I want to know the weather. highly recommend it. just got the new update and it made it even better.
B00AEFXOKO|5.0|Great movie to share with youth as a prompt to discuss the ethics of community. There are not enough Coach Carters in the world
B00BHMF578|4.0|Kept me at the edge of my seat. The ending was nerve racking. Ben Affleck is not only a talented actor but also a talented director.
B002HFP0QU|2.0|What I should of bought was the original best of the Bee Gees recorded in the late 60s. I have that on vinyl just couldn't figure out how to rip it onto MP3. It reminded me how much I love their old stuff and really didn't care too much for their disco era Tunes. They had to do what they had to do, switching from their classics songs over to disco. Just shows how talented those boys Really were. The MP3 showed up immediately on my phone and iPad with the rest of the MP3s. I have been lucky, Not having to wait for the CD before the MP3 is sent, Like some of the Customers. I received all my MP3s right away after purchasing auto Rip CD. I am extremely happy with that service.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This Story Has Romance  Suspense and a Great Story  Thanks To My Book Club  And My DaughterI I Have Found Another Author That I Can Count On For a Great Read  The Twists and Turns In This Story Have You Wanting More  Great Beginning And  Ending
B00138CYD4|3.0|I've had most of these songs on different albums or CDs, It's just nice to have them all in one folder on my iPad And cell phone. And at the time it was on sale at price I couldn't refuse. Just trying to fill in a nice little collection of music. The MP3s showed up immediately on both my cell phone and iPad. Can't get any easier than this.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|I thought the acting was acceptable, but the movie dragged a little and the &#34;love&#34; that developed between Helen's and John's character was implausible and untrue, according to what really happened.<br />Why does Hollywood always have to alter the real story and make everything a romance?
B0065CCM76|4.0|I already owned the original Bob Seger's greatest hits, But that was missing just a few songs. So I thought I'd pick this up and fill-in my blanks. It's a decent album and I like the songs but I could've done without it, And just ripped my original. But if you're a Bob Seger fan and don't already have his original album this makes for a great CD/ MP3. Sometimes Amazon just seems to make it a little too easy.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I purchased Downton Abbey Season 1 and 2 because I had missed season #1.  Both were offered at the same time so took advantage of purchasing both of them.  I feel they are both a great addition to my library.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was wonderfully written! It was full of happy and sad moments but i would give this book a 5 out of 5!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I originally saw the movie at the Galaxy.  I knew then that I would need to add this particular movie to my library.  I have not been sorry.  The story is wonderful.  Having lived in the south years ago I know how some people can treat others.  What that women did for the main character was truly spectacular.  She makes you stop and think that when you have so much it is time to share.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|Enjoying this album.  I see it as a blend of modern blues/rock with an atmospheric/country quality.  There's not a genre that this record would fit neatly into.  Especially enjoy \\"ride on/right on\\" for its fun vibe.  \\"Song for Zula\\" quotes \\"Ring of Fire\\", interesting use of trumpets on several tracks, there are lots of things to keep you listening over and over.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use Google on my laptop so I love the app.  I am glad I installed the app.  Google search is a good product.
B006ZS7ZLS|5.0|The best album i have bought in years. Needs to be longer, though.  I can not wait for lana del rey's next lp.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|not enough info to access  to understand game. building houses is  vague. I would not buy again...game will not allow you to move fast enough.
0316017930|5.0|If you like his stuff, you'll enjoy the book.  You know what you're getting.  This is one of my favorites from Gladwell.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Really cool, but the seam lines are kind of bothers me. Sound is a bit quiet and the nib of the pen comes off easier than the cap. Cap hiding the screw can come off if you aren't careful but it's still a great product and I'm planning on getting the 11th doctor's screwdriver.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is one of those books that you will either love or hate.  I loved the book, the authors style of writing was great, just enough action and then back into the story. It kept me wanting to read more to find out what was next, and sometimes it's not what you think it's going to happen next!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Get the book if you have women/daughters in your life or you are one.<br />Can't read this book straight through.  Spent 20 yrs in military and 4 at Service Academy.  This book had memories flowing.  Had to read this by the chapter to let the thoughts flow and surface.<br />Already put this book into action by not accepting shoddy treatment at car dealership.  Treated poorly because we were women.  48 hrs into asking for estimate and keeping car hostage, still no car.  Let's say the power of the critique (only 178 letters) is a powerful tool.  Although I only got to Chapter 4, I left my first copy with my niece and her SILs.  Her favorite statement was 'That's okay!'  Not so!  So I'm buying on Kindle so I can highlight things that really get my mind engaged.<br />BTW, the car dealership owner and service mgr took immediate action from my national level critique and my niece's huge bill was made less than 50%. At one point in our mtg, this man offered to run to Costco to get the baby diapers we needed.  The Service Mgr agreed with me that the terrible treatment we received wouldn't have happened if we were men. He also stated we wouldn't have gotten the car back that day if I hadn't ordered the service rep to send the shuttle to pick us up and filled out the critique.  BTW, I had to fly later that day and service rep knew that when we dropped off car.<br />Everyone who wants the best for females should read this book.  Very powerful.  A MUST READ
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've tried them all &amp; love these gentle sounds; all with independent volume control to mix your ultimate soothing experience! I cannot go one night without it.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game since it's free and has A LOT of levels.  The only thing that I don't like about this game is that there isn't many hints given so if you're stuck you will just have to skip the level!
B00BF11STU|4.0|The movie kept turning off and I was unable to see the complete movie at least half was seen. I would like to see the complete movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I played this game on the free version when I first got my kindle fire. It was great and I knew I'd be back to play the entire game. I' 'll be purchasing this game and most likely a lot more games from G5. - D
B0034G4P94|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift. I had already seen this movie...it was a good movie and would see it again. My brother enjoyed it very  much.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|The CD is great (this is the second copy I have purchased).  The first one ended up as a gift.  However, the jewel case for this copy was broken in two places.  I'm surprised the CD survived unscratched.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is a wonderful series and the characters are so interesting. Each show is a stand alone show, so you do not necessarily need to watch them in order. It has consistantly been a great series over the years and I always enjoy seeing how each character develops for the next season. Loved E J Barrett--bring her back for more episodes please!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|It made me write this . Pretty good thought . Still not very happy about this . All animals are cute but doesn't work well.

B005LAII3A|3.0|After twenty years, it was probably inevitable that Hollywood would remake \\"Total Recall.\\"  Sadly, the remake version of \\"Total Recall\\" isn't nearly as good as the original -- a giant chunk of the plot has been jettisoned (goodbye, Mars! Farewell, mutants!) and so has most of the humor and character development. Taken on its own merits, it's a decent enough sci-fi thriller, with some outstanding special effects and a solid (if underdeveloped) performance by Colin Farrell.<br /><br />On impulse, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment. But things instantly go very wrong -- a SWAT team bursts in and kills the Rekall employees, and on instinct Quaid kills all of them. When he runs home in a blind panic, his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) also tries to kill him, and reveals that she isn't even really his wife.<br /><br />Quaid goes on the run, with only a few cryptic messages and a mysterious safe-deposit box to guide him. But as Lori and the police chase him through the Colony (Australia) and the the United Federation of Britain, he meets a woman (Jessica Biel) who knows him from the past he can't remember -- and might help him bring about a new future.<br /><br />Anyone expecting a straight remake of \\"Total Recall\\" will be disappointed -- no Mars, no Bennie, no Kuato, no mysterious terraforming engines, and a good chunk of the plot twists have been removed. Oh, and no mutants... well, except for the famous three-breasted woman, whose third breast is never explained because we never see another mutant of any kind.<br /><br />No, this movie is grimly determined to be dark, gritty and \\"realistic,\\" depicting a  future where the world has been devastated into near-unlivability, and only Australia and a portion of Europe are still semi-normal. It's an intriguing idea, and it is handled in a fairly plausible way... well, except for the giant gravity elevator zipping through the Earth's mantle. That seems far-fetched.<br /><br />Len Wiseman is at his best with the action scenes -- big explosive battles involving magnetic cars, killer robots and bombs, as well as a lot of people shooting at each other. And the future societies are intriguingly-depicted -- either they're grimy, murky cyberpunk mazes (think \\"Blade Runner, but less pretty) or cold sterile technohaunts. In fact, the movie could really use some moments of humor or warmth, but neither ever appears.<br /><br />Also... what is with the lens flare?

B00C2IJJF0|1.0|\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.<br /><br />This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of 300, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.<br /><br />A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...<br /><br />... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.<br /><br />Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue (\\"It is death who should be afraid of us!\\") and dozeworthy action scenes.<br /><br />Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us (\\"God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him\\") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of \\"We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!\\"... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.<br /><br />And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums, and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information -- a complete waste.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" would be better titled \\"Flush of the Titans\\" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.g their own theological philosophy on us (\\"God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him\\") NON-STOP.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|Like everyone else in the world, I instantly went cross-eyed at the idea of Guy Ritchie making a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Sure enough, this is not your dad's Sherlock. Or your grandpa's either. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is a thoroughly eccentric take on the legendary detective -- energetic, action-packed and clever, with more than a hint of steampunk and black magic. It gets kind of silly at times, but Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law keep the story going strong.<br /><br />As the story opens, a young woman is about to be sacrificed in a black magic ritual by the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). However, Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) thwart him just in time for the police to arrive. Three months later, Blackwood is executed -- but not before he tells Holmes that three more people will die, and the world will change.<br /><br />But then his tomb is broken open... from the inside. And at the same time, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to hire Holmes to track down a man who is then found dead in Blackwood's tomb. As Holmes tries to unravel this case, he discovers the existence of a strange upper-crust magical cult, who are slowly being killed off by Blackwood's mysterious powers. Has Sherlock Holmes run up against supernatural forces he cannot explain or fight?<br /><br />This is not an adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories -- this is more a movie that takes the IDEA of Sherlock Holmes and applies it to a big, bombastic, quirky action movie. Ritchie directs the movie with a sharp, kinetic style, and he keeps things from getting too stuffy with lots of fight scenes (including Holmes mapping out every fight in his head before throwing a punch).<br /><br /> His steampunky vision of London has a lot of dark, dripping corners, and Ritchie happily trots Sherlock and Watson down into them -- river boats, Parliament's basement, and grimy rituals down in some catacombs. The movie's biggest problem is that the action sometimes gets silly, such as the massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\"). This is definitely a movie that loves Holmes at his most eccentric.<br /><br />The main reason this works so well is because of Downey. He is probably one of the best actors of our age, and he gives Sherlock a bright-eyed, quirky, almost manic energy, as well as a touch of Asperger's (he literally CANNOT understand why Watson would want to get married and retire from crimefighting). You can truly believe that this guy has a brain like a supercomputer.<br /><br />Law also gives an excellent performance as a young, vital Watson who seems to have a love-hate relationship with Holmes -- they're best friends, but Holmes' eccentricities are driving him nuts. Rachel McAdams gives a solid performance as Holmes' lady thief ex-girlfriend, and Mark Strong is wonderfully, sonorously sinister as the villain, who may or may not be a sorcerer.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" isn't actually based on any Sherlock Holmes stories, but Guy Ritchie's sharp-edged direction and Downey's quirky performance make it a fun experience. Just try to swallow the sillier action scenes.he massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\").

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|The Swedish version of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is one of the greatest foreign films in recent years, mostly due to the brilliant Noomi Rapace.<br /><br />So an American remake sounds like an automatic fail, even one directed by David Fincher. But this remake is an unusually faithful one, especially for Hollywood -- not only is the film actually set in Sweden, but it preserves the bleak, icy atmosphere and violent undercurrents of the original. And while Rooney Mara is no Noomi, she and Daniel Craig do solid jobs as the leads.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from a crooked executive.<br /><br />Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece, Harriet. She vanished years ago from the family's isolated island home, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found. When Mikael agrees to take the case, he's cybershadowed by the abused goth hacker Lisbeth Salander (Mara).<br /><br />Eventually Mikael ends up finding out about Lisbeth, and her very unique skills. Intrigued by this strange wounded woman, Mikael asks her to help him in his cold-case investigation, and the two begin unwinding a bizarre string of serial killings from long ago -- all tied to Bible quotes. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried -- and a killer who might target him next.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" takes the typical murder mystery, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the long-missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And Fincher gives it a surprisingly amount of loving care. No Americanized names, no switching the action to an American city, no soft-pedalling the gruesome sexual violence -- yep, that horrifying rape scene (and its gratifying payback) are here.<br /><br />Fincher isn't quite able to capture the wild, raw beauty of Sweden, but he is able to give the movie a somber, icy quality -- even in warmer months, it feels chilly and lonely. He unfolds the story with a minimum of Hollywood pyrotechnics, instead focusing on a collage of photographs, coded messages and old crimes half-forgotten. It's only in the last act that things start building into a bloody, creepy thriller.<br /><br />However, the wrap-up for the movie seems to drag. Yes, it's important to see what happens after the climax, especially if they're going to make a sequel -- but did we really need to SEE Lisbeth shopping for a wig?<br /><br />Rooney Mara doesn't quite fill the screen with dark dynamism as Lisbeth Salander should, but she does give a compelling performance -- a cold, almost cyborg-like presence that can suddenly explode into jagged icy rage. Daniel Craig's Mikael can't quite compete with Lisbeth, but Craig gives an outstanding performance as a weary journalist whose life is threatened by his encounter with the Vangers, and given new vitality by Lisbeth.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a bleakly beautiful piece of work -- the actors are excellent and Fincher shows great respect to the original movie.

B0095H4FAA|4.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" sounds more like a kung-fu movie than a Swedish thriller.<br /><br />But a Swedish thriller it is. And while posthumous debuts rarely get the attention they deserve -- or any attention, really -- the first novel of the late Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy starts slow, and slowly winds itself up into a tight knot of unique mystery and thriller elements. Just give it a few chapters to unfold.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstr&ouml;m. Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.<br /><br />It's a pretty cold case, and not a very inviting one. But when Vanger offers Mikael rewards he cannot refuse -- evidence on the villainous Wennerstr&ouml;m -- he finds himself facing the bizarre, sinister Vanger family with few leads to go on. Then he meets Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric, abused computer hacker who serves as his counterpoint. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br /><br />Posthumous debuts are a rarity -- publishers always want a series, sequels, publicity signings, and books headed by \\"By the Author Of...\\" You don't get any of that if the person is dead. So it's a sign of how amazing \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is that Larsson's uniquely mystery-thriller has received such attention across the world.<br /><br />And Larsson's book is a unique blend of old and new -- he takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story. It's the kind that feels the need to express itself even though it takes place in fiction. The only problem with the book is that Larsson pays undue attention to the whole Mikael-against-the-exec story. Not interesting, compared to the mystery.<br /><br />But Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- he's so world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, while Salander is a mass of hurts and quirks. While she sometimes seems cartoonish, she's also a vibrant little character with enough strength and power to lash back at attackers. The supporting characters are far darker fare, including a loopy Nazi weirdo.<br /><br />Take the works of Agatha Christie and smother them in a disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir world -- and you'll have something like \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" A hard read, but leaves you wondering what the next two books have in store.hed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story.

B0011UF79C|5.0|Imagine a world where your future is determined by your genes. Your schools, your job, your social status are all determined by what genetic flaws you have.<br /><br />Such is the world that we see in \\"Gattaca,\\" a scarily plausible sci-fi story that examines the implications of eugenics and genetic enhancement. Director Andrew Niccol thankfully never gets too preachy or \\"uplifting\\" -- instead he crafts a cleanly elegant story with a murder mystery as the catalyst, and the strong trinity Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.<br /><br />Vincent Freeman (Hawke) is an \\"invalid,\\" conceived without eugenic technology. On the day he was born, it was predicted that he would be myopic, might be bipolar, and would probably die at thirty from a heart defect. Throughout his life, Vincent dreams of becoming an astronaut, but his genetic status dooms him to menial labor.<br /><br />The solution: Vincent \\"buys\\" the identity and genetic profile of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Law), an Olympic swimmer who broke his back in a car crash. Vincent will pay Jerome, and Jerome will provide him with blood, urine, skin and hair samples.<br /><br />With Jerome's help, Vincent is accepted into Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, and is chosen for a manned flight to Titan. But when one of the administrators is found murdered, the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes nearby. If they discover who Vincent truly is, he won't just lose his dream -- he'll be convicted of murder.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is a movie that addresses one of life's great questions -- does destiny determine how we live our lives, or do we decide our own fate? There are no easy answers, but it's always best to err on the side of \\"we can make our own destiny\\" -- and this movie is basically all about one man's quest to determine his own fate, DNA be damned.<br /><br />None of the movies Andrew Niccol has made since \\"Gattaca\\" have even come close to this level of skill -- the movie is a slow, elegant winding of murder mystery and philosophical sci-fi. The plot quietly grows in tension as Vincent's life becomes more tangled up in lies and suspicion, with quietly powerful dialogue laced with dry humor (\\"I guess we can rule out suicide,\\" comments a cop as they bag a bloodied keyboard).<br /><br />And it's beautifully filmed. Everything is full of clean lines and cold light, with the occasional moment of symbolism -- note that the apartment that Eugene and Vincent share is centered around a giant DNA-style spiral staircase.<br /><br />And the final puzzle pieces are the actors, who are all really good. Ethan Hawke gives a quietly powerful performance as a man who goes to desperate lengths to fulfill his dreams, and Uma Thurman has the right mix of icy reserve and sweetness as a \\"valid\\" woman who falls in love with the man rather than his DNA.<br /><br />But the best performance is Jude Law. Jerome a truly tragic character, whose genetic perfection wasn't enough to keep disaster away -- he's proof that DNA can't make your life good or rewarding. Law plays him with a mixture of bitter wit and compassion, with perpetually shadowed eyes and a drink always in his hand. You may cheer for Vincent, but your heart will bleed for Jerome.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is a masterpiece of science fiction -- a richly nuanced, beautifully understated work that reminds you that, no matter where we come from, we can all reach for the stars.ical sci-fi.

B00AQ5QB0W|5.0|Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.<br /><br />But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.<br /><br />On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.<br /><br />The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?<br /><br />Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in \\"The Dark Crystal\\" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.<br /><br />Instead of some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.<br /><br />Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.<br /><br />At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (\\"Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!\\") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Crystal\\" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet.

If you are a fan of Neil Gaiman's novels, you should be forewarned. This is not a literal remake of the novel, or similar to his other works. That being said it is definitely worth watching, despite what the naysayers might state. The movie contains wit, humor, drama, action, suspense, and heart. To be frank, this isn't a perfect movie. It does have faults, and it is rather campy/silly. However, I have never cared about that. I could right a dissertation on it's negative aspects, however I choose to focus on the positive. Frankly, this is one of those movies that you will either love or hate. The acting ranges from terribly annoying (Sienna Miller), silly, charming, to wonderfully delightful. Robert De Niro is brilliant and hilarious in this movie and the rest of the cast is wonderful. The cinematography is excellent and stunning. This movie is full of wit and charm, and will leave you feeling happy and satisfied. It is the perfect movie to watch with age appropriate family and friends(no small children) because it teaches morals in an entertaining way: true love conquers all,  reaffirms the notion that nothing is more precious than finding and caring for one you love, you should treat others the way you wish to be treated, and be true to yourself regardless of the consequences. On a side note, Take That's \\"Rule the World\\", the theme song from the movie is also one of my favorites.
1416575464|4.0|Love this book.  I bought LIVING IN A NUTSHELL and this book at the same time and love them both.<br /><br />Great ideas!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|used the facebook app on my kindle fire for awhile and was pretty happy with it. seems to be having some issues as of lately tho
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend to watch on my Kindle. I'm a Prime member so I watched season 1 & 2 for free and after the 1st one I was hooked. Bought the whole 3rd season and can't wait for season 4!! So glad I heard about it...
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|The extra 8 or so minutes are worth the purchase if you are a devoted Twihard! Not to mention having a digital copy is really nice. As someone who owns 3 copies of New Moon for the Extras, so the extra 8 minutes are something that I'm willing to pay for. And they don't disappoint!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I rented this for my five year old Son to see if the DVD was worth buying. He liked the movie, but he says he was a little scared.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game... I'm completely addicted to it I can't put it down!  Definitely download this game its a must have!!!
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I liked the book, but it got a little crazy with the sequence changes, but for the most part, okay.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|We love musicals and were excited to see Les Miserables in the musical version. We loved the 1998 version with Liam Neeson  http://www.amazon.com/Les-Miserables/dp/B003F1JG9M/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1365211674&sr=8-5&keywords=les+miserables Great story! We were so disapointed with the majority of the singing using the same refrain over and over and over! There were a few good songs and singers, it took over half the movie before it started getting half way good. For two hours and 39 minutes the last 30 minutes were the best. If I would have paid to watch this in a theater I would have walked out the first 10 minutes. I gave it 3 stars for the story not the singing!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|No matter what platform you use you can go wrong with these zombies game,  and it doesn't  gives you any glitch on performance. I have it in all of platforms. Great game, made very well regardless of platform. I even have it in Steam valve. And always get it on sale or....free. Like the one they had for halloween for free! I recommend it highly
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Great story, great price, if you like action, this movie is a must.  Warning:  It would help if you've seen the rest of the series, BUT it does stand on its own.
B001XULSG6|5.0|I'm not one but still like the premise of the movie.  the borg suck. jhnju oipu ojuijui oijuuju 0bgyt  9
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've read all of Sanderson's works to date, and this is by far the best one yet. Looking forward to the next one.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Everything was great. Fun puzzles, great detective puzzles, wonderful graphics.  Would highly recommend to puzzle and hidden object games.  Loved it
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I like my drive into work with Josh. I am not liking all of the selections on the disk, as well as the one I chose it for, but its ok.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|If you like several stories combine in one film, you will love this movie.  Great actors, good plots, laughter and tears
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|By far the one of the best book I have and ever will read. Can't wait  read John Greens other books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive!!! I can't stop playing it. Please make more updates!!! Subway Surfers is a much better game than Temple Run.
B004Q9SO0O|5.0|great CD collection of essential jazz packaged as it should be - by the actual complete albums and not some odd mix & match. Great price, mailed quick by an outside the USA vendor. Thanks
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|On my Fire I have three Dragon books. Dragon Slippers, Dragon Flight, and Dragon Spear. Great books. Anyway I can't seem to resist this game. When I first got it I was kinda dissipointed and was afraid I would forget how to buy plant dragons. But I got the hang of it. Then it was like I was attached to it. My brother thought it was stupid but now he wishes he could get it on his phone. I got my whole family hooked. Now my mom has it on her iPad and my other brother has it on his fire. I want YOU to have it to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show filled with demonstrations of positive human character unlike the garbage fed to us in other shows like Desperate Housewives.  This show actually gives you characters to root for.  I can't wait for season 4.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is the best game a have ever played and the updates rock keep it up nice work<br />the best game I have ever played
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie doesn't live up to the other Bourne movies.  The plot was predictable and the entire movie seemed like one long exhausting chase scene.  Sorry for the lack of detail.  It has been a few weeks since I saw the movie and don't care to subject myself to the memory of it again.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|If it were not for the adds, it would be a 5 star deal, anything that makes me watch something will never get a high rating./
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Amazing show filled with demonstrations of positive human character unlike the garbage fed to us in other shows like Desperate Housewives.  This show actually gives you characters to root for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is amazing. when I first set eyes on it I totally forgot about temple run. its all u can ask for in an app. running, characters, and my favorite, subways. just kidding but if you know something then you'll download this app.
B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|They really dragged this story out trying to make it into more than one movie . Still it's pretty good .
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This reminds me of watching Brideshead Revisited back in the early 80's. Love the story. Love the characters. Love Downton!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My four-year-old granddaughter and I play Angry Birds when I have her. We loved this one, it is so much fun! Especially ad-free!!!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I enjoyed Shiver. The book gives a slightly different take on werewolves and introduces a heart warming love story at the same time. The characters pull you in and the dialogue is filled with typical teenage angst.<br /><br />If Maggie Stiefvater continues to write series like this I believe the movies are not too far off and she will have a great career!<br /><br />The romance scenes are  handled well and tastefully, so parents can feel comfortable letting their teens read this.<br /><br />If you enjoy young adult paranormal tales, pick this one up. I have finished the series and will pick up Stiefvater's next series to see what she does with it. She has a great mind and an excellent imagination.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a very detailed and well written account of the lives of pilots on both sides of the war.  While this centers around an incredible event, there is so much more to be told and the author does it expertly.  This book is very difficult to put down.  I wish I could read again for the first time.
B004TJ1GVK|1.0|Showgirls is not sexy. It shows how the Vegas showgirls are exploited by the men who run the casinos as they fight with other would-be showgirls for a job. The entire film is mean spirited. Paul Verhoeven has made some excellent films. This is not one of them.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Great game for killing a bit of time. Its good to play other games while your out of energy  in the game as well if you like Gameloft games I recommend Dungeon hunter 3
B000O5B4C4|1.0|On the other hand, if you're looking for erotica, you will be disappointed. There are hundreds of websites on the internet that have erotic films and pictures for whatever types of erotica you like. This is a Paul Verhoeven film: the best Verhoeven films were made in his native Holland. I recommend the Paul Verhoeven Collection of 5 early films, which can be found on Amazon.
B00845MRKE|5.0|I got my son the 5-BD Collector's Edition for Xmas, 2011. He loved it. Then, this new set came out for 2012, and it ended up on his Xmas list again.<br /><br />He really likes this movie. I guess it's better to have your college sophomore into this than reading Ayn Rand.<br /><br />There are other reviews here that go into much more depth about this movie and this packaging. I can only agree with their 5-star ratings.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I'm not a huge Stephen King book fan, because they're creepy and scary.  This book was a very well written account of someone going back into time to prevent the Kennedy assassination, but with a different twist...how would the world be different?  And would it have been better for it? Great story of cause and effects for a number of characters.  It's a long book but very good read!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my son. He's a fan of these films having seen them all in theatrical release. They look and sound great on BD.<br /><br />Can't comment on the extras as I haven't watched any of them yet.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was not prepared for the ending, but the middle and beginning were also great. I would recommend this book to someone who likes war books, maybe.
B000BYY0RY|1.0|I did not realize that this product would not play in American technology, at least not the dvd player I have. Sad, but i forgot to return it back when I realized that. Better knowing next time.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Had a slow development from the beginning, which was actually ok, because it made me watch Russell Crowe's character's every thought, every move as well as keep curious enough to wonder just how he was going to pull off such an impossible feat. Crowe was amazing and very believable as John Brennan, husband, father and teacher.<br /><br />Elizabeth Banks also did an outstanding job, as his wife, struggling to keep her sanity behind prison walls,with hope of ever being release growing dimmer with each day, desperately trying to keep her distant relationship with her husband and son while losing touch with herself at the same time.<br /><br /> Aisha Hinds, as the detective in charge, who caught on to Crowe's character's intent, was also outstanding in his role as the one who was always one step behind, but ever so close to catching our main character. His sometimes crass and direct, no nonsense character definitely helped drive the intensity of the plot, as the movie progressed.<br /><br />As the plot developed, so did my interest and curiosity to what was going to happen next. As the movie reached its climatic points, I was glued to the screen watching each frame to wondering how it was going to end. Great movie!<br /><br />Kudos to the director, Paul Haggis as Writer and Director and Fred Cavaye (Writer) for the creating this amazing movie.  Smartly written and well done with a great cast.<br /><br />Recommended viewing indeed!
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is such a good movie.will keep you watching till the very end.Annette Bening issuch a good actress and the chemistry between her and Kevin Spacey really comes through.great movie. would reccomend to all
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I sat on the sofa with my husband and teen aged children. I knew Life of Pi had won awards but I needed to read reviews before deciding whether to watch it. I read the reviews on Amazon before watching this movie. In fact I usually come to Amazon before making a final decision on a film. The part that baffles me is the negative reviews of this film. I don't understand why anyone would have compared this to Avatar or why anyone after watching the entire film would bother bringing Avatar up. The only reason I can fathom as to why anyone would dislike this movie is if they didn't understand it. And that in itself baffles me too. Visually, this movie was stunning. Period. The cinematography and effects were gorgeous. Gorgeous not like Avatar...gorgeous like Life of Pi. The two are two very very different types of movie. But by the end of this movie I knew that it was not just a film for entertainment sake or about visual effects. It was human, raw, and frankly the story isn't about the tiger, it's about the boy who survived. The story is his. No matter what the real ending is, matters not. What matters is that we as humans face sometimes the most unfathomable trials and challenges and how we handle them is entirely up to us. When I finished watching this and I was done wiping my tears away, I knew I wanted to see it again. Somehow I felt like the lessons in the story weren't all going to be caught on the first try. It is worth watching again for the parts I may have missed. I was in awe of the cast and how effortlessly they played their parts. There were times when I laughed, times when I cried, times when I cringed and that is what a movie experience is supposed to be. No, that is what story telling is supposed to be. This film most definitely deserved academy awards. And I'll end this review...this very simplistic review with saying that I feel sorry for those that hated this movie. They missed out on the powerful message and the beautiful story. I can only be glad for myself that I got to experience Pi's story. I know I was transformed. .
B000F7CMRW|5.0|George Clooney was so good in this movie. it is very well made and the acting is unbeliveable. would recommned this to all
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie before reading the books.  Thought the movie was interesting so I figured I would try reading the trilogy.  Loved the books.  I could not put them down.  Highly recommend!
B0041D843M|4.0|He belabored his points. The information was good. Would have like his clear dietary recommendations succinctly at the end of the book.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Excellent service<br /><br />It isn't peeling apart and it was a replcement for the old one that did. Thank you Amazon!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I love the suspense and thrill of this show. It leaves me wanting to watch more and more every time. I have to watch the rest of the seasons now, because I'm enthralled. I can't wait to watch the rest.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I actually bought 2 of these.  I find the Kindle Fire to be quite heavy and wanted something light and simple.  You barely notice this and it is quite sturdy.  One of the selling points was the little video that described the product.  anyway you cant go wrong with this one
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I started with season five which is the 11th doctor, Matt Smith and I fell in love with the show. i didn't like the ninth doctor at first. Then I watched it again and suddenly started to like him and Rose and Jack and everything about them. The 9th doctor grew on me and I ended up loving this season as well. If you are having a hard time watching this, my suggestion is to give it a couple episodes because he grows on you and it's fun to have the back story on his companions for when you watch the 10th doctor in seasons 2-4.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app! It is fun and cures boredom. It is also different than all the other social apps. It was working fine until it kept crashing. At first I would always force close, but tthen I would just press wait, and it would work fine. Until today. it kept force closing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't understand my friends' fascination with Downton Abbey;I get it now!  You will too.  Excellent drama that keeps you in suspense.  Loved the characters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A wonderful story of relationships and love stories. You feel like you are with the characters as they are living their lives. Nicholas Sparks books are always enjoyable reads.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I have this game.on my laptop I love it on the kindle fire it makes playing even more enjoyable the app runs so smooth a must have for your kindle .
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|Just knowing Channing Tatum was dancing in the movie was enticement enough, but after watching it and enjoying the plot and seeing he and his now wife together, I am so happy I bought this DVD! It's one I'll be watching frequently, along with Magic Mike, GI Joe, and others where he makes an appearance...that little boy smile just makes each movie a fun time!!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|enjoyed excellent clear reception...all was as it was advertised and I look forward to using amazon streaming again very soon
B009FB3XTA|4.0|It's funny how much we either eliminate from our heads the songs going on in movies due to action, or concentrate on the music. I like being able to listen to just the songs chosen for  the movie and then go back and rewatch the movie and see how the songs fit...I liked the additions, with changes, to a couple of songs from the original movie.<br /><br />This is a good CD for Twihards!
B001XV3LSS|4.0|This is a really good movie that will keep your interest.  It takes a fairly realistic approach to humanity's first contact with aliens.<br /><br />The movie isn't perfect however.  It loses a star for the ridiculous Fred-Phelps-esque subplot of Jake Busey's character.  The suspension of disbelief is partially ruined by his actions.<br /><br />Still a good movie for people who enjoy sci-fi.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This is definitely a chick flick and I've watched it multiple times...Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin make a great team for this movie and, even though it's got a predictable ending (which I love, as long as it's a positive one), it's one any romantic will find herself watching over and over...
B008RTE09S|5.0|My husband is the Beatles fan I purchased this for him, he very much enjoyed the blu ray and was happy to have it, not being a fan of theirs it managed to keep me in my chair so that says a lot!.  Barbara. Australia.
B002NXSRW0|5.0|The GI Joe action adventure is great, and with Channing Tatum and The Rock there to keep you focused, who could ask for more? Order this and enjoy many hours of fun!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|I often get told that I don't understand what really went on during the Second World War, well for a start I was not born until 1946, however really has the world changed that much we still do awful things to each other, now more so in the name of religion, and that has become a pick a box one.  However the movie is very well done and sticks to a lot the the facts, that people can help and make a difference to others in the name of being a good human, not acting like an animal towards each other?, sorry animals you are so much better. Barbara. Australia.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I'm not a big James Bond fan, but my husband is...So, I  bought this for him and found myself enjoying it with him. The storyline and action are very good...the ending is surprising...I recommend it to others, but probably not just for women...this seems like a movie that needs multiple watchers, for some reason...
B00772M1F6|5.0|I don't care who you are or where you are. You need to buy this album.<br /><br />(and there are four more words required)
B001AW156U|5.0|Why aren't the controllers made like this to begin with?<br />These are a must have for any level of gamer.
B000MV9026|3.0|I bought this for our three year old grandson...a little bored with it. Too much singing and not enough action.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The movie is great, but the \\"Infinifilm\\" bonus features are very poor.<br /><br />With a DVD I expect a menu of bonus features like the story behind making the movie, and interviews with the stars.  With this movie you get none of that.  Instead you are expected to play the movie with the \\"Infinifilm\\" option, which puts a clickable message at the bottom of the screen periodically throughout the movie.  If you press Select on your remote, then you are taken to a short bonus feature for maybe 30-60 seconds, then returned to your movie.  This means you have to watch the entire movie in hopes of seeing something interesting, and most them of them are not interesting at all.  They use a lot of storyboard fillers.<br /><br />If I had to do this over I would have bought the amazon dvd \\"The Butterfly Effect / The Butterfly Effect 2 (Double Feature)\\", which doesn't have any bonus features, but at least as a 2nd movie to watch.<br /><br />Unless forced to I don't plan on buying any dvd labeled \\"Infinifilm\\" again.<br /><br />Still a good movie however.
B0047E9TRA|5.0|i wouldnt consider this movie to be a horror, more of a psychological coming of age tragedy,<br /><br />Carrie white is a outcast, the loner girl who has no friends, every school has a &#34;carrie&#34; in it, in the movie carrie has her first period, and she thinks she is dying, so when she beserks, the gym teacher is there to console her and explain, then carrie's mom margaret goes crazy with her religious beliefs. Carrie begins to realize she has the gift of telekinetic abilities, the rest you have to watch and find out!!!!!!! there are a few awesome scenes in the film:<br /><br />1. the gym teacher slaps Kris square in the face<br />2. When carrie breaks the mirror at her house<br />3. After Margaret stabs carrie, carrie lets loose!!!!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I am one of those drawn to Nesbo because of the Larsson trilogy. Totally different writing style, but excellent story and character development.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  The characters are clear and well written - believable people in an unbelievable situation.  I had a hard time putting it down!  Can't wait to read more in the series.
B008M7BQHE|4.0|We continue to watch the series as a family (13 and 14YO) and are having fun with the story and characters.  It's a good time.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Wish there were more games this fun<br />This game is very entertaing when you play this game it was hard to put it down<br />You will love playing this game
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is by far the greatest Slender Man app in the Amazon app store! It keeps you entertained for hours!! Turn the level to hard when you are playing with friends for more fun. The only thing I wish there was is more areas to go to...and the glitch where you fall down v.v but super fun anyway! :D
B003TSEEDY|5.0|well written, best journal book ive ever read with interesting twists throughout. movie was well done also. a must read
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I basically hated history in high school.  But this book explains the time of slavery, the bias, the slave culture in an easy reading chronology of the time through the eyes of a  white indentured servant and her slave family.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I admit that I've never been to see &quot;The Phantom of The Opera&quot; or &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;.  The expenses far too expensive for me. I only saw the movie own the CD and DVDs.  But let me tell you, this is an eyes opener to both of the performance and the stage production.  It was translated and perform with greatest care.  This Love Never Dies' DVD is highly recommended for people who love excellent performance.  Eventhough it had been recorded which I does not care about the intension, but the casts and crews were amazing.  At the end I was touched by mixes understanding and overwhlem with all the emotional that the casts had been delivered thru their performance. Buy it and enjoy it, open you heart and ride yourself with their dedication to the splendor of music
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|This is a review for the vinyl album, which came out later than everything else. It includes two albums, and the cd. The quality of the vinyl itself is great, and very heavy. Mine plays all the way through clean. There is one current picture of Bowie on one of the inner sleeves, and lyrics are included.<br /><br />This is a grown up rock and roll album, there isn't anything gimmicky or trendy about it. The lyrics are thoughtful, playful, poetic,and emotive, exactly what you would expect from Bowie. This is an album I can play 10 years from now, and it will still sound current. Bowie is a good singer, but not a great one, and I'm surprised and pleased at how well his voice has held up over the years. It's like he is bringing a main course and everyone else is finger food.<br /><br />&#34;The Stars are Out Tonight&#34; is one the best crafted songs I've heard in a very, very long time. I love it. I admire Bowie for not doing any press or making Twitter and Facebook posts, too, he is from a different time and his actions reflect that maturity.<br /><br />If you are a Bowie fan, you probably already have it. If you are over -cough- 45 and think you might like it, get it. If your idea of a good singer is Justin Bieber, it's not for you, but you might like to listen to a real musician make great music.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The book was mostly an account of the experiences of the two men--one a German pilot and the other an American pilot.  By far the largest part of the book was about the experiences of the German pilot.  It was interesting to me especially since I know nothing about the pilots of WW11 and what took place during the bombing raids.  I thought more of the book would have been devoted to how they met and their final meeting but it did take place and it was a great ending to a fine book.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|If you've seen the previews, you already saw the best of it. Additionally, movies that depend on endless profanity to attempt to entertain bore me to death.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I loved lord of the rings and this is just as good.I can't wait for part two and three.A great series
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It's like bejeweled but more challenging. I can't help redoing each level til I get the best score possible. Very addictive, but very fun. Love it.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This truly is a work of art. A film for the ages. Outstanding acting by all, but especially Daniel Day-Lewis.

B008HJGPVO|3.0|I have a Kindle Fire (original). This and the original Amazon Basics stylus work well with it. Recently got an iPad Mini. This stylus works poorly with that. Takes too much pressure for a hit, sometimes way too much. Works differently on different areas of the screen (nowhere week), and on drag gestures like drawing there is a large lag before the touch is recognized so it almost never starts drawing where you wanted it to. So with iOS devices I would steer clear.<br /><br />I also don't like how soft/spongy it is but honestly I didn't notice that with the Kindle so think it's more related to it doesn't work without lots of pressure and given it's soft it just feels wrong to me now.<br /><br />I will say I loved it when I only had a Kindle Fire.
B006AN78XS|4.0|I couldn't get away from the fact that Owen Wilson had to play Woody Allen, but in the spots where he didn't need to do things that the Woody Allen character always has to do, he was effective.  I enjoyed the nostalgia, but ultimately wished that I was better at suspension of disbelief.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. It can't come out soon enough. Need to make an update on the app though sometimes randomly shuts down
B00BWGISB4|5.0|When they say they did this for the fans, they aren't lying.  The Block ended up growing on me, but I loved almost every song on this album the first time I heard it.  There are no clubby song or guest artists I could care less about, with one or two exceptions.  By using the same writers/producers this feels like an album, not a bunch of sounds put on a cd together.  I also love the fact Jon and Danny are at least somewhat represented on this album, unlike the last one.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|A clear, concise examination about how skills are grown in human beings. It really opened my eyes as far as re-examining my practice habits (I golf). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning how to better themselves in whatever activity they pursue.
B008602KQI|4.0|Just plain Fabulous! To believe such a contest could have been performed during the earlier times of our history, such as fighting lions in arenas in Rome for instance, this really makes you believe this really could have happened all right!  The tale of love between siblings only inspires this movie.  The cameras working with the directors and the producer makes for a very fine movie to say the least!  If you haven't watched this yet, this is one you don't want to let get away before you do.  Because of the horrid violence, I recommend this movie for persons 16+ OF viewed with a parent or guardian. Enjoy!
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover. The author paints an honest picture of a semi disturbed genius. Someone who, if born today may have been put on medication and/or classified and grown up different. We get a sense of not only Steve Jobs' intelligence but the amazing cluster of tech revolutionaries in California and the history of it for so long. You also have empathy for his family and contempt for Steve's sometimes lack of attachment for his family and loved ones. The book is able to portray Steve's highs and lows in a fair, impartial way.<br />You walk away amazed at how someone with the potential for such unabashed behavior could become so successful.
1451695195|2.0|He spend part of the book descibing what experiences he had in heaven, but mostly he was trying to prove that clinically he was dead and his brain was not functioning: that he didn't just dream this.  If you went out and bought this book, I assume you already believe him on that front, so he didn't have to get so medical about it. He gets bogged down with the clinical stuff.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Received it quickly and in excellent condition. What more can one hope for? Good experience. Love the movie and will pass it on to a friend after I watch it again, as it is a wonderful story about the human psyche.
B0012GMW34|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this in the past only because I'm not to keen on Santana's political thoughts and even though he is a great musician, sometimes that makes me not want to support them.  Political stuff done.<br /><br />Very good album, glad I bought it.  The music just speaks to me and makes me relax and just enjoy their jamming.  My favorite track is the opener A Love Supreme.
1451696191|3.0|This is an easy flowing book. I read it in a day. However, I purchased it for my high school class and it contains so much drugs and sex (in a pretty positive light), there's no way I'm comfortable with making it available for my students. I read reviews after I bought it that say it was a frequently banned book. I didn't see them before. Just a warning. I plan to let my teenager read it because we can discuss it but I won't make that choice for other parents

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Great story. At first I thought it might go a bit slow but happily found it to be quite a page turner. The photos add so much to the story and are quite interesting even just on their own. I did see some reviews of the photos being hard to see in digital format. I read on a fire and only had a bit of trouble with the letter at the end. I also flipped through the book on my kindle keyboard and found the photos just as easy to see.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|When I first got this game on the first day, it was fun. It had a cool glitches which was that you have to die, then before the save me sign goes gone, you tap the right corner 3 times, then you say yes, then you play again. But when I played it on the second day, I couldn't play anymore. Weird. I kept un- installing and reinstalling this game but it still would not let me in the second day after I get the game.

B007SGM084|4.0|This is my guilty pleasure - I don't typically read trashy romance novels.  But this one is just so good.  Not a great story or plot, and by far the most dysfunctional relationship I read about.  If I were the main character's friend, I would tell her she was idiot stuck in an abusive relationship.  But somehow, the author makes it work and I read this in between other, classier reads to take my mind off things.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can't believe there are only 5 stars for ratings I would give u 80 billion stars so fun app is great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|...but satisfying nonetheless, at least for me. With a touch of positive psychology on the very last page, this clearly ends as a complex story of redemption. Supposedly a book for juveniles (as it's described in some places), it's a worthy trilogy for adults as well. It may help clarify values: how does a person prioritize the things that matter most in life and death?
1476719071|5.0|You see up there in the blurb where it says this book is addictive? Yeah, before starting it, I didn't believe it would be. From the blurb, it seems to be one of those books where you can easily predict the outcome before even opening the book (and you can for the most part). How can a book like that possibly be addictive? I don't know, but it was! Beautiful Disaster was seriously hard to put down.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster was so good. Yeah, Abby and Travis don't have a healthy relationship. It's real, though. You've got two damaged young adults in a relationship. You're bound to have fights, yelling matches, and breakups. It was actually much more believable than the books that put two messed up people together and suddenly everything's all rainbows and sunshine. Come on, get real! While it would be nice if you could meet someone and have things be perfect right from the beginning, it rarely works out like that. In real life, much like the book, there are things to figure out and work through along the way.<br /><br />The drama and craziness was the biggest reasons I loved Beautiful Disaster. If you like passionate romance with a side of crazy, I think you'd really enjoy this book.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I chose it because it was up for the Oscar. Also because it was a true story. I like tense movies and this was good and tense.

I really enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />Lake, Will, Julia, Kel, Caulder, Eddie all of them were great characters.<br /><br />There honestly wasn't a moment where I was annoyed by Lake. She reacted to the many cards that were dealt to her the same way I probably would have. My heart hurt for her so many times, 18 is such a young age to deal with some things.<br /><br />Poetry isn't normally my thing but some of the Slams that were performed were amazing.

1476733953|1.0|Wool is one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. I read about 100 pages of Wool--this thing--and then I thought, \\"You've got to be kidding. This is a joke, right?\\" I didn't have enough patience, or time, or will, to answer that question for myself or to determine whether the science made any sense. A tip of my hat goes to those with the strength of will to slog through this mess. This thing reads like a ninth-grade writing assignment (I know, because I still have my \\"story\\"). Wool reads no better than that, and it's several hundred times as long. The characters are cardboard cutouts, their actions are stock. The writing is awful, embarrassingly so. There's this deputy character near the beginning, Marnes, who's apparently of some rural or Southern extraction. The dialogue for this character is laughable, like this: \\"Truer than true, I reckon. Never figure to outlive so many. Sure as sin don't see me outliving you.\\" Give me a break. Never mind that people have been living in this damn silo for centuries (so I guess it's true what they say: You can take the hick out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the hick--It's genetic!). All the dialogue is of this caliber, although it's not all of the cracker sort. What I read felt like I ate 20 corn dogs one after the other. . . . Years ago I read Samuel Delany's Dhalgren, also a fat book (more than 800 pages). I read that book until about 10 pages from the end. Incomprehensible from the beginning, circling `round and `round. After days and days of reading and hoping to get some payoff, I couldn't go any further. I had to stop--had to--to retain any modicum of self-respect. I won't make that mistake again. Do not read Wool. You may come to hate yourself for the life you wasted.<br /><br />Wool Reflux<br /><br />First I read 100 pages of Wool, and I threw Wool against the proverbial wall. But then I had second thoughts. One part of me said I should give this book time to right itself, and another partof me got curious: How bad can it get? So, I picked the book off the floor, dusted it off, and, against my better judgment, gave it another go. I finished it, and I was right. It's one lousy read.<br /><br />Wool (and Mr. H) really ticked me off, and this is why. I hate investing what little spare time I have on a book, like Wool, that turns out to be obviously thrown together. If you're going to write a novel, you have to respect your readers. You're asking them for many hours of their time, and you owe them at least a half-hearted attempt at craft. Wool is such a heap of so many kinds of junk, it took my breath away. It fascinates me why people would like this thing. I could make a life's work out of cataloguing all the awfulness, categorizing all the classes and subclasses of crap, but what's the point of pissing away any more of my life? So here are just a few things--the curious, the dumbfounding, and the infuriating--about this book. First the curious. Most of the characters--male and female--seem like different masks of the same person. They have similar kinds of inner monologues, actions, and psychologies (takes on life, what gets them crying, angry, etc.). The characters act weirdly similar, as if they had emanated from a dream of someone who cannot imagine anyone unlike himself (i.e., a psychopath, or Tom Cruise). Is this the hidden key to Wool? Is it all a dream of a deranged mind? With no imagination? Alas, that's been done before (TV's Dallas), so maybe that is not Mr. H's intent. Now the dumbfounding. Stuff just doesn't add up, scientifically or otherwise. The dialogue is not only clunky, the way a character talks changes. Marnes first starts speaking with this ridiculous Southern or Western drawl. Then it disappears. I don't get it. I read these color-by-number exchanges, and the author can't even stay within the lines. And then we have the page after mind-numbing page of inner monologues and minutiae about some trivial thing a character is doing. Then I wised up and started skimming to get past these narrative ruts. It's like driving a washboard road. If you don't drive fast, it'll shake your car apart. That's how I had to read this book. I'm not saying describing something in minute detail never serves a purpose, but as someone else has noted, it's got to do that (read Cormac McCarthy's description of a character's fixing a shopping cart in The Road to see how it does work). Finally, the infuriating Mr. H does not create a plausible world. It's obvious he has not thought through how things would work in his silo world. Either that or he can't. OK, for instance, you've got this oil well down at the bottom of the silo somewhere. There's no description of this little detail, so I have to picture something on my own. What I come up with is an old pumpjack at the bottom of a shaft, just rocking away. This is absurd. I know it, so give me something I can latch onto! The silo is hermetically sealed off from the outside. The author needs to help the reader visualize how the silo works that way so the reader can suspend disbelief. Mr. H never does that. For example, how do you get rid of the gases that accompany oil extraction so you don't asphyxiate the entire population? And you've apparently got a smelter down deep to process ore from the mines (that burrow off in a single direction, apparently) into metal for homemade guns, nuts, bolts, pipe wrenches, etc. The smelter alone should do everyone in. It's never mentioned. The silo saga is set hundreds of years in the future, but the characters think and feel like what a high school kid from the suburbs of late 20th century New Jersey might imagine an adult of that era would think and feel like. I'm sorry, but you've got to consider how cultures might undergo change over hundreds of years (compare Earthlings in the 14th century with those in the 20th--not the same). This book is way beyond inconsistent; it's not remotely credible. If you like science fiction, there areso, so many places you can go and inhabit an interesting world with a consistent internal logic. Arthur Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama (the first Rama book), any Heinlein, Stanislaw Lem's Solaris and Fiasco, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Gibson and Sterling's The Difference Engine. And on and on. Go ahead, Google \\"best sci-fi books\\" and find something to your taste. You can do a hell of a lot better than Wool.<br /><br />P.S. I checked Wool out from the excellent public library in my neighborhood.

0143117009|5.0|Diamond presents a compelling narrative about common elements that led to the collapse of several societies across history. He examines how societies used and mis-used the advantages and resources that they had at hand, as well as how they mis-understood their deficiencies.<br /><br />The history behind each of the societies is compelling and accessible. Diamond paints a full-color picture of each society and its collapse.<br /><br />The author does get preachy at times, and there is a reasonable argument that he sometimes makes claims that are not entirely supported by the evidence. But once you read this book, you will never think about societies or history in quite the same way again.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|The perfect blend of fantasy and reality. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As one who feels a bit overdone by the sparkly vampires and so on that dominate this genre, this was a breath of fresh air. The fantastical is mixed with the tangible in such a way as to feel almost plausible in the daily world. I left this book feeling satisfied.

B0016KJKIG|5.0|Did not like the leather sheath that originally came with the Leatherman Charge TTi. First off, the tool WILL slip out the side, and there is no way to carry the extra bit kit or extension.<br />  This sheath solves all of those problems, and then some. Tool WILL NOT slip out of the sheath. It easily holds the extra bit kit and bit extension inside an inner pocket behind the tool. I have a small AAA Streamlight flashlight inside 1 of the side pouches, and a firesteel in the other. This still leaves another pouch in the front for the firesteel striker, or a small fishing kit. Very pleased with this sheath, and I never worry about loosing my multitool.

B000IOM1Z0|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project released its fifth album in as many years entitled The Turn of a Friendly Card in November of 1980.<br />After two OK albums out of 1978's Pyramid and 1979's Eve (both of which were pale in comparison to their 1976 debut Tales of Mystery and Imagination and its 1977 followup I Robot), The Alan Parsons Project were faced with losing its luster. In early 1980, Alan Parsons (well known engineer and producer who had worked with The Beatles as a tape operator and engineered Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother and classic Dark Side of the Moon and produced albums for Pilot, The Hollies and Al Stewart) and collaborator Eric Woolfson went to Monte Carlo as tax exiles to write a concept about the perils and dangers of gambling entitled The Turn of a Friendly Card and they (along with Alan Parsons Project musicians that were bass player David Paton and guitarist Ian Bairnson (formerly of the band Pilot known for its 1975 hit \\"Magic\\"), drummer Stuart Elliott (famed for his work on Al Stewart's Year of the Cat and Time Passages albums and on Paul McCartney's 1984 hit \\"No More Lonely Nights\\") and orchestrator Andrew Powell) went to France to record the album and a change of location and pace worked in the band's favor. Plus, ex-10cc members Kevin Godley and Lol Creme designed the album's sleeve instead of Hipgnosis (whom seemed to have an off year in 1980 laying low from sleeve designs apart from Peter Gabriel, The Scorpions and Mike Rutherford). When the album was released, it was at the time of rock and roll going through an identity crisis with metal, Hard rock, Corporate Rock and New Wave battling it out and also pop schlock was starting to come into fashion and would people find a prog rock concept album acceptable in 1980, well it did (as this and Pink Floyd's The Wall (which hit #1 earlier in 1980) proved).<br />We open the album with the uptempo rocker \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\". What a great opener and was the first album not to use an instrumental as an opening track and the lead vocals were sung great by Elmer Gentry. Next is the album's first single and a great song, the Top 20 charting \\"Games People Play\\" which was sung by Lenny Zatatek and its hypnotic keyboard keeps you on your toes the whole time and great guitar from Bairnson. Next is the album's second Top 20 hit which was the ballad \\"Time\\" which was sung by the late Eric Woolfson (which this song was his lead vocal debut on a Project track) and is a beautiful song about how time is to be taken for granted until it's gone and musically reminds one of \\"Us and Them\\" by Pink Floyd. We then segue into a nice piano and acoustic guitar doodle which goes into the first half's up tempo closer \\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\\", which was sung by Zatatek and is a great song about refusing to leave and the song ends with a reprise of the piano and acoustic guitar intro.<br />The second half of the album starts with the instrumental \\"The Gold Bug\\" which is a great instrumental featuring sax work by Mel Collins. Then we have the 16 and a half minute title suite which takes up the rest of the album. First is \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card Part 1\\" which is sung by Chris Rainbow and is a great song which sets the epic up for its peaks and valleys. The next part is \\"Snake Eyes\\" which is also sung by Rainbow and an awesome section. Next is the first instrumental section of this piece entitled \\"Ace of Swords\\" which is incredible. We then go into the country-ish sounding \\"You've Got Nothing Left to Lose\\" which has Woolfson on lead vocal and Chris Rainbow and Alan Parsons on harmonies and just a great song before going into an uncredited reprise of \\"Snake Eyes\\" featuring a great guitar solo by Ian Bairnson. \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card Part Two\\" closes things once again featuring vocals from Chris Rainbow and a great solo from Bairnson to close the album.<br />The Turn of a Friendly Card album became the Alan Parsons Project's biggest selling album since I Robot here in the US (and was their first to go Platinum since I Robot in 1977) and reached #13 in the US at the beginning of 1981.<br />The album was re-released in 2009 and was superbly remastered by Parsons himself with Dave Collins and features SIX bonus tracks including demos for \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\" and \\"The Gold Bug\\". Plus early run throughs of \\"You've Got Nothing Left to Lose\\". Then an early take of the ballad \\"Time\\" and a rough mix of \\"Games People Play\\" to close out the remastered album. These tracks are excellent different looks of each of the album's tracks.<br />Recommended!heir first to go Platinum since I Robot in 1977) and reached #13 in the US at the beginning of 1981.<br />The album was re-released in 2009 and was superbly remastered by Parsons himself with Dave Collins and features SIX bonus tracks including demos for \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\" and \\"The Gold Bug\\".

B007K3JFUQ|3.0|The movie was packed with action and interesting effects that magnify Holmes' abilities.  It had several fun moments.  It was irreverent, though, to the memory of the original works, in my opinion.  One instance was Holmes' rancorous relationship with the motherly Mrs. Hudson, who Doyle was very respectful to.  Also, in the stories, Irene Adler was admired by Holmes, but in the movie she is something of a call-girl love interest - quite a contrast to the finely adjusted temperament of the Holmes in literature.  Both Holmes and Watson are messy and careless in dress and conduct, quite a departure from the literary works.<br /><br />Despite my criticism, I do understand that this was an effort to bring Holmes to the attention of a new, younger audience, and employing all the drama and humor possible to make it attractive.  It was no doubt a purposeful departure from tradition for that reason.  Perhaps I cannot be pleased by a modern Holmes.

B009K86D86|5.0|I became a vegetarian several years ago, because I could no longer ignore the inhumane conditions and the suffering of the animals to bring meat to my plate.  After watching this movie, I realized it is more than just animals. To the corporations behind the farms, it's all about greed - the almighty dollar. Farmers either get on board or are ruined by the bullies that are these corporations.<br />I knew there was a good possibility that watching this movie would make me angry and that I would be disgusted by what is happening in the food industry.  It did and I was.<br />It's definitely time to vote with your wallet and buy organic.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980.<br />Now, a Blu-Ray (and DVD) has been released of the classic Supertramp performances from Paris in December of 1979 called Supertramp Live in Paris 1979.<br />The film was shot and recorded in December of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the penultimate night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Supertramp Live in Paris is a superb concert film, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/singer/keyboard player/songwriter Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes an extremely important live document of the classic lineup of the band, indeed. This concert film had been fabled for years and no footage had been officially released (aside \\"The Logical Song\\" and \\"Dreamer\\" as promo films) it wasn't until the master tapes of the December 1, 1979 performance were discovered in drummer Bob Siebenberg's barn in cow dung. Then longtime producer Peter Henderson and old concert sound engineer Russell Pope (whom produced the original album) painstakingly restored and transferred the audio from analog to digital and brilliantly mixed the audio. Then Peter Clifton (the same man who finished Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same after Joe Massot bailed) salvaged the footage shot by Derek Burbidge (who filmed much of The Police's promo videos in the day) and added some bits to round out the film. What is available is a superb document of the classic Supertramp lineup.<br />Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live concert film, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century (the spirited opener \\"School\\", a slightly extended \\"Bloody Well Right\\", an excellent \\"Hide in Your Shell\\", a superb \\"Asylum', the Top 20 hit \\"Dreamer\\", a superb \\"Rudy\\" and the closing \\"Crime of the Century\\" which closes this live concert film), two songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (\\"Another Man's Woman\\" and \\"Two of Us\\" both superior to studio versions), three from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments (the title cut, \\"Give a Little Bit\\" and the best version of \\"Fool's Overture\\" ever which has an ending that is to be seen to believe), and half of the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America (the monster hit \\"The Logical Song\\", the hit \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", the title cut, the Top 20 smash \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" and the epic closer \\"Child of Vision\\").<br />Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/singer/songwriter Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards and additional backing vocals, drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is sped at faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section and the visuals of the backdrop films are superb.<br />The songs that weren't shot for the film which were recorded (\\"Ain't Nobody But Me\\", \\"You Started Laughing\\", \\"Downstream\\", \\"A Soapbox Opera\\" and \\"From Now On\\") are here as bonus tracks with visuals created specifically for the DVD/Blu-Ray.<br />Also, much to Roger Hodgson's chagrin, the songwriting credits are printed on the back of the Blu-Ray (may not have been there on the first issue) and the Supertramp fans are just grateful that this classic document of the band's peak is FINALLY AVAILABLE!!!<br />Highly recommended!), two songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis?

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks I highly recommend. Buying it so what it cost $7.00 It is a great game for your mind.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|I was unhappy with the non-traditional approach of the first movie in this series, and all of that applies here.  In addition, this one became more overt in emphasizing baser conduct, something unheard of in the stories.  I was very disappointed in the continual inferences to homosexuality (between Holmes and Watson) and exhibitionism (Mycroft) - all foreign to the writings of Doyle.  The DVD also contained some actor interviews and comments, and it is clear that they considered it fun to be irreverent to the characters, in effect by slandering their memory.  I suppose it is the standard method for British and American humor these days.<br /><br />This one had even more wild action and drama, and focused on Holmes' arch-enemy Moriarity.  As base as it was, the movie did convey the strong brotherly friendship between Holmes and Watson, though in an irreverent way.

No wonder it won so many awards. First watched it in simple Blu-Ray HD, then we ordered a Sony 3D Blu-Ray DVD player. Even more exciting & amazing. Even beyond the amazing computer effects, animatronics and such, it is one worthwhile and entertaining film. Highly recommended. This will be a keeper.

B00C7JFIRC|5.0|First off see this movie in 3-D; like \\"Avatar\\" it was made to be seen in 3-D.<br /><br />Secondly you may just be surprised that the story, about a charlatan magician (Oscar, a.k.a. \\"Oz\\", played smarmily by James Franco who puts his great smile to good effect) who runs away from his problems in Kansas that he's created for himself, has some nice and sweet echoes within the story itself as the brief time we spend with \\"the great and powerful Oz\\" in Kansas has important ramifications in the wonderland known as Oz.  It's pretty easy to match up the fantasy counterparts to their faux-real world memes within these two worlds.  And though the movie makes light of Franco's philandering ways on the one hand (everything works out in an overall PG way...for him at least who receives nary a scratch or ever shows that he feels bad about himself...which he should) it also shows on the other hand how deceit and the empty promise of love can mar and undo people.  This can certainly give something for the pre-teen and teen set something to talk about, or for parents with their children.<br /><br />The movie is gorgeous, sumptuous, and magical not just in the sense that there is magic in it (a la the witches played by fetching stars Mila Kunis, Rachel Wiesz, and Michelle Williams) but also in the sense that we can experience \\"magic\\" in different forms, from the stage magician deftly deceiving us to the conundrums of scientific principles that dazzle many of us to the sheer magic of being at the movies that we (hopefully) feel from time to time.  Perhaps not unlike the first \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and the effect it had on audiences, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" can too have the effect of making us feel like we're experiencing something new, real, otherwordly and yet terrific at the same time.  4.5 stars.
0312867123|5.0|Before I start, be aware that if you saw [[ASIN:B003PGNBO8 FlashForward: The Complete Series]], the TV show, there are major differences between it and the original book.  And for those who are considering which to see first, make it the book: it does a better, fuller, and more complete job.  PLUS, there are vital differences.<br /><br />The premise: just as the CERN atomic collider in Switzerland \\"fires up,\\" EVERYONE on earth falls asleep for two minutes.  It is during this worldwide \\"sleep\\" that they envision their own future roughly two decades from now.  When they awaken - and not all do - they find a world in severe trauma: during the last couple of unattended minutes a whole plethora of planes have crashed, cars, buses, boats and other vehicles have had accidents, etc, etc.<br /><br />Mind you, the essence of this premonition is not something they determine right away...it takes time for them to determine that their dreams all intertwine, and these dreams seem to be the actual future.  But it is at this point that these visions form the real problem...<br /><br />What is fate, and are our options in the face of it?<br /><br />What follows is an extremely well-depicted investigation of not only free will versus fate, but people's reactions to what they envisioned.  Imagine you saw yourself at your child's wedding, or happily sitting beside a person in a house: wouldn't you immediately set out to find out who those people were?  What if you were married, but saw yourself two decades later with another spouse?  What if your vision was of yourself in jail?  Or a millionaire?<br /><br />One scenario many encountered was related to watching a news report that covered America's president...but that boy was until this vision an average teenager.  Should America set about setting him up with a Secret Service detail?<br /><br />Sawyer examines such idiosyncrasies, and how they affect key characters within the scientific community.  For instance, one character learned of his own murder, and began trying to find the person who killed him...before it occurred.<br /><br />Or what if you dreamt nothing at all...what would that mean?<br /><br />Obviously this is a treasure trove for a good sci-fi writer, and in my opinion they don't get much better than Robert J. Sawyer.  He is not afraid of taking a phenomenon like this and trying to examine it both scientifically AND socially.  Sawyer excels at such tasks, and in one vital aspect therein: making it understandable and meaningful.  Though his books typically concern themselves with heady, intellectual matters, the way they play out is always handled with an eye toward rationality and plausibility.<br /><br />Are we able to escape our own \\"fates\\"?  And what if we WANT them to come about: will our pursuit of such dreams drive them away, since in the original playing out of our lives no such pursuit existed?  Or--if we saw our future lives as tragic--should be become cautious, avoiding all danger, or should we actively alter toward another direction, knowing any course we take may ultimately lead to the same fate anyway?<br /><br />Read FLASHFORWARD, and THEN see the short-lived TV series if you want.  I did, and enjoyed it, and Sawyer himself was pleased with it.  Just realize herein lies the original book, and what follows is - like own own future - not necessarily the same.his own murder, and began trying to find the person who killed him...before it occurred.<br /><br />Or what if you dreamt nothing at all...what would that mean?<br /><br />Obviously this is a treasure trove for a good sci-fi writer, and in my opinion they don't get much better than Robert J.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|I liked them more than the hunger games. The hunger games story we a little more Epic/believable since it's supposed to take place in a post-apocalypitc world whereas these books are pure fantasy, but the author ends them well and makes you want to keep reading. That said, you'd live if you didn't read them. I suppose I'd call them interesting but mediocre. 3 out of 5 stars.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Deep understanding and insight in the characters' soul and personality. His descriptions of sky, sea, clouds, thunders and storms extraordinarily accurate and vivid. Some repetitions create such remarkable realism that one's breath stops. The book is an allegory, a philosophical positioning, exploring first our deepest fears and dealing with them, and ultimately the innate need of every person for searching for meaning and finding God. Gratitude for every moment of illuminating awareness permeates the narration. The last chapters shimmer with intelligence and humor. I do not think I will see the movie as I cannot believe any visual can parallel the intricate nuances of every turn of the page. Congratulations to Mr. Martel!  And thanks.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|She's so GOOD!  Only You (track 4) is AWESOME and I play it on repeat! Her first album was a great debut and it made me interested in her second album.  It's even better than the first!!  You can tell she's really grown as an artist.  The songs are moving, both emotionally and musically.  They have a ton of soul, lots of great riffs, melodies, lyrics, layers, and beats.  There are pop songs, techno inspired dance tracks, and ballads.  It's just a great culmination of her artistry.  It's cathartic to listen to her as she sings her heart out.  Way to go Ellie!  Now if you would just go on tour where I could see you in concert!!!!
0743442539|5.0|when I read Le carre, I feel as if I'm watching a movie. the plot moves along so well that I can't stop reading and I'm just waiting to turn the page and see what the next exciting new development will be. the world of intrigue can be confusing with plots and sub plots and you never know who is real or what is real, but he does a great job of giving background for people who have no knowledge of this world.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Great script and superb acting make for a truly delightful series.  Politics: for the most part, a pathetic enterprise where one's convictions are lost as positions are established based on the desires of  the highest bidders.

B00908DDZM|5.0|This was one of the best album's I've heard in a long time. Great lyrics, solid from beginning to end.
0062020897|5.0|This is the book that \\"made\\" Follett, his first breakout bestseller, and there's no question why that happened once you start to read.<br /><br />In many ways, Eye of the Needle sets the pattern for his most successful efforts other than Pillars of the Earth: a deadly secret, a resourceful navigator of the shadow world of intrigue (sometimes the protagonist, sometimes the villain), at least one determined woman in the thick of it, and multi-party chases set against a ticking clock. All these devices work together seamlessly in this book. Follett even makes the saving-the-D-Day-secret plot thread seem fresh.<br /><br />Follett's WWII-based novels have always felt stronger to me than the others (again, with the exception of Pillars of the Earth); his settings in wartime England and occupied Europe are assured and immersive in a way some of his more modern settings are not. A few familiar tropes sneak in (the tweedy-professor-as-spycatcher, for instance, which Daniel Silva also used in The Unlikely Spy), although in 1978 they weren't as overused as they are now.<br /><br />If you haven't read Follett before, you should start with Eye of the Needle and his next bestsellers, Triple and The Key to Rebecca. If you only know him from Pillars of the Earth, your reaction to these books will depend on whether you enjoy spy thrillers as much as you do multi-generational Medieval epics. In any case, don't turn up your nose at these because they're thirty years old; they'll still show you a good time today.
B00BKW8UA4|5.0|If you're looking for Blackened Sky or VOB look elsewhere. This is a natural evolution of Only Revolutions but builds on its strengths. DO get the deluxe version as the missing 6 tracks from the double UK album are a must have (especially Little Hospitals). Despite arena shows and generally more straightforward songs, Biffy still wield odd time signatures and show how tight they are as a band. HIGHLY recommended.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|the actors for all of the characters were superbly chosen and well-acted.  you really think of Tom hanks as a good-ole American, loyal trustworthy cowboy and tim allen as the brash, delusional upstart toy.

0671449028|5.0|the rhyming books are always fun to read and quick for when you are a sleepy, tired parent. but it's entertaining for the children and it helps remind them of brushing their teeth and that it's fun to get ready for bed.

I tried it for a few minutes, and wasn't terribly impressed, so I uninstalled it and didn't even remember the plot. Sorry for the lackluster review - I felt it was a somewhat lackluster game.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I like this adventure. it's quirky. the hero is kind of an anti-hero. the little boy isn't perfect and good-looking like so many stories. everyone is flawed. and there's also a great sense of loss that is very touching. but it's fun to watch and I think adults and children like the idea of flying away with balloons and fulfilling a life-long dream.

0316228532|5.0|About the Book:<br />In the small town of Pagford, England, Barry Fairbrother drops dead, leaving a seat open in the local council. His death affects the people of Pagford, both directly and indirectly, causing a flourish of gossip and glimpses of what humanity tends to be.<br /><br />Review:<br />When this book originally came out, I had little to no intention of reading it. Even though it was written by J.K. Rowling, I felt like it would have been of little interest to me, but then my friend suggested it to me so I decided to give it a go. I must say that I am entirely glad that I did. To sum it up in one word: wow!<br /><br />Now, I will say that there isn't a lot of plot in this book; it most certainly is a book that focuses on the characters -- nay, people. To say they are simply characters would discredit Rowling's talent. Her creations have so many complexities and layers that the word character doesn't quite hit the mark. Rowling did such a wonderful job of portraying the faults of humanity that I had to stop reading several times due to emotional overload. That's not to say that all the characters are horrible people. Many mean well but end up making bad decisions, and many make decisions based on their wants and needs more than anything else. Now, the drama may be above average (we have physical abuse, drug addicted parents, and suicidal thoughts, for example), but unlike a soap opera, you can find yourself believing all of these situations. It certainly helps that Rowling takes up through the characters' thoughts. Now, one thing that may bother some readers is the constant shifting point of view. Personally, this didn't bother me, and I cannot see the book working as well as it did if she had written it any other way. However, this can be a major turnoff for some readers so I thought it wise to mention it. Honestly, the only problem I had with the work was that it had a slow start. A lot of this had to do with introducing a large cast of characters, but it was certainly a struggle to get through the first hundred pages or so. Still, it was worth it.<br /><br />Before I wrap up this review, I would like to talk about a couple more things that kept surrounding this novel, mostly the language and sex, although the latter isn't in minute detail. Dear god, I have heard so many complaints involving the adult content that I felt the need for a rebuttal of some sort. A lot of people seem to be under the impression that J.K. Rowling upped all the mature content to remove her from Harry Potter. A lot of people have been saying that she is using too much language, too much sex. Bollocks! Now, I am in no way saying that there isn't a lot of foul language and sexual content. Hardly but these people don't seem to realise how much people cuss. Besides it's not like J.K. Rowling is having every single character cuss like a sailor. Guess what? Sex also happens to be a large part of humanity as a whole. Again, not every one of us is driven by our genitals, but at large, humans are very sexual creatures. Yes, we tend to hide it away, but remember that this is a book that is supposed to get inside the characters and show us their secrets. Needless to say, you are bound to get uncivilised acts and language when you are reading a book of this nature. This certainly isn't a book for everyone. However, for those who don't mind some uncouth language and some very real type problems, for those who enjoy character driven books and stories that dig into the crevices of the characters' minds, I could not recommend this book more.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show and cast are just incredible. I am in love with ALL the characters and eagerly await the next season.
B002VE8YLK|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's and the DVD is even better. Brian has an all star cast to accompany this great release. Its like a collaboration of musical geniuses.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|Simply put, this a great little device that gets the job done. 4 GB is more than enough storage for a normal person's everyday use. Whether it be for music, photos, documents, whatever you need it to do, it'll store your stuff, and you'll still have some room left over for some other files, provided you clean it out every now and then. I use this for school, and it's small enough to be thrown into my backpack with the pens/pencils, but big enough that it doesn't get lost. Or you can throw a keyring on it, and you can keep it on your keychain!<br />Two thumbs up, and definitely recommend this!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am late to catch on to Downton Abbey fever, but now that I have, I could not be more happy. This is the classiest soap opera I have ever seen. Everything that is good about television has been put into this series. I am happy to have access to it now, anytime I choose.
B00008G9JM|5.0|Face it, you're probably of an age to recognize this band & the impact they had. When your parents criticized you for loudly playing Blue Cheer, you would pull out these guys & quiet them. This was an amazing band,ahead of the &#34;rock'n'nroll&#34; curve, but sadly this record (remember records?) didn't sell well. Years later, it's better received & something you could even play for children. THIS disc even has the video performance of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles &#60;snorts&#62; viewable on a computer. It's great music at a good price.

1400069807|5.0|I read this on audiobook, so I can't share with you the many terrifying statistics and sad stories that make this book so compelling.  In a way, it's probably nothing you haven't heard before - America has an obesity crisis, and most of the sugar, salt, and fat that Americans eat comes from processed foods.  From breakfast cereals that have more sugar than most desserts to frozen dinners that contain more than 2 days worth of sodium to meats with significant amounts of saturated fats, we are eating ourselves into a very dangerous place.<br /><br />It may sound like this book is written like an alarm bell, filling your eyes and ears with statistics and dry facts that frighten you but are also boring and hard to digest.  This is not the case at all.  Moss is a fantastic writer.  He has amazing sources from all over the food spectrum - he interviews Howard Moskowitz, the man behind the recent successes of both Prego and Dr. Pepper.  He goes into a research laboratory and learns that humans have no upper limit to the amount of fat they crave.  He tells us that what we know about the different areas of the tongue being sensitive to different tastes is wrong - the entire tongue is sensitive to sugar and wants more of it.  He mentions that while it's not too hard to cure an addiction to sodium, just by decreasing the amount of sodium you ingest over a few weeks, it's not nearly as easy to curb cravings for sugar or fat.  As soon as you taste sugar again, you want more of it.  And there are no warnings that come from your brain telling you that you've had enough fat.<br /><br />Moss shares both the science behind and the impact caused by processed foods - how companies spend years on formulations that are exactly what people want to taste, how their drive for profits often comes at the expense of nutrition, and how the government that should be a consumer advocate is instead highly ineffective and often more in line with the dairy and meat lobbies than with consumers.<br /><br />The last food book I read that had an impact on me was Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, which I really enjoyed, though found a bit preachy.  Having read Salt Sugar Fat, I must say I prefer Moss' book.  He is much more realistic in his approach, acknowledging just how good processed foods can taste, and just how much time they save us in a day.  He also points out that food companies exist to make money, not to make people healthier.  Moss isn't preachy, he's realistic.  But he's also frustrated.  It isn't right that beef can tout its protein and zinc levels on the front label without mentioning anything about the amount of fat.  It's not okay that Frosted Mini Wheats can be marketed as good for memory and say nothing about the high sugar content.  It's all a very messy and misleading way of sharing (or hiding) information, meaning that people can think that they are buying healthy food when they really are doing just the opposite.<br /><br />This was a really good book.  The underlying information - that we consume too much sugar, salt, and fat to be healthy - is not groundbreaking, but the case studies and interviews and background information are all fascinating and will change the way you look at the American food system.  Highly recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. It does what it says it would do. My kids use the app when they need it.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|There is nothing a history buff likes better than a movie that caters to him. That is exactly what this film does.Attention is paid to every last detail and while the movie appears dark, we must not forget that without electricity available for indoor living, that is probably what it looked like. Daniel Day-Lewis is so believable as the president and Sally Field is Mary Todd Lincoln. Brilliant performances by James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones and Hal Holbrook, just to name a few, cannot go without a mention as well. There just are not enough words to praise this accurate portrayal of a moment in the past. I loved it. It is an honor to own it on my laptop.

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I just love this sires! It's so interesting and its just amazing! I can't wait to read the 3rd book! I bet its just as great!
B008602KQI|1.0|Most book to movie translations fail because the filmmakers miss the powerful thematic points that made the book so successful.  This is one of those movies.  The ideas presented in this film basically break down into a simple coming of age/rebel against the system tale yet this movie manages to exert none of the really big themes relevant to the powerful themes of the book.  The heroes end up in exactly the same place the movie started.  Not a single character grew from their experiences, no one rebelled against the system in any meaningful way, and all ended well.  This was a real disappointment.<br /><br />Cinematically it was hard to watch.  They went for 'hand-held' style inspired, I'm sure, by 'The Blair Witch'.  As a fan of the 'hand-held' look, this was just a bit too much for me to handle- even 'Saving Private Ryan' managed a nice blend of slow and steady with frenetic 'hand-held'.  There are several shots in which people are sitting still or not moving while the camera flails about.<br /><br />All that said, I was definitely impressed by the actors themselves.  They delivered lines that otherwise would have fallen flat or gone the route of dramatic cheese with a touch of grace.

B00BM1AJIO|4.0|This game is really enjoyable to play on my Kindle Fire. It was pleasant to play a game that responded so well to my touch. I have been really frustrated with other games because the response time to my touch was either incredibly slow or non-existent. I hope the rest of the game will be just as fun as the first half...

B004CFBMRY|5.0|So inspiring..! Great book! Made me think about my own lifestyle and health conditions, as well as about my values and priorities!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I thought this movie was supposed to be a comedy but I never laughed throughout the movie.  It was boring, not funny and not well done.
B009QW7MQS|4.0|Do not expect this movie to be a majestic story or an epic tale that will make you rethink your life. Instead, expect to have a good time watching this Bond flick. The action is there, the Bond gadgets are there, the girls are there. It is a Bond movie and is entertaining. Is is the best Bond movie? Not really. Elliot Carver's quest to take over the world with the media is a little insane to unbelievable, but that is just part of what makes Bond movies what they are. The old style outlandish villains are gone with today's movie and it's good to see it here.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|If you are in the mood for an entertaining, romantic and suspenseful book along the lines of a demon infested (God/Devil themed) Harry Potter meets Blade story than this is a series for you and this first book is an fun beginning.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is simply addictive, because you want to know what happens next every time you finish one of the books in th trilogy. In fifty shades darker Anna continues to frustrate the readers with her insecurities.Christian continues to annoy with his arrogance and extreme jealousy. At the same time, both of them are charming with their intense feelings of love and attachment and sensuality. In addition, you can't stop grinning like an idiot at their emails and conversations, and think how stupidly totally cute they are. To sum it up, it is a good read, and that is all. Of course I would like to watch the promised movie, but I am not going to read the books again. I mean I tried, but I realized that there isn't much to read besides the hot scenes, and even those are passable after reading them once. So it is good and enjoyable as long as it goes on, and when you finish reading the trilogy you are really done with it, and all you want is to move on to something else .

B008CJ0KBU|1.0|I think it is stupid! I just cannot get into it! Where was it filmed? It is very unbelievable, and just not any great acting! Boring. Very disappointed. I would not recommend it. and I really would have liked to find something a lot better! Now, I have nothing good to watch!

B001TH16DI|5.0|For fans of the original Star Trek series and the characters that were part of it, this Blu-Ray collection of six movies plus a bonus disk offers unmatched Trekkie immersion.  On the bonus disk, Whoopie Goldberg, who successfully invited herself into the TV series and played the role of the mysterious Guynan, the counselor/bartender in the starship's Ten Forward lounge, spends more than an hour chatting with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Johnathan Frakes and Patrick Stewart.  This bonus disk is a rare opportunity to see the stars all together and out-of-character, speaking candidly about their real-life adventures that resulted from being in the Star Trek series and in the movies.  I found the conversations fascinating.<br /><br />Often single-title Blu-Ray packages have both a Blu-Ray and standard DVD plus the ability to digitally download the movie onto a portable device.  This collection includes ONLY Blu-Ray disks and no downloads.  Briefly Amazon offered this collection for just $34.99, which worked out to be less than $5 per disk, so I quickly bought this collection for my movie library.<br /><br />Aside from the compact but attractive packaging, I found the digital reproduction of these movies on a 1080p screen quite satisfying, giving me all of the detail that I could ever want.  Although I don't have a surround sound system, my movie audio does go through a high-quality receiver that feeds two excellent full-range speaker systems.  I found the sound quality as satisfying as the video reproduction.  In summary, if you're a fan of the Star Trek original cast and their six movies and wish to enjoy them with crystal clear video and sound reproduction I don't believe that it will get any better than this for the money.
B000059XUP|5.0|liked this movie pretty good I bought the first ones and am trying to get salvation thank you very much
B009LDMJBU|5.0|just purchase this CD..I've been an EROS fan for along time and really appreciate so many of his songs/cds..He is a true artist/performer/poet....I've only listened to this particular cd a couple of times now, but I can already tell that it is a HIT...Like most of his other works there is a lot of 'differences' throughout the CD (tempo/backgrd sound and singers/moods) Just Great! He has the ability to convey a lot of feeling, even to those that can't understand Italian. So glad to have some new EROS!<br /><br />I'm attempting to find a DVD of his 'Live in Roma' , but they all seem to be coded for PAL standard players which my main TV player doesn't handle..Any suggestions/help would be appreciated??

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Not a critic, just a huge fan of nearly all BBC series.  They are done so well with such classic actors.  Real talent and real story lines. Characters so well developed so that you are interested in what happens to each and ever one, minute by minute. You hope the stories go on & on and never end because when they do you feel like you've lost good friends..

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Another outstanding read in the series....absolute must to start at the beginning with Outlander.  Although these books are lengthy, it is fun to come back into the story after a respite.  Enjoy!!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I really did like this book.  When I first started reading about the long tongue and no thumbs, I began to think I wasn't going to finish the book.  What a surprise when - although I learned a lot more about racing that I ever thought I wanted to know - I thoroughly enjoyed the story, sad as it was in parts.  As I learned about the in-laws I grew angry and almost cried.  The wicked floppy top of a teenager was a real plot thickener.  The ending was a joyful surprise, and I fell in love with Enzio!
B0002CTSTK|5.0|this was really neat i liked it a lot I had part one thank you very much it was a good movie

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|First of all, this film is amazing.  For anyone who thinks otherwise, well, now you know not to bother with parts 2 & 3 (and save us from reading more ridiculous reviews).  For the majority of the world who can't get enough of Jackson's brilliant epic, rest assured that this 3D Blu Ray release it absolutely gorgeous.  I have never watched a 3D Blu Ray before, and up until recently had only seen the 3D demos in my local Best Buy, with beat up 3D glasses and equipment.  However, a few weeks back I purchased a new 60\\" 3D-enabled Samsung Smart TV, and the first Blu Ray I purchased as to test drive the 3D feature was The Hobbit.<br /><br />I can safely tell you that if you want to experience this 3D Blu Ray in all its brilliant glory, you should have a decent quality 3D television.  The bigger the screen, perhaps the better the quality of the 3D image.  On my 60\\", I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the clarity and depth that the 3D provided.  I always viewed 3D as a gimmick that was best used when you wanted things to jump out at the audience, or to provide a cheap jolt now and again.  What I have come to realize, from watching The Hobbit, Avatar, and a few select others is that the 3D opens up the entire image to the point that you feel as if you could jump through the screen, and with regards to the The Hobbit in particular, straight into Middle Earth.  The image was that sharp, and the depth was that great.  I also want to point out that the 3D glasses were much nicer than I expected.  I always thought they would be huge and bulky, but they are in fact very light and non-intrusive.  As I have told anyone who would listen, I would certainly prefer to watch The Hobbit in 3D whenever possible, rather than in 2D.  The only disappointing aspect was the fact that the film is split up onto two discs.  It's a minor inconvenience, but I did want to point it out.  That said, having originally been one of those who despised the idea of 3D in the theater, I now believe that if it is used PROPERLY, and SPARINGLY (meaning not just added in post production to crappy movies simply as a gimmick to get people in the seats), then 3D can add a tremendous amount to the experience of watching a great movie, either in the theater or at home.<br /><br />Finally, I want to comment on those who feel that Warner Bros. is \\"sticking it\\" to their customers by \\"double dipping.\\"  First of all, there are actually people who might prefer the theatrical cut to any future extended edition.  Therefore, why would you NOT start by releasing the theatrical version?  Also, believe it or not Warner Bros. is in the business of making money, so to release the extended edition around the holidays makes sense.  It also builds anticipation for part 2.  I'm sure it can be frustrating for some, but it's a joke that people give 1-star ratings due to the fact that WB doesn't just throw everything out there for us on day one.  I have always been a huge fan of the way that WB tries to deliver quality content, as I am sure it's hard to satisfy everyone.  So in conclusion, I thought that the Hobbit was amazing in 3D while it was in theaters, and I can tell you that it is equally amazing on a good 3D TV.  If you have a nice setup, and are a fan of the film, go ahead and grab it (then grab the extended edition later in the year, since I am of the opinion that both versions are a must-have).  Thanks for reading, and enjoy the rest of this incredible ride!used PROPERLY, and SPARINGLY (meaning not just added in post production to crappy movies simply as a gimmick to get people in the seats), then 3D can add a tremendous amount to the experience of watching a great movie, either in the theater or at home.<br /><br />Finally, I want to comment on those who feel that Warner Bros. is \\"sticking it\\" to their customers by \\"double dipping.\\"  First of all, there are actually people who might prefer the theatrical cut to any future extended edition.

B0067R0APK|1.0|The new update is horrible. The graphics are awful and it doesn't even fit the screen.  Way to go ruining your app that I purchased.  Do I get the option of a refund?
B001EC2IV2|4.0|I liked many of the action scenes, and most of the story. A few flaws but a fun watch.<br />Arnold is pretty good in this one.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|this great for pranks you can use your kindle fire or laptop and attach it to you stereo and it scares them or leave it at your house when only one person is home and start playing scary stuff.
0131480057|5.0|As a 19 year old, I can't exactly compare to some of the credits the other reviewers possess when they describe the accuracy and helpfulness of this book. However I can tell you this:<br /><br />There are good points in here even if your trying to get into Linux Administration, the book is easy to follow along. It separates several main topics into chapters in themselves: Adding and removing users, Networking, Security, Shell Scripting, Server Hardware, etc. This book is even incredibly beneficial just a desk reference, because its all in the context of system administration.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book, I think it has something for everybody and for the price it really does encompass a lot of information.

B00BL5EQLC|4.0|The art is good, the training interface is very good, but sometimes the puzzles are a bit hard to figure out. Also, while the art is good, there isn't enough of it. It still fails to feel steampunky because there just aren't enough shiny bits and doodads everywhere.

B0098460O4|5.0|Happy to have added this album to my collection. Jonathan has the ability to destroy anyone else on stage with him. Hard to say where he'll end up.
B008602KQI|3.0|I feel like this was a book that was fairly widely read and so the movie should've attempted to stick to the story as much as possible. To that end, a few things were missing from the movie that bothered me. First, the entire AVOX subplot is missing. This added to how evil we see the capital as being, and it was noticeably missing. Second, they don't even bother to show all the contestants at the beginning of the hunger games. There are only 20 people standing there and there should be 24. Finally, the different origin of the mocking jay pin was a bit annoying.
B005N95JA4|5.0|I feel this Stones Album/CD was their comeback when it was released.  I already owned it but bought because of the Deluxe Edition.
B002SWVC64|5.0|I used to own this dvd and must have watched it a dozen times. The other night I rented it and it's a classic. Julia Roberts is so good in this, the script is fantastic, and Albert Finney, of course, is brilliant. True story, very moving, and as pertinent today -- more so -- than ever. Really, I love this movie. So inspiring.

B00BESLHEA|1.0|First: The actor narrating could barely pronounce the English language!<br />Second: The fight scenes didn't do the &#34;Kung Fu&#34; genre any justice!<br />Third: The acting was the best part even though it was so absurd due the influence of Mr. Moran Quentin Tarantino!.<br />Fourth: The locations and sets looked as though they were in a fifties western studio back lot If intentional another moronic move from Tarantino!<br />Never recommend this movie to even the dire hard Kung Fu fans!<br />A hour and half of my life that I will never get back! Complete waste of money.<br />What the hell happened to you Quentin Tarantino? You started off with such promise and originality!!!!!!
B0011UF79C|5.0|I already owned this movie and bought this because of the (Special Edition)  It's an excellent movie.  One of my favs.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is definitely one to add to a dvd library. The songs are catchy, the actors are perfectly cast, and it is simply a feel-good movie.

B005CA4SL0|5.0|I think this is one of De Niro's top 3 performances and I believe he should have gotten the Oscar over Anthony Hopkins for best actor. This is not your typical Scorsese movie, but it does bear his distinctive touch to the framing and cinematography. The whole cast turns in solid performances, and Nick Nolte is actually really well-cast as the protagonist. The story is presented convincingly and has a very noticeably unsettled feeling throughout. The build-up is very exciting and from the opening scene you will be on the edge of your seat! Highly recommend for suspense-junkies!

0670026603|1.0|As someone who has lived the wife/caregiver role (as opposed to cruising online chat rooms for drama fodder) I have to say that this is one of the most depressingly off-the-mark books I've read in a long, long time.<br /><br />Ms. Moyes is a good writer, in the sense that she has an ear for dialogue and a great sense of pacing. She's not remotely qualified to talk about spinal cord injury, though -- what she's done here is exploitive and wrong. It's a misuse of her talent.<br /><br />The idea that a writer could \\"do research\\" by eavesdropping on the conversations of people who actually confront life with a disability and then sanitize that world into an emotional & cathartic event for outsiders is beyond offensive.  Yes, there are chatrooms. Yes, they're open to the public. No, they're not there for people who fancy themselves researchers to lurk around in, looking for high-quality details that will add verisimilitude to their novels.<br /><br />I'm saying, some of us live with the reality of this injury all the time and manage not to slash our wrists over it.<br /><br />When you make drama out of other peoples' pain, you ought not to patronize them in the process. At the very least, you ought to find out the basic medical information. Is there such a thing as a C-11, C-12 spinal cord injury?<br /><br />Only in Me Before You. (In the real world the lowest C injury is a C-7.)<br />Which makes me want to write a subtitle: Jojo Moyes Before Anybody with a Disability . . .<br /><br />Whatever. I recommend her book to people who like good drama and don't care if it represents real life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:143030796X Some Things Are Unbreakable]]

B005H7WDTC|5.0|Just as Beethoven's nine symphonies are the standard against which all subsequent symphonies were measured, this set of recordings from the Vienna Philharmonic is the video production against which all classical music videos can be measured. Available as three individual discs (symphonies 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9) or a complete nine-symphony boxed set, these recordings establish a standard for excellence that has few peers.  The viewer is treated to state-of-the-art 5.0 surround sound, presenting the justifiably most famous symphonic compositions in the repertoire, performed by one of the best orchestras in the world, as interpreted under the inspired direction of Christian Thielemann.  The venue is the Golden Hall of the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, reputedly one of the half-dozen best orchestral recording sites in the world. Despite Amazon's indication that there are no special features on these discs, there are in fact nine significant special features, namely one-hour discussions between conductor Thielemann and noted musical critic and historian Joachim Kaiser concerning each of the nine symphonies. The discussions are in German, with subtitles available in eight languages.    Beyond the superb quality of the sound, there is also video which I personally have never seen equaled, with camera work and editing that bring an intimate view of an orchestra at work. (Update: superb video images and editing are becoming more common. The San Francisco Symphony's recording of Berlioz' \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\" is equally stunning in its video quality.)   A lifetime of attendance at classical concerts would not give the insight into the creation of magnificent music that is afforded by these discs. A viewer gets to know the orchestra members as individuals, with the video highlighting groups or single players as their specific moments arrive in the score.  Detail is amazingly acute, showing every hair, wrinkle and bead of perspiration. Intimate moments abound, almost allof which would be invisible from the seats of the concert hall: the red faces of the oboe and bassoon players during a prolonged solo, the rapturous smiles or knitted-brow concentration of the string players, the swinging and swaying of the two clarinetists who look like they are playing in a jazz band, and the slightly bemused expression of the concert master when one of the horsehairs in his bow breaks and waves in time with the music.    This is music to be re-visited often, and fortunately the quality of the video component is such that it too is a delight to view over and over.  All of Beethoven's symphonies are enjoyable, and listening to each of them in sequence provides some understanding of the growth of his prodigious musical powers, with the music becoming more complex and the orchestra larger.  Each of the three discs contains at least one \\"blockbuster\\" symphony that is familiar even to those who are only casually interested in classical music: on the first disc is the breakthrough Third Symphony, the \\"Eroica\\", twice as long as the previous symphonies; disc two has both the Fifth Symphony with its famous four-note \\"Fate\\" theme and the Sixth or Pastoral Symphony; and the third disc has the monumental Ninth Symphony which includes the \\"Ode to Joy\\".    As one who already had several complete LP and CD sets of Beethoven's symphonies, I can state that this rendition has become my favorite, regardless of whether I am watching the masterful video or merely listening to the glorious sound.  I took a deep breath before I bought this set, as it was a significant investment.  It was one of the best purchases I have ever made.

B00B6QXN56|5.0|\\"American bluesman Joe Bonamassa hasn't released anything in six months after a year in 2012 where he only put out two studio albums and two live albums (one of each with Black Country Communion and one of each solo). So to fill the gap between the last live album Beacon Theatre: Live From New York and the next studio album comes this recording from the short European acoustic tour he did between in the Summer between electric tours.\\" Joe you are a machine. Joe Bonamassa is surely one of the hardest working musicians around.<br /><br />\\"Initially it was thought that Bonamassa would play a solo set and give a brief intro to each song, making it incredibly personal and intimate to the audience. However, a motley band of five was eventually opted for and it was equipped with a variety of uncommon and peculiar instruments, a good decision.\\" Simple but effective at producing the particular sound the player wants, these varied instruments complement the overall JB performance.<br /><br />Joe does a remarkable job of touching upon most of his solo discography within this performance. Joe's playing is complemented by a talented ensemble of players. Joining him on violin and Irish banjo (Gerry O'Connor), washboard/percussion (Lenny Castro), piano, accordion,and glockenspiel (Arlan Schierbaum) and nyckelharpa(key harp) and mandola (Mats Wester).<br /><br />There were several standout songs from the 21 classic tracks that were performed. \\"Slow Train,\\" which kept the foot stomping, \\"The Ballad Of John Henry\\" shedding the hefty electric guitar licks but still one of the most blistering in JB's arsenal, \\"Dust Bowl\\" is transformed by the introduction of unique sounds of Mats Wester on the nyckelharpa and Gerry O'Conner on the mandolin, Bonamassa's voice really comes to the forefront, delicately smooth then cascading into a mighty wail. I have always been a great lover of his version of \\"Stones In My Passway\\" and his slide here is sweetly sublime.<br /><br />JB is a truly great guitarist, he plays almost incessantly and on this CD there is no shortage of guitar. Bonamassa's vocals are always superb but hearing him working in an acoustic setting allows his voice to be more expressive. He sounds comfortable in this setting, perhaps even almost a little liberated.<br /><br />Fans will go nuts over this album. I'm very glad that I purchased this acoustic album as it really is such a good listen. \\"Every track a winner, brought to fruition with calm, even handed professionalism full of warmth and emotion. Best album of 2013...so far!\\"<br /><br />Can't wait til Beth Hart and Joes new album comes out this May, should be another winner.

0062124293|5.0|\\"How To Be a Woman\\" by Caitlin Moran should be in the hands of every woman and girl, from Age 13 up.  It's Moran's mission to take feminism from the realm of academic and bring it into the conversation of Everywoman.  Feminism is what we live as women; it isn't some lofty academic theory.<br /><br />\\"How To Be a Woman\\" is funny, thought-provoking, and sure, at times profane, but I stick by my recommendation that every woman should read this book with an open mind and get over the priggishness over \\"bad words.\\"  This book could open up so many meaningful real-life discussions and the more memoiresque bits could help those adolescent young women who are struggling with their new bodies, their new hormones, their new identity know that their bewilderment won't last forever, that eventually, they'll figure out \\"how to be a woman\\" in the scope of what that means to them. They need to read this book, even if it's just to get themselves THINKING.<br /><br />I liked the British tone of this book.  I think especially here in the States, that tone adds to it.  There were some things I needed to ask my smart classmate Google (\\"Psssssssst, Google!  Who's Katie Price?\\", for instance), but over all, Moran's words translate from her side of the pond to ours.  I wish the feminist theory books I read in college and graduate school could have been as fun as \\"How To Be a Woman\\" is.  Because I think sometimes people who don't identify as \\"feminist\\" see those who do as brittle, defensive, raw, exposed nerves who spell \\"woman\\" as \\"womyn\\" and who hate men.  That isn't what being a feminist is all about.  And if there were more books on feminism like Caitlyn Moran's, books that show you can be a feminist AND like men AND have a sense of humor about it all, I think we'd see the movement break the stall it's in.<br /><br />Get it.  Read it with an open mind.  Share it with your friends. Discuss.  We need more books like this for girls and women to read!

B00C7LB20C|3.0|Hubby and I wanted to watch a new movie, preferably an action adventure thriller to get our heart rates up a bit, because we're sick at home and in need of entertainment capable of counteracting our lethargy. Some people might balk at the more expensive rental fee, but it's cheaper than two theater tickets and we could stay under the covers with hot tea in hand. Perhaps Erased is not as good as The Bourne Identity or Taken, but it's still an interesting intelligence movie and worth the price.

B0000T70K4|5.0|This is probably the lowest rated book I have ever decided to pick up despite such wishy-washy reviews from the Amazon community - who have steered me right more times than not. I have always had an affinity for stories about self-destructive, existential crises and I am naturally drawn to stories that take place in one day; where the reader is given a brief snapshot of the protagonist's life and their complete meltdown. Upon occasion, they rise up to overcome life's adversity. On others, they cling frantically to the lifeboat of humanity, only to suffocate slowly beneath the surface, watching the rest of the world carry forward. Sometimes a lesson is learned. To avoid a huge spoiler, I'll refrain from stating which category `Cosmopolis' falls into.<br /><br />'Cosmopolis' should be to the Occupy Wall St movement what `On the Road' was to beatniks. What I found fascinating was the book's underlying themes - the masses rejecting the current Western economies of scale, filled with corruption within the world of high finance, the disparity of resources amongst the ultra wealthy and the downtrodden, and a species' value system that has been turned topsy-turvy; all of which existed in DeLillo's world nearly ten years before the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement. In fact, in retrospect, many of these underlying themes existed throughout the second half of the 20th century (I can remember thinking bankers sucked after watching `It's a Wonderful Life' as a child). Maybe it's today's collective pessimism towards government and institutional agencies that reflect in a culture's art. It is only after a near cataclysmic event, such as the financial collapse in 2008,  that we all stop, take notice and ask ourselves, \\"What exactly are the Master's of the Universe up to?\\"<br /><br />Working within the financial world, I wish I could say Eric Packer, the story's protagonist, reminds me of myself - the self-made billionaire, exploiting market hiccups created by geo-political whirlwinds, and stepping on the heads on the less docile competition - the analytical prodigy brain of Bill Gates coupled with the alpha brawn sex appeal of Tom Brady. Where industry-swiping decisions are made and pointless dribble is relegated to an army of minions. In reality, I can relate to the character of Benno much more easily - a disgruntle ex-employee (or the more PC morale-sensitive term `associate' used in mega corporations) who represents the forgotten man and his failure to successfully navigate within the leviathan of commerce and climb the corporate ladder. Where decisions and opinions are marginalized by middle management and resorting to man's primordial urge for violence is the only solution to level the playing field. He has the intelligence of Hannibal Lecter and the passion of Holden Caulfield.<br /><br />'Cosmopolis' has one of those plots that sounds weak or trite when explained to a friend. In short, it really is about a guy taking a mundane car ride to get a haircut. \\"Wow. Sold. I must read that.\\" But, my passion for this book obviously stems from a much more layered, complex piece of literature. It is facetted on a, ...what's the old Churchill saying - a riddle wrapped in an enigma? And I think you either trying get what DeLillo is saying or you don't.<br /><br />The book is mainly constructed of thought-provoking dialogue between characters that often seem too witty and wise to seem believable, staggered around small bits of action that move the story along. But it works. I mean how inefficient could DeLillo be when writing a 200 page book that takes place within 24 hours? Packer's consultants specialize on various topics from network security to the theory of currency. Their philosophical tirades, on subjects ranging from the time/money principle to the affects of cyber capital, in conjunction with true currency hedging scenarios are what made me fall in love with this book.<br /><br />I read somewhere that DeLillo's characters talk around each other, not to each other. I can dig that. Again, it works. At times, it feels as if the dialogue is moving the storyline along and at other times, it feels like extra vignettes that numb the neural cortex. But I can see how this would frustrate some readers; especially if you're a very plot-driven person. Personally, if the subject matter was anything else, I would have found myself irritated.<br /><br />Is capitalism within its final death throes? I don't think so. But then again, that is why I read fiction; mostly science fiction - to test human nature in extreme situations. What I find interesting is this fictitious backdrop almost became reality.  If you're a fan of destroying the entire system and starting over, or even simply exploring the mindset of societies upper echelon, read `Cosmopolis'.<br /><br />I'll admit; I've always wanted to read DeLillo, specifically `Underworld', but I was subjected to the movie starring everyone's favorite vampire hunk first. The film's dialogue and the antihero's self-destruction struck a raw nerve and I had a feeling that it was one of those works that simply wouldn't transfer from paper to film that well. It was a mere coincidence that my local used book store had it on sale for $5. After reading it - it was a definite score.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's pretty sweet, I liked it a lot. Late at night, while drinking beer. Mmm... Beer. Beer and walking dead make me happy.
B00ARX2W24|3.0|* Purchased the CD basically because back in the day I was a Herb Albert fan, still is. I guess in listening I was trying to compair this cd to the ones of old and it just did not compair to the music Herb put out in the 70's-80's.<br /><br />* Did not get into this particular music, liking ok<br /><br />* For those who love to listen to this particular type of music, I have no problem recommending
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|love it. great game I hope they make more updates really fun I really recommend to anyone who likes fantasy games with zombies
1442419814|4.0|Tally Youngblood is only months away from turning 16, from turning pretty. In her world, all 16 year-olds get plastic surgery to become perfect, so that way everyone is equal. Her best friend Peris just had his surgery and went to live in New Pretty Town, so Tally is bored and alone, living with the rest of the uglies. That is, until she meets Shay.<br /><br />Shay teaches her how to hover-board and the two escape to the Rusty Ruins (the shell of old New York) to waste time. But Shay is different because she doesn't want to become pretty. In fact, there is a whole group of people who never get the surgery and who live in the wild in a settlement called The Smoke.<br /><br />Tally finds herself stuck between two worlds, wishing desperately to be pretty but wanting to protect her new friend. This alternate-universe story is more entertainment than social commentary, but it gets a few good jabs at the definition of beauty and at the wastefulness of our current society.<br /><br />The story ends at the beginning of a new arc, which makes it necessary to continue reading the series.<br /><br />I have long felt that I was above reading young adult fiction because I have grown out of it, but this creative idea made me want to revert back to my teen days, and I'm glad I did. While this story didn't make me think, I wholly enjoyed myself as I raced through reading and couldn't wait to get my hands on the sequel.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|One of the funnest, most addictive games I've ever played.  Huge world, tons to do, I really can't stop playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun to play for all age's. And you when u fist see it your like omg. What is this. Hope y'all enjoy this. Game
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|Very poor condition! Paid for a brand new unused cd and cd case was cracked in many places. Would like to have a new one at no charge and no charge to ship back
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|A great Social Commentary!  That's right.  This was a satire of the corruption of politics, media and ultimately,  society itself.  The story is so well done,  and the characters are so well written.  Ahh,  Billy Flynn,  Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly.  The trio you just love to hate.  I especially loved the 'Razzle Dazzle' sequence.  You can just feel the sheer disgust the writer had for these characters,  who were based off of real people and real situations.  And best of all,  this story is every bit as relevant today,  as society has not changed in the slightest bit!
0765348276|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Original, thoughtful, action-packed, witty, humorous, intriguing. I would put him closer to Lois McMaster Bujold than to Robert Heinlein.
B002APU580|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. Wish they would make the other Jane Austen books to the same standard. The actors and actresses were cast correctly. What ruined Sense and Sensibility for me was the age of Emma Thompson playing the part  meant for a much younger person. I hope they remake all of the Jane Austen books into movies this good.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I love so simple and easy so tranfer back and forth :O lovely!<br /><br />Easy system organization<br /><br />Me gusto muy sencillo y facil de usar interactivo , sincronizacion sencilla y facil de usar m subir bajar etc.
B00A3AYI50|2.0|The rest of the album is a like one boring poorly-written song that was written in Hollywood.  It sounds like a teeny-show soundtrack.  Total waste of money.  I bought it for &#34;Home&#34;, as the composing was a bit original and the engineering is pretty good, and dude has a decent voice.  His talent could easily be brought to bear with some decent material....damn Hollywood gets in the way of talent again!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Loved it - back to John Perry's ironic wit, many unexpected plot-twists and a thoughtful ending. But what happened to the werewolves?
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a fun game but sometimes I accidentally deleted it and downloaded a shine but it restarted higher rate if remember
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|The first time I played free and had a real tough time.  Was glad to purchase and play in full.<br />Great graphics and good story...Best of all great help if needed.  Do be thorough on<br />all find the object and rooms.  Good purchase...worth it.
B0031RS69G|2.0|I had high hopes for this book and this series. But I was disappointed. The only reason I kept on reading was because I wanted the story to surprise me. I gave it every chance to wow me but it fell short.<br />I wanted to like the story despite the many weird turns of events. I wanted to find Rincewind, the almost wizard, funny and lovable. I wanted to ignore the never ending geographical, meteorological, spatial quirks of the Discworld. I didn't succeed in any of those things.<br />Needless to say I will not be reading the rest of the series.<br />So long Discworld. This is where our brief relationship ends. It's not you, it's me.
B00433TO52|5.0|so love this book with all of his tragedies and plays so lone shakspeardo not hav anythang else to say
B000MQRE4C|5.0|It is a great period piece .. it is timeless film making ... excellent work ... interest was held throughout the entire film.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|if you want to play card games with these cards go ahead, but I recommend just collecting them as souvenirs if you're a true LOZ fan, and not bending and ruining them
B008UX2UIO|1.0|I'm having a hard time trying to classify this book.  It's not drama, mystery, it's certainly not comedy. Well, maybe it is mystery. The mystery being how can this book get such a high rating?<br /><br />I found this book totally absurd. Every single character is caricatured to the extreme. Maybe that's the way it was meant to be, but it did not appeal to me at all.<br /><br />The main character, Ignatius Jacques Reilly is an elephantesque, whiny slob. Not one character is believable and the story, even less.<br /><br />I'm sure there was meant to be a message on society somewhere in there, but the only message I got was: Put this book down.<br /><br />The book's only redeeming quality is the writing. I love how Toole played with words and descriptions.<br /><br />Describing dust bunnies as \\"little spherical formations of lint\\" or \\" Miss Trixie was never perfectly vertical; she and the floor always met at an angle of less than ninety degrees\\" brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />I especially liked how he nailed the New Orleans accent in writing. I could \\"hear\\" the accent just reading the words on the page.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this book is the story of how it came to be published (which you can read in the foreword of the book itself), which is ironic because in my humble opinion, it never should have...
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie. I rented it one night when my husband was out of town. I fell in love with it! I could watch it everyday...and wish I could sing as good as them
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Charlize Theron gives an excellent performance .... Kristen Stewart was adequate but fails to bring something completely different to the role so as to shake off her Twilight character.  It would be much more pleasing to the viewer to get a completely new experience with her and not be constantly reminded in small ways due to her acting approach/technique, of Bella.
B000VHVGM8|5.0|I bought this one years ago, and loved watching it again on my ipad.  Very funny.  The entire cast did an outstanding job.
B006N57PXG|5.0|This is the story of Nathaniel, a young and ambitious magician in training, whose master is mediocre at best and loathes Nathaniel.<br />Because Nathaniel is impatient and too smart for his own good, he decides to take his training further, without his master's knowledge, and summons Bartimaeus, a djinni from the \\"Other Place\\" and that's when the trouble starts.<br /><br />This is Harry Potter meets Aahz (for those of you familiar with the M.Y.T.H series by Robert Asprin and well, Harry Potter). It sounds like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, been-there-read-that kind of story but Stroud came up with a well crafted work that brings a bit of novelty to the genre.<br /><br />Bartimaeus (or Barty, as I like to call him) is absolutely hilarious. His chapters are written in the first person and he is not sparing with his opinions. He's been around for 5000 years and he's pretty full of himself.<br />My only complaint is the author's excessive use of footnotes in the Barty chapters. Although most of them are hilarious and worth reading, I feel a lot of them could have easily been incorporated in the text itself, instead of having the reader going back and forth to read them. Especially since I read it on Kindle and it took me a while to get the hang of reading the footnotes and coming back to the text afterwards. But my own dorkiness is hardly the author's fault.<br /><br />So now, as is always the risk when reading the first book of a series (that I got as a freebie on Amazon), I find myself hooked and in a bit of Barty humor withdrawal syndrome. Guess I'm going to have to shell out the 7$ to get the second book, which I will do gladly :)
B0064QNS62|3.0|I have completed the 4th level ... can't see anything that hasn't been accomplished BUT the game doesn't put me in the fifth level.  Are there ways to find out how to accomplish things.  The instructions are really sketchy.  Used to play Pokeman and Spyro with my grandson and we bought books to show how to accomplish things when we had a problem.  If someone can help me ... how do they reach me???
B000002KCI|5.0|ZUMA<br />Neil Young's Sgt. Pepper or Revolver.<br />Danger Bird and Cortez the Killer... Killer guitar work.<br />The album culminates with Through My Sails.<br />An intimate song... with Neil playing his Martin guitar... Russ Kunkle on congas...<br />And Crosby, Stills and Nash joining him around the fireplace in his living room, singing incredibly beautiful harmonies.<br />You can't beat that!<br />If the fireplace is an illusion, and it was actually recorded in a studio, it doesn't matter.<br />The song is so beautiful that it packs that kind of power to create that illusion.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book because I had heard so much about it.  I had a hard time getting into it.  Didn't relate to the characters and didn't like Amy at all.  I skipped through a lot of it.  It started getting better about halfway through but I guess it's just not my kind of book. I don't plan on reading another book by this author.
0385738781|5.0|Once you get into this story you're hooked. The third book changes gears once again springing a whole new set of challenges and twists on Thomas and the other characters. I loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My wife read this book and provided the review.  She could not put the book down; and waiting next book..
B00B7G23KQ|3.0|It probably is time to call it quits with the &#34;paranormal movie series&#34;, however, if you have seen them all, like me, then you have to make time for this last installment.  I liked it but my fianc&eacute; says I am whacked!  You decide!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I loved This movie I hope they make a sequel would definitely go to see.I really want to see what happens to<br />john carter and dejah thoris.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This platform archives just about anything, allows you to gather files into notebooks, have them shared and automatically updated across devices.  Have what you need accessible where you are with what you have with you.  Really makes life so much easier!
B005LIYZ52|5.0|Those familiar with Donna know her as the patient and gentle speaking teacher from her PBS series show.  This is how she comes over in her &#34;Flowers from A to Z&#34; book.  Easy to follow for beginners with tips that will interest more advanced artists, she demonstrates techniques from her many years of instruction.  You don't need to have talent to paint, it can be learned and this book will get you started.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|It stinks I can't rate things 0 stars, cuz this is worthy of that rating. You can record or take pics. U guys are like yeah, sounds good. Not really once u take pics and videos guess what! U have to BUY a new app to see anything it cost .99 but y waste your money when you can get an actual &quot;funtastic&quot; app.
B003L77G38|5.0|MAYBE I'M A DIRTY OLD MAN BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE SERIES, THE WRITING, THE ACTING, THE INCREDIBLE STORY LINES, I ALWAYS GET GREAT ENJOYMENT OUT OF JUST<br />BEHOLDING ANNA TORV'S LIPS. MANY SCREEN CRITICS HAVE LONG HELD THAT DONNA REED<br />HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LIPS IN HOLLYWOOD. WELL, WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I really enjoyed this. Great music from a band that I really like. Will be seeing them in concert this summer.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|love the writing team and balls-out raw performances by the main actors. also love the way everyone has a deeper reason for their bad actions--dynamic characters; realism at its finest.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Both extremely funny and thought provoking. I have shown this to several people who are going to purchase for their own libraries.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Exelent serries strongly recommended, fans of Hawkeye should like this to. The word requirement is a great way to get me to stop writing reviews!!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a pretty entertaining game. Sorry to say that my kids are better at it than i am though....lol. Great Fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot say enough good things about this series.  I hope it hasn't jumped the shark with the significant cast change and obvious necessity for a change in story direction.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app ! Can access the whole site...fast and all my account is there.I recommend the app for anyone with a smart phone.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a great story.  There's always something new happening.  Can't wait for the new season to start in January
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids play this game so much the battery life of their kindle fire was always on low. If i had to lose all other game apps and keep just one, It would probably be this one. Awesome app Kiloo!!!
B009HXGD4S|1.0|It was not only weird but also boring.  If I saw it in a theatre I would leave because it is a waste of time, as it is, buying it on Amazon was a waste of money.  My husband did like the photography.
0061150142|5.0|This book will be on my top 10 list for a while.  Picoult created a story with many twists and turns and as always ends it with a bang.
B00004CXMW|2.0|I'm unable to play the DVD. The rights are for the UK but did not see that anywhere on the page when the purchase was made. Now I have a DVD I can't watch and am unable to do anything with it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is addictive. I found myself playing it for hours. My kids also love it because of Chucky Cheese, that is where we played the arcade version of it. Great app.
B00BVVA138|5.0|THis album is sick. All the people crying about Howard leaving the band and Jesse coming back should stop after hearing this album. It's Killswitch at it's best and almost every song is gold. While Howard was great, Jesse will always be the original.
1476729719|5.0|Picoult has never disappointed!  This story is a topic so many are scared to discuss but she truly created a great story.  I would highly recommend this book as well as any of her others.<br /><br />I hope that this book will be chosen as her next movie :)
B00BHATWFQ|1.0|We really need to move on from this dribble about torture and women as willing or unwilling objects.  The plot thins ...
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There is great suspense and marvelous photography. . . .The actors are believable and the script is adult for a change.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Third time i have watched it.  It is possible this could happen. Mark Whalburg is always a favorite. I pick movies he is in whenever I can.
B00498YZH8|5.0|For those people that live in the Hills of MO, TN, KY and the VA's, this book is a great story of how a young girl is thrust into saving her family. Heart breaking that a young child has so much responsibility, but for the people mentioned understandable. Other viewers may believe that this would be far fetched. Great story and acting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is th best game in the world.I. love it and the graghics are awesome.You should buy Subway Suffers.I also like the themes it has the are sweet.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|We take road trips all over the US and this is a valuable tool.  We also use it while traveling overseas.  Won't leave home without it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|awesome with a little frustration but still awesome I just am addicted to this game and this game is some times annoying
B007BVMVDU|5.0|High quality tv series with great acting and impeccable set design. This is a riveting tv series that goes deep into fantasy but keeps it palatable and grounded.
1571200851|3.0|It would be fun for a small project but it's too time consuming for a large one.  I like the designs and maybe at some future time I'll be more into this tedious process.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|anyone who is a fan of tommy should own this.  i love it and usually listen to it at least once a day.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I like &#34;Winter World&#34; better than &#34;Fall of the Giants.&#34;  Fall of the Giants spent too much time on the actual battles of World War I and also the Russian revolution.  I enjoy the historical part, but some of what was going on in Russia and on the battlefield got to be a little too much for me.  I have not finished &#34;Winter World.&#34;
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is full of suspense and fantasy and mystery. If you look either one of those three, but this book. I could not put this book down, I always wondered what would happen next. This also a non~predictable book. I strongly suggest getting it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The author does such a wonderful job of accurately depicting and portraying the dynamics of a world of domestic violence within the context of relationship with a delusional sadistic sociopath that I would STRONGLY caution those who have personal experience with domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or abuse of any kind to consider where they are in their own healing before reading, as this book has the potential to be a dangerous and devastating trigger.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|I've always liked mythology and I really enjoyed immersing myself in a world of myth right smack in our time. As usual, Rick Riordan tells a captivating tale. Fast paced, winding and original, the story of the Kanes  and the Egyptian deities is a must read for any age.
B008VBYN80|4.0|My opinion is so far so good.. most games get downloaded and after like 5 minutes I end up deleting most of the games.. I like the way that u level up quickly in this game.. so for now I'll keep it..
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This was one of my mum's favs back in the early 70's and I can remember watching it with her when I was a kid. Loved it then simply as a vampire movie. Still one of my favs. I was rapt when I found this. Great classic movie!
B000059H98|5.0|Chances are if you have found this dvd, you know what it is. This is a great movie based on the Tank Girl comic books.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|I always wanted an HP calculator.  Some of my friends swear by them.  I always wanted to learn how RPN worked.  This was a GREAT deal for a very small price.  I remember when these first came out back when I was in college.  I couldn't afford one back then but I can now.  This is a great app on my Kindle.  Have not encountered any problems with it.  Works just like the real thing.  Great for the brain cells as I need to think differently on how to use it and properly enter the parameters.  I'm very satisfied with it and would recommend this.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is truly amazing. I seriously could not put it down. My parents were beginning to be angry at me because I would not put my kindle down. Every of my spare seconds were spent reading. Yann Martel has written a beautiful story about a boy named PI and his castaway frienemy Richard Parker. I highly recommend that you purchase this book!!!!!! Also, I suggest that you buy the movie too!!! I watched it 4 times with in the first 2 and 1/2 weeks of buying it. As you may now it received an  Oscar for best graphics. And I have to agree with them. I remember replaying it twice in one night. Anyway, I'm going to end the review now so I can read LIFE of PI again=) it has become my favorite book entirely and I hope that this review helps you and persuades you into buying this book because it is AMAZING=D and by the way, if you don't think that you can make it through the beginning keep going because if you stop you won't be able to witness the greatest book in history=D thanks for you time and remember to buy the book and the movie=) also thanks to Yann Martel for writing such a great story:D HAPPY READING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like temple run because there is lots of opsitals.I also like temple run because you have to think to win.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I am a Denzel Washington fan and this movie didn't disappoint.  I'd rather expected it to be a fictionalized version of the plane that was successfully landed in the Hudson, but was completely wrong on that score.  Good movie, great acting, and an unexpected storyline made for an interesting couple of hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is just fantastic. i totally recommend this if youre bored or just want something fun to do. :)
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A clear guide to become a better human being and to become clear of the ego..easy read,direct- doable..recommended for anyone wanting a better life,a better world.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|My whole family loves this movie!  From my 21 year old son to my 5 year old daughter.  Great flick.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Enjoyed rereading this adventure tale of a young boy in search of a mysterious treasure hidden in the Carribean.  Long John Silver is a fascinating character from beginning to end.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I received the DVD in the mail a few days ago. I haven't watched it yet, but I've seen the Passion of The Christ before, many times. Love the movie. One of my favorites ever. The fact that this DVD has loaded with extras makes it 1,000 times better to me. I LOVE to see how people make movies. Yes, I'm one of those people. Can't wait to watch. Highly excited!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is like my favorite game I hope everyone likes it if they don't I will be pretty pretty sad so please like it rate it 5 star for me a girl that live this game so rate it it's my favorite so it should be it fav game on this cause again it's my favorite game on my divice
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My whole family loves watching this movie in either 3D or Blu Ray depending on the mood.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast moving and mysterious plot line throughout.  Surprise ending. Another very good read from David Baldacci.  Highly recommended novel in his series of books.
0811729117|5.0|As has been stated before, the translation initially seems clumsy, but the calibre of the soldier authoring the work quickly shines through. Brutal stories are told but the work is not particularly brutal or gory  and it does not descend into simply being an action story of who fired when, etc. Some readers may find that understatement disappointing, but over time the enormity of the man's experience produces a deep respect on it's own, and it forces your imagination into work mode to understand what the situation would really have been like. An excellent exposition of the tragic command failures by both sides, and a fresh viewpoint on the war that does not cross the line into bitter nationalism.<br /><br />Helps if you're a tank fan (and obviously a history nerd) but hardly necessary to appreciate it from a historical, military, or personal standpoint. Highly recommended.

B005LAIGN2|4.0|Put B-24's and other fighters in it would have made it a lot better movie. Not sure on that attacking of a German base at that time with P-40's especially if Germans knew you were coming. That was more dangerous than air combat what I had heard.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|This was a gift for my mom, she loved it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The story and perspective is interesting and the acting is great.  The whole movie is very well done.  I enjoyed the historical perspective of the events.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Have not seen the movie yet but will now.  Anything N Sparks writes is great for me.  Held my interest all the way through.
B001AUKUTU|5.0|All excellent, It is recommended to try this album. The ítem arrived in time and the description was exactly as the web.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Holy cow! I am a new comer to The walking dead series... a friend let me borrow the 1st season and 2nd... I watched this season as it came out and I have never been as Sold on a TV series as this one - I loved this season so much more as the drama was kept minimal and the twists and turns were fresh and unexpected - 3rd season was The best yet so far especially the first few episodes - If your any fan of zombies or thrillers, itd be worth your time to experience this -<br />-Frank (Hemet CA)
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This movie was poorly marketed by Disney and failed at the box office. That is really unfortunate because it is a great adventure, really well made and should have spawned a whole series of sequels. It is a real sleeper of a Sci-Fi classic and not to be missed if you like this genre.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I really only downloaded it because another game used it as a requirement for a challenge. It never downloaded correctly though. Just a black screen.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very interesting and even compelling book. Read while doing research for a paper on NDE for my Science and Religion upper level class.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good movie - intense - it was a good rainy day video to watch at home.  I just wonder how far from the truth it strayed.  The CIA agent who was the central character seemed to be a bit overplayed.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much! I recommended it to my son and daughter as 'must read'.  I have been talking about this book to my friends.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not real Facebook, but better than Facebook mobile. I can't seem to look up people that aren't already on my friends list, haven't figured out how to make new pages, and my for sale sites only show so many posts then I can't access the rest.
B009AMANBA|1.0|If I could have chosen 1/2 star, I would have.  I have never written a review before, but I hated this movie so much that I felt I needed to prevent others from wasting 2 1/2 hours of their lives.  Go get a root canal instead or maybe go watch your grass grow.  Either one would be more entertaining than this movie.
B001NYTUXU|5.0|I loved this album all off the songs are great it is totally worth it paying $9.00 for it! I loved it!
140131046X|5.0|\\"Have a Little Faith\\" is an up-lifting little book that is a very easy read and yet interesting enough to keep the reader with it.  It is about the lives of two very different men from completely different worlds, yet bound by their incredible faith.  This book is a true story, which always makes it more captivating to me.  I was somewhat hesitant to read it, as I have not found all of Mitch Albom's books to be at the top of my list, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and do recommend it to others.

0446554995|5.0|this is a great Pendergast story that is very difficult to put down, and you just don't want the book to end. I have read all of this series, I think: I think this is one of the best ones they have written!!!
030795062X|5.0|This is my second time reading \\"Norwegian Wood\\" but only now do I feel like I \\"get\\" it.  I have read many Murakami novels and he is my favorite living novelist.  My first Murakami novel was \\"The Windup Bird Chronicle\\" and it took me places I'd never been with literature.  I found myself plunging into the deep well of the novel but also into that of my psyche. It helped that I was in a fragile state, living through months of unemployment, uncertain what came next.  There is a well in \\"Norwegian Wood\\" but not with the same power.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\" doesn't have the magical realism of \\"Windup\\" or of his later or earlier books.  And when I first read it, I tossed the book aside as minor because of this missing element.<br /><br />Now preparing for a book club discussion, I have a different take.  One thing has changed between readings - my parents have died - and so the grief of the book hits me deeper.  Having gone through my own grief, I'm able to take in a key line of the book with greater appreciation: \\"Death is not the opposite of life but an innate part of life.\\" That isn't a sentence I would have understood before experiencing the death of my parents.  Before they died, their death seemed like the edge of a cliff, the end of the world.  Only when I sat with them in their dying did I understand what life there is in that act.<br /><br />Toru sits with Midori's father in the last days of his life.  He watches the dying man eat a cucumber like his life depended upon and maybe it did.  But he still died.  It didn't prevent death as how could it?  The dead in this book are key parts of this story.  When the book opens, many of them are already dead and their lives and deaths hover over everything that happens.  There is Kizuki, Naoko and Midori's father. But death is intrinsic to life.  It is the fire clearing away the underbrush allowing for new growth.<br /><br />And death is how Toru grows up.  With his only friend and his friend's life long girlfriend Naoko, Toru is a stunted creature only able to move on with his life with their death. Toru has to look elsewhere to find real love with someone who actually pays attention to who he is and cares about him as an individual.  Something we never get from Naoko or Kizuki.<br /><br />I puzzled over the backdrop of the student agitation in the late sixties Japan.  It feels unrelated to the real story of the book, dismissed by Toru as juvenile and unremarked upon by any of the other major characters. Why include it then?  Historical facts can act as lightening rods attracting all the attention particularly if they don't matter to the story.  I think those events help authenticate Toru's struggle.  He has no time for the politics, finding those engaged in the activities just as immature as he but pursuing an avenue that won't help them grow.  Toru, by staying true to himself and what he feels, is not turning away from the difficult or uncomfortable and is able to mature.<br /><br />I'm so glad I reread \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"  I have a new and different appreciation for Murakami and breadth of his writing talents.s a stunted creature only able to move on with his life with their death.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Only the BBC and Great Britain could produce such a film on retired musical artists, mostly musicians and opera singers. They are not guaranteed a long, slow and inactive aging period leading to their eventual dismissal but they are expected to go on practicing their arts, singing and playing, together if possible? and performing a few times a year to remain active and hence not simply survive but still create, produce, and enrich their collective lot, not out of pity or from charity from the public but because they provide that public with all kinds of real services, classes, lectures, concerts, etc.<br /><br />This film is exceptional since the average age of the actors is 178 or is it 198 years, so says one of them, but they are escaping depression and self-abandonment because they perform together for themselves and for a public that they invite, that come to learn from them. That film is a beautiful gospel of hope for the aging population in our countries. They must not be dependent, even and especially on the state, but they must keep the control of their life and their economic resources. A man can only be a man if he produces added value and that does not stop when you retire. Retiring is a humane solution for those who don't have their physical and mental health or enough of these physical and mental means to still be able to create, to teach, to bring something to other people, younger people or not so young people. In international humanitarian NGOs one can volunteer up to the age of NINETY-NINE years.<br /><br />So this film, produced and directed by the aging Dustin Hoffman (he is seventy-five years old, since he was a child of the New Deal), is the proof that life and the show must go on, no matter what. The film is full of empathy, humor, living power and force, constant and permanent energy: what am I going to do today? Of course I am going to play some music, do some singing, read a book, but also meet the others here and do these things with them, with passion, with emotion, with sympathy and at times compassion. I will share my emotions and passions with the others who will share their passions and emotions with me. I may take a walk and sit in the garden, go down town and enjoy looking at the cars going by, the children getting out of school, the salespeople in the stores where I will buy a trinket or a ballpoint pen just to be able to speak to the salesperson there. I may flirt or simply be nice and friendly with the unknown people I meet at the bus stop or in the streetcar, on the train, or anywhere indeed. Most of them will either shrug me off silently or just answer nicely: I have the age that brings respect and even help if I need some, and a few words often are all the help I need.<br /><br />People around me are just like elephants in the jungle. If I don't block the way, they may go by without noticing me, or smile at me for no reason whatsoever except that I am old enough to be smiled at, or even provided with a few words and a hand to hold a door, to help me up or down some stairs.<br /><br />This film is just showing this macrocosmic reality of aging in a society that does not seem to age at all, along with the microcosmic reality of everyday tensions, emotions, feelings, happiness or satisfaction. And the film shows how you must not overdo it. That's when you really get senile: you don't see others at all and you escape into an invisible reality that is only material in your mind, or you invade the people around you with your own sentiments, feelings and obsessions without seeing that it is not an exchange but a drone from your mind onto the people around you.<br /><br />And when that balance is kept, between these two extremes, you can have some very pleasant moments of real sharing that will enlighten your life, and their life, till the end of the trip. Yes indeed the objective is to get married again with the people of your generation, and also with people from younger generations, and marriage is sharing and doing together. That's what marriage for all means for me.<br /><br />A very sensitive and endearing film about an essential stake of the present and the coming decades.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUge is sharing and doing together. That's what marriage for all means for me.<br /><br />A very sensitive and endearing film about an essential stake of the present and the coming decades.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B000FBJFSC|1.0|Probably the most depressing book I've ever read.  Made me want to deny I have Irish ancestors. Wished I had never read it.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|This is a great song from the tv show and we liked it so much that we had to have it. Kids sing along it the car to it.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|Forman does it again! This book was incredibly well written and engaging. It was hard to put down! I enjoyed following Adam and Mia's lives once more. Forman did a spectacular job of combining the past with the present as you follow the characters. I am eager to read more of Forman's work!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|There are few other shows that depict a powerful woman balancijng it all.  Highly recommended. The plots are very interesting.  Don't miss an episode.
B0000019PA|5.0|Since the first time I listened to this album, it has been one of my absolute favorites. It may not change your life, but it will open your eyes. Everyone should listen to this album. Everyone.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|The acting is brilliant.  The plot twists are scintillating.  It's suspenseful and riveting. And, the suspense is interwoven with comedic action that will tickle the funny-bone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The end of the trilogy!! I'm not a reader by any means but once I started the Fifty Shades, I couldn't put it down!!!! E L James did an amazing job in these 3 books. Please bring us more Fifty Shades of Gray
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Some people are driven to climb mountains and others live to surf them.  Great blend of big waves and a compelling story line makes this film one you just may want to watch more than once.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|This is an excellent film for all ages, a story about an extra-terrestrial accidently left behind when a space ship has to hastily leave to avoid humans. A young boy finds E.T., and after the initial shock takes him into the home, and introduces him to his brother and sister. E.T. learns rudimentary English, but eventually wants to return home. Watching the family and a TV movie, E.T. figures out that he needs to call home, and constructs a device to do so. While waiting, however, he dies, then somehow comes back to life. And on to a wonderful ending.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|It's a great story, no doubt about it.  However, being based on a real story, it doesn't have a happy ending, anymore than the person the story is about did.  Beautiful scenery, and unlikely characters that are likable all make this a great movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Vince Flynn wrote another masterpiece.  Too bad he isn't really working for the CIA!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I never thought I’d read such a page-turner about IT operations. I was enormously influenced by Jez Humble and David Farley’s Continuous Delivery, and The Phoenix Project gave me a lot of new avenues to explore in this revolution underway in business and IT. Nice work, gentlemen.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|First off I should let you know I'm a grown adult. Granted a bit of a romantic though.  It was well written book with a different twist on the why werewolves change and for how long.  Definitely worth reading and I would recommend it to be men and women.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I had never seen or read any of the TinTin tales before, and from the commercials I had half seen, I assumed the name  referred to the dog. So, I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  I was also amazed at the animation.  There is something called the uncanny divide, where animation that approaches reality is better, until at a certain point it is so close to life-like, without being life-like, that it looks all wrong.  This is the first animation I've seen that challenges you to tell if it's animation or not, and doesn't look all wrong.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|My book club read this book and everyone loved it.  The story is compelling and the description of flowers was beautiful.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|highly recommend this entire CD (and screw the non-explicit version, this version is the bomb), every song is a win.  Great for dancing from hip hop to salsa to samba to swing.  Love it!  Pitbull is rapidly turning into my favorite artist.
B00821OX98|4.0|I am,not usually into sci-fi but my husband and Iove this show. Hope it keeps on for years to come.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was good but it was not nearly as good as the first book. It had a great deal of too many slow parts for my taste, but I was able to finish it and will be purchasing the third and final book. What I really enjoy about this trilogy is all the psychological underlying aspects of each character. I am so enthralled by Grey's character and how his Ana is able to provide him with therapy and Grey in return to her.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Uso questo programma dal cellulare e dal tablet per collegarmi al PC di casa da WiFi,è molto utile come averlo sempre con se.

B00BF123WG|4.0|Unless you are into &#34;government&#34; and movies regarding international politics this may not be for you.  An excellent portrayal of all characters leads you up to the ultimate prize of UBL's demise.  I personally thought the story and plot were fantastic.  Zero Dark Thirty captured many moments and incidences that much of the public are unaware of.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So easy to use on the Kindle Fire.<br />Once you start, you just can't stop! Exercises, fashion, recipes, crafts, home diy, you name, it's on Pinterest. See what your friends are pinning!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Finally an action-comedy with older and younger actors and I don't cringe all the time from foul language.  I think all the actors worked very well together.  My favorite is Marvin.  It's funny how he thinks of killing as just a &#34;job&#34;.  &#34;Wanna get some pancakes?&#34;
B007BVOEPI|5.0|As true to the book as it could be given the limited amount of time they had. Top quality actors and a very well adapte script. Can't wait for season two!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved it, great movie,  if you have kids it may be a little too violent for them.... But who am I kidding... Their video games are 10X violent
B001P5HI4A|5.0|A very wonderful story told with a sense of humor, as only Barbra could do.  I love the song &#34;PAPA&#34;.
B004LWZW42|5.0|As the others have said the relationship between Charles and Erik is worth the admission price alone.  The scene with them training at the compound in front of the Satellite dish is for me right on par with the ending of the Dark Knight in terms of emotion, energy, score, everything.  Can't wait for the next one.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play. Love it! One thing that does get annoying, is that sometimes it lags when you play for a while. Other than that the game is super fun and I love playing it.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie.1920s country folk standin up  for principals that should be in force in today's world. Would be a better place if more people acted this way again, I think anyways.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|The watch is nice. Not too heavy and too light. The dial is clear and looks like a watch that costs a lot more. The problem I have with it is with its clasp. It closes very tight and it is very hard to open when you want to take off the watch. Unless you have long nails, this thing is really hard to disband and take off!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever! They game is so graphic and colorful. My favorite characters are Lucy, Fresh, and Frizzy.It is just like temple run, but better. And they are currently on a world tour so right now they are in Sydney.The best thing about it is the mystery boxes. You can find coins and all types of other stuff in there.But my favorite power up is the jetpack. They also have this new thing on the update, you can pick up blue keys and they are called save me. If you die u can use a save me and continue your game. SUBWAY SURFERS IS SO FUN, AND IT  IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO PAST THE TIME AND IF YOUR BORED THE BEST THING TO DO IS PLAY SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Felt like I was on the most emotional roller-coaster ever & I didn't want to get off.<br />I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end.<br />These 2 were exhausting & at times I wanted to close the screen & go to be but I couldn't...so frustrating I had to know what was going to happen next.<br />I loved how cRaZy in love with her he was.<br />This book had friendship, truth, love, passion, drama, heartache, happiness, laughter & awe.<br />Was almost sad when it ended but was good enough closure for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is like thee best heaven ever. It is so adiccting to play. GET IT, THIS GAME I FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Great buying experience always. Halestorm rocks!<br />Sound quality is awesome. I will always use Amazon for my music downloads. Buy it people!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was intrigued the whole time!!!!!!! Could not put it down when I originally read it. I'm now onto the next book \\"Walking Disaster\\" in which I waited patiently for it to come out!!!! Who doesn't want a Travis Maddox in their life lol
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Absolutely love this game. I bought it yesterday and can't stop playing it. The colors are vibrant and the music is relaxing. If I could rate it 10 stars I would!! Even my 8 year old loves it!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|So informative. ! but so personally<br />engaging<br />A must for anyone wanting or needing to know what wit is like too lose memory of self and  the world
0385344228|1.0|I fell for the four star best seller hype and found a very boring, poorly written, and predictable anti-thriller. I am really confused as to how this author has been praised to such a degree for writing a poorly plotted book with absolutely no character development.  In fact, I couldn't find one reason to care about any of these characters as they each betrayed themselves and are horribly dull and annoying. Will be confused how this guy is doing so well in the publishing world for a long time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|There is something about this book that just makes you feel relaxed. It makes you think about your life in a good way. It makes you feel infinite. It's makes you think about how special everyone is in their own way and how we are all blessed to have our own kind of family and our own kind of friends. We are infinite
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game has a very appealing mix of old arcade feel with more modern features (power ups, 3-d perspectives). It's quick to get into and fun to keep on going!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great for the Dr. Who lovers! Kids love it, nice little toy. Works as well as described - will buy again!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I used to buy and listen to albums and think about what it took to create them. That was years ago....... Some Nights brings back life and wonder.  This is a defining work, it does not matter what they do beyond this, as they created a milestone for themselves and for us. I will always remember Some Nights, the album and those moments of my life.  Thanks FUN !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would throw myself off a plane 350,124,985,164 feet in the air to complete the daily challenge on time! (Joking) I love how you can change characters in subway surfers.check out hatfullofraisins on YouTube if you want a laughing party!:)
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Level 3-3 of \\"Trick or Treat\\" is impossible to get three stars in, even after consulting online tutorials. After almost 7 months of frustration I actually made paper firing angle templates from the tutorials but was still unable to obtain three stars in the level. Several other levels are impossible to obtain three stars in without consulting the online tutorials. However, other levels are so easy that they can be mastered in one try. Some Golden Eggs require clever thinking while others will never be found without looking on the Internet for tips or walkthroughs. Adds interfere with game play. A very poor and frustrating rendition of the game and a waste of time due to the impossible nature of the requirements needed to pass the levels. Not even worth downloading for free.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Awesome adventure of the mind. Could relate to the hunger for knowledge that Kvothe has. Loved the descriptive writing, especially the ideas on being a musician and its almost supernatural transcendence of your being because of the music. Loved it!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is so amazing that it makes it easy for us gamers to commit crimes. GAME IS simply beautiful. Humans are eatable to the bones.Sharks are jumping in slomo. SUPERB JUST GET THE GAME.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers but I do feel that some of the characters like the limited edition ones such as Carmen, Roberto, and Kim, without buying any coins. But I really like your new key idea! I like how I can get them in mystery boxes too.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this when out of town for myself or my daughter. She loves it too.<br />Great assortment of sounds love the way you can layer them too.
B0091REZMW|3.0|At first the assistant keeps giving you instructions and it gets annoying. The outfit she is warring is too suductive. The good thing is at first they give you 65 diamonds but if you do not use they wisely they will blow away quickly. For this game you need a great deal of paitients and lack of frustration. It is a good games but there is a great room for improvement.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Woven together the past and present in such eloquence that one is transported directly into the world's of these women.  Beautifully written with just the right language and words to transport the reader directly into the lives of each of these women.

0316228532|2.0|The question isn't how well, but why. If Rowling was trying to drum up support for her charities, you'd think there'd be somebody in the 500+ pages who isn't repulsive. Doesn't she know any nice people? Are these numerous characters a new version of Dementors? Frankly, I only finished it so I could have the pleasure of saying how worthless I found it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing.its fun and easy.and if you are on the go you can always play this game.to me the world tours are the best .you  can go to new York,Rio,Rome,and hopefully many more are on the way.you will be happy you bought this.

0547564651|4.0|Paul Tough's main point is that grit, curiosity, and character are as important--maybe more important--to a person's success in life as are intelligence and aptitude at taking tests. Intelligence is important, but the determination and stamina to develop that intelligence is more important. That makes sense.<br /><br />I kept putting off reading this book even though I'm interested in this subject and felt the book would be important. I was afraid it would be overflowing with the most recent scientific studies by psychologists and sociologists looking, from numerous angles, at the education problem in the United States. It was. I grow weary of all the research studies sited in books like this. Sometimes it's like the story Seven Blind Mice by Ed Young. Six blind mice go out independently to determine what a new Something near their pond is. Each discovers a different part of the Something and returns with a vastly different description. The seventh mouse explores the whole and figures out the Something is an elephant. I'm not saying the research studies aren't important, it's just that it's dangerous to loose site of the big picture. Frequently when we look at the big picture, common sense provides an answer. Unfortunately, because common sense isn't scientific, it is often rejected by the scientific establishment. Paul Tough is trying to play the role of the seventh mouse, and he does it fairly well.<br /><br />Tough also states that research (here we go again), in the form of opinion polls, indicates a considerable majority of Americans want the government to do something about the education problem. He seems to agree with that sentiment. Yet he explains that over the last six decades the government's war on poverty, which goes hand in hand with the education crisis, has been expensive and ineffective. The percent of the population living in poverty has gone up slightly despite all the money and effort the government has thrown at it. Why do we love the idea of our government being the solution to all our problems?

B00ABO573A|4.0|An interesting study of the complexities of relationships. Two different lives trying and failing to make it all work. A little slow but worth the watching.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I ordered and read when I found out our school might have this required for 6th grade reading.  Really awesome in my opinion and recommend for 5th too and any grade/age.  I think it keeps the perspectives real from the different characters whose head you get inside too.  Wonderful quotable lines later in the book about Kindness, Friendship, Courage and Character...and Greatness in the 'Awards' chapter.  A great read

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is super awesome.  Read the others in the series.  Some of them are just as good as some are even better.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|This is a well written book which helps make up for the whole series of less plausible things that go on in the book.<br /><br />I read it years ago after purchasing it in ebook format on the publishers website. It is now available as a free Kindle download. I just re-read it.<br /><br />I find the science part of it tedious sometimes, and find myself skipping a paragraph or two now and then. It is SF after all and there has to be some science or at least pseudo science in it to satisfy the genre, but the descriptions of it occasionally get a little long winded for my taste.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty good, if also somewhat far fetched. The good guys are way too good to be true, and the bad guys are caricatures rather than real characters.<br /><br />I never really believed a lot of stuff that goes on in the story, or the series as a whole was possible, but it is good enough for me to enjoy anyway.<br /><br />Having said all that, I liked the series enough to purchase all of the books (except maybe the last one). YMMV.

B00B8PMWJI|1.0|Usually I keep my opinion to myself; everything's a matter of taste, right?  Maybe so, but I was shocked--SHOCKED--by this this film's complete failure as entertainment.  These are supposed to be 26 of the hottest, sharpest, most ingenious directors on the horror scene and all the lot of them could come up with in this remarkable concept was a great big rasher of silly, pompous, uninteresting, boring, unengaging porridge.  This is the first time I've been so disappointed by a movie that I've felt compelled to write a negative review.  You've<br />GOT to be kidding me!
B004GYY714|5.0|I downloaded this app pending an arrival of a storm, and anticipating a poweer outage. This app does everything it claims to and more. It's just like having an old school analog radio.

B00979CS50|5.0|Neil and the Horse have been working on their sound for decades.  This is about as good as it gets, right up there with Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I can't wait for the house of hades this series is perfect like a harry potter meets Greek mythology hybrid.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am committed to this classic.  Hook, line and sinker.  Husband and I feel this is one of the best stories we have EVER seen. Can't wait for season 4 to start.  Well done and a joy to watch without having to wait week to week. Will probably buy the full set in time.
B00006879E|3.0|A couple of cuts that I like, but I've heard better from this group.  I'm open to suggestions for other albums.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Edgy...beautiful...well produced and nothing like her earlier albums.  I love them all but this one kills me.  I'm very happy Norah has avoided becoming the next pop sensation.  One day her work will be honored as some of the best in modern jazz/rock.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|I was enjoying this game on my Kindle Fire until I hit a scene that had a hidden object right under the return button. Kept going back to the main menu of the game. It also restarted twice and one time did not save a puzzle I had just completed.It was a bummer because I was enjoying it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is EPIC! It is very easy and kids of all ages could play. It's a very similar game to temple run but it is with trains!! I love this game so much!
0062080237|1.0|By the end of the first chapter I was really enjoying this book (that's about 25 pages in).  Great prose, interesting situation and concept, a bit of a mystery, an adult take on the fantasy world.  Good elements.  The character was passive, and Gaiman explicitly points this out at one point, writing about how Shadow felt he was being thrown about with no say of his own, but I can take some passiveness.  I think there's a way to write passive characters to make them more interesting, but Gaiman did not succeed at that, here.<br /><br />This story lacks conflict.  Granted, there's a lot of talk about conflict, the coming storm, the war between the old and new gods, but nothing really materializes, and there's virtually no conflict leading up to that anti-climactic ending.  There's nothing carrying me towards that.  Shadow has no motivation.  Any problem he finds himself in (which appear at random without any buildup) are quickly and easily dissolved.  Really, there's no reason for him to even be a part of this, it seems.<br /><br />I'm not the kind of person who feels novels necessarily need a plot, but they need something to move the story along--an emotional arc, something.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Great voice from one of rock's most understated stars.  I don't care what Boz Scaggs sings, it all sounds great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game my whole family plays it we are a subway surfer family.I have almost unlocked every one so has my mom it is one of the best games I have played.<br />  Thanks people of subway surfer it is awesome<br />  Love B.Williams
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Love the music. Glad that the show is doing well. This music isn't something you might hear on the radio, which is a shame, because this is really foot tapping, or soul crushing music.
0679746323|5.0|This is a great book tolearn the background of the Chinese cultuure and the continued struggle of the Chinese people. Thanks!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Horrible. Should never have been made. Like it was written by 12 year boys though that's not really fair to 12 year old boys.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was a devouted 50 Shades fan. Then a friend suggested the Crossfire trilogy. Almost 20 readings of Bared to You and Reflected in You, I am a converter. And I don't see the continued reading ending anytime soon. Well, not until Entwined arrives. The vulnerability of this man completely consumes me. His broken heart, lost soul makes him so beautiful. Certain parts are written so breathtakingly, that I just read them over and over smiling or crying at what a treasure this man is. At the end of book 2 and the cop is explainIng to Eva the sequence of events in the gym. Oh my God, what he did for her. He kept telling her \\" just wait\\" he'll always take care of her. I hope they marry in book 3.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I had seen the PBS special with Bocelli in Portofino, Italy and was absolutely transported by the music, the scenery, the whole scene.  And the music on this CD is outstanding!  Evey time I listen to it I see the whole show again!<br />Jean
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Excellent article! I recommend it to all 100%. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|A real, surprisingly thoughtful book about the journey of a young man struggling with common life.  Relatable.  I was moved by incredible moments of bloody honesty.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is awesome; cool; fun;terrific ;and what ever you can think or dream its fun
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Typical Brown effort...weaves an interesting story while also educating us about ancient words and thoughts.  This one offers a lot of insights into the Masonic influences on our country's founders.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I don't understand what is going on with this product--my e-mails from today ended in the trash folder. Now I have to go back to & check my Kindle to see if something has changed on my import page (which I haven't done). Last week I couldn't retrieve them on my Kindle Fire (has since been resolved). Have been having trouble forwarding e-mails & sending new ones. I am seriously considering changing my e-mail provider. Some help please!!<br />bankernana@yahoo.com
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is a classic that should be on your reading list. I love the time period and the relationships among the sisters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a Walking Dead addict. It's the best series ever. Like a soap opera, they leave you wanting more at the end of every episode.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's so nice to be able to carry my bible in my pocket. It's quick and easy to use. I love or.
