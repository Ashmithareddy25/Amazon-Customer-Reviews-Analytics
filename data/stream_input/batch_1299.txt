0439023483|5.0|I read the Hunger Games before it was announced as a movie. I honestly thought I would hate it, because I don't like blood and gore in books. But when I started this book, it fascinated me. I was very into reading utopian society novels, and the Hunger Games is dystopian. I started it late into the afternoon, and I read it in two hours. I couldn't put it down, and I skipped all the work I had to do that night. I was so intrigued by the storyline, of sending children to kill each other. I bought Catching Fire and Mockingjay the next day, and loved them as much as the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is the only book I've read that is so amazing that even today I can't stop thinking about it. Everyday some little thing triggers a memory of the Hunger Games, and I recommended it to everyone in my family and all of my friends, too. I would very strongly recommend anyone to read this book, but because of some gruesome scenes, I do admit that I think the book is geared more towards young adults/adults. You will not be disappointed with the Hunger Games, and everyone I know that has read the book loved it. I can't wait until the movie premieres on March 23, 2012, and if you're thinking of seeing the movie, read the book first! It's a good, fast read and is the most amazing book I've ever read in my life! I hope this review was helpful!
B000002J0N|5.0|Crosby, Stills & Nash / CSN:  This is a collection of songs more than a coherent album but those songs are mostly excellent.  \\"Cathedral\\" is an excellent song but is a disturbing reminder to stay away from LSD (Nash has stated that he wrote this song after a particularly strange acid trip on his 32nd birthday).  This album does have an indefinable uneasiness to it (compared to their other albums) and perhaps such personal risk-taking is the reason for it, but this is nevertheless a Five Star release.
B006C1DH92|3.0|I like this app a lot. it does what the thing says its supposed to do. I only wish there were more blades and backgrounds to unlock. do yourself a favor, buy the original fruit ninja.  I wish I. could find the achievements!!!! ive unlocked everything, so I want to find something else to.do in the game.
B00005LANG|5.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers / Exodus - Movement of Jah People:  This is Bob's most accessible and universal album because his writing is less Rastafarian, the performances are magnificent, and the production is the best he had ever been given.  This is a Masterpiece album and it deserves a Sixth Star.  P.S., King Haile Selassie is dead and in his grave, get over it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|i loved this book and i hated it. i love the hunger games but mockingjay was so sad. i hated that suzanne collins spent time building up amazing characters such as prim and finnick and then killed them all off. i spent the last fifty pages crying especially when prim died and katniss cried with poor buttercup. i am crying right now just thinking about it. it also broke my heart that collins just sent gale off to district 2 in the end. it was like she spent mockingjay trying to turn him into a bad guy. overall if youre one of those people like me who get extremley attached to certain characters, id advise you not to read this book.
B000002KCV|5.0|Neil Young / Comes A Time: This isn't \\"Harvest\\" but it comes close.  This is a terrific laid-back country Neil album.  It's a Gem.  Five Stars
1434475662|3.0|This was required reading for my English class, and I wasn't thrilled with the story line, as it's all about finding one's self and innerbeing, however that is nothing the seller can control so if like me you have this for required reading you should note that:<br />A: it came in great condition<br />B: and it was one of the most inexpensive copy available when I ordered
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Al Stewart / Time Passages:  After the mega success of his weakest album in years (Year of the Cat), Al returns with this brilliant album.  Returning to his excellent story telling folk traditions, this is an endlessly fascinating album.  Five Stars
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good if u r bored because games are weird but idk its ok 20 word the cat was dog fat fun
B000002G8H|5.0|Eric Clapton / Slowhand (1996 version CD): This is not screaming Rock N Roll, it was never meant to be. This is a Great, restrained, Country/Blues album.  It is a very fine album.  Five Stars.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I purchased a used DVD set, The Pacific, and was very pleased with the speed of shipping and also the condition of the movies. Before this buy I was a little apprehensive of the \\"used\\" items on Amazon but now I'm looking forward to other purchases that can help cut my costs... great for folks on a budget like me!!
B000002GB9|4.0|STYX / The Grand Illusion:  STYX was a very good radio friendly band that made a couple of individual albums that are preferable over any `hits' package.  This album is one of those worth owning.  The Grand Illusion has it's share of radio hits, but it works very well as an album.  Four Stars (4 ½)
B00008CLIP|4.0|A pretty good lineup of artists and a couple songs you don't hear everyday.  I keep this one in the car for long trips and it seems to make them go by faster.
B000002GBB|4.0|STYX / Pieces of Eight:  This is the other Styx album (along with Grand Illusion) that is better than having a `hits' package.  I've never been a huge Styx fan but these two albums have more going for them then just a few hits, they have a certain continuity that enhances their hits when heard in the context of the album.  Still, this is no `masterpiece' but its a very good album.  Four Stars
B005HV6Y84|5.0|One of the best movie soundtracks I've heard in a long time...I can't listen to it enough!  Music is beautiful and fun and the artist have incredible talent!  You will love it!  Thanks so much!!!
B000JLQSW4|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project / I Robot: Loosely based on the book, I Robot is a terrific album.  It has a dated `70's' sound to it, but not so dated as to be a distraction.  This one is not as seamlessly produced as their \\"Mystery...Poe\\" album, but in many ways this one is more enjoyable (I recommend both albums).  The bonus tracks are good and don't get in the way of the concept of the album.<br />  Five Stars.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I would encourage all of you frustrated with Superman75's obnoxious and disrespectful comments, to E-mail customer service.  I am reading this at 10 a.m. EST and wondering how any of his story could be true...  This is a child's app, as stated, and should be reviewed accordingly.  Personally, I think this app works well for what it is meant for.
B000002GW5|5.0|Jackson Browne / Running On Empty:  While Browne was dealing with the sorrow of his wife's suicide during the making of \\"The Pretender\\", here (in \\"Running On Empty\\") he seems to be both running away from that sorrow and searching for a new paradigm in which to live the rest of his life.  It is no coincidence that his later albums became more overtly political as that became the new grid by which he saw the world.  Here we have the lost and wandering Browne, who even gets help with the writing of his songs, and using other folks songs as well.  The result however, sees no loss of quality or production.  This is another excellent album from Browne.  One other note, the next time you watch the movie Forrest Gump and hear the song \\"Running on Empty\\" while Forrest is dealing with his loss by running from shore to shore, know that it's not that different than what Browne himself was doing when he wrote it (except Browne used a tour bus).<br /> Five Stars.
0060873027|2.0|Three-quarters of the way through this book, a character slaps another character, who is slipping in and out of consciousness, across the face and yells, verbatim, \\"Don't you dare die on me!\\" followed eventually by a brief makeout session as the character regains consciousness later.  I feel as though this book was completely written with a movie in mind, and I would love to know at what point Preston took over for Crichton (I have my theories).   This book is action-cliche and overall disappointing. If you need something to get you by on a long plane trip, this might do it, but if you're looking for something that leaves a real impression, look elsewhere.
B00026WUAU|5.0|Bob Dylan / Street Legal:  This album sounds more like a sermon than his Christian albums do, like someone surveying his position and setting his boundaries in a public statement.  This album IS `street legal' and it's a highly polished mover.  Five Stars
B005K2XM94|4.0|This case works perfectly.  I gave it 4 stars only because the case doesn't close as flat as I thought it would.  No big deal, just keeps it from being perfect in my opinion.  Other than that, no complaints.  And it looks goooooooood.
B000002P2V|4.0|The Who / Who Are You (1996 four bonus tracks version): Not their best album, but has one of their best songs (Who Are You).  There is too much filler here, but it's still an essential recording for the good stuff that IS in it.  This is, of course, the last Who album that Keith Moon would be involved with before his unnecessary death (a case of `accidental suicide' - to borrow a phrase from John Mayall).  However, getting back to the album, this is a good but not great album.  It gets Four Stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good game for being free. the only game I don't like is the aguarium game.but mostof the others are really good.
B001675YQ6|5.0|My review title is one of the last lines in the movie. Loved it and that is the truth. Hard to describe the movie other than it has to do with our lives are never scripted, and if we let go and let life happen, it will. Imagination perhaps a drug.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Submarine is a thoughtful, stylish, azure-tinted coming-of-age story that tells a familiar tale in a clever but never pretentious way. Oliver Tate is young, alienated and beset by delusions of grandeur. He believes he is supremely important yet his place in the universe has not yet revealed itself--aside from being an accessory to the occasional pond-plunge for the fat girl at school. He spies on his parents' love-making habits and tinkers in his room or stands pensively at the ocean's edge, awaiting inspiration that seems a long way off. Enter the girl in the stark red jacket who would change his life for the better--or at the very least add a little color. Relatedly, Oliver's ex-actress mother is searching for a bit of color herself to save her from the pervasive doldrums that plague her marriage with a marine biologist and chronic depressive whose only relatively alluring feature--beyond his stellar beard--is his ability to create relationship mix-tapes that encompass both passionate beginnings and unavoidable despondency. The way in which Oliver's mother tries to save herself is quite comical as she attempts to join forces with a neighboring `ninja' whose self-help ramblings end up relating to improving one's sphere of color by never-fully-explained self-transcendence. Color, inevitably, conjoins the worlds of both Oliver and his distant parental units. It is of supreme importance. Submarine, as a whole, manages to balances Oliver's quasi-romantic exploits with his attempts to alter the grim course of his parents` marriage without seeming the least bit manipulative or over-done. The visual palate is washed out but peppered by various flairs such as title cards and fades to red or blue. The dialogue is snappy as an asp in your palms and without a doubt, the performances by young Noah Taylor and Yasmin Paige are phenomenal. Overall, anyone familiar with the work of Wes Anderson or Noah Baumbach should be feel comfortable wading into these waters. The film is melancholic without being depressing and relatable without being stale: biting with dry wit, arsonist young love and all the fast-cut magic of modern cinema, it is not to be missed.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great!!!!! Easy to use. Love all of the features. It seems faster to find a specific verse than flipping the pages of a Bible in book form.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app! lots of games and a good variety of concepts... great time filler. two thumbs up from me!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|great game if it would just stay on. just goes blank mid play. once. you fix it will give 5 stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Regular updates are always improving this already wonderful app. I enjoy the reading plan options. Many many translations, plus audio Bibles for select translations!
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging and relaxing, excellent graphics. definitely worth the cost. I would highly recommend this to a non-gamer type like me. who is more puzzle oriented
B00005JLR2|5.0|I bought this movie for my little brother for Christmas because he's really into animation and storytelling.  Treasure Planet is easily one of his favorite animated films.  The animation itself (especially the parts done by Glen Keane) is beautiful and impeccable.  The music, by James Newton Howard (incidentally one of my favorite composers), suits the film perfectly.  The adaptation of the story from Treasure Island is clever and engaging.  It was a fun way to revisit the book of my childhood.  Overall a great family movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just got the app on Kindle Fire, it looks great and have found no bugs or errors yet.  Much easier to play on my Kindle then my phone.  Would love to be able to play the game on Google Plus through my Kindle Fire though. Great game overall, five star rating today.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Ordered this as a gift. My daughter, a movie buff, had already seen the movie and liked it, placing it on her gift list. Great price and fast shipping from Amazon.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm a sucker for mahjong games, and this is one of my favorites, 5 bucks is a bit steep but its a good game.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Having grown up in this era, I found this film, as well as the book, to fairly depict the horrible conditions that people of color had to endure in order to survive. It also illustrates how \\"people of privilege\\" really had no clue as to the emotional damage they meted out on a regular basis.  Trusting enough to have their children's rearing entrusted to someone whom they didn't trust to use their in-house bathroom facilities.  Very poignant.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Decided to give this one a go.  Many of the gripes were spot on.  especially the controls and precision with some of the games control.  However, the word is FREE.  For a free item, this games will pull you in.  Great airport time killer or just looking to take a break.  I recommend you give it a try.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows. Season 1 is PACKED with tons of extras! Including, a third disc with only extras!! Easy to navigate through the menus and find exactly what you are looking for. If you're not already watching this show, YOU SHOULD BE!! Worth every penny! If you're still reading this you've thought about it too long! Buy the season! You won't regret it!!
B004GHBQCE|5.0|I've never reviewed a CD before. I'm no critic, I don't know all the aspects that contribute to a true review. However, I personally guarantee that if you purchase this album, you WILL NOT be disappointed. This is basically a cover album, he covers many songs by varying artists (e.g. Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode, Desperado by the Eagles) They are all very heartfelt songs, some of them could put tears in your eyes (stemming from personal experience.) He's very emotional in this album, and put all he had left into it. The music is beautiful, simply beautiful, and performed so well. Johnny Cash passed away on September 12, 2003, and this album was released in 2002, making it his last studio album before he passed away. It's rather like his last testament, this is much more dark and emotional than the other American albums. The whole album is beautiful, and sad, but not in the least bit disappointing. I recommend this to anyone, not just Johnny Cash fans.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Meh. its ok. not that great. some games work funky on the kindle. could be.better. prices for games are a.little steep.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I don't mind these free apps because it will be nice to give my kids, when I have them of course.  I think the graphics could be a bit sharper.  Everything seemed a bit pixelated.  I'm sure it'll matter more on a tablet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|free solitaire app. runs great, few adds, fair amount of options. I would reccomend to any solitaire fan. five stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Totally fun and gives me something to do while killing time. My daughter and I enjoy competeing against one another for highest score.
0812550706|3.0|Most of this book centers on the training of a genius child (Ender) in a series of brutal war games in an orbiting space station in hopes that he will be able to defeat an alien enemy that once tried to invade the earth. Ender (along with just about everyone else in the book) is, for the most part, an unsympathetic conscienceless pragmatist. The book worked as a dystopia, a commentary on the inhumanity of war, etc., but I had a hard time really enjoying it since I felt no connection to any of the main characters.
B005GVF95O|5.0|I decided to make a good review to restore some balance to the rating system because of the guy with no family.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game to play right before bed on my kindle fire. my son and daughter love to play it as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game and a good time killer I can't stop playing it at times love it on the kindle.
B00009NQQO|5.0|This toy is just as advertised. A small hoop and some balls. My 21 month old loves it and the fact that the hoop is actually a basket and the ball stay in there is a plus I think. It seems to be good quality  and the suction cups hold well which has been a problem with other bath items.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Very, very overpriced!  I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas, but was almost too embarrassed to give it to him because it looked so, so cheap.  The product may be ok, but it looks like it should have cost about $5.99.  I wish I had read more reviews first.
B001HN6922|5.0|Since I bought it and gift 4 my god son on the christimas, I've not seen the show yet till three weeks after I went visited my god son house to seen the movie dat I wants know how it was run good. I saw 'em a very excellent shows is good movies.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is really addictive.  No loud, smashing arcade-type game, but a calm, serene thinker's game.  It was well worth 99 cents!

B005T87QCI|2.0|Not much content. Only 6 robots in the game. Took around twenty minutes to play through game three times, including the hardest setting.  I'm not sure what I'm more upset about, the waste of my dollar or the waste of my twenty minutes.

B000002UUX|5.0|Actually tied with Master of Puppets as best ever.  Certainly better than any other Metallica record besides MOP by leaps and bounds.  All the other five star reviews are worth more for reading I just wanted to put my five star rating in the mix!
1423136802|5.0|9 yr old G-son loves this set. He watched the movie and then has been reading the books steady. What ever it takes to get him to read anything.
B005GVF95O|5.0|LMAO @ Superman75. That was great! The app works great on Droid X2. I apologize as a parent and a person who works with children, to the heartless &quot;adults&quot; out there that didn't get a FREE app today because it was steared toward children's interest. Instead of complaining, write your own app to suit your needs and let the children enjoy something today...
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is addicting fun! Everyone should try it. My kids showed it to me and I love this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great, relaxing game. beautiful backgrounds, and the music is very calming. I would recommend this game to anyone who just wants to unwind and chill.
B000003TAR|5.0|As I said, this album combines all of Nirvana's best aspects and serves them up on a platter. If one was to make a Beatles metaphor, I think this is Nirvana's \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" album because they were going into avant-garde territory and Kurt wound up making a piece of sonic art with \\"In Utero\\". This was the first contemporary cassette I had ever heard and it touched me because this album has a very human and vulnerable sound that's very rare to hear in music. Even in the harder songs, the humanity is so evident and strikes something internally that can't be denied (this isn't just nostalgia talking ha). These songs are all 5 out of 5 and flow like a body of art.<br />Some people won't understand songs like \\"Milk It\\" or \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" or \\"Tourettes\\" but that's ok. Some of the best things created don't make sense.<br /><br />If you don't own this already, buy it, you won't regret it.

B005OOL1IC|4.0|Obviously I must be missing something with the Ultraviolet digital copy because I'm not finding it to be near as bad as everyone else is saying it is. First off, you can download it onto multiple computers...and even if you don't have it on a certain computer you can stream it from flixster (for three years). I've got an app on my iPhone that I can stream all my Flixster movies to. I'm thinking this is much better than your standard digital copy...but hey I seem to be the only one with a favorable opinion of the service!
B002BWP49C|1.0|Seldom do I see movies that are profoundly, intrinsically reprehensible. Breaking Dawn was one of those movies. It's the sort of film that would-be abusers and pedophiles probably dream of; and so tedious that it will put the rest of us to sleep.<br /><br />This movie consists of three main events: a wedding, a honeymoon, and a pregnancy/birth. All of these are a thin veil for the true point of this film: that the noblest and rightest course of action a woman can take is to be cut open and bleed out for the sake of a fetus that every expert she's consulted predicts will die anyway. There is a lot of blood, gore and horror - but that's the \\"romantic\\" part. Somewhere, lost deep in this quagmire, are a few doomed attempts at excitement, but these are fleeting and inconsequential.<br />I will discuss in more detail the movie as a whole, but first, what makes it truly appalling: the spousal abuse, irrational pro-fetus and anti-woman message, and pedophilic overtones. (spoilers below)<br />First...the pro-woman-dying message (which consumes the entire latter part of the movie: the pregnancy/birth. I say \\"pro-woman-dying\\" because to call this pro-life is as hideous a travesty as calling Dr. Mengele \\"pro-life\\". This is not a story of a woman who finds herself pregnant and \\"chooses life\\"; this is the story of a woman who finds herself pregnant, is told by experts (a doctor, and both a human and vampire woman with supernatural sight) that the baby and she will die, and, even as she is starving nigh unto death, persists in this doomed pregnancy. As an emergency delivery is necessitated, she is the one who demands that they cut her open before the pain killer has kicked in because \\"he's suffocating!\\"; she is the one who gives the order for her stomach to be cut open and the infant removed, while she bleeds out on the table. Naturally, in this twisted fantasy, the baby *doesn't* die - and, although the skeletal Bella looks like she could be something out of Dr. Mengele's operating room as she bleeds out on the table, never fear. You see, being starved, having her ribs broken, and being gutted was only the prelude to an eternity of happily ever after - just as the doctor and the other people who had any way of knowing were wrong about the infant, they're wrong about her too: she is revived, lovelier and more alive than ever before. The effects of starvation are gone, the wounds are healed; and, on top of it all, she is now immortal. Choosing a gory, horrid death for yourself because you carry a zygote, you see, is really just the key to making all of your dreams come true.<br />Secondly...spousal abuse. Bella wakes up after her wedding night to find their room torn to pieces and herself covered in bruises because, dontcha know, Edward \\"can't control\\" himself with her. She, of course, delighted in this encounter, and spends what seemed like an eternity chasing Edward (now remorseful, and swearing not to touch her) around their honeymoon island, begging for him to do it again. As with the first point, this is yet another appallingly backwards, misogynistic message for young people (this movie's target audience). Bella is only brutalized because he loves her so much; she loves it, begs for more, and gets it. So, don't worry girls...those bruises are a token of affection, and those hangups where you need to beg and beg and beg for intimacy are really your fault - because you do this to him!<br />Finally...pedophilia. Jacob has, throughout the series, been an interesting cross of inflated ego and lack of testicular fortitude. Now, add to that illustrious resume, pedophile; because, maybe fifteen minutes after she's cut out of her non-sedated mother, Jacob comes in and \\"imprints on\\" Bella's newborn. If that sounds dirty, there's good cause; because (as was clearly stated earlier in the movie, for those fangirls who will try to delude themselves otherwise) he's marking her as his future mate - something that she has no control over, but will be forced to \\"be happy\\" with. Don't worry, though...Papa Edward does what any father would do, and radiates pride as he declares that his wife's ex has just \\"imprinted on\\" their fifteen minute old baby. Some people are naturals at parenting, right?<br /><br />These are the lowlights of this appalling waste of time. The full chronology of the movie goes something like this:<br />Bella whines and pouts about having to wear a dress and heels to her wedding.<br />Edward reveals his \\"rebel\\" past, and vampires everywhere die of laughter.<br />Bella has a nasty nightmare about her and Edward killing everyone at their wedding.<br />Bella sulks through her wedding.<br />Bella forces Edward to abuse her on their wedding night.<br />Bella chases Edward around the island, for a long time, begging him to do it again.<br />Bella ends up crying because of Edward's rejection; Edward finally gives in.<br />Bella realizes she's pregnant; the big bad wolves (Jacob's pack) aren't happy.<br />Bella almost starves to death; Jacob rebels against the wolves, and swears to protect Bella.<br />Bella gets cut open and bleeds to death.<br />Jacob imprints on the infant; the nasty wolves go home.<br />Everyone is happy. Hooray.<br /><br />I cannot emphasize enough what utter trash this movie is. The first three were enjoyable; this is complete tripe. The author's perverse fundamentalism overshadows everything else, and this becomes not a silly romance, but an appalling piece of misogynist propaganda. Save your time and money; if you're really desperate, find some drying paint to watch. That will be more entertaining, and less offensive.on't worry, though...Papa Edward does what any father would do, and radiates pride as he declares that his wife's ex has just \\"imprinted on\\" their fifteen minute old baby.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|Sarah Butler does one hell of a job in this film. To tell you the truth, I prefer this version more than the original. The revenge scenes make any man think twice of hurting a woman this way. This film is a classic case of the old saying \\" WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND\\". Do you believe in karma, if not , you better start. Especially if your with a girl named SARAH or JENNIFER!!!.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun but didn't blow me out of the water.  since its free I cant really complain. definitely worth the download.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app.... quick, easy, and detailed. also love the radar. the color choices are also cool and make it more personalized.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|And would like if the app had a &quot;study Bible&quot; feature so I could have more quality understanding of the Word.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is one of the CD's (OK - one of the albums on my solar powered MP3 player) that I would take with me if stranded on a desert island.  My parents, who were not prone to buying either popular music or jazz, had a copy of this album, which I discovered in their meager record collection.  As a teenager, I wore out the grooves on the LP.  To this day, I always keep an extra copy of the CD in the house (please note -  not a copy that I made with a computer, but a bona fide \\"store bought\\" copy).  I've probably given away a dozen copies to friends and family over the years.  It's one of those albums I put on when I'm looking to lift my spirits, or when I feel like celebrating, or practically any time.  Highly recommended!

1400076943|5.0|I loved this book. I think Adichie is a wonderful writer and makes Nigeria come alive. Some of my friends have difficulties reading African writers because they write in a different way than American writers, but I think Adichie does a good job of infusing both. I read this book because I love African novels. I think many African writers are able to tell (a somewhat fictionalized) a better social history of Africa's near past that most academic books. If you are interested in learning about Africa and particularly about the struggle between tribal beliefs and the adoption of Christianity in Nigeria I think this is a great book. It also gives you a glimpse of Nigerian politics and corruption that is very interesting.

B004NJDJYS|3.0|** spoiler alert ** I recently read We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver. I checked it out on my mother's recommendation. She liked it a lot. I thought it was so-so. I'd give it about 3 stars.<br /><br />It was pretty hard to get into at first. I feel like the beginning of the book really dragged. Shriver talked A LOT about the \\"past\\" and I think it could have benefited from some editing. Some of it was important to build up the context, but some of it just went on forever and ever seemingly without end. I figured if my mom really liked it I should continue plowing through it but it was difficult at first. I'd look at it every night on the nightstand and sigh. About halfway through the book when more of the \\"action\\" started to happen I stopped dreading it so much.<br /><br />The good: the topic was of course interesting. With this rise in school shootings it gives you a lot to think about. I read Jodi Picoult's 19 Minutes which was also about school shootings and I liked it a bit more. It told the story from all different sides (rather than from just the mother of the perpetrator like this one). Of course, like all Picoult books, the ending kind of sucked so it wouldn't get 5 stars either. I did like that it gave the perspective of the mother of a shooter which I think is something we often don't get to see or think that much about. I just wish the writing would have been a little better so that I could have enjoyed that perspective more.<br /><br />The \\"bad\\"/things I have questions about:<br /><br />1. The family seemed inauthentic. Why didn't the family have an intervention earlier? Clearly Kevin was NOT normal and was very disturbed. I find it hard to believe that the father would excuse EVERYTHING away and that the mother wouldn't have tried harder to get some professional help. If his personality \\"disorder\\" or whatever wasn't SO exaggerated I would have bought this plot/story line more. But he seemed so extreme that I find it hard to believe that it would go on like this until the shooting happened. With the real school shootings that happened many of them did have interventions of some sort or the personality flaws weren't as exaggerated. They still missed a lot of signs but for most of them they weren't life-long issues like Kevin was cast to have in this story.<br /><br />2. The whole writing letters to Franklin thing got old and was pretty predictable. At the beginning I thought maybe they were divorced but by the middle of the book I knew he was dead and it was more of a journaling exercise. I think that it was maybe a good idea but not executed well. Especially when there were dialogue portions, etc. No one would actually write like that in a letter. Maybe an infusion of letters in-between standard chapters of \\"story-telling\\" would have been more effective.<br /><br />3. Going along with point #1, I felt like the mother self-sabotaging came off very inauthentic. Even if the unimaginable happened I would have found many of her behaviors questionable. I can't of course say for sure, never having been in that situation, but I just find it hard to believe that she would try and ruin her life even further by acting like such a bozo (especially in the civil court case-related parts).<br /><br />4. I hated the ending. Why did she make a sudden change of heart happen for Kevin? Shriver built him up for the whole book to be a cold, calculating person. And at the end, through no medical or psychological intervention, he suddenly has regrets? He was horrible the whole novel, blinded his sister and all of a sudden he has a change of heart in the juvenile lock-up? I just groaned at that part. It would have been better if he would have stayed cold through the end. It would have left a bigger impact to have to think about him being so cold and sociopathic and to think about him getting out and going to live with his mom after that. Instead she tried to leave us with some hope that he was actually a nice kid who made a mistake...we don't always need a happy ending.<br /><br />Usually my mom and I have similar tastes and perspectives, but in this case not really. I'll have to see what other reviews said.similar tastes and perspectives, but in this case not really. I'll have to see what other reviews said.
078401020X|5.0|\\"Basic Instinct\\" made Sharon Stone a solidified movie star and became one of the biggest commercial hits of the 1990's grossing an amazing $352,927,224 at the box office.<br /><br /> Michael Douglas also stars as a San Francisco police detective (very similar to his televison role on \\"The Streets of San Francisco\\") investigating the murder of a wealthy former rock and roll star. Stone's character, Catherine, is the prime suspect, as she was seen with the rock star last the evening of his death.<br /><br /> The movie is suspenceful, riveting, nail-biting and comes with the question, \\"Is she really the killer? (referring to Catherine).<br /><br /> Sharon Stone was also known for doing one of the most expicit scenes ever filmed for an actress in the interrogation scene when she crosses her legs revealing no underwear!<br /><br /> \\"Basic Instinct 2\\" was released in 2006 and was a total flop both commercially and critically.<br /><br /> Former \\"Peyton Place\\" TV star Dorothy Malone (an Oscar winner) has a small part playing an old friend of Catherines.
0439023521|5.0|I requested several books from the library and was on hold for a while and then I got flooded by a ton of them at once. I prioritized my reading list by due date & by which ones couldn't be renewed. I landed on Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. I had heard RAVE reviews from several people but I wasn't too sure how I'd like it. I'm not too big into fantasy or sci-fi and most places I've seen this book have categorized it as such. In addition, it's a young adult book and while I think some YA books are ok I keep thinking at some point I might grow out of this genre. However, SO many people had recommend it I thought it had a good possibility of decent and when I read some brief summaries of the book it reminded me a lot of my favorite short story \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson that I thought I should give it a whirl.<br /><br />I am SO glad I did. This book was AWESOME. If I had to summarize it in one sentence it would be \\"Imagine 'The Lottery' meets Survivor and they have a baby and then you have The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />First and foremost, while I can see why it's labeled fantasy/sci-fi, it is SO not typical sci-fi/fantasy. It's like the X-Men version of sci-fi/fantasy. Sure there are some things that are not realistic and far-fetched, but it's mostly grounded in reality and the things that are \\"unrealistic\\" are background mostly and don't really detract from the story. While post-apocalyptic style stories do intrigue me, I think they've been slightly overdone so I was hesitant about this aspect of the book. However, like the sci-fi/fantasy aspect, it's mostly background. It's the whole reason for the story but they do not dwell on it really. The story mostly revolves around the actual \\"game\\" itself (leading up to it, going through it and the aftermath) and that stuff was REALLY exciting and compelling. It was such a unique story I couldn't put it down. Literally. I read it in 6 hours with only bathroom and lunch breaks.<br /><br />From the beginning it was hard to figure out who Katniss was. When I figured out she was a girl a while into the story (around page 14) I was a little surprised. As I read I had assumed that Katniss was a boy. This changed things a bit and made me a little more intrigued.<br /><br />Besides the setting/environment, I really drew a lot of parallels with \\"The Lottery\\" at the beginning. However, after the story gets going it leaves that short story behind and moves on into a more Survivor like story but in a more serious way.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the middle section once they are into the arena for the game. The preparation is interesting but I really couldn't put the book down once all of the contestants were fighting for their lives. I didn't see the \\"love story\\" coming, although it isn't misplaced or come out of nowhere but it wasn't something I predicted. It seemed very realistic and believable. Additionally, all of the struggles that the contestants had to go through in the game were also realistic and believable. Collins did a good job of creating an atmosphere of realism and I could definitely picture the setting from her words and imagery. One thing I thought was that the arena seemed bigger at the start of the game and seemed smaller by the end. Katniss journeyed forever on the first day and quite a lot on the second day but by the end it seemed like they could get anywhere in the arena in a few hours by the end. The complex emotions and personalities of the contestants was very interesting. A little Lord of the Flies but much more interesting and entertaining. The Truman Show parallels were also interesting to see. It's like Collins took some of the most interesting twists of all the above mentioned stories and wove them (very well) into this story. I don't mean to say this to make anyone think it's an old, tired story because they way she weaves it all together makes it fresh and interesting. I can just see some influences she may have had.<br /><br />Although it seemed clear (to me) from the beginning that Katniss would win the game, you were still worried for her throughout the story and really rooted for her the whole time. The twist with bringing her and Peeta together was unexpected and nice. At the beginning of the game I was wondering how Collins would work that one out...although Katniss had some clear resentment towards Peeta I didn't know that she would be able to kill him unless something really drastic happened. I'm glad that the twist made that not have to happen. And because things got changed up so much throughout the story, even though Katniss winning seemed predictable, I didn't mind because the story kept changing so you were sure HOW she would win, and there was a possibility at several points that she MIGHT not win.<br /><br />The one and only thing I didn't love was the ending of the book. The love story that emerged wasn't all that interesting to me, but mostly because I'm not a romance fan and particularly not in a YA novel. It would have been nice to end the book with a satisfying end rather than letting it linger, although obviously this left the end open for the subsequent books. I don't have a huge desire to continue the series, but since I got so involved with this book unexpectedly I am going to commit to the second book just in case it surprises me as well. This leads to a second tangent of something that I wasn't a HUGE fan of, although it didn't really detract from the story. Throughout the story I would forget that these \\"kids\\" were supposedly ages 12-18. They just didn't have a \\"teenage\\" voice. The characters were much more thoughtful and advanced than their supposed ages would seem. Again, their ages weren't really the point so it didn't detract from the story, but occasionally I'd reflect on it and think, no way, a 16 year old wouldn't be thinking about things like this. So it seemed a little unbelievable that they were actual young adults rather than young adult characters created by an adult author. But in terms of the overall book and story it was just a minor detail.<br /><br />Overall I would suggest this book to ANYONE (over the age of 14 probably). I give it 5 Stars and would probably classify it as one of the best books I've read all year. I really, really loved it. Obviously loved it enough to write a review of it which doesn't always happen.

B001ED7C58|5.0|A great soundtrack if you're a Twilight Fan. A must have i you love the books to releate the songs to the story. I am happy I bought it.
0375758992|3.0|The reason I chose this book was because it was about Africa, and I thought Zimbabwe specifically. What it turned out to be is more about Fuller's extremely eccentric family with Africa (various countries) as a backdrop. It was a fairly good read, just not what I expected. Written smoothly for fast reading. The only hard part is that she jumps around in time a bit and that can be a little harder to follow considering how much they moved and the socio-political events at the time. I would recommend this as a summer/vacation read, particularly if you are interested in families or family dysfunction, but less so if you are looking to read much more about Africa.
B006J8990Y|5.0|This movie was great. Glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews. The extras are great also. Thanks to all the scientists that are working in this field.
0374531269|4.0|This was a good book. Of course, it is horrifying to read. No one likes to think about child soldiers, but this one does a good job of giving you enough details to feel engrossed in the story, but not so much gratuitous violence that it makes you overwhelmed. After reading it I read some news accounts that Beah has greatly exaggerated his experience and that the book may not be entirely true. If that bothers you then I guess don't read it. It doesn't bother me because it still seems like a very good and plausible story. I am not an expert in child soldiers so this was a very accessible book to me.

B000068FXX|5.0|Supertramp's fifth album Even In The Quietest Moments... was originally released in April 1977 and was recorded between November 1976 to January 1977 at Caribou Ranch Studios in Colorado and finished at The Record Plant in Los Angeles. The album was quite a big hit reaching #16 on the Billboard charts.<br /><br />The album itself is nothing short of a masterpiece for the band. It rates, for me, as highly as Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America with the feel being a bit more somber. The album starts off with one of the band's biggest hits in Give A Little Bit sung by Roger Hodgson with a nice flourish of acoustic guitars. Lover Boy is a catchy upbeat song with fun lyrics written by Rick Davies. Even In The Quietest Moments is a nice Roger ballad while Rick's Downstream is a bit more upbeat. Roger's Babaji starts the second half in a faster mood. Rick's From Now On is a nice easygoing song. The album ends with it's longest song Fool's Overture which starts off with a sound scape including a church bell and Winston Churchill's voice before leading into the songs main synth hook which gives way to a nice ballad section. A fantastic record and highly recommended!

0061122416|1.0|The author does create a nice picture with the words, but it is filled with far too much unnecessary drivel.  There is a book that I read when I was a boy, and it is still one of my favorites as an adult.  Written by Uri Shelevitz, \\"The Treasure\\" is basically the same story (without the love interest and the Personal Legend garbage).  I suggest saving the hours you might read this book and check out \\"The Treasure\\" at your local library.  It will only take you about 5 minutes to read.

0452270073|2.0|Well, looks as if I'm a lone wolf concerning these books, and now I know why I had never heard of Pat Barker.  I read about a book a week and I am so upset that I wasted my time on these.  If you're looking for literature that gives you some insight about World War I, you shouldn't waste your time and money either.  There is so much worthwhile literature out there.  I must say that a lot of times I am quite disappointed in Booker Prize winners.  ((What were they thinking?)
0062073494|5.0|Tales of detection often depend upon a closed community of characters to provide a limited cast of victims and suspects. Christie has used estates of the wealthy, as in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, but she also set many of her stories at resorts, on islands, on boats, and on trains where one of her detectives happens to find him or herself.<br /><br />The Murder on the Orient Express is a brilliant counterpoint to her, island based, And Then There were None. Christie further isolates the famous train through use of a track-blocking snow storm which allow Hercule Poirot to exercise his resolvent powers.<br /><br />This novel transfered very well to the screen, but the book can be read with enjoyment even by those of us who have viewed the film also.<br /><br />Of Christie's eighty-some detective stories, this one rates with her best.<br />I have no hesitation giving it 5 stars. I love it and will read in again.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Of all the new books that have come out in the past year this one has been by far one of the best.  Instead of the same old same old a new and interesting subject has been brought forth.Sharing the tale of a boy's grandfather while dealing with somewhat distant parents spurs the boy into a world of delight and sorrow.  A search for something unbelievable and yet the boy knows he must find the truth.  Great twists and turns from the beginning.  This is not your normal paranormal type of book that is put out by the dozens. A wonderful story where love prevails.  Read this book!!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I loved this movie. This is coming from someone who has yet to read this novel. I've only read Pride and Prejudice so I'm not a complete newbie. What I do think this movie has going for it is great casting, and a very streamlined story. I'm sure this novel had so much more to put in. And if it was going to be a miniseries like the fabulous Pride and Prejudice in the 90s, then they could fit all the details in. But because this was a 90 min movie, they had to chop some stuff.   I found the Anne such a likable character. She has flaws, but is mostly a great heroine. I also loved the character of Wentworth. I think he was played very well, from someone new to this material.   The tone of the movie was great. I loved all the outdoor, cloudy scenes. And I especially loved the water. Such a great use of setting to get the tone just right. I also loved when Anne would stare into the camera. It was always jarring, but she had such wonderful expression that it really touched me.   As always, I loved the costumes and everyone seemed really in character for the time.   My only complaint would be the sometimes odd use of the shaky cam. I liked it when it was used for example with Anne and Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law (already forgot their names...). At this moment, it was a perfect time to show the absolute torment Anne was feeling with the use of shaky cam.   Otherwise, I adored this movie, especially as a newbie to this material.
B003I55BIA|5.0|You'll immediately fall in love with the characters. I read this book in one night, then downloaded the 'sequels '. It's the ultimate bad boy fantasy. It gets your blood pumping and heart racing with every detail. There is a little Spanish mixed into the story, some of it easily interpreted some I had to look up. But its full of teenage angst, love, and lust. Definitely worth the read!!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|**Spoilers in this review.   The hunger games was ok, but even that was pretty darn sadistic.  The problem with all 3 books is sadism.  In the second book, big surprise, back in the arena for our little girl to get tortured some more.  Third book, full scale war, but not many details.  More of the same little girl who can't seem to reason at all and I don't care all that much about, whom everyone loves and has 2 guys after her all the time. No sense of humor by the author.  No characters seem to change or grow.  Peeta changes, sorta,  but is mostly helpless and doesn't do much.    Kids killing each other for sport?  Even the Roman's had better sense than this. Is the author trying to 'one up' Hollywood here?      The main point of this series seems to be to show how terrible war and suffering is, yet that is really the main selling point.  The whole Hunger Games trilogy is really a Gladiator type of story brought to horrific proportions and not letting up. Almost no philosophy or reasoning ABOUT war and torture.  It's no wonder its becoming a movie now, since people really love sadism more than anything else, especially in the U.S.  A main plot point is that the whole gruesome thing is televised and turned into a sport.     Just doesn't seem plausible at all. Yea you had the Arena in Rome, but you had a good chance of living in a fight there, and Gladiators were not children picked at random to fight until only one lives, and then later picking up that winning child and saying, oh your going in again, good luck.      The main character Katniss did not really grow up, she never seemed to understand war, even at the end when she does silly things like trying to go after the big bad guy on her own.  Really?  That's like running into Nazi Germany going after Hitler with some friends of yours with cameras and a few weapons!     Fashion and blood?  Oddly enough, fashion seems to be very important to the author.  Of course the young girl, like in so many stories these days, has 2 guys to choose from and is the center of everyone's attention, and looks fabulous with her hair designers and dress makers, just before going in to kill people.  No humor at all in these stories, by the way.  If the fashion thing sounds funny, its really just bizarre and out of place in the books.    The war at the end was illogical.  A couple of times in the book we are reminded how the Capitol relies on the districts for resources such as food.  Later  the districts have won their freedom and cut off supplies to the capitol. The painfully obvious course of action is to wait and starve them in to surrender, or just ignore them cautiously while you rebuild.  Instead, the rebels push forward into  traps that kill hundreds of people, and a few main characters to get to the big bad guy.      The Good:  The final ending was a little bit of a surprise, with the Rebel President doing something evil.  All the books read fast and there is a lot of action.  You develop sympathy for a lot of the characters, although I didn't relate to any of them.  The settings are good, a contrast of the rich capitol with the starving districts.     I wonder if the Capitol could be seen as the USA, a spoiled rich government dependent on other countries while caring little for others lives outside its own borders?

B00007KWHG|2.0|I don't have this disc yet.  I cancelled my order because of a few reviews stating bad sound quality on a lot of tracks.  I found a similar track list on The Definitive Pop Collection Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons by the same publisher, but it's 2 discs and has no sound quality complaints.  Could the degraded sound quality be from squashing the same set list into one disc instead of 2?  Since they're from the same publisher it's probably the same remasters.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This has been one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. A review simply does not do the book justice.<br /><br />The title, American Sniper, could not be more accurate. It isn't American Sniping. This is not a book about snipers in general, it is a book about Chris Kyle, who happens to be a sniper. Had Kyle been a corpsman or other role in his SEAL team, the book would be just as interesting and enjoyable.<br /><br />What impressed me most is how the book strikes the right balance between operational descriptions and how Kyle served. I particularly enjoyed the first-person comments by his wife, Taya. They gave another perspective to the difficulties that face any service member and are a great reminder that no man serves in a vacuum.<br /><br />Kyle (and his writers) do an outstanding job explaining the technology and terminology behind the anecdotes as well. The pacing is excellent and at no point did I find myself wishing it would go faster, or even slower.<br /><br />You get to really know Chris Kyle in this book. If you want a book that is heavy on technique and action, this probably isn't what you're looking for. But if you want to get to know the person who did these extraordinary deeds in a very personal and blunt way, American Sniper is for you.
B0058HDHIC|5.0|Ane Brun's new album \\"It All Starts With One\\" shows the singer-songwriter's darker side. Accompanied by accentuated drumming and minimalist arrangements, her fragile voice carries you through the melancholic songs with lightness and grace.  Ane Brun was once called another suicidal Scandinavian singer. She made fun of it in a Berlin concert a couple of years ago. Her new album \\"It All Starts With One\\" will probably provoke more comments like that.  Disk One is a carefully put together, tight and matching series of songs, while Disk Two is more of a varied mix of styles. While it took me some time to connect to some of the songs, I still agree with the BBC that Ane Brun \\"has managed to create her finest record yet\\".  The first ten songs are not easily accessible, and surely nothing you'd like to put on as background music. I had to sit down and listen to them carefully to appreciate them.  The second disk in the deluxe version of \\"It all starts with one\\" comes almost as a relief after the melancholic journey of the first one. It is less intense and more playful, and therefore more accessible.   It is probably clear by now that I would recommend to buy the deluxe version to have that balance of new and old Ane Brun. She has developed as an artist, and still stays the same.   I wrote a longer review here: [...]

B006IVBSBU|2.0|I was so looking forward to this movie.  A  big disappointment.  Paltrow was her nasally self and looked and sounded exactly as she always does in every movie I've seen her in even though she was supposed to be sick, and in one scene, dead (sorry, fans).  Kate Winslet was absolutely believable as a physician and flu victim.  This movie was a big waste of her time and talent.  There wasn't a crumb of suspense or information about what was going on you couldn't learn from Henry the Hand.  Matt Damon should deny any involvement and sue for use of his image.  I truly didn't get the point of this movie...Zero plot, zero thrill, zero info, zero everything.
0312576463|2.0|I was intrigued by the plot of the book as many of the topics hit close to home (from the fact that I work at 3M in St Paul to family members involved in anti-overpopulation \\"radical\\" groups, close friends experiencing extra-marital affairs, teenagers going to the utmost political opposite side than the parents, etc. ). I read it fast - it was easy to keep turning the pages (which is why I gave it 2 starts instead of 1). But I finished with a bad taste,  thinking \\"give me a break, this can't be one of the best books of the year\\".     Why? Characters were overflawed (especially the women - there is not one SINGLE female on the book that captured an iota of my sympathy, not one... can Franzen create* real* female characters?). Some of the sub plots were bordering unbelievable (Joey the war-profiteering teenager,  Connie's eternal devotion without self-doubts or jealousy, Walter's ingenuity regarding Vince's motives behind the Cerulean  Trust,  Patty's parents reaction to her rape, Patty's long friendship with her crazy stalker, etc).  First I thought maybe I was jaded because I had clear expectations about some of the characters and experiences, having lived trough some of those, but no, that's not the main issue... the problem is that most of the book  wasn't \\"real\\" enough, or as another reviewer said, \\"I did not believe it\\". The other 1- and 2-star reviews here pretty much add to this one - I mostly agree with those too, no need to repeat all the 100 other reasons the book is not great at all.

0061124265|4.0|This is one of the better Paulo Coelho books out there, even though the story isn't the most surprising.  It is a very predictable book, but that doesn't really take away from the message that Mr. Coelho is trying to convey.  Sometimes we take the miracle of life for granted and we should all be living each day as if it is our last.  There are several passages in this book that I found incrediby moving.  I do feel that some of the events of the book are a little out there and didn't really add to the story. They could have been left out altogether.  Those are the reasons I knock it a star, but still recommend this book as I enjoyed it.  I would especially recommend this book to those who feel indifferent to the world or kind of done with society.  It gives an alternative view that might be insightful.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|Hollywood is really running out of ideas. They tried to remake the Karate Kid movie and even used Jackie Chan but nothing is like the original.  I'm not going to rehash on the plots or anything like others do. Basically the first 3 movies are a mentor/student relationship that turns into a friendship. It's great for all ages with humor, drama, and a nice amount of Karate action.  The 4th movie, The Next Karate Kid was an embarrasement. It tries to bring the same quit witty humor and the audience of the first Karate Kid but also include females. Having a female \\"Karate Kid\\" was great but they producers really didn't do a great job with the plot, character developement or anything. If anyone has not seen the first 3 movies, they would really be lost as to Mr. Miagi (sorry about spelling) references to Daniel Son. The producers and writers also jump right into the movie with how he knows this particular woman and everything else. They do not even attempt to have some form of closure to what happen to Daniel Son or where he was.  The collection is great. If you are just looking for a good collection of the movies without a lot of extras, such as behind-the-scenes and such then this movie collection is for you. If you are wanting all the other extras, you may find them in a 2 disk set for each movie or another combo set. I like watching the movies more than I do about the behind the scenes. I don't mind some of the behind the scenes or deleted clips once in a while, I just don't like spending a huge amount of money for collections or multi-disk DVDs with them included. This was the perfect collection of the the original 3 and including the 4th movie which I did not like.  I give the collection a 5 star because it's all together in a great fashion. No mess, no waste, and no trouble getting the DVDs out or even knowing which movie is on which disk. Each disk is in it's own box. The only thing that I did not like about the 3rd DVD is that it's a double sided DVD with the 3rd and 4th movies; one on each side of the disk. I still give it a 5 star only because I also think the 3rd movie wasn't as great as the first 2 but most definately better than the 4th.

B005KJZDXK|3.0|I purchased A Very She and Him Christmas because I like indie rock and alternative music and was interested in some holiday tunes for a christmas party.  The best track on this album is the exquisite and lovely \\"Christmas Waltz\\". Two tracks I would skip altogether is Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and Little Saint Nick, which was particularly annoying.  Zooey's finespun and delicate vocal style does not suit these tunes and the spare arrangement only reminded me of how much better the Beach Boys version of Little Saint Nick is.  Christmas Wish, featuring \\"Him\\" M. Ward sounded as if it was recorded in an empty gymnasium. The other tracks, especially \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" were nicely done. Overall, quite different than your typical Christmas album and certainly fit the bill for background music at my party.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Overview<br /><br />This film draws strongly from a wintry atmosphere, and the chills crawl as the snow gently falls and caresses the wilderness medieval setting. Gary Oldman puts in a great performance as a religious werewolf hunter of sorts. (Reminds me of Van Helsing). However, this movie rolls out with less action, but builds more on mystery and romance.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />- Strong suspense. A werewolf is living within their midst.<br />- Good Cinematography. Nice selection of scenes.<br />- Nice costumes and set designs<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Gothic romance seems a little overdone. Love triangle lacks chemistry<br />- Storyline seems a bit naïve when the villagers proceed to celebrate, in spite of being given substantial information that the werewolf is still alive. (seems to be a bit like Beowulf)<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Not a bad show to watch on a very cold evening.

0140185232|3.0|Reading this seminal novel about Americans abroad--with its clash of Yankee versus European work ethics and art appreciation--proves a challenge, but an enjoyable one. Even accepting that all characters are purely fictional, readers should be prepared to jump back and forth in time as the mood strikes Maugham, an author who gently interposes his own, modest persona as confident for several characters. We never know whose story will be interrupted by the sudden passage of time -elastic in the hands of this deft author--or sudden changes of milieu. We never are sure when other characters will be reintroduced by a chance meeting abroad, or which old characters will drop out of sight (not to mention, Society) for a few chapters. Many voices use the first person to relate their offstage stories, so it requires mental gymnastics to untangle the various threads which often meet--resulting in cruel or desperate emotional and social knots.   Regarding the plot: the not-so-omniscient narrator first indulges in praise and admiration for Elliot Templeton, that intercontienntal arch snob with his enviable but questionable accumulation and distribution of European art. Next the mild-mannered narrator, also an author, introduces his primary pair of star-crossed lovers. The cover of this edition shows a portrait of a young man, presumably Larry, who suffered some emotional epiphany as a result of a serious accident as a WW1 aviator. He has returned home prepared to spend his life \\"loafing,\\" despite his glorious assured future in Chicago business.   Throughout the intervening years the narrator learns intermittiently about Larry's life and pilgrimage in Europe--even as far as an Indian ashram--in search of the meaning of man's existence.  Isabel, too practical and accustomed to the life of modest  luxury which money and social status can provide, settles for a safe marriage to a young man on his way up, \\"a regular guy,\\" while secretly cherishing a deathless flame for her first love, Larry.   At odd moments readers also encounter Sophie and Suzanne, women whose stories reveal a kind of success and abject failure. Both the narrator and Larry float in and out of their lives, while Elliot gradually ages, becoming disenchanted by current social (and artistic) trends. Maugham presents two  extremes of religion: the middle-aged Catholic convert and the Hindu Yogi. Poor Larry never manages to become a believer but he ultimately finds peace with himself as an author/agnostic. His methods were simple: hard physical labor alternating with intense mental reading/study.   Readers must decide for themselves whether the novel does or does not end with a death or a marriage, as predicted in the disarmingly contradictory first paragraph.  All we can hope is that the characters who have become so alive to us have found their own form of success. Yet the unresolved international question remains: can Americans find lasting happiness in European society or settings?
0345444051|5.0|Humanity is about to launch its first manned mission to another world. Finally, the human race is about to escape its cradle and take its first step towards the stars. But on the eve of the launch the skies over the Earth's major cities are blotted out by the appearance of huge, alien spacecraft. The Overlords have arrived, and nothing will ever be the same again.  Arthur C. Clarke is one of the most famous writers the science fiction field has ever produced, thanks to his work on the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey and his role as a popular science commentator (he covered several of the Apollo moon landings for American television and had several successful TV series in the 1980s). Clarke's work is notable for its straightforwardness (he was never a great prose stylist) but also its scientific rigour. With a few exceptions, Clarke had little truck with what he considered to be some of the more fantastical concepts of SF (such as faster-than-light travel and artificial gravity) and did not use them in his work. In his view, the universe is vast, timeless and unknowable. Much of Clarke's work is notable for a certain melancholic optimism: the human race can be much more than it is now, but even so is unlikely to challenge the vastness of the universe.  Childhood's End was published in 1953 and was his fourth novel, although his first published in the United States, where it immediately established him as a major voice in the field. In many ways it is atypical Clarke. The aliens are comprehensible and easily relate to human beings, unlike the enigmatic entities of say 2001 or Rendezvous with Rama. At the same time, his normal scientific vigour is a little slacker than normal, as concepts such as telepathy and group consciousnesses are explored (Clarke had a passing fascination with the supernatural at the time, though later firmly rejected such notions). Clarke's influences are clear, with the presence of Olaf Stapledon particularly hard to ignore.  The novel is extremelyconcise, with my paperback copy clocking in at 160 pages. For its short page count, the novel is fairly epic. It is split into three sections, each with a distinct cast, focus and storyline (unsurprising, as the first section was originally a stand-alone short story). In the first, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has to oversee the painful transformation of humanity from bickering nation-states to a single world government. In the second, a family 'escape' the Overlords' utopia to live in an island commune free of their influence, only to discover the real reason for the Overlords' arrival on Earth. In the final section, a lone human who stowed away aboard an Overlord ship returns to Earth eighty years later (though only a few months later by his count, due to time dilation) to find a world vastly changed from the one he left. Clarke doesn't waste a word as he lets the story unfold inexorably, moving to a conclusion that looms somewhere between awe-inspiring and horrific.  As a novelist, Clarke was much more interested in ideas (thematic, scientific or both) than people. His characterisation was often variable, although Childhood's End is actually one of his better books in that regard. Its major protagonists (even the Overlords) are clearly defined and sympathetic. In terms of structure, Childhood's End is unusual in that the entire story is pre-ordained, and nothing any of the characters do can change what is happening. They - and the reader - can only witness it and make their own minds up about whether it is something that can be called 'good' or not, and I suspect many will fall on the 'not' end of the spectrum.  As a result Childhood's End can be viewed as a colossal tragedy. The book has a tremendous emotional charge as it poses a simple question: how would we face it if our way of existing ended tomorrow? Clarke's answer is surprisingly bleak but, one suspects, one that would be close to the truth.  The novel has aged in some respects. The firstedition opened with the USA and USSR battling to land a man on the moon, since Apollo 11 was still sixteen years in the future at the time it was published. Clarke also makes a very dated joke where he discusses how the Overlords have to force the rulers of South Africa to treat all their citizens equally regardless of skin colour. The 'joke' is that by this time majority rule in South Africa has been restored, and it's the white population that's being mistreated. An amusing aside in 1953 actually feels rather cynical today, assuming as it does that the African population would be as racist and authoritarian as the white one was. However, another point about how the people of Israel bitterly resist being absorbed into the Overlords' hegemony and giving up the freedom they have spent centuries fighting for, is more resonant. There's also a recurring problem in Clarke's work where he underestimates the power of religion, and the sequences where the Overlords' arrival causes the downfall of all world religions in a matter of months are rather unconvincing.  In most respects, Childhood's End (****½) has not aged badly at all, and its central themes of parenthood and the futility of railing against the night - but the effort nevertheless being laudable - remain interesting. The novel is available now in the UK and USA.

B003QSLDTA|5.0|This movie is great! I love Jamie Lee Curtis as a mom to a difficult teenager. Their adventure begins with a life changing event. The aftermath is hilarious. The movie is a remake of a 1960's Disney movie--also a favorite.  The characters are likable and endearing. The songs (in this new version) are great!  Jamie Lee Curtis is great as the Mom and Lindsay Lohan is wonderful as the rebellious daughter. The story of their interchanged lives is the crux of the movie and is played beautifully.   You can never go wrong with a Disney movie!

0439023513|3.0|SPOILER ALERT (read this after you've read the book)  I started reading this series about a week and a half ago and finished Mockingjay in one day (yesterday).  So, I haven't had time to fully digest the books, but my first impression is simply that I'm frustrated with the character development of the last book.  I kept waiting for Katniss to become more self-aware, especially with all she's been through and growing up so quickly, but it just never happened.  Even in the epilogue, 20 years later, she still doesn't seem to have the self-awareness I would've preferred, especially an awareness of why she married Peeta and chose to have children.  It just seemed like she married him because \\"that's what we do, we take care of each other\\" and she only had children because Peeta finally convinced her to have children.  Also, I don't know if it's just Collins' style to leave her readers with questions at the end of books, but I would've liked to read more about what was going on in Katniss' head when Coin brought up the idea of a Hunger Games for the children of the Capitol.  I assume she said yes to have a better chance to kill Coin, but then, why did Haymitch also agree?  Because he knew what Katniss was going to do?  It just wasn't clear.  While this series are the first fiction books I've really loved since Harry Potter (I read very little fiction), I just feel unsatisfied w/ MJ.  I think partly because I expect YA fiction to do a better job of wrapping up loose ends at the end of a series vs. adult fiction, which tends to have more of a purpose of just being thought-provoking.
0061120073|4.0|It's a pleasure to review this book on the centennary of its story-time (the book begins in 1912). Yes, this is a coming-of-age story, but it is also a portrait of urban poverty that speaks directly to the present. Tales of kids collecting the lead from liquor bottlenecks and cigarette-pack foil to redeem along with the family rags at the junk man´s--an extra penny for a pinch, for girls who can stand it--sheds light on the way we live now, and on what might yet lie ahead for us, as people once again start salvaging fat from restaurants (now to run their cars, rather than to make soap, as back then).     The characters are surprisingly bold. The emotions of sexual desire, exploitation, pleasure, pain, and trust are explicitly portrayed, without prurience, and it is refreshing, compared to the present, that the urges are shown to stem from the desire to procreate and also to be thwarted by their own success! There is no prettying up of either women or men, children or aged, and the 'deadbeat' father referred to in other reviews is a man of talent and longing as well as weakness.    If it weren´t for his complexity, and the main character´s loyal brother, the male sex might seem the weaker in this book, but Betty Smith was bigger than that. And if, as she herself said, sometimes what happens in this book is what should have happened, not what did happen, her realism and grit are more than sufficient to carry the day.    I can only imagine how much fun it must be for New Yorkers, let alone Brooklynites, to read this; but for all of us this is a book that zooms on the most fundamental plot: how people manage to live.

Wish it mounted a little higher though, but for the price and how it performs, it is good!  I was wondering how the \\"swivel\\" worked.  It is the flash bulb itself that can tilt up and be angled for bounce.
1400069181|5.0|i was chosen to read a copy & give a copy of this book away through the 'books for bloggers' program.  i thought this book was fabulous.  i have owned my own small business for the past year & from the beginning have donated a portion of all profits each month to causes i care about [clean water, bikes for kids in third world countries, meals for the terminally ill]. i have always been a strong believer in giving back.  each month, i donate at least a few times a month to give back in my community, as well.  reading this book was super inspiring. i absolutely agree that we can all live with a little less and there is always room to give a little more.  throughout the book, blake writes about other business owners that follow a similar model.  i enjoyed reading about 'regular' folks with huge dreams.   he also touches on struggles and advice for goals, dream, new & existing businesses.  i absolutely recommend this book for anybody that wants to bring this huge planet just a bit closer together.
B001E45XT4|3.0|You have to be sure you have the proper connectivity equipment, this headset requires a dual audio in/out adapter in order I function properly..   If Im not making my self clear there is one cord with 2 male connectors one is for the audio in and the other is for the audio out (mic)
0765350386|5.0|A great mix of ninja melee and a very creative system of Magic.  The story is part epic quest and part grand heist with a classic Master apprentice relationship at its heart.  A truly magnificent read that is well worth your time.  Unfortunately the series is all downhill from here.  The second book holds its own while the third book falls far short of both.  I am not entirely comfortable recommending this book because as a SERIES, I feel Mistborn ultimately disappoints.  That is a shame because this first book was nearly flawless.  The Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks has   a similar flavor to the mistborn books and is FAR more successful as a series with an equally excellent first book.  I would recommend that.
B005GVF95O|1.0|I actually thought this would be my real first puzzles boy was I disappointed, its actually my second. Yeah, superman rules
080214473X|5.0|The only other books that come close to this in terms of describing the battle field (in my humble opinion) are Killer Angels and Flags of our Fathers. With 700 plus reviews, it was with reservation that I undertook to write this, what more could be added. But this book was important to me because after reading it, I began to search for answers to questions such as when is it right to fight for human rights? What if that means going into a country that doesn't want your help? This is a really trite summary of my reflections after reading this book, but nonetheless the book really triggered me to think closely about all the conflicts we are involved in. The book also puts the reader in the middle of a culture so far removed from ours that it brings the principles of our western culture into view. In any case, this is still a book well worth reading that I would recommend to any mature reader.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I love this app! It is a great alternative to pushing coins endlessly into the belly of a quarter bin. Plus, it saves you a trip to the arcade. Sure its not as good as the real thing, but better than any other ios, or any other digital pinball game I've tried! I hardly notice the ads, and luckily haven't run into any inappropriate ones either. The controls are a little bit laggy, but nothing serious. The three tables in the free version are very fun. (although without all the cool blinking lights and sounds that people might enjoy) If I ever get bored with the current tables I have, I might even buy the full version. Overall, great app, and it will satisfy even the strongest of urges to go play pinball- hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B005GVF95O|3.0|I like this app for free but not worth paying for with only 14 puzzles.   A bit more challenging than others out there but I like it because it is a natural progression in difficulty for my 3 y/o.   Nice graphics and intuitive play/interaction.  Add some more puzzles for more stars.   Samsung Captivate
B006JPS1OM|4.0|love hide and seek games.would give it a 5 , but it is hard to tap on item. also it is a long download.
0062082353|5.0|While not high prose, this was a quick and interesting read. I totally support our troops and their actions so obviously am positively predisposed.  However, I think that the authors story is fascinating and important.  What our troops do to protect us should not be forgotten or dismissed. It is a pretty breezy and easy to read account of Chris' tours of duty and participation in many very important activities in the war. It is not a history book but one man's experiences during those historic moments.  I found it very informative about a particular aspect of the SEALs and sniping in particular; both topics that I do not know a lot about.  I enjoyed it and think that if you are interested in the war and or sniping then this is a worthwhile read.  Perhaps if you are an expert it might be detailed enough, but I liked it.  Thanks to Chris and all his brothers in arms for their sacrifice.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|it would be a much nicer app if it allows loading users' own pictures.  please add it on the next release.  thanx.

B006MHWXMS|5.0|This was a great free app when it was given away the other day. I have used gtasks, taskos, and others. I really like the UI and it integrates with Google perfectly. As a plus, the widget is really visually appealing and quite useful. Used on a Droid 2:

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day, and it's so useful that I feel guilty about not having paid for it.  The interface is clean. The snooze and dismiss options are brilliant.  It never malfunctions.  Get it.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I bought this as a time waster, and it looks like ill be playing it for a while... cant wait!
B005GVF95O|4.0|The app itself is good. I agree that if this is for the sub-6 crowd that it should have the name of the animal, perhaps printed &amp; spoken, and perhaps a sound sample.  But I still prefer 'real' puzzles.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|I assume it is clear to the reader of this review that this book is supposed to be a continuation of Jane Austin's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Britain's celebrated and elderly mystery writer P.D. James.  This is not the type of book Austin would write - murder and mysteries were not her specialty.  But for James this is home territory.  Most of us who will read this book will do so because we want to know what happened to Jane Austin's famous characters.  Occasionally the writing has a phrase with an Austinonian ring but mostly it is apparent that this is not Jane's writing.  However, the mystery keeps you guessing to the end.  But I think the Austin characters are weak.  Our beloved and feisty Elizabeth holds her tongue too much - those silences don't seem like her. She is quite boring.  And Darcy is tortured by self doubt.  It is an intriguing mystery but an unsatisfactory sequel if you are longing to see character development.  Make your own decision about reading it - if you want a mystery, this is a fairly good one.  And even if you don't you may be tempted by any book that uses Jane's famous cast.
0440244412|5.0|Now this book is what 'grand finales' should be.  I did not think anything could top book four for intensity.  Karen ratcheted it up ten fold.  Every emotion was rung for me by the time this book released me from its grip.<br /><br />The story arc begun in the first book was complete.  There were so many twists and threads, but they were all brought together nicely for an ending.<br /><br />I was so sad to leave the fever world behind, but I am glad to hear that there will be a spin off series and possibly more fever books.<br /><br />Highly recommend this read.
B005GVF95O|3.0|Format is off for my MID8024 tablet. Would of been nice for my granddaughter. I can finish the puzzles but I need to overlap the pieces to finish.
0439023513|5.0|This is by far the best book of the series. I thought the first book decent, and the second one downright irritating. But the ending of this book was close to perfect. The wide variety of reviews indicates just how strongly people feel about the ending of this series, and it was no doubt controversial, but for me, the ending made the story seem so much more real than the other books ever did. To me, that was the main problem with the other two books. But FINALLY we see that Katness is not perfect, that maybe not everyone loves her without fail, and that, again FINALLY, there can be characters with gray area! Finally! This is by far the best book of the three.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I love puzzles! It doesn't take a lot of thought to master though it does require a foundation in the physical sciences. Teaches three dimensional spatial skills and the manipulation of kinetic forces. A great conversation piece on my fireplace mantle and will amuse and humble any guest that dares to take the Perplexus challenge. Great item for those that appreciate the simpler side of the now mega complex toy market.
B006IMY5ZU|2.0|Entertaining movie, only to be left with, WTF, ending.  Left with, Why did I watch this movie.  Save your money.  Wait for Netflix, or even a TV movie.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|Hollywood studios have new policies that prevent movie producers from offering seven figure deals to A-List stars.  This is due to overall declining revenue per film on average.  Therefore, in order to get A-List talent in a film, producers have created a new technique: offering A-List stars a few tens of thousands for a single day's work.  No script memorization - if you look for it in this film, you will notice that every A-List star is reading from off-scene queue cards or in-scene notes.  Very little or no wardrobe changes - often wearing their own clothes - which you can see here.  And, often, the film crew will come to the star and shoot wherever they are under any weather conditions, which you see in this film.  Often little or no makeup.  The stars usually never read the script and receive a Director's briefing a few minutes before their shoot.  The advantage is that you get lots and lots of A-List talent, which you see in this film.  The drawback is that you cannot weave your storyline around any one (or few) characters because you will only have them for a day or two.  Scripts have to be carefully crafted to optimize time and location.  This is one of those films, and you will see films like this more and more frequently as time goes on.  From other reviews here you can see the effects: the plot fails to be engaging because there are no characters we empathize with, and no character development because there is no time for it, and little over-arching story.  The stars are on the A-List for a reason, so we get the benefit of their outstanding performances, but they are never put in the position to have to stretch because there is no time for it.  With that said, and the complexity of shooting a multi-cast movie from day to day, I give this film's creators four stars.  The plot and plot devices are believable.  The death toll is horrendous, but is rational and believable based on past plagues.  The reactions of all the various players does not go outside thenorm of human behavior.  There are no heroes, saints, devils, evil people nor invincible warriors, and the resolution follows all the way through to a believable conclusion.  Due to the way this film was made, it could never be a box-office sensation, but it was made well for what it had to work with and you can bet highly profitable for the studio.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent app.  Easy to use and even easier to retreive stored information.  It really does what it says it can do.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Amazon doesn't list some important specifications so I'm just posting it here. I got them from the PBS website.  Length : 544 minutes on 3 Discs  Subtitles : Yes  Number of Programs : 9  Includes the Downton Abbey Christmas Special   As for season 2, it's pretty much more Downton Abbey. More Matthew/Mary, Mr. Bates/Anna, and more dastardly Miss O'Brien and Thomas. It's very interesting to see things start to change in the WW1 setting as well and some characters go through some big changes. The Christmas Special in particular is beautifully shot and makes me very excited for season 3 which has already been announced.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I absolutely love this album. The whole thing is soulful and full of emotion. Given her personal history you can really feel her emotions through her singing. I love really mellow music like this so this is the perfect album for me.
B0025KVLT2|4.0|It would be nice to see both UK and US versions released... either both versions on one disc - if they can fit -  or release it as a 2 disc set. Listeners could listen to what ever version they prefer.  Perhaps have the UK album in mono, and the Capitol one in stereo.  Just an idea, I know it's not going to happen!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Thanks amazon the product that I bought is in excellent condition,the only problem was that took too long to arrived, but I think it was because of the holidays... Thanks
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is one of the few books I have recommended with 5 stars before finishing.  Every page has been great.  I thank God every day that America has guys like Chris Kyle and the thousands and thousands of others who sacrifice for us.
B005GVF95O|5.0|I just installed this on my daughter's Acer Iconia - she is 3 yrs old.  I showed her where the icon was to launch it and she took it from there and is now sitting playing this game happily, all on her own.  Great GUI.  Easy for a young child to follow and the graphics are very well done.  If I had known about this app prior to today, I would've bought it.  If you are reading this review and it isn't the free app of the day - buy it, it is worth it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE THIS BIBLE SO EASY TO USE GETTING TO THE BOOK, CHAPTER  AND VERSE IS JUST A CLICK AWAY. AND HAVING THE OPTION TO USE DIFFERENT VERSIONS IS THE BEST
B004HYXW1O|5.0|It's brilliant!!! some of the most relatable music out there today. Great melodies and hooks, and extremely well written choruses. But above all else, it's just so completely HONEST & truthful!  I put this album on when i've had a rough day, and sometimes it can change my mind set by just hitting play.  Knowing someone out there is feeling what I'm feeling is a really nice reminder! Sometimes when your just stuck, and feel lost people need music that they can connect to and Science & Faith does just that. This album gives you heartache, loneliness, and hope all in one! If you are looking for real talent, great music, and a reminder that you aren't the only one out there, do yourself a favor and buy this album! Instead of listening to some auto-tuned junk, with a chorus that repeats over and over again, listen to Science & Faith an album that tells a story in just 12 tracks. The Script have summed up some crazy feelings into beautiful music, that I didn't even think could be summed up into words.  This album is incredible, and I can't wait to see what's more to come! Well done!  ~ Sarah
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addicting. I like how I can play for just a couple of minutes or as time allows I can play for an hour.
1610452607|4.0|This audio book is narrated by Simon Vance. Vance is known for his regal feel as a narrator, and replicates his performance for A Christmas Carol brilliantly, providing a slow, British accent to properly place the work of art. His narration gives the feeling of upper class.<br /><br />I have watched different interpretations of this classic period on the big screen. From ancient versions to the most recent production featuring Jim Carrey. This audiobook, by far, is superior to these eye-candy interpretations. Thus far, this is the best work I've heard from Simon Vance.<br /><br />Read more of the review and FTC disclosures at scriptedgenius(dot)com.
0486266885|3.0|Hands down, Stevenson's prose is special, however I would suggest if you are coming to this book in a later stage in life, you may want to bypass it, and study Frankenstein. It is a matter of relationships and character centers and themes too young in the former, which are quite similar really, yet more mature in the latter.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the Bible! And it is on my phone! And it's free!  What a great combination! If I could give it 6 stars, I just might!

B004VF68AQ|3.0|I've always been a bit of a stickler when it comes to choosing new albums to buy. How can I not be? With much greatness and more poorness in the world of music, a million new albums to choose from every month, I think we can all afford to be a little fussy here. In fact, I actually wasn't going to purchase the new janes addiction album. I've had too many disappointing experiences from similar kickass 90's rock acts, who release a new album 10+ years later, only to become number one on my useful paper weight albums chart. I love janes addiction, I just didn't know if I could let myself go through that kind of disappointment again....sorry.    Lets be realistic here, there's no way a band can keep churning out awe inspiring, high blazing rock n roll that will kick you in the nuts every time you listen to it. It's not natural, therefore its just not possible. It defies the laws of physics. So, if you're looking for a janes addiction album to match with the likes of 'Nothings Shocking' and 'Ritual De Lo Habitual' then don't bother. You're not going to find it here. There's just no where near the same rawness and aggression. However, if you've got a soft side for more catchy pop type sensibilities and modern day glossy production techniques, safely executed with precision timing (thankyou mr. computer) and tightly structured arrangements, then this album may be for you. I believe janes addiction have noted these important laws in the world of music and instead of trying to deny the inevitable they've turned it around and had a go a creating something a little new. Something a little more in-tune with where their heads maybe at. A smart move on their part!  There are some great moments on this album...'End to The Lies', 'Twisted Tale', 'Splash A Little Water On it, 'Broken People' are all worthy tracks. It's clear, a new sound is in the works. Synths, guitar lines of simplicity (hello! Dave Navarro!) and layers of ambiance are all thanks to the modern recording platformsand electronic sequencing which make this a very different janes addiction album. Maybe they've been listening to too much pink floyd?? One thing is true though, this is a very radio friendly album.        To wrap it all up, for me this albums like taking a mainstream rock band that you hate yet somehow always find yourself bobbing along too (think linkin park). The only difference is you want it to be successful, after all this is still janes addiction.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Love it, works well looks great. Needs more in-app customization and editing. Looks great on tablet/kindle fire. At least as good as pulse.
0688014291|4.0|GEN George Patton has been quoted as saying, \\"Don't tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and let<br />them surprise you with their results.\\"<br /><br />That premise nicely summarizes The One Minute Manager. Skilled, motivated employees need only be pointed in the right direction and management should be minimal. Communicate concisely what needs to be done in objective terms and get out of the way. Monitor the systems and give appropriate feedback only as needed.<br /><br />This book propounds the best way to accomplish this is by first writing out tasks and goals that can measured and reviewed quickly. Counsel, positive and negative, quickly and only in job-related terms. The One Minute part communicates keeping this to the point. Write goals, including the means to measure results, so they can be reviewed in about a minute. Especially at first, tell people what they are doing right and wrong as soon as possible to keep them on track. Most of the time, good managers will be in the background.<br /><br />It's so simple..... so why do we need a book? Too many folks don't do this! Failing to communicate tasks, give objective goals, failing to praise when warranted and waiting to reprimand until it's dumped out at an annual review is all too common.<br /><br />If you've ever been in the military you've certainly suffered this. How often did you stand around for formation (a team meeting in military-speak) to rehash things you already knew? Did you ever receive a written statement with goals/gates/tasks that were clear and measurable? Did you ever receive a written POSITIVE counseling statement for a great accomplishment? Did you deal with idiots that probably shouldn't be in the military but weren't removed because their leadership (boss) never bothered to formally reprimand and deal with them? If you can't honestly answer \\"yes\\" you're probably one of those that should have been kicked out!<br /><br />The One Minute Manager is a great management style for working with skilled people.
B006L1GNHQ|5.0|After about 5 days, my Kindle Fire is a new appendage. The first thing I aquired (after a couple of books) is a Season Pass to Once Upon A Time, having been hooked on this show since it started! I adore Amazon Instant Video and the fact I can download eps and store them or just watch them online. Admittedly, I generally watch on my PC because the screen is bigger. I'll be coveting one of those TV's on Amazon's \\"Watch on your TV\\" list too...<br /><br />As for this show - the stories are intriguing with creative twists on the (hopefully still) well known Grimm Fairy Tales. The character development is superb and the acting fantastic - Robert Carlyle is brilliant as Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold (yeah, I'm a member of Team Rumple - whadda ya gonna do?). That's not to say the other actors are not terrific too. Lana Parrilla as Evil Queen/Regina is over-the-top great and Jennifer Morrison plays Emma Swan wonderfully. Jared Gilmore who plays the 10 year old Henry is great too....as are all the other actors (Ruby ROCKS!).<br /><br />I haven't liked a show this much since the X-Files (before it jumped the shark). Speaking of coincidences.... Gillian Anderson (Scully in TXF) and Robert Carlyle were in a movie together: [[ASIN:B00197YZCW Mighty Celt, The]].<br /><br />With a season pass, no longer do I have to worry about missing a show and there are NO commercials!!! Worth EVERY penny, this purchase!!!!! I LOVE this show!!!
B0055SWM08|4.0|great fun for my kindle fire.  relaxing and challenging to get all perfect levels.  runs smooth on my fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty cool game. I really like the variety. this is great for use with the kindle fire.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|Not sure why this jumper got such bad reviews but my 1yr son loved it. I bought it for his 1st birthday party,<br />and all the kids loved it. First of all, it can hold at least 4 toddlers comfortably and after the party was over<br />I put in the house so my son can climb in and out as much as he pleases and it held the air in it for at least 4 months. After that I got tired of looking at it so I had my husband take it down. Also my 9yr also got in and out of it and the air stayed..so I love, love this product. Dont let the bad reviews scare you, this product is a must buy!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Unliike some other reviewers, I loved the book. It was worth every penny. One of the things a reviewer wrote was that Drew had no chance because of Piper's challenge to a duel. There would have been preparations and it would have been done in public. Anyways I loved this book. Altjough the  characters aren't perfect, the plot thickens in the second. believe me you won't be dissappointed with this series so far.
1419702238|5.0|Great book..my son has collected all editions..great price. most stores selling it for $16 so when  I saw it here for $8, I knew it would be a great stocking stuffer..this book is a must buy!

B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I brought this DVD for my daughter for Christmas. We had previously rented it and she fell in love with it. Since receiving it, we have watched it so many times that I am actually kind of sick of watching it but I do it to make her happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its just a challenging to figure out all of the puzzles. I recommend it for everyone either 13 or 103!
B0059XTTW8|4.0|The first thing that struck me watching this film set in the 1970s is how much it looked like a movie made in the 1970s. The replication of the look of a 70s film is an impressive and fairly subtle touch in settling the audience into the atmosphere of the film. The performances are top notch and it's a pleasure watching so many fine actors ply their craft so well. The difficulty of condensing a complex story into a two hour film, though, leaves viewers who are unfamiliar with the details of the story either because they have never read it or, in my case, read it so long ago as to remember nothing other than that is was good adrift a bit too much to be completely satisfied. But I doubt it could have been any better and still remained at a cineplex friendly length.
B004XGN8W4|3.0|I am just going to make this review a simple Pro and Con list, hopefully this will help anyone considering a purchase of the G155 system make a informed decision. I have been using it since December 28th.  Pro's  -It is as described, mostly. What you see in the pictures is what you are going to get. Though, they obviously needed to cut some corners to get the price at a reasonable $250.  -The speakers are surprisingly decent. It isn't going to blow away your home theater system, but they work well, even at max.  -The included mini HDMI cord is a big plus, since HDMI cords have had their prices extremely inflated over the years for no reason whatsoever other than to rip off consumers. I used to buy name brand HDMI cords for $10, now that same name brand costs over $50.  -It really is portable, as long as you have a power source. Even with a PS3 or Xbox 360 inside, it is very easy to carry around and the straps inside the case do a great job of holding your system in place.   Con's  -The screen is of low quality. This is a bargain screen. At a distance, it can look decent. However, playing it how it was meant to be played will result in a lot of shadowing, ghosting and jaggies. At first I didn't notice these problems, but the more I used it the more they became apparent. It is quite clear they didn't spend much on the screen. Will it do what it was meant to do? Sure, but it won't look great doing it. It is by no means a disaster, but it's far, far, far from great.  -The plastic used on the case is rather cheap. It is not a sturdy, hard plastic, and you can easily bend the entire thing. It always looks like it is ready to break. They used the cheapest plastic they could get away with and it shows. Do not buy this thinking it will protect your console. It won't. One small drop and this thing will shatter like a piece of glass.   -Although they say it supports the PS3 Slim, you will have to make the PS3 Slim actually fit. When the Xbox 360 or Xbox 360 Slim is in the case, it fits snugly and closes without a problem. However, when the PS3 Slim is in the case, and you properly adjust the included foam mat, the case will not close properly. I have tried this a million different ways, and followed their directions carefully, but the PS3 Slim sticks out a quarter of an inch too far, and you have to physically pull the top of the case forward and slam it shut in order for it to close properly with a PS3 Slim inside.   Overall, I am satisfied with the G155. It might seem like I am complaining about it more than anything, but the fact is I am enjoying it and for $250 it is a great investment. As long as you don't expect a AAA product with a AAA screen you will have fun with it. I plan on using a lot in the coming year, and I am glad I got it. Put your hype in order and turn the dial down to about 7 and you will find it does what it says it will do, for a decent price. It just could have done it all much better.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|Iv'e been playing Angry Birds ever since it all started on the iPod Touch. I enjoy to play angry birds over and over again on different devices. Since I just got a Kindle Fire for Christmas, I bought Angry Birds and loved it. If you don't mind ads I would reccomend Angry Birds free version just for money's sake. I would reccomend this app to anyone. 5 Stars &deg;&deg;&deg;&deg;&deg;
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was super cautious when buying this game online. My boyfriend had asked for Christmas for something that we could do together. He had mentioned that he wanted to play the game and that it sounded awesome. When I looked at it online I thought I was going to be bored out of my mind with it and that he would end up not liking it. Mind you I am the girl who was forced to play Risk because my brother needed another player to kill on the board. Game came in on time and he was ecstatic opening it on Christmas Day. We played that night, setting up the pieces and reading the rules. We have now played it 4 times, but wish it was more. We both LOVE the game. It is a great combination of Risk and Monopoly. Only thing I can think would make it better would be a small container to help roll the dice more properly. Since we haven't played it as much as we wanted to, for lack of a  third player, we bought the Rivals of Catan card game and hope to have it in soon so we can play more often. Also if you are looking for a great way to stir up the board game there is am Android App that randomizes your board for you! It has worked out great for us so far.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|A lot of apps on the app store are underrated, and this is no execption. This is a fun and easy to use app! I used to have the uno app on my Android and it looked too small but on the Kindle Fire it looks great and its easy to use. Last night I even played a full game of uno with my family and it worked great. Definatley worth 99 cents
B006PAZMMK|5.0|you can listen to this album over and over.  well done.  every song is different and  unique.  Has good flow.  worth the money.
B005J6LKVI|3.0|Distribution system worked as designed.  Item arrived on schedule and was in good condition.  The DVD was readable in the disk player.  The movie was insightful and thought provoking.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|different. games that you can have fun on a kindle fire...really cool got on htc phone too and is good
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game would have got higher stars if they lasted longer and the quality was better.overall a good time killer
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Freeze during game. I couldn't get it to pass first level without it needing to be force stopped. Please fix!
B0015DROBO|4.0|this was a good book but it kind of jumped around a lot abd was a bit confusing at first but other then that great book
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This was also a gift, but I got to listen to it. The shipping was also fast; as it always is. My father was able to get his gift on time and is so happy with it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a good game and I enjoy that that you can tap on a card and it'll move automatically, but I don't like that it doesn't always go where you want it to be. You should be able to tap on the card and tap where you want the card to go instead of dragging it. Other than that it's a good game.
1452101248|5.0|I love this cookbook and have already enjoyed making several of the recipes.  The vegetables are vibrant and slightly different and isn't that what we love in a cookbook.  It's great when you are staring at that acorn squash (or whatever) on your counter and can look at a new way to prepare it.  Inspiring, passionate and fun, this book is a pleasure to read and to follow.
B003YBUSMW|3.0|The wheel is well constructed, sits well on my lap, and feels good to use. However, I play Forza 4 and F1 '11 without TCS, ABS, and on sim steering; without force feedback this wheel is frustrating. If you turn all those assists on or want to play an arcade racer, it's an excellent wheel, but with them off you just can't tell when you're about to lose grip. I returned this one and upgraded to the $250 version of the same wheel with force feedback.<br /><br />TL;DR: This wheel is great for arcade racing, but without force feedback it's not good for sims.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|good but most of the time it beeps instead of playing your music and that beep is easily slept through!
B004DMIIO6|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting... but I enjoyed it.  It's a bit far-fetched and it's OBVIOUS that the actors are on wires for the \\"flying\\" stunts.  But it's a pretty good story line that is follow-able.  Makes for a good popcorn having Saturday afternoon flick.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|The tripod works well with my motorola bravo. It also fit a friends larger phone, but barely. The stand does not feel very sturdy and I don't think it will do well with a lot of man handling. But it's awesome if your using it to hold your phone for a long period of time, like at work or while watching movies.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Amazing. I've used this on the kindle fire and HTC rezound. So many features and a super clean intuitive interface.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|the games are great! the ad placement is horrible! on my tablet the ad bar hides the buttons needed to play the game and the constant ad pop ups are more than annoying! make a paid app without ads it'll be worth it!
1401907725|3.0|Was expecting A larger Book to come along with my cards, but its well worth the money. The only other thing that I wished for was better graphics. I do however LOVE my Cards and do not regret spending the money.
B006QANR5I|5.0|SPOILER ALERT:  Reading this review will not spoil your enjoyment of the Downton Abbey Christmas Special.  However, if you have not seen Series 1 and/or 2, there may be information here you would rather not know.<br /><br />The much anticipated Downton Abbey Special delivered the highlight of the UK Christmas TV viewing schedule in style. Viewers in the USA will have to wait a little longer. It has now been confirmed that this episode is included in the Series 2 DVD in the USA which is a real bonus!  There was plenty of action with the central plot featuring Mr Bates on trial for murder at a time when convicted murderers in England were often hanged and the impact of this on the Downton Abbey household above and below stairs. However, there was a good measure of dramatic sub plots featuring blackmail, romance, ambition and betrayal - in fact all the things one would expect from Downton!<br /><br />This was probably the best ever episode of Downton Abbey so should definitely not be missed.<br /><br />The timescale here took us from the end of 1919 into the beginning of 1920 so this will be the starting point for Season 3 which is scheduled for release later in 2012. Downton Abbey Series 1 attained critical acclaim and earned the series the title of the most popular UK costume drama since [[ASIN:B005GP7ELW Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition]] almost 30 years ago - given the number of such productions each year this is quite an accolade. Reviews for Series 2 were more mixed although I personally really enjoyed it, but few would have had much to complain about with this two hour special.  This hopefully has set the standard for Series 3 which we now know will include Shirley MacLaine. I can hardly wait to see her playing opposite Maggie Smith!<br /><br />This episode is included in the Series 2 North American release so if you have that DVD set, do not buy this too!
B00650SSWG|2.0|If you were 18 when the first Harry Potter movie came out (as Justin Timerlake's character claims to have been), you might be able to relate to this movie...if you are also emotionally shallow and think the world revolves around your feelings.  Otherwise, you will probably find it to be predictable, trite, slow-moving, and just plain silly.  Its only redeeming quality is that its overarching message focuses on the importance of starting romantic relationships as a strong friendship.    Oh, and be prepared to watch Kunis and Timberlake have sex about 500 times.  While both of these people are attractive enough, after awhile, it just gets plain tedious.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|The greatly anticipated second series of Downton Abbey picks up two years on from the first series in 1916, in the middle of World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen and the action covers the period from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. As in the first series, topical events of the period, political, economic and military are covered.<br /><br />The wartime scenario and the convalescent home setting provide an excellent background for some interesting story lines. The combination of excellent plot lines, great acting and the superb setting display all that is best in TV period drama. This time round we have eight more episodes to add to the seven in the first series. As befits wartime, the costumes are not as flamboyant as in the first series but they are thoroughly researched and appropriate to the period.<br /><br />There continue to be many superb individual performances but mention must be made of Maggie Smith. What a stroke of genius to cast her as Violet. She dominates every scene she appears in and often has some very funny lines.<br /><br />The UK has a long tradition of producing fine period dramas and this is the most successful since the early 1980s when [[ASIN:B005GP7ELW Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition]] took the world by storm. Peak viewing figures in the UK are 11m which is an astounding number for that market. It is pleasing to learn that a third series is already planned and we now know that this will cover an 18 month period from 1920 to 1921. This one is likely to run and run and I would not be surprised to see Downton Abbey continuing up to the 1930s eventually.

0307949486|5.0|I must admit that I hesitated reading Stieg Larsson's international phenomenon because of all the hoopla surrounding it.  Yet after being intrigued by the plotline and the recent movie trailer and on the advice of someone's trusted opinion, I decided finally to read it.  I was instantly sucked in to an intricately detailed and plotted thriller that made it impossible to put the book down even if the mystery at the core wasn't the most difficult to figure out.<br /><br />The story centers around two disparate characters.  Mikael Blomkvist is a finance journalist on the verge of a prison sentence for libel.  Just when he thinks all hope of recovering some shred of dignity in his professional life is lost, he is offered a unique job; he is hired by Henrik Vanger, the elderly ex-CEO of the Vanger Corporation to write a chronicle of his family's empire, but mostly to solve the mystery of his niece Harriet who went missing (presumed murdered by someone in the family) in 1966.  He is hesitant but cannot resist the remoteness of the situation or the money offered, plus as he delves into the family records, his journalist mind wraps itself around Harriet's story and will not let go.  When he makes a break in the almost 40 year old case, he turns to Lisbeth Salander, a master researcher and computer hacker, to help him out.  Salander is an unusual creature with a secret and disturbing past that has forced her to build walls around herself.  She and Blomkvist are an unlikely pair, but the draw of the mystery pulls them closer together, something that Salander is not sure she is capable of handling.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a compelling, intriguing, thoroughly engaging read.  Larsson certainly was a master at capturing detail and bringing vivid characters to life.  The mystery that consumes both Blomkvist and Salander is not a difficult mystery to solve, given certain natures of the case, at least for anyone who has read a lot of mysteries or thrillers.  Yet the way in which Larsson ties all of the loose ends together and the way his unlikely duo interact, make that slight disappointment with that aspect of the story forgiveable.  There assuredly hasn't been a more fascinating character than Lisbeth Salander created in recent fiction and the gruesome events that she endures and reigns over are compelling and exhilarating.  Just as I could hardly put this book down, I can hardly wait to read the next one in the trilogy.Larsson ties all of the loose ends together and the way his unlikely duo interact, make that slight disappointment with that aspect of the story forgiveable.

B004U52VPS|5.0|With Angry Birds being the hottest electronic game around, I thought this would be a great way for all 3 of the kids to play it together!  They love this game and play it for hours, making up their own rules and structures too!  It's fun for any age.

B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie was so boring it put me to sleep.  When I go to see a contastraphy movie I expect panic, there was a thin amount of panic once in a while, but for the most part it was all scientific with citizen's waiting it out at home. There were a few good parts where the young woman inoculated herself, and then went out of her way to infect herself, the prom dance, and the kidnapping. I am pretty sure that what I viewed about the politics within the world's governments and the health departments was right on target. But when I go to see a movie, or in this case rent one, I want to be removed from normalcy, and moved into fantasy for that short while, this did not fulfill that need. It left me wanting more.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Great little app well worth purchase.  Lots of stickers and stamps and colors.  My kids literally play with it for hours and send me their pictures via email to use as desktop backgrounds on my PC at work.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The app is great, it's practical uses are limited, overall it's fun to have. There are a few features I would like to see in future updates. Well made app, definitely worth a try.
1439102813|5.0|My mother has Alzheimer's and I am her primary caregiver. I have seen many of the behaviors identified in this book manifesting themselves in my mother's world. I have found this book to be so helpful in putting myself into my mother's shoes. I sent a copy of it to all my siblings in the hopes that, when they come and visit, they have a bit clearer understanding of what is and, more importantly, isn't happening in her brain. They are often disturbed or disheartened by the changes in her since their last visit. This book will help them walk through the process and associated changes with which those of us who are with her daily have become so familiar.   The book is well written, well thought out and provides a great deal of insight into the horrible, destructive nature of the disease. Alzheimer's is not for the weak or faint of heart. I highly recommend this book to anyone confronting Alzheimer's, but don't get to thinking that every time you forget something you have early onset Alzheimer's!!! At least I hope that's the right advice. I can't remember....
B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|I thought the deleted scenes would be included in the continuous movie. They are not. You have to go to bonus features to watch the deleted scenes.

If you monitor through the built in headphone jack the analog quality  is good so its happening in the conversion somewhere. bad drivers may be. too bad. had to return. i think the simplest way is to use an old deck and simply run to audio in in PC. Audacity, the software it comes with, is free online BTW.

0439023521|4.0|Loved the Hunger Games!! I could not put it down, read all three books in three days.   I really enjoyed the concept of the Games, and at the same time was repulsed by the idea of making children slaughter each other. It was really interesting as i was torn between those feelings throughout the book.   I found Katniss to be a strong character, although perhaps a little too humble sometimes.   I really liked the way it was written, easy to read, fast paced, but with enough detail to fill out the characters and setting.   Overall I loved it!! If you're a Harry Potter or Twilight fan, you'll be a fan of the Hunger Games.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I initially have rated at 3 stars, but have upgraded to 4.  See update comments  This is our second Verso Artist Cities, Red.  Wife wanted a Kindle Touch.  I bought from Amazon and a matching Verso Artist from a local store.  No problem with this cover.  Was picked over a dozen or so others as maybe the best looking cover on the market.  Wife saw a Fire so back went the unopened Kindle Touch and returned the cover.  Ordered the Fire from Amazon, but everyone sold out of the Verso Artist for Fire, so had to come back and order it from Amazon also.  I must say, the initial purchase, return, and re-order all handled very well by Amazon - couldn't ask for better.  Poor fit, reported by some others was not an issue. The Fire fit snugly in the elastic corners.  Some others reported the cover wouldn't close, but the packing piece inside the cover was thinner than the fire, so it compressed in shipping.  All it took was a little pulling and squaring of the hinge area and in about 10 seconds, PERFECT! Lies flat and looks like a leather bound book.  Just what we wanted.  Now here's why it's not a 5 star.  The manufacturing, petroleum smell a few others reported was not in the one for the Touch I bought locally so I thought maybe there were just a few affected.  However, it was quite strong in this one.  I'm guessing the manufacture shortcut the washing or neutralizing process to meet demand, because most of the reviews reporting this smell are fairly recent.  Absolutely love the looks and feel, but if you're sensitive to such smells, you may wish to choose another product, buy locally so you can check for smell first, or be prepared to return.  We will probly keep for the looks and plan to set out in the sun every day for a week in hopes of vaporizing the smell.  We're at day one and can already tell a little difference.  It's a very classy cover so we think well worth the effort.  Update:  I downgraded this item due to it's strong chemical smell, but planned to expose it tosun and outside air, pretty confident that the smell would fade.  It did just that.  After about 3 days on my dashboard in the sun, most of the smell was gone.  It's not noticable in use and doesn't seem to transfer to one's hands as it initially did.  Can still smell if you press your nose to it but hopefully that will fade over time.  Given the temporary nature of the chemical odor, I might upgrade to 4 stars, but can't give 5 because I feel this is a quality control issue with which customers should not have to deal.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow. I was a little hesitant to begin reading this book but now I am so glad I did! Suzanne Collins captures the emotions of her characters unlike any author I have read before. The way you're kept hanging throughout the book makes this novel a real page turner... and sequel buyer. If you enjoy Sci-Fi, Romance, Action, Drama- this book is for you!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|An amazing book.  An entertaining, compelling tale, rich in words and character.  Best part: once you've been captured by the story, you then realize that this book has meaning on different levels.  I have to go back and re-read to figure out what I missed.  The Night Circus is a book that is worth reading more than once, my highest compliment.

0385534639|5.0|What a totally brilliant story.  It's clever and fun and engaging and full of symbolism and really, really weird.  It tells the story of the magic that is 'reading a book' - the magic of the physical world falling away while the imaginary world comes to life in impossible, beautiful, demanding ways.  All of this is done through a metaphor of a circus that appears magically one day, opens only at night, and is the play-ground of two magicians trying to outdo each other in a non-antagonistic, but competitive way.  (It took me a while to figure out the metaphor.  I'll have to do a little googling to see if there are other interpretations).  Add to that that the magicians are under a compulsion to compete and are bound to each other in several different (including romantic) ways.  Add to that the magicians' non-aging, non-helpful teachers who put them under the compulsion to compete for unknown reasons and show up at times to add confusion rather than clarity to what is going on.  Add to that a clock-maker, a tarot reader, several sets of twins, and a half-dozen other interesting characters that all get caught up in the circus and the competition.  Add to that a dead average boy with no special powers, but hope and imagination, and no ties to the circus.  But none of these characters are the protagonist (I'd say they swap off taking turns - with equal page time).  If there is a true protag, it's the circus itself.  And the story isn't entirely linear.  The time jumps ALL over the place, but eventually settles into two basic timelines.  I started to think of it as two trains one track.  One train started in Miami at 100 miles an hour.  A second train started in Washing D.C. at 25 miles an hour.  Both are heading to NYC.  The climax of the story is where they meet at the same time / place.  (There were times this was confusing.  I had a hard time remembering where I was in time (at times), but overall it was really neat and the tension at the end when I knew we were hoursfrom the trains crashing was wonderful!).  And the cleverness of the story telling...  I could go on and on (although the moment it became a `three ring circus' was one of my favorites).  And the symbolism.  And the characters.  This isn't a book that was written.  It was crafted.  There isn't a scene that doesn't pull its weight.  There isn't a word out of place.    However, I will say that it took me a while to really get into it (perhaps what I had to get past were my expectation of a regular, linear, character-driven story), and I don't particularly see it as YA.  The majority of the characters are adults, and I'm not seeing any themes, etc. that says YA over mainstream (or fantasy).  Still, it's the best thing I've read in a while.

B005LJK3AC|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever (partially) seen. I tried to watch it all, but, I opted to have my hair set on fire and the flames put out with an ice pick -it was less painful.   None of the\\" bosses\\" were believable, though Kevin Spacey at least gave a convincing performance; meaning he appeared to believe he was the character he was portraying. The sexually harassing dentist is least believable of all. Jennifer Aniston must have decided she hadn't done enough to change (shatter) her image in \\"The Good Girl,\\" so she chose this role. She's so unconvincingly over-the-top that you keep expecting someone to say, \\"Live from New York! It's Saturday Night!\\" And her constant gentilian references and remarks are JUST PLAIN STUPID. Eventually, they reach a point where you have a difficult decision to make: was the writer not accomplishing trying to be outrageously funny, or is this their own perverse fantasy?   Hopeful as I was that things would improve they didn't, and I couldn't stand to see any more of the movie. The screenplay must have originated in a high school creative writing class; or locker room. If it appeals to you, you are likely either newly pubescent or truly young at heart -perhaps in a pathological way. The concept could have worked, but the writer was not capable of making that happen. Probably couldn't concentrate; too many guys snapping towels in the locker room. Stay sweet. Hope to have you in a few classes next year. Most of all, don't watch this movie.

B000002J6H|5.0|I feel sorry for Stephen Stills.  Apparently the only creature interested in hearing his wonderful music was the plastic pink giraffe on the album cover!  Well don't let that giraffe fool you- the guy has millions of fans, and don't let the guitar he's holding fool you either- there's a LOT more going on here than just acoustic guitar-based music.  \\"Do For the Others\\" features a softly sung, feel-good type 70's vocal melody reminiscent of... dun dun dun!  The one and only Crosby, Stills and Nash.  The lyrics are honest in a way that reveals Stephen Stills expressing his feelings in a relatively somber kind of way.  Now I went into \\"Church (Part of Someone)\\" totally preparing myself for the religious experience of a lifetime, and... not quite.  It's a piano-based gospel ballad with a female chorus.  Again, the noticeable aspect of pure honesty is hard to ignore, and probably what makes the song so appealing.  I admire it.  \\"Old Times Good Times\\" (not QUITE the Led Zeppelin song, har har!) is basically just a catchy rocker with an EXCELLENT guitar and organ jam at the end.  Wait, is that Jimi Hendrix on guitar?  Can that be true?  Good stuff there!  \\"Go Back Home\\" stands out for being the heaviest song here.  It's a blues rocker with a REALLY good verse melody and melodic guitar soloing.  The guitar jam at the end is great, but not before the melody switches up somewhere around the 3-minute point.  \\"Sit Yourself Down\\" and read my review!  Er... more like sit down and appreciate a song with meaningful lyrics and balladry vocals enhanced by a gospel choir.  \\"To a Flame\\" reminds me of Neil Young with the haunting vocals.  It's a dramatic ballad similar to the early work of Neil Young.  How Stephen Stills somehow morphs his voice into Neil's is a deep dark secret... or perhaps totally unintentional!  \\"Black Queen\\" features a hoarse voice by Stephen Stills, and the song is based around acoustic blues- a style of music I'm learning to appreciate ever since I acquired Hot Tuna's self-titled debut.  I like the way Stephen soars his voice during the second half while continuing to wail away on his acoustic guitar.  A highlight.  \\"Cherokee\\" is an experiment of some kind- it features a wide variety of musical instruments such as flutes, saxophones, heavy electric guitar, and of course, a vocal melody.  There's some other weird instrument that sounds like a sitar dominating a good portion of it, but I have no earthly idea what it is.  I bet someone out there knows and wouldn't mind filling me in on what it's called (hint hint!) Honestly the vocals get lost in the mix because everything *else* is pretty upfront and chaotic.  I wasn't expecting anything like this.  I went in expecting a peaceful mellow type song.  Nope!  \\"We Are Not Helpless\\" (you're darn right we're not!) is a tender ballad that makes me wonder if Loggins & Messina were listening to this song carefully because it sounds similar to their \\"Danny's Song\\" hit.  After a few minutes, the tempo picks up and becomes a piano-based gospel rocker.  Admirable.  Oh my goodness!  I completely forgot to mention the most popular song, haha!  The grandest song of them all as far as gospel creating an enormous, worldly feeling of bliss is concerned.  \\"Love the One You're With!\\"  I always thought it contained the ultimate lyrics for those struggling to keep a relationship togehter.  You know, a man wants to cheat on his wife but he'd feel guilty about it so... just love the one you're with, haha.  Me and my silly interpretations!  Overall, a quality debut.  Actually it's better than that.  It's terrific!  I highly recommend it.

B000002I6X|5.0|Stephen Stills 2 is shocking to me for a couple reasons.  One, it's not really a folk-rock album like it's often tagged as, and two, it's *drastically* different from the debut.  On Stephen Stills' first album, it was all about the gospel and blues arrangements.  Here?  It's more about implementing a variety of things.  \\"Change Partners\\" has a country vibe thanks to the guitar work, but truth be told it's more like a lively and upbeat pop song, and a darn good one at that.  Extremely catchy verse and chorus.  It's a winner.  A CLEAR winner.  \\"Nothin' to Do But Today\\" is very different, so begins the diversity I was telling you about.  I love this song just as much as the opener, but it's mainly the funky rhythm and catchy vocals that carry the entire song.  It doesn't NEED anything else either.  Now the next song titled \\"Fishes & Scorpions\\" includes the kind of vocal melody that I always wanted Stephen Stills to implement because this kind of enchantingly beautiful vocal style just feels so natural for his voice.  The guitar solo is borderline space rock, which is surprising.  Strange song, but a highlight.  Seriously, these first three songs are *awesome*.  \\"Sugar Babe\\" has a super positive message in the lush and cheesy lyrics, and that's only a minor distraction (even though I COULD complain about the chorus sounding lazily written, but... it's memorable so I'll leave it alone).  The lyrics about the turtles though... UGH!  Too much cheese, haha!  \\"Know You Got to Run\\" has a banjo in the intro, *again* featuring more diverse songwriting arrangements, and the atmosphere contains a subtle western vibe (western as in, cowboys and ghost towns!)  Everything about the song is pretty basic, but it's not bad.  Bad would be what happened on Manassas.    \\"Open Street\\" is the most diversely written song here.  I feel confident about this.  A bouncy verse melody with a gospel-like atmosphere.  Yes the gospel influence from Stills' first album is back again!  The handclaps are a nice addition, but... I'm just getting started explaining what makes this song much different from the other ones!  The brass section is sort of unnecessary, but it's short at least, however the most surprising part is the piano jam.  It's awkward because it sounds off in a few spots, and yet, it's melodic so I don't care.  I truly can't say whether it's an unprofessional way of playing the piano or not.  I just don't know.  In that respect, this song reminds me of David Bowie's \\"Aladdin Sane\\".  The bongos at the end are a nice finishing touch.  \\"Singin' Call\\" is a mellow country-ish song reminiscent of Crosby, Stills & Nash, and the atmosphere is lovely.  \\"Word Game\\" is the most \\"What the heck is THIS?\\" moment on the entire album.  It's nothing but a straight forward folk song with extremely angry and forceful lyrics pertaining to... I believe pertaining to a variety of things such as the homeless, and a direct stab at those who are quick to make judgements on other people.  Even though the song is based around the acoustic guitar and the melody is delivered in a fairly simplistic way, the focus here is most definitely on the lyrics.  It's hard to keep up with them (especially near the end when Stephen Stills just goes totally nuts) but this proves without a doubt that Steven Stills is a fantastic lyric writer.  \\"Ecology Song\\" is the albums weak point.  It's too brass-heavy and the additional vocals in between the main verse feel clumsily slapped together.  It's growing on me though.  The lyrics are pretty enjoyable and honest.  \\"Marianne\\" is some kind of throwback to the 50's with a SPLENDID and very catchy vocal melody.  I really don't know if this is a cover song or what.  I *think* it is, but whoever did the original, I haven't a clue.  The album finishes on a wonderful note with \\"Bluebird Revisted\\".  This song has the best vocal melody on the entire album, and feels like an exciting folk song to me.  Awesome.  Stephen Stills 2 is incredible.  A must own.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|I had high expectations for this game and when I played it, it was just like any other pinball game. I was dissapointed because I gad become tired and sick of this game after only two trys. I would probably not reccomend this game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app!!!!!!!!!!!!! bigot it on my kindle fire and cant stop!!!!!!!!!!! ive beaten every level of every single box!!!!!!!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I love the Mission Impossible franchise! All of the movies, with the exception of the 2nd one, have been fantastic. Before I saw Ghost Protocol, my favorite was the first one (1996). Of course now I've decided that Ghost Protocol is my favorite.   I had heard prior to seeing the movie, that they were wanting to go back to a team-centric story that the original tv series had followed. This film certainly delivered in that area. The team was well-rounded and the writers/directors allowed you to get to know the team a bit better than in the previous films. They also were preparing Jeremy Renner (Brandt) to eventually take over the Mission Impossible for whenever Tom Cruise decides to leave the franchise. While I am partial to Tom Cruise, I have to admit that Jeremy Renner did a good job. He certainly looked as capable as Cruise in the fighting scenes, and I have a feeling that Ethan Hunt will impart some of his confidence and craziness to Brandt before retiring.  All that to say, if you haven't seen this movie yet then go see it. You don't want to miss out on this newest adventure with legendary spy, Ethan Hunt.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift but decided to give it to my daughter two weeks early so she could enjoy it.  She was very pleased.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I would love to have this game on the Xbox 360 just like the original Fruit Ninja.  I hope they will release more levels soon.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to attend one of Adele's concerts this past year and it was an absolutely amazing experience. When it was over, I was so bummed that I wouldn't be able to have the same experience until she toured again. Luckily, they made this DVD and watching this is like being right back at the concert. It's an exact replica of what it would be like to be in the audience. So whether you have been lucky enough to go to one of her concerts already and want to relive the experience, or you want to see what one of her concerts would be like, this is the perfect DVD for you!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This series was perfect. My husband has to wake up early for work and most of the time misses some new episodes. Received the package  quickly and was in great condition.

B004DTLK8A|5.0|An amazing, beautiful album by Stratovarius, filled with landscapes and progressive elements all over the place. As we know, bass, drums and vocals are all being taken care of rather nicely, but the real rising star on the album is Matias Kupiainen and his incredible guitar playing. While he was not allowed to shine as much on Polaris, he comes full charge on Elysium and delivers some of the most brilliant guitar parts heard yet. ''Infernal Maze'' and the title track are two of the most amazing pieces of music ever heard from this band. To sum it up, give this release a listen, there is a high probability you'll find something on it you enjoy on it, whether you like power metal, virtuoso guitar playing, or both !!!
1451648537|3.0|a lot people's opinions and stories, but not a lot of Steve's thinking and religious beliefs and its effect. not a deep reading. but if about the history of Apple, it is a good reference.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I love the original Star Wars films, but these new blu-rays are filled with George Lucas' digital additions. All in all these additions really hurt the films. I was expecting to find the original versions on the blu-ray but unfortunately they do not exist in HD. What we are left with is an overabundance of extraneous digitally altered junk. These new additions do not look very good either. I could have looked past most of the newer additions but the ending of Return of the Jedi had me reeling in disbelief. Spoiler alert: Hayden Christensen pops up instead of Sebastian Shaw. I was so mad I turned the movie off before the credits could roll. George Lucas is a joke.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Tim Burton's effort was spectacular but nothing beats this Disney classic, especially for the little ones.  No one made animated films like Disney in their heyday & this DVD is no exception.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say?  Who doesn't know how amazing Adele is at this point or all of the accolades that this album has received?  So many great songs, whether they made the charts or not.  Song after song you just get drawn in to that gorgeous velvety voice.  If you haven't listened to Adele before, this is the album to get.
B004SRNH10|1.0|This is required for several of the apps my daughter wants on her tablet, but I downloaded the stupid program and it won't even attempt to open, much less make her apps work.

B005I64U5C|3.0|OK, I'm a Marvel guy, but I have respect for DC and their heroes. Hard to argue with their two mega stars Superman and Batman, but I like most of the heroes, Green Lantern being one of them, The Flash and the Atom being two more. This film is full of colorful special effects and Reynolds should be able to add some humor to this very complex origin, but the film just isn't much fun.<br /><br />The second half of the film does pick up a bit, but not enough to save this from being just better than average in the superhero genre. The three disc 3D/Blu Ray/DVD combo sports a nice transfer and some cool extras. I don't bother with digital copies, so I don't know anything about that...only what I've read which isn't very good.<br /><br />If you're a fan of GL, then you probably have seen this, but if you're looking to learn more about this hero, maybe one of his comic books would be a better bet.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Very entertaining and great concept - great story - well written and produced. A must see. It was so good - I'd watch it again.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|We had seen the \\"Making of Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\". and were anxious to see the final movie. Very well written and well produced. The \\"Creation\\" of the apes was fantastic - unbelievably real.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I will never get sick of watching this film!!  This movie brings back happy childhood memories and I will always be a big fan of The Lion King!! :)
0553805371|5.0|A great book thus far from what i have read. The title of my review sums up this book (at least two thirds of it). From the brief introduction, the book then transitions into a history of theories that have lead up to the ones we now have. It explains how the discoverers of such theories were at first thought of as crazy or opposing of God. Hawking explains the downfalls of not accepting such theories based on belief in god (even many of the scientists that made such theories, doubted at first their discovery because in their mind it seemed to doubt god), such is reason why so many religious believers and philosophical minds rated this book poorly. Scientific discoveries have indeed killed many philosophical beliefs of Aristotle and other such classical philosophers, and as bold as it may seem to religious believers, some laws of the universe have indeed pulled biblical stories into doubt. Great book for those interested in physics, philosophy, science, and religion.
1594744769|5.0|Like the photographs that populate this young adult fantasy, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is set in a world just slightly off-kilter from our own and a wonderful world it is. Jacob grew up listening to his grandfather's stories of Miss Peregrine's school and the children who lived there bolstered by photographs of the children and their special gifts. There was also a darker thread running through the stories of creatures that sought to kill the children and Jacob's grandfather. But time played its usual trick and leached magic from the world and Jacob is convinced that the stories were lies and the photographs clever fakes. His relationship with his grandfather has never been the same.<br /><br />Now Jacob's grandfather has died in peculiar circumstances and Jacob is convinced that seeking out Miss Peregrine's home will provide answers. Jacob saw something the night his grandfather died and no matter how he tries he can't dismiss the mystery. He convinces his father to take him to the remote isle where Miss Peregrine's Home once existed. Once there the mystery deepens and Jacob discovers more than he could have ever imagined.<br /><br />When I first saw Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children on the shelf I dismissed it as a marketing ploy, but something kept drawing me back to the book over several trips to the bookstore. How glad I am that I finally bought the book and read it. Something truly original is a rare beast and Miss Peregrine's Home is unique. Ransom Riggs is a lover of old photographs and old photographs inspired the story and the world of Miss Peregrine. A magical reading experience in a strange world. The ending promises sequels which I look forward to with impatience. Remarkable and good for all ages. Strongest recommendation possible.

0545265355|5.0|Wow!!  What an engrossing story!  You're drawn in from the beginning and then you can't wait to get to the finish - but you HAVE to see it through.  I have to say that I never thought that it would end this way, although I was very glad to see one or two matters taken of in the end (won't say what!) EXCELLENT READ!!  It's gritty, but worth it!

0439023513|1.0|I've never written a review on Amazon, but here goes.  How do I UN-READ this book??  I WAS the biggest fan of the first two. I saw the film trailer, then bought the audio version of Hunger Games to listen to on a ten hour trip.  I was hooked.  I ordered the second book, and read it in three days.  I've told everyone I know about the series, and was looking forward to giving them a second read; and of course watching the film.  Then I read this \\"mutt\\" of a book.  Wow!  The author completely killed any desire I had to re-live the journey with these characters.  Hopefully Lions Gate will write a new story for the Mockingjay film (if it ever gets this far), and give us a film that doesn't make us want to un-see the first two.  At this point, I'm not sure I'll be seeing Hunger Games anymore.  If the author's smart, she'll give us a fourth book in which Katniss wakes up, and all the events in Mockingjay were a bad dream.
076115728X|5.0|I saw this book while I as in a museum gift shop.  At the time, I passed it up, but eventually, I came to Amazon and bought my own copy.   Beautiful Oops is very cleverly put together.  It is whimsical and artistic. As a designer myself, I enjoyed it, as well as a few of my artistic friends.  It teaches that there is potential in everything--a valuable lesson, even for adults within and outside the creative profession.
B005ORVN1Y|2.0|Well, even though the whole sound and format of Signals has always been one of my favorite Rush albums, I have shared Alex's opinion about the guitar being in the back. So I just knew that this DVD audio would have been a sonic treasure (similar to the Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road DVD-A or any Porcupine Tree DVD-A). Instead we get and entire album of an alternate vocal take of every song. I'm sorry but all the little inflections, nuances and things that make a song (any song) special should not be fooled with. Was it just impossible to use the original vocal take? Of course I love the guitar mixed to the front a little more but not at the expense of what sounds like an album revisioned. Just saying.......
1419702238|5.0|I ordered the book as a Christmas gift and we have been very pleased with it.  It shipped in plenty of time for me to receive it by Christmas.  It also came in excellent condition.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are catchy, not really relaxing cause they are fast paced and challenging. Controls are kind of difficult to master, finger controls are touchy. Ad placement is God-awful, can barely play some of the games cause ads get in the way of finger controls. The graphics and resolution need some work. Definitely need to fix the ad problem for a better rating.

0451196716|5.0|I love this book.  Given an opportunity to make a list of top ten favorites of all time, this book would be on it.    Hey!  Wait a minute.  What am I talking about \\"given an opportunity...\\"???  I'm MoonDonkey!  Not some mere peasant that begs for alms from his master!  I need not wait for opportunity... I create opportunity!  Heck, I am opportunity!  Therefore, I bestow upon The Long Walk the great and honorable title of top ten MoonDonkey favorite.  If you find yourself blessed to walk in the shining light of this review, then you now know all you need to know.  MoonDonkey's blessing is like a light from heaven shining straight into the darkness of your skull and opening the eye of enlightenment.    I've read this book at least three times... perhaps four (during my long and productive immortal life).  I consider it one of Stephen King's best works.    What's that you say?  How can this be in the top ten all time if it is only \\"one of\\" King's best works?    Hey - I am large... I contain multitudes.  Additional King work's may be on the list as well.  All I'm saying is that The Long Walk is in the discussion.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game, especially considering that it's free. It looks great on my Kindle Fire and it's a nice way to burn some free time. Like others have said, some of the controls are a bit clunky, but it's more just something to adapt to than something that gets in the way of game play.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|One question - tell me what the alien looks like.  Seriously - what does it look like?  Draw a picture.  I can tell you what ET looks like.  I can tell you what Predator looks like.  I can tell you what the Alien from Aliens looks like.  Sooo... what the heck does this thing look like?  You can't.  We never get a good enough look at it to figure it out.  For that reason alone this movie sucks.  Period.  End of story.  However, it sucks for many other reasons as well.    What the heck is this movie anyway - some sort of mutant offspring of ET, Close Encounters, Cloverfield, and the Goonies?  Oh - except in the Goonies we actually had a group of kids that were likeable.  Not so here.  We get the chunky kid who is directing a Super 8 film - but he is rude, annoying, and entirely unlikeable.  We also have a thin crazy kid who likes fireworks.  He just comes off as a nut who is off his meds.  We also have a couple other young boys, none of which contribute anything to the film other than taking up space.    That leaves us with the young male protagonist (I forgot his name) and the young female protagonist (I forgot her name) and their puppy love story - except that we don't get anything from that either.  At least in Goonies there was a kiss.    This film follows the adventures of this worthless band of kids while an alien is loose somewhere in their town.  The dumb thing is that the kids really have no impact or relevance to anything that is happening.  What do they accomplish?  Do they help the alien?  No.  Do they hinder the alien?  No.  Do they do anything at all that impacts what the alien is doing?  No.  They have no purpose whatsoever.  What is the alien up to?  Well, that is hard to say exactly.  The alien digs himself (?) a cavern under the town's water tower and uses a bunch of local machinery to turn the tower into some sort of giant electro-magnet or something.  Apparently, the point of this exercise was to attract thousands of tiny \\"alien looking\\" cubes (about the size of Rubik's cubes).  You see - the alien ship was made out of a fancy alien alloy that converts into these little cubes.  One minute the ship has form, the next minute it becomes thousands of little cubes.  The how and why isn't important... just go with it.    Ok - so I can live with that.  However, how the cubes are handled must be one of the dumbest moves in the history of alien containment programs.  When the government decides to move the alien cross country in a train, they put all the cubes into crates on the same train.  Why?    Then, at the end of the film when the alien is using the magnetic water tower to collect metal and such, where are the cubes?  Parked in a series of trucks across the street!  Wow... it's like the most convenient plot twist in the history of film.  What is the range of the magnetic water tower?  Guess that doesn't matter because the government parked the cubes right across the street!  Lucky break for the alien because then the cubes all fly up into the air and re-create the alien ship - which then takes off like something from The Last Starfighter.    To add to my list of gripes - what was the alien trying to accomplish anyway?  If the little cubes had not been parked right across the street from the water tower, what would have been the point?  Let's say that the government had actually done something intelligent and had these cubes in a secret base somewhere for research.  What then?  What was the tower going to accomplish then?  In fact, I'd argue that the only way the plot makes any sense at all is if the alien knew the cubes would be within the range of the tower in the first place.  Otherwise, what is the alien doing except wasting time?    So the end result of this fiasco is that we have a bunch of kids that we don't care about chasing around an alien that we don't care about.  This is mixed in with some parents that we don't care about and some military leaders that we don't care about.  Super 8 only gets up to 2stars because I didn't turn it off.  1 star is reserved for movies that are total garbage and unwatchable.
0060873027|1.0|This book is really just a novelization of \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Scientists,\\" and I think the Rick Moranis version was much better. Terrible writing, not at all engaging, overly-gross descriptions of death-by-bug, and very unlikable characters. Personally, I wanted all the little whiners to die. I have to believe that Michael Crichton wasn't really responsible for most of the writing; it certainly doesn't seem much like his style. He should be glad he's not here to read the bad reviews, and his publishers should be ashamed of themselves for printing this dreck in his name.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I don't have the words to describe just how awful this is. Sounds more like some kind of Saturday Night Live joke than an actual \\"serious\\" recording. I've been a casual fan of both Metallica and Lou Reed and thought this would be interesting - maybe bring out the best in both artists. WRONG! Metallica's playing is decent enough. It's Reed's robotic, monotone, sing/speak that drags this down to an unbearable experience. I've never heard such inane lyrics in my entire life. You listen to this and shake your head, how could someone have green-lighted this project? And one disc wasn't enough, this turd is 2 discs long! Simply, unbelievably BAD!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book truly opened my eyes to all the training the Navy Seals go through.  I felt like Marcus was just sitting in a chair telling me this story.  I feel for the families of the 3 who were killed, but they went in there and took out a bunch of terrorists.  Thank you God for these truly wonderful men.  It was so amazing the people who were at his parent's home while waiting to hear whether or not he was alive.  His twin just knew he was.  Thank you for the village that took him in and the man who made it to the base to let them know he was alive.  A big thank you for the seals and others who went back into that area to bring our guys home.  God Bless the Navy Seals and the entire military.  Brave people fighting for our freedom.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I have owned this movie for a long while now and have viewed it many times.  With each viewing I appreciated this movie more for it's 'originality', as a whole new way to look at our beloved Sherlock Holmes; the word here is 'origin'.<br /><br />I had lent my viewpoint of the super sleuth from the portrayal of him by Basil Rathbone.  Watching movie after movie of Sherlock and Watson over the years done in such a way, I had just taken for granted that this is the way our detective was written also. While studying, the movie really made me wonder; how was Doyle's original interpretation written?  So I went in to crack the books a bit.  I had formed an opinion based on a screen performance through time that isn't altogether correct.<br /><br />Doyle's books bring to light a multi-layered Sherlock Holmes that would go into the future and not become anything stodgy limited to just one time period.  He is actually an everyman, and one who is steeped in all the knowledge that Guy Ritchie introduced to the audience in this action packed film. I am sure many of us found the Sherlock that we thought we knew to be a polar opposite of the man we see here, although this is Doyle's man of Baker Street.  Guy Ritchie did a brilliant job portraying his lead, Robert Downey Jr., as Holmes and gave Jude Law a new well rounded Watson for us all to see for the first time.<br /><br />The movie itself hails the duo to be a new \\"reintroduced\\" vision and in part that is true. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" brings to life Doyle's original writing of the books and is far more closely related to this screen adaptation, in my judgment, from studying.  What an awesome surprise for me. Everyone who has read any of the books and/or only has seen the different screen adaptations, keeping those portrayals to reflect the scope of Holmes alone; you must do your imagination a huge favor and introduce Ritchie's everyman super sleuth to yourself again.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is so faceted with tons of nuances shown here in this movie from the novels.  He is so many things all rolled up in one man of action and completely cerebral throughout, a man of then and a man for now.  He is steeped in many realms of thinking, as he is also just as much a defender of those truths.  A bare knuckle fighter and well versed in the martial arts, Doyle wrote him extremely well rounded to be a thinking man of adventure.<br /><br />Sherlock and Watson explode into this movie, using every trick in the books and show us a very real and exciting duo.  Now that I know how these characters were originally written, I can clearly see that this is an important movie setting the standard back to the original.<br /><br />I have already seen the second film and thought it far reaching because I didn't do my homework ahead of viewing it. Now I can hugely appreciate this movie as definitely I will watch my judgment of things without knowing the facts first. If you enjoyed this movie as I did, you're in for a real treat with viewing the second film. It is as if you are getting the same Holmes and Watson here plus adding so very much more.<br /><br />Enjoy the first movie again, perhaps before viewing the second. It is worth a second look with a new perspective and refreshed open mind.n here in this movie from the novels.

B004FEJ3VY|5.0|My 5 year old grandson wanted transformers for Christmas. He got quite a few but this one was the most difficult. I set about transforming it into a truck. Fortunately for me, I'm good with puzzles because the instructions were almost useless. Full color instructions would be very helpful. At one point, I had to manhandle one part to accept another. After that, I could finish it. I think it's going to be too difficult for my grandson for awhile. I can imagine that if he was working on it with an older kid around who has experience, he'd be inspired to work it out. He definitely is into transformers though.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I love mahjong and this one plays fine EXEPT!!! it kicks you out for no $!@# reason. Find a fix before I delete it. Not happy!!!
1451648537|5.0|This book was listed as used, but it's in basically perfect condition. It arrived within a few days, and the price was less than half of retail (especially great that it's hardback). The money I saved ordering here was worth waiting a few days to receive it, as opposed to paying much more at a bookstore. I can't wait to read it - RIP Steve!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so nice to have my Bible at my fingertips! enjoy the highlighting capabilities and the reading plans to help me stay in the Word.
B005869U6G|5.0|I have been an Incubus fan for years and waited on buying this album because of all of the negative reviews. I wish I had bought it earlier. It is different but still good. It does not have as much angst as their other albums. I really like it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good games, most are really simple. some can get boring. only a few games are able to be played at first, rest have to be unlocked.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|EDIT:  Please add another map with a different game mode!<br /><br />The default touch controls work well and they're easier to control compared to other racing games like Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and Riptide GP (which are also two other great looking titles).<br /><br />The combination of short races and buying/selling/smuggling commodities to come up with a final score isn't completely new but I haven't seen anything like it for a long while.  It is very well executed.  The graphics are beautiful (default setting is not at the highest, so make sure to go into settings and fix that) and many objects can be destroyed in this game.  The gameplay is relatively easy but very addicting.<br /><br />The real negative is that there isn't much diversity in tracks and there doesn't seem to be any other game modes.  A normal race mode requiring several laps with boosts and other buffs would just knock this game out of the ballpark.  Still, this is a well designed game that's easy to play and has decent replay value.<br /><br />It's nice to see a developer actually try to push the limits of newer devices like the Kindle Fire instead of rehashing decade old WMP 2003 or old PC flash titles for a quick buck.  And you can tell, a lot of good, honest labor went into making this game.<br /><br />I paid $1.99 and I would buy this game again without hesitation.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  The whole family watched it and we all had a great laugh.  It was very enjoyable to watch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun app but I'm bad at most of the games and the ads are really annoying though. good.for a free app though
B0057EYACI|5.0|I would highly recommend this CD set to anyone wanting some good tunes.  With the bonus songs, this album is definately worthwhile and without question a thumbs up.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It just works. That's all I need.  Trackpad mode is handy since it's a little hard to hit smaller targets with your finger. Now able to waste more time playing stupid Facebook games. Highly recommend.
B005GVF95O|5.0|for all u who r complaining, just calm down its free so enjoy it before it id gone. btw this game is for young ones not u people so just calm ur little selves down!
1400077915|5.0|When I read stories by Alice Munro, I feel as if her characters, who mostly live what one might call ordinary lives, represent the whole range of human emotions.  Often, women in the stories in \\"Runaway\\" contemplate their possibilities. Sometimes they take a chance, sometimes they don't, but the things that happen are never ordinary. In fact, a word like \\"ordinary\\" is better reserved for the plentiful  light escapist fiction that you can finish and cast aside, knowing it has nothing to do with anything real. You won't feel that way about anything Munro writes.<br /><br />M. Feldman
B00005O3VC|4.0|I ordered MPHG in blu-ray format LAST MAY and it still hasn't shipped.  Does ANYBODY out there know why this title was advertised for sale nearly one year ago but still isn't available??  4 stars just because I had to rate to ask the question. I WANT MY HOLY GRAIL...............IN BLU-RAY.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Have used other remote acess packages with absolutely no problem estabishing a connection with my remote PC's.  This app, on the other hand, is hopeless.  Started with the most basic automatic setup (Internet Disovery) and all I get are \\"Connection Failed\\" errors.  Tried connecting to a local PC over WiFi, a remote PC over 4G, 3G and using a remote WiFi network, tried port forwarding and a manual connection using the IP address and port.  If it worked for others, they are lucky.  Got this for free so will reinstall at a later date to see if they improve this app.  If I had paid, would be looking for a refund!
B003B2C92G|5.0|Spawn is one of our Grandson's favorites. He watches it with his grampa even tho he is now twenty years old. They love the idea that someone who is wrongly accused and considered bad - gets the really bad guy in the end and succeeds in ending up good. Spawn is a scarry type movie with a good plot. I would recommend this to any sci-fi buff.
B001TODCII|5.0|Great movie! Lots of action, thrills, and suspense. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action movies. Liam Neeson is excellent in the role. Best line,\\" I don't have money, but what I do have are a special set of skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.\\"  So grab the popcorn and settle in for the ride!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple solitaire game to pass the time. Lots of excellent features including card/board background and 3 draw.  Ads aren't intrusive one bit.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Installed in seconds. Using it now. Best app I've downloaded to date. using it to stream video so I can check on my puppy.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Fast on home network  VERY HANDY  If program runs on PC, can see on my Kinde Fire although can be tough to be precise.  Shocked to see I could see what's on my 2nd monitor also.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love using this app for work and personal life! The fact that I can access my notes and notebooks from multiple.devices is amazing!
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Works as described. Seems to be sturdy and sounds good. Still need to use supplied software for ripping to pc.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble's CD is wonderful and provided us with the opportunity to give it as a holiday gift to several older relatives...it was perfect and very much appreciated...
B005K17RU0|5.0|I found Accuweather for Aneroid to be an easy load onto my Kindle Fire and a great weather app as usual. it loads quickly and is easy to read and navigate.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If you've listened to pop radio for no more than 15 minutes a day, you've heard a cut from Adele 21!  And for good reason; it's simply a great CD! Get it!  Enjoy; no problem.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was on my wish list for a few months, but I didn't purchase it until January 1.  I finished it on January 2.  As a child of the '80s, I enjoyed the nostalgia and seeing that decade from a different perspective.  The gaming sequences were definitely the strongest portions of this book.  Who would of thought that descriptions of cyberspace, a.k.a. OASIS, could be so riveting?  I'm looking forward to other books from this author.
B00008BLB8|5.0|When I was in college in the 70s, my roommate and I would slap this on the turntable, crank it up loud and just jam from start to finish.  The energy of the band in this live show is fantastic and the recording quality is about as good as I have ever heard of an arena rock concert.  I asked for (and got!) this on CD this past Christmas and can say the album still is breathtaking.  The band are extremely tight, have great vocals and demonstrate outstanding musicianship.  I wasn't a particular GFR fan back in college (or even now), but I still put this album very high on the island disk collection list.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this app is amazing. my friend myki has it on her nook Color. I looked for it on my kindlefire and reluctantly found it! I was super excited because I love to draw. I am in the process of purchasing this app because I am a teen and don't have my own account I use my moms, so every purchase has to be confirmed. I am super excites to buy this app and think it is.totally.worth it!

B004EPZ06G|4.0|This movie was pretty darn hilarious, but I think I enjoyed part one better. The monkey's definitely an integral part of this movie, but it's a little out there!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101 games rocks! I don't know how the heck they got those! If your looking at this right now and your wondering to upload this do IT!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Great remote app. If it was on a better device than the Kindle Fire, it would be a 5 star.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loved it is so much fun almost beat all levels like the fishes love it love it love it love it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it has so many options to choose from. I love this game. This game is awesome!!  It is so much fun!!!
B0053YEM7U|2.0|Thank God I chose to download an MP3 version of this album, which cost me $5 instead of $13+. Drama was my least favorite Yes album to date. Although I really like Squire's vocals, that album lacked creativity and it was melodically weak. Well, they managed to surpass that with Fly From Here. Over the years Yes has in some ways transformed themselves. When 90125 was released, it did not have any 20+ minute long track but it did not have to have one. It was a different Yes in many ways, a more mainstream band playing pop/catchy tunes and it worked. Then for some reason years later they decided to get back to their roots and write long songs again. That's fine but unfortunately they haven't been able to compose anything close to Tales or Close to the Edge. The opening of Fly from Here (Overture) is a 5-piece composition stitched together. The result is agonizing. The lead singer shows no energy and his voice is absolutely horrible. The album probably would have sound much more appealing with Squire on vocals. The keyboard is pathetic (Tony Kaye could do better) and I don't understand why they did not invite Igor to join the band. IMO, he was the best keyboardist the band ever had aside from Wakeman. So, all in all, a very weak and difficult to listen to Yes album. If I had to buy it again I wouldn't. Not even for $5.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great app! Some games are hard and some are easy so it all works out. I think without haveimg to by other games it would be boreing.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This looks and works great on the Kindle Fire. I usually don't like to pay when I feel something should be free but I am glad I did. It syncs with Google calendar seamlessly and is easy to use. No regrets!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|It gets 5 stars because this is one of my favorite movies within my mobster movie collection... The transfer as in video was great.. but the audio is off by about 3 secs.. it';s really noticeable when the neighbour gets pistol whipped
0882709194|1.0|Darwin's version didn't include 50 pages of garbage... I mean \\"special introduction by Ray Comfort.\\" The forward contains creationist arguments against the theory of evolution that was most likely just ripped from Stan Guffey (a biologist at the Univ. of Tenn.)  Youtube Ray Comfort's banana video featuring Kirk Cameron. Prepare to have your mind blown.   Check out Comfort's Wikipedia page for more details.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|this is a very good movie it has been a long time since I seen the planet of the apes movie. I really can not add or say anything else that the other reviews have not already said about this movie. will watch it again well worth the money great price I've seen this in stores going for $20.00 or more I payed $14.99 on amazon great deal.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good for a quick no brained game when you just want to burn up time. controls could use a little work but maybe it is just the participant :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is amazing, I have used this app to access my portfolio for my photography biz when i am on the go and don't have my Kindle Fire handy.... I just whip out my phone pull up my portfolio that is stored on my pc and show it off!! I have also used it to stream my iTunes music library directly to my HTC G2!! Another good use I have found for this app is to run spotify from my desktop to my cellphone as well avoiding the monthly spotify charges for using your mobile to stream music! It's also fun to be able to access your PC games and play them on your phone (REEL DEAL SLOTS) and pick up where you left off while on break at work or waiting for the bus! I am waiting for the HD version of the app to be supported on my phone/Kindle and i will be upgrading to that version until then this app works just fine!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game its really fun one.of.the most exciting games on market........... its fantastic I highly rdccomend. 101 games-awesome peace out
B0054JZC6E|5.0|u should get this it is amazing I love all the games my fav. is prob ALL OF THEM that is y u should get it.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I listen to this cd every day I love it and it's so fun placing where the songs are in the movie
1400069181|5.0|I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this book. The only reason I picked it up was due to the simple fact that I love TOMS and the One for One Movement. It was a fantastic decision. This book was a very fast read, full of amazing entrepreneurial tips and stories of people around the world helping one another. I highly recommend this book. You'll set it down feeling fulfilled, inspired, and ready to start something that matters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun and addicting..u just have to have patience and skills lol only flaw is that the later games require way too much playing time to unlock
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is an easy time wasting game. It's fun to earn points and get new games. I like that there are many games available. Nothing spectacular.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|At first I was against getting the blu-ray Star Wars set, because like so many other fans, I object to George Lucas' tampering with a classic. At 25 I saw the original release in the theater when it opened in 1977. I got back in line and saw it again. I have attended opening day for each of the sequels/prequels. I bought them on vhs, and dvd upon release. I was so glad when the original theatrical releases were made available, and bought them too. So I finally gave in and got the blu-ray set. Wow! the picture quality is great! As I watched, I got all caught up in the story again, and didn't really care about the little changes. IT\\"S STAR WARS!!! I gave it 4 stars because I don't cars as much for the last 3, or first 3, whatever, (Prequels). I'm a fan, not a film-maker. I enjoy the saga for what it is. Every time The Beatles catalog is released I buy it again. Why? Because I'm a fan, and quality matters to me. When the original theatrical releases of Star Wars come out in blu-ray, I'll buy them again. I'm a Force-aholic, it is my destiny!
B005GVF95O|3.0|Good for a few minutes for the little one, but even at 3 he gets through all the puzzles in a few minutes.  with more puzzles it would be worth paying for, but 14 is too few.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Tested on XP and was able to access my work laptop screen from my phone while in meetings.  Obviously, it is highly dependent on your network connection speed for response.  The touching seemed imprecise but maybe that is just my fat fingers.  It is nice to use in a pinch but it is not something you want to use for an expended period of time: that is no fault of the application as it is more an issue with driving a computer with a phone keyboard.  Perhaps it would be nicer using a tablet.  I honestly would not have tried this app were it not for free-app-of-the-day.  I expected it to be displaying the phone screen to my PC.
B004G6009K|5.0|We absolutely love the movie. The humor and satire is on par with allowing the little ones to watch. Everyone has their own opinion on the shrek series and we don't really like the crude humor as much for the kids (4 and under). Our daughter loves this movie and as parents we enjoy the movie too. I highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has everything I need and more. I especially love the reading plans. There are many to choose from, as well as many versions. I highly recommend this app.
144234430X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Many people chastise King, saying it's not a \\"JFK book,\\" and I agree. It's not. For me, it's a love story. I found myself enthralled by the George Amberson's life in Jodie, especially his time with Sadie. This is where King's writing is strongest, and, at times, I felt as though he were forcing in the Oswald story. We, the reader, want George (or Jake) to wind up with Sadie, to take her back to 2011 and have her face completely healed by modern medical technology, but once King introduces that idea, we know it will never happen. And once Sadie accompanies George on his quest to stop Oswald, we know her fate is sealed.   What I do have a problem with is the ending. Would the world have been that cataclysmic had JFK not been assassinated? Also, call me a a sucker for happy endings, but I desperately wanted Sadie and Jake to be together at the end. For me, a \\"better,\\" ending would have been to have Sadie die as she did, but have Jake find the world better in 2011 than how he left it. Once Sadie dies, Jake is hellbent on returning to the past to \\"undo\\" her death, and once he finds out that 2011 is a wasteland, we're just waiting for Harry Dunning to shut up so he can go. I would have much rather seen Jake struggle between returning to 1958 to save Sadie or staying in the new and better 2011 to save...well...everyone else.
0439813786|4.0|This is a great book. It's not only for children. I received it for Christmas, and ripped through it (mainly because of all the pictures). It's a fantastic book for lovers of film, and also has a few silent movies listed in the back of the book, if anyone is interested. Read this!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|My daughter told me about it, I loved it.  I liked all the adventures that the crew  have. Throughout the movie you wait to see what else will happen. I like the comic relief then it gets back to being serious. A really good adventure movie.
B005ZCXFD2|3.0|a really good movie. I'd have given it three-and-a-half, but Amazon doesn't ALLOW IT. One of the one-star reviews says the plot is pointless. Really? That's silly, because the whole plot is about a gang trying to protect their block against an alien invasion. One of my favorite characters was Pest (his granny magnet shirt was funny), and I liked the two younger boys as well. Maybe the reason people didn't like this movie is because it's not the typical American alien film where there are explosions every two seconds and the aliens all look the same. I guess some people don't like change...
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a fun game, enjoyable by adults and children.  This is almost exactly like the Kinects game. I would recommend this game to everybody.
B005J7K964|5.0|I own this on VHS and was thrilled when it was released on Blu-Ray!!  I'm a sucker for cheese 80's rock and of course have several versions of the Fritz Lang Metropolis including the last two special editions.  To go back in time to see the origanl uncut version would be fantastic, but I will watch what is out there.  I digress, this version is a cool club mix.  Lace up your boogie roller skates and rock on.
B005SAP45I|5.0|I just wanted to see just how \\"atrocious\\" Cars 2 was. I loved Cars 2. Positive message about being yourself. Fun storyline and action. Designate politics to the adults? Children are our future, people. Storyline of Cars 2 too difficult for young children to comprehend? Well, so is the storyline of just about every other G Rated movie.<br />Every movie has some darkness in it. I mean if everything in the movie was happy, the movie would not be interesting.<br />I personally would watch Cars 2 over The Overrated Incredibles anytime.<br />I mean, it's not like Cars 2 is a scientific documentary, or is forcing anyone to agree with what it is trying to teach.
B000TJ6BB4|5.0|That CD is the definitive proof that The Bangles was the best all female rock band I've ever heard ! Should be in rock star gallery !
1439170916|5.0|Mukherjee writes, \\"Medicine begins with storytelling. Patients tell stories to describe illness; doctors tell stories to understand it. Science tells its own story to explain diseases.\\"  This is a book of stories, and Mukherjee is a masterful storyteller, weaving disparate stories into a single cohesive narrative of cancer. Though coming in at almost 500 pages and dealing with dense scientific and medical subjects, the book never slows down or feels sluggish. Mukherjee excels at simplifying the complex science into understandable terms; anyone, regardless of scientific or medical background, will easily grasp the concepts of cancer after reading this book.   As a medical student, I had already learned many of the conclusions to the stories that Mukherjee tells, but to learn the history behind these scientific discoveries was fascinating. If only there were books like this for all medical subjects. Highly recommended to all.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|The movie was great in the theater, but the DVD version is too dark. Details are obscure in many scenes.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game al around I really recommend this to any one who like gaming or just wants to plat a little
B00002N9ER|5.0|I agree with other reviews that these clips are TIGHT.  That's nice for holding the light, but I also agree that if your alignment is off too much it leads to premature failure.  Once again it would cost them nothing to include a small template strip of paper.  Little fold marks for 2D, 3D, 4D, 6D, whatever, would make it universal for any D maglite.  This is a theme with me and my reviews- stupid things like this cause product failures and bad reviews.  Maybe that's what they want to sell more brackets?  Either way I ordered more sets.  I'm not going to let them stop ME from sending them my money :P

B00149C8BK|5.0|Thanks to the Wii, my son fell in love with the music of Michael Jackson.  The top of his Christmas list was \\"Michael Jackson music\\".  I got him this CD because it included songs that my son would know.  He was ecstatic and as soon as he could he had it playing in his room as loud as he was allowed.  And because he is constantly singing his favorites, there are few days when I don't have 'Beat It' or 'Thriller' running through my head.

B000VBIGD6|3.0|We love this movie, so we were very excited to receive it as a Christmas present and watch it.  However, we didn't catch it was a \\"Special Edition\\", which means the language is not edited.  We didn't realize it would contain some pretty foul language and didn't appreciate it when we were watching it as a family.  Love the movie but not this edition!

B005VA8AZQ|5.0|I caught an episode of American Horror Story mid season and became instantly addicted.  I used my on demand to catch up on most episodes but had to buy episode 2 from amazon because I could not find it on demand and there were multiple references in later episodes to events  I grew up watching scary and suspense movies and LOVE this show!!  I also love Friday Night Lights and Connie Britton....  My favorite part about the show is that the ghosts cannot be removed from the show-- allowing for creative plot twists without character removal.  Nonetheless, if you like suspenseful movies or shows, catch up on the first season now!

B005LFQRTC|5.0|I remember the series from the early 1970's.  I have always loved the Six-Million Dollar Man.  It still has a lot of action to it.  It is everything I remembered from before.  I love to watch Lee Majors in just about everything he has ever been in.  I am still a fan!
B005H0IW6W|2.0|I bought this album because of all the publicity and hype, too bad.  It's just not my kind of music, it's too big bandish, too 50s for me, but then that's Michael Buble.  I especially don't like the Santa Baby and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Clause.  Wish I could get my money back!  Oh well...
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I wanted a DVD copy of Muppet Christmas Carol, and that's what I got. Price is fantastic, given this is not an easy thing to find normally.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Heart-warming story! Stunning photography! Who cares about the dubbing--there is no way to sync English with Finnish--the unique characters and excellent acting make up for it anyway. It makes me wonder, has Finland produced any other wholesome, family films like this one?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is one of my favorites. it has helped me start a healthy Bible reading program. the app also has many plans to choose from. I am working on the entire Bible in a year plan and so far I love it.
0312641893|5.0|Cinder had a lot to live up to and I usually dread reading books that I have heard nothing but wonderful things about.  What if I don't like it, what if it doesn't work for me?  Does that make me strange.  Well there wasn't anything to worry about here because I am jumping on the I absolutely love Cinder and can't wait for the next Lunar Chronicle bandwagon!<br /><br />Ms. Meyer has really impressed me with this book.  First she has constructed this future world that while not too different from our world is still different enough that needs explanation.  Yet she never mires us in the explanation.  She lets the description of the world unfold as you read the book.  I got to know more about New Beijing and the futuristic Earth as the book progressed and it flowed so nicely.  From learning about the cyborgs, to the hovers and life in New Beijing and the life on the moon as well.  Ms. Meyer has carefully crafted the world and it comes to life on the page and in the reader's imagination as you read.<br /><br />Second the characters.  Cinder, I love Cinder.  A futuristic Cinderella.  A taken-in cyborg and pseudo-step sister to one sweet girl and one vapid girl.  In this story Cinder is a talented mechanic and she is the provider for the family.  I really liked her character.  She's hard-working, she's strong and she's nice.  She loves and likes genuinely and she tries to be a good person and succeeds at it.  She is self-conscious at being a cyborg and a bit frustrated with it, but the reader understands this.  And of course Prince Kai, he is amazing.  Not stuck-up, but down-to-earth.  I loved him as well and pulled for him and Cinder through the book.  I look forward to future books to see what happens.  I loved the secondary characters as well, Ms. Meyer does a great job at making them interesting, nice, helpful or evil, whatever the situation needs.<br /><br />Finally there is the plot.  Wow, a lot is going on, but you are never confused.  You know me, I won't go into details because I don't want to spoil anything, but just let me say.  If you start this book, you will finish it because you will want to know what is going to happen.  I loved it and felt it moved at a perfect pace.  And the ending is great - it ties up nicely for this book, but it sets up for the next book as well.  Which I cannot wait for.  When is it coming out?  Soon I hope - get writing Ms. Meyer!<br /><br />So for me, Cinder has lived up to the hype so far.  It is a well-constructed story that held me captive for hours and kept me up past my bedtime (and that's hard to do when you take sleeping pills).  Cinder is a story for the ages, a new and original way to retell the Cinderella story.  I love the setting, the characters, the plot, oh my, what is not to love about this book.  Read it, and read it soon!o spoil anything, but just let me say.  If you start this book, you will finish it because you will want to know what is going to happen.

B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Imediashare has hit a home run the wifi streaming to my LG TV is great.  I particularly like the ability to search the channels video. 60 MINUTES and CBS news are my favorites and I watch them on my time.  If you have a wifi tv network capable you need this app. If not you can still watch the channels on your smart device. Get this app you will not be sorry

B006JPS1OM|1.0|I would really like to actually  be able to play, it looks like it would be fun. I can get just past the murder seen and then it freezes up and wont let me do anything! Very frustrating!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is often described as Young Adult, and since I do not fall into that category, I didn't begin reading the first novel with much enthusiasm.  However, after only a few chapters, I was absolutely hooked.  I read the whole trilogy in two days and then after a few days of dreaming about the books I decided to read them again.  I don't know if I can articulate what made this series so compelling and able to blow all of my other favorite books out of the water: Ender's Game, Harry Potter, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Christopher Moore books, John Irving books.  This story was just so believable.  I don't think it is a YA series, because Twilight fans will be dissapointed with the dark and unhappy ending of Mockingjay.  Katniss is a completely real and amazing character.  The trilogy made a very compelling statement about war, government, and society.  I won't count out the love story, because I really love Peeta, but that wasn't the most important aspect.  In short, I recommend these books to anyone, anywhere.
B00516ZWRE|5.0|This album introduced me to Saxon. I don't know how I managed to skip over them this whole time, but I've been listening to a lot of Saxon lately and keep going back to Call To Arms. Every song is powerful, memorable, and true to Heavy Metal. I love the current sound of Bill's voice. It reminds me of Halford in that the voice is aged, but still strong and with perfect vibrato. The album reminds me of Accept's newest album Blood of the Nations. Both are classic metal bands with a revival of their sound in this new decade of Metal. This is truly a great album and I hope the band continues in this tradition.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|You must play to unlock various games. Understand that before purchasing and this becomes a nice time sink of a game.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The microshell folio cover is sleek and smooth, with corner protection and a smart design. The only thing missing would be to magnetize the cover flap, but with the built in elastic band and at this price it is not a necessity.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is fun until you run out of points.  Lot of variety in the games.  Could use some other ways to earn.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|This movie was bad. It is almost as if the dialogue and the plot were written around the action scenes. The acting wasn't convincing. I didn't care about the main Character or his journey. I was completely indifferent toward the outcome of the movie. This would have acceptable as a cartoon that was released straight to DVD. The amount of good reviews should really be an indicator of the society we are crafting.
B00656C6KK|5.0|The music from her latest cd is timeless, and takes you away to a better place, just like her film do. I am constantly amazed how her voice can emote from sexy, to tender to wistful, sometimes in the same song.  Nobody tells a story by song like Doris Day, she makes every song seem like they are sung just for you.  I highly reccommend this album!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Can't go wrong with Solitare! The ads are a little bit annoying, but hey, it's a free game. I can't really complain.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I found this a refreshing book...different from most that I have read recently.  I loved the pictures mixed in with the text!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games in two days!  I read every free chance I got!  I was originally avoiding this book because it sounded like it like a stupid premise for a book and I don't read futuristic books.  My only suggestion is to read it before the movies come out.  I made the mistake of going on IMDB to check out the movie and it ruined the characters for me.  Suzanne Collins paints a wonderful picture of the characters... Let your imagination dream them up... Not Hollywood.
B005HSL626|4.0|I bought this for the Kindle Fire, not expecting much. I mean, really, it's a free game called &quot;fruit ninja.&quot;<br /><br />Boy, was I surprised to find that this mindless game where you slice flying fruit was ADDICTING.<br /><br />There are 3 modes in this version, 'Classic,' 'Zen,' and 'Arcade;' you can unlock additional blades and backgrounds by using them all. Yes, the ads in this free version may get annoying every now and then, but I've learned to just switch off my wi-fi before I play--it saves my battery, too!<br /><br />All in all, this is totally worth the 'tree's pricetag. If you're AT ALL curious, give it a go.
B0016MOWP0|3.0|i bought this movie used from goHasting and the case was in very bad condition and the disc had a few scratches on it but still played
B0058VW36U|5.0|First off, the cute little protagonist is named Om Nom. The premise of the game is that you're trying to feed this little bugger as much candy as you possibly can, essentially by navigating obstacle courses to get it to him.<br /><br />Awesome graphic, cute music (which you can turn off! Always a plus...) and plenty of levels make this game very worth spending ninety-nine cents. Heck, I'd probably pay more. Do buy, and enjoy!<br /><br />(I'm on a Kindle Fire)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great reading resource and helpful.. lots of available versions and most available for download for offline use Nasb,nkjv,cev,etc.  niv seems to be online only very good selection of reading plans too!

B001DCQIAA|5.0|I have tried to collect every CD of which I am aware of Karajan and the Berlin Philarmonic. To me his conducting and the Berlin Philarmonic sound is unsurpassed. I recommend it very much.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the games are fun and the perfect level of challenging. I really like that so far no additional money was required to unlock levels or advance. I'm hooked already within the first 15 minutes. this game is fun, it installed easily and works great. I recommend this app.
B000JPDJUY|3.0|Every single character, situation, plot twist, and word of dialog in this movie has been seen and heard a hundred times before. See if any of this sounds familiar: A capable but unconventional leader is asked to gather a rebellious group of misfits together and train them to succeed in a dangerous mission where wimpy, traditional men and methods would (naturally) fail. Throw in a tough girl who must prove herself, an antagonistic supervisor who hates the team and does all he can to thwart them, and a villain who makes Hitler look like Dale Carnegie. Does the Dirty Dozen or maybe The Magnificent Seven, just for starters, come to mind? The entire plot of this movie was already trite fifty years ago....and yet, I actually enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />Why? Well, I liked most of the characters (or should I say, caricatures), hated the villain (an idiotic supervisor....of course), and found the action sequences to be exciting and well done. One nagging issue was (SPOILER ALERT) how Jeremy Renner's character was able to organize an extremely complex escape plan, involving countless cohorts and escape vehicles, two pilots, an airplane, etc. in so short a time....but I can live with this, since nothing else in the movie was realistic either. Let's face it, once common sense is cast to the wind, anything goes.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you can take temporary leave of your common sense and triteness gag reflex long enough to watch a well-made action flick, then you will probably enjoy this one.
B003DZX44I|3.0|The movie looks good in blu-ray. Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the bonus features: during the \\"untold story\\" features, you cannot rewind or fast-forward the playback.  If you missed something, you have to restart the entire section from the beginning to see it again.  These limitations make it impossible for me to enjoy the bonus features.  You don't do bonus features this way.  EVER.  This is an elephant in the room that most people who review this product have ignored and it's very important to know.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these for running as I really don't like ear buds. In Wisconsin the weather can get pretty cold, so it took a while to figure out a good way to keep my ears warm while using them here. A head band is not a good option as it puts too much pressure on pushing the headphones into your ear. Wearing a thin hat and just pushing the headphones in under the hat worked very well, making these a great 4 season solution for me.
014241493X|3.0|I had no problem with the prodect and the amount of time it came but however i would like to take this time to reveiw the book just a bit with no spoilers. The Story in itself was well written and came down to an understand level to which it was quoted for aka young teen fiction. However, after reading the story did I feel encouraged to go and tell people they had to buy this book and read it now. I would advise this book as an ok read not amazing but not bad in any way.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play, its a good thing to do when bored I like it a lot. some of the games are a little bit blotchy though.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like it and the point system to unlock game! I like how there is 117 games! I don't like all the games on it though..
B004LWZVZC|5.0|All I can say is this was the best movie I saw in 2011 and I saw a lot of movies.If this does not get nominated of an academy award for best picture and Robert Redford for best director there is something wrong with the Academy and shame on them.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game has a lot of games in it but the quality and style of the games are both cheap and sucky
B0063IH60K|4.0|if you like solitaire, this is a nice interface. keeps you true to the game. easy fun way to spend time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game provides a decent challenge and progressive gaming ability that keeps you interested for hours. Some options are more challenging than others.

I find myself a little apprehensive to begin because once I start I know the end will be near.

I don't want to give any details besides saying that I think the things that happen are necessary for Mac to grow into who she is supposed to become. The shocks keep coming throughout Shadowfever I cannot tell you how many times I thought holy cow that cannot be true. I truly don't want to give anything away so I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way that Shadowfever played out.

0439023521|5.0|Wow...just wow! I kind of want to kick myself for not picking up this book years ago, yet, I'm kinda glad I waited until all three books were out so I don't have to wait for any of them...I'm impatient like that ;)<br /><br />So, just what did I think of The Hunger Games?! Eeep! I have so many thoughts about it right now. Clearly, I loved it and am itching to read the next book. But why did I love it? What did I love about it?<br /><br />Well, I love how very original it is. This series obviously spurred the popular dystopian trend in YA lit., and it really does still remain one of the most original and well executed dystopian books out there. The creativity and social/political/cultural awareness Suzanne Collins exhibits in THG is truly impressive. And I really love the simple fact that a book about kids fighting each other to the death has moved and inspired so many readers.<br /><br />The world building in THG is phenomenal! This gritty, stark, dark future world feels impossibly real and is artfully layered. And I think this realism is what fascinates many readers. This dystopian future, a future where kids are made to kill one another for entertainment, seems so outlandish and unbelievable, yet there's a terrifyingly thrilling aspect to the notion that maybe this future isn't so farfetched and the idea of humans getting enjoyment from cruelty, pain, and death isn't a foreign concept.<br /><br />The story itself is perfectly and effortlessly paced, and this pacing, along with Collins' superb world building, makes for one gripping and addictive read. I know I was simply unable to put the book down and was definitely sad to see it end.<br /><br />With such a captivating plot, a book like THG definitely needs a MC equally has captivating and, as many of you have already discovered, Katniss Everdeen simply shines! Katniss has definitely earned her place as one of my top three female YA characters, just after this first book! I loved her the moment she volunteered to take Prim's place in the Hunger Games. I have a baby sister that I love more than words can say and in that moment I felt like I was more than simply right there with Katniss, I felt like she had suddenly and intrinsically become a part of me. She's such a masterfully created character- equal parts strength and vulnerability, serious and witty, intelligent but not boastful, brave and selfless with a quiet grace. She's impossible to ignore and an unforgettable character.<br /><br />But there are so many wonderful, compelling, downright fantabulously awesome characters in this book right?! We have stoic Gale, charming Peeta, pull at your heartstrings Rue, oddly endearing Haymitch, sweet Primrose, fabulous Cinna, and a slew of other well developed characters.<br /><br />And of course I must mention the romantic aspects of this book! I know the basic plotline and story outline for the entire series, so I'm well aware of whom Katniss ends up with in the end. But even this knowledge didn't keep me from being able to enjoy the complex, heart-breaking, and breathtaking romantic elements in THG. Collins does a superb job of exploring Katniss' confusion and confliction where the romance is concerned.<br /><br />Then there's the Hunger Games themselves, which are equal parts fascinating and repulsive. Relentless, violent, startling, impossible to look away- this is how I describe the Hunger Games Collins describes so epically.<br /><br />Am I stoked for the upcoming movie? Umm, heck to the yes I am! So is my mom, who I talked into reading THG then proceeded to devour the whole series in about five days.<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: My mind has been blown. My fangirl heart has been captured. The Hunger Games is a riveting, powerful, captivating book.

030771652X|4.0|Bee Hemming is Tess' older sister and she has always been close and very protective of her little sister.  As the story starts, we are introduced to Tess through a letter that Bee is writing to Tess telling her how much she misses her.  Tess has gone missing and will soon be found dead.  All evidence points to Tess having committed suicide; however, Bee insists that Tess would never have taken her own life.  In her letter to her sister, Bee recounts the two sister's life together and also recounts how she begins to unravel the mystery of her death.  I found this a very emotional read that sometimes brought me to tears when Bee recounts her love for  her sibling.  The book is also a psychological thriller as Bee retells her thoughts on why she does not believe that Tess has committed suicide and her frustration with police and family as she tries to convince them of the irrationality of Tess taking her own life.  This is a sad but moving elegy to a lost sister and a great mystery read as well.

No scratches just garbled recording as in a bad pressing.  No visible defect but the same track won't play properly on any of my CD, SACD or DVD players.

0439023513|5.0|A satisfying conclusion to The Hunger Games Trilogy, Mockingjay takes the reader on a tour of duty in the war between the Thirteen districts and the Capitol.  Katniss becomes the face of the Revolution as she tries to reconcile the evils of war on the people she loves.  Katniss inevitably becomes a pawn in a lethal battle of wills between two giant forces and her personal consequences are devastating.<br /><br />Mockingjay is full of surprises, twists and turns that leave the reader shocked and surprised.  I think this is what I like best about The Hunger Games Trilogy is that the storyline of each book leads me on a nail biting adventure I wasn't expecting.  I loved the ending of Mockgingjay and that the author kept the reader guessing until the very end.  There is no way you could predict the ending.<br /><br />This is the only trilogy I read in 2011.  I read frantically the last week of the year to complete Mockingjay before 2011 ran out.  If you haven't started this series yet, I would say it is time to jump on the bandwagon.<br /><br />Another thing I love about The Hunger Games Trilogy is that is a multi-generational series of books that appeal to a wide variety of people.  My mom and my son have read all three books as well as countless nieces, nephews, teaching colleagues and my book club.  Now the movie versions are beginning in March of 2012 and I will be lined up to see them with my son on opening night.  Forget Twilight, these books are Hot, burning hot, like Katniss, The Girl on Fire!
0307888681|5.0|If you are a fan of zombie horror fiction get this book.  If you are NOT a fan of zombie horror fiction GET THIS BOOK!  World War Z made me a fan of this genre and World War Z is the best that I have read as yet.  It is fast paced fun and will have you looking around worrying about how zombies can get to you after you put it down.

B004O3YGMC|2.0|Every time I connect to my PC it changes the screen resolution. I mainly use it for controlling netflix on my PC, so its really annoying when you have to keep changing the screen resolution back to the default, otherwise the video is squished.

I was really hoping you would be able to share files between your PC and phone.  unfortunately, that you cannot do.  it does access your PC easily enough, but I fail to see the point if the files are still stuck at home anyway.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I just wanted to be the first one to comment on the Free App for January 6, 2012 and hope this is a good one. I will only give 3 Stars since I haven't used it and no more than 4 as I believe nothing is perfect and there's always room for improvement ;)
B000TFHJJQ|5.0|This movie ranks very high on my list of favorites. I guess will not be able to do justice by writing a review, just watch it.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|It is a Christmas tradition to watch this movie every year.  The Blu-ray edition came with both the original B/W version and the colorized version.  I never liked the colorized version because the color was never very good, especially in the shadows, but showing the colorized version to my sister and her husband, I found out that they fixed to color on the movie and it looks pretty much like it was filmed in color.  I still prefer the original B/W version, but don't mind the color version now.  They did a good job on remastering it.
B006P4HFH6|5.0|I'm surprised how enaged I became after the pilot episode.  Yes, it can be tough to follow at times and has moments where a particular scene seems \\"off\\" or implausible.  But I love how the series gets the viewer to actually \\"feel\\"  the expereince rather than spelling out what you're suppose to feel.  And I am amazed how each character can be both dark and still elicit empathy.  The show is scary, horrifying and tender.  Wow.<br /><br />It's one of the few series that made me want to see every episode (some times twice).  There's enough subtle content to make the second viewing worth it to pick up the clue you missed the first time around.<br /><br />It takes some work and attention, but I think it is worth it. It takes some work and attention, but I think it is worth it.  IF you like this genre, it is great TV.

B005H0IW6W|2.0|Love Buble', don't like this album.   One mic in the middle of the room with arrangements no better than classic Christmas albums.  The album is lacking energy to the point that I went out of my way to take it back to Wal-Mart only   for them to just give me a copy of the same... Oh Well.  Wouldn't it be nice if music was like a meal in a restaurant where if it stinks you could take it back???!  I suppose it's my fault for expecting more from Buble' being that David Foster has a bunch to do with him  on a musical level.  Michael if you are out there, I have a great original Christmas tune for you and you would do really well  to do an all original Christmas Album next year with David Foster Producing and arranging the enrire album  churchfirepublishing@gmail.com

B005MYEQ4U|2.0|Warning: spoilers below  I was so looking forward to finally seeing Midnight in Paris, after I had read and heard so much about it. I found it a disappointment, mainly because it was just what I had expected and nothing more. There is so much more to the real Paris, not just the standard sights and conceptions and obsessions with impressionism, post-impressionism, the early modern writings of Americans who went to Paris to write and drink during Prohibition. All the cliches are there and there is nothing new, not even the concept of falsely worshipping the past. The past is distorted here in so many ways. First, just when in the 1920s is that part of the film set? Fitzgerald, Hemingway (did he really talk like that?), Picasso, Bunuel, Degas, Matisse, Modigliani, Dali, Josephine Baker and just about everyone else Woody Allen could come up with in the film and all at the same time in that decade:  oh look, there's so and so and then there's so and so. The female extras wear styles of the early 20s, all except for the childish character of Marion Cotillard who wishes only to go back to La Belle Epoque. She isn't even wearing an authentic late-20s dress, it's too short (again a false cliche) and is really something from today (today being defined as the still-1960s lasting 40 years after its zenith). The 1890s folk at Maxims (Degas, was it?) comment on how pretty the dress was -- she would have been arrested or at least asked to leave Maxims for wearing it then. Instead she's offered a designing job. After all, didn't she assist Chanel thirty years in the future? And do we always need a cliche cancan? And what is with that hearse that comes to pick little Marion up? How were her memoirs published and why? That may be the low point of the movie. I was embarrassed for Cotillard because she had been so wonderful as Edith Piaf and she ends up in this junk. And the tune Parlez-moi d'amour played repeatedly at the end ... it was written in 1930 (look it up on Wikipedia). Nowfor Owen Wilson, who acts here so much like Woody Allen himself that he must be his alter ego. Wilson says in the Cannes interview on the disc that Allen left him alone to develop his own character. That is so hard to believe because he is imitating Woody Allen, with his whining and and confusion. This mirror portrayal is really spooky. Also, why do later disc boxes replace the Paris sky shown at first with Van Gogh's Starry Night and then add Rachel McAdams to Wilson's stroll along the Seine? Is she such a big star that Wilson needs her to sell the story? Allen said he wanted her because she was so beautiful and, oh year, also, a good actress, as is Wilson. If they truly are so great, it doesn't show up here. Her parents were the obnoxious right-wing cliches. Carla Bruni is a stick, physically and in her \\"acting\\". Pure vanity. Kathy Bates' Gertrude Stein was the highlight of the film, as she often is, and lent a little class to this mess.
B0063IH60K|5.0|really enjoyable! perfect for when you've got some time to kill, like waiting at the doc's office or getting your hair done
B002SQNM9A|4.0|My daughter is a huge fan of TS so this cd went in her stocking this Christmas. It's a great combination of favorite Christmas songs covered, and a few original songs. I only wish there were more songs on the album; I think there are only like 8 or 9. If you're a Taylor Swift fan this is must-have. We've really enjoyed it!

1423140591|5.0|With this new addition to the Percy Jackson series of the \\"Heroes of Olympus,\\" The Son of Neptune does a great job of blending in where it left off like so many of the previous books in this series. I have to admit that I was anxious of what really happened to Percy instead of learning of three new demigods from the last book. Haha!<br /><br />(Some spoilers: Don't read if you haven't read \\"Lost Hero\\" or \\"Son of Neptune\\" yet!)<br />I do have to say that even though Percy had his memory taken away just like Jason, Piper and Leo, his memory seemed to be more intact than the others which was a little disappointing with the time lapse. But considering that Percy has been the main character throughout the whole series just like Annabeth and Grover, I understand. And I did love that Percy still has his rebellious personality even though he'd been thrown back to the burnt mansion to find the wolf Lupa. In addition, it was fun to see Percy becoming a second in command of the Romans like Jason did of the Greeks at Half-Blood Hill. Although, I thought Nico (the son of Hades) would have more involvement in the story other than working in the background/underworld. Which that can be said for Zeus's daughter, Thalia too. Ever since she's joined Artemis's maidens, she's been left out, especially when she finally had a family reunion with Jason. It seems that those characters are being pushed aside as Zeus's, Aphrodite's and Hephaestus's children came into play.<br /><br />The other new additions in this series is Frank and Hazel and Arion (Hazels horse, which I love!) I was a bit confused when Frank and Hazel came into the story, though. But as it went on, they felt like a nice addition to the story as well. For Octavian (the seer/oracle at the Roman Camp), he was a cute stuffed animal sacrifice maniac! Especially Ella the Harpy! I felt really bad for her, being tortured in all. :( As for Reyna... I didn't really care much for her at times, especially when she tries to replace her old flame with Jason onto Percy.<br /><br />Anyway! I recommend this book hands down (just like all the others). It's been a long time before there were any great literature to continue to read without getting frustrated with killing off characters left and right and losing the whole plot of the story altogether. Every new addition to this series is like a breath of fresh air! The sneak peaks that are available of the first chapters online are also a great teaser when waiting for the new books! And I quite enjoy the ride and await the other two additions with great anticipation and dread (I don't want it to end!) I re-read all my books of PJ over and over again. :)onto Percy.   Anyway!

B004O3YGMC|4.0|Free app in amazon market today.  Tried this on my kindle fire, works great. Had it working in less than 5 minutes.  You can See & control you're PC on an android device - Neat.   only problem I have is the App says you can play PC games like WOW on your android device, but that seems impossible on the kindle fire because of the keyboard.. ( guess i could use a wireless keyboard .. )  other than that it does what it says & works great.

B004LP601S|2.0|I loved Panic! At the Disco's release A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, but this album, to me, does not reflect the same quirkiness and vaudevillian influence that their first album included, to my disappointment. It is much more mainstream, less original, and though I enjoyed the single The Ballad of Mona Lisa, and a few others like Sarah Smiles, most of the songs were mediocre, with trite lyrics, and the album as a whole lacked the character Panic! originally had in their music. When I heard the beginning of Sarah Smiles, I got excited because the use of the accordion sounded promising, and the song is decent, but as a whole the seemingly steampunk personality in the album artwork does not carry over into the music. Unfortunately, I probably won't be playing this very often...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|First you can connect your computer with ease. Then, if you can do it on your computer then you can do it and view it on your Droid or kendal fire. (I don't know about other devices because we don't have but just the two) Now I don't have to have a special app for my phone to mimic the programs on my computer. I just get on my computer from my phone and use the programs installed on the computer itself. You have complete control over your computer so if you are out and realize that you left an important file a home you can still axcess it. Also, if I'm out and my wife wants to show me something on the internet, I can just log in to splashtop and see exactly what she's looking at. Sure my phone has a browser and she could always email me a link to the page but using this program could make the steps fewer and faster.   Imagine now that you are at a job interview or maybe trying to purchase a new car; Instead of having to run home and email last years tax forms to them (or whatever nessecary documentation that you most likely don't carry around on your phone) you can get on your home computer (assuming you left it on and Splashtop is enabled) and email those documents right then.  I am a contractor and now I can easily use my computer and the specialized programs on it to axcess quotes or even write them up while I am out.  I think this could possibly be the most usefull app I have downloaded thus far.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|After hearing from EVERYONE how wonderful this game was, I just had to check it out. I have to say it's pretty danged fun! Perfect for playing during lunch at work or while waiting at the dr's office. I'm really glad I bought it!

B0055QYKQO|3.0|Installed 8gb of ram and kept getting memory dump and blue screen. Updated all drivers and still same problem. Replaced memory with some out of another computer and this worked OK. When the first memory was installed into the older computer it ran Great. Same thing happen with the Video Board. The New Board was a HD-6670 and we could never get good quality font. Very blurry and hard to read. Updated Bio, and card drivers and still the same. Replaced this Video card with one from another computer and all is OK. So now installed the HD-6670 into the older computer and fonts are clear and easy to read. This board just seems to be picky in what it runs well with.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|24 go in, but only 1 can win. \\"Set in a future where the Capitol selects a boy and girl from the twelve districts to fight to the death on live television, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister's place for the latest match.\\" This is the first book I've read in a LONG time that I really enjoyed from start to finish. From the first chapter I was completely into the plot and the characters which can only mean the author, Suzanne Collins, is a great story teller. The Hunger Games is basically a story about survival, government control, self awareness, + , possibly, love. I'm not going to give anything away in terms of story but I will say this book is definitely worth a read...and a reread, lol.  I'm very excited about the film adaptation of the novel coming out on March 23rd of this year (my birthday). I hope it lives up to the hype and I think it will because of the strong cast and the fact that the author adapted the novel for film herself. I plan on reading \\"Catching Fire\\" + \\"Mockingjay\\" before the month is out. I hope they are just as good as the first book. P.S.-I love my Kindle Fire.

B003HARV3Y|1.0|This movie was incredibly disappointing. All the good parts of the book were replaced with all sorts of weird unnecessary garbage. They also changed everything like Clarisse and Annabeth are the same people, there's no fight with Ares, they're already like 16 and 17 even though they're supposed to be 12, there's no Dionysus and capture the flag is totally messed up, they`re looking for the pearls from the beginning even though the water lady gives it to Percy when they're in Los Angeles, Kronos isn't even mentioned and so much more stuff. I could go on for several years. Also they make it so there's no way on earth for them to make a sequel (or any good video games) unless they do a remake. So my review may say I give it a 1 star but really it only deserves a negative 26.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is a terrible game, it is too addictive and aggravating... You will find yourself intending to waste 5 minutes and still be playing with birds an hour later.

B004DK5CYM|4.0|I didn;t ses Secretariat in the theaters because I just thought it was another rags to riches story so when I saw it on cable for the first time I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  I have a great fan of Diane Lane and John Malkovich and both of them are brilliant in this movie.  The film is very thoughtful and touches on one important social theme, women's liberation.  But it does so in a wonderfully subtle manner.  I love the racing sequences especially the last one.  This is a good movie for all to enjoy.

I am hooked and have tickets to his upcoming performance.

0007447868|5.0|I went into this book with lowered expectations. Fortunately, somebody warned me that certain crucial characters are completely missing from the book.  With all that in mind: this book is wonderful. Martin uses the chapter titles to assure us that some of these characters aren't going to get much screen time. These characters are crucial to showing us parts of Martin's world we'd never otherwise know, and by the end, we can clearly see how each of them is building to Martin's endgame.  And yes, some of our favorite characters are missing, but the story *about* those characters continues.  I loved this as much as any of the previous books in the series. It's lush, it's fascinating, and I don't in any way envy HBO the task of somehow turning this into ten episodes. The arcs that some of our central characters go through are remarkably elegant. I'm glad I didn't miss out on this part of the story.

B005HI7NP0|5.0|This body of work is so refreshing- it takes you through a genre of music that you either listened to when your parents were having rent parties or you were actually throwing the party. This refreshing blend of familiarity makes you long for relatable voices on the radio again. Kudos for showcasing Ms. Betty Wright's gifts in such a baptizing light.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I never comment on anything but this time its special, I just finished watching this and its 2:16 am and I dont care I just have to exppress just how amazing this wonderful performance was!! RAMIN was SOOO MOVING! his acting skills and singing skills are equally unbelievably amazing! Sierra and Hadley were so amazing too! DONT HESITATE, WATCH IT, BUY IT!! YOU ALL WILL LOVE IT!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love good,free games. easy customization, easy to play. I would recommend this game for anyone who likes solitaire or any card games.
B005J9ZDYK|4.0|If you're a fan it's a good set to have - but - it has a lot of duplicate videos that are on other disks!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a great App, and it works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire, which really surprised me, as I was skeptical at first.<br /><br />I like to play Pogo games, and was somewhat disappointed that I couldn't do so from the Web on my Fire, as apparently the Fire does not have Java, and I can understand that.  (I have enough game apps on the Fire to make up for it anyway).  But imagine my surprise when I got the Splashtop app and also their required Splashtop Streamer for my computer, signed in, captured my computer on the Fire, and found that I could play Pogo games just like I can on my computer, with all the sounds too!  I was amazed.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would use this app on an unsecured wi-fi network until I know the stream is encrypted somehow, but it'll be nice when I'm accessing a secure network at a friend's or family's house and want to check something on my home machine.  Or, even outside on my deck in summer when I want to play my web games.<br /><br />Love it, and thanks Amazon, for giving it to us for FREE!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is amazingly smooth, everyone should check it out! I love it. Stop making me review it amazon. All i wanna do is finish this review, stop making me do this
B005K17RU0|4.0|I tried a more common weather app, but found it didn't have easy access to the doppler radar maps I wanted.  This app does. It has been accurate and is everything I want for weather monitoring.  It works great on my Kindle Fire.  Yes, it does run in the background, but it's supposed to, in order to provide up to date forecasts or alerts.  When I'm offline, I use the Gemini App Manager app to kill the process and free up my memory.  I like it and recommend it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have tried a few of these apps and I think this is the best I've seen. The fact that you can put a dvd on  your computer and watch it on your android device with video and audio in decent quality and synced its awesome
1451627289|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in recent memory. The only bad thing about it was that it ended! The story is all-encompassing, and I put my life on hold to finish the book. I am 80s baby, but I still loved the depiction of the years 1958 to 1963. I really felt as though I was living in the story. The setting was painted perfectly and the characters felt so real. It was an extremely well-written book and the character development was out of this world. I am not a regular Stephen King reader by any stretch (the only other King novel I've read is Duma Key - another book I very much enjoyed), but this is a great book. Period. Whether it is outside his genre, it is an intriguing story that sucks you in. I did not guess the ending, however, it was in line with the rest of the book and I think the most perfect ending that he could have chosen. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an excellent read. Beware that it might take over your life until you finish!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This was beautifully filmed, acted, story.I don't even mind the redundant music. I can hardly waite to get the next season.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|It was a great movie with a great price. I was extremely satisfied with the fast service and delivery. I would highly recommend the movie and the service given by Amazon.[[ASIN:B000PMFS2I Showgirls (Fully Exposed Edition)]]
1449408656|5.0|Cannot stop reading it and laughing with my girlfriend and our beautiful cat. Thank you for this wonderful book. Cheers!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The seller was fast and efficient as the product came as described. i am very happy about this purchase. It was packaged well, and there was no damage.  The disc read perfectly without any skips. This is a very artistic, largely imaginary, yet powerful film.  I think it has such an interesting view of a child's way of seeing the world, and connecting to a broken man who doesn't want to live. Great film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I first played PvZ on the PC, and was thrilled to see it come to the Droid.  It can be a little rough on my Samsung Fascinate, it will occasionally crash, but it is a fun casual game with a lot of personality.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this app. I enjoy the old school games the most. It downloaded fast. The cards are a bit small so I play it with a stylus.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love Alarm Clock Xtreme, I've been using it for months on a daily basis.  The flexibility is great; to be able to gradually raise the volume of the alarm has proved useful, as has the 'math problems' option to make sure the alarm doesn't shut off 'by accident'.  The shake to snooze feature is neat, but I don't use it except on the weekends, and with a child in the house, there's not much snoozing on the weekends.  I like being able to schedule different types of alarms for weekdays and weekends, as well as being able to setup a 'vacation' from alarms or a one off alarm when I have to go into work early.  I also love that the app works regardless of how my volume settings are setup, so I don't have to worry about a missed alarm if my sounds are muted.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are pretty cheesy, but all in all good idea. I do like the point system it has set up.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Full featured - means you have to learn all the things it offers.  For example, in the 10-day view, you can tap the individual days to get detailed info, such as wind speed and direction.  I use the app regularly and have never had a problem.  Droid X.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I bought this because it looked like a great fantasy/sci-fi action movie.  When I watched it I found it hard to follow and poorly put together.  The transitions between some of the scenes are in some cases too smooth to even notice adding to some mild confusion if you blink.  I found the difference in volume from scenes varied to the point where I had to hold on to the remote to adjust constantly.  I normally don't rate movies because I understand that what one person thinks is great someone else might not but for something that looked awesome in the previews I felt it was a letdown.  I really wanted to like this and have tried to rewatch but I am still let down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i have had lots of fun!  I love all. the challenging games.  I hope you like them too.  good luck
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has everything you need to stay in the Word. Awesome job! I would recommend this app to anyone.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|people say the ads bother them but they are small and in the corner I don't notice them until I look I think you should defintly get this
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very functional and well-organized. I love all the features, better than other apps I have used. My only complaints: it requires Internet to use; while there is a handy Catch Up function for reading plans, where it sets you on the day you missed, it has no way to catch the plan up to the day the reader is on if the reader reads ahead.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the controls don't work as well as they should and the mini games are a litttle tough but other than that its a great app!
B0063GORYU|3.0|its kind of nice though the ads are annoying. it would be better with some nicer grafics and more game options
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been looking for a good app to remote it to my pc, this one dose it very well and the price is right.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you have ever played spider, you know what to expect. Nice time killer, and it beats playing with a deck of cards. Graphics are nicely done.
B00008A7QK|4.0|I was after only one song, but became impressed with the whole album this group did have it all in this period of music.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I had previously gotten the poetic and found it bulky and did not function as well as I had hoped.  I quickly switched to this one and LOVE IT.  Although it doesn't do the vertical standup I find that I mostly need it for horizontal viewing.  It holds the the kindle perfectly and adds barely anything to the dimensions.  I like how the softer cover for the screen easily folds back to keep it laying flat.  Some people complain about the Elastic not being stable because it it glued but I have had no worries or problems with it at all and I have been using it frequently for about 2 weeks now.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|It is easy to say that all of Lady Antebellum's music is great to listen to and this is another album that fits the description. This is another of the must have albums.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I have seen this movie before and wanted to add to my collection. Great movie, wonderful scenes and I get chills when I watch it. Have not had a great chill movie in a long time.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I am coming in late to the show but these three musicians are at the top regarding choice of music, arrangements and players of the instruments everything works great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun! some games are simple and some are actually a challenge!!!! its nice that you can replay a game in order to buy a new one in case you are stuck!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I had seen the trailer for the movie coming out and didn't want to wait til April so I got the book and I couldn't put it down. Now I am even more excited for the movie.  Love Nicholas Sparks!
0545265355|4.0|For those that like fiction and fantasy or sci-fi reads, this trilogy is a great.  I'm 25 and for me, these were easy reads.  The text is a good size.  I got these for Christmas because trailors for the movie coming out in March sparked my interest.  I also found out that a portion of the filming happened in Hildebran, NC which is a small town where I work which is pretty cool.  I just finished the last book Mockingjay last night (so I finished all three in under two weeks).  I liked that you couldn't predict what would happen next in these books.  If you like the Harry Potter books you would probably like these, they aren't quite as epic, but still good reads.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|One of my favorite apps. It's silly but it keeps you busy and passes the time. And as a free app, what is there to lose?
B003ODI67E|5.0|The Rational Optimist is one of those rare books which looks, in detail, at the pessimism about the future of our species and the world and wonders where people are getting their information.  The reason for this is because in every measurable way the world, and our lives in the world, are getting better and better -- materially...and happiness indexes are increasing too.<br /><br />The book sits alongside the following as a highly recommended read.<br /><br />Pinker, Steven.  The Better Angels of Our Nature<br /><br />Gardner, Dan. The Science of Fear (also published as Risk)<br /><br />Gardner, Dan. Future Babble<br /><br />There are others, but these will get you started.<br /><br />Just a quick look at the table of contents will tell you a lot<br /><br />1. The Unprecedented Present<br /><br />2. Exchange and Specialization<br /><br />3. Barter, Trust, and Rules<br /><br />4. Farming<br /><br />5. Cities<br /><br />6. Population<br /><br />7. Energy<br /><br />8. Invention<br /><br />9. Pessimism<br /><br />10. Africa & Climate Change<br /><br />11. Catallaxy (spontaneous order created by exchange and specialization p. 355...Kindle iPad edition)<br /><br />Mr. Ridley does not believe there will no longer be wars, famine, pestilence, natural disasters, economic downturns, etc.  However, he believes the general thrust is an 'evolution of prosperity' and goes long way to proving this while eschewing, until the very end, a trip into futurism.  The last being the only weak point in the book...for reasons he makes abundantly clear in his argument.<br /><br />This book is an excellent rejoinder to the almost universal pessimism that is abroad in the world today (and has been at least since the late 60s) and well worth the time this book takes.  However, it is written with the general reader in mind...so it is a pleasant experience.<br /><br />One of my first 5 star books of 2012.  Read it and be enlightened.
B006OT03BM|1.0|For $135?  What else needs to be said - for that kind of money I don't purchase three movies - what a scan.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun and there is a good variety, but every few minutes there is a giant advertisement, which is extremely annoying. I also wish there were a few more advanced games to do.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|One of the best games in the world for free! I love how hard it is with difficulty all the way up. It's like playing a grandmaster.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|This is one of the Best, low budget movies, made in the last 50 years. The casting of young talented non-professional actors was a stroke of Genius. The dialog in the script kept the young teens comfortable in their own environment and believable. The Movie scenario was totally coherent. The Actors, believable, even to the attitude and reactions of young people whether in the UK or the US. And finally, a Science Fiction Story with a totally new type of ALIEN ENCOUNTER. The writer should be commended for their fresh perspective, instead of taking the easy route and re-hashing old ideas.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am pleased with this app.  A lot of different plans to follow if you want to read the whole Bible.  So far no bugs using the Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is perfect i love the rewards and the selection of games way to go keep up the good work
B004O3YGMC|5.0|absolutely perfect. easy install, worked on the first try, its nice that I can control my computer while away. set downloaded while away
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Wow!  Now I can even play all my songs from Itunes Match in the Kindle Fire.  I can remotely control my PCs similar to LogMeIn.<br /><br />It is easy to configure - 2 minutes including download time.<br /><br />Just download it first in your Kindle Fire.  Then download a file from their site called Splashtop Streamer to every PC you want to have access on.  The  Splashtop streamer will give you an IP address that you will need to connect with your Fire - that's it, you're done.<br /><br />This is also available for iPads and is one neat way to make it display Flash.  The caveat, you need to be connected to a PC.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not saying it's the best book ever written. It has it's flaws and literary snobs will poopoo it. But what a fun and compelling read. I couldn't put it down. Once the games begin the book really gets good. Do yourself a favor and buy this.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The set&ndash;up process is quick and painless, I was on my computer's desktop via this app within 5 minutes. It's so convenient to have full access to my PC back home. I can stream hulu shows that are web only or stream spotify music to my kindle fire. The developers have gone above any expectations I had.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|a great remote desktop app.  perfect for kindle fire.  a must have! I highly recommend .  need more words here
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and I love playing this game.  He is a big fan of strategy games and this one is more fun for me compared to some other strategy gmaes so it is a good compromise!
B004VQRCF0|5.0|A Yes fans delight for sure. This is the last tour Yes did in large venues.<br /><br />Not for the first time listener, this show was for the real fans.<br /><br />8 of the most talented Rock musicians to ever form a single band (if for only one tour).<br /><br />Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe meet the 90125 guys for a great tour. I saw 3 shows of this tour in 1991 and this DVD is a treasure for me. If you remember this tour you will love this DVD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this game just the sheer randomness of idly makes it fun to me now I wan just filling for words
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a really good app. I have been streaming videos to my o.g. incredible all day. Easy set up and great interface.  Definitely one of the best free apps so far. The free paid app a day thing really is great.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good App for blowing off some free time. Easy to set game. Would be better without Ads, but it is free...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Got and kept my attention from beginning to end! Can't wait to finish all three books! I'm a hopeless romantic so I of course liked the suspense of the relationship/s.
B005HSL626|1.0|just keeps stopping game for lame ads. not worth it, even being free. the apple version is so much better.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This inexpensive cover protects the Kindle Fire as promised. No frills but does what it advertised to do and was easy to fit onto the Kindle.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app is awesome very easy to install and easy to master... My only issue is that I am experiencing issues with the typing from my phones keyboard while on my pc but other than that it's awesome
B004I2K4DY|1.0|lucy johnson--this CD was Completely blank, as were two copies of BRING HIM HOME--THE VALJEAN QUARTET.I was very disapponted, because I had looked forwaard tp them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app. I love all of the games.but it can be a little bit frustrating. It is still okay.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Overall I enjoyed this book. I liked reading about Cassia and her new journey. I also thought the world they created was pretty cool. I just feel like not a whole lot happened.   I also didn't like the story being told from both Ky and Cassia's viewpoints. It was confusing (especially when they were together). I had to keep looking back and trying to remember which of the two was narrating. I also felt like there wasn't enough Xander. If Condie is really trying to keep this a love triangle than he lost out in this segment. Also, I really liked Ky in the first book, but this installment made me like him less.  I am very excited for the 3rd book. I think it will be good, but I think this book was all just set up for that one. I think a lot of 2nd books in Trilogies do that, but you can still make it interesting. Take Catching Fire from the Hunger Games series. Set up for 3rd book? YES! But it also was a thrilling and exciting ride.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great app that is easy to use and fun. I can see the cards well and move them easily. It is the best solitaire I have played.
B005GVF95O|1.0|I swear, like every free app of the fay is for ages like 1-4. its getting pretty old. so please, more for the middle ages and less for the 3 year olds who don't even own phones.
B000QCS9NM|2.0|Too much profanity for my taste. My first and only book of him was Fight Club and I liked it a lot but this one is kinda stupid.
B005BJ7Y54|5.0|Holding out for Christmas presents may make economic sense but in the case of \\"Father, Son, Holy Ghost\\" by the remarkable \\"Girls\\" it amounted to a prolonged form of musical torture. Listening to this album almost constantly for the past week confirms one of the great unheralded albums of 2011 with enough variety, charm and innovation to make other contenders seem woefully shallow and painfully inadequate. In one sense no surprises here for their brilliant debut \\"Album\\" (see separate review) was a blast of spaced out joyousness not least containing two of the best songs of the past decade \\"Hellhole rat race\\" and the irresistible exuberance of \\"Lust for life\\".<br /><br />At the time their resident genius Christopher Owens told Uncut that \\"it could have been \\"Pet Sounds\\" if they had decent equipment to record it on\\". In one sense it's a nice bit of bravado, but in another Owen is travelling a path within the 54 minute boundaries of \\"Father, son and holy ghost\\" which is almost peerless on the current rock music scene with a scale of ambition which is admirable and almost obscene. Equally the musical step up from their debut is huge and you wish that whatever source of inspiration Owens is drinking from that he would buy a round for some other bands far less blessed. Listen to the great folk gospel single \\"Vomit\\" and its starts off evoking Radiohead of the era of OK Computer but by the end almost reprises \\"The great gig in the sky\\" with a Clare Torry style fade out. It's a superb song although matched by the gently boiling melancholia of the nearly 8 minute long \\"Forgiveness\\" one of the loveliest drifting songs you will have heard in a long while which builds to a great climax and instant recourse to the repeat button. It is often the simplicity of this album that makes it so great, for example the slow rock n roll blues of \\"Love like a river\\" could have easily been written by John Lennon as Owens niftily recasts a universal melody, while \\"My Ma\\" calls to mind vintage Neil Young. Equally the poptastic \\"Hunny bunny\\" with its hint of surf rock inspired harmonies does not break no ground but its just great, while \\"Die\\" is polished glass indie rock which will commence by knocking the ducks off your wall and yet fades out sounding like a missing link to Pink Floyd's \\"Wish you were here\\". The closer \\"Jamie Marie\\" shows that Owens probably has a great solo album up his sleeve, a gentle Dylanesque lament which is the perfect lo fi end to proceedings, while the tightly strung opening guitar lines of the lengthy \\"Just a song\\" lead into a complex structure, a sort of modern aquatic nightsong.<br /><br />On the evidence presented on the truly wonderful \\"Father, son, holy ghost\\" it is clear that Christopher Owens is a first class pop savant who has produced an album which the Irish Times has rightly argued has \\"countless depths to plumb and myriad layers to unravel\\". Thus before facing in the direction of 2012 pause and step back into 2011 for an untrammelled pleasure.Equally the poptastic \\"Hunny bunny\\" with its hint of surf rock inspired harmonies does not break no ground but its just great, while \\"Die\\" is polished glass indie rock which will commence by knocking the ducks off your wall and yet fades out sounding like a missing link to Pink Floyd's \\"Wish you were here\\".

1612130585|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read (Fifty Shades of Grey is the other!).  Can't wait for the third book!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You should love this game too! If one person likes it everyone should! So do you like this game as much as I do?
1612130283|5.0|Love, love, love Christian and Ana.  I laughed and cried and cheered.  E L James is my hero!!  Can't wait to see what else she has in store!
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Fine if you want to leave your computer at home unprotected at all times...It seems a strange way to emulate RDP.  Just my thoughts at a glance.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|As someone who is a huge fan of film(many would say im a film snob). I have seen all the classics, I see all the indie films, all the blockbusters, and foreign films. Movies are my passion. So if you told me, that a Muppet movie would end up being my movie of the year, I simply would not believe it. But this film simply works. Its a perfect movie, and their are very few movies i can say that about. Do i think its one of the best movies of all time? No, but it set out to do be a happy, fun and simple movie, and it did it succeeded one hundred percent. Never have i walked out of a movie, feeling so utterly happy about it. I saw this with my girlfriend and she agreed, it just makes you feel happy. The songs are great, the writing is great, the pacing is perfect, it never ceased to entertain me.  This is a must see.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I have tried some plain ole\\" component cables before, and some with a little more heft to 'em, but none have ever had the build quality of the Amazon Basics cables, nor did they have the performance of these cables. I almost thought I was pulling HDMI when I first hooked up, but it was only 1080i, not bad, huh.  So buy them if you want top of the line cables, and top of the line performance. And ----- they are just pretty to look at too.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|So far this is completely useless. It will not find my computer either remotely with gmail or with my wifi and ip address. Cannot find any help online as to how to use this or make it work. Too bad as it would ne useful. UNINSTALLING!!!!!!!!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|this app definatly deserves 5 stars I love all of the modes and acheivments I have unlocked them all except for th sparkle blade I mean  come on how do they expect you 2 get 3 pineapples in a row! anyways no clue why e/o is going crazy over the ads totally not that bad
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Although nothing could replace the book, the DVD The Help was a wonderful adaption and enjoyable to watch. Shipped quickly and was a great Christmas present to my mom
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|idk what everyone is going crazy about it is not fun  AT ALL!!!!!! i guess they just made such a big deal about it so that everyone has in their mind that its the gr8est game ever and really thinks that they like it but there is nothing to like about it. I wouldn't bother getting it if I were u.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have been play for three days staright and still finding games to play. I like the fact that you to open games, but I do not like the fact the games don't change.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|How many people really need a waterproof housing? I want to be able to plug in a microphone, USB cable, and remove the SD card without having to take the camera out of the case every single time.  this is the case that should have come stock. Recommended.
076115728X|5.0|This is a great book.  Many of the pages have multiple flaps.  Its well illustrated.  The only potential issue is that my 14 month old is a bit too young for the book.  She likes the flaps but pulls a bit too hard on them.  We had to re-tape one of the flaps.  But I am still giving this a 5 star review.  The book is recommended for older kids so its more my fault than the books that one of the flaps got pulled off.  And it was easy to fix with some double-sided tape.  For now the book goes up on the bookshelf.  She will like it more in another year.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Today this app is the free app of the day and it is amazing. I definatley likewise it and it is deffinitley worth the $4.99
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app works great! Wouldn't have had it if it weren't for free app of the day. Does exactly what it says it does. I only wish the app would allow me to transfer files to &amp; from the phone. Once that happens it'll get 5 stars.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I wish this would have been one they got together recorded and left in one of their little vaults of stuff and long after they were dead someone could find it and go...hey look at this...then I would be too old to even hear...
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought a Kindle Touch and absolutely loved the Kate Spade Pride and Prejudice case, but unfortunately it was \\"sold out\\"/going to take some time so I settled on this one. I bought this one after my dad and I both misread the measurements between the Fire and the Touch (I'm guessing we looked at the keyboarded kindle) and only after it shipped did I realize it was about .7\\" different lengthwise. I thought about cancelling /refusing it but I'm glad I didn't. The touch fits snugly and I'm not worried about it falling out at all. I'm actually wondering how you can cram the Fire into this case. There's some rubber on the backs of the straps so it doesn't slide around. There is a mat that sits on the back that hangs over a bit, but that's my fault as it's made for a different Kindle. Overall I really like this case and have no complaints.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I now have YouVersion on my Kindle Fire along with Joyce Meyer devotional through YouVersion! I cannot say enough good things about YV!!  Continued blessings to y'all:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun set of games! You cant beat the price lol, I like the point system to unlock more games, instead of gilding overwhelmed.
1596680296|5.0|I love this book! I read many sock books and still didn't feel ready to try knitting my first pair. This book changed that! I am on my third pair now. The book has a theme of a basic sock pattern which is shown for child sizes through men's. Then, she repeats the pattern for different yarn weights. So nice! But even better, she takes you through EACH STEP WITH LOTS OF PICTURES! This clicked for me. There are some other styles included as well, but I view this as the absolutely best sock book for a newbie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's not a bad way to pass the time. I get annoyed if I can not do well on a game and just keep trying. It kinds sucks you in!
1451627289|5.0|I bought this book for my husband. He's a Stephen King nut. He will not put it down. He says it's great. I can't wait for him to be done so I can read it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is great and relaxing. I don't care for the pop ups for other game apps but this works.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|aside from draining the battery like a mad man this app is great. can be anywhere with a connection and access any file or program I choose. itunes from my computer on my EVO makes me smile.
B004H3WWU2|4.0|I bought this bag as a gift for my BF. He tends to travel a lot and also walk to work a good amount.  I thought this would be great for both because it 's sleek, but also rugged. Unfortunately, the bag itself is really compact so it does not really work well as a travel bag, unless you are traveling SUPER light. He has mentioned though that this bag has made walking to work much easier, than say traveling with his older bag that went over one shoulder.  The bag has some nice pockets that are great for keeping things organized. However, the pockets on the straps of the bag for cellular phone devices is quite small. A normal sized smart phone is a tight squeeze, if it even fits at all. Also the pockets on the side for water bottles, etc is pretty tight and probably only fits certain kinds.  One other thing about this bag that may be a deal breaker for some people is that it does not stand upright. It is so slender that it will tip over if you try to have it stand on its own.   Overall, the bag is very professional looking, has great storage for laptops and its accessories, but there is not very much else, which is good if that's what you're looking for. If you are looking for more storage I would suggest going with the other Booq Boa models.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|From Pocket Cloud to I-tap,  I've tried them all.  If you want a live audio/video stream of your desktop,  this is it!  Hulu,  Veetle,  Firefox,  Office,  all stream smoothly from your desktop to your mobile device. Adding encryption would be my only request.  Solid remote client.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|It is hard to find a good clean movie that you can watch with your family. This is one to see. I have watched it a couple times and my daughter watched it every day during Christmas break. GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!
B005HSL626|2.0|DONT BUY, i just recently bought this app, its full of Ads, it freezes constantly, and shuts it self off....
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a fun game that is quick and challenging. the game is fast paced and you cant take moves for granted. the game becomes addictive.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|Teenage angst explored in a quirky, hysterically-funny \\"art\\" film. Unexpected twists and dialogue. Witty, dry humor with a retro yet timeless feel. Brought me right back to teenage emotions and thought-processes; would recommend to some teens as well as adults. My male friend and I were laughing out loud while watching it - NOT a \\"chick flick\\" by any means. Perhaps a lighter \\"Quadrophenia\\"?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I find the games rather addicting but I do not enjoy getting credit card solicitations after a round or two of the games.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I have been using TeamViewer for some time now and it is great to have a mobile version. Takes some getting used to the scrolling but great over all.
0545265355|5.0|Loved it! Super easy, exciting, and intriguing read! I was skeptical because it was considered a juvenile book but I am really glad I chose to read it.
B00136Q1I0|4.0|i essentially bought this album to cover only the top hits of Bruce Springsteen's career..the ones that went top 40, didn't care about most of the lower charting singles on here that may have splashed into the top 100 singles briefly back in the 70s and 80s..examples would be: the river, badlands, etc. The ones i hoped to score without having to buy this plus a couple from other Springsteen albums include:<br />1. Glory Days<br />2. Dancing In the Dark<br />3. Born In the U.S.A.<br />4. Born to Run<br />5. Hungry Heart<br />6. I'm On fire<br />7. Cover me<br />8. Brilliant Disguise<br />9. 56 channels<br />10. My Hometown<br />The greatest hits collection leaves out two of my essentials: 'Cover me' and \\"i'm on fire\\", which i had to purchase separately for $1.29 each, i was disappointed about that. I would've been much happier had they chose to elminate all the rest beyond my top 10, and include extended rare mixes of \\"cover me\\", \\"dancing in the dark\\", and \\"born in the u.s.a., in addition to the standard versions. But alas, that wish goes unfulfilled...
B004RJMUJO|4.0|his a great game but does not have all the updates on the blades and backrounds on the ios i am kinda disappointed cause of the blades and backrounds on the ios
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this in two days, couldn't put it down.  Great book that sucks you into the story from the beginning.
B00634GHJA|2.0|Primitive makes using a tablet more complicated than simply using your Pc.  Imagine being in the bedroom and this app forces you to get up and go to your computer to  sign on.  So the portable kindle is now not do portable ..n
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a good way to pass the time if your tracking or something you need to pass the time with it is a bit challanging though
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Easy to play, mind numbing fun. Easy to unlock new games and each one is pretty decent. Controls are a little sticky, though.
0545265355|5.0|I really loved this series. It was so exciting. I like the boxed set because as soon as I was done with one I could start the next one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really like this . good for little ones and a good time killer for older kids. wouldvgive 5 stars except controls are iffy
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very fun if you like solitaire this is a good app for you it is so easy to play
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is perhaps the best accessory created for the iPad 2, because it not only allows you to use your camera or SD card with the kit. It also allows you to use any viable USB device with your iPad (and I do mean ANY). I use the USB connection kit to connect my keyboard, and with a little help from a Powered USB Hub (I Bought a Belkin product for about $14), I was also able to connect my Yamaha Audiogram 6, loaded with microphones and instruments. I can only conclude that this is genius. If you're a musician, or producer on the go with Garageband on your iPad, this is an accessory that you cannot do without. There is no latency. My condenser mics (with 48 phantom power) produce crisp sound through Garageband. This is truly a revolution in the portable technology industry. Kudos to Apple.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great and exciting it keeps you interested for hours and many more to come.the game is the best one.this game also gets the brain to work.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|I love reading paranormal romances, but I have to admit that lately they all seem to blend together. Sometimes I confuse characters from different series. So this was a breath of fresh air as far as what the male lead is. Though I've seen shifters before in other stories,this character is amazing.<br /><br />There were times where I found the two lead characters inconsistent and I had a hard time believing that a creature who lived since the dawn of the galaxy is not up with the times.<br /><br />Other than that it was an enjoyable read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is the best solitaire game I have played in a long time. I love all of the options. I reccommend it to all solitaire lovers.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|I must say something about this dvd.But I can only say if you love Bones than you have to buy this DVD
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so cool, you can play a ton of games and there is all different varietys of games. I would highly suggest. this game for all age groups.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Ever feel confused by what's happened and currently happening with our economic system?! This is a well done film to give clarity as to how the housing market, wall st. and the government have manipulated us, the American People into believing that it was an unpredictable occurrence. This film woke me up and helped me understand the bigger picture. It's also helped me with names and faces of government officials that are currently in office that I can now follow online accordingly. There are a lot of good films out there, but this one is well done and not painful to watch as other low budget films. I recommend this as a gift to all your friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the second book of the Hunger Games Trilogy. I thought after i read \\"The Hunger Games\\" and saw how amazing it was that no book could compete but Catching Fire was even better! I Found myself reading for 7 hours at a time without looking up from the pages. This book is very suspensful and it captivates the reader's attention from the very first page. I would reccomend this product to anyone who enjoys reading about adventure, action, dystopian science fiction, love and suspense. This book is for all ages and a great gift for anyone who enjoys reading.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|It couldn't be a more pertinent time to watch this video with the controversy over the Keystone Pipeline. We often hear the possible environmental hazards of oil drilling, but when we watch television and see commercials for Natural Gas as \\"clean\\" energy I find it incredibly disturbing. I have spoken with friends from Colorado that verify this is an real epidemic in their area and last year, my parents who live in N. Idaho were told/threatened to \\"reclaim\\" their water on their land to be able to complete their taxes appropriately. The motivation for this is?? After doing more research after this film, I found that a large German Company controls a lot of water in NW Montana that's correlated to a Natural Gas Co. If there's any natural resource more precious than water, I haven't found it. I purchased multiple copies of this film to hand out as Christmas gifts this year and hope you share it as well. Thanks again for the hard work by this film maker.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is beyond amazing. I completely the entire series in just 3 days! Once you pick up this book you will find your self having a hard time putting it down. Suzanne Collins did such a nice job writing this, it's so captivating. This book is so detailed that you will feel as if you yourself are the main character, Katniss, fighting for your life in the Hunger Game Arena. This book is not only suspensful and action packed, but it is also a love story that will have you falling in love with the characters. You will not regret purchasing this item!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I had been using PhoneMyPc and it was great, but it couldn't stream video. I bought this and I like it way more. I mostly use it for work, but I love that now I can watch sports on the go. Works great on my galaxy Nexus.
B0062KJ1Q6|1.0|This movie is not funny.  It is a complete waste of time and money.  Plus the movie is vulgar and produces no positive moral story.
B005T87QCI|1.0|the game is way to hard and theirs only 8 robots oh and if you have seen the movie you will hate this game
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun game easy to use vibrant colors. works good with touch screen. can spend hours playing and not get the same lay out twice.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This low budget fun movie is a top notch piece of good viewing. Just the right actors, characters, and the story needed to be done. Thanks to all involved.
0316017930|3.0|This is a very easy read and very engaging.  I have always agreed with his overall point - that success is dependent on a lot of things other than the individual's intelligence.  Now I have some data to back this up.  However I don't think I can use everything in the book since I felt some of his other data was a bit flimsy to hold water.  And sometimes he just simply stated some random fact that supports his point and moved on. Overall, excellent read, just take some of his conclusions with a grain of salt.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I ordered this with my Kindle Fire after watching the video on the listing.  When it arrived I was surprised by it's cheap appearance and feel.  I like the fact that you could use it as a stand but I don't think it would hold up or protect my kindle from damage.  I ended up returning this one and getting a very nice one from Tuesday Morning for $12.99.  It stated it was for the Nook but my Kindle fire fit nicely.  And it was padded!
B00275EGWY|2.0|This is a genre film: war is hell. They made these by the dozens in WW2. Here, we go to Iraq for a few days in the lives of some bomb defusers. This is not a subtle movie. You will wonder why the US ever bothered to send people to such an absurd place. Tension builds throughout as we expect most of the soldiers to die grisly deaths. Some do. Some don't. In the end, we are told, some prefer this way of life over civilian life. HHmmmm....where have we seen that theme before in a story about battle-scarred soldiers? You won't learn anything watching this. I can't quite pronounce it entertainment, either.
0307891372|5.0|Amazing product,detailed and HUGE! All you want to know about the game is in the book. I would buy it again if something happens to it. Great!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Bible App is a great way to get into God's word every day. Highly recommend for anybody interested in devotional studies. I like that it has the ability to highlight and allows me to write notes. It's also very helpful in looking up a particular book, chapter, and verse. I would have given it 5 stars except it doesn't work if you're not connected to wi-fi which can be inconvenient at times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game all the time. No flaws!! IIs easy. to play and best of all it is free. You cant get much better then this game of solitaire.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Might be just because the application is on the giveaway of the day offer today  but tried to install this on 3 different phones including the wife   Buy App [Check] that works.  Click to install [Check] That downloads the broken apk file  Click to install on phone ... installing ... installing... failed to install.  Error parasing the Application.  So go into the cache folder delete this broken apk.  re-try again (2 hours later) same issue.   tried 30 + other applications from previous days they are all fine.  and install great, so there is a serious application download error/fault with this version.  i'd like to know if anyone else is having the same issues it cannot just be me.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|never buy this game slowed down my kindle fire and was very confusing. so rite when I got it I deleted it rite away
B00632HWOG|5.0|I was upset that I couldn't scroll down past 10 of my emails, untill I desided to look at some reviews to see what everyone had to say about it....  and found that all you have to do is turn your kindle length wise and it will show all your emails.  Once you've done that, you can turn it back to horizontal, and it will work that way too. I t works great. :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've used a lot of remote desktop solutions in my time and am VERY impressed with how well this works on my Kindle Fire.  It works exactly as stated, and uses 3 open ports on the network.  This is the second time I've seen this as Free App of the Day... jump all over it.  The remote desktop ability is better and more useful than you'll realize until you get it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app.  I just leave my imac at home connected to all my external hard drive with movies and music and can always have access to them.  plus I can literally control my computer from anywhere with wifi...I have a kindle fire and it works very well.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|app works great through wi-fi, but I cannot connect to my computer through 3G or 4G. When that issue is fixed it will be 5 stars, but for now it's only 4 :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun puzzle game with just enough difficulty to keep it interesting with enough gameplay to take a while to. beat.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|The aVia player is good it works perfectly with my dlna server through my router.  However it automatically put my song playlist in alphabetical order.  This is a real pain because it completely messes up my music.  Otherwise. a good product that does what it advertises.
044654759X|3.0|Although this book was a good and fast read, about 1/3 of the way into it Julia Roberts face kept coming to view in my mind.  Sleeping with the Enemy anyone?  The story line of this book is all to similar to that of Sleeping with the Enemy.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend to other readers.  Had a little twist at the end which was nice.  Not my favorite Sparks book only due to lack of originality with the plot.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|i'm sure all i have to say has been said so i'll just add that it comes with a small poster
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I just love the app ,it was easy to install, I got both my desktop and laptop to connect flawlessly. I have been looking for a way to get Pogo a game site I am a member of to be playable on my kindle fire and now I have it ,all the games load fast and are playable. Before this app ,none of the games off pogo would load. Now I really love the kindle even more. I love being able to get into my other computers with the kindle. Opens up a new world for sure. BUT like other viewers I am disappointed by the lack of security that is offered. But it is a very cool app and very User friendly.
1451648537|5.0|I have downloaded the sample of this book wandering how it would be. It is awesome believe me. There is a reason why this book gets so many excellent reviews. After about 30 minutes of reading the sample I purchased.the book and got one day shipping because I want it. I cant wait because there is an Amazon warehouse close to my house. So Overall this will be my best book purchase. I have actually never been into books but this changed that.
1846467640|3.0|I was surprised to see how tiny the Peppa Pig Little Library really was, so more suitable for babies and young toddlers.
1401323952|5.0|As usual Nigella is superb. Her recipes are simple yet delicious and always different.I love her easy going style and you feel she is talking just to you
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have spent endless hours using this tool to look at networks at home, at work and school. Very cool to be able to SHOW someone why their network doesn't work very well. Very responsive receiver and graphics and the response rate can be changed in the settings. Like many aps, you have to take the time to explore. Much of what makes it valuble require you to change some of the settings to refine what you are seeing. The only improvement I could suggest is more clarification on looking at 2gHz versus 5gHz signals. But for what it does it is outstanding!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app really helps me to stay on top of my daily Bible reading with pre made reading plans.The ease of accessing different versions and community input are great for a better understanding.  .
B002JT69NC|5.0|This movie is a really good suspense horror/teen movie. If you like weird, scary and something that revolves aliens then this movie is a good choice. Plus the setting is on a school.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was blown away by this app. It was super easy to install and works great on my Kindle fire. Being it was free makes it even better. This is one app that will be used a lot.
B003UMW68Y|3.0|The product brings the blu ray disc itself, as well as the regular DVD. This Disney movie is alright not too good as the other ones. It is mostly about singing, group singing, rhythm and anything about music. the visual is set in 3D but very good graphics. The movie is good to watch but not over and over like other Disney movies.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The ability to start watching hulu on my PC and then finish it on my tablet or phone is fantastic. I have tried a number of these types of apps and this one seems the most polished. The streaming within the LAN  has been flawless. (haven't tried over the internet yet.) The only downside that kept it at 4 stars is that it is resource intensive on both the serving PC and the device, but it is well worth it.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Any app that requires me to install custom software on my other PCs isn't worth it. All the major operating systems come with built in remote access software, so why can't this leverage those? Install the custom software where desired or where a native tool isn't available, but don't require it. It's just obnoxious. Thank god I got this as the free app and didn't pay for it.
0765350386|5.0|I am a big fan of Rothfuss, Weeks, and Martin; and now also Sanderson. I read 'The Way of Kings' before this, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I like this book even more.  The magic-system used in this novel is very unique, and allows for a lot of creativity. To me, the magic system alone makes the book worth reading.  What sets Sanderson apart from other fantasy writers I've encountered, is that he brings religion into the fantasy (new, interesting religions); and while he doesn't focus on them a great deal, it is clear that the characters in the book are continuously partaking, or at least interested in religions. This really adds to the realism of the novel.  I found the story to be good, and importantly, realistic. There are several plot twists to keep you interested.  I enjoyed the characters; although few were fully fleshed out, those that were, are interesting and relatable.  The writing is pleasant, and doesn't distract from the story; though I don't find myself admiring the writing as I sometimes do when reading Rothfuss.  All in all, it's a great read.  (I read this at age 21, and I would recommend this to readers age 15+, maybe even 13+; notably there is some violence,and although it's not described in detail, it can be somewhat grotesque).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have evernote on my iPhone, Kindle Fire &amp; laptop. It's so much easier than having post it notes everywhere. I recommend this for note takers everywhere!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I've been using this app for about month and I love it. Splashtop is a great product Minimal visual lag and the audio is synched perfectly. My only problem with it is the fact that it doesn't format the resolution to city desk across the screen of my kindle, so I am constantly. zooming in and out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game play and easy to see good visual has good game speed easy for kids to play to...just good
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok.... I like some of the games. I think its dumb how u have to unlock the games so you can play them. still its fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I.love to play this game with my friends and get lots of points to spend &amp; get new games to play
B0054JZC6E|4.0|challenging &amp; fun variety of games. not too difficult, very entertaining. some are definitely tricky &amp; take several attempts to master.
0140120416|3.0|I'm reviewing my college Russian and was looking for a comprehensive text to get me up to speed.  Now I am appreciating just how superior my previous texts were. This approach is too simplified, teaching things in a very disjointed way, without giving basics of grammar, phonology, etc. I understand that the author does not want to make things too complicated, but Russian is sufficiently complex grammatically for English-speakers that your introduction should be rigorous and systematic. Here the author is trying to ease self-learners into the language. But I'm not sure that's the most effective way to learn.  Also too many references to non-Russian names, cities, etc., apparently in an attempt to make learners feel at ease. But how often am I going to be speaking to Russian-speakers about Brighton or Bristol, as opposed, say, to Pskov or Novgorod.  I'll get through this and back up to speed, but I wonder if the average student wouldn't just get frustrated.  Also more work on writing should be done up front. Students should feel absolutely comfortable with the alphabet before they delve into language studies.  I wish I hadn't tossed my old Russian textbooks. Oh well.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app doesn't support streaming from a Linux desktop. A travesty in the Android world! There's not much else to say. Its a pretty useless app.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy straight forward game.  My only complaint is you can go through the cards as many times as you want.  There are no real boundaries.
0780021150|4.0|This German film (originally 1931) is reputed to be the first about a serial killer. It involves killing young girls en route home from schools, and that part is disturbing. The strange and unreal portion involves the truly amateur efforts of the police - eg. no efforts to detect commonalities among the three killings, and their sweeps and searches are absolutely clueless. The intriguing portion involves the underworld's banding together to catch the killer because they're tired of being caught up in all the police search activity. Eventually a blind balloon vendor identifies the perpetrator through his whistling, his friends follow the killer and notify the underworld, and they find him in the attic of an office building after it closes. They then take him to an abandoned factory and are in the midst of a trial when they police show up. The film ends with real judges returning to their court, presumably with a verdict that we don't get to hear. Definitely different.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun I love how you have to earn points. only.thing is. I wish u didn't have to get to 4000 points
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Thought I was buying a quality product. What a disappointment! Followed the directions to detail looking forward to its use only to discover the watch would not turn on after the completed charge time. Explained it detail to Garmin (along with account set-up). Now must provide more information to try and get a RA number, seems they don't make it easy to obtain a working device. Not cool giving your wife a Christmas gift that does not work.
0312641893|5.0|Judging by the comments I've read when I mentioned reading this one, it has LOTS of buzz!  Since I try my darndest not to read other reviews before I'VE had a chance to read a review book, I can only go my own feeling on this one and say, \\"Well deserved!\\".<br /><br />I read this in one LONG sitting (which left me very tired the next day - I should learn not to start a new book for my nightly read).<br /><br />Linh Cinder is a 16-year-old mechanic at New Beijing's weekly market.  Her guardian, Adri, relies on Cinder's income to pay her own bills and those of her own two daughters, Peony (14) and Pearl (17).  Adri's husband Garan adopted the orphan Cinder when she was five and soon after contracted letumosis, a deadly \\"plague\\" for which there is no cure.  Adri resents Cinder and, as in the old fairy tale, finds reasons NOT to allow her to go to the royal ball.  Peony is Cinder's only human friend, but she also has a great sidekick named Iko, a witty android/<br /><br />Kaito (Kai), the Crown Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth, the heartthrob of many a teenage girl, comes incognito to Cinder's market stall to ask her to fix his android Nainsi.  Kai's mother died of the plague, and now his father, the Imperial Majesty Emperor Rikan, has contracted the disease.  Cinder is not starstruck like most girls, and Kai takes a liking to her.  Cinder knows it would never work, because she is a cyborg as a result of the hovercraft accident that killed her parents.  Cyborgs are considered less than human, treated as property, and there is even a draft for cyborgs for testing for a plague antidote.<br /><br />Then comes a tale that mixes a bit of steampunk with a bit of dystopia and science fiction.  A kick-butt heroine, a handsome prince, an abusive adoptive mother, a doctor determined to find a cure for the plague, villains in the form of \\"Lunars\\" who evolved from an Earthen moon colony centuries ago and now have the power to manipulate people's minds - all combine to create this wonderful roller coaster of a ride through a wonderfully-drawn, realistic world.<br /><br />I seriously wanted to SLAP Adri in so many places throughout this book.<br /><br />I figured out a central theme early on, but that didn't stop me from reading on.<br /><br />The villain, the Lunar Queen Levana, is spot-on creepy and manipulative.<br /><br />The romantic aspects are appropriately timed, which, sadly, doesn't happen in a lot of YA.<br /><br />Cinder is a girl that will make you root for her.  You'll smile at Iko's sarcasm, gnash your teeth at Adri's actions, hope against hope that Cinder will be on time for ... (oops, can't tell you, THAT would be a spoiler for sure).<br /><br />In short, even if you're not a YA/sci-fi/steampunk reader, you'll still like this book, because it's a story about a girl who doesn't fit in, but has not let her spirit be broken.  She has dreams and the will to make them happen, as well as the smarts to figure out how to do it.<br /><br />This is the first in a series by a debut author, and will likely be on my list of 2012 faves at the end of the year.  Buy it, borrow it, definitely read it.<br /><br />QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy):<br /><br />And the prince did know her now, sort of.  He had been kind to her at the market.  Perhaps he would ask her to dance.  Out of politeness.  Out of chivalry when he saw her standing alone.<br />The precarious fantasy crashed down around her as quickly as it had begun.  It was impossible.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have tried other remotes / VNCs etc.  Nothing works as well as Splashtop.  Mac - Windows whatever ... Splashtop does it all.  I have this on my iPod Touch and HP Touchpad as well.  Works so well I can watch Netflix through it and it is still watchable.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
1591844096|2.0|This is a business book for the Twitter and blogger generation:  Namely, for those who no longer have an attention span of no more than 2 seconds, and who relentlessly jump from topic to topic.  For those of us who actually do have attention spans and like our books well-written and well-argued this book is really hard to take.  The basic premise of the book is that if you're indispensable -- if you are talented, if you don't complain, if your work adds value to the company -- then you are indispensable.  So, in today's ultra-competitive economy, if you're the 1% you're in luck -- if not, then good luck!

0143118757|4.0|There are no secrets to negotiating, but it is an art form.  You need to exercise total self-control, suppress your ego, and focus on the task at hand.  You need to empathize with the side you're negotiating with, and figure out how to best arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement.  You need to hold firm, while at the same time understanding that reaching an agreement is what's important, and that ultimately everything can and need be sacrificed in order to reach an agreement, because the consequences of not reaching an agreement are unbearable -- and that takes a firm hold of reality.    None of this is particularly surprising to anyone with any negotiating experience (which is to say anyone with any experience), but what this book does is offer a systematic overview of good negotiating technique.  Where this book lacks is good story-telling and examples -- as readers we need lots and lots of examples in order to make the lessons here concrete and memorable.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is hilarious...Will Ferrell is outstanding...he is believable and he is so totally sincere in his performance...Bob Newhart is awesome as always...worth the price.
1594481717|3.0|The ideas and arguments in \\"A Whole New Mind\\" are sound and useful, but the formulation and presentation are much too simple and annoying.  In Daniel Pink's understanding, people are divided into left-brainers (logic, analytical, data-driven) and right-brainers (emotional, intuitive, and empathic).  While the left-brainers, or the \\"knowledge workers,\\" dominated economically for decades, eventually the right brainers (the empathic creatives) will come to dominate because of \\"abundance, Asia, and automation.\\"  Those who have a practical aesthetic sense (design), who can translate ideas and data for consumption (story), who can see the big picture and spot patterns (symphony), who can emotionally connect with others and help others to connect with each other (empathy), who know how to balance work and play to be more creative (play), and who can find meaning in their lives and bring purpose to the lives of others (meaning) will be invaluable in the future economy.    Daniel Pink's glib and gimmicky ideas just are not backed up strongly by science and logic.  In fact, the science tells us that emotions are in fact the basis for logic, and so it's impossible to be logical without first being emotional.  There is no left-brain and right-brain -- there's a brain, and those that use it to its fullest potential will thrive wherever and whenever they happen to be.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Received item in great condition. Will be back to buy more movies here. I need to get the first 3 seasons too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is one of best apps ever. It provides hours of fun for all ages. Awsom awesome awesome amazing app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are simple and repetitive. entertaining for a few mins but you have to play the same games.over and over to get points.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I like the game but its a little challenging for me...5 stars if you can bring it down a notch.
0062082353|2.0|First let me say I have high praise for Chris and what he did for his brothers in arms.  My problem with his book was the 3rd grade writing style and lack depth in painting a visual picture. I'm sure the movie will be a rare case where it will be better than the book.  I listened to the audio book while at work and the voice talent was unbearable at points. He made Chris sound like some inbred hillbilly. His story needed to be told but this book and audio has done him a great disservice. I could only recommend this book to boys between the age of 10-14yrs and only if their parents are ok with some salty language.
0240815807|5.0|Just got this book yesterday, It's cool. Teaches you simple things that make big differences, it even has has links to his website you can go to for examples. Definatley a good book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Perfect app for my Kindle Fire. I didn't know this was even an option! Great to use for meetings. I can't wait to use it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|These games are so much fun when you are bored and stressed. Releasing the birds is so much fun! Waiting rooms, bed confinement it works to entertain!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Just an excellent, excellent movie.  I had already watched it at the theatre, but decided to order it for my family to watch during the holidays.  Kudos to the producer of this film
B0054JELS4|2.0|The show itself is great, however, the discs are not.  Season 1 had two discs labeled wrong so we watched the shows out of order.  Disc 1, 2 and 5 have subtitles that we cannot find a way to stop.  Subtitles are distracting so that you read the words vs watching the show.  Season 5 disc 1, the video and audio skips, we missed half the dialog, disappointing.  I like the show so I am going to try to get the bad discs replaced. Not sure if anything is wrong with seasons 6-8.
B005GVF95O|4.0|This is a good app if you have young children or you have a niece or nephew you want to keep occupied. The puzzles are too easy for children over four or so.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This replaced my swype keyboard a while ago.  It it so much easier and doesn't get my words wrong nearly as often as swype would.  Would recommend this to just about anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I couldn't put the book down from the moment I picked it up. Sure. It may be a little slow at the very beginning but it picks up quickly. The characters are mysterious and complex, but very easy to like. This is the best book I've read in a long time, probably the best I've ever read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just love this Bible app.  Really has helped to keep my soul fed.  Not that it is something new and improved, but that it is readily available.  Blessed is the person or persons who God has filled to create it!  :)
0553801473|1.0|GRRM seems to be able to start hundreds of threads but never weave them into any kind of a believable tale.  Again we are left hanging with all characters in a desperate situation, but no resolution.  Any world with this many problems would simply collapse.  While this series is a fantasy, there has to be some thread of believable reality in it.  GRRM has completely missed on this one.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|great find at this price, bought to complete a Audrey Hepburn collection, had already seen the movie so no surprises here.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is a great way to pass the time. it is so simple yet so intricate. Also the soundtrack is fantastic. I recommend this application for anyone and evreyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an incredible book well worth the read, for those with the negative views against killing what did you think you purchased an autobiography written by a Navy Seal sniper.  Keep up the great work.  Semper Fi
B005TBWN0K|5.0|It is fun to play with and then share the pictures! I am still trying to figure it all out. I like it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Easy to use and lots of versions. Love the reading plans. Sends reminders and allows for easy note taking.
0060899190|5.0|I originally bought this book as a quirky coffee table book and ended up putting it away. A few years later, I was going through a difficult time and picked it up again. I was hoping to be distracted for a short time, and ended up feeling consoled. I felt compassion for those who suffered and smiled at those with humor. In the end, I felt like I wasn't alone, that we all harbor some form of pain. This book is completely engaging in its honesty and some of the artwork is very impressive. It makes a great gift for any occasion, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is facing problems in their lives; it may sound like an odd choice, but it can provide comfort to get through another day.
0471463396|5.0|This book is great. Many examples of Greenwald´s methodology and the right way to invest your money in value ang growth companies.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a good cheap set for all the Harry Potter movies!!  It comes in a hard plastic binder which all of your disc snap into.  Some DVD's have graphics but some dont.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great game! I play it almost everyday! I make sure before I'm done I unlock another game or finish!
B000NQRE0K|1.0|Me and my friends all went out and got haircuts just like Mels's just after this movie came out. Chicks dig it! Expecially canine chicks.  Mel is a awlsome actor and an even gooder inhumaniarianism. I gave it one star, cause this is the one movie that aspirated me to become a actur.
6304711891|5.0|This is a great video.  Cage and Connery both give stellar performances.  The chase scene is one of the best since \\"Bullit\\".
B003L77G06|5.0|We have really enjoyed watching the second season of Modern Family.  Got a great price and was shipped and received promptly.  My daughter loves this gift.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book because I had heard many good reviews and it has sat at the top selling list for a while. I had no expectations at first but was quickly blown away. Could not put it down and had it finished in a day and about to start the second.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Been holding off on getting this because of the price and how much I would really need it. For today its the free app on the Amazon store and is just my luck! Its great, runs pretty smooth. Great if you want to access something from your Pc quickly.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Must see movie! Story is well told and right to the point of what the women when thru. Shows the nasty-nice bullying that women do so gracefully. I wish all to see and understand and fight against that kind of abuse-bullying.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a great game I love it its the best game in the world I would play it all day if I could
0575102489|1.0|After really enjoying THE WAY OF KINGS, THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE I was interested in reading the second book.  I looked all over and found this one.  Part Two.  I ASSumed it was the natural progression from book one.<br />Wrong.<br />It is a reprint of the first book in smaller paperback form.<br />Im not sure why the author and publisher thought this was necessary unless it was to make more sales on the same pages I already owned in the first book.<br />Very annoying and makes me not trust future issue from either of them.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I jumped feet first into this book after reading about how the author collected thousands of vintage photographs and created the story around them. I thought it was such a creative idea and I love the use of the photographs within the book. The story line was interesting and engaging. I did find the narrator to sound quite a bit older sounding than his teenage years however, it did not detract from the story itself for me. This book is very clearly not for younger children. I would say at least 13 and up. There is a quite a bit of swearing and adult concepts in the book. No sex however, there are some angst-ridden monster scenes. I admit I did not actually read this Kindle book on my Kindle as I wanted to be able to see the pictures better than the black and white of my Kindle would allow. I read it on my Xoom tablet's Kindle app and I was even able to enlarge the photos for clearer viewing. They really are wonderful old pictures! Had I not been able to use an actual computer to read this particular book I may well have gotten the hardcover however, being able to enlarge the pictures was perfect. Anyway, If you like young adult fiction with plot twists and somewhat mystical beings this is the book for you. Without giving away the ending, I am sincerely hoping the author writes a sequel soon!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my 13 and 10 year old boys after seeing it on an Amazon Lightning Deal but knowing nothing about it. My kids knew nothing about it either and gave me a funny look when they opened it since they weren't sure what to make of it. I was also worried they wouldn't have the patience to keep at it. By later that night they were arguing over how much time each could have with it before having to share it with the other. My 13 year old brought it with him everyday on our vacation to the pool where all the other kids also took a shot at it and asked their parents to buy it for them. My wife joked that my 13 year old should get a commission from the manufacturer because he's helping make a lot of sales for them. He loves it and is the one who told me to rate it 5 stars. It's also great because it's portable and it's not an electronic game. My kids can't get past step 47 or so yet out of 125 or so steps, but they keep working on it.  It is not easy and is not for little kids who will get frustrated easily. As for durability, I've warned my kids not to throw it or drop it as it seems obvious that the parts inside could get damaged.  That being said, they haven't played with it with kid gloves either and it has held up for 2 weeks now, including in car rides and one plane ride kept under the seat by my son's feet and being packed into his carry on.  I would highly recommend this toy unless your child is one who gets easily frustrated or would be prone to tossing it around like a ball.
B001AQO446|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift and he was very happy with it. He finally bought a blu-ray player a few months ago so this was the natural choice. It is one of his all time favorite movies and why not? Where else can you find great singing, neo nazis, scary nuns, epic car crashes and Ray Charles?? Only here!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this! Everyone in the family has found a game to play and even our 3yr old autistic son has one or two he likes!
B00475BUVM|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHY A LOT OF REVIEWERS ARE HATING ON THE 3D IN THIS MOVIE.  THIS IS WHY BASKIN AND ROBIN HAS 31 FLAVORS... NO ONE FLAVOR WILL APPEAL TO  EVERYONE. HAVING SAID THAT, I LIKED THE MOVIE AND LOVED THE 3D. I REVIEW-  YOU DECIDE.
0439023513|4.0|I'm a middle aged man, not a young adult female, but I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in the Hunger Games Series, by Suzanne Collins. The third book, MOCKINGJAY, opens where CATCHING FIRE left off. With the Hunger Games arena in disarray, Katniss has been whisked off to District 13 while Peeta has been captured by the Capitol.<br /><br />In District 13, Katniss must come to terms with her new role as the MockingJay, the symbolic leader of the rebellion. She is close to Gale and her family now, but terribly misses Peeta and fears for her life. Her sole purpose in life, even if it means losing hers, is to kill President Snow.<br /><br />The first two books were great, and this book offers a fine conclusion to the series. However, it isn't near as good as the first two, and I'll try and explain why I thought so.<br /><br />This book tells an epic story of rebellions and battles, and that isn't Collins' strength. The first two books focused on characters in intimate settings amidst the Hunger Games. But this book's scope is broad, and the story suffers because of it. Many times, short paragraphs are used to describe massive events, pulling the reader away from the story.<br /><br />The final capitol battle is the best part of the novel, but before that, too much time is spent below ground in District 13. The novel needed another epic event, like the Hunger Games of the first two books, to be its focus. This is one book I think will make a better movie. This is a book I liked, but didn't love like the first two.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|THE 3D IS GOOD, BUT THE TITLE IS MISLEADING.  THIS DOCUMENTARY IS ALL ABOUT WATER CONSERVATION,   HOW WE'RE GROWING TOO FAST IN THE WEST, AND   HOW WE NEED TO \\"HEAL\\" THE COLORADO RIVER.  WHAT CAN I SAY. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  MY 5STAR RATING TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE PRICE.
0007374798|5.0|If you only ever buy one cake book this has to be it! I have made cupcakes in the past but theyve never been amazing. I just made the sticky toffee cupcakes and Im absolutely amazed everyone of them is perfect, light and they taste amazing. I have never been moved enough by a book to write a review but this one is certainly it. I bought it on kindle to read on my fire - the pictures are perfect and its easy to read. Next to make are the gingerbread cupcakes although maybe could be chocolate, there are so many beautiful but seriously easy recipes here. I have a kitchenaid so i suppose its just 'point and go' but it really was super easy with delicious results. Thank you Hummingbird Bakery.
B004APVI1G|5.0|THE MOVIE IS GOOD. THE MESSAGE IS GREAT.<br />THE 3D IS EXCELLENT. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY...<br />BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just enjoy playing this game.it relaxes me an hour will go by and I don't even believe I've played that long. thanks for the fun !
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have a kindle fire and this game works great on it!  its so addictioning and fun to play! A must have.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a very handy app. I especially appreciate the ease of navigation and the ability to compare passages in different translations. The audio of the NLT is an enjoyable listen.  DISAPPOINTMENT: The inability to search for a word or phrase when offline is what prevents me from giving this app 5 stars. However, I am pleased with their customer service...I sent an email asking about this issue and actually received a response! They said that it may work in some future update, but for now it won't because of how the Bibles are stored on the devise.   I think it's pretty amazing that a free app even has a customer service!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|works great on kindle fire. wish the color squares marking what u have going on that day were bigger and there were alerts/reminders that pop up. but I just got this app and already I use it every day! it is a must have to keep organized in a simple way! love it!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good wait to kill some time. fun mini games to play every now and then. don't like how you have to win coins to unlock games.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I have not seen a better Planet of Apes movie since the original. I thought the CGI ape was real until he started talking. The story was not the best and dragged on too much in some parts. Overall , great movie with great actors. I can't wait for the next movie (great cliffhanger)
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Again, this was the second part of a requested Christmas gift so I know the person is happy with the movie and I believe the DVD works since I have not heard any negative feedback regarding the DVD.
B0060ZJ74O|3.0|I thought it moved slowly in the beginning. This movie was ok, but I was expecting much more since I'm a big sports fan.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and since I have not heard any negative feedback regarding the workings of the DVD, I am assuming it is working and the movie was a request.
B005GVF95O|5.0|I downloaded this app when is was the free app of the day. I showed it to my 2 year old son on my Kindle Fire and he sat down and played everything single puzzle three or four times.<br /><br />There is a good mix of extremely simple puzzles (like moving an entire penguin or snake piece into a slot), all the way to one big octopus with 5 - 6 pieces. I would recommend this to any parent that likes to share games on their devices with their kids.<br /><br />The controls are fairly simple and puzzles can be reset just by shaking the device. When you are moving a piece the game \\"helps\\" put it in the right place when you get close enough. Absolutely great for kids still learning motor skills.<br /><br />Great app, will check out more by these developers.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't have this app nor did i ever download this product. Why this even showed up in my product review section is beyond me and for that reason along i give it one star and would give it zero if possible for even ending up there.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was scared to get a case for my Fire considering how hefty the tablet itself is compared to the Kindle E-Readers. This is the best I have seen. I have shopped and shopped and been scared of all of the bad reviews but this is the case to buy.<br /><br />It is made out of a hard plastic shell with a softer rubberized coating. It has a front flap that is heavy duty plastic on the outside and soft felt against the screen. It has openings for all of the charging ports and both speakers are uncovered. It has an elastic strap to hold the cover closed.<br /><br />As for the stand part, I haven't used it at length as a stand but I have tried it a few times and it worked fine every time. It isn't a rock solid locking case but it is sturdy enough to use to watch movies and things like that.<br /><br />I'd recommend this case to anyone looking for protection without much added weight.
B005HSL626|1.0|I don't have facebook nor did i ever download this product. Why this even showed up in my product review section is beyond me and for that reason along i give it one star and would give it zero if possible for even ending up there.
1416987118|5.0|I didn't grow up with this book/camp song but I remember my aunt talking about it.  My 4 year old is very into songs and rhythms, and things he can participate in.  This book is very easy to make up little gestures to go with the story/song, and it makes it a lot of fun.  It's fun for me as well as him, actually.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I have read quite a few books in my time, and many of them have been sub par. I'm very picky with the books I read. However, this book struck a chord that I cannot forget. This book is written superbly. The emotions are real and the story is touching. I highly recommend this book, even to the most particular readers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Challenging, fun and free. Worth the download. A Lot of different games to play and unlock. Just keep winning to get enough points to buy the locked games.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Wasn't at all what I expected!  Too much drama and love story not enough shootin aliens, like I hoped.  Wish I had of rented instead of bought!
B0009P5YXO|3.0|We loved this as a gift for our daughter for Christmas. Opened it on Christmas morning, installed the batteries and no sound came out. Took it apart again, put the batteries in again.Still no sound. We love the infrared pen feature and the telescoping action but disappointed that the sound doesn't work. The tough part is we had to wait til it was opened and then it was to late.
B005NQ94LM|4.0|Despite the mixed reviews, I think this movie is worth watching at least once. I actually liked the movie and ordered it so I could watch it again. I thought it was a good story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|perfect app for the whole family your kids will enjoy playing the many games and you will to even your pet will enjoy them ha ha
B004RC8NXI|4.0|When I first started watching this movie, I almost shut it off. In the beginning, the movie kind of seems pointless. However, I'm glad I kept watching it, because it turned out to be a pretty good movie with a good story. I would recommend.
0312641893|4.0|Unique retelling of Cinderella- combo Sci-fi, dystopian, fairy tale, Steampunk= completely original!<br />One star deducted for flat romance- it was pretty much Insta-luv/Insta-crush<br />Otherwise well done.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I really liked this movie, mainly because it was different from any other movie I've seen. The story is told in a very interesting way and keeps the viewer interested throughout the entire movie. I would definitely recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a really great tool to have at your disposal. I'm using one of the daily devotionals and love it. I reccomend this app.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|I haven't been impressed by a lot of the comedy movies lately, but this one was a different story. I laughed the entire movie! I would definitely recommend this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the game its hours of endless fun I get new games every single day there simple and fun its fantastic
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I am a techie, which made this movie especially appealing. I would definitely recommend this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! I downloaded this for both my fire and aneroid..it keeps me entertained and is worth the download!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I have watched this movie a million times and never get tired of it! The acting is incredible and the movie is truly a great story. It definitely touches the viewer's heart. If you have not seen the movie, you have to watch it. You won't regret it!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|ColorNote is a perfect app for me. I use it for grocery lists, and to keep track of anything I might want to look up later. I like the different colors because I make separate to-do lists for daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term tasks. The simplicity of this app is what makes it so useful, I think. It doesn't need a bunch of extra features.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I have watched this movie hundreds of times and never get tired of it. I think this movie has something for almost every viewer and is appealing to a wide range of audiences.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is additive and well worth 5 stars but you have to leave room for improvement. I find myself playing this instead of reading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are more challenging than I initially thought...you got yo earn points to unlock.the games but the accumulation is pretty quick.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is by far the best app ive downloaded ever. it works flawlessly on my Fire and completely changes the game of the Kindle. worth every penny if you had to pay for it. luckily today it was free!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is an awesome app on the kindle fire!! I love it!!! Would like to see some different backgrounds and some more card backs.....but overall it's a pretty good solitaire app. I could play for hours...
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I received my Kindle Fire today along with this Marware case.  I'm very happy with the case so far.  It was easy to snap onto the Kindle Fire.  I am pleased with it's lightness since I didn't want to add any more weight to the Kindle Fire than is already there.  Is it the most sturdy case you'll find?  No.  But it is practical and if you plan to carry your case inside a bag, it's perfect.<br /><br />The exterior is rubberized and easy to clean off.  The inside cover is soft to protect the screen.  An elastic band loops around the Kindle and cover to keep the flap closed when not in use and it's also handy to help keep a grip on the Fire while reading.<br /><br />The built in stand is functional and useful for movie play.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this case and at $29.99 I find it to be a good value for my money.
B0062A5RUA|4.0|I have seen Slash many times over the years, all the way back when GnR opened for AeroSmith.  Huge fan.  The vocals are a little hard in spots but the music itself is top notch.  Really enjoying the LP.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I got it for my kindle fire and worked for a while but now when I go to play a video it says video not avalible! I don't know what's wrong! :b
B004OBQQPY|5.0|This is a superbly crafted documentary that manages to tell a moving and compelling story with remarkable restraint. It is a testament to the Director and Editor's skills that they are able to create a cohesive story line, convey subtle emotions and paint vivid characters and relationships while using only historical footage and with no \\"talking head\\" interviews at all.<br /><br />As a professional video editor myself, I found this to be an astonishing feat the likes of which I've never really seen before. There are no overarching VO helping us to understand the political nuances or emotional tension in a scene and no cuts to interviews that interpret or reinterpret the scenes. In this regard, it is a work that never insults the intelligence and leaves an even more favorable impression because history and the facts speak quite eloquently for themselves.<br /><br />Like many reviewers here, I am not a racing afficiando and frankly had only the most cursory awareness of Senna and the F1 racing world, but I am certainly a fan of high-quality filmmaking and this is one of the finest documentaries I've ever seen. I consider it a work of true genius and any student of producing or editing should carefully study and learn from this stunningly beautiful work. It is a remarkably intelligent and powerful film. Bravo.
B00004RD54|4.0|This is a good show of Lou Reed and his great band. But don't forget to buy \\"Lou Reed Live\\" that is the rest of the show. I didn't forget for 30 years when Lou Reed sings \\"ahh  visciouss!!!\\" in the song \\"Viscious\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a good app for when ur bored. really fun and challenging. I would really recommend this to a friend. good job.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is a must have!!! I have been more diligent and accountable since adding it to my Kindle Fire. Looking forward to tomorrow night's scripture reading. God's word is Awesome!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. I have almost completed all levels of the game.I enjoy this game a lot. thanks :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app is really solid. no force close, and my home computer reacts instantly to the commands given from my phone. HTC EVO 3D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is really good and I would get it if it were paid. I think anyone who likes games should get this.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|This has the makings of a really cool tool.  However, it won't work for my application. My corporate laptop is set to log me out as a user after a certain amount of time.  Currently, there is no way to enter my windows ID/login remotely.  Using the keyboard function within the app on my phone, it appears to be typing the password in.  However, it will not login this way.  Searched the web help and found the following:  [...]    Maybe this feature will be added in the future or maybe I just missed something. Either way, I really wish I could make it work.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All you sooth-sayers are totally WRONG!!!  This Blu-Ray edition is awesome. Colors are more vibrant, scenes are better in texture and exposure...the shadows are cleaner...only two 'sounds' added and they enhance rather than detract. No 4 suns on Tatooine, only 2....that was a hoax as most of the bad ratings are. Whose movies are these?  GL, and he can do whatever he wants. Kudos to you George!  They are masterpieces!!  I highly recommend!!!
B00005JLR2|5.0|I was happy to find this video.  The kids had been asking for it for a couple Christmas' in a row.  The seller was quick to get it to me.  It was not guaranteed to be here for Christmas but it arrived in plenty of time.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Not worth waiting for it to go free app of the day. Buy it now, and you won't regret it. Plenty of relaxing mental puzzles ahead.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great remote desktop for Kindle Fire.  Best FAOTD in a long time.  Set up is straightforward and connection simple.  I highly recommend this App if you want access to your PC when you are away from it.
0385535139|1.0|A bunch of crap. Just plain awful with horrible characters (except David his wife and Rochelle), including the dog. Once again I have been blindsided by the name of another great author. But you know what, if you build your rep I guess you can put out whatever you want and get paid. His worst novel to date; especially when my money is sooooo tight. Lessons learned and I must continue to watch the hype; especially in publishing for sooooo many are getting with murder with their talents.   It is my fault though for being thirsty for great writing. I won't give up though. I am hoping and believing in new talented and gifted writers of any genre who do not rest on their laurels and if honest with themselves, DO NOT take advantage of their adoring public. Maybe they will get a chance, instead of these world renowed authors putting out crap and wasting my time. Taking an alka selzter was more pleasing than reading this book. Hey, the rich get richer with little work; but some of us will get smarter on who and what we spend our money on.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game has a good assortment of quick and fun games. The adds can be a bit annoying but otherwise a fun free title.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is a great antenna and it hurts to see some people having difficulty using it with their navigation programs. 90% of the problems are caused by your software needing a different Baud rate than the default settings. You can change the Baud rate using windows control panel-devices. Depending on which windows version it can be listed under Ports, USB devices or some other weird place, but once you find it and click on it, click on Port settings and it is simple to choose any speed. Many programs use 4800 Baud which was not the default. Good luck.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a nice sleek cover for my kindle fire.  It does what its suppose to do without adding a lot of bulk.  I gave it four stars because the inside microfiber attracts all types of lint and it is very hard to remove.  Overall, I like it enough to keep it as long as I make sure there's nothing hard stuck on the fiber to damaged the screen that it's suppose to be protecting.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works like a charm!!! Worth every penny, ton of fun!!! Easy to use. Easy to run, just plain easy. I don't know what else to say.
0553386794|5.0|This book deserves the hype it gets. The characters ring true and the plot is awesome. Start reading this series: you won't regret it.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|Works great.  I like to leave my iPhone charging at my bedside on my iHome clock/radio.  I have a Ballistic SG case, and the phone wouldn't fit on the iHome dock with the case on.  This adapter solved the problem!  I do see what the other reviews mean about the weight of the iPhone.  It tips back a bit when you set it on the adapter, but it still seems stable.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for one reason:  I do think it's overpriced.
0446547654|5.0|[[ASIN:0446547654 The Best of Me]]  Although this basic story line  theme may have been used before , only Nicholas Sparks can put the thoughts of the characters into words so \\"down to earth descriptive\\" that the reader can actually feel it themselves.  I loved this novel and quickly became immersed  in it.  The fact that it often paralleled my own life in many ways surely helped me to not want to put it down...
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is the best movie. It probaby wouldn't hold a small child's attention because it is not a fast moving story. But it will make you cry. If you like animals...especially dogs...you will love this movie.  I got it for both of my grown children.  It will definately tug at your heart.<br /><br />Too sad for anyone that has a dog already.  Both of my boys and my daughter-in-law said it was too sad and asked me not to give them a movie like this again.<br /><br />I loved the movie myself.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Works internally like VNC, only too sluggish to use. If it were actually realtime, it would be great, but.  Video \\"strobes\\" beyond use.  Processor drags entire computer to a crawl, it took 2 minutes just to open a browser.  Works externally like Logmein or similar, but again, Splashtop is too sluggish to use.  Great Idea....  too bad it's not useful.  Logmein \\"Ignition\\" is clean for accessing your home computers from your phone or tablet when you're away, and VNC is clean and fast for lazing on your couch at home, and accessing your computers without getting up.  Using on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 with Honeycomb, and Samsung Fascinate with Froyo.  Streaming video at home to your tablet isn't feasible with VNC, but video on Splashtop doesn't even show up, although the sound does.  The demo video shows it working fine, but I suspect it's an iPad he's using.  When they fix it for Android, it'll be great, but right now it sux.
B005KELQEU|2.0|I like the case, overall. And the Kindle Touch does fit in it, if very snugly. And that is the problem, I guess. If I put the Kindle touch in it that way, I'll often find the unit on inside the case later because the power button sticks out just enough to be be triggered, thus wasting battery power. I get around this by leaving it unzipped near the button and that works...but it is really not a good fit. Or perhaps not a good design on the Kindle power switch...if it were a recessed switch, there would be no problem. And no, I don't have any packing material left inside. If it was just a tad longer, it would fit famously.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|GREAT MOVIE,ALL WOMEN SHOULD WATCH AND LEARN FROM IT..AFTER SEEING THIS,IT GAVE ME GREAT IDEAS ON WHAT TO DO WITH STUPID ,SLIMY MEN WHO RAPE WOMEN!!!!
0062082353|5.0|Chris and Taya were our next door neighbors for most of the time the events in this book were taking place.  While Chris has sanitized many of the events he was involved with, the book offers a seldom seen look into the trials and pains that American Forces, especially or SEALS endure along with their family and friends.  There are no politics in this book, just a saga of the human side of war and conflict.  For me it was a must read and for Chris, I'm sure it was way of purging nightmares and letting the public see that the men who protect us are just as human as we are.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a blast. it has so much to choose from and makes you stay busy. children as well as adults will love the variety of.games. love it
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This was a gift, so I am unsure as to the price, but I really like the material it is made of. It is easy to grip and hold onto. As far as the stand feature goes that is a bonus and works well. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this is the best keyboard ever. I have tried many but this one is the best and is on all my devices
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is ok! The points aren't hard to get. The games are simple and that is really my only complaint.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I wasn't sure about this series since it was targeted for teens, however I started the Hunger Games and, of course had to read the final 2 books. It is entertaining and compelling. Similar to the Twilight Series. The book was well written, the plot keeps you going and it was interesting as well. I would recommend this series to anyone who liked the Twilight Series of books. A good read and not boring at all.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|You have to really appreciate that Amazon offers a free app everyday even if sometimes it is not an app you will use.  But in this case Splashtop is absolutely awesome and is well worth the asking price.  In fact I installed it to try it out and it works so well I am planning to buy it for my work iPad as well.  I also use Teamviewer which is another great app, but I really like that Splashtop makes the interface on the laptop work more like the tablet touch interface where Teamviewer is more like a touchscreen mouse.  Splashtop also did quite well streaming video to my Xoom running fullscreen 1920x1080 on my laptop.  Get it free if you can and buy it if you miss it today.
B003L77G6A|2.0|I recieved this movie in a timely manner but discs 1 and 3 are making a horrible noice and play for a bit and stop, the discs look warped. I have tried emailing but no one responded. I would really like to return it and get what i paid for.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazingly simple to configure and use. Thank you amazon for making this free app of the day. Was able to control my home computer and was impressed to view both the monitors of my home desktop. Good job developers.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It was FREE, so I thought I would try it out... easy to set up and easy to use... nice to see what's happening at home when I am out and about with MY FIRE...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is super fun.  not only do my kids love it but I find myself playing it a lot.  the wide range of games it offers makes this be a non repetitious game. its also challenging.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty good app,but it would be fun if they gave you more money it would be great. Otherways it is a great app with fantastic birds.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good to kill some time but not a fun game. too many mini games which gives a poor experience. the dart game is very bad
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Maybe it's because I have a hi-res 24\\" monitor?   Or maybe it's because I have 3 monitors in use and it got confused?  I don't know but once I connected from my Droid X splashtop downgraded the resolution of my primary monitor, which is ok while it's doing it's thing, but after disconnect I moused to a different monitor and couldn't get back!  I had to reboot, and then all the icons were screwed up due to the resolution change by splashtop.  So... great idea and seems it works really well for most, but I elected to uninstall as it's completely unworkable for my setup.
B003L77GGU|5.0|The Supernatural series is awesome.  My husband and I enjoy watching this together.  We haven't finished watching the whole season but so far it is great.
0307959856|2.0|This book missed it's mark.  It was repetitious, as though the author had to be constantly reminded what the plot was herself.  The characters were  not true to their original Austen portrayal.  The plot was loose and not well structured.  The mood of the book seemed depressed and full of melancholy.  I feel that the review that I read in the newspaper was misleading.  I should have waited for Amazon reviews which seem more honest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have found no flows in this game. It is just like the game on my computer. Great way to use my mind while waiting for my kids to finish their activities or while watching TV.
B005HXGE9G|1.0|I purchased this 2CD Special Edition only to receive the voucher code for the high resolution download via the B&W Society of Sound website. After receiving a new and sealed version, there is no voucher nor are there instructions anywhere to be found on the net on what to do. This is very disappointing.
B005ZUR724|1.0|it says there is a problem installing it after reinstalling it to get the update :( what do I do????
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I love this amazing show! Came quickly in the mail and was mint condition upon arrival.  Thank you very much for the smooth transaction
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is FUN and entertaining and can keep you occupied for hours! the levels make you want to keep going to see how many games you. can unlock at a time. this game is amazing.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|I have an original Droid by Motorola so the problem might be the lack of memory on my phone or something, but it keeps crashing and now it won't start up at all.  I have powered off and restarted my phone a number of times and it still doesn't work.  For the few minutes when I could get it to work it seems like a great application.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game so far!  It is easy to understand, not confusing at all. Look forward to more games like this by this creator.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best Bible app I have ever seen and used injustice think its outstanding now if. I need a quick Bible now I have one way to go you version way to go
B0054JZC6E|3.0|simple short games only entertains for a short period the achievements are really easy to get and it doesn't take much skill
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great remote desktop app, it's easier to setup and works better than others I've used on my Asus Transformer.  Thanks Amazon for giving this great application to us for free.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The initial graphics and music are appealing. However after playing through a few levels it looses the appeal... there needs to be something to stimulate more excitement in the game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is very fun. this game is very addicting that ever since I came home I have played.so from my point of view this game is very fun and I recomend this game to anyone in the world.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this Anniversary edition of Annie though Amazon and it was in perfect/ new condition just as it was advertized and it is great.  thank you
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best Bible app on the market. Dozens of translations in several languages make this app a must-have.  But if that wasn't good enough, this app also has several reading plans, social networking functions and promises of more good things to come.  One suggestion...watch for opportunities to download the NIV and NLT translations for offline use. The window doesn't come along very often. You can still use those versions if you have Internet access.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great idea, and it works perfectly. You can use 3/4g or wifi to connect to your home or work computer.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|it does its job and that is all I should have spent more money on an upgrade the zipper could be much better
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun and interesting games. tub that you have to work to unlock all of the. one hundred and one games
B004O3YGMC|4.0|pretty good app.  it does what it says.   few minor gripes.  one, keyboard does not type in the URL bar of the browser. it remembers your last key press when you exit out and that's it. This bug needs to be addressed.  two, scrolling needs to be smoother and more intuitive. sometimes it recognizes the scroll as a zoom. annoying.  last but not least, security. needs an option to encrypt.   have tried few other remote apps and this is the only one that plays video correctly, if at all.   if they could fix a few minor bugs and things this could very well be it.   due to some of the issues I wanted to give it a 3 and 1/2 star but since amazon won't let me, 4 stars I guess.   pretty decent app, even with some of the issues.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Will not connect at all. Tried many things their website says to do and still not working. I wish Amazon would make sure their free paid apps actually work!
B005DOL0R0|4.0|The sleeve does a good job protecting my Kindle.  It gets tossed around a lot and the padding in the case does it's job well.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I am so glad that they put this show on DVD so I can watch it whenever I want, it's addictive!!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|not a true rdp application since you have to install their client software on the computer you want to remote control. still good since its free today. if you want a true rdp protocol application then download accesstogo
0439023521|5.0|I am not a \\"reader\\" by any means, but after a couple friends suggested this book (and the whole series) I decided to give it a try.  I plowed through the entire series in 5 days!  I could not put this book down and stayed up half the night to finish it.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Try it...I dare you not to like it.  May the odds forever be in your favor!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I'm not completely tech savvy on network stuff, so I was hesitant to even download this to try out. I'm so glad I did though because I cannot believe how simple this was to get up and running and connected to my desktop through my kindle fire! I have been toying around with this app off and on today, and it does everything it's supposed to do. I'm able to watch movies, play music, etc. seamlessly. I'm actually surprised at how great it works. If you are hesitant to download, let me tell.you, if I can run this, anyone can! Awesome awesome app!
B005KP7EK4|4.0|When I stumbled on this gem I had never heard of it.  I loved the concept.  While I know it's hard for people to enjoy western's these days this is a movie worth checking out.  I won't get into what it's about, they have a description for that.  What I will say as a fan of westerns it is very well done.  I like stories that take a real person from history and ask the question \\"What if?\\"
1600610234|3.0|Ok, this book is ok for the money, but is not a must have imo. The final results of the exercises are not master pieces by any means as some of Chiang work. And after following some examples, the others are pretty much the same stuff but with a diferent subject. It looks like he just put the minimun energy in this book to make it decent and to mantain his reputation, but i can´t see a great compromise for giving all the information he could. I might be wrong of course. So, don´t have big hopes with this books, and for 16 dollars is ok, you will learn some things.
B005HS00NW|5.0|What a fantastic album! It could have been a single disc, disc one as a stand-alone, but the second disc, when I get to it (I absolutely love disc one) is almost on par with the first.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|SPOILER- there is a hidden disc.............i called Amazon because i thought a disc was missing and they told me where the disc was. i did some minor damage to the packaging trying to find the disc but it IS there..........good luck. if you are careful you will do no damage
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best Bible App around. This app is very easy to navigate and the reading plans are great. Reccomemd for everyone.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|this application will not run, force closes instead. glad i didn't spend money on it. but sad it didn't work. it would have been useful. ZTE score
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble does it again!  This CD is one of the best Christmas collections ever.  Even songs that are not my favorites (\\"All I Want for Christmas Is You,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\") are covered in his style, with his seductive voice and outstanding arrangements and orchestration.  \\"Santa Baby,\\" with its lyrical adjustments for a male singer, is my favorite version of all time.  (Move over, Eartha Kitt and Madonna!).  As you can tell, I truly enjoy the Buble spin on these old favorites of the Christmas season.  Give the CD a listen---it will become one of your \\"go-to\\" albums to set the mood.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I have some high quality speakers driven by a good old analog amplifier, connected to my desktop computer. I was tired of 2 things:  - turning the computer on/off or resuming from stand by resulted in a POP sound in the speakers  - constant high frequency noise coming out of the speakers  This little marvel is very silent when idle, and since it has its own power supply, it is not affected by the computer power state. In order to avoid noise introduced by the source, make sure to use fiber optics, though, as an RCA cable might carry static noise through the ground.
B0067QPVD2|2.0|The special effects were well done and scary but the problem I had was the fact that the \\"alien\\" was intelligent enough to carry on a conversation, and even operate a freakin spaceship, yet it continued to act more like a wild tiger hiding and hunting!<br /><br />W.T.F.?<br /><br />We are a smarter audience and we deserve better. This movie does have its \\"entertainment\\" value but there was a much more interesting story that could've came of this and we didn't get it! It seemed geared toward, shall we say, a teenage audience. This movie is a poor follow-up to the original (circa 1980's).
B004O3YGMC|3.0|When I switched to Android, I had been using RDM+ on my BlackBerry for quite a while. Splashtop was one of the first that pretty much worked for me, especially since RDM+ didn't (at the time) have an Android version.<br /><br />The app is fairly easy to use. My main complaint is that I have pretty high resolution configurations for my desktops. Whenever Splashtop connects to either of my computers, the screen changes resolution and the icons are shifted all over the place. Any applications I have set up to take advantage of the higher screen resolutions don't get resized and end up getting cut off at the right end of the screen. This made it somewhat frustrating to use, especially after coming from an app that didn't have any of these issues. The highest setting I could find in Splashtop was 1024x768, which means my 1920x1280 screens get shifted.<br /><br />Connecting while on the same network is a breeze. I never had a problem connecting to either of my computers. Connecting from outside the network, over the internet, was an issue. This may be something they have worked on, but it wasn't very easy to work with routers and firewalls on my home network, or at my office. If you're connecting locally, there shouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />RDM+ finally came out with an Android version. It works over the internet without any issues, as well as working with my different screen resolutions (no screen or icon shifts). I don't use Slashtop anymore, although before RDM+ came out with their Android version, Splashtop was the best app I found. I think Splashtop is a good application. For basic connections, I think it is a fine product.
B005GVF95O|1.0|I don't like this app because it is the easyast game in the worldand it made me start the whole thing over and 14 puzzles its just not worth it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought a couple pairs of these headphones a long time ago. I like the over the head, in ear design. My only complaint would be that the plastic at the top seems a little flimsy and bendable for my liking. That's why I only give these headphones 4 stars. Like I say in my title though--for the price I can't complain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I put all my hard work in it lego Jesse my sis is do amoying lego. see you later
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews, I was wary about buying this for my boyfriend, but I figured it would at least be decent if it costs $30. It turned out to be nicer than I expected! The case fits snugly, and is very slim and light. The stand works fine and holds the Kindle Fire at a comfortable viewing angle. The elastic strap looked like it was attached securely.  So far, my boyfriend seems happy with it, and I was glad to see that I got my money's worth!  If you're looking for a sleek case at a reasonable price, this is it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it just keeps going for fun that never stops! Its game after game of pure excitement. just when you think your done it pops up another game! hours of fun for when you got notion better to do. reccomend.
0439023513|5.0|The third book in The Hunger Games finds Katniss, along with her family and Gale, living with the rebels in District 13. Katniss has no idea what has become of Peeta and fears he is dead. She unwillingly and reluctantly has become the symbol of the rebellion and the rebel leaders urge her to exploit this via video feeds to the 12 Districts. Katniss at first feigns infirmity but eventually caves in after negotiating an agreement with the rebel leaders that they will not harm Peeta or the other Hunger Games survivors if they assume leadership. Much as she was manipulated by the government, Katniss now finds herself in the same circumstance with the rebel leaders. When Peeta is rescued, Katniss is greatly relieved, but Peeta has been tortured and brainwashed to the point that he is no longer the same person. Katniss vows to kill President Snow for what he has done to Peeta and joins the rebels in trying to overthrow the government. When her chance comes to kill the president, Katniss does something unexpected that could lead to her death.<br /><br />Collins ruthlessly depicts the war between the Capitol and rebels in a grisly, violent fashion, leaving nothing to the imagination. Once again, she proves adept at peeling away layers of personas of pertinent characters. Katniss is portrayed as a young woman who wants to live a simple life and does not care for her perception as a heroic young woman ready to lead the cause for freedom yet finds herself thrust again and again into this role. The ending will surprise some readers, although this reviewer sees no other way it could have concluded.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|When I first seen this app I was kind of hesitant about using it.I'm glad i downloaded it. It really works as your fully functional desktop or laptop. This app is good for saving space on my kindle that I don't have to use for music,because I can just stream it from my laptop. I have used this app with a windows xp computer,and a windows 7 computer,I recommend windows 7,it seems to work faster and respond more accurately for the touchscreen.I love this app!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is ok. . saving up the points are a little frustrating. some games are super easy and pose no challenge,  but there are also some challenging ones.  t
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I ordered this item at Amazon USA and using it in Japan.   I find this watch very useful and would like to recommend for every runner,  but particularly middle to serious runner who runs more than 100km / month.   For me, it is great pleasure to \\"draw\\" running path on Google map every (other) day!  1. Installation of software  Maybe just because I did not read the instruction manual so much, first I downloaded   different USB driver and it took couple of hours before I figure out correct   software I should install is \\"ANT agent\\". Some people like me might install  \\"Gamin USB drive\\" instead.   2. Using GPS watch  In training mode locating satellite is rather swift. It usually takes 10 to 20 seconds  and much faster than it is written in manual. This is really good.  Accuracy is almost good, the running path stays on the right track about plus minus 5 m, I would say.  It have nylon belts (in two lengths) in addition to standard rubber belt and this helps for the   people like me with small wrist diameter.  3.Using heart rate monitor  You \\"must\\" wet the electrode, otherwise the GPS watch can not detect the monitor.   The belt fits me very well. It did not loosen or tighten after couple of hours running.  3. Using software   Gamin training center might not be so useful until you purchase additional map (which I did not)  default map is really \\"global scale\\" and you only roughly know your running location in nation scale.  Garmin connect, now they have Japanese language option and easy to use. I may suggest that Gamin connect  might have following option,  - to change vertical scale of graphs  - to have report function summarized in graph (distance ran in last 30days, particularly)   What I do not like this watch is using bezel touch to control the menu, like many people reports.  Is this using pressure sensor or what? I hope this function might be replace by a pair of mechanical   button.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Easy to moderately difficult Mahjong layouts make this a fun game. Initially this game was tarnished by random crashes but subsequent updates have solved the problem.  I would definitely recommend for Mahjong lovers.

B0011Z8RQW|5.0|If it wasn't for this band and album I wouldn't have get into rock music. Plus I was a teenager when Simple Plan released this album which motivate teenagers when they are having troubles like dealing with society, rejections, family drama, and etc. It been many years and every time I listen to their songs it remind me of when I was a teenager. Also old memories of when I was in high school. I still consider this album awesome.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I bought this album just AFTER Christmas, 2011, and I am still playing it in January, 2012.  I love this album!  But HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED YO KNOW:  If you feel that Christmas songs are about Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Andy Williams, and the Carpenters, this album is NOT for you.  You will hate it!  (See instead, Josh Groban's Noel and read my review.) Wintersong is the most unique Christmas album I have ever encountered.  It is anything but traditional.  I have come to appreciate Ms McLachlin's voice, as I suspect many have, from her ASPCA commercials.  She is like some ethereal yodeler, and I mean that as a compliment.  What you will find on this album are some traditional and modern Christmas songs and some songs about the winter season.  Not familiar with the winter songs, I have no way to say how they compare with other versions except to say I like all of Sarah's versions.  As for the Christmas songs, Ms Mclachlin sometimes stays close to the recognizable music and sometimes goes totally someplace else.  What Child Is This? (Greensleeves) has the usual lyrics but almost unrecognizable music.  Still, it's a wonderful version that is both familiar and strange at the same time.  Less successful, I feel, is The First Noel, the one song I dislike on this album.  Not only is the music unrecognizable but Sarah uses her voice like a bagpiper on steroids.  Despite what I feel is one bad track, the album is truly unique and amazing.  Her creative approach to the Christmas songs and her wonderful vocalization (with a little help from Diana Krall) make this the best Christmas album I've bought in many, many years!  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a break from the run-of-the-mill, standard renditions of Christmas songs.  ,

B003O5MO6G|4.0|Younger Than Yesterday was the first full Byrds album after Gene Clark left the group, and Chris Hillman was \\"promoted\\" to singer/songwriter to fill the gap. Hillman responded with five excellent songs, including co-writing the classic hit \\"So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star\\". \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" (a minor hit), \\"Thoughts and Words\\", \\"Time Between\\", and \\"The Girl With No Name\\" round out the best group of songs Hillman would ever write for a single album. David Crosby also stepped up with two of his better songs, \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" (certainly among his absolute best) and \\"Renaissance Fair\\", both also released as singles (b-sides). Other than co-writing/arranging \\"Rock and Roll Star\\" and \\"Renaissance Fair\\", McGuinn presents an interpretation of Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\" that matches (if not surpasses) the band's classic \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\".   Unfortunately, a few missteps prevents this album from being, perhaps, the Byrds best. Although the Crosby/McGuinn song \\"Why\\" is excellent, this version is not as enjoyable or adventurous as the raga-rock version released as the b-side to \\"Eight Miles High\\" almost a year before. \\"CTA 105\\" is less a compelling song than McGuinn's attempt at exploring special effects. The \\"martian voices\\" are somewhat funny on first listen, but become fairly annoying upon repeated listenings. The clear lowpoint to the album (and probably to the entire Byrds canon) is David Crosby's \\"Mind Gardens\\", which presents pretentious, hippy lyrics as a monotonous drone.   Had the Byrds decided to include \\"Psychodrama City\\", \\"I Know My Rider\\", and/or \\"It Happens Each Day\\" in place of the three less desirable songs, or at least replaced the one awful song, this album could have been an easy five-stars. As it is, it is still essential for the eight excellent songs - four and a half stars.
1400069181|5.0|I love TOMS shoes.  I'm not usually a trendy person.  As an Iowan, I stand little chance of being trendy.  We don't catch on to trends until the items are available on the shelves of Wal-Mart.  This is one trend, however, I did catch on to early.    The shoes are not only hip and fun but they are extremely comfortable.  They are like work appropriate slippers.  I am on my feet 8+ hours per day so I need a comfortable pair of shoes (or five).  I appreciate the TOMS movement.  Who wouldn't want to help out children while wearing cute and comfortable shoes? Brilliant.  As a loyal TOMS customer, I was excited to read more about the company.    \\"Start Something That Matters\\" is a quick, yet inspirational read.  The book discusses the origins of the company and the importance of using stories in today's marketing.  Would the alpargata inspired shoe have made such an impact in United States fashion without the one for one movement?  My husband and brother would definitely argue \\"no\\" because they do not like the style of shoe.  (Keep in mind they are dudes from Iowa. Iowa dudes are even less trendy than the lovely Iowa ladies.)    I'm a skeptic when it comes to self-help/inspiration business books.  Yes, it would be awesome to love your work and work for what you love but I'm not sure everyone can experience this.  Maybe there are people that LOVE being garbage men but I'm pretty sure the majority feel otherwise.  But garbage men are important and the world needs them. These people fill a need with their work. (I'm also sure there are pharmacists that LOVE their jobs but I'm pretty sure the majority feel otherwise.  These people fill a need with their work. ;))  I did find this book very inspirational though.  Did it inspire me to start my own company?  No. (Maybe an Etsy shop. Hmmm.) Did it make me think that I could change the world?  No.  What it did inspire me to do was think beyond my current stage in life.  What goals should I set for myself?  How can I help others? Should I think about switching careers?  Where should I volunteer?  I like books that challenge me in such a personal way.  I also learned a little about business and other interesting organizations (charity: water, FEED, method) in a way that didn't bore me.  That's an impressive feat.  ***I was given this book for free as part of the Books for Bloggers Program.  I was not compensated in any other way and was encouraged to be honest....even if I only used the book as kindling in my fireplace.  My fireplace is electric but this book definitely wouldn't be needed to keep me warm...unless you count warm and fuzzy thoughts.***
0385534639|3.0|I kept seeing this book on all sorts of *best of the year* lists. So I thought I'd give it a try.   My overall impression was \\"meh.\\" I listened to it on audio book, and while the production was good, I found myself just waiting for the book to be over. I was vaguely curious about what was going to happen, but only vaguely. Which is a good thing, as the ending of the book is mostly a non-ending that caps off the mostly non-action that happens through the story.   It wasn't bad. I just don't see the point....

B00062PN6I|1.0|THIS VENDOR IS TERRIBLE, DON'T BUY WITH THEM!  These headphones sound pretty good, except a little distorted on a higher volume (something to expect with cheap headphones).  Also they don't have a volume wheel, again cheap headphones.  The reason for my bad review though, is that, the only reason why I know how they sound is that I purchased three, and one of them was defective (only sound on the right side).  If I had purchased only one, according to what arrived there was a 30% chance that it would be a defective unit.  Also, there is no direct option to make inquiries to them from the order sumary, you have to search through their store front to find a contact option. And once I did get a reply they asked for the complete order info, because they told me they have no record of my order.  SO I pasted the complete order sumary from the email I had gotten from Amazon. And I got what now appears to be a generic reply to give me the run-around, again asking for the complete order info and that they have no records of my order.  So again, thankfully I have the other two units, because it seems I'm not going to get a replacement!!!!!
B000002JEV|5.0|I stole this CD from my dad when I was about sixteen and he's been hounding me ever since. I finally just decided to buy him a new copy because I had no intention of giving him the original. Like the title said, it's easily one of my favorite CD's of all time!

0062119044|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have read in a long while. I persisted with it as I was told it improved around the 100 page mark, however that did not happen. There is not 1 character in the book that is likable or seems like an actual person. I have no idea how this book won awards, avoid it at all cost.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been looking at the Splashtop app since Monday. I read several reviews and decided to sit back and see if it would become a FAOTD. Imagine my delight when it was offered today! I set it up in minutes (very easy!) and tried it out. It is, in a word, AWESOME! It works great with the Kindle Fire. I highly recommend getting this app while it's free. I would have paid the $4.99 price. My only tiny complaint is that it changes the resolution on my laptop when I have the Streamer on.
B004RQVVGU|3.0|This should have been a 5-star review. I've been waiting for this remaster of this classic for years. However, the new 2011 remastering is really disappointing, just like on Blizzard.  At least the bonus disc is a pleasant surprise for Randy Rhoads fans.<br /><br />The Diary disc too compressed and that, unfortunately, kills the dynamics of the music.  The soft parts are louder and the louder parts are softer.  Just listen to the drum hits during the \\"Over the Mountain\\" solo at 2:51 or one of the dramatic parts of \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" at 4:15 and you'll hear there is no impact of the instruments.  The choir and huge churning guitar riff at 5:24 on the title track don't make the big entrance they once did.  The peaks are gone and crushed down in volume.  The drums, crashes, choir and guitars all blend together at the same volume as the previous passage.  Things don't jump out in parts that used to.  When the levels on a CD are pushed too loud as they are here, it makes the CD sound harsh and ruins the dynamics of the music.  My playback system is average, so you don't need expensive equipment to notice this.<br /><br />What happened to the bonus tracks that they dropped?  The leaked artwork of the original disc and track listing included the long versions of \\"Tonight\\" and \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\".  Likely it's because there is still bad blood between the Osbournes and Bob Daisley/Lee Kerslake that these tracks were left off.  They even left Bob and Lee off the performance credits, once again.<br /><br />This is an essential album, but stick to the 1995 remaster for the album tracks (the one with the green border around it and \\"OZZY\\" in big letters on the front and catalog # EK 67236 - make sure to verify the catalog # before buying it used as some sellers use stock photos and mix up versions).  While the 1995 remaster wasn't that great, at least it has more dynamics.  Some people still prefer the old original Jet label CD (although the dropout in \\"Flying High Again\\" at 1:41 is annoying on that one).<br /><br />Get this edition, however, if you are a Randy fan for the bonus live disc.  The version of \\"Flying High Again\\" is from the King Biscuit broadcast (along with some of Ozzy's pre-song banter), but the rest of the disc is unheard and features some great guitar fills not on King Biscuit or Tribute.  The set is from 1981 (probably Aug '81), except the guitar solo is spliced in from the cancelled live 1980 disc, likely because the '81 solo would have been too similar to what's already on Tribute.  I don't like splicing, but the '80 solo is great.  The mix is much better than Tribute, although ProTools and Sound Replacer were obviously used on the drums for a more modern sound.  Still, I think it's a great disc.<br /><br />3 Stars (5 huge stars for the music and the live disc, even though this live disc replaced the cancelled 1980 Southampton live disc that was originally to be an extra disc on Blizzard instead, but minus 2 stars for the terribly compressed remastering and dropping the bonus tracks last minute).<br /><br />By the way, some of the lyrics are still wrong in the CD booklet (it's \\"Legends and curses\\" not \\"Demons and curses\\" in \\"Little Dolls\\").  Bob Daisley wrote most of the lyrics, so check out his website for the proper lyrics to Ozzy songs, including B-sides.<br /><br />If you want to check out more about how loud mastering adversely affects the sound on CD's (Metallica's Death Magnetic anyone?), or you think this Diary '11 remaster didn't lose its dynamics, just type Loudness War into YouTube or Google and you'll see how loud CD's ruin the sonics and dynamics of the music on it.<br /><br />Note to record companies like Sony: if you want to sell more CD's (or the emerging Blu-ray audio), more people will buy them if you just make them sound better, which you can do since the mastering is completely in your control. Poor sound = less sales.that one).  Get this edition, however, if you are a Randy fan for the bonus live disc.

B001JNNDEW|5.0|I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've seen the movie before. It's one of the best movies ever, and I won't even say what I paid for it on here because I don't know what they're asking for it now. I just know that I got an exceptional deal, I think it was a gold box or something. I'm looking forward to watching this version to see what the special flair is all about, but I did get a great price on this, shipping was fast through prime and I'm happy with my purchase.
1592401791|5.0|I could not put it down.  Of course it's written from Geoff Emerick's perspective and his memory of things, and as such is probably not the absolute truth.  But Emerick was there and he's as qualified as anyone to describe what it was like working with the band and EMI \\"all those years ago\\".
0439023513|5.0|I have been an Amazon user for years, and this is my first review. Reason being? I feel that of all books that have received negative reviews in the past, this one has done so for the wrong reasons. I want to address why I felt this was the perfect ending to a brilliant trilogy. But warning: I can't do so without spoiler alerts. So if you're prepared to have key plot points revealed, read on.  First, what I love the most about this book is that, instead  of other YA series popular today (e.g. Twilight), this book doesn't shy away from fully developing its plot and characters into whole, realistic, beautiful completions. What most of the negative reviews complain about is that it didn't live up to the 'love triangle' or prior themes. I strongly beg to disagree.  Instead of rehashing a formula to tie a complete end to her series (think Twilight), Collins reinvents it. She naturally evolves the plot line and all characters with the realistic transformations that war would have on a person. Reviewers complaints that Collins turned Gale into a \\"jerk\\" to solve her triangle are simply naive.  The travesties of this war only served to further permeate each character and scar each of them in the ways that a real war of this degree would. Gale, always aware of the Capitol's manipulation and always dissonant towards it, only comes to fully embody this persona and seek blood for blood out of his rage. We shouldn't be surprised by this; after all, he was never a Hunger Games participant. He never faced those scars, saw that tragedy, experienced it firsthand. We shouldn't be surprised, then, at the naivete of the 'weapons' he introduces to Beetee and his 'heartless' (I'd argue naive) traps and visions of the war.  I think Collin's choice with Peeta in this book was both beautiful and tragic. His loss of idolation toward Katniss made him real, made him tragic, and finally caused Katniss to really, for the first time selflessly, examine her feelings toward him. Thus the natural progression to her choosing Peeta is justified and beautiful.  As for Gale... people deduce that he is a \\"jerk\\" because his bomb design is essentially what kills Prim. But I think, instead, that this was a genius move both in the character development of Gale and in the plot development of the series. After all, the whole trilogy is a metaphor and examination of the current global society in which we live. This final move with Gale shows how those, ignorant of the realities of war but with the power to influence it, can carelessly design weapons and motives with tragic consequences. And, more importantly, that even though an inidividual may seek such destruction out of hatred for an enemy, in the realities of war, it often backfires and effects the ones they were first trying to protect. Has this not been the state of our society for over a decade?  All in all, I think this book stayed truer to the characters and plot than any series finale I can think of. The characters didn't come to a miraculous, happy ending, as often happens. No. They ended up scarred, wounded, changed. Because that is what really happens in war. We don't come to some miraculous solution where we end up on the other side the same perfect people we entered into it. Instead, war takes the worst of us, twists it against us, scars us to the world and leaves us wounded. Bravo to Collins for seeing that through.  Summed up? Gale doesn't end up a \\"jerk.\\" He ends up losing, forever, the one he loves, due to his naivete to the horrors of the situation and subsequent naive and impatient revenge seeking, and ends up a victim of the weapon he so rashly produced, without ever first contemplating the consequences. That is real. This was a brilliant conclusion to a brilliant series.

It has catchy wording and interesting pictures.  I don't mind reading this book 10 times in a row.  This fact is awesome for me and even awesome-er for my daughter who demands the same book be read over and over and over. Great for learning as I ask her to point out both story and non-story related illustrations in the book.  I encourage her to finish lines from the book and she enthusiastically obliges.  Love it!

B005HPY8LU|5.0|Stronger...what a perfect title! It had to take guts and strength to come out and voice her support for Ron Paul. That support drove me to revisit her music. I was a huge fan at the start of American Idol and just the pressures of middle age life, work, 4 kids, etc have pulled me away from the carefree days of listening to music...exploring new artists and utilizing iTunes. I attribute my purchase of this CD entirely to her brave endorsement of Ron Paul but that doesn't take away one bit from the fact that she has one of the best voices in the industry today and her music is inspiring. I love Ron Paul...and now I love Kelly Clarkson!

B0068TJLSY|2.0|Often, a movie requires the audience to exercise a degree of willing suspension of disbelief. \\"Independence Day\\" had some examples, but they were overcome by the sheer fun of the story and the fact that they weren't totally in your face about it.  But this . . .<br /><br />First of all, the movie was shot so dark that there are multiple times that it's impossible to know what's going on.  Perhaps J.J. thinks it's cool to leave almost entire scenes to the imagination, but there is nothing new about telling a story with audio only. Just ask your grandparents about radio shows.<br /><br />The acting is mostly believable, but the actions of the characters are not. When the acting becomes lost in unlikely actions, I cease to care.  For example:<br /><br />The train has wrecked. Military personnel are almost immediately on the scene.  Obviously this train is very important to the government. The kids are warned by the doctor that they and their families will be killed by the government if they are discovered to know anything about what has happened.  The kids, terrified, flee the scene and all agree to never speak of it again.<br /><br />So what do they do shortly afterward? They return to the train wreck to film it. From an open area on a nearby hill. In full sight.  The area is swarming with soldiers, vehicles, and helicopters, searching everything in the area. Except, of course, the group of young people on the hill right in front of them who are filming everything.  Somehow, this doesn't seem to interest anyone, nor are the kids seemingly worried at all anymore about their lives or the lives of their families.<br /><br />Not much later, they film the soldiers emptying a house of it's contents. This time they are doing the filming within a few feet of where the soldiers are working.  And nobody says anything.  Eventually the C.O. asks an aide what they kids are doing, only to have the matter forgotten when the Sheriff takes one of the kids - and the camera - with him.<br /><br />I am amazed that so many people could like this movie after such an insult to their intelligence.  Overlooking plot holes is sometimes needed, I understand that.  But this was so monumentally stupid, so glaringly obvious, that it ruined the movie. Nor was that the end of it.  This was just the first in a series of grinding, merciless non sequiturs that soon leave the mind numbed in detached boredom, waiting for the insult to end.  I give it two stars only for the fun 1970's references and the lack, for once, of endless CGI action scenes.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how each chapter is linked to audio. Access to footnotes as well as the ability to create our own is a blessing. Thank you for providing this free!
0553801473|5.0|I have read all of the books of the series over the past 7 months. A Dance With Dragons picked up some great arcs and it introduced some new ones too. I really ejoyed the book. The only problem is now, I really want to know what happens next with all of my favorite characters. I just hope book 6 dosn't take too long to come out.
1451648537|4.0|This is a fine book that admirably captures Jobs' life and legacy. It shows the good and bad. It does not hesitate to talk about Jobs' cruelty and harshness, but often places that in the context of his drive and determination for great products. It shows that he may have been a jerk, but he was a jerk who deeply valued his work and the products he presented to the world. The book goes over his early failings, including his removal from Apple and the failed NeXT business, but uses that to point out that he ably learned from those failures with Pixar and Apple. Jobs, in his relatively short life, accomplished so many things, and fearlessly forged ahead at all times. This is captured well in the book. As such, it's clearly a success.   It's structured a bit oddly. The first half is more or less a linear telling of Jobs' life. But once it hits his return to Apple. Here, it hops around based on the products Apple developed, occasionally with interludes about his family. Maybe this is a reflection of Jobs - as it is made clear in the book, he was focused on his work until his last days. But still it feels a bit odd, and dare I say it - like Isaacson was pushing a bit to get this book done now. Still, the stories it tells are good.   If I had any complaint, it would be that I wish the book was more technical. Isaacson was clearly writing for an audience that loves Apple products, but is not well-versed in the nuts and bolts of it all. I can understand that, and I can even understand that this may even be a reflection of Jobs himself (who was not an engineer). Still, Apple's products are a combination of both great engineering and great design, and the book seems to focus a bit too much on the second.    I really, really enjoyed this book. It's a great read, and despite its size, it's quick. In the end, though, all I can think is that we lost a great visionary much too soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is a really fun and awesome game love to play it all the time. I can play it all day long.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this app almost daily. have it on my phone &amp; kindle fire..<br />only wish I didn't need a signal or wifi to use NLT.
B001AFF25W|3.0|There's nothing new  or noteworthy in this book, if you've read any self help or time emangement books at all, you've seen all this before.  The style is breezy so it's an easy read without a lot of psycho-babble.  My beef, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, is that it is focused almost entirely on work-how to impress your boss, take more courses to improve you job performance etc.  The first suggestion in the book is to \\"sit down with your boss\\" to set goals.  The author assumes that most people work, and they work in traditional offices.  I'm really tired of books that give advice like \\"listen to audiobooks on your drive to work.\\". The title of the book should include the words \\" at Work.\\"  it doesn't relate for people who don't work outside the home, or have non traditional jobs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is awesome. the graphics are amazing.  I would recommend this for everyone with a kindle fire. I will tell all my friends.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Get it.  It is the best predictor.  A must have.  Stupid word minimum. Gotta pad more. Yes,  pad even more.
B002OHK7CS|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv, always something going on, you just can't wait till the next episode airs. It has charaters you love, and then there are the one's you just love to hate, great entertainment. Violence yeah, but come on it's a biker show, and a great one.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|Good
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its ok app.  I haven't played it too much yet.  But it could take up time.  Now I just have to fill up space.
0307595579|5.0|Worth the read... Great story. I wanted to get back into reading and I am vey happy with this choice. The books are about 500 pages each but well worth the read! Highly recommend
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been playing around with this app for a few hours and its awesome. I'm really looking forward to using this for school.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Have tried others, this predicts the best! Faster Texting for me. 62 years young and easily keeping up with granddaughter. Thanks SwiftKey.
034552554X|2.0|I read all the positive reviews on Amazon for The Language Of Flowers and was so excited to read it ... and bring it on my holiday beach vacation.  I was looking for a good beach read... plus i adore flowers.  Well, i just finished reading it... what a disappointment!  First off, the main character Victoria Jones isn't even likable, so when goodness comes her way and she turns from it... (over and over again) it's hard to have any appreciation or emotion for Victoria.  The other female characters were basically simple and silly.  The story is very predictable and... unfortunately, the ending doesn't fit the character (Victoria Jones) at all... it was a sell out ending... not fitting with the storyline or character.  I would have given this book one star, but did appreciate the refreshing use of the language of flowers and their meaning.  That is clearly all you'll gain from this read.  Unfortunately, it's not a story that will cling to your heart.  I would not recommend reading this very disappointing book... as much as you might like the title or cove
B005974CNA|5.0|With or without Mike Portnoy, DT is as strong as ever. My only problem with this album is the production value..especially in the drum section. I felt that the mix was some what muffled compared to previous records. Having said that, it's epic from start to the emotionally driven climax.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app out there.... Almost every version is available in it and some are available for offline use! Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this App there are a lot of different games to play. so far it hasn't forced closed like many other free apps.
B0063IH60K|5.0|For a free app this is great. I enjoy playing it on my kindle fire. Definitely recommend this awesome app!!
B000I9WWHW|2.0|I don't know what else I should have expected ... I mean, as if Hollywood is the expert on the metaphysical .. ha!  In fact before you watch it ask yourself if you got all the actors in Hollywood together with their feel-good reality-is-what-you-make-of-it mumbo jumbo to decide what the afterlife would be like what you'll come up with is probably this movie.  The ending has a twist in the last couple minutes that is just so typical of the kind of people who think that falling in love is better than being in love (ie - shallow people who aren't very good at maintaining relationships).  To someone like me who prizes wisdom above the torturous path to get wisdom, well ... let's just say that it seems those who don't probably have never gained wisdom in the first place and spend to much time romanticizing the way things were than appreciating what really happened and getting on with eternity.  In short, if that's what heaven is like (and I'm confident it isn't) then no wonder why so few people are interested in getting there.  Sad thing is ... I think most people think that's what it is and don't yet realize what a drag that kind of eternity would be.  IMO there is so much more to the universe and the rest of eternity than what's on this amazing little planet ... this life is just a stepping stone to get there, and well if I were to do a movie about what I think the afterlife is like ... it would blow your mind if you thought this movie came even moderately close.  It is said that when Steve Jobs died his last 3 words were \\"Oh Wow ... oh wow ... oh wow\\".  I don't know if that was due to what he was witnessing or a realization ... but regardless I think film could not come close to do justice to what the world beyond this one is really like, let alone the reality of what the purpose of our existence here really is about.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice animation, well-designed for easy, intuitive playing. Has plenty of options to change card style and background color,  and lots of different options for playing style and scoring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the the way you have to earn points to get new new stuff. it gives the game purpose. I'm not very far yet but the games are sort of challenging. idk maybe its just me. the instructions aren't very clear and you mostly have to figure things out yourself but its a good time-waster.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Got this in just a few days with no issues whatsoever.  I purchased it as a gift for my nephew and he was just thrilled.  It was nice not to have to go Christmas shopping at the mall!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app.  Easy to use and very intuitive.  Even good when using from my phone.  A must have for any tablet.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Got this in just a few days with no issues whatsoever.  I purchased it as a gift for my nephew and he was just thrilled.  It was nice not to have to go Christmas shopping at the mall!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|had it for my ipad first and loved it, now I use it all the time on my Android EVO! Get. this. app.
B0001XPZGA|3.0|This is a great album.  I have the CD and SACD versions of it and decided to buy the vinyl.  I noticed that although the sound is close to the SACD version, there are some noticeable flaws on the sound on the vinyl.  It seems like there are vinly pressing issues.  I hope they will fix this issue.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I fail to understand why someone would choose to use this over an Android Remote Desktop client for Windows machines, or VNC for Windows without RDP/other OS machines.<br /><br />(1) You have to install a proprietary chunk of software on the host machine (which I strongly suspect is a modified VNC server, and is a prime candidate for spyware as it by definition has to log every key you press)<br /><br />(2) You have to pay for it, whereas Teamview, 2xClient+Micorosfot Windows Remote Desktop (RDP) and androidVNC+TightVNC are all free.<br /><br />(3) If you want to stream media, there are MUCH better solutions than a remote desktop, like Subsonic (where it's a snap to install your own media server on your own home computer) or Google Music (hosted in the cloud, but unfortunately only available in the USA)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is the best RDC replacement out there. Easy to use. Mouse and keyboard are easy for me and I love that it supports dual monitors!
B005KELQEU|3.0|I was disappointed on how the sleeve opened.  It does not allow you to read the kindle while in the sleeve.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great game to play when bord or when you tiered of doing anythinh with a time restraint. on it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Good app that works with my tablet. It show a nice quality desktop displayed on my gtab. I would definitely recommend those app
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a lot fun! It seems so easy but it is challenging. It gives great hints if you are stuck.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|abstract. good. bad.  even as it was watching earth form (and destroying it but that wasn't shown) it could hear her whining about the man embryo that \\"her\\" body made -- while pumping her heart -- with the help of his seed. that's alot of work and quite a price to pay for such intense elation...the great sorrow that is. i mean her whining was so awesome that it even interrupted the tranquil forming of earth including the celestial orchestra which coincidently happens to sound like 20th century sentimental stuff. how did her brief moment of eternal pain echoe across time like that? man that's trippy \\"yo'\\"  bbc dino's instead of j.park dino's: no.  orphan dino not courageous. accepting. sentiments were around way before sapians sapians  a chair moves by itself  dang those bad neighborhoods looked good back then. what's a few slaps to prevent one from being a happy/sad middle aged burger flipper. whoops. he was less testosterone-based but architect aint bad for a musician who wasn't supposed to be too good  shouldn't have slept with white lights on  girlz  dad no longer super. now (projected)hypocrite  be quiet! no spanky? not bad for a non-war zone. drip. drip  yes. dad's gone. no need to explain. scare mom our way not his. his way not ours  more wind. and. light  creepster  dad's back. at least we knew what was down there  i'm a pretty thang and never camped as a kid plus i hang out at posh ultra lounges. i have long since left...  oh. they did show the earth destroying.  oh. nice. i didn't know it was like this. let me call stanley. see if he can give some pointers  dang. so we can't blame you since you felt it along with us. even more so  uh. what just happened - again  joviality, love, fearless compassion, p'rn?  more dialectics please
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solid game, it plays very well. Functions exactly the way it seems like it should. Wish there were other varieties of solitaire included, like freecell.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|very impressive utility app.  set up was a breeze and picture quality and functionality were near flawless.  using internet explorer I had access to all of my old favorites which I haven't had time to add to my phone.  also, I've basically added 100 gigabyte storage to my phone by using my computers harddrive.<br /><br /> thank you amazon app store for this free app of the day.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|simple games good ol fashioned fun for everyone the table hockey game is my favorite game so far but I haven't unlocked everything yet
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun. you have to keeping playing until you beat each game so you unlock more games.  some of the games are hard to control.
B006QLH7O4|5.0|This movie was pretty cool.  I won't go into any details about the various deaths, storyline or acting; I mostly wanted to comment on the 3D effects since that's why you're buying this version!    I felt like the 3D effects were awesome and effective.  Not only did many of the (gruesome and gory) deaths utilize the 3D effect well, many scenes in the movie - whether it was a transition scene or just a scene with the characters speaking - used the effect too, creating moments of depth with people and objects.  There were also moments in which objects flew or poked out of the screen (for all of you that want that effect).  :D  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend purchasing it, however, not from Amazon.com.  This is currently being sold at Best Buy for around 25 bucks, so I would definitely go there.  Also, I used my VIZIO  passive 3D set with some RealD glasses to watch the movie and the effect was fantastic.  I feel like the effects look crisper and cleaner on a passive 3D screen, though that may not be true for everyone.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Same Black Keys talent, just more refined. I can understand some people not liking the more produced sound, but I think it's still a great album. Dead and Gone is my favorite song, but the whole album you can listen to in one sitting without even realizing it.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I know the description says home desktop but does it work if your home computer is a laptop and not an actual desktop??
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Awesome app. Streams very quickly over 3g and wifi! Love it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun and kills time when you get bored! it runs good ln kindle fire! the ad thing sucks
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Does not work on Razor, just kills mobile data.  Finds computer then fails when it attempts to connect.  At least I got it for free.
