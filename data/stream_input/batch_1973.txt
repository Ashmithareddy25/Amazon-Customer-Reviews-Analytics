B0019MEPI6|5.0|I have been trying to find a reasonably priced copy of Zodiac on Blu-ray to replace my HDDVD copy for a long time. I even ordered twice from sellers on Amazon only to find they were scams. When I saw that Warner Bros. was re-issuing this title, I found it on Amazon and immediately pre-ordered it for dirt cheap. After receiving it this weekend I can tell you that it appears to be identical to the original, same discs, same artwork, right down to the same UPC code. Warner covers the old code with a new UPC sticker on the case. Check it out at the following link. [[ASIN:B00AG472DS Zodiac [Blu-ray]]]

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is an amazing read that you won't be able to put down. Although it's a short book, it is packed with knowledge and insight. Following the journey of Charlie, the main character, and his friends, makes you understand a life that would otherwise be difficult to grasp. While reading this book, you grow along with Charlie. Though some parts of this book are happy, other parts can be depressing, It's like a rollercoaster that you don't want to get off. Read this book and it'll become one of your favorites. I would tell you more, but you should read it and find out for yourself.
1423140591|5.0|I liked this one better than the first book in this series solely because Percy was the main focus. Now, Jason is a great guy but he's just not Percy. I liked how even though he lost his memories of his Camp Half-Blood life, he never forgot Annabeth.<br />I loved Ella. I want a chicken like her.<br />Great continuation of the series, can't wait to read more!

055338466X|2.0|In which we meet yet another first-class scientist who wishes to self-identify as a second-class philosopher and a comedian from the back end of steerage.<br /><br />Since few will buy A Grand Design for its wit we can forgive Stephen Hawking's appalling attempts to be funny, but it's not so easy to forgive his philosophical ignorance. Certain physical scientists might be better off unacquainted with the modern philosophy of science (though those who know it possess a welcome sense of perspective and humility). But not world-renowned cosmologists. Their field continually bumps up against the boundary of what science even is (and it doesn't have a \\"no-boundary condition\\", whatever that might be).<br /><br />So when Stephen Hawking claims that \\"philosophy has not kept up with modern science, especially physics\\" it suggests not only a lack of perspective and humility, but that Hawking has been skipping on some required reading.  Especially since, having written off the discipline, Hawking seems barely acquainted with it. He mentions few philosophers more recent than Rene Descartes (d. 1650). So it is hard to know who he thinks hasn't kept up.<br /><br />Particularly when Hawking's first grand pronouncement is \\"model-dependent reality\\": the idea that there may be alternative ways to model the same physical situation with fundamentally different elements and concepts. \\"If [such different models] accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other.\\" Physics has, apparently, been forced into this gambit following recent failures to get unifying calculations to work themselves out. In any case it isn't quite the neat trick Hawking thinks it is.<br /><br />Firstly, while model-dependent reality might be news to Stephen Hawking (he seems to think it the fruit of modern physics' womb) the philosophers he hasn't been reading have been talking about it for years, if not centuries, to the constant sound of scientists' excoriations. It is even part of Descartes' [[ASIN:1481018779 philosophical fabric]] (and, more tellingly, [[ASIN:1619491303 Darwin]]'s , but picking a fight with [[ASIN:0618918248 modern evolutionists]], while fun, is a story for another day). That is to say, it sounds like it is the physicists who are finally catching up with the philosophers and not the other way around.<br /><br />Secondly, in the grand game of philosophers' football that Cosmology has become, the model-dependent reality play is something of a surrender before kick-off.  For if it is true that the same phenomenon can be plausibly accounted for in multiple, \\"incommensurate\\" (© [[ASIN:0226458083 Thomas Kuhn]]) ways, then the hard question is not about the truth in itself of any model, but the criteria for determining which of the (potentially infinite) models available we should choose in the first place.<br /><br />This question is not one for physics, but metaphysics. It necessarily exists outside any given model (© [[ASIN:1844674428 Paul Feyerabend]]). Here we meet our old friend, Occam's Razor. This isn't a scientific principle at all, but a pragmatic rule of thumb with no intellectual pedigree: all else being equal, take the simplest explanation. Occam's Razor is a favourite instrument for the torture of hapless Christians by grumpy biologists: all your tricksy afterlife wagers and so on fail because evolution is so much less complicated and has so much more explanatory value than the idea that an omniscient, intangible, invisible, omnipotent entity pulling strings we can't see to make the whole thing go.<br /><br />But, alas, in seeking a grand unification of things that really aren't asking to be unified, cosmology reveals some almighty snags. Unification under Hawking's programme, if it is even possible, involves slaughtering some big old sacred cows. To name a few: causality, the conventional conception of space-time; the idea that scientific theories should be based on observable data and their outcomes testable.It bows to some truly heinous false idols too. For example: seven invisible space-time dimensions, a huge mass of invisible dark matter, an arbitrary cosmological constant, a potentially infinite array of unobservable universes which wink in and out of existence courtesy of a mathematically inferred \\"vacuum energy\\"). Hawking doesn't propose solutions to these problems, but seems to think they're a fair price for achieving grand unification.<br /><br />I'm not so sure: other than intellectual bragging rights, the resulting unified theory has no obvious marginal utility. And it has political drawbacks: believing one's model to be the truth carries potentially unpleasant implications for the suppression of those who don't.<br /><br />There are practical drawbacks, too. We are asked to reject existing theories, which still have quite a lot of utility, in favour of something that it infinitely harder to understand and work with. The accelerating expansion of the universe without any apparent acting force seems to violate Newton's second law of motion. Without an outrageous end-run, the first nanosecond of the Big Bang (wherein the universe is obliged to expand in size by ten squillion kilometres - i.e. far faster than the speed of light) seems to violate the fundamentals of general relativity. String theory requires seven necessarily unobservable space-time dimensions and/or entirely different universes, and even then doesn't yield a single theory but millions of the blighters, all slightly inconsistent with each other (hence the appeal to \\"model dependent reality).<br /><br />From the camp which wielded Occam's Razor so heartily against the Christians, this seems a bit rich. If these are the options, then the razor might slice in favour of the big guy with the beard.<br /><br />But these aren't the options. We could save a lot of angst, and perhaps could have avoided digging trillion dollar circular tunnel under Geneva, had we employed model dependent reality the way the philosophers saw it and not the scientists (and shouldn't we call a spade a spade and label it cognitive relativism, by the way?). Since it crossed the event horizon of observability modern cosmology has become arcane, stunt-mathematics. If there were a chance that it might deliver time-travel, hyperspace or a tool for locating wormholes to other galaxies or universes then one could see the point in this intellectual onanism. But none of that seems to be allowed. So we should therefore ask the question \\"but why? What's the point? What progress do you promise that we can't achieve some other way?\\" No one seems to be able to answer that question.<br /><br />But if we park it, what's left of Stephen Hawking's latest book is some pretty ropey jokes.<br /><br />Olly BuxtonIt bows to some truly heinous false idols too.

B00APJLEGA|5.0|My 6 year old loves this movie. We've watched it over and over since Thursday when we bought it. :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I feel this book had a very powerful ending. The last two books were not as emotional with the exception of Rue and people like Mags. This book makes you want to cry sometimes. Overall this book with rock your mind and your conscientious.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! I couldn't put it down once I started. There is so much detail in every chapter that it made it easy to keep up with the story.
B006IYG5HE|2.0|The Redbreast (Harry Hole).<br />Rambling.The different aspects of the plot do do come together in a timely fashion. Would hesitate to recommend this book.
0765325950|2.0|I was prepared for the worst with the teasers.  I was not overcome by what were only a few saving scenes (some Olver moments were well done, Talmanes came into his own)  But... Sea Folk no... resolution, Seanchan most characters were under utilized, Sharans perhaps the most disappointing (Worst kept secret that it was the stronghold of ....), Important Egwene scene should have evoked more... didn't(Came away with the feeling that the person she was based on pissed off or disappointed the powers that be for the book)... Moraine could have just stayed where she was for all the import she brought... a few well placed  words at her return was kind of expected not really artfully crafted as much as perfunctory.  You come away with the feeling that new characters like Androl and his Aes Sedai were fun to write for the author and the old ones were sort of glued together. The failure in this book is mostly the villains... When they have practically all met with defeat before they had to really go hard or go home... they went home.  So the triumph of the Heroes feels not so Heroic... except for Olver...  In fact you had to sully some really good heroes to make this last battle a challenge for the Heroes. (Where the hell did all these damn Trollocs come from... if you had this many why did you suck for a THOUSAND YEARS!!!) You find yourself saying Why isn't Siuan's bond working???  Why isn't the Lady Bashere not slashing throats and taking charge if she is same that we came to know...Instead she's a Tammy Wynet type... I don't buy it. And.... Elayne provided her people with tools... why not provide them to her newest and most valuable recruits??? Why didn't Egwene equip her troops with cuendear sheild???  Androl could have dropped every Trolloc from a thousand feet up, beheaded mr. balefire and been home for lunch. Every hero mysteriously lost a good 50 IQ points coming into this battle... Which makes me feel like I lost the same buying and reading it... but it's over now...May I never get sucked in to a living Authors \\"epic\\" tale agian!!!  except maybe JK Rowling...  or Stephenie Meyer... they knew when to call it quits and how to really sell a Hero...  JK... adults fighting kids so pretty easy but still very well done.  Stephanie Meyer.... \\"They came with  pageantry\\"... come on  Any one of her villains would have wiped the floor with the lot of these guys..

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The three books are definitely easy to read one straight after the other keeping the story line flowing and the guts of the story alive, unlike the stop after the one movie which actually goes nowhere.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|In the same vein as \\"Tuesdays\\" & \\"The Five People,\\" this book makes you think about your priorities and actions but leaves you hopeful and encouraged.  It was a good read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this trilogy from the beginning to end. I know Ana never in her wildest dreams never thought she would be falling for Mr. Christian.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is my favorite move.  It's just beautiful shot, has an excellent script, and is made all the more amazing by the wonderful mostly unknown actors.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|While not up to the author's later novel, &#34;Dark Places&#34;, she draws some interesting, disturbed characters whose interactions are often hard to believe.

B006O3MU96|1.0|I couldn't move doodle at all. It was just moving around on it's own.  Do NOT BUY THIS APP EVER. I was scammed.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a basic hidden object game. It keeps you going but there is not a story line. It is ok.
B005LAII80|5.0|This was an amazing adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics that have been running for decades. It painted an incredibly dark and bleak future where Judges serve as the law, which is exactly what the movie needed to be. It was fun, violent, and packed with action. Even if you are not a fan of the comics you should definitely check out this movie because it harkens back to a more classic style of action movie, where no love story or extraneous plot is needed, just good guys fighting bad guys.<br /><br />Now for the bad part though, I was incredibly excited about the release of the blu ray but had extensive issues when it came to playability. I own two different blu ray players and the film would not work on either player, it would not even be recognized. This was the case with a total of four copies of the movie and it wasn't just my players, the store that I purchased it from checked all of the copies on almost every blu ray player in the store and could only get it to work on one. I hope they fix the issue because I would love to own this movie on blu ray but for now I am having to hold off.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I got this for Christmas and built it during the Christmas break. It was enjoyable to build and is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Rather than putting it on the shelf, I plan to hang it from my ceiling so that the shuttle can be flying like it is meant to.

B007FH9GA6|5.0|just saw this movie for the first time. watched it again a<br />few days later. absolutely incredible....the swedish version<br />is rumored to be even better. it takes a few viewings<br />to get the players and plot together. now, i will watch the<br />swedish version.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Was surprised when I had to purchase more bubbles!  It was a fun game, but my kids enjoyed it more than I did.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|its a fun simple game about matching blocks I just wish will stories in between removed along with the little follow line<br />game thing they got
B008N1V11U|1.0|The biggest problem are the controls. Hard to manage the camera. It's trying to be like the console games, but you just can't fake the experience on a tablet.<br />It's cheesy and bland. The story is about as good as the movie's story, which isn't a good thing.<br />I imagine people that people giving this garbage high reviews are just desperate for a good game in their mobile device. Don't waste your money.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|love these games!! I like the dominoes option instead of hidden object mini games. nice touch. can't wait for the next g5 game.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I have this game on my smart phone also.  I enjoy playing it and find it relaxing and time filling.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham continues to be one of my favorite authors with this book.  It is difficult to put it down once you start because something new unfolds with each page.  I never expected the twist at the end as John always does with his stories.  This was a great first book for my new Kindle.
0307346617|2.0|I guess it's a cool idea to structure it like real documents, but I want to read a story when I choose a novel, not bits and pieces of things with footnotes. I head this was good, but I only read about 15 pages and lost interest.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|So sexy and funny without being X-rated. I think I'll really enjoy this new \\"type\\" of Harlequin. I want my own Connor Reed!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Is really liked the way the plot had such an unexpected twist...wasn't expecting it turn out the way it did.  Was a much better read than I was anticipating....Holder turned out to be a real knight in shining armor for Sky...definitely recommend to anyone who likes a happy, yet complicated ending.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|If you enjoy violence with a touch of erotic display this is the perfect season for you. Each episode keeps you wanting more and more. I can't wait to watch season two.
B00A2FSTC4|5.0|Very innovative; another good performance from Cruise. This is one of those movies to which you can find yourself going back to once in a while.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|One, it's pink!!  Two, it works fabulously.  I love that I can now prop up my kindle in order to watch videos and read so I'm not looking at it flat or having to hold it.  It makes life so much easier.  My kindle feels very secure in it's case, and I think if I were to drop it, it would survive.  The only thing I don't like, is that it only stays propped up in the landscape mode.  I wish it would prop up in portrait as well to make reading a little easier.  But all in all, the case is super awesome!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|The ability of Taleb to articulate the paradigm shift called for is unprecedented. We have become so enamored of stability that we go to extreme to avoid any destabilization. We cover our eyes and hide when it is happening. Taleb not only shows the importance of embracing volatility but some core principles in how to do so personally, particularly<br /><br />I already have much of this way of thinking in my work and therefore I am very contrarian to most of my field and business thinking.The only flaw I see in the book is it seems his understanding of living systems is new, although very useful in the book. I look forward to the next iteration knowing a deeper understanding will add to his thinking. Resilience by  Andrew Zolli and Ann Marie Healy and my own book, The Responsible Business, (Carol Sanford) will fill in this small limit and enable personal application of Taleb's brilliant articulation of a very complex change of mind we need. Also how to have organizations structure cultures to operation this way and design work systems that build this capability is not yet offered by Taleb. But since I have been building such work systems for almost 4 decades, I am thrilled to have the case built for doing so.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|Loved this book. Gripping and inspirational highly recommended, couldn't put it down, one that I will keep and talk about, incredible, just incredibly inspiring. It goes to show that anything is possible. Fantastic!

0553801473|3.0|I have long been a fan of the series, and Martin is a tremendous writer.  But MAN why does he inflict this dizzying cast of characters on us and himself.  By having so many characters you can only move each one forward a tiny bit per chapter, and the net result is a novel of parts too small that move too slow.  I would have much rather seen fewer characters achieve more.<br /><br />It seems like this series is stuck.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|the ending makes you feel good. However by the end I kind of skipped the sex scenes just wanted to know where the two of them end up. Maybe there will be a fourth book when they both are old and wrinkled, but I guess there will be plastic surgeons that keep the couple young and perfect in body for the rest of their life.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The characters are consistent, the story unlikely. The book is easy to read, except for the sex scenes at time, I didn't know if I'd want to have the two together or not, because I saw fifty warning signs of danger.
0765325950|2.0|Overall: This final volume is basically a reassertion of all of the things Jordan has reasserted time and again throughout the series. Little new thematically, and what there is, at the very end, clashes mightily with almost the entirety of the previous 13 volumes. This is a book that tries to have it both ways and left me rolling my eyes. It is paced as well as it can be for its immense size, but it could have easily been 400 pages shorter without a loss of story integrity.<br /><br />Character Development: Characters finally make some tough decisions. Characters (a vast majority of them only minor) finally die. But, as in most of this series, there is very little development. The focus seems more so on reinforcing the initial themes of the characters, dismissing much of the development that has gone before, and therefore they remain mere archetypes.<br /><br />Writing Structure: 909 pages, 800 of which are essentially descriptions of channelers blowing things up with the One Power, and regular folks running things over with horses or impaling stuff on pikes. Reprises of tangential characters now fighting in the The Last Battle, fill interstices between the main characters, and the chapters, rather than focusing on only one character, of necessity jump from place to place.<br /><br />Denouement: After a fairly lame climax (peppered with plenty of subplot anticlimaxes), the rest of the tale is not quite as lame as the the end of Stephen King's Dark Tower series (the part after his disclaimer/warning), but pretty dreadful just the same. It felt tacked on, or perhaps more accurately, it felt like a screenplay description of how the movie would end.<br /><br />Theme: This remains, despite the fact that it took 23 years to finish, a work for teens. The dichotomy between Good(tm) versus Evil(tm) is such a tired trope. There are glimmers in the work of the more realistic struggle: Ingtar's despair in The Great Hunt, Lanfear's cunning, Perrin wrestling with the strength of his desire, but It's basically flotsam amidst the constant refrain of Light versus Dark. Those glimmers are a bit forced in this final volume, and I'm left with the feeling that you get after forcing yourself to eat a last few bites of a meal so you'll get a clean plate.his desire, but It's basically flotsam amidst the constant refrain of Light versus Dark.

I had never seen the show.  i don't watch much tv.  anyway, she made me go to amazon and gave me $10 and we started playing season 1 of walking dead.  she knew by the time her $10 was done i would be paying for the rest my self.  we stayed up late, two nights in a row and went through 2 seasons in 3 days.  thanks to her i had an action plan on december 21, 2012.  my plan--if the zombies came, i would run along side my friend and somehow accidentally trip her.  it's a zombie eat girl world out there.
B004UID2LC|1.0|The app was great but now I can't watch a single vid I uninstalled and reinstalled it 5 times and it still won't work
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a great story that kept me captivated throughout the book.<br />At first there are  lot of misconceptions and rumours between Holder and Sky, but the truth was a fantastic story with a lot of twist, turns, heartbreak, and love. I highly recommend this book.

1451620829|5.0|I did not expect very much out of the autobiography of - let's be honest - the least talented member of the KISS family, the first fired from the group, and the least accomplished outside of the group.  Well, shock me - this is the best autobiography written \\"by\\" a KISS member to date.<br /><br />Gene's autobio is so completely self-serving as to be almost useless as real history, Ace can't remember much of his own life - but Peter, for all his problems, is not only remembering some excellent and often very funny stories from the road, he's in the mood to pay back everyone on his 'naughty' list in this book.  Nobody, including himself - he is remarkably honest about his own failures and mistakes - emerges unscathed.<br /><br />You will learn plenty about Peter's proto-gang youth, his misfires in meaningless bands before his big break in KISS.  Once the band does kick off, it's tour-tour-tour, and the many, many stories are great, and just what you'd hope to read.  The personal dynamics in the band are handled well, relatively nuanced let's say - it wasn't Gene/Paul vs Peter/Ace from day one, but this dynamic emerges over the years.  The albums, the tracks played on, how Peter was sidelined in the late 70s and basically fired, is all there.  The drugs, women, and personal dysfunction of pretty much everyone in the group and associated with it comes out really well.<br /><br />After Peter's out, he's addicted, stuck with a parasitic wife, and is unable to get a real solo career going in any shape or form.  He's off to rehab, moves to California, and is finally ready to blow his brains out.  Then come the reunion tours, and while the bank account is refilled nicely, the personality conflicts come right back.<br /><br />Peter touches on issues only hinted at in the other books.  He's specific on the dollars, how and where he felt cheated financially, who lied to him about what, right down the line.  He's breathtakingly honest.<br /><br />Finally, it should be mentionedhe had once before attempted an autobiography, which was shelved due to his dissatisfaction with the ghost writer.  In this case, Larry Sloman seems to capture Peter's voice exceptionally well; the story hangs together fluidly, the book reads as though it were being read to you by Peter, and the language is, well, about what you'd expect.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this book, and I think each and every KISS fan, including those not especially interested in specifically Peter Criss's story, would love this book.
0451232852|5.0|Since I had loved the book, I was excited to use it as a stocking stuffer for both my sons this Christmas.
B005LAII08|5.0|This is a great movie.  Both the kids and the adults in the house enjoy watching it.  We are all Disney fans and were pleased with this purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|fantastic! couldn't put it down i highly recommend this book. its almost scary to think about how are government will be like in the future
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I chose a five star rating as this case is made very well. All leather outside. Inside has strap to put hand through, part that holds tablet swivels. Can also use hands free. Would highly recomend it!
0385535147|5.0|My son was thrilled to get both of the Grisham books on his wish list for Christmas. He's a happy reader!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We watched this on our Christmas Eve.  A great family film, even our 2 year old enjoyed it.  I nice story about joy of christmas and the importance of family....and funny too!
B00447L4KA|5.0|Okay, maybe not EVER, but it's definitely one of my favorite movies :-)  It's a very modern version of &#34;The Taming of the Shrew&#34; by William Shakespeare.  Heath and Julia are extremely sweet together.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I love the game you should more gems for the fee you charge<br />Not happy w/spending extra money.<br />Happy new year
0345536886|5.0|How can you go wrong with a Grisham novel, that was on a wish list? Son was delighted and is already reading it.
1426209584|5.0|An amazing and beautifull book. A must have for all bird (of paradise) lovers! Great pictures and good text. An unbelievable achievement of the auteurs.
0062515675|5.0|This fictional account is very interesting and insightful.  I really enjoyed it and I would highly recommend it if you like philosophy and self-help books.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Wish it provided more &#34;hints&#34; for free instead of having to purchase them! Other than that great mind exercise while stuck in traffic
B001GQ3DXS|4.0|I enjoy reading Jane Austen Inspired novels. Amanda Grange has created a satisfactory novel involving Persuasion. Her characters and language fit the times.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very pleased with this app. I just recently bought a Kindle Fire and downloaded this app. I was surprised that it was free. I really like it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|If you're a Dylan fan you'll love the good old Dylan. Reminds me of days gone by with the gravelly voice of Mr. Dylan
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Eh it's ok. Nothing to make me replace the actual board game or skip the bingo gatherings!!!!! Thank you all
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is a great motherboard for someone that's looking for a board capable of handling 2 nvidia OR amd graphics cards (at full x16 speed no less) while sticking within a budget. The bigger brothers of this board, the ud5 and the ud7, are capable of 3 way and 4 way graphics cards but most people only use 2 maximum due to CPU bottlenecks beyond 2 GPUs. This board looks slick, works fine, and comes shipped with the am3+ bios pre-installed (err, well it SHOULD at least - it will tell you on the box) so you can pop an amd fx processor that's for am3+ socket in and it will recognize it right away. I personally still have an am3 amd 1055t processor and I have it clocked to 3.6GHz with this board and it's running at stock voltages with a basic closed loop water system (asetek - OEM version of the corsair H50 essentially). So, I'm up from 2.8GHz to 3.6GHz with this board - that's about a 20% overclock yet I'm running stock voltage too so no wear on the CPU even. Great motherboard gigabyte!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful in my opinion. I love it. Helps me keep track got battery life and usage<br />Highly recommend it to anyone.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Couldn't believe my 27 year old had this on her &#34;Christmas Wish List&#34;.  Arrived before Christmas and was delivered in 100% great condition.  Movies of the &#34;classics&#34; are always great to have.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|CD from Piano Guys is amazing!!! Wonderful music, great ideas with piano and cello. I commend for each of you which like instrumental popular music :-)
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a great game.  The colors and textures are wonderful.  A great game to relax with any time you have a few moments.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book I loved how it shared a lot of his life and how the Valentine dance was with old people
B00138CYD4|4.0|It's a good album. Most of the songs are familiar. Can remember listening originally on LP, then cassette, then CD. Brings back alot of good memories.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is an inspiring story for all readers. I already loved the book less than half way through the story. I thank all should get a chance to read it.
0439023491|4.0|I am a huge fan of Rick Riordan's books and usually only him. Then it was Cassandra Clare but then I'd heard about the Hunger Games, read it and thought it was excellent. I finally read the second one, meaning it to be only a little reading material while on a trip during Christmas vacation. I didn't expect to like it so much. I finished it and was wondering why it had to end when it did because it was literally JUST GETTING GOOD!!! So now I'm thinking about reading the third book. I am the type to like only a couple certain authors because I like certain things. This book has maybe 6 or 7 out of 10-11. I am hard to please. This book did it for me. Thank you, Suzanne Collins for being an author and creating the Hunger Games trilogy. It was brilliant. Two questions though: why do the characters have such strange but interestingly pretty names? And two are they British? Ok thank you. Bye.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|The first two thirds of the book was great. But after that things got a little weird. First of all when Cortana gets transferred to the Pillar of Autumn. And then when Keyes gets on board, all calm and stuff,where's Noble six handing Keyes Cortana . And where's the Pillar of Autumn's emergency takeoff while Emile and six hold off the Covenant . Also I don't remember Master Chief getting Cortana,I remember six getting her from Halsey to take to Keyes to give to Chief. In fact I don't remember Master Chief popping up or even being mentioned in Halo:Reach at all.I say, if your going to write a book based on a video game franchise, make sure you get all your facts straight.
B0099G88BE|5.0|Recognized most of the songs, brought back alot of memories..... would recommend to anyone that likes old rock, that isn't &#34;tractor jockey&#34; music.....
B0035LJY6C|3.0|I was so anxious to watch this movie, remembering the &#34;Old Days&#34;.  A bit disappointed.  A lot of the same old, same old, with no new twists to it.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|This movie had no plot at all, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and if it didn't have some name actors it would never have even been watched.  The trailers were misleading as it looked like a fun movie and it was not!
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I was so excited to go pick this up at the post office today! I am a huge Kate Beckinsale fan, and this movie is so good! :) I wasn't able to find it in Walmart or Hastings, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon, I'd been wanting it for a while! Super excited!
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Watching The Avengers (which I purchased) gave me an appetite for more of the Black Widow.  This was good, but I rented it.
B009GX6SSK|4.0|like the crew as well as the setting of ncis los angeles season 4.<br />the christmas show was good. loved sending sam home to his family.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app in my opinion is good for people who do alot of traveling, it's easy to use and navigate your way through.
B005HSL626|5.0|AWSOME love this game it was recomended to me from a co-worker . I love the challange to get the fruit in groups as well as not hitting the bombs.
B00782O7IY|4.0|I bought this specifically because it was a silent movie and would go well on my Nook (its hard to hear).  Fits the bill.  Wish there were more silents for that purpose.
B000JML7EC|5.0|A fast and easy read that keeps you wanting more. Treasure island gives the more you want and keeps giving to the end.
B004I744AS|5.0|Yeah this thing is definately more than just a dictionary, there's just so much information here. You can choose different languages, it has the word of the day, quote of the day, etc etc. The overall layout is great and easy to follow. If you haven't downloaded this FREE app yet what are you waiting for.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Interesting plot. Did not see the twist coming at the end. Very good book for teens, easy comprehension and not too many details.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i finished reading this in 2days. amazing. heart wrenching. truth. lovely. charming. funny. delicate on the soul<br />i couldn't breathe at the end. literally. this story took my breathe away.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. Just exactly what I had hoped for. I use it almost every morning to plan my day. Thanks!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Stickman is fun and amusing.  You can enjoy it on the simple level of seeing your stickman animated.  And if you are looking for a challenge the you can play it as the game it is -- which gets harder as you progress. Overall it is great fun even when you blow yourself up.  My stickman may be  pitiful looking but you should see his friend!
1846467640|4.0|Unlike some of the other reviewers, I love the size because these books were purchased for a three-year-old and they are the perfect size for him. The books are sturdy and the pictures and story charming.<br /><br />An added bonus is the flip-side of each small book makes up a puzzle image of Peppa Pig's family.<br /><br />The only drawback to this purchase is the packaging wasn't great and the paper case holding the books got crushed. I hope the seller resolves this issue.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a really fun game although after I bought the full, the game was over. still it was eventful.
B0090XO57C|5.0|Product was shipped quickly and was an awesome gift. The Planet Earth Series is like no other. It is highly recommended
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A good book with unexpected twists, botanist your average romance novel. AND OF COURSE THE main guy is dreamy. Good!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Fun way to pass time if you're in a waiting room or bored to death.  Works well and plays as expected.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this app really helps me keep organized and put my stuff in different notebook and decorate them. I love this app
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good fast paced game, gets rather hard to get under 5 minutes, but keeps you playing for the goal. would recommend it for anyone who likes mahjong
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Now I can Skype with all my kids in other states and my best friend far away and her daughter in college! I've stepped into the 21st century!
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I only use ocean waves but love it for sleeping. If you use white noise this is a sound to try.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoy his writing. It is real, gritty and sometimes disturbing, just like life.  The historical aspects are very well researched ;and I liked the way the characters in the book interact with actual people; i.e. FDR, Churchill, Hitler. Looking forward to the third book!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|love it the effects, art clips, and all the stuff u can do with anything. Can share with anything easy. Should give it a try!!!!
145210655X|5.0|My husband gave this to our grown sons. They read it quickly and then had great conversation about some of the lines from their personal experience. They are all Star Wars Fans.
B009H5IS1W|1.0|Past episodes were more about catching a killer, Season 08 is more about gore.  I am very disappointed.  I am glad they did not make to many of them....it would be a complete waiste of money
0470913029|3.0|I'm sticking to this but loosely.  It's hard to find most of the meats recommended, so I'm just using the ones in the supermarket.  It's not exact, but it's working.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this movie!  I would watch it over and over again!  Fat Amy is the best!  Great girls night movie!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have had to delete and reinstall this app multiple times.  It keeps getting stuck &#34;loading&#34; my email.  I want the old version back.
1451688091|5.0|The book is absolutely amazing.  It shows sides of Lincoln that we never learned in school.  It makes for excellent reading.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Love this movie! Everyone should own this movie. It is a classic and we watch it every Christmas. You should watch it.
B007NESBK2|5.0|After disappearing from the music scene for almost 11 years, Sade has not lost a step. She is so absolutely beautiful and the concert blew me away as tears streamed down my face. I was really hoping that they filmed the concert for release later and they did. This is exactly what I saw when she came to Memphis Tennessee. The visual effects are the best I have ever seen, complementing each song perfectly. If you like Sade, this is a must to own. No matter whether you went to the concert, this will still blow you away, or you were unable, this is the best of all attempts to put an event such as this on film. It comes through perfectly. And you don't have to be a fan to be really impressed. My only fault is that her dress changes are not as beautiful as they were in Memphis Tennessee. I call it music to make love to, but after introducing my son he calls it &#34;F Jam&#34;! She is so sexy!
146500632X|5.0|My granddaughters wanted anything One Direction for Christmas.  This calendar was perfect.  Big and lots of nice pictures.  I'm sure as the months slip by their rooms will be adorned with the pictures.  Thanks again for providing all the things to make their Christmas from Grandma special.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book was for my 9 year old granddaughter.  4 stars was her rating.  She liked it enough to do a book report for school on it.
B005NNV73S|5.0|Husband wanted to reminisce with the songs on this old album.  He loved it.<br />Made his day.  Added to the library
B008PZ69Q6|2.0|Any hard core Elvis fan already has &#34;Live at Madison Square Garden&#34; and &#34;An Afternoon in the Garden&#34; on CD in their collection already.  The only thing for those of us who already own this material is the booklet that gives a lot of details about the concerts.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|such a good story :-D i couldn't put it down until it was finished. not for the light hearted. overall a great read
1610454812|5.0|I usually don't like non-fiction but this kept me captivated and I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  I bought 2 more copies for friends.
0765325950|5.0|Overall:  As a fan of the series as a whole, I found everything I could want in this final volume.  Obviously, this book is not for someone who has not read the rest of the series.  That aside, I recommend this book (and the series as a whole).  I felt that the end was fitting, emotional, and well written.  I have seen so many people writing negative reviews of the book because it isn't an ebook or because of late shipping.  I feel these are terribly unfair to the book as it was wonderful.<br />  Plot/completion:I felt that most subplots were wrapped up very nicely with nothing really left as 'oh man, how could he have not even mentioned character X?'  I felt the ending was very fitting and cathartic.  To see so many things come together after decades of teasing and waiting was amazing.<br />  Style/quality: The writing style does differ slightly from Robert Jordan, but that was to be expected.  Overall, Sanderson did a masterful job finishing a series that was not his own.  I never felt that his voice was terribly different from Jordon's.<br />  Conclusion: I thoroughly enjoyed A Memory of Light and highly recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This story is simply and beautifully written.  Each and every character felt real.  Their flaws and complexities made them easy to relate to and, for that reason, easily forgivable.  Chbosky masterfully crafts an in-depth study of our inner worries, struggles, and triumphs, while at the same time, endearing us to a host of lovable characters. Charlie, to some degree, embodies a piece of each and every one of us.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The good things about this movie have nothing to do with the original. I liked the geopolitical environment. Appreciated the message such an environment was trying to convey. But beyond that, I was just disappointed.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD...<br /><br />To me one of the cool things about the first one was that it took place on Mars, this one doesn't.<br />Secondly, and I don't think this is too nit picky. What affect would drilling a hole through the center of the earth actually have? I'm no geologist and the first thing that comes to mind is &#34;REALLY BAD IDEA&#34;. And if it is ok to do so they could have addressed in even the most minor way. Cause I'm sure I was not the only non-geologist/earth science person watching this.<br /><br />I could go on. But I won't.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I was a huge Zep-head in college and watching this DVD brings me back! Robert, Jimmy, JPJ and Bonzo Jr. absolutely nailed it at this 2007 concert in London and I am thrilled to have this opportunity to have a look in at this awesome show ... even if only from the confines of my living room. This is a must have for for Led Zeppelin fans! .... And, if in fact, this is LZ's final Swan Song --- it is truly a day to celebrate this amazing band one last time with this DVD/CD set.
0062014102|5.0|Worth reading for everyone with any amount of curiocity about the world.<br />Lot of good references. Fast paced and well written.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow,So intense. Tried to guess the ending,but never thought it would end like it did. Ready to get started on the third book. Great reading for most age groups.in
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Installed on my Kindle fire, works fine. No problems with loading more than 10 updates. It does only load a few at a time, but no serious pauses or delays, and it hasn't frozen once on me. I haven't really done much more, but I put off installing because of all the reviews saying you could load more than a few updates at a time.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is awesome.  I couldn't stop playing it!<br />I want to play it over and over!  Everyone should play this game!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett books are always good reading and very interesting. Helps explain how world war 2 came about along with interesting characters.
B009NT0I06|3.0|taylor is great,  i would buy her next cd.  she is very talented performer.  i will certainly pre buy her next cd
0071762345|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It's a great read that simplifies the world of social media in a language that you can understand. Novices will appreciate the straight forward and easy to apply concepts. Great job Dave!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. It would be better if you didn't have to collect so many items for quests or to charge collections.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I play one game daily and enjoy the odd bit and pieces of conversation others enter also.  I would recommend
B008966SIU|5.0|Listen with headphones--incredible! Yet another amazing album from a band that is not afraid to take chances. Definitely check it out!
B009G7ZYUO|4.0|This is almost 5 star stuff but there a perhaps too many repeats of the same songs. Of course these are great to listen too but could have at least been placed onto different DVDs to avoid 'overload'. Still RATM are too good to get too upset.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Purchased this for my niece who loves this series.  I bought it at a wonderful price during the holidays--best time to buy.
B001EO748M|5.0|This season was the best of the 3 I have seen so far . I loved this version of the story off Anne Boylen
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|it is fun and cool to use, also it has a bunch of tools like markers,stickers, anmd even an album to keep your pictures you create!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love this show. It is the best shot show on television. The cast, the acting, the cinematography are all amazing!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is my son's favorite show.  I was able to purchase it during the holiday season at a terrific price.  Planned to buy it anyway.
B005LAII12|1.0|I DID NOT LIKE THE STORY LINE--WHEN KIDS SEE THE TEDDY BEAR DOING POT & LAUGHING & HAVING A GOOD TIME THEY WILL BELIEVE IT--ALSO THE SUPER HERO GOT EXTRA STRENGTH BY DOING POT--THAT WAS TERRIBLE--I'M NOT A PRUDE BUT THIS WHOLE MOVIE STANK!!!!!
B0037B6Q66|5.0|Year 7 Book my Son says good book. Good start to the high school arena hope to have more good books like this
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and I'm so eager to start reading on the 3rd book! I can't wait to see the movie as well. :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. Mr. Grisham kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried for guess what Max was trying to pull off. It's a must read for any JG fan.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Does exactly what I expected it to do, glad that I could order on line rather than have to go to store to pick up
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Indispensable for people on the go. I have my chosen cities' accurate wheather at the touch of my finger.  Very useful!  I love it!

B004LROUNG|5.0|I've a JG fan and really enjoyed the book. The Litigators is funny and action packed, and will keep you coming back for more.
B003GSLX5Y|3.0|An ok book, poorly formatted, at least in kindle. Well intended, but the book is too academic in tone and tenor to hold the interest.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Good book and as always with N. Sparks, there are twists and turns. Believable but I was not a fan of how the character was not a character at all.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While this book was intended for a young adult audience, I felt that it is an outstanding book for all audiences.  The characters are all teens but the message could apply to anyone.  First book that I have read by this author but I will be reading other books by him.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I have a hard time of putting it down. My seven year old plays it sometimes. He likes to move everything around so I have to move them back where I had them. But at least he at least he is playing it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. I read it straight thru. not sure what else to say. But it touched me. Worth a read for sure.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|well it is a very good game great for passing time. but, there is some content that isn't for small children I myself was quite surprised to see what happened when you pit human an  human together so beware!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|This was my introduction to Mr Baldacci's work, and the Camel Club in general. It's an easy read, and goes pretty fast. It's tough to find a good stopping point in the book!<br /><br />The plot is great, and the story is sufficiently complicated which is what I prefer with a political thriller. There were some twists and turns and some unpredictable moments.<br /><br />One thing that stood out for me was how well the characters are carved out. I am always very particular about both character and dialog, because if it's bad it ruins the book for me. The author did an excellent job with this and made them feel real enough that you could focus on the story, which is a good one.<br /><br />Highly recommended especially if you like political thrillers.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|its a good game but they nag you from the start to buy gems!!! then there's this thing where one wrong click can cost you $100!!!!!!!!!!! later you need to use gems to buy ponies that you need to win!!! then they DEMAND that you go on facebook!! I'm too young to have a facebook!!! you want me to break the law?!?! fix these and this game will be fine
B007EZJKS2|5.0|Beautiful artwork and a engaging moving story. I suggest watching the movie as well. :) I watched it first then found this!
B005LAIISA|5.0|The item was  received on time and the disks  were of good quality, without noticeable defects. I have enjoyed the product.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Nice graphics and U I .  Easy for anyone to learn to get addicted to. Customization and talents take some grinding like most of these games do..
B005HSL626|2.0|I down loaded this game for our grand kids to play. They were real excited when they first started playing it, but got bored with it after a short time.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The item was  received on time and the disks  were of good quality, without noticeable defects. I have enjoyed the product.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Perfect, Awsome. My husband was so happy it hid them from the kids so no one would touch them.  He set up the sound system and blasted Stars Wars for days... Thank you
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Our grand children love playing this game. Even the 4 year old can play it and keeps here intertained for the longest time. It is a very cute game.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is pretty cool getting to creative your own characters and tools. some levels can be difficult and take some  thinking, but still not frustratingly difficult. one improvement would be to have a single pencil and the use of the tool depended on how it was drawn. for instance if an axe was drawn it would be an axe, a key would be a key, as opposed to having a separate pencil for every tool and a simple line or even dot will still create a usable tool.
B0094KTC6K|5.0|Beautifully done. Photography and sound top quality. Heartwarming story and Tim Allen' s narration was excellent. I loved this film.
B00A77II0U|5.0|had a lot of fun with this game. great story, excellent graphics. challenging but not frustrating. would like to play more like this one!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great story.  Very intense at times. I would recommend this who likes an easy read and a love story with a happy ending.
B003K16P3M|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been utterly consumed by a book and its characters. I've found myself literally itching to get some free time to see what's going to happen next. The characters and their development, the plot and pacing. Everything was just perfect. Definitely putting this book on my top five list
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My daughter started playing this game and wanted some friends, so I thought I would give it a try. We are both enjoying it now.
140120841X|2.0|Unfortunately, the artwork in this is really poor.  It may just be this printing, but the colors look really bad, and it's pretty difficult to even tell what is going on a lot of the time or which characters are saying what during conversations.  I also didn't find the narrative to be particularly interesting.  Go buy Locke and Key Instead.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great way to explore caves in France this summer, then the uneven sidewalks of Berkeley now on this cold, dark January night. Easy to turn on to quickly to find my keys or pjs when I don't want to switch on the light. Bright, white LED light. Favorite app!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is great. And its my favorite. Its fast and easy to download videos and mp3 onto your Kindle Fire. The best part is that once you have downloaded your songs/videos you can watch them without wifi. So you can bring it to school and watch videos and when you travel. I recommend this app to everyone who enjoys music! :) ~
014312093X|3.0|After reading  The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (another Le Carre book), I ended up being disappointed by this one in comparison.  I'm a bit torn because I did tear through it in a week and read the last half of the book today, so I obviously didn't hate it, but I don't plan to read the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br /> One thing I didn't like is that I think I'm missing a lot of cultural references and nuance because I'm not English and I wasn't alive in the 1970s.  I found this to be less of a problem in Spy Who Came In.  It sometimes felt like I was reading something in translation--and I'm well educated and well read.  There's much more spycraft jargon in this one that goes unexplained, which can also be frustrating.<br /><br /> But I think the biggest issue is much more is kept hidden from the reader in this book and the revelations that come out are ultimately unsatisfying.  In Spy Who Came In, we essentially know what the protaganist, Alec Leamas, knows (and a little bit more) and sort things out with him.  In this book, more of what George Smiley knows and what he is plotting is kept hidden from us until late in the book, and we're given only pieces of it.  We don't get to sort things out with George in quite the same way as we did with Alec.<br /><br /> On the other hand, perhaps the increased complexity of this book made it more difficult to follow and reason along with George Smiley.  Now that I know who the double agent is (which is the big mystery), I can think of some details that I missed at the time which ended up being important.  It could be that a more careful reader would get more out of it than I did.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I saw the author during a TV interview.  He impressed me with his sincerity so I just had to get the book. I purchased the Kindle edition for my PC.  I am glad to have read it.  It is a story that jives with many other experiences that most people don't know whether to believe or not.  But there is one thing that makes this experience special. The author is a neurosurgeon who did not believe in life after death.  With his knowledge and training, it just could not be possible--until he had a verified brain condition that could not have allowed him to have the experience he did.  It is not a long read but still compelling and thought-provoking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever!!!! I have It on Pc and its is lot better but I like it on kindle mainly because its original mineveaft it makes it harder to do thing's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so cool. I have the xbox edition and it cool to. But this one is you can take any where with your iPod or kindle.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|No performance issues on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, and hours of fun.  Music selection is wonderful and challenging. Recommend.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Bought this CD after hearing the music along with his story.  His music is such a reflection of the times in which it was written.  The music brings back very personal memories for me.  In fact, he was on Leno last night with a large string section accompanying him.  Apparently the documentary about him has been nominated for an Academy Award.  Anyway,  the string music was nice, but he seemed very much out of his element.  His music is his voice and his guitar.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|The premise of a love relationship between a human and mythical creature is not a new one.  However, Stiefvater manages to create characters that make you want the myth to be true.  Sam is the guy we all wanted to fall in love with in high school and Grace is the best friend we had in those days.  Though written for young adults, the book is just as compelling for older readers.  The story is really about how love changes all of us and makes us more appreciative of what it is to be human.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This reminds me of Azada the 1st one the Final approach mini game. It`s one of my favorites in that game but,this can be pretty hard.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I read this book for the first time some 20 years ago.  It has reminded me again and again how one can live a life of meaning even when it seems almost impossible to do so.  For a catholic striving to live  the life in the manner of Christ, it is most helpful and inspiring and compares with the best spiritual books that have guided me consistently.  It is a book that has always been on my list of favorite literary works and which I have shared with many friends to help them find meaning in life, too. The feedback has been consistent: a great book!. .
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Once again Cornwall doesn't disappoint. Once you start reading this you can't put it down. LOOKING forward to another Scarpetta Novel soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was wonderful..... she is a great author.  I would read more of her books. Definitely a series I would recommend.

B002RI9UBS|4.0|I thought it was very slow to start and took me awhile to get to the stage that I had to get back to it but from about midway i really got into and would say I reallt enjoyed it
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Bought it because it look fun and wanted to try something new and interesting today.  You should try it sometime.

B0091REZMW|4.0|I like how the game is designed to pace you, however,  you can pay to go faster. The game concept is fantastic using an intricatel story to lead you.
076115678X|5.0|Love this book because I have naturally curly hair and I have picked up so many tips on how to care for my hair
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this game with such a simple concept is very stimulating. It has multiple levels and many variables to make the game interesting as you progress<br /> So in short I love this game!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So maybe it was a messed up storyline, but very well written. Easy read. Loved every word. This book evicted every emotional response from me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great time waster!  Lots of fun. even the kids, under 10, can enjoy this game. easy to learn and great progression to harder levels.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|nice app with large viewing space ~ wish the comment box was a little larger. Like that it shows the new stories posted since started viewing and can touch to release those for reading.

B007THA4FI|2.0|In my opinion, J.K. Rowling is a fabulous writer. She did an amazing job of bringing a town to life in this novel. However, in her effort to move on from the series &#34;that shall not be named&#34;, she brought in every kind of sorrow, betrayal, profanity, and I felt very depressed by the end of the book. In fact, many of the characters situations are unresolved, as I guess real life is, but to me I felt like the author was going to extremes to stay away from what she is currently popular for. In fact, some of the teens are the same ages as the students her in other novels, but very worldly. It seems that in the whole town, not one family has a normal relationship and no one has a good parent/teen relationship.  I would not recommend this for a teenager as it would encourage some of the behaviors you wouldn't want them to have. I was REALLY disappointed with the plot but love her style of writing and the way she develops each character and reveals the story from their points of view.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.

0440418569|2.0|The usual problems with trilogy: the middle book sucks. It is nearly always boring, dull, slow, and really nothing more worth than to know what miniature action went on between the first and the final book of this series. This series managed to surprise me on that part.<br />The subtle knife was awesome! I mean, good balance, introductions of new characters, multiple peoples doing their \\"own work\\", and all of them coming together at the end, it was great.<br />The real reason why this book surprised me on this \\"out coming\\" is the fact that the first and the second book was the best really nice and all that, but the final book, the amber spyglass, was really dumb.<br />Not that its story was not interesting but the ending was extremely confusing.<br />I mean, it was mostly all about war! Lord Asriel's army versus the church and the authority, and in the end, it does not mention clearly about what happened to it, and how it affected the world. Everybody goes back to their world and live happily ever after? No! That is so wrong! We deserve to know more, and there are a lot more elements of the game in that which twists with the plot to make it even more confusing.<br />So, what can I say about recommendations. I mean, you cannot leave it, since it IS the ending of the dark materials trilogy, and we need to read it to finish the series, so I suggest you borrow from a library than buying, since in my opinion, is not worth keeping.
B001NE80P4|5.0|This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.

B003D5FDEC|5.0|This recording showcases one of the most, if not the most, talented guitarists that I have ever heard. I first discovered Joe Pass when I began snapping up as many Pablo LPs as my meager disposable income would allow. I think that even if you're not a huge jazz fan, you can enjoy the solo guitar work on this recording.
1849904251|5.0|As an avid Sherlock fan, this book gives me all the fan material I could possibly need.  The best part is the post-it notes John and Sherlock write to each other.
0765325950|1.0|After the reams of padded narrative over the years since the first few good books were released.  Now the shadow is lifted, because I don't have to waste good money on yet another bloated and ridiculous ripoff book.  Yay!  Harriet Jordan's decision not to release an e-book has freed me from my from decades long dysfunctional relationship with this series! Buying, reading, and then hating myself for it in the morning. Thanks, Harriet!
B008ENA74E|1.0|The story is okay but the writing is horrible. It does describe certain good insights in Goldman and I do share some of the experiences. A lot of the materials though, seem more like fiction than facts.<br /><br />I do not share the idea which the author keeps on promoting himself and saying how innocent he was among a group of scam artists. It simply can't happen. He was an ED and to get there, he had to step on certain number of dead bodies. If he was truly as senior as he claimed he was, I do not think he was as naive or pure as he described himself.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A must read for all you classic gamers and nerds like me out there lurking out there. Was a bit hesitant when it was recommended but I've read it twice since I downloaded it!
B002SSBD6W|5.0|Well worth purchasing and reading, Foer highlights issues that most of us already know about the food that we eat, but brings them to front of mind and poses thoughtful questions that are well worth considering when you sit down for your next meal
B00A757EFW|5.0|nice old game, grandkids dont exactly get it but is fun for us old timers need more words to finish
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another fitting part of Martin's series, can't wait for the next book! Well worth reading for fans of the series, or worth considering picking up for avid fantasy readers.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A novel showing the sweet hopes of fantasy reality can't ever portray. Fantastic. Incredibly heartwarming. Touching to any soul, even those incapable of sympathy
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE IN  FOREVER WAS SO THRILLED TO FIND SUCH A GEM!  THANK YOU!  AND THE PRICE WAS PRETTY AWESOME TOO!  =)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I found this book fascinating..the author really makes you feel like you're a part of the lives of the characters in the story. Having been a part of a family who survived a suicide it was a story that rang true for me. As always the suspense builds as it comes to a nail biting conclusion.
B009AVCAJ4|4.0|very bloody and some nudity and language. would not recomend for younger viewers. great characters and story. awesome fight scenes.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I got the game while it was free so I'm happy about that I saw a video its not a copy of minecraft this is an rpg so ill fry it out
B000065K6N|4.0|amazing animation, great voice acting and story. some blood and gore. recomended for all anime fans. not a long anime but not short

B00APUQJLO|2.0|Ok, so being a huge fan of Rob, i decided to give this a try as it looked pretty decent from the preview that i saw.  Oh, how wrong i was.  This was an awful movie in every sense, even the acting by Rob Pattinson was very forced and not natural as he usually is.  The ending also left a lot to be desired. Very dissapointed.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Ok,this game is really fun. One awesome feature of the game is that you can buy different clothing for Barry (the little running jetpack dude).<br /><br />There are levels during the game that you need to complete a certain amount of mmissions to complete the level. You earn a certain amount of money for each level you pass.<br /><br />Well I hope this review was very helpful and I will post more and more reviews as the days go by.
0425263916|5.0|This was suggested to me as i loved 50 Shades.  This however, was much better writing and the lead female, Ava, responded to situations a lot more like i would have done.  Really enjoyed the first two books and cannot wait for the 3rd!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This game is for all you smart geeks and video game geeks who are smart. If you like to play board an d strategic games this for you, too.<br /><br />The whole point of this game is to play one game at a time, not play multiple while on the same screen. What I am trying to say is that after you play a game, you can't play another one without going to the menu again after you already completed the game. What Optime could have done better at was to automatically start a new game after the opponent/you had already won.<br /><br />I will still write more reviews about my personal favorite things!!! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved the book It kept turning the plot around and around<br />gone Girl by gillian flynn<br />well written book<br />recommended to all my friends
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|The Descendants, which is a supposed comedy-drama film written and directed by Alexander Payne and based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Cummings, is actually a relatively heavy drama with a few funny scenes that focuses on relatively unlikeable characters, especially the two daughters but Matt (George Clooney) has his moments as well. In deciding on whether or not I find a film good or not I focus on three key elements in my decision, whether or not it has likeable protagonists, whether or not it's boring, and whether or not the film achieves in what it sets out to do, as in being funny if it's a comedy, being serious and dramatic as a drama, and being frightening as a horror film, it succeeds at being dramatic, and it succeeds in not being boring, but it fails as far as characters go, I didn't particularly care for any of the characters and because of this I could really care less about what happened to them. In fact, it isn't surprising that the wife cheated on the George Clooney's character because he was such a prick. The acting was good I suppose and I enjoyed the setting, but it added very little to the plot or story, this film could just as easily have taken place in California or even Florida. Despite taking place in such a beautiful, paradise setting the story is too dark and serious, which further weakens the appeal of this film. The little side plot regarding the land issue with Matt's family felt forced and completely unnecessary, it seems to be there only to justify the title of the film. A disappointment all around.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome get it! I'll just fill up th  rest of the space now hfhxjdncksndkfjrhdifndbfjri dismemberment djdnnrjrbrjrkkrj .
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read.  No nonsense writing that  doesn't oversell the tactical part. Thankful too that we didn't have to hear about his time BUD/S.<br />Lays out the high level details of a fascinating mission.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|More of the same from Grisham. Its not fresh meerly a rehash of numerous past works. His editor must require him to crank out scripts
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not read a Stephen King book in years but picked this one because the time travel theme caught my attention.  The story really grabbed me from the start and I lost a lot of sleep because I just could not put it down.  The description of life in the 1960's brought back thoughts of sights, sounds, and tastes that were stored away in my mind long ago.  For readers who think Stephen King's stories are only about monsters, this book will be a pleasant reminder of what a great story teller he has been for many years.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Keeps you reading, expecting more, being surprised to say the least, as the story takes turns that are not what you!re expecting!  Loved the gated house scene...can't wait to find out how it will tie into their lives!
B000L53D4O|5.0|Fun for our grandkids and easy for grandpa to put together.  Great for the little ones just learning to walk.  I would highly recommend it.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Great band...great album!  Love everything they do either with the band or solo projects.  You'll recognize the hits on this CD.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really like David Baldacci's books and this one did not disappoint. Could hardly put it down. The plot just keeps thickening until the very end. I would recommend this book.
B004GYY714|4.0|Love to listen to the local radio and some of the other stations too. I can use it at work with the wifi
B00884GR0W|3.0|For some reason the control feels a bit off but works great and is pretty deep when. Ive played for hours and hours. Only sad thing is its the fotd and I paid for it.. oh noes the developer got to eat some ramen that day.
B0089BSLUS|5.0|I was first introduced to Antony and the Johnsons when I was linked to the &#34;Cut The World&#34; music video a little less than six months ago. Instantly, I felt like I was listening to the work of a master because of the haunting, alluring timber of the instruments combined with the great vulnerability and power of Antony Hegarty's voice. In a musical culture often, and increasingly, populated by narcissistic and negative lyrics, Antony's work calls attention to important, timely issues of our day like gender equality and peace with truthfulness and optimistic poeticism. And even if they are cliche for some, the way they are presented in the musicality of the album breaths new life and urgency into them. At some points, such as during the climax of &#34;The Cripple and the Starfish&#34;, Antony transcends the medium and enters into the listener's soul. He certainly did that for me, and I hope the same for others.
B00846REIS|4.0|Read this one in three nights. Will most definitely keep your  interest up.  Can't wait to tee ad the next one
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The laughs are very few in this one. The ending is cheesy as hell, the intro narration is boring, and the film lacks any real laughs. The only reason it's getting a second star is because Mark Wahlberg was actually funny for a change.
B00328R21C|4.0|My 7 year old son really enjoyed putting this together with his Dad. I like a toy that takes concentration and patience. It also is good for building skills.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Finally, a great book to read. I was really getting tired of reading all of the trashy romance fiction. Then I was asked to go see the movie based on the book, could not go to the movie but found the book on Amazon. This is a wonderful book that I have actually read twice. I know I have no desire to see the movie, it sounds too different with the time frames. All in all, this was a great read- just read it for yourself and you will see. One of my top ten favorite books of all time.
B000ZELISO|5.0|My kids love this, it was a xmas gift for them and they wanted the complete set of movies.  happy

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I downloaded this game for my son's nabi2 and he says he loves to play it.  he is 6 and likes it &#34;because it glows&#34;.  I can't give any other details since i have not played it.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|We absolutely loved the movies.  They came very quickly and in great shape.  We were able to watch all of them in succession and ejoyed 3 nights of great movies.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I purchased this for my 6 year old son's nabi 2 and I love to play it.  Only downside is the pop up to buy things.  Hate those, and I already spent money on the game, so stop having them pop up, I am not going to spend more money on the advertisements.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Can't believe Matthew agreed to play this role.  Very disappointed in movie.  I will never be able to eat another chicken leg without thinking of Killer Joe though - uckk!
B0000669JL|5.0|This CD one of the greatest if all time. Bob Marley was ahead of his time. A compilation of some of his best songs.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It seems rare to find writting that has believable characters and situations that also draw you and make a page turner.  Kudos to Hugh Howey for the excelent writting.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Better than the older version with more violence and a darker.  Would watch it again.  Hope they make a sequel.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A straight forward look at what it is to be different and incurably sick. A love story as touching and tragic as Romeo and Juliet.
B005EPFA8I|2.0|Werner Herzog injects WAY to much Werner Herzog into this documentary. If he had just shut up and let the principals speak about this astonishing discovery - which really does count as one of the world's great works of art - this would be an engrossing documentary. My advice: turn the sound off (since the scientists all speak French so you can just follow along by reading the subtitles).
1250027624|5.0|Loved every page.  The highlights for Season 3 were not &#34;spoilers&#34; since they had been rampant in print journalism, but this book was an excellent background of the series creator and each of the main characters
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I've bounced my Kindle Fire on the floor a few times and credit this case for preventing any damage. On the other hand, the foldable lid that's meant to hold up the Kindle is a joke.  You have to be VERY careful not to nudge it or the thing collapses. After a year, the elastic band is starting to lose its elasticity which currently is no big deal but I'm concerned that eventually it will be useless.
B0026SERTY|3.0|It's a fun movie, a bit campy, well thought-out, and full of pretty faces. Definitely something I have to be in the mood for, but I like it.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Packaged well and all arrived ahead of schedule!  Beautiful songs...author did a wonderful job of painting the picture with music!
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Let me start off by saying I refuse to pay for an app to sync with Google Calendar when the built in calendar SHOULD. I have multiple calendars to manage all my events, and only my primary calendar syncs with the built in calendar. I researched apps that were free and synced with Google Calendar and tried Jorte because I liked the interface. I can get my multiple calendars to show up on the Jorte web site, but not on the app. That makes the app useless. I'm keeping my data on the web site and we'll see if they push out an update that fixes this. Highly disappointed.

B0016BPWNM|5.0|Great fun for the whole family although it can be a little scary.  Jim Henson's muppets star in this enchanted tale as well as David Bowie.  David Bowie does an excellent job.  The muppets are fun although some are scary to younger audiences.  Happy ever after.
B004WKI204|4.0|I love Tina Fey and this book is a fun read of her opinions and real life experiences with 30 Rock, SNL and being a mom.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was not a really well known book or author but the reviews I read got my attention enough for me to give it a try.  I couldn't put it down.  I flew thru the entire series.  enjoyed every sentence.
0425252868|5.0|\\"A Higher Call\\" is destined to become a classic among the books that describe the war in the air above Europe in WWII. Not only do we get the usual insight into the 8th Air Force Bomber groups, but we get the unique perspective of the war from a decorated German fighter pilot as well, and the hardships he endured. Most importantly, the pre and post war personal lives of the pilots involved tell a wonderful heartwarming tale of families, and eventual friendships! A must read for WWII history buffs, and anyone else who would just enjoy a fantastic story!
1419705849|5.0|very good book my boys love this .i want to buy the whole serious of this book it is very funny
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|Enjoyed played it.  I would recommend this for someone possible wanting to learn to play.  Not ecactly what I had in mind.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|a little flimsey.Appears cheap no coverage for the front of my kindle.not to much protection.But i guess for the price it will do a good job

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic series!  Watched the entire season is two nights.  Maggie smith is just wonderful, as well as Jim Carter and all of the other staff
B004QJGF46|5.0|I have seen every kid movie ever made at least 100 times, since i have a 5 year old and a 2 year old. My kids love this movie and I must admit I do too. I always hope when its movie time they ask to watch this one.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What can be added to describe the true literary genius of these story tellers. This was a masterpiece of intertwined lives, personal tragedies and devious long term plans of biblical proportions. The canvas was stretched, the paint applied and the story emerged, magnificent.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Enjoyed this story much better than the movie and I LOVED the movie!<br />Fast paced, held my interest and finished it right away.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I found w/e a film made with  true artistic sensibilities as of Madonna as artist. The parallel lives made it relatable and relevant, as I believe the story of the Wndsors is generally. Sotheby's is always fascinating when depicted.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Almost as good as the first book.  Too bad that we lost such a good writer.<br />Am just now starting the next book in the trilogy
B00015YVD6|5.0|This is a great movie and arrived on schedule. I would use your site again to order not only films, but other items!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The movie is better than the book. He talks too much about animals in zoos. I mean too many words. I thought he would never get off this track. Once on the raft, it gets more interesting.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great movie! Keeps you constantly in suspense. A great love story which I could watch again and again. Highly recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this series but after hunger games I had to keep reading. Good job Collins.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|!!!! So much better than the movie. Easy read but so much substance. Really good book, highly suggested for all
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Glad I found this app as it has taken the guessing out of my new fire hd. Let's you know how long you have to use Everything and how long to recharge.  Very accurate app.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Overall this is a great record. It has what makes Soundgarden sound so good: songwriting from the other band members. This is what makes the music so interesting in my opinion.<br /><br />Like most of Cornell's vocal melodies, you need to listen to them a few times to \\"get the hang of them.\\" That's a good thing to me because he doesn't typically go for the middle-of-the-road melodies, which I like.<br /><br />Parts of the album remind of \\"Down on the Upside,\\" while others remind me of much older stuff. It's not a rehash for the fans by any means, though. Lot's of new sounds here.<br /><br />It's a good, solid, album that can stand on it's own.<br /><br />Popular rock/metal music coming out today doesn't really do anything for me. I dig for good bands when I can, but I only have so much time to do that. When a band that I have liked in the past puts out something good, it's refreshing and welcomed.<br /><br />~Slick
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|thanks for the option of this!  it is sooo much easier to use amazon for catching up on my series.  It is super fast reliable without having to download a bunch of toolbars. Thanks Amazon!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Amazing!  A thrill ride from start to finish.  The ending is totally unexpected.  Blake had a wonderful character.  A definite page turner.
B009E9R2OK|2.0|Read carefully. This is a non-video medium which sounds fine, but there is no video. Then there is the reality of it is only read in a Blu-Ray player. i.e. no DVD or CD device will read the disc. Poor if not deceptive marketing. Truly disappointing after thinking &#34;I can't wait to see the concert which I will never experience in person&#34;.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|very catchy and moved along with no drag. very good plot and beautiful acting by all .  great realistic and the family said it was the best film they had viewed in years
0374214913|4.0|A great book for anyone who loves old-school bookstores, Google, or both. An epic quest to solve the mystery of what, exactly, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is hiding with its unusual bookish types that come in at all hours of the day or night to borrow books from a special coded book selection. The ending is a bit disappointing, but also somehow fitting. I won't spoil it for you, but you'll probably see what I mean when I say that solving epic mysteries usually ends up rather mundane in the end. Does that mean you shouldn't make solving riddles and puzzles your life's quest? Not at all. But sometimes you may not be happy with what you find, and just like everything in life, you can't always get what you want - but if you try sometimes you get what you need.<br /><br />Recommended for the bookish, those who dream of immortality, and adults looking for a Harry Potter fix that doesn't involve wizards or magic.
0345803485|1.0|I have to admit I enjoyed the first few chapters due to such a risky storyline and how descriptive everything was, but it began to repeat and got boring. I did read all three books but not because of me enjoying it, I kept hearing that it got better and the story line became better. Lets just say it did NOT develop at all. The sex scenes became boring and I felt like they were repeating over and over after awhile (I even began skipping pages at a time when the sex scenes popped up). Also, the author would repeat the same words over and over, it became tiring (inner goddess is one of the best examples). It disgusts me that this is a best seller, has out-sold Harry Potter, and they plan on making a movie...do you mean PORN?
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I originally ordered the print version but it didn't ship after a couple weeks (live in the US), so I cancelled that order and ordered the Kindle version.  It is very well done!!  I've read it through once and can't wait to try out some of the programming that it details in the book.  Great for a beginner like me!!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Kind of a predictable ending though.  Still a great read.  Will read more books by this author.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is just like to one we've always played.  It would be nice to have some sound effects also.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|This movie has volgur humor that is not appropriate for kids.  It is not work wasting your time watching and is not good for kids.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good color selections. patterns and sound effects. I like that you can turn off the music if needed. But need to be able to turn off other sound effects.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Very good DVD and very good price. It was received in reasonable time and I like anything Andre Rieu does.
0979019710|5.0|It took me less than four hours to read the entire book, because it is that engaging. The writer uses such a personable writing technique that I not only could relate well to the text, but I felt like I had known Hal for years, just by absorbing the life changing words he wrote. It truly isn't often that a piece of literature can alter your life, but I have 1000% conviction that this one WILL alter yours. It will make you not only WANT to be the best version of yourself, it will ignite a fire within you to actually BECOME the best possible you! It's simple, understandable, easily implemented and will make EVERY SINGLE DAY FEEL LIKE CHRISTMAS! You will be so excited to hop out of bed and get moving in the morning, that the amount of time you actually need to sleep will decrease. It's all in the beliefs you hold about what you need! Change your thoughts, change your life. I am so incredibly happy I was able to read such an awesome, exhilarating and all together inspirational piece of work. If you don't purchase it, you're missing out on something that could potentially forever change the way you think about your life and how you are living it. We all have it within us to be great, JUST DO IT! :) Buy the book and find out just how amazing you really are. I promise, it is WELL worth it.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN........<br /><br />If you can keep track of the characters you will enjoy this book.  That's all I'll say.
B007THA4FI|4.0|All in all, a great book. You just have to be patient in the beginning, because there are so many characters involved. Once you reach the point of knowing who they are,  the book takes off and keeps you guessing until the very last page.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful characters and incredible plot twists ! Could not put it down ! Page turner and so well written I'm in love with the story
B00846REIS|5.0|I read 50 shades trilogy first and loved it. I'm loving this one even more and can't wait until the third one is released I hope she continues the series. I love it and recommend to everyone
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because.it is so funny and the illustrations were awesome I don;like this book I love it so much
0765325950|2.0|I am a HUGE fan of Brandon Sanderson but I was really disappointed in this book. The ending was VERY predictable. It was what fans on the forums have been predicting for years. It was sad to see beloved characters die, but the ending was very weak. It could have been ALOT better.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It was exciting and action packed and the last 15% was dynamic.  I feel anyone who reads this novel will enjoy it.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Great story. Had a hard time putting it down! Can't wait for the movie!! Will definitely read again! Highly recommend it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|It was exciting and I enjoyed it very much. I have read all of his books and he has not lost any of his talent.

B004OT8HJO|5.0|Me and my husband bought this set for our collection. Took us about 2 hours to set up. Its another amazing star wars Lego set. Its durable and so much fun.... not just for kids :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It is so full of surprises and emotions!  It is a must read for all.
B00935KWWO|5.0|Ive been using this app on the kindle fire for months without any issues, it runs extremely well, never any freezes or shut downs. Im able to edit my complete profile from it, and customize like crazy; I can highlight whomever with any color of my choosing which makes it easier to spot if Im looking for someone specific. The built in browser makes accessing links real easy. I've used MANY others and this is by far the best.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The credits lose if u quit during a match or sometimes when u leave from the lobby u lose 2000 credits there is a decent amount of ppl on. U can prestige I believe. I just wish they had headquarters or demolition. They do have 8 or 7 game modes and they are all fun ranking up is fun and semieasy I bought it 2 days ago and am rank 24 outta fifty BUY THIS GAME REALLY FUN BESIDES THE FEW FLAWS
B008MEM24S|5.0|its a lovely update to my favorite kindle fire app and I love to show it to my friends they picked it right up
B003ODIZL6|3.0|wish it told u more specifics but it doesnt wish it had words in different languages but it does give great definitions. They are awsome and my number one dictionary.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Bought it for my wife and she thinks its great. Lightweight well bulit and the price was right. Would recomend to friends.
B00ARAO720|5.0|The trailer doesn't do it justice.  It truly is a good action movie with a great story, cast, stunts, editing, music, and directing.  I was surprised at how entertaining it was.  I'm certainly glad I rented it and I eneded up adding this one to my video library.  Although you might expect it to be somewhat predictable, there is enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It isn't as simple as being able to ride a bicycle, and many are getting an education or starting a business.  On the street there is danger everywhere, and it may not be from a speeding car.<br />A bike courier finds himself harassed by a police detective wanting an envelope he picked up for delivery.  As the story unfolds we see there is the life of a small child at stake weighed against a cop willing to do anything to pay off a gambling debt that could cost him his life.  The courier is also being chased by the bicycle police for causing an automobile accident.  What may start out as some background on the daily life of a bicycle courier goes far deeper and makes you realize the kinds of things they carry from point a to point b may be life changing.  When I showed this to the wife and stepdaughter they enjoyed it too.  I hope they make a sequel.<br /><br />Recommmendations: [[ASIN:B003VCOQW2 Cellular]], [[ASIN:B008GOG98Y Breaking Away]], and [[ASIN:B00003RQKO Chill Factor]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B007THA4FI|5.0|Obviously, people can't see amazing writing if it slapped them in the face.  This book was crafted perfectly.  It is dark, I'll give them that, but it shows the underbelly of society in a small town, the politics, the hatred and apathy of people and how death affects them all.  It is tragic, but at the same time eye-opening.  I could identify with several of her characters, and they were all developed wonderfully.  People who couldn't get into it or couldn't understand it are missing the point.  This isn't meant to be a happy Harry Potter book.  It's an adult novel and it's about life.  Real life.  I guess I understand the book better because I, myself, have known tragedy, and I can relate to this.  It isn't boring to me, and the people aren't completely unlikable.  They're meant to be real people, and I commend J.K. Rowling for creating such a great story.  Her talent is immeasurable.  If you like Twilight, 50 Shades of Grey, or other terribly written, garbage literature, you probably won't like this.  It's actually good.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this remake of Dredd.  Now although the first [[ASIN:B004IDG97S Judge Dredd]] was a bit comical I still enjoyed it.  I would imagine this version might appeal to more that like the books or good action drama movies.  I was glad to see Karl Urban ([[ASIN:B002NWQKAC Doom (Unrated)]],[[ASIN:B001BR7CYS The Chronicles of Riddick - Unrated Director's Cut]]) cast as Dredd.  I think he is a great actor and he had the right face, voice, and acting to carry this role off well.  After viewing it as rental I want to own it.<br /><br />CA Luster
B005LAII80|5.0|If you like action, I would highly recommend this movie. Don't let fact that the Stallone version was awful stop you from seeing this one.
B005MMJ84K|2.0|Okay, so in the interest of giving the writer the benefit of the doubt, I am going to give this book three stars, because she did a good job with the writing, technically speaking. the prose was good, and the characters (mostly) were solid. ish. Here is the reason I couldn't give this five stars: If you are going to write in the dystopian genre, there is already massive pressure to run with the big dogs, or not run at all. Yes, yes, I know it's taboo to compare to The Hunger Games, but hey, that's the standard, and it's what the dystopian genre has to live up to now.<br /><br />But did there have to be such a massive and dramatic change in personality that we the readers didn't really know or like the heroine we fell in love with? Yes, she was unceremoniously dumped into a much rougher living situation in the Wilds. Yes, she thinks Alex is dead and gone. (Did she even go back to look though? No.<br />So that turns those emotions as flimsy as her secondary \\"romance\\" which I will get to in a minute.)<br />Lena's personality and to a large extent her outlook on life are all roses and peaches in the beginning of the first book.<br /><br />Which is fine, she doesn't know any better. She comes to change and apparently be a better individual with the help of Alex, who gives her something even better than all those contrived make out sessions and ab-sicle moments, making him a worthy love interest in my eyes.<br />(Mistake me not, I enjoy a good ab-sicle as much as the next girl. Just not ones that are so predictable and slightly ridiculous that I wanted to gag a little, then swoon.) Alex gave Lena the gift of poetry, albeit rather briefly.<br />But the fact that she had never heard anything like it before and that he apparently had been waiting his whole life for someone to say those words to makes it even more amazing that it ordinarily would be.<br />I applaud our Authoress for that brief, shining moment of something other than hormones. And, coming to that conclusion, what did Dear Julian give her in this book? Zero privacy during her shower with the Rats (EEEWWWWW!!!!!!) and more hormonal wreckage. He might be a ripped teen guy, (How did he get all those muscles by the way? We don't know.<br /><br />He just has them, as per the creedo of male love interests. At least Alex had a reason. *massive eye roll*) but Julian has the brain of a twelve year old kid. I really, really, REALLY tried to like Julian, or at least tolerate him  until he would just go away, but Noooo, he had to go all gushy touchy feely on us.<br />It feels to me like instead of sticking with one Hero until we could really and truly fall hard for him, she kills Alex off, the poor fellow, gives us some other guy we don't want instead, and then resurrects poor Alex just so he can suffer some more at the hands of what is evidently now a mandatory Love Triangle. (I know what you're thinking, \\"What Alex comes back?! WOOT!\\" But no, it's not woot, because he isn't really the person he used to be either, and I have a feeling that in book three we will bear witness the all-too-common scenario where the once adoring first love interest becomes a shriveled angry thing who is all hate-y all the time.)<br /><br />In this book, I couldn't really like Lena anymore, because she changed so much that I didn't have a reason anymore to like her. So, then why, you might ask, the three stars? Because among the endless sea of \\"Bla Bla Bla Julian Bla Bla, Alex is dead, too bad Bla Bla,\\" There was (just like in the last book) a single shining moment of true raw, emotion that I could empathize with. Without putting any really important spoilers herein, Our dear Raven gets the academy award for most convincing and heart wrenching moment. My Heart hurt with her during her story of Blue and the scene after that. I actually liked and enjoyed Raven more in this book than I did Lena.<br /><br />Read it and see, but seriously, get it at the Library. It's not worth your cash.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the way Harry Bosch digs into each and every nook and cranny to find clues.  He is determined to solve crimes that have been forgotten.  He feels for the victims and their families.  Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and he never ceases to amaze me in his books.  They seem so realistic!  If it is a Michael Connelly book you can be sure it will be very good.  I would reccomend this book to all my friends who love to read and also to those who don't!  This book will capture non-readers and ensure that they will keep on reading as another form of enjoyment!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|not bad... for a cheap nockoff! this thing is like off brand minecraft but twenty times worse! dont bother getting this demo, its not worth your time. it isnt even all cubes!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves heartfelt and emotionally moving reading! The pact will definitely get your heart pumping and you won't be able to put it down!

B009YQJ322|4.0|Lionsgate's DREDD has proved worth the wait, especially<br />when you consider the ancient Sylvester<br />Stallone 1995 effort.  Stallone's film was silly<br />fun: colorfully violent. In many ways it did capture<br />the spirit of the helmeted lawman.  The only trouble<br />was that Sly wore that iconic Dredd helmet for only<br />twenty minutes, then discarded it for full facials for<br />the rest of the movie.  And we, who'd grown up with<br />the \\"faceless\\" Dredd of the 2000 AD comics, were not<br />amused.<br /><br />This DREDD - which received next to no publicity -<br />is the \\"real\\" thing; at least it's what we<br />post-2000 AD fans have become familiar with.  Gone is<br />the humor (save perhaps a couple of subtle digs from<br />our judge).  This is a lean, mean tale of Dredd<br />taking blonde Anderson out on her first street patrol<br />and both becoming prisoners in the ruinous Peachtree tower.<br />There they have to face the scarred Ma-Ma who rules<br />the 200 story building as her own kingdom, and who is<br />flooding Mega City One with the drug Slo-Mo.<br /><br />The director's kept all things Dreddy.  An almost faceless<br />Karl Urban is gruff, perhaps human; Anderson, his student, is<br />destined for a different department (Psi).  Everything<br />is dark, everything is Dredd.  Let your eyes drift from the action,<br />and you'll see hints of Dredd's past: a \\"Chopper\\" grafitti,<br />\\"bent\\" Judges, block wars.<br /><br />It's a worthy flick, a good no-nonsense story. For once<br />the \\"extras\\" show us quite a bit more than the usual fluff<br />stuff.  I particularly liked the nearly fifteen minute<br />\\"history\\" of Dredd, featuring tons of art and comments by<br />early Dredd artists Carlos Ezquerra (first to draw<br />the lawman), Brian Bolland (the \\"best\\" artist), and comments<br />by John Wagner (one of the original writers).<br /><br />I suppose only a true Dredd enthusiast will really<br />enjoy this (it has a great ending); but for a different kind of<br />thrill, why not spend an hour and a half in Mega City.<br />At least you'll come to appreciate The Law - if you<br />survive.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|It's alright. I'm a big pinball buff and have always been pretty good at it. I've often attracted crowds around me, amazed at the levels I could reach in one game. This game doesn't have that same excitment of &#34;Oh my God&#34; I can't believe I made it this far type of factor. No matter how I fight to keep the ball up in the game, it slips right through and have to start over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This liberally leaves you hanging in by a thread! You literally want to  go and read book 3 as soon as you finish this book! Definitely a recommendation from me! Going to get book 3 now...
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's cute, I'm all about saving animals and love to help preserve endangerd species. I also enjoy winning over the bad guys *Poachers*, but the energy bar for that game is entirely too short for all that they require you to do to advance in levels.SOme of us don't have boocoo bucks to keep spending on certain products to keep the energy up.
B003954I9C|5.0|I'm surprised at how much I enjoy this album. I'm glad I took the time to listen to it. With songs such as \\"London,\\" \\"sincerely yours,\\"  and \\"hate it when you're gone,\\" this album deserves to be heard! Aj's voice is amazing. Give it a chance. :)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Everything was so vididly potrayed and so amazing to &#34;see&#34; that I was constantly surprised.<br />This book will linger in my thoughts, like a dream, for a long time.<br />Do not give up on it until you have a chance to really get into the book.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I love this movie! So does my husband, and he hates movies. It has become a true classic during the holidays in our house!
B000YAA68C|5.0|I love this movie! It came right on time. The DVD works great, it does not freeze. Watched it 5x already :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great enjoyed reading the book and also read the next 2 you just did not want to put it down and when it ended you wanted to know what happened next
B000NY12LO|5.0|Within the first couple of pages this book had me hooked. The weaving of the characters lives and the way the story was told was mesmorizing.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I have always loved cats and there are days when you just know that the cat is truly plotting against you. This book was fantastic, I just wish it was longer, so I could keep laughing.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|If your into intricate and detailed science fiction, this one is for you. I've read this book a number of times, and pick up something different every time. This book is a great place to start in the world of Dune. Frank Herbert's son picked up all of his notes and published a number of prequels, sequels, and a couple in the middle of Frank's original 6 books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|love  it , finished it in a couple days it's a very good book to continue the series and this book would make a awesome movie I hope they make a movie for every so for book in the series
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I loved this book! I hope that Mrs. James will continue this series although I doubt it.<br />I loved this book not because of the sexual aspects but because of the story.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Other than the map being slow to load/animate, an excellent app for up to date weather.  I paid 10 bucks for a weather app that's half as good as this, uninstalled it and got this one.
0061124958|5.0|Nothing better for listening and comprehension skills than to have a book read to you as a child.  It forces little people to hone their imaginations.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very impressed. This app works much better on my kindle fire HD than on my Android RAZR, however. I recommend this app.
1419701533|5.0|The price was right for the collection and having them in a box was appealing. My daughter loves the books. It was a perfect gift for her.
B006R1T40I|5.0|This album was worth waiting for. I`m a big fan and one her song`s were played at my wedding in the church.<br />She just gets better and better
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved every second of this book!!!!!  Couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end!  Broken and put back together again by true love!
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Didn`t no them in Denmark, but how they can play and sing. Hope they will go here for concerts maybe in the festival season
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. More people should read it to really understand what they go through and respect all members of the military.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|Just so nice to hear two great artists still alive and kicking. They really make each other better although they are perfect songwriters by them self.
141659521X|5.0|Ordered it only a few days before Christmas and it was wrapped and under the tree on Christmas Eve!! Whew. Excellent condition- I know my nephew will enjoy it.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This film is a lot of fun - we enjoyed it and our seven and nine year old girls enjoyed it immensely.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading my first Colleen Hoover book Slammed, I was super excited to read the follow up Point of Retreat, which I didn't even expect!! As soon as I saw she had another book out it was a no brainier for me!!! I \\"live\\" the way her characters come to life, and there were also a few unexpected twists at the end!! I would totally recommend this book!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved downloading onto iPad and watching whenever/wherever. Season 2 of Downton Abbey is as addicting as Season 1. Now on to Season 3!
B000063K2W|5.0|no other statement required,joan crawford,norma shearer what else needs to be said.also shipped to my home super fast.if you havent seen the new one,watch this one first!!!
B000FA675C|4.0|It was definitely a great read. Had a lot of symbolic references and I can see why so many people were against it. It does make you open your eyes and see the symbolism around you
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I knew what I was getting myself into when I started reading this book.  I had seen it pop up all of a sudden across many blogs and it wouldn't stay away so I finally gave in a read it.  I knew it was going to be an emotional challenging read but I found my self dragging my feet to finish it.  Not because it wasn't amazing but because I didn't want to let myself feel what the author was going to put me through.  I wanted to `live' in the happy, surprising and angsty moments and not have to face the reality of it all.  I knew it was coming but I found myself thinking as I was reading the final chapters that maybe, just maybe I would be wrong.  Well I wasn't and as much as I wanted to punch something and scream at my IPad I found myself thankful for the courage and the level of emotion that this author gave me.  This book will stay with me forever and I am grateful that the author didn't let me fool myself but made me read every last word and come to acceptance.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This cpu is great, it 3x fast then my old amd one. Can do absolutely anything with this cpu. I'm glad i got mine on sale for $180.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Its not just about sex and porn like situations, this book actually has a good story line to it.
0920668372|5.0|Simple, real, loving. I have cried every time I read it.  Teach your kids the real love a mother can feel. Just base of a true story...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was fun and a page turner to see what was going to happen next.  Light reading and a great way to spend a few hours with my Kindle
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I would have gave it 5* if you could just type in a word and it would go to it but instead you have to guess the page # (which takes a while) but otherwise it is a very helpful book<br />-Mckenzie
B00969PR18|4.0|I love this app! it's just like the navigation app for my phone.  I can search, find directions and locate places by categories. Very useful indeed! Thanks for designing it!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I stumbled across it, and I'm so glad I did. You can customize your notebooks, add pics,email them and their perfect for just about anything. Only thing I don't like is that I cant have more than one title on a page when I only use half a page. Other than that, this a perfect app!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Understand that I have a great appreciation for the surreal and non narrative structured films of our age. I am an avid David Lynch and Charlie Kaufman fan so these types of films tend to appeal to me. However Cosmopolis was a lifeless film, it was an audiobook with pictures. I was 30 minutes into the film asking myself when will the film actually begin. The acting is monotone and when I mean monotone I mean the actors including the main character all speak like the agents in the matrix, there is no chemistry or engagements between the characters, almost like they could all be CGI talking to blue screens, most of the time they are not even looking at one another while speaking. I understand capitalism is a machine and that could be a minor explanation for the dialogue but it just does not engage the viewer one bit. It kind of reminds me of the film Waking Life but lacking in any substantial existential realizations. Paul Giamatti's 15 minute performance at the end was suberb and probably left a lasting impression on some to give it a favorable review. However this performance does not amend the fact that you just spent an hour and a half listening to dialogue as monotone as a GPS indicator and watching actors just reading lines out loud as if they were reading the script for the first time. The artistic qualities of this film have eluded me, if one finds mathematics to be an art then this film may appeal to you otherwise this film is 2 hours of wasted existence. To sum it up it is like eating a box of unfrosted shredded wheat for dessert.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This story definitely kept my attention and I enjoyed it. But is really is a chic book, an easy read for the beach. Nothing deep or new but your typical &#34;love&#34; story with a twist. Pretty much saw the ending coming so there was no surprise there. You really can keep one step ahead to know what happens next. Enjoyable though if you are wanting a quick story before reading something deeper.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent! Loved continuing to follow these characters. I can't wait to finish the series. The whole book was a page turner. I couldn't put it down.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Movie was pretty good.<br />a lot of digital pixilation in the video.  The stream of the vieo did not come thru very good.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|My son has bought many of the ALex Rider books....he reads them diligently and gets AR points at school.  Big bonus:  they keep him entertained long enough to stay off the video games!!!
0316069434|5.0|Harry Bosch is in the \\"Open/Unsolved\\" division when a lead comes is on a case that he remembers from 20 years ago.  During the Rodney King riots in LA, a Danish photojournalist was found dead in an alley.  Bosch could not find justice for her then but now he has another chance.  Excellent police procedural!  Great read!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Very cool game to play. Looks very nice and works very well. Pretty good background images and fairly close to real.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It was simply an amazing story. Can't wait to read the next one. I loved it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Beware, if you get it, you'll be hooked forever.  I never play games, usually because I've got better things to do but this game is lots of fun.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|The thing is hard to use and the attempts I've made to cut bottles with have been total disasters. Maybe I just need more practice.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Easy and fun read! Just as good as gone girl. Definitely keeps you wondering what's around the next corner.  Highly recommended
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It's amazing to find an author who can bring dementions to characters with one mind. Each character is different but the same. I was angry and sad, hopeful and crushed. Finally the stings tied together on two poems that showcased the characters emotions and the writer's talent. Loved it!
B00821OXNY|2.0|I didn't think a show about an alien invasion could be this boring, but it is. It could have been a really great show, but Falling Skies suffers from one-note characters, bad dialog and even worse acting. Other than when the aliens are right in front of them, you never really buy that these survivors are scared for their lives. Sure, they TELL us how scared they are (over and over and over), with overwrought stories of people they've lost, and horrors they've witnessed, but the show does a bad job of SHOWING us. Everyone's hair is just a little too clean, their surroundings are a little too orderly, and there are still too many modern conveniences lingering in this \\"wasteland\\". You never feel their desperation, so you never feel any reason to care about the characters at all.<br />It's strange that in a show about alien invaders, it's the humans that are the problem. The aliens themselves are the only thing the show got right. The \\"Mechs\\" and the \\"Skitters\\" are terrifying whenever they're on screen (which is not often enough). And I applaud them for using costumes and puppetry instead of JUST relying on CGI--it really makes the aliens feel more real.<br />Unfortunately, the awesome aliens aren't enough to cover up that Falling Skies ultimately falls well short of its potential.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG I like totally addictive to this game it's so fun. U have to have skill. If u play temple run this game is a breeze. U should get of your butt and get this game.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|The last movie I reviewed (\\"Hit and Run\\") got a slam. A reader/reviewer informed me that it was a movie for the below 50+ crowd and I was obviously not part of it. What's \\"The Expendables 2\\" then? I would expect it was also created for the machismo, teen boy crowd--like, wow, man, shoot that sucka!!! Only this time--and for all movies like this--I'm in! In fact, I'm in big time!<br /><br />But then again, this old broad is the same age as the machismo dudes with the duality of muscles and wrinkled skin wrapped around them! Sylvester Stallone, that heartthrob of the '70's and '80's, is the leader of a band of misfit former soldiers, now a tightly knit band of mercenaries for extracting good guys and executing bad guys.<br /><br />Many scenes are absolutely unbelievable--in fact, so much so, that the viewer just goes along for the ride. The most blatant is the pop-up appearance of Chuck Norris in the the most incredibly isolated area. Yet, there he is eradicating the piled up forces of evil and freeing our dudes.<br /><br />The most fun part of the movie for me is the inclusion of Jason Statham as second man to Stallone. I have never seen Jason play second to anyone, but this was fun to see him in a secondary spot. Gives him new dimension.<br /><br />Someone nearly always dies in a movie like this. I was not happy with the choice, but this man's death moved the action along in a new direction and tidied up disrupted emotional energies.<br /><br />I loved this movie despite its preposterous action scenes. I loved the one-liners and the comraderie. \\"Expendables 2\\" is a most worthy escapist fare of the best kind (for those who love their action thrillers)!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's fun cause you get to win a lot on the random deal. If you need a hint it's there.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I know that other makers have less expensive flashes that have at least the same power and other features - except recycle time.  The Nikon 700 and 900 have incredible recycle times, which is important for me because I do a lot of fairly far-range flash work.  I've used others, but I always come back to Nikon for my flashes.
0756405890|5.0|No doubt about it, Patrick Rothfuss emerged a fully formed fantasy master on the literary scene, like Athena from the head of Zeus. If you are like me and have but a few precious reading hours, you might be put off by the girth of THE NAME OF THE WIND and its sequel WISE MAN'S FEAR. Don't be! I ordered the second book while only halfway through the first, and I found myself wishing that the book was longer! Rothfuss has created an entirely believable fantasy world and he sets his characters in it without any of the (sometimes lengthy) descriptions of other high fantasy greats. Kvothe seems a bit arrogant when you first meet him, but the things he has suffered and his loyalty to others make you like him despite it all. Another author whose next book I will be awaiting with great anticipation!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is my daughters favorite movie. I watched it with her a couple times and I finally ended up buying it for her for Christmas.
0307744434|3.0|Although I did enjoy THE NIGHT CIRCUS, I was disappointed by the writing. The imagery was beautiful and Morgenstern's writing is rich and imaginative...however she falls into the writing pitfall of TELLING rather than SHOWING with regards to her character development. I suppose it could be classed as a fantasy/romance, but for me, there was so much pain and emotional suffering in the book that even the semi-happy conclusion left me feeling wrung-out and sad. Nonetheless, the book contained some truly lovely escapist imagery.
B002JYPV3G|5.0|Insane. That's the word which describes this album. Nice Special Edition, full of bonustracks. But still missing 'Frail Limb Nursery', as an intro to 'Purity'...
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|A good book but alittle hard to follow not one of his best work. Still enjoyed reading it,will buy his next
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|Not their best, but still very good. Maybe they could have played more songs live (All Hope is Gone, Gematria =D). And that artwork,  man... that's impressive
B0015DROBO|5.0|It was really fun to read and I couldn't out it down.  The characters were really interesting and it was fun to see how they came together.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|This past spring my friends and I caught The Wall Live when it was in Los Angeles. It was the best concert i have ever been to. Calling it a concert does not do it justice, it was an experience. After going to the concert i bought myself and a friend a copy of the movie. We had seen it several times, but did not own it. Great movie, even better music. It came with a really cool poster and the quality is solid. I would buy this 25th Anniversary edition above all others. The case is cool, and has texture. Also then it is out of the sleeve the case can be opened up and the wall is continuous. Amazing Movie, Creative Case, and a really awesome extra with the poster. Great Purchase. My friend really digs his copy too.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|As a veteran of the 5th Marine Regiment (1/5) and the grandson of a Marine who served in the Pacific during WWII, it gives me great pride to have earned the title of Marine and to have served in the 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division.<br /><br />A must read for Marines
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I saw this movie at a buddies house and LOVED it. Monday at work i checked out Amazon and found this combo pack. $10 for a DVD and Blu-ray!!!!!! AWESOME!!!! I do not have a blu-ray player but i am pretty sure we all will someday. The item arrived quickly and in good condition. The movie is a very fun mix between reality and the comic. I have not read the comics, but my friends that have like the movie too. There is some great tongue-in-cheek moments and quality writing. If you like goofy comedies with some substance this is a movie for you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I chose three stars because, though this app makes It easier for me to check my page I didn't receive all the post to my page. Also navigating my page was a little difficult I.E. setting the page to most recent stories, checking some news feeds, ect. What you do get however Is very clear and scrolling through my page was easy as well as refreshing the page. Cannot wait till the system gets updated maybe some of these difficulties will be corrected. Over all I do recommend this app for those that have the Kindle Fire for the pictures are very clear.
6304712936|5.0|I bought this movie because it was affordable and i wanted to bump it on my new surround sound. The movie is a classic, and is a very interesting piece of historical fiction. Not a movie i can watch 5 times in a week, but great to have around for a lazy Saturday when you was a substance filled movie watching experience. The packaging is standard, and it arrived on time in good condition. Definitely a movie you can watch with your parents or your children (pending their age). Good acting, amazing music, and sounded really nice on the surround sound.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love all of Vince Flynn's books but didn't think this on was quite as good.  Just didn't put me on the edge of my chair as most of his does.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|The Amazon Basics are the best cables for their money i have ever purchased. From their HDMI cables to these, i have never had a problem I do not know how they keep the costs so low, but I appreciate it. Anyone looking for any cables check Amazon Basics before you buy anything else. In the store these were $30, and Amazon has them at roughly 1/3 the cost. Thick cables, sturdy construction. Great Value, Amazing Purchase
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was so beautiful. It had me in tears. I felt so connected to the characters. It may be the best I've read yet.
B005LAII12|4.0|Just what my husband wanted for Christmas, a couple hours of very silly adult entertainment!  He loves this movie and I enjoy it also.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|this app is cool. the pictures are beautiful and there are several different kinds. they go from easy to hard. I really enjoyed this app. cant wait for more puzzles.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver considers the predictions in several different real world examples.  He goes into enough detail to show why some work, some don't and how far the predictions can be extrapolated.  Although there is a lot of math behind these predictions, it is not a math book and could appeal to all disciplines.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I am sick of movies that you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so this was an awesome surprise!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|awesome app.  great way to find those things you need in a hurry.  or just a great way to pass the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Awesome game.  udurxut Uv hy nh ghh jjj j hjj j b b f j k c unnoticed c hbk g c j
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves this app. She had it downloaded on my phone and now has it on her Kindle Fire so the screen and graphics are bigger and better. She loves it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game except for the annoying frame that comes up first before the game starts.  Otherwise - very enjoyable.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The writing if the book kept the pages turning.  I was drawn into the life of Victoria & her relationship with herself & the ones she would have & destroy.  We all could learn a little from her.  I loved how her life was was entwined with the definitions of flowers. Somehow I could relate to her.  A great read!!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Very convenient and easy to use.  Lets you organize boards just as the computer version. Pin hog is nice too.
B000IKM8UM|5.0|One of my favorite early by Spike Lee. The script is rich and full of great dialogue. It has great direction and flavor.
1780540574|3.0|The title &#34;Official Justin Bieber&#34; Calendar caught my eye.  I did not realize that it was so tiny, not a wall calendar at all.  I was very disappointed when I opened the package.  I could have spent $10 less for a better not &#34;official&#34; calendar!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I don't know what Josh is thinking. This game is freakin awesome.<br />Is there something I don't know or something?
141659521X|5.0|Another graet one with a few extra plots, twists and turns.Looking forward to his next book to see what to Hurley.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game, lots of fun. You basically make your own little town and get to build it however you want and its really easy to get coins it's very addicting lol but it's so fun!! Plus it's from ice age!! :):):)
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Every book that she writes is better than the last. She has a fabulous turn of phrase and a highly developed since of irony. The most enable book I have read for months.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this is a pretty good app was very useful for my kindle fire!!!! I really like this app is easily for Mme to get on facebook
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This is an entertaining movie with a talented cast.  It's a surprisingly straight-forward tale, though if you think too long about the mechanics of the plot device, it doesn't always play by it's own rules.  But that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story at all.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Challenging and hard to stop playing. Like different features, strive to go further and keep trying to beat your best score.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Loved this book. Was so interesting to read about all the different customs of India. The characters were amazing! Great for anyone!
B0086700CM|2.0|Too difficult to learn how to play.  I did not like to swipe screen to make him move.  Gave up!
B0053O89WY|5.0|was still new as stated, good condition, plays perfect, arrived early, nothing but laughs for this product. nothing but compliments from me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like this type of game, you will love the one. My wife plays it all the time and she really likes it too.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I had originally got this book from the library and realized right away I would need to flip back and forth and think about not only the significance of the book, but how its structure relates to its significance. This is another pick of our book club (mine!) and I am  hoping for a lively discussion on eternal souls and philosophies of time. I must review the book (and the rather \\"separate\\" stories) again before the book club.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As captivating and page turning as the 1st book! Am going to start the 3rd now as I'm completely intrigued!!!!
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I would not have picked this book up on my own, as I am not a big fan of &#34;memoirs&#34;. However, this is one of our book club picks, so I read it. It grabbed me from the first page. First, Strayed is a great writer. Second, she had an amazing story to tell and managed to keep suspense, humor, editing, etc. all in balance. I have recommended this book to everyone I meet who either talks about going out on a hike or who knows part of the beautiful country that Ms. Strayed struggled through. A fantastic read. Get it. Read it. Enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this is a very great book, and I probably would've never heard of it if it there wasn't a movie made about it. I didn't think it was going to be good when I first started it, but as I got deeper into it I able to connect with the characters more and more. The things that went down onto those letters to his \\"friend\\" are the exact things that go through a high school kids mind everyday! I would recommend this book to any high school kid sophomore age and up.
074356619X|5.0|WOW! This is a life changing and I wish I have been introduced to this many years ago. Thank you:
B007SGM084|5.0|It has taken me about a week and a 1/2 to read ALL THREE BOOKS! Ana & Christian has to be the BEST love story I have EVER read.....my FAVORITE of any I have read!!!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a truly great book. I loved the concepts involved and Charlie is a joy to hear from.<br />However, I'm not a huge fan of the writing style, but still a good book :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an amazing book.  I would definitely recommend this book<br /><br />One of my favorite books of all time. Maybe it's just because it's the last book I read
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Kept me intrigued and read it in two days. I'm a huge fan of John Grisham and he certainly delivered a great read with this story
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|it has a great many twists throughout the story that will keep you readin until the very end all in all i give this addition 5 stars all the way
B009E3EWPI|5.0|My wife got this set for me as a Christmas present. We just finished listening to and watching the amazing performance on the DVD. We have a dedicated home theater room with the full works, including theater seats. Cranked the volume up to concert level and just let the performance soak in. It was wonderful! My closest chance to ever seeing the band in person.<br /><br />We had previously read some of the Amazon reviews, including \\"The most helpful critical review\\" titled \\"5 Star Performance, 2 Star Editing\\". I was prepared for disappointment. But after watching the DVD, I don't agree at all with the \\"critical\\" review. There is no problem with the video editing, and the \\"critical\\" review is highly subjective. We have dozens of concert DVD's. We didn't notice any difference from the typical presentation style. My recommendation -- DON'T READ THE REVIEWS! Watch this performance and ENJOY it; it is a true masterpiece.
B00280LYHS|5.0|this was a really great end to the olympiand serires it ties up all the loos ends and send the message that there is still more to come all in all an awesome read
B000YHG72E|3.0|The kids enjoyed it.  Adults not so much.  Am not a fan of Will Ferrell, but he was easier to take in this film.  Not so crude.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Was surprised at the role Meryl Streep played in this movie - not at all like others in the recent past - but nice light entertainment. Even my husband laughed a time or two.
B00005JLYW|5.0|I watched all the TV episodes of Charlie's Angels growing up.  In fact, I watched them multiple times over.  The movie adaptation with three of my favorite actresses was great.  I thought the fight sequences were cool.  I don't understand how the movie did not do better at the box office.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is my history!  I was born in 1936.  I come from a long line of newspaper publishers, editors, reporters.  I was aware of the &#34;news&#34; being the center of my grandfather, father, uncles etc. universe and so I listened, sometimes from under the dining room table, others snuggled quietly beside my dad so I wouldn't disturb him as he read aloud. I remember where I was when we heard FDR was dead. &#34;Is this the end of the world, grandpa?&#34; I asked. I have lived in Hawaii so the  Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor becomes even more vivid to me with Follett's descriptions. It's the first book I ordered on my new  Kindle because I had been anxious for part II of the trilogy.  I couldn't believe how fast the reading went ... maybe because I wasn't holding a 900 plus page book?  I didn't believe it when I came to the end ... I wanted more... what will become of  Carla and her boys , soon to be held in East Germany behind the Berlin Wall?  What about her boys?  The oriental looking one?  He is sure to have a place in history unfolding in book III. This author marvelously weaves  his characters and their offspring from one volume to the next in the trilogy. It brings true to life the heart wrenching  truth that in war NOBODY WINS!  So we must learn from history and Follett  makes it so real with people on all sides who suffer, die, and some work for a better life. Some cling to evil and selfish ways. This was a perfect book to read at Christmas with a &#34;Silent Night&#34; hymn. Carla is thinking that her father's life meant something and so would her life and the life of her sons because she would raise them to make a difference for a better world. Isn't that what we all are to do?  Read this book and you will be inspired to do your part to make a better world! History appears to be repeating itself! What can you do to prevent the same mistakes from happening all over again?  &#34;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing. Simply amazing. I would recommend this to anyone. For the ending be prepared with a box of tissues.. you will need them.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|another great game from G5!!!!!!! great graphics and storyline.  Definitly worth the cost and cant wait for the next game from this company!!
B005LAII12|1.0|To each his own, but, for me, oh my God, this movie sucked. I won't go into details as to why. I understand the point of growing up, moving on, swapping childhood for adulthood, but I thought this was truly awful. Not funny and truly boring.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book , I couldn't put this book down . Its one of the best book that I have ever read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved, loved, loved, this story.  I have read all three of Colleen Hoover's books and loved them all.  She definitely has a way<br />of writing that pulls you in and keeps you there.  Holder was to die for in this story.  The way he was portrayed was really special.  I can't wait for her next book.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|Again, I am a newbie, so I am trying a lot of different apps.  I find I like the way this integrates with Evernote and I like a lot of the features this offers in a nice orderly package.  I haven't used it a lot yet, but from what I have I would say this a must have add on for Evernote and one certainly well worth having.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Kind of a pain in the butt to pass the Kindle back and forth among players, it takes a long time to complete a game. But its good for traveling in the car or if you don't have the deck of cards handy.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|What can I say....It's Google!  This app works every time and I get exactly where I need to go in a hurry.  Some people love Google and some hate it.....pros and cons with any program.  Give this a try and see what you think.  I like it and will continue using it....
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|My granddaughter and her family took a trip to the aquarium in Savannah, Ga from their home in South Carolina and both of their children ages 20 months and 4 years enjoyed watching it.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|It's nice to be able to sit down and play a mind challenging game for 5 minutes then go on to something else.  This is just the perfect game,not too hard, not too easy.  The opening graphics are crude....but the game board is smooth and polished looking.  This could be done in much higher graphic quality.....and it might be even more fun, but for what it is.....it is good.  Get this one folks for lots of fun without feeling intimidated by bad guys or unsolvable levels.
B003UYUP58|4.0|I've been into medical-type books for a while but I have to say that the history & information in this book is one of the most accurate & comprehensive I've read! The stories of patients & doctors in this book are riveting! A must read for people in the medical-field as well as laypeople who are just interested in cancer.
B0086700CM|5.0|My girls love this game!  I love they they can play this to keep them busy and they share quite nicely to play this to.  Quiet game to play between appointments.
B000002NZO|3.0|The classic Genesis incarnation with Steve Hackett and Phil Collins was still one album away from Trespass, which places Rutherford, Gabriel and Banks with multi-guitarist Anthony Phillips and drummer John Mayhew.<br /><br />Musically, Trespass is a highly theatrical effort which borrows its substance from medieval classical influences and plays them in the fashion of a multi-instrumental 5 piece prog-rock band. Everything from the style of Anthony Phillips' pastoral 12-string guitar plucking to Banks' antique, omnipresent church organs and Gabriel's operatic singing and lyrics of bravery and philosophical mystique play out the album in such Dark Age fashion, not to mention that most of the compositions are written in scales that haven't been prevalent in music for the last 4 centuries.<br /><br />The album doesn't lack in expertise of it's subject-matter but it does lack severely in its sub-par rock department, both in performance and arrangement; the production however is non-intrusive and specially well mixed (by Nick Davis) but it does have coloring and lack of detail in the recording of the instruments, even by 1970 standards.<br /><br />If anything Trespass is primarily a footnote of a band that was yet to be on a non-rotating membership basis and one that hadn't been able to forge their own style, but it's not to be dismissed of its own quirky musical merits. Fans of the likes of Led Zeppelin & Black Sabbath should enjoy Trespass over other Genesis albums because of its similarly prominent riffs and the epic tales of adventure and glory that the lyrics display.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Here again I like games that are quickly played when you have just a short time between appointments to play something.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Since I've become a senior citizen, I am highly appreciative of movies and books with senior citizens as the lead characters. This movie is highly insightful to the problems and feelings of the aging population. An outstanding cast delivers remarkable performances.

B008VBYN80|4.0|solid game good updates real time build systems and energy recovery, just added a defense and pvp systeme, good free game s<br />can purchase to speed up production.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Gave it four stars because I thought the ending was too abrupt, otherwise I really enjoyed it.  Even though the setting was England, it reflected the society we live in here as well.  It's not a pretty picture, but a real one none the less.  More people need to read it and maybe those that are unaware will become enlightened.  Unfortunately, those that are aware and just don't care or agree with the people of \\"Pagford\\" will get nothing from it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like Mahjong but LOVED this version.  I particularly like that the tile change not only the matrix of the tile but the actual icons on each tile and there are 3 different ways to play.  If you like Mahjong ... you need to try Mahjomg Artifacts.
B001G136KS|1.0|When I received the movie and went to watch it it would not play. Come to find out it only plays on countries like Middle East and I'm in USA. I never heard of this code thing before which customer service told me was clearly marked.
B005LAII62|4.0|\\"ParaNorman\\" is a macabre-but-endearing animated children's film produced by Laika, Inc, which seems to specialize in the genre. They also produced \\"Coraline\\" (2009). Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old middle school outcast who sees, and talks to, dead people. He sees his deceased grandmother (Elaine Stritch) at home, for which his father berates him. He sees, and greets, dead people in the streets. But one day, Norman begins to see things that even he does not believe. Terrifying things. His eccentric uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) tells Norman that the 300-year-old \\"Witch's Curse\\" is real and insists that Norman is the only person who can save their New England town from being run over by zombies raised from the grave on the anniversary of the curse. So Norman feels compelled to give it a try.<br /><br />I enjoyed the macabre humor in \\"ParaNorman\\". The dead are apparently not sacred to Chris Butler, who wrote the film and co-directed it with Sam Fell. He makes fun of them, the ways they died, and the reactions of the living. That makes \\"ParaNorman\\" equally suited to adults as to children. It's just funny. For children, it takes a little inspiration from Harry Potter. Norman is a gifted boy who must solve the mystery of the Witch's Curse and save the town. In his case, he must overcome obstructionist adults, and his attempt at library research is fruitless. But the characters are all stereotypes: the indulgent understanding mother, overbearing intolerant father, self-obsessed teenaged sister, dim-witted school bully, etc. The stereotypes are plugged into the story, and they are funny. But it's as if Butler didn't take the time to write characters.

B0026772N8|4.0|I've now read it for the third time and again I could not stop once I started. The most interesting parts are his stories about travelling by motorcycle and his teaching experiences at Bozeman university. In between these stories he develops a theory about quality as something that should be left undefined and this does not inspire me much. It's true that science does not tell us how to find the laws of nature but curiosity and intelligent guesswork go a long way. In my opinion there is no need to introduce some magical concept of quality that tells us how to pick the right scientific theories. What we think is right and what's wrong is probably partly cultural, partly genetically defined and makes us who we are and how we develop new scientific theories which are then tested using the scientific method.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing page turner, as always. I can't wait for the next book from Mr.Sparks, I look forward to them always.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game to play. The story is good and the different scenes are nice. Wished it lasted a little bit longer. I enjoyed playing.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is simply amazing.<br />You can walk, swim, dive and even fly.<br />It says there are even cars and boats that you can build.<br />There are many NPCs (computer generated characters with individual names) as well as animals.<br />On my first dive, I met a manta ray and a sea turtle for instance, and my first attempt to go spelunking brought me face to face with a huge spider. Wild hogs roam the meadows and lizards bask in the sun.<br />I'm not sure a truly infinite world can be created with limited memory - at least not if the features are permanent - but for all practical purposes it IS infinite.<br />You can freely explore and take quests at your own pace - you seem to have infinite time, too.<br />The night sky is particularly impressive and reminds me of Morrowind.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that you can easily get lost.<br />I see no map and if you wander too far from a quest giver you might never find him again.<br />However, if you activate the fps counter in the misc settings, you will get your current coordinates in the lower left area.<br />The first and third figure are your horizontal position, the second one is vertical with zero being sea level.<br /><br />Here some tips - this section may be expanded as I progress:<br />- when mining, a colored glow will show you that you are close to gems/ores<br />- don't dig deeper than you can fly back up again<br />- build a house soon to be sheltered from creatures. And YES, you can build doors<br />- when distributing skill points, I recommend manna but it's up to you of course<br />- keep your pickaxe able to mine 100 blocks or more - always<br /><br />I would not compare this game to Minecraft - both have blocks but block story isn't a clone - it's a full fledged rpg adventure in its own right with the option to distribute skill points and solve quests.<br />With all these possibilities, you'll never be bored.
B003Y5H556|1.0|I got this movie with such high hopes. I was eager to see a different spin on the old Red Riding Hood tale but this movie failed to deliver. The movie was slow, unrealistic, and just flat out boring. The costumes were great and the concept behind the wolf were interesting, but the overall movie just didn't deliver. Don't waste the time or money on this one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the mystery of having to find objects within finding objects. The quests keep you going back to rooms you've already been in. Objects are never in the same place. I love playing hidden object games that have a storyline or objective to them and this one is fulfilling.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is one of those stories that back in my borders bookselling days, I would find one of my loyal customers who I knew had my taste in books, walk up to them, put Cinder in their hands, and simply say \\" READ IT\\". I would not let them leave without it in their shopping bag. Seriously, I have that much confidence in it.<br />Fairy tale re-tellings are a genre of mine that I simply cannot get enough of. Something that pulls us back to childhood memories, yet at the same time twists and turns in a compelling way that makes you think more and more about the different possibilities. Cinder screams re-telling awesomeness!<br /><br />While the description of the book may feel VERY sci fi, really it is such a wonderful blend of so much more. Slight dystopia, historical feel, fairytale -esk and Sci fi, and fantasy/magic! The fact that Marissa Meyer can weave so much into this one story and still leave me reeling and aching for more, is something that not too many authors can pull off in my opinion.<br />The characters are very easy to connect with:<br /><br />Cinder is strong willed and determined, as well as endearing when it comes to her nativity on relationships.<br /><br />Her  Droid Iko, who I could not get enough of! Seriously, A barrel of laughs!<br /><br />Prince Kai - oh prince Kai ..A literal prince charming :) You can't help but fall head over heels for him!  ( I also enjoyed the fact that it as not insta-love for Cinder and Kai, Marissa gives us a heartfelt romance that truly develops at an honest pace)<br /><br />The evil stepmother/Legal guardian - can I dump a bucket of water on her and watch her melt? - oh wait, wrong story >.&lt; She was just so cruel I kept waiting to see when Cinder would finally snap!<br /><br />The stepsisters: - One horrid, though we don't get to spend too much time with her. And one, well, not evil at all! I loved Peony, she has a kind of lust for life and just, perkiness that I couldn't help but smile at.<br /><br />Then we have The Lunar queen - the queen of manipulation, and me wanting to reach though the book and strangle her. An awesome antagonist!<br /><br />Author Tidbit- Marissa Meyer Uses much Sailor moon and Firefly in her inspiration for Cinder  , How awesome is that!<br />Have I hooked you yet? Are you drooling?<br /><br />The world created in Cinder is one that left me craving more and more. I cannot wait to see what's to come in the next books in the Lunar Chronicles : Scarlet ( book 2 ), Cress ( book 3) and Winter ( book 4 ) which will feature other fairy tale characters! Can you guess which ones?unar queen - the queen of manipulation, and me wanting to reach though the book and strangle her.

It was the first book I read after a year of reading only study books, so I can tell you that it was like a child with an ice cream that does not want it to finish with each lick.<br /><br />You can't go wrong!
B0077SGMXM|4.0|This is actually a pretty good game.  I had fun playing it on my Kindle Fire.  About the only drawback I identified was that often times the field was bigger than my screen, but that's not all that big of a problem.  You can easily get hung up on this trying to make a better score. It's entertaining and that's all I asked of it.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is a very interesting look at statistics in our world from an expert statistician, sabermetrician, and author of the famous 538Blog.<br /><br />If you want to learn about applications of statistics to things like baseball, weather, and political election forecasting, this is an excellent work.<br /><br />The book only rates 4 stars because the quality is mixed.  The chapters the author is an expert in, baseball, poker, politics, are exceptional.  The chapters on other topics are less strong.  The chapter on chess programs is mostly wrong, based on my experience with them.  So you get a mixed bag, but much more good than bad.  The author's views on why Bayesian statistics are the way to approach big data complex problems and his thoughts on global warming and the differences between the underlying science (easy) and predicting the future (very hard) are alone worth buying the book.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Very nice set of headphones. a little irritating that you have switch the sound settings around back and forth when you want to go from speakers to headphones. but the minor inconvenience doesn't deserve having a star removed.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Pros:<br />Actually has ska as a genre! W00t! That's quite a feat surprisingly. I grew sick of Pandora shoving completely dissimilar genres/artists in my playlists and Songza has the most ridiculously convoluted playlist system ever made so I decided to go back to the old Shoutcast internet radio type app. I used the KK's Shoutcast PSP radio (pspradio.co.uk) on my PSP at work all the time and this is very similar, though much more advanced and clean looking. The best part of this app is that you can adjust a 5-band equalizer, a bass boost and a virtual surround spatializer in the settings. Definitely makes music listening at work a breeze. I haven't left the 12punks.FM station for a week now! Fantastic station.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I don't know if it's $5 worth (got as the free app of the day) just to get an equalizer and a &#34;here's a top hits of the crap on the radio&#34; button; maybe $2.<br />Whoever developed the genre classification needs some help - Alternative is not a catch-all to every genre outside of rock, country, rap and pop. Seriously.

Little odd how the leading lady fell into the Bondurant camp.  Plot great until the last 1/3 of the movie where it turned predicatable and the leading protagonist predictably came to a just end.  Nice ending.

1847879071|5.0|Field's book is a clear, comprehensive, and authoritative guide to performing both elementary and advanced data analysis with SPSS. What sets this book apart from many other SPSS guides is Field's familiarity with the research literature on data analysis and statistics (e.g., the Monte Carlo studies and multi-sample simulation studies that have been used to investigate alternative approaches to performing statistical analyses). He clearly describes the statistical assumptions underlying a given procedure, identifies the assumptions that really must be satisfied to obtain correct results, and then shows how to investigate those assumptions. For many statistical procedures, he talks about the questionable practices that some researchers use, and then shows the best practices that are more likely to produce correct results. He follows a conscientious, scholarly approach in which he cites his sources--a real benefit for readers who wish to dig deeper. When I am learning a new statistical procedure, I go to Field's book first, as I have learned that he typically shows the current best-practices for performing that procedure.<br /><br />I teach statistics to undergraduates in the psychology department at a regional state university in the U.S., and I use Field's book as one of my assigned texts. Student responses to the book have generally been favorable, and the few things that they gripe about I actually see as positives. Some students think Field goes into too much detail on some statistical procedures, and they sometimes complain about the book's length (and its weight in their backpacks). But I know that a good percentage of these students will continue their studies in graduate school, and the book will continue to be useful to them when that time comes. Field shows how to perform elementary statistics, intermediate statistics, and advanced statistics. He shows how to maximize statistical power, how to compute confidence intervals, and how to compute effect size. Long after they have forgotten my lectures, my students will still have one of the most comprehensive and authoritative guides to performing data analysis with SPSS. They will be in good hands.

It maybe suffered slightly in comparison because her writing was a little uneven compared to later books. That said, her writing is generally really good, so I'm holding her to a high standard here. The main character is sympathetic and realistic and compelling. The story really drew me in and I finished the book over a weekend easily. All in all, GF is one of my new favourite authors, I'm thrilled to have discovered her and look forward to her next book!

1451695187|4.0|After having read much of the research done by Raymond Moody I was familiar with NDE (near death experiences). Alexander's experience follows the NDE pattern with a twist.  A well told story.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|It's a classic and my Dad was happy with it. His VHS tape wore out. Needed a replacement. Thank you
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Anyone who liked Phillip Phillips on Idol will love this CD.  Songs are great, both fast and slow are included.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Very addictive game, finished it on Christmas vacation in a few days.  I really hope that they will add some more maps.  I would highly recomend this game.
0765325950|1.0|I don't buy physical books anymore.  They are big, expensive and hard on the trees.  I am angry at the publisher for not launching on kindle and want to disincentivise future publishers from doing the same.  Perhaps as a matter of principle it might be time to try the pirate sites.  If it becomes unprofitable for them to play these games with customers then they will stop.  We are all more than willing to pay, just not willing to be ignored, marginalized and price gouged.
B009NQHFPU|4.0|This was a charming escape from everyday stress. His deep respect for people and animals is so beautiful and fleshing.i just loved every minute of it
0761169253|5.0|I bought this book for myself and as gifts for my creative friends. Learning how to make time for your  creative work is always a challenge and this book makes wonderful suggestions how to weave your creative processes into your daily routine. I particularly love the discussion about digital vs. analog tools and followed the author's advice on how to divide my work station. Great book.
1451648537|5.0|i really enjoyed this book, it was an excellent read and have recommended it to other people to check out
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I love this site.<br />It is very useful for the world.<br />You can find everything.<br />Always it is updated.<br />And it's free.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|Fun watch for kids!  I like that my son can change the band and have fun with the design.  Cannot find any mention in the paperwork if it's water resistant at all.  I'm hoping it is as it's a kids watch!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Good so far and stuff because we like sports and we don't care who knows..from shooting hoops to the super bowl
B0002DB0FO|5.0|EXTREMELY WELL CAST...YOU WILL LOVE THE CHARACTERS.  SEVERAL OF THE ACTORS HAVE GONE ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS. LOVED IT.
B008476HBM|5.0|I always loved this story and all the books from Jane Austen. The form that is written, the language, the descriptions are excellent.  I say that I really enjoying reading all these books.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|this is an ok game.  my kids liked it and they played it a lot.  then got bored with it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the versions in every language and the plans.The simple and easy format that is accessible to all denomination Christians.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  Great collection of movies!  Great gift for a Star Trek fan!
B0001WGIBW|4.0|I got this for our Grandson, it will work well with his present pieces, however if it had a couple more curve track it would work fine by it self as a starter set. It worked ok while visiting us and will be a great add on when he gets home.
0762445262|4.0|The mini in the parenthisis is very important as this was tiny! Was ok for the money however I did expect the light to project a bit better.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I can see this being a movie. A Great one possibly better than twilight just because  the characters have  better personalities to me. Love  this series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a must for any brony. I think this game is great and u don't need to use money if u don't need to
B00846REIS|5.0|Just as good & better than 50 shades!  Didn't want to put it down!  Can't wait to start reading the next in the ceasefire trilogy!!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I purchased this for my son who just turned six because he loves the electronic game. And it's a bit too difficult for him to put together. He doesn't really grasp the idea of points on the card. He does sit there and figure it out though.<br /><br />It's a good game and he has played with it, just I wish he was a little bit older before I bought it for him. My daughter who is 4 and also loves the electronic game won't even touch this toy because it's too difficult.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it appears to work well, but time-consuming and slow.<br />would be nice for program to summarize at end of process.<br />ie)  your battery has been checked and is functioning properly
B008O2T3O0|4.0|Leo Nucci has been around for many years and has not made too many recordings recently. I was not sure what to expect as Rigoletto is no easy opera to produce. It requires good singing as well as exceptional acting and staging. I have not seen a decent DVD that shows up well on 1080 screens and gave this a go on spec. I ejoyed it very much. No modern excesses and well played and sung. Added to that it has been dirt cheap for some time and is excellent value for money.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Best PC remote desktop app for Android tablets ever. Easy to set up and use. Extremely efficient and highly productive for a low cost app. Amazing.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very addictive. I like the progression of the game. The match three game has a lot of different tools that comes up to make it interesting. Love this game.
B00884GR0W|1.0|When you have to repeat the tutorial to try and figure out how to play the game, it is too complicated. I wasted 10 minutes trying ti figure it out and gave up. Sorry, I just don't get it. Uninstall and thankfully it was free.
B0038QMREK|5.0|While I don't have a record player, I bought this because I love the album and love the cover art. So I can't speak to the quality of the pressing, but the music is great on mp3 and the giant photo is great to have around.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|big let down, not at all what i expected. first 3 books great last 2 not as good. its sad because story line  started great
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Fantastic movie, and great to have on DVD to watch whenever you want! Thanks to careful (and clever) censorship, this movie is also fine for kids.
0670024813|5.0|This book is very insightful and accessible to those who are not practitioners of an \\"inexact science\\" aka anthropology. I actually read this over my winter break from getting my PhD in the inexact science. It's thought provoking and makes indigenous studies relatable by its comparison to Western societies. I really enjoyed Diamond's discussion of economics and the justice systems from varying cultures.
0765325950|5.0|robert jordan though you may be gone you left behind a legacy few can match. I was furious that i couldn't buy it on kindle and as there is no one here with the books in my country i had to import it from the states that cost me upwards of 130$ but....as always i think the book was all in all worth it<br />thank you for sharing your vision with us<br />you will be remembered
B0093H8H8I|5.0|No complaints.  It delivers the goods on both the processing and graphics sides.  Best value Ivy Bridge chip you can buy.
0749336072|5.0|This was needed for a high school program. The book was in great shape , no rips, cover in great shape. Thank you
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game is very nice, but I encountered a bug, where when I believe it to be autosaving (if it's not autosaving then It happens every few minutes) it crashes for no reason... I have no further details, except I'm playing this on kindle fire g1.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|You know you should be slow and sure when you order apps for your brand new Fire HD but it's the Fire HD and I guess I didn't pass attention and my inner greed to over.  It is poorly executed and makes you do too much for what should be easy.<br />sorry
B00AESN8XY|2.0|After I paid for the app, it seems like anything related to the game during play wants another 99 cents for another add-on. I thought that would get expensive so I just deleted the app completely. Seems like it would make more sense to just charge $3-$4 for the complete app and be done with it. that would be less annoying.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|The sound was amazing. This is one of the best concerts I've seen. It also includes a small documentary I didn't know about. Coldplay rocks!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|no new birdday update. being a rovio fanatic, I want every new update, and this lacks. I'm dissapointed in Amazons app service, not the game
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is super funny and has more of Greg than ever, he has to face his biggest challenge yet, ask a girl to the Valentine's dance coming up, but can he do it with Rowley in the way?
B0053O89JM|5.0|Once you watch, you are hooked.  Even had my grandson  (18) watching and diagnosing.  Great series. Sorry to see it end. Great interviews of the actors included.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This  app is great. I use it for everything from grocery lists to birthday present ideas. I actually deleted 2 other note pad apps that I didn't like, before I found this one.
B00866JL96|3.0|It's a good chick flick, if you've got an extra couple of hours and just want to chill. It would be much better if you &#34;don't&#34; read the book first.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|This app was terrible. It looks messy and disorganized. Definitely needs not to be downloaded onto any ones device. I do not recommend this.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Her journey kept me interested throughout the whole book. It was well written. I enjoyed  it. I related to many things she wrote  about her mother.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone. it is disorganized and not fast. I would tell people not to download it, and just type YouTube into their web browser.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Classic Grisham. A great read. I did not see the ending twist coming. I can't wait to read the next one.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This app is really cool. I wish you didn't have to log in through Facebook to use it, but it is pretty cool. I do wished there were more songs on there, but overall a good app.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 4 year old loves this along with Dr. Panda & Dr. Panda Daycare. This one definitely provides long lasting fun for her & we like to play with it too ;)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game! It is so fun and make s you think. it is an app for kids and adults.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves it & so do we. It's just fun and easy to navigate with little or no parental help.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Was an interesting concept of wolf man thing .a new idea of what happens when you get bitten. Nice twist .if you are a fan of werewolves you should enjoy it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|great show! Fun, twisted, keeps you guessing. Warning though, not for everyone......especially kids or people who can't handle gross/disturbing content.
0765325950|3.0|I have looked forward to finishing this series for a long time and I am happy to admit that I am finally done with it. A colleague of mine said it the best; \\"I don't think I even like the books anymore, but I have too much time invested. I need to have closure.\\" That about sums it up. For the intensely dedicated fans it is probably close to sacrilege to criticize the late Robert Jordan, but it takes a lot of blind fan devotion to ignore the fact that the books started out strong and then became 800 page (or more) testaments to digression and the development of pointless plot lines and irrelevant new characters. However, now I digress. The subject of this review is the last book. The one that was supposed to bring it all together and resolve the myriad of plot lines to a satisfying conclusion. How did I find the book? The subject nails it; tedious. The book is 908 pages long. It comprises of about 850 pages of well described disaster, tragedy and betrayal and about 58 pages of triumph. It's amazing so many things can go wrong and the light actually winning at the end (sorry if that gave away the ending). There is also an underlying feeling to the ending that Sanderson (or Jordan) felt very strongly that \\"someone had to die.\\" I thought the choice of sacrificial character was a little strange, but I am glad it is over. Did I find the book satisfying? No, not really, but I did find closure to a story I have been reading for over 20 years. Would I recommend someone who has never read the books start? The jury is still out on that.
B004YXE438|5.0|I absolutely love this app!  It allows for endless challenges with different difficulty levels on each puzzle.  Definitely my favorite puzzle app!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love it.<br />Setup took a while.<br />But it also gave me an idea how far this thing can go.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Was it the best movie ever? No, but it was a good watch for an evening home on the couch. Definitely finished watching it with a smile on my face. The boy gets the girl and a few hiccups in-between.  I liked it a lot.
0307744434|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I didn't want to put it down at all.  I like how the author takes you through time as you discover the tangled web that two magicians have created. The question for the reader is who is right and wrong in their actions during their lifetimes?
B007IK44CK|4.0|I am happy I watched this one. I wasn't sure about it at first, I mean how many of these can you really do without it being overdone? Well this one was a pleasant surprise. One of the better ones in this series. I would recommend seeing it to my friends and family.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Good book. Would have liked to have some of the stories developed a little more. L ok ed t he interview format.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I read all the books before seeing the movie. However I'm also easily able to enjoy movies regardless of their mistakes. I can appreciate what they tried to do with the movie adaptation and it's genuinely a fun ride. There are certainly things that could have been done better though. I understand the transition from book to movie often cuts a lot out, and changes scenes and characters in order to make it work in the visual format. But in this case the film really would have been improved if they stuck more closely to the book. Entire scenes happen out of sequence, and the look of cultures and characters are changed and warped to a point where they almost don't seem to fit in the universe. Some changes work, some don't. Those unfamiliar with the book won't notice, but it's a shame because the movie would have been much better had they kept more closely to the book's original plot-line. The books are nearly 100 years old, and so much of what &#34;John Carter of Mars&#34; originally did has been done a hundred times now in newer books and films. People actually accused John Carter of stealing from other movies when the source material is older than dirt. So it's sad because it isn't likely someone will take a whack at the series again.  But, if you take it for what it is. Simple sci-fi action and adventure with cool creatures and super powers. You won't care and will enjoy the film.
1558908846|5.0|Although Arnold Schwarzenegger was originally picked to be Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone made an excellent choice. There are many similarities in the storyline between this movie and his Demolition Man. This was a great action movie with lots of plot twists. I liked the variety of characters that he must interact with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app because it has so many different versions to compare verses, reading plans, highlights, and so much more.  Carry it with me on my Droid and my kindleFire.  Love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series !  It continues to get better with each episode.  Great way to walk through the history and culture of England.  Not only is Downtown Abbey directed well the actors do a brilliant job in every way.
8862931921|5.0|The feel of the cover is silky smooth with a hint of texture. This notebook/sketchbook is worth the money because what you're buying is not something that you can allow to be cheap it's something very personal that will record your creativity. The paper is a bit thin but the creamy colour of the paper makes up for it.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Because it was so very hard to put down. It was a different book than what Danielle Steel usually writes about. Yes I would recommend this book to others.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This was an entertaining way to pass a couple of hours. A little confusing at the beginning, but full of action and excitement.
B005K17RU0|4.0|ggggggggh tug Yggdrasil huh kook Cfc cfguk gfd dfr get. cry grey dye Cruz flow hybrid ghee true. glad glow glib glue
B009AY04A8|4.0|I played this on kindle fire. hidden object puzzles have zoom. overall fun game. a little too much dialog,  though.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Not as good as the first book but of course the story keeps you interested and by now the characters are well known therefore the reader wants to know what happens next and how it will all end.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|uncanny, how Clancy can write a novel and you wonder what is reality and what is fiction. My guess is it is probably mostly true!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this was made by the same devs that did Dark Arcana and Nightmares from the Deep (both are also g5 games). so if you enjoyed either of those you will like this one as well. I've been real disappointed with the last few games from g5 but with this game the quality and gameplay were back up to par with the higher rating games.  the game lenghth was longer (like the above mentioned games). played on kindle fire and didn't have any real glitches except for the inventory items not registering every time I clicked on them. there were actually quite a few items that I had to click 5-7 times to get the game to finally register that I was trying to pick an item in the inventory. other than that the game was very enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldnt put it down. Can't wait to get into book two. Can't decide how I feel about characters, happy, relieved, or sad
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This games is so awesome. It's got twist and turns. I don't care for the controls though. Other than that this is a really great game.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|I love the colors and the easy wipe off cover.  It protects the Kindle against drops and is water resistent.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really good fun game. Great story line; plus wonderful graphics. Its well worth the money; when you get a game as enjoyable as this one. Another winner G5! !!!
B000URWYTS|4.0|We used this book for my book club selection.  I found the book interesting, although there were a few slow spots.  I was surprised that the book was based on a true story.
B00004ZTDG|5.0|I have all of Clapton's catalog on vinyl and was very glad to add this one to my collection. Song selection and performance of these songs are what one would expect from Clapton and King, wonderful.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I found this book to be just as good as the first one. Left me hanging until the very end! Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00004RD54|5.0|I am not a fan of his studio work but this live set is killer. It has 2 additional songs that were not on the original vinyl recording. They are the weakest songs on this cd issue, but it is still Lou at his best.
B009JBZH54|5.0|nice trilogy by nolan, and a very nice and clear copy... a must for every batman fans, do not miss this
B00000I661|4.0|This a worth while addition to  the Metallica releases. 3 lp's, and a nice variety of songs. Every Metallica fan should own it.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed this book but perhaps those without a medical background will find some of the technical information a bit hard to follow.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I gave this as a gift, it was well received.plays excellently.Thank you very much for giving me a great gift at a very reasonable price
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent and in depth character development. Fast-paced political action that keeps you turning pages. There's so many different stories going on at the same time it's like a new book every chapter you read!
076781326X|5.0|This production was made in 1968. The time put into the stages, chorography , and costumes to take the viewer back in time in this musical.
B007NG93CK|5.0|I ordered this one mistake.  I think I have read everyone of Kathy's novels and I have never been disappointed.  I come from an investigative field myself and anyone whom purchased her novels will not their decision
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|My son absolutely loves this game but after a couple days it had him buy a decoration and in showing him how to place it in his park it won't work. Cant get out of it. Cant move on. Please fix or will have to remove app! (Otherwise would give more stars) We wish it gave the option when the game walks you through how to do something the 1st time to go out of that but it doesnt- you're forced to finish regardless.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a great novel, better than Dome.  As usual he referenced a few places and people from some of his other books.  This is a great read for teens and adults.  The ending was totally unexpected.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have fun playing this game but the only problem is that I lost all my progress and have to start over. other than that its good
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I heard that you should see the movie before you read this book, but I read it first anyways.  Fantastic story, well written, totally absorbing.  Would love to read other books by this author.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|My grandson and I selected Ice Age  Village. It apparently downloaded and could be opened but that was the end of being able to do anything. I do not hate it, what a ridiculous word. Try a tad of maturity.<br /><br />Anne Shriver
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved this sequel. Reread Bared to You before I read it. Not as many plot twists as Bared to you but has some really good ones. Only thing is that the ending isn't abrupt and doesn't keep you wanting more which I why I say the series could have ended with that book
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|The game will revert back to older stages after the game closes. I have lost multiple times many buildings and I lost a expansion. It is not fun like that!
B000002TLX|5.0|My CD arrived in good condtion and on time.  Good listening!  One of  my husband's favorite singers.  He is really enjoying the CD.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This app should have been preloaded on the Kindle Fire HD but at least this is offered as a free app after the fact.
B002ZG999U|5.0|It arrived in good condition nd very quickly. Thanks Amazon!  My  husband and I both enjoyed the DVD.  The actors all seems to have fun making this one!  Saw Expendables 2.  Planning on ordering that DVD too!
B0031R5K72|5.0|A friend had read this and, as we have similar taste in books, suggested I should read it.  Very clever story and does not disappoint.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|DVD arrived on time and in good condition.  My daughter's favorite movie star.  He sure can dance up a storm in this movie!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I enjoy the challenge of trying to get the pigs, but am not always sure how to use the different birds to best advantage.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Where have I been right?  I came across Aimee's music on Noisetrade a while back and have been hooked ever since.  There's not a lot of variety in the songs but it's a nice mellow listen.  Usually great to listen to no matter what kind of mood I'm in.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use them on my walkman every morning when I walk.  I like the clear sound, they're light weight, and the price is right.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is great.  No more fishing thru game updates!!!  Shows pics and updates.  There's no ads and I love it!!!  Faceook like in the old days!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love  it!  Best book I've read in a long time. The personal story lines and emotions of th  main characters made it difficult to put down!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|After I figured it out its ok. I'm just used to the computer version.  U must type in your search then pick the category.  Its nice once u know what o do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you get this game you will be playing on it forever! ( It's That Good!)<br />You can dodge barriers,subways,and more! It's the most awesomely game in the history of games!(I know it's that good!)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The family enjoyes playing this on the Kindle Fire HD, they are kept entertained for a while.  Great download for the kids
B00992CF6W|3.0|Truthfully, I don't know much about this game.  I accidentally purchased and downloaded this game thinking that it was similar to Minesweeper, an old favorite game of mine that I played back when I was younger.  I downloaded this game and didn't know how to play it as it didn't come with any instructions.  I even downloaded the free Minecraft Guide app which wasn't very helpful and just shows recipes for weapons and such.  I emailed Amazon and explained my situation that this game wasn't what I thought that it was.  I received a rapid email response with a full refund for the app.  I just want to say that Amazon was excellent in their response and customer service in this matter.  Thanks again Amazon!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Placed order and it arrived quickly. If you like Joe Walsh then this is the cd to add to your collection
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My 4 year old really enjoys this app. It's fun to grow and then sell your fruits/ veggies it moves fairly quickly and doesn't freeze like some other Dr. Panda apps.
141694737X|5.0|I bought this for my (just turned)two year old son and wasn't sure if it was too young for him.  It is borderline &#34;too young&#34; but he enjoys it.  Since it is a board book it is in his basket of books that he has access to at all times.  He loves to flip the pages and loves to make the animal sounds.  Very cute!  This will be one of those books I search for to add to a baby shower gift!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|How I stay organized had radically changed for the better how I take and keep track of all my notes.<br /><br />The best part is the interface. They have found a way to make the UK both intuitive and powerful with all sorts of aesthetically pleasing and useful tools.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was great!! It was really funny and I liked the picture s they were really cool too so the point is that this book was really good:)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|beautifully written wonderful story , a real pleasure to read. Me Before You by jojo moyes would definitely encourage me to look for this author again.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I can't put this thing down. The longer you play the more hooked you get! I would recommend it !
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|cant get past the second adventure.  there are no \\"help's\\" on this product, and no real tutorials.  This product leaves you hanging out in the wind, if you have never played any thing like this before there is no way for you to know what to do.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The game is fun .No problems and wish I eS a better gamer....<br />Provides entertainment for hours if toy have the time
B0090P98Z4|5.0|great game. good graphics.  fun to play could'nt put it down.  boss fights are good and dungeon layouts are interesting
B0053TMP24|4.0|The heroes of Atlantis series is as well written as the original Percy Jackson series.  This is the second book in the new batch, and was a great read.
0694007099|5.0|As an early childhood teacher, I found this Eric Carle book to truly meet the needs of small children (2-5) who may be just learning to take \\"picture walks\\" or who may simply enjoy the colorful animals depicted. This almost wordless, \\"small\\" board book offers the adult who guides the child(ren) through the story to use the title theme \\"Do You Want to Be My Friend?\\", but does not limit the interpretation by young readers. Predicting what animal is on the next page by their tails is a simple way to work through the book. Idenitfying the animals and responding with their respective sounds can make it more interactive and engaging. This does not have to be a serious book of one species rejecting another, but a book about reading concepts, animals, animal sounds, friendship, etc. Please be open-minded and allow the child to develop an inquisitive mind, before imposing one's predisposed notions about the story.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It is a true representation of the play, the costumes, acting, scenery are all fantastic.  Te soundtrack is also awesome.
0761171703|5.0|Jordan Matter has a keen eye and a unique talent for exposing the beauty we often overlook in our everyday lives. The pictures he presents in this book invoke a sense of motion and engage the viewer as a participant in the much larger context of dance that we all live everyday - when we open our eyes. Bravo!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I really liked this book, it is an easy relaxing read.  I am very excited to see how the series will progress with the addition of the new camp.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a fun, addictive game. Easy to learn and good for your brain.  The more play the more you start strategizing and figuring out ways to block your opponent.
B00030DEQE|5.0|On my computer, this card performs about 25% quicker than the card that decided to quit working at gig speed. No problems since installing, would recommend this card.
B00992CF6W|4.0|They need to update it and in creative mode not much blocks at all to use and u can't chat and in survival when u use the crafting table It tells u how to make stuff people should learn how to craft  stuff like computer
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|first time I have played!<br /><br />Very addictive!<br /><br />Would recommend to others to get this app!<br /><br />The Star Wars one is fun too!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Great!!! workout for my Kindle<br />I look forward to downloading more free exercise apps since I recently stopped my gym membership
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A timeless book that brings back vivid memories of my personal adolescent experience. No matter your background, social or economic class, or generation, all can relate to The Perks of Being A Wallflower.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Since my wife is from the Roanoke VA area, this Franklin County background carried a special connection. The area still has that flavor of an earlier time in the US when the mountain folks did their own thing. We both enjoyed this movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is ok but some of the things are too expensive.  And I think they do this for you to send your real money which I am not doing.
0307593525|5.0|It will take us years to try all of the recipes, but it reads like a novel in parts. Just great.
0385737955|5.0|I literally have chills right now after finishing this book!  This is one of the most chilling dystopians I have ever read.  I can't believe the ending!<br /><br />I spent the first half of the book not really enjoying the story much at all.  A lot of that came from the fact that the reader is kept in the dark just as much as the main character, Thomas.  Thomas only knows his first name.  That's it.  And while the rest of the boys in the Glade know a bit more, they are reluctant at telling him anything.  Apparently, he must learn everything for himself.  I found this a bit frustrating, but it did make for a very suspenseful read!<br /><br />Around the middle of the book, the action really picks up, and the boys in the Glade start to learn things.  We don't really learn what's happening until the last couple of pages, and even then we don't know everything!<br /><br />I thought the characters were amazing.  Some of them were downright crazy!  I suppose, if you're thrown in a huge maze that doesn't make any sense and you don't have a clue why you are there, it might make anyone a little crazy!  Besides Thomas, my favorite character was definitely Newt.  He was a very smart guy, who could read a lot into a situation.<br /><br />I have no idea how James Dashner came up with such a bizarre scenario, but it worked for me!  I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Love it.  Pigs as Storm Troopers-outstanding.  Game is a hoot. Han is awesome with blaster and Luke is a wiz with his lightsaber.
0545265355|5.0|Very nice product. durable and bright.  the best light i have ever purchased especially for a shop.  the color is very hard to lose
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ABOUT THIS GAME. There was a good plot and graphics . I really enjoyed the game. keep up the good work.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Movie was awesome! The blue ray also comes with a DVD copy and a bunch of special features which is good
B002WV5A9G|3.0|Take this film for what it is: an US blockbuster-style action-packed special-effectorama with good-looking actors quoting a famous series of the past. It is no worse than most spin-offs from the original series that, each in their way, could not keep up with the original one.<br />As such it works perfectly fine as many US films are known to do.<br />Neglect the usual simplistic ethics, the trite underdog plot, the intricate but so convenient time warps, the action scenes copied and pasted from countless action movies to this replica. Doing otherwise would be highly illogical.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is definitely a 5! I love the story, details are great, and it is suspenseful! :) I cant wait to see the movie but I don't see how it can compare! I laughed and cried!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I purchased and installed Olive Office Premium on my Kindle Fire HD. Test 1 was a simple text file created in the app and then transferred via usb connection to my IBM laptop. Word 2007 crashed (something I have never had happen before in years of using Word) when I tried to open the file.<br />Test 2 was to open a docx file stored in the documents folder on the Kindle, edit the file and then E-mail the document to myself. This worked fine; the file opened in Word and looked OK. 1 for 2 so far. The last test was to transfer a 1Mb docx file, via usb, from the laptop to the Kindle Documents folder. The app would not open the file - ERROR message.<br /><br />That's it for me. I needed an app that would do only the three things I tested for and it only performed well on one of them. I'm removing the app. Thank you to all those who honestly reviewed this app. Sorry I didn't listen.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book definately had some unexpected twists and turns. The first part seems pretty straight forward, then really unmasks the characters. I enjoyed that aspect of the book. The writing was enjoyable and easy to follow.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|If your not into crude comedy this will not be for you.<br />It's rated R for a reason put the kids to bed.
B00457X7XQ|2.0|Considering some of the hype this book was receiving from some quarters, I was expecting something half decent. What I got was wooden prose, cardboard characters, gratuitous sexism and a meandering plot.<br /><br />All of the women in the novel were essentially treated as sex kittens rather than strong characters in their own right, including Daryl. A whole chapter was dedicated to explaining how the law firm IT manager Sue Tabor was pleased with 'sleeping her way up' the chain of command! They're all gorgeous supermodels, and when they aren't, the author is dismissive and derogatory.<br /><br />The constant location/scene changes made it a chore to keep up with so many irrelevant characters and technical explanations. What's more, the author often felt compelled to 'pad out' the back stories for a lot of them. And I think this became the novel's main issue - pacing. It started off fairly well with a string of incidents thought to have been caused by malicious viruses being depicted, but as it got midway through the story, the author appeared to be just going through the motions and seemed like he had run out of ideas which is why we got endless 'padding' and yet more characters. Then, in the last 50 or so pages, there's a whirlwind of action only to be followed by an anticlimactic ending in which the author half-heartedly attempts to fill in gaping plot holes.<br /><br />Thrillers don't typically exude literary excellence, but even by their relatively low standards, this was a pretty run of the mill effort.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a good game just like the original, graphics are good and the control pad is the only thing kind of hard to manouver around. Other than that,  i tecomend the game.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I couldn't wait to see the next episode and I have recommended this series to all my friends!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game! It is lots of fun and keeps my attention. There is a huge variety of games to play for anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids, adults, family and freinds -- this game is providing lots of fun to everyone and they can not stop playing it
B005WYFLNU|5.0|This item looks really cute and should be fun.  However, I thought my granddaughter would be unable to play with it properly so I am saving it for her birthday.  I can let you know later (August) how she likes it.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Pac-Man is a terrific game to teach coordination. I'm still working on that, but it's an older computer game that I always enjoyed playing.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It looks good. I wish that it would display the correct time on the desktop as well as when you ultimly need it.
B0048GZWVY|5.0|it was a good movie about true life events going on right now with unmarried women having babes at young age
B000022TSY|3.0|'Easy Rider' tells of two bikers (Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper) traveling through the Southwest and South set in the 1960s. Hippies and drug use are explored, as well as the general antagonism towards 'long-hairs.' Fonda dresses in a leather jacket with an American flag on the back, while Hopper wears Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts. Fonda is appreciative of others, while Hopper is often hostile and leery of outsiders. Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L.A.<br /><br />The two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.' Jokingly riding within a small-town parade, the two are arrested and meet ACLU lawyer/local drunk Jack Nicholson who helps get them out of jail. Later the trio are beaten at night by locals; Nicholson is killed and the other two suffer minor injuries. The two then make it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and later Fonda realizes their 'freedom' isn't that rewarding.<br /><br />The movie ends when two other rednecks spot them, decide to 'scare the hell out of them' with a shotgun, and end up killing both after Hopper gives the one the finger.<br /><br />Overall, the dialogue is minimal, and the acting even worse - except for Nicholson. On the one hand, the movie was totally boring and centers around lifestyles I dislike. On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter-culture lifestyle. Regardless, Peter Fonda looks as much like a motorcyclist as I look like Mr. T.

B008BDZP3K|3.0|Here's the deal.  This was my first Zappa album.  For a while leading up to this point, I had been researching Zappa and I became really excited to buy a Zappa album.  As a fan of other bands such as Ween and Primus, one of Zappa's most appealing traits for me was his quirky and obscure sense of humor.  I had talked to many people and read many reviews to see which album would be best to get first.  Naturally, everyone said \\"Hot Rats\\".  However, one rather important detail that these reviews seemed to miss was the fact the entire album is a jazz/rock instrumental odyssey.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit disappointed.  I consider myself a music lover, spanning many genres and styles, and I have no problem with instrumentals.  However, a full avant-garde album is something else entirely, in my mind.  Although the album itself is not that bad and really showcases Zappa as a musician and composer, (I really like \\"Willy the Pimp\\" and \\"Peaches en Regalia\\"), it was definitely not what I wanted as my first Zappa album.  It lacked his humor and voice, which is really what I wanted to experience.  I give it three stars because even though I didn't like it as a whole, if fifty minutes of jamming is what you want, go for it.  However, if you are like me and are more interested in his work as a lyricist, I would definitely recommend \\"Freak Out\\", \\"We're Only In It For the Money\\", \\"Apostrophe(')\\", \\"Overnite Sensation\\", etc.

0698116496|5.0|Well, our three-year-old grandson came over yesterday and spent the night.  We were in the rocker when he told me I needed to read him a book.  I should have guessed that he would bring me GOODNIGHT, GORILLA.<br /><br />He loves to have us read him this book.  At the same time letting him tell us what is going on.  The stuffed animals in the cages.  The movement of the mouse dragging the banana.  The sheepish looks of the other animals watching the gorilla behind his back.  The fact that the zookeeper is unaware of what is going on around him.<br /><br />And he absolutely loves to repeat \\"goodnight....goodnight...goodnight...\\"  Seven times, counting as he goes.  When the wife's eyes glow in the dark on the next page we both roll back laughing.  Every Single Time We Read It.<br /><br />One the average we read it five times before I have to say, \\"Enough, lets try something else.\\"  So he'll get me GO DOGS GO or some other title.  And then, there it is again.  In his little hands with those big eyes and a wide smile.  And we start to read it once more.<br /><br />The end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought for 9 yr old Grandson. He enjoys very much.  He tried to show me how to play, but he lost me one minute into the game.

B009FZFONO|5.0|This series is very suspenseful and always surprising. The show keeps you engaged and always guessing. May not be for the feint of heart. A lot of zombies and scary situations.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider has always been my favorite game on my computer so I was thrilled to find it available for free on my Kindle Fire.  I have never played anything else until now.  Now I play with the bubbles and bridges just as often.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The game is fairly simple. Collect all eight pages without looking directly at Slenderman. This game can be really enjoyable except doesn't provide a lot of content. It takes about five minutes to finish the entire game. The only other options are to change difficulty and add fog. It obviously relies on replay vaule which isn't a bad thing but just doesn't has a lot else to do. Even though it has those downsides, it is quite scary to see Slenderman appearing everywhere with his strange tentacles. Overall, I guess this game is worth the money.
B0086700CM|2.0|My daughter and her husband play with this one.  My reaction time is too slow and so I don't last long at all.
145210655X|5.0|Both my 7 y/o boy and 5 y/o girl like it. My son loves it, he can already quote from the book. Five Stars. Amazon had fast and reasonable shipping.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I have played this several times.  My grandchildren enjoy playing this game also.  I am frustrated as I can not figure out how to learn more about the locked levels and how to go back and start all over again.  I quickly reached a level that said I need to buy and I don't understand why ?  I do see the resemblence to pool and it is fun to strategically shoot off the side to hit a color.
B008U6QANC|5.0|I'm a life long ZZ Top fan so of course I bought this.  The songs are great in a classic ZZ Top style.  The vinyl version is a real treat: double LP's on thick silent vinyl and, even better, 45rpm!  The sound quality on a high end turntable is outstanding.  Plus I got a free download of the MP3 version to load onto my smart phone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this.  It is the first application I look at each morning and evening.  Thank you for making it available and for free.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I got RED as a Christmas gift, knowing that  my favorite song was on there. I listened to the songs I knew from the radio and couldn't get enough of them. I then listened to many other songs and realized each one has a very important story. Taylor is an amazing artist and has grown to be one of my favorites. I will scream her songs when I am alone and hope they don't come on the radio when I am in public. If they do I almost have to start singing it. Each song played is stored in my mind and I will randomly start singing, when bored.<br /><br />Anyway if you enjoy a few of Taylor's songs that come on the radio, then purchase RED because you'll enjoy the other songs too!<br /><br />Hopefully my review was helpful to anyone looking to jam out with Taylor. Thank you for taking the time to read it. I hope you enjoy RED.<br /><br /> -E
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I'm a big pony fan and have been since I was a kid. I love how easy it is to play this game and how it can interact with players of different ages. The one thing that bothers me though is how long it takes to get any of the rare currency and  how crucial plot ponies are only attainable through heart gems or hours and  hours of gameplay. The more I play the more o think that the game is a big grab for money instead of aiming to please fans. Partly enthusiastic, and partly heartbroken.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Good ending to the Maze Runner trilogy.  Looking forward to reading the prequel that I got.  These books are worth the money!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always enjoyed how Stephen King interlaces story lines You will find excellent call backs for the faithful reader.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not the best game in the world but it is o.k .It gets sort of annoying after about ten min. of playing it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'd recommend this to anyone interested in imrpoving their health. I've suffered from acid reflux for years, buying pharmacy medicine, getting doctor prescribed medicine and while each worked for some time, I never got rid of the problem itself, that is, until I followed recommendations from the book and I haven't had even a hint of it in 3 weeks (when I used to have it nightly). I also suffer the book title's symtom of &#34;wheat belly&#34; (which is what caught my eye in the first place). In 3 weeks, I have shed (without dieting) over 4kgs or over 9lbs (my start weight was around 90kgs or 198lbs/14st 2lbs). Again, I have tried and failed to lose weight for years, starting to gain more and more. I haven't done a waistline measure but the belts and the work trousers definitely tell me I'm losing inches around the waistline.<br /><br />If this book had lectured me what to do, I would never have read it. The author, as well as being well researched, knows he's telling the reader something they'd rather not hear (stop eating wheat based food). I'm a bread addict (and now I know why). Wheat based food items were what I craved (bread, pizza, pasta, pancakes, scones. muffins etc etc) but Dr. Davis expalined to me how this has come about, mapped against significant research and led me to take the decision for myself to switch my eating habits and for that I been rewarded with essentially instant gratification through weight/waistline loss and no acid reflux.<br /><br />All of the book was good reading, some of the more medical information I skimmed over at first reading but having got to the end I will go back and read this thoroughly. However, I didn't need to understand the deatil of that to gat the value of the message.<br /><br />The author told it like it is and despite my scepticism about some things, by my own example in a very short time, I can now say he was right. One example -<br /><br />I live in the country and there are no pizzerias nearby. Pizza to me is &#34;heaven sent&#34; food and when it was around, it wasn't for long. There's a pizzeria in a town about 40kms away I've been keen to go back toit  having not been there for years. By chance, a group of us went to it after the movies just the other night (about 3 weeks into my changed eating habits). To think that I could sit in a pizzeria watching others scoff it down and be completely indifferent while I enjoyed my chasen salad defies belief, but that's how it was and that's just how Dr. Davis said it would be - amazing<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Davis4;heaven sent&#34; food and when it was around, it wasn't for long.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works with my laptop LAN the pointer is a little hinkey but you can choose between track pad or touch screen and even select left handed functions. I do not like track pads in general so I stick with the touch screen UI. Run hdmi cable to large display and your desktop is on without having to drag it out.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great story. The character was well developed through the story. Made you fell you where right there with him. I`d give five stars to this one.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|The effects are amazing, the actors are great, and it even stars two of my favorite super heroes (Iron Man,Captain America). Though there's one major flaw in the story besides it being poorly written. The Hulk is invincible..... I don't know much about Hulk in the comics, but this pretty much makes the Avengers pointless. In the movie it overly depicts Hulk as invincible, everyone is afraid of him, he gets shot with hundreds of lasers and nothing happens, at the end he utterly destroys the bad guy without help from any of the others. Seriously? Everyone else is just there to look cool while the Hulk dominates everything. Lame. This movie should be called Hulk 3. Glad we rent instead of bought.....

B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a cult piece and I found it shocking at first then entertaining because it was so over the top!  Of course I recommend it because everyone else has read it and you really need to know what all the fuss is about!
0545265355|5.0|I just couldn't wait for the movies! It has been a long time since i'd read a Trilogy book set in 3 weeks. I couldn't put it down. Susan Collins has become an author on my list that i keep an eye out for now. She writes to the point that keeps you turning each and every page and you even read a little of the next chapter, and then realize darn i have to take a break, and get my stuff done. My Husband Called me a Book Work because he never seen me for three weeks without one of the books in my hand!!!!  BRAVO!!!!! Susan Collins

B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is better than the first; still a knock off of Fifty Shades but it's somewhat entertaining.  Eva's roommate, Cary is very funny and kept the book going with his quirky antics.  Definitely want to read the third one.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|What does \\"intimate\\" sound like? This. What does \\"great reverb\\" sound like? This. What do people mean today that today's records do not have \\"dynamic range\\"? This album will teach you. It's unbelievable how great this album sounds. Go ahead - record yourself playing guitar and add your plugin-based reverb to your track. Listen back to it - sounds good, right? Then play this as a reference. That plugin doesn't sound so good, eh? hehe - yep.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This series will open your mind as well as your heart. It is a very well done mixture of fantasy, legend and so called reality. What is the difference anyway? You'll ask yourself the same question...
0553805371|5.0|This is great.  I studied Physics in college before Quantum Mechanics was even in the textbooks.  With this lucid explanation of what is going on in the mind of the theorists, it becomes more clear the role of mathematical modeling behind the Physics.  It seems to me that the necessary modeling to prove the Theory of Everything proves too much.  I quit where the description of the extremely low probabilities of things being the way they are is just chance because there are so many universes.  It is easier for me to have faith in God than to take that leap of faith.  But I could never be a theoretical physicist.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|I just loved this CD her voice is absolutely wonderful something you can listen to. Over and over again. Love it !!
B008RZF1UO|5.0|This really is an amazing album. I have to admit that I do miss Roy Khan as the lead singer but Tommy Karevik does brings an amazing feel to Kamelot while still bringing a similar energy as Khan did. This CD has a great story and the music does well to convey it with the emotions connected to it. With the exception of a couple badly placed childrens choir parts, the songs really are amazing. Also very great live. I was also fortunate to meet Tommy and the rest of the band, wonderful/nice people!

B004J88SGC|5.0|if you love billy joel get this dvd if you love concerts this one will become one of your favorites . he doe so many of his hits and there are guests that join him on stage .
B000IOM1YG|3.0|The CD is filled with some great music however, about half of the songs are earlier versions of the finished songs on the 1st half of the CD.  Didn't really care for them, but the first half if nice.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|joes first cd in a while and it hits all the marks . songs are really good to listen to and the dvd is a great extra
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|My other free games allow you to earn free money (peanuts) the longer you play. Maybe you should upgrade to that level. The game is fun and addictive.
B006P0FD4W|4.0|These movies are a must have for the die hard Paranormal Activity fan but it certainly is nothing like the 1st one.  Same old, same old but there are a few jumpy moments.  They should have stopped after the 2nd one, but it's not the worst 3rd ever!
B000ENC6XM|5.0|This HD DVD does not work on any other type of dvd player that an HD DVD PLAYER. I can't wait to see the whole movie for a change, I've seen most of it at different times and have always wanted to see the complete movie, it just arrived and I can finally watch it, from what I've seen and heard I'm missing out so I gotta go now to put it in the player. Thanks Much. :)<br />I ordered it.....I got it.....I like Constantine and UStrade got it to me, happy camper.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This radio app has a very nice design and is easy to use. Has several more features than that other radio program that I heart! Lol
B002SAUCBC|5.0|A book like this should be on every kindle! I couldn't take my eyes off the pages. Definatly 5 stars.
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|I'm sorry I rented this movie, if you can call it that. I've rented or watched films by this director a number of times and have found them to be weird/bizarre/stupid/pointless and poorly scripted and/or acted. Never again will I waste my time on such a movie.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|This book really makes you think about the nature of our lives and our deaths; very thought provoking in an existential way.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this zombie show, but it has pulled me in and hooked me. This is just a great drama (like Lost) and just happens to have something sci-fi happening. Really great stories and amazing characters.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I read the book - which was slow and not worth buying.  (borrow it from the library if you want to read it)  The movie is more interesting than the book.  it had a few things in there that didn't seem to match up with what the book said... I guess it's hollywood trying to make things interesting that are lacking in interest.<br /><br />My sister has schizophrenia so this is why I bought the book and movie to get a better idea of what she is dealing with.  If it wasn't for her, i probably wouldn't not have finished the book - it was just too boring... but the movie is something I could see watching again if it was on TV.  I probably wouldn't buy it though... It's a waste of money.  Not worth watching over and over and over gain so no need to buy it for your collection.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I`'ve played Mahjong for a while and really enjoy it, but this particular one has me hooked good!t' s so easy to see and has great combinations. The tiles are even larger and easier to play with. I often run my Kindle down before I'm ready to give it up. If you like Mahjong you' 're going to love this one.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|AMAZING!!!!! I loved the book like I said it was amazing. It could not have been any better it was perfect
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This was listed as a comedy, but we didn't see many opportunities to laugh.  The characters did a reasonable job playing their parts, but the story-line was tenser than expected, and graphic.
B00A2H9L2E|1.0|Now, before I even go off on my rant, just know that I'm not a fanboy of the Silent Hill video games. I actually liked the first movie, but this one was just so poorly done it was embarrassing. I felt like I was watching an episode of Goosebumps or Are You Afraid of the Dark after a while. The plot and story were both clearly underdeveloped, as well as the main and supporting characters. After paying extra to see this movie in 3D, it was really hard not to walk up to the front desk and ask to get my money back. Just, awful.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|she loved it best gift i got her easy to keep track of disks and portable also its a pretty pink
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|this is the first gaming mouse i have ever owned. i play fps games and it is amazing. i love the different dpi settings. one of the best things about the look is the logo. you can change it to any color you could want. the macro is cool also. i recomend this mouse to any gamer!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Well, everything the doctor went through he couldn't describe in words, but he tried anyway.  This was so many times I gave up reading it and read NYPD Red by J. Patterson and haven't opened Proof of Heaven since, over a month ago.  At least he tried.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I like to watch every version of Emma that I can.  It is one of my favorites.  They did a great job with the actors they chose to play the different parts.
B009LRE040|5.0|What is there to say??? Batman is the greatest superhero of all time and this movie depicts his awesomeness very well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Nice app for a variety of games. Only drawback I found was that the directions weren't clear on some of the games. Also, you have to beat games to unlock others. Other than that, an A+ app. I recommend.
B000P0J024|5.0|This CD/DVD is fantastic! The best part of the DVD is seeing how they worked together to craft songs and learning the &#34;happy accident&#34; of how this group came together in the first place.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|When my best friend recommended this book i was hesitant at first, but after the first chapter I was hooked. This book is wonderfully written. I absolutely couldn't put it down!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The match was perfect. The color black was a good choice for me. Looks like a daily note book. The kindle sets up nice for hands free reading or viewing videos. It took a week to get it . But it was the holidays<br />I would gladly buy more of there products .
B00846REIS|4.0|Was looking for something like fifty shades.... This is in no way just as good but it definitely works. It was fun to read!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|skip the sex, skip the romance, skip the people who can't breath.  Yes, the romance is cute in a high school kinda way.  The sex is great, in a \\"non-high school\\" kinda way.<br /><br />But as the mother of a teenager, who after 5 years of being home schooled, decided to enter public school this year ... the actions, thoughts, feelings of a teenager who has been outside of the typical high school crap is so accurate, so funny and so comforting.  It really is a perspective of being on the outside looking in.<br /><br />Our home schooled children often have a higher level of maturity.  Probably because they are around adults more then children during schooling.  But Sky's reaction to her first day is so very similar to what my DD went through that it was funny.  And helped her see that it is okay to be a little different.<br /><br />Good book.  Not great for an adult as it is based on a 17 year old and probably a little too mature sexually for most 17 year olds (still not sure if she will read it), but overall, great comedy.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book. Once I got in too the third chapter I was hooked and couldn't put it down.
B003L77GHE|5.0|This show is so awesome and is such a great portrayal of vampires and humans trying to coexist. The acting, effects, writing, and everything else are perfect! I cannot recommend this show enough
1938469011|5.0|This book series has been long over due. I have so far enjoyed every book within the brewing elements series and this one being written by Stan Hieronymus is a must in any brewers library; be it a homebrewer or professional. Stan gives the most comprehensive account of the aspects of hops and current scientific studies on hops. This book is truly a gem for anyone wanting to improve there brewing through better hop utilization.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. Think Apollo 11, modern day, with way more humor. Can't<br />beat the price. Great book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm not a fan of the horror genre because I find the storylines tedious and ridiculous. However, this mini-series presents layers of depth you would not find in your average horror film that goes for &#34;jump-in-your-seat&#34; factor. The show is creepy, salacious, insidious and utterly skin-crawling, in a GOOD way. Kudos to the writers and actors because the script and acting are top-notch. Jessica Lange is a force to be reckoned with.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great show.  Robert Downey Jr made this movie work.  I love his interactions with the Hulk and Thor.  Great stuff.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|this book was hard to put down! David made me laugh out loud or shutter is disgust, read it you won't be sorry
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Tried three times to load. It would not run on my new Galaxy Tab. It's too large and it doesn't work.
0792839749|5.0|The Kids and adults love this movie. It is a good family treat. Good for all ages. Fun songs and good plot.
B007R3BB7Y|4.0|Very good stuff, but like many others I prefer Bill's trio recordings with LaFaro/Motion (or his last trio with Johnson/LaBarbera).
B00006RJ59|4.0|This movie has a lot of good action in it. Dolph shows his action techniques in this good movie. Try it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game. Time goes by fast. If your stressed out ...Buy this Game!! You won't be disappointed. Have fun!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am a late arrival to the fan club for Downton Abbey...don't know what I was doing while this exceptional series was playing for two seasons, but I will clear my schedule now for season 3.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this book so I could read it before the movie came out. I  enjoyed both, but I've always liked books better.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Colorful, vivid, and imaginative; this is a valuable classic and the world is a better place because it is available for free!
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Thid is a great tool for creating documents on my Kindle Fire and then intergrating them with Windows software on my PC.
B004478GNI|5.0|It's a lego's product, and you can't beat that. So many to pick from that it's difficult to rate them individually.
B003LXSY60|5.0|I couldn't wait to listen to this album when I first got it. I wanted to hear those gritty, rough, and catchy guitar riffs, but to my surprise there weren't any that jumped out right away. I wanted to hear something like &#34;I got mine,&#34; but it wasn't there. I felt let down. Surely I had missed something, so I listened again. There still wasn't that one heavy guitar sound that I wanted to blast from my car. While I was looking for more of the same, the Black Keys gave me something different that I didn't appreciate at first. I have since listened to this album many more times, and it keeps getting better. I'm willing to go out on a limb and say that this is my favorite Black Keys album to date.
6304907648|4.0|I love this movie! The acting is top notch, from Sigourney Weaver to Harry Connick Jr. Some of the smaller parts are played by people that we see quite a bit, but don't really get their star at the front of a movie. They're great, nontheless. Buy it and I think you'll agree that it's a fine movie, good story, and very good acting.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|good movie for the family, cute, done well, good story theme, would recommend it to anyone, not too much mean things going on
B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|I really enjoy Bruce Willis, and watch all his movies. This one I didn't like. The story matter just didn't appeal, although Mr. Willis does his usual to make the film fly. I just can't get myself to recommend it to anyone, unless you get it for free.
B002UM5BXW|1.0|I think it's silly and bothersome to have to review a book after reading it here.  I'm not a critic.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|I can't always put my finger on why I like some movies, and that's ok. Every movie doesn't have to be analyzed. I just liked this movie, and watch it from time to time. Recommend it.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|this'll be short and sweet. i'd list the special features if another reviewer hasnt already. but there are plenty of featurettes ranging between 23min to 27min long. this is what i love about blu-rays, the amount of special features you can get. though, its sad when most companies just dont want to give you what a standard bluray should have in special features. but this casino royale is packed with great featurettes as well as 4 deleted scenes.<br />the music video to the opening theme to this movie is also included, which isnt all that but its nice that they added it for those who want it. what i didnt see was the trailer for said movie. this is another thing i see happen a lot with the majority of the movies out there. they dont include the trailers. i mean, what a great opportunity to do it, but they don't. its strange. i dont know about you guys, but i love the trailers to movies i enjoy. and i only buy movies that i enjoy. a series like harry potter gets its trailers, but another series like resident evil retribution doesnt always get their trailers on their releases which is annoying. but its only a minor gripe.<br />if you enjoyed this movie, you'll be happy with the extras. i know i was. so go on and buy it! oh just in case, it comes in spanish and french audio.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game makes you feel like you're on a high speed chase. play with some good music in your ears and you're all set!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This movie is classic Burton through and through. It has a Edward Scissorhands feel to it. The score is done by Danny Elfman, who I personally think is absolutely fantastic, and always does a wonderful job on Burtons films.<br /><br />The 3D was really kind if disappointing. The depth was o.k. and there were maybe one or two pop outs at the most. There is a preview for the new OZ movie, and the 3D on that movie looks spectacular.<br /><br />The story itself was really great. I really enjoyed the B&W, it added a wonderful feel to the movie. The one thing that was kind of a bummer for me is the character design. I am not big on the thin body, big head design, like in Corpse Bride, and Victor looks almost exactly like Johnny Depps character in Corpse Bride. I wish Burton would of been a little more creative there, but nonetheless this movie was great, and screams old school Burton.<br /><br />Overall this is a must see movie for any Burton fan, or fans of the original Frankenweenie short. I don't think its worth bothering for the 3D, unless you are a avid collector of 3D movies.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stories about &#34;time-travel&#34; have been written much longer than many people suspect; have you read Twain's &#34;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&#34;? But King gives the genre a couple of fresh twists: entry to the past can only occur at one specific point in the timeline, and each recurring &#34;trip into the past&#34; negates anything done in previous &#34;trips&#34;; it is always a full &#34;reset&#34;.<br /><br />Being &#34;A Constant Reader&#34; of King's books since the beginning, I probably am a bit biased in my opinions. My top three favorites (as of this writing) would probably be The Stand, the entire 7-book epic The Dark Tower and... believe it or not - It. If allowed to expand to a Top Ten list, it would have to include Under the Dome, The Dead Zone, Christine, Desperation/The Regulators, Lisey's Story, The Talisman/Black House, Needful Things, Insomnia... oops - that's more than ten, isn't it? The only two King books I refuse to re-read (although they were well-written) is Pet Semetary and The Tommyknockers, and it would take too long to explain why... besides, it isn't relevant to this review.<br /><br />I always TRY to approach an unread Stephen King book with no expectations; no preconceived notions: just sit back and let a Master Storyteller do his stuff. That was not as easy to do with this book. Having, as its basis, a pivotal event in world history, it was difficult to imagine how King would choose to drive this vehicle. How would he deal with things like paradoxes (what if you went back in time and killed your own grandfather?) or parallel worlds (quantum theory)? I thought he took a unique approach to those (and other) aspects of time-travel, although some have said he took &#34;the easy way out&#34;. There will always be detractors, but - thankfully - King pays them little attention.<br /><br />I don't want to make this a long, drawn-out synopsis of the book; no &#34;spoilers&#34; and no Cliff Notes, just my opinion (for whatever it may be worth). Whether you consider yourself a &#34;fan&#34; of King's work or not, you will (probably) either really enjoy this story... or you won't. I suspect there will be few who finish it with the feeling that it was &#34; just OK&#34;.<br /><br />In conclusion, all I can do is recommend it - highly - to anyone who appreciates a well-told tale.ever it may be worth).

B0035YDM9E|5.0|I am impressed with the base of knowledge and understanding Joseph Stiglitz brings to economic issues. The bank bailouts of 2007-08 were a disaster for America—this book tells us why they happened and what the fallout of such an enormous new debt package means for us all. I just finished the author's recent book, The Price of Inequality, and I think it is a must-read, too. Readable, frightening and very important for understanding the growing trend of economic inequality in this country and what it means to each of us. We need to know what goes on behind the scenes in American politics, banking and the financial sector. Five stars!

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I downloaded rental so that I could watch on an airplane while traveling.  It worked before take off then while in the air it showed &#34;Download error&#34;.  Needless to say, never was able to watch, since it needed to be viewed in 48 hours.

B0091WMSNU|5.0|This is exactly what this genre of film should be. The pacing is incredibly tight - there are no wasted scenes. The all-star cast works together in a way that NBA coach Phil Jackson would be proud of. Every scene is a give-and-take where ego is set aside in favor of making the best film possible. The intercutting between story lines emphasize character arcs where we see protagonists become pathetic, nobility found where we should have expected but didn't, and retribution for body counts that won't quite feel like it counts for much.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book draws you in right away. I could not quit reading it.. I had to make myself. This  is a great love story. When u start this book u will not want to put it down untill it is done. Love this book.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I recently watched the re-showing of this on BBC America and was appauled at how much had been removed to make it fit the 1 hour time slot. The show is 1hr and 12 minutes but BBCA had cut it down to around 50 minutes to allow for commercials!<br />I had DVR'd it to show to the kids but it no longer had any heart. They had removed much of the back-story on several of the characters and completely removed the ending turning it into simply another, mindless action show.<br /><br />Lesson learned - if you want to re-watch an old BBC show don't wast your time on a re-broadcast. Download from Amazon and get the whole program.<br /><br />Added bonus - the downloaded version (from Amazon to my Tivo) was of a vastly better picture quality than the BBCA broadcast of the same show.
B000089RV6|5.0|What else can be said about this classic that hasn't already been said. I just wanted to add another 5 star rating to this king of hard rock albums. I have followed this band for over 30 years and all their albums are good but this as well as Highway to Hell and Let there be Rock are the greatest!
B001NHNG64|2.0|This is the second Reacher novel that I've read.  I started with the first, \\"Killing Floor\\" which I liked despite some logic issues.<br /><br />So here we have the second Reacher novel, and once again, Jack is in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In this case, he's strolling down the sidewalk near a dry cleaners and as he's walking by, he sees a nice looking woman with an injured leg walking out of the cleaners.  She drops her cane and Reacher, being the gentleman, helps her pick it up.  As he does so, suddenly he and the girl are surrounded by armed thugs, shoved into a car, and ultimately driven across country in the back of a van to the mountains into a militia compound.  You later learn that the girl is an FBI agent, daughter of the head of the Joint Chiefs, and the president's goddaughter.  Reacher just happened to be taken along with her, and little did the bad guys know, this was a huge mistake on their part.  It escalates from there.  Anything involving Reacher involves gunshots and snapped necks.<br /><br />Some things I've noticed(that others have mentioned):<br /><br />1.  Why. . .why. . .why, do all the characters in the books end most of their statements with \\"Right?\\"  Like, \\"That's the plan, right?\\"  \\"We have two options, right?\\"  Every character minor or major talks this way and it ultimately begins to stand out.  It becomes glaringly noticeable to the point that it bothers you.<br /><br />2. Nods and shrugs. I guess Lee Child feels that you can convey endless messages just by nodding and shrugging.<br /><br />3. He overwrites.  Lee, we don't need a whole page describing one thing or one thought or how a lock mechanism works.  Really.<br /><br />As the title states, this book could have been shorter but it seemed like Child just didn't know how to put it to bed, or maybe he just didn't want to. Either way, I got to around 65% and I was thinking, \\"Ok, time to start winding down now,\\" but no, it just kept going and going.  Just when you thought things were going to go off a cliff and hurtle to a conclusion, he'd pull back. It began to border on tedium.  Since I was already so far in, I decided to finish it.  May as well, right?<br /><br />Since this is only my second book and there's like fifteen or so more of these books, I'll hold off judging the whole series.  As of now, I sorta like them, but far from love them.<br /><br />Oh, and I don't care what anyone says, David Baldacci's new John Puller character whether he's a Reacher ripoff or not(yes, there are similarities, but Puller has more personality), is awesome.were going to go off a cliff and hurtle to a conclusion, he'd pull back.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Nice to have a CD finally.  Very creative and engaging work by these guys.  I hunger for their next endeavor.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is a lovely quick read. The characters may seem one dimensional, but I personally believe that is because the author really understands mental illness. I am a psych nurse and found this book to be enjoyable partially because I rarely get to glimpse that side...and often wonder why patients with mental illness behave the way they do. The Silver Linings Playbook isn't life-changing, but is life-affirming. It isn't great literature, but it is good entertainment. I initially chose it because of the subject matter and trailers for the movie, but now when I watch the trailers I am a little apprehensive about what might happen to these characters. Also, I was under the assumption that Sandra Bullock was cast as Tiffany, and now that I see it is Jennifer Lawrence, I am way happier because Sandra Bullock is gross.

B009VB7P6G|5.0|It was fantastic! We loved this more than the previous Tinkerbell movies. It has such a good message too. I recommend it.
B003PAXOPU|5.0|My nephew is a collector.  He loved the &#34;extras&#34;.  He really liked the books and cards.  He said that it was one of his favorite collector's editions.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Best Bond movie so far and he bleeds too. He is not your everyday pretty boy James Bond, but a real tough SOB!
B00A77II0U|4.0|creepy and dark but very entertaining. Lot's of fun. Easy to follow story and I didn't have to use the hint button constantly to figure out what/where to go next.
B00A6SMN8I|5.0|Like many other Monster High Collectors, I was excited about this new Create-A-Monster set and couldn't wait for it to be released.  I think a Blob girl is an especially clever addition - the Blob is a classic movie monster that could have easily been overlooked.<br /><br />Blob Girl<br />The head and body of Blob girl is translucent dark pink with silver micro glitter mixed and encased in the body parts.  She comes with a hard plastic wig that easily slips onto her head but fits quite snuggly.  The wig is a slightly darker pink than her body and is styled to look like a chin length flip that is melting from the top.  The only real blobby part of her besides her coloring and wig is her forearms that have some small globules on them.  The Blob girl has bright orange eyes and she is wearing pink and blue eye shadow and cherry red lipstick.  She is wearing a cute short sleeved mini dress that is light blue with a hot pink blob pattern.  Her high heeled shoes are great - they are hot pink and continue the melting blob motif.  The Blob girl is my favorite of the two dolls.<br /><br />Ice Girl<br />First I will mention something about the Ice Girl that some collectors might find troublesome.  Her torso, upper arms and thighs are completely transparent blue and show all of the manufacturing mechanics - while her lower legs, forearms and hands are a different shade of translucent blue.  Her head is yet a slightly different shade of blue and is opaque.<br /><br />The body parts of the Ice girl are sculpted to be slightly angled and blocky to appear crystalline.  This doll comes with a light blue wig with pink highlights.  The wigs for the newest CAMs are a vast improvement over the previous kits.  This wig is silky and none of the plastic under structure shows.  The Ice Girl is wearing very light frosty pink lipstick and pink and lavender eye shadow.  She has purple eyes and blue eyebrows.  Her high necked sleeveless dress is mostly black with a pink icicle and snowflake pattern.<br /><br />Additional<br />The only real complaint I have as far as quality of these dolls is that the elbows on both were extremely stiff, so much that I was very afraid that I might break the joints.  My advice is to look on the forearms and see that on one side of the joint there is a small plastic tab and the other side of the joint will be rounded.  Bend toward the rounded side away from the tab to loosen the joint.  Once I did this the arms loosened up and can now be posed.<br /><br />If you are looking for some new fun dolls to play with, put together or use as background characters then these are your girls.  This starter pack comes with the parts to make two complete dolls,  one doll stand and one pair of shoes.  Both dolls have interchangeable parts (hands, arms, legs, heads, clothing, wigs) and can be used with other Create-A-Monster Starter Packs and Add-On Packs.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this at a retail store for $24.99.tern.<br /><br />Additional<br />The only real complaint I have as far as quality of these dolls is that the elbows on both were extremely stiff, so much that I was very afraid that I might break the joints.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|You can use this to transfer a digital audio signal via USB from your iPad to a DAC of your choosing. I use mine to get pure digital audio from my iPad to the DAC in my Fiio E-7, skipping the rather skimpy op amp in the iPad altogether. From the E-7 the sound goes to the line out of the E-9 and on to my home receiver. Cheap but good. Better than using the amp in the iPad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing from the first page to the last.  It was recommended to me by a friend and I read it in an afternoon - couldn't put it down!  Do yourself a favor and read it!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|We sent this to our son and his family in San Diego  who have now viewed it and reported back to us that they thought it was an excellent film and they all really enjoyed it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|GREAT SERIES, I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AGENT PENDERGAST SERIES. CAN NEVER WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|A good gift for preteens and up. It's made of plastic so it may not last long for a young child that isn't so careful with toys. But functionally, it does what it says. Love the sound effects.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have a hole lot of dragons my storm id number is 291226 .I also like it when u get new dragons
1552091090|5.0|Great little book to read to you children & grandchildren.  I bought one for each of my 4 grown sons as a gift.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I have played this game a long time went through all the glitches and still played now the worst glich has happened I get on my kindle fire and the game has started me over to level one I was level 81 with over 3.1 million coins and 27$ I have put so many hours into this game I loved this game now everything is gone this sucks real bad : (
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|lots of action, simple plot, mildly entertaining, but not recommended if you are counting on a crowd pleaser for the evening
B000N6U0DS|5.0|Great movie rate for kids 8-10 yrs.old & families.. I give it a thumbs up.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great writer and one of the best observation of human social interaction and capturing the associated emotions.of social interaction. Also, one of the most romantic stories I have ever read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kid thinks this game is the new Legos or something. He just keeps creating and destroying an doing it all over again. I was reluctant at first because the price seemed high but he made the honor roll so why not? He loves it and that makes me happy he's having fun.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was not my usual choice but I had to see what all the hype was about. It was an exciting story but not for me to purchase the follow ups.
B001HN6918|5.0|Thought the 2nd Panda would be a flop and found it hilarious!!  If you've never seen Panda I, then buy them both.
B007885IJU|5.0|Quick delivery and perfect condition!<br />This group is amazing and this album is timeless. I am glad that I purchased here since it was more expensive in stores. If you are a vinyl collector, be sure to add this to your collection.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This guy can really write a book.  He really went into detail about the work. A must read. Could not put it down.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|Fast delivery and perfect condition! Plus, this album is awesome!! I listen to it almost every day. If you are thinking of buying it, just go ahead and do it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|it was a good book but just did not think it was the normal great book that usely comes from Grisham
B009FZFONO|3.0|Series kinda crapped out on me after they lost the overarching plot of trying to get to a safe haven. Now, its more about the interpersonal relationships (since Season 2). C'est la vie. Good zombie kills, though.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|The plot was very good.  Development of the characters was well done, particularly the main character, John Rebus. Compulsive reading.
B005RUV0NY|2.0|They are following the comics I've learned, but I wish they would have gone with the overarching plot of trying to find safe haven.  Good zombie kills, though.
B008S4FZHI|3.0|I sometimes think Patricia Cornwell gets too bogged down in technical detail.  I found this to be the case with this book.  I felt the ending was weak, as if she decided to finish it in a hurry.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely love this book!!  I can't get enough of Abby & Travis! Their story is captivating & wonderful & a must read!!!  Totally can not wait for Walking Disaster to come out!  :D
B0066WJLU6|3.0|This app keeps telling me that another app is using my camera so the led part won' t work. There are no other apps running. The other part works, it just lights up the screen very brightly.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Like: Bane was a brut.<br /><br />Not Like: He beat up Batman.<br /><br />Like: Cat woman.<br /><br />Not like: Limited role. No finese.<br /><br />Like: Commisioner is back<br /><br />Not like: thought he got popped in 2.<br /><br />Like: lots of action.<br /><br />Not Like: too much shooting.<br /><br />This is a like-don't like Batman sequel.<br /><br />I'm guessing this is it for Christian Bale.<br /><br />Heck, I thought Clooney was a great Batman.... I miss the jokes. We need a Batman who can make me laugh.
B002PLALCO|5.0|and her music. Didn't hurt much either when I finally found this at a good price on amazon. Wished she would bring back &quot;Oh my god&quot; again to one of her tours.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The person I gave it to was very pleased with the condition and was happy to get it. I ordered late and I was surprised that I received it in time.  Five star.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|This is a great microphone.  It fits easily into all the recording equipment I'm using.  It has some heft to it so I know it's not going to fall apart and be some wimpy microphone.  It gives me great sounds.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Husband loved it! I was glad to find it as a gift box set for him, it made it even better!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The book takes a while to get going.  I almost put it down.  Glad I didn't!  What an amazing journey.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Amazing! Another fantastic heart-shredder from Jodi Luckily. Although religious bigotry does not feature on my best seller list I was hooked and could empathise with the characters . Definitely a must read for fans of Jodi.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After seeing the show on Broadway, I decided to give myself the soundtrack as a gift. This recording didn't disappoint in any way.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Simply amazing! So much better than the Nicholas Sparks romance novels. One of my new favorites for sure! Can't wait to read more by the author.
0767903862|5.0|I've read this one twice. Fascinating, as usual. I'm still looking for one on New Zealand, Mr. Bryson! Have you been there???
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was such an amazing but tragic story! Can't wait to see the movies!! Hopefully they are as great as the books :) A must read!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO MY SON AND MY STEPSON.  IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOL CHILDREN.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|Indispensável para qualquer um que queira construir um site de sucesso.<br />Ele dá dicas aparentemente óbvias mas que em realidade não priorizamos em detrimento do design.<br />Leitura rápida que flui gostosa pela forma envolvedora de escrita do autor.<br />Recomendadíssimo!
B009YQJ322|3.0|I was thrown off by this movie. I thought it was better and it was  just ok and kinda like other Sci fi movies and prodicable. and DREDD was the Doctor from Star trak.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|The last chapter in this book had me riveted to the page. I have to read the next book, it was an amazing experience. Possibly the best book I have ever read.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I like this movie because I like the Green Lantern and I think the super hero is better then Superman ever would be and I think the powers are kick butt.
0143123165|5.0|This book is made for everyone!<br />It is hardly ever slow, although some people might not be use to the writing style of that time, and has a delightful, strong lead heroine who never falters in her strength like most female characters now-a-days.<br />So beautifully written and should be in everyone's bookcase
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I bought this movie because it would give me the set. Plus it is ok and not as good as the second movie
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Hi my name is Tana and I'm here 2 preform a song 4 you<br /><br />  I were polo and you already no though matching through the hall wit my jeans and my logos yea I were polo you already know though matching through the hall wit my jeans and my logos yea I were polo and you already know though matching through the hall wit my jeans and my logos I go hard in the school I go hard in the paint polo hat polo polo shirt with some jeans and my shoes I awnt tryin
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Excellent flash, very powerful for its size, light and convinient. A must for every D90 user.<br />Gives many flashes - atleast 100 for 2 AA cells.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just like a spy movie playing in my head. Every chapter with more suspense than the first. Excellent kill time reader, that might consume you.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|If you have ever been around farmers and their tractors/riding lawn mowers, you can relate to the characters in this story.  The acting is superb.  I have watched this movie many times and still explode with laughter when he shoots his lawn mower.  Outgrowing your live of independence,especially being permitted to drive, because of failing health is a tragedy which affects all too many of us.  One can relate to the decisions he makes and admire his wisdom and devotion to be reconciled with his brother.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A beautiful touching story of teenage love which was a joy to read. The authors writing style is just terrific.
B003B02PF4|5.0|I am never disappointed with his books.  Afraid to turn the page but couldn't stop. Would love to see this made into a movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great game. I have it on my kindle fire HD. Any ways, I think you should have armor, Endermans, Caves, And Wolves you can tame plus change the collar color!<br />And if you could add more land and have more diamonds and gold and Iron in easy to find places!
B00867GHS8|4.0|Wonderful family movie.  The little ones, 12 and younger will love it.  We had to take several breaks ... our grand kids could only keep the 3D glasses for about a half-hour at a time.<br /><br />We reviewed it because you asked.  It is good entertainment for the whole family.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for college, my medical information, and even use it to save recipes and craft instructions. I have it synced with my pc, my browsers, and  my kindle. I love it
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The 3-dimentionality of these movies was breath-taking ... it added so much to the presentations.  Sometimes people think 3D is just a gimmick, an add-on for kids, but these movies show that when done properly 3D is an integral and essential part of the presentation without which the movie would not be nearly as entertaining and enjoyable.  This seems to me to be the future for movies.  I'm glad I made the investment in 3D equipment.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|On my Kindle HD 8.9, I put in my zip code and then it tells me it can't determine my location. Pretty useless.
B004APVI1G|4.0|It was an interesting story, one we were not familiar with.  The art work was amazing and the 3-D was great.  Of course our little ones loved it.
B0000067L2|5.0|Released in 1967, DISRAELI GEARS was the second album by Cream, the \\"supergroup\\" of guitarist Eric Clapton, bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker. These musicians had distinguished themselves in other groups, but they came together in this power trio and debuted with [[ASIN:B0000067L1 Fresh Cream]] the year before. The debut was straight-up blues rock. We hear such a style here in the songs  \\"Strange Brew\\" and \\"Take It Back\\". But what of the supposed \\"psychedelic\\" turn they made with DISRAELI GEARS?<br /><br />Sure, the cover art is astounding, produced by Australian artist Martin Sharp after initial experiments with LSD in Swinging London (see the memoir [[ASIN:1590201124 Hippie Hippie Shake]] by Sharp's friend Richard Neville, who came with him from Oz, to get an idea of Sharp's new perspectives). Sharp also wrote the lyrics for the song \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\", which sound like a schoolboy's traditional Classics learning filtered through a feverish consciousness.<br /><br />However, the psychedelic touch is mostly subtle, found in somewhat unusual imagery across the tracks, song titles like \\"SWLABR\\" (which stands for \\"She Was Like a Bearded Rainbow\\") and thick production, not in outright drug references or otherworldly wailing. If you come to DISRAELI GEARS expecting consistent acid trip soundscapes, you're likely to be gobsmacked by the Cockney music hall antics of \\"Blue Condition\\" and \\"Mother's Lament\\".<br /><br />Except for that last-mentioned track, the album's closer and something of a piss take, DISRAELI GEARS is a rich and genuinely timeless rock album. Sure, Clapton, Bruce and Baker sound somewhat rough compared to the higher levels of instrumental virtuosity they would rise to in the years to come, but the album is full of memorable playing (and a very distinctive electric guitar tone). The songs here have an epic feel, and it often comes as a surprise to look at the timings and see they clock in at only two or three minutes. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to hear a slice of the 1960s and rock that has stood the test of time.anyone wanting to hear a slice of the 1960s and rock that has stood the test of time.
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|A bit trite ... although our teen grand sons probably didn't think so.  Here are the required seven more words.
0670023329|5.0|A profound story everyone should read.  Well written.  Couldn't put it down, or stop thinking about it afterwards.  Fascinating to read about someone born & raised in a prison camp.  Can't say enough about this book.  And I truly hope Shin can find some peace someday!
B009JBZH54|5.0|My son in law loves Batman and didn't have any of the movies.  He was thrilled at Christmas with the trilogy, we all were very excited.  Thanks Amazon, you delivered once again, Mary Jenkins
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince captured my attention once again with a great Rapp adventure, with another real life story that takes place in today's world.  It is not hard to imagine such a story from actually taking place today.
B007704HO6|5.0|I just finished reading the heart-warming story of a beautiful bond forged between man and cat.  I loved the story and am amazed that it is a true story, with Bob going all over the place with James on the bus and crossing streets on his shoulders. Parts of the story had me feeling anxious because I worried about Bob out in the streets with all those people and cars etc. Always waiting for something bad to happen!  That is the pessimist in me, though. I will also say that parts of the book made me feel a little shame when James would talk about his \\"invisibility\\".  I am guilty of walking by these street people and never giving them a chance...that's the last time. I never want someone to feel dehumanzied or invisible because of me! Bob is a beautiful Ginger kitty that really helped James get his life on track...and I am so proud for both of them to have landed this book deal and hopefully life is GREAT!!  As a cat lover and someone that has been on hard times before...sometimes all you have is your cat!  James I'm proud of you for taking care of Bob and ultimately allowing him to take care of you.  I sure would love to see this book made into a movie.  Good luck to you both!!  And..where can I get some of those groovy scarves for my cats?
B001TWT0AE|5.0|A great John Ford film, one that seemed to justify his method of story telling; When the legend becomes fact, print the Legend.  Says it all.  A great cast, and a wonderful story.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is fun and challenging. I like being interactive in the story. without blood and guts.  My best suggestion is to  USE THE CLUES.  They are helpful but not all telling.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter LOVED this!! She is 8 & put it together all by herself. She now wants all of them! :)
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Great movie. Glad that we can watch the subtitled version as the English dub is terrible!<br /><br />..... . . .
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I only read 20 pages or so. Boring and predictable, nothing original about this book. Total money waste. I just don't get, maybe when you're 17 (which I not)
B00110K62U|5.0|I saw the original cast in London, then later in Los<br />Angeles and Orange County.  I just watched the 25th Anniversary show.  Bottom line,  the original London cast set the bar and although individuals may have given great performances in later casts,  this is the only cast with the REAL Valjean and Javert, the two key protagonists.
B007M45PMU|5.0|If you like their song 'Ho Hey' you will probably love the rest of the album. It has a relaxed feel to it and is smooth from beginning to end. Simple, beautiful songs.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|l had to write a review just to say this movie is beautiful. No words but the video says it all, very powerful and could have watched another two hours easy.
B007V65R54|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about predictions and about human decision making in general.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looks like another season filled with intrigue,  superb acting, and, of course, delicious period clothing! A fun show for peeking into the traditions of ages past.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I was playing Dragon Story until this became available for kindle users. Easy to advance. Earn money quickly (big thing for me coming from Dragon Story). Overally it's a fun &amp; additive game that's a must have.
B000W04S6U|5.0|Nice collection on the CDs of the favorite game my son loves.  Makes his day to lesson to it while doing homework.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My sons and I loved playing this game together!  They're ages for and eight, and it really made them think.  Great game for little brains!
B000VEA38E|5.0|Good sound collection for those that like the Star Wars series.  The price is  very good for the quality of the product.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|This is a novel of lyrical language, that is neither inaccessible or overwrought. Multiple viewpoints and timelines can make the reader focus a little harder at first, but I soon relaxed and felt in secure hands. Nothing is extraneous and everything is interwoven into an exquisite whole.  I often think if a reviewer gives away too much of the story that there is no point in me reading the book. This book follows the story of two children suddenly cast as the pawns in a bizarre wager between two men.  Nevertheless, as they mature, they evolve into people capable of subverting the game. The manner in which they do so is both sacrificial and transcendent. If ever a book lived up to rave reviews, this one did.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you are looking for a book that takes you out of your own world and plops you down in someone else's very crazy world, this is the book for you!  Couldn't put it down till it was done! Even read it in the car!
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a lot like minecraft. It has qiuickly become my daughters favorite app. She loves these types of games and this did not dissappoint
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story really kept me engaged.  Loved the twists in the story as it unfolded and they way she developed the characters.
B005HSL626|4.0|this app is fun if you like slicing fruit. My daughter has fun with it and plays it alot. I played to however my rating would probably only be a 3 as I cant see it holding my attention for very long. However because it is her kindle and app I thought it only fair to let her rate it and it does seem to hold her attention and her friends as well
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC used to have a mobile version of their site with just a vertical list of stories, but this is much more compact
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This seems to be a good app for all ages. I have seen my 2 17 yr old nieces, 23 and 11 yr old daughters as well as a few adults play for hrs non stop. fun and addictive
B00A757EFW|4.0|this is fun it brings me back to my childhood.The kids have to share the kendel to play.Have hours of fun
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|have loved angry birds sinse it first came out. It is a great app for kids and adults. definitely an addictive game
0385535147|5.0|I love Grisham and have for many years. Have most of his books in 1st editions in my home library.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app. I got it free so there are a few adds however only on the main screen and never during your game. It never needs you to purchase anything more although i thought i read you could. Just a fun app. It has quickly become my favorite!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to read the next book. I couldn't put this book down. This is a great series for anyone. Love it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a very fun app and challenging. This is the review of an 11 year old girl however it is one of her favorite apps. both of her parents tried and enjoyed it to.
B005974C94|1.0|Quite frankly I don't know what some of the other reviewers are smoking but I would like some too, because by any objective measures this is a terrible album for any true blues or jazz fans. There is a 10 bit band playing boring charts with little or no improvisation throughout the set. There is a washed up Eric Clapton with a voice that is tired and lacking in emotion, a guitar style that is at best a cliche, and nothing very interesting to say. Finally it is a lousy recording -very low dynamic range and a poor sound.<br /><br />This CD is a dud and one to avoid. As for the positive reviews on Amazon - I have no idea but I guess there are many more rock fans then blue fans. If there are any blues fans out there and they know of a good (and new) recording from last year or two please leave me a comment - I am getting desperate.... (and feel free to visit my blog linked to in my profile).
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game was what started my daughters desire to have a kindle. She bought it as soon as she got her kindle at Christmas and still loves it. She is 11
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Initially hard to watch but you get hooked fast. Every episode ends with you desperately needing to see what happens next....
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.  Held my interest from the first page to the last.  Highly recommend!  Everyone in my circle of family and friends have either read it or are reading it now, and they all agree it is a great read.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Anything put out by Rovio dealing with birds or pigs is a winner. I'm not very good at this game, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's fun to play and very clever. It really makes you think.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|Definitely not what I was expecting. Pointless, and boring. You must pay real money for &quot;gems&quot; or wait forever. No clear goals and ads popping up asking you to rate the game or buy gems. Uninstalled this piece of junk that took up way too much space in the first place.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!! All of the Angry Birds games are the most fun you can have with your clothes on. I play it everywhere...passes the time and challenges you to get all those bad piggies.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I like science fiction stories and I loved it.  The characters did an excellent job.  The special effects were awesome.
B005K17RU0|5.0|really cool app<br />I use it while travelling. I can enter my new location or destination and get the local forecast right away.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I am not a print reviewer so if this doesn't seem professional, that's why.<br /><br />I was living out of country when this series was current.  Stayed at a friend's house for two weeks and they had a couple of rerun episodes recorded, which we watched.  When i came home I immediately ordered the entire series on CD.  (Which I would never do for any other TV show I have yet to see.) So, now is my first viewing of this long-departed series.<br /><br />WOW, is all I have to say.  Best acting; best interpersonal relationships; best actors for each character; best dialogue....  Bottom line is this is simply the best television I have yet to see.

B00198X0VS|5.0|this is a great product and glad we purchased it on amazon. com. The products here are great and we like them.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|This book started out good, but the more I read the more I kept thinking how the author was using the movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" to write a book.  To me, this was just pages and pages of a woman being abused and about her abuser tracking her down.  I know you have to lay the ground work, but this laid the ground work, poured the cement and built the house.  To me the romance got lost in the abuser/abused story.  I got a little over half way through the book and I just couldn't stand to read any more of the husband trying to track Katie down and his crazy bouncing back and forth from fury to crying.  I don't want to read about someone I hate and someone being constantly abused.  I want a romance to concentrate on the story of two people falling in love, and this book just did not have enough of that for me.  I skimmed the book to the end and it was pretty dismal from beginning to right at the very end, and then I asked for my money back.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Dredd is a good film for an audience that wants action and style.  It is one of the better comic adaptations since it does a good job of character building in the little time it has to present personalities.  I would like to have seen more world building than was presented in this film.  I am more interested in what the story has to tell me about the idea of the future than in the actual shooting, mayhem and car crashing.  If the film is popular enough there may be a sequel that does that but for now we have a dark dystopian action movie that makes me want more information.  For me it was worth renting but not buying.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the trilogy.  If you have a open mind you would enjoy the book even though you don't agree with a lot of the issues and things contained in this series.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I could watch and re-watch each episode over and over again.  Always enjoy it.  It's a shame it only went for 2 seasons.  I wish there was a DVD that had only the music videos so I could play it at parties.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Good quality CD.  It was a gift to my friend and she loves it.  She loves Taylor Swift songs.  Satisfied with purchase.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|The series is good but it is way over rated.  It needs to move along a little faster but I am still looking forward to he 2nd season.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Great album. I would recommend to anyone who liked pop music. I have bought their other albums as well. Go out and buy it.
B00867GK26|5.0|Finding Nemo on Blu-ray was a Christmas present for my son with autism. He loves watching it. It's his favorite!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Movie was made too quickly after the Casino Royale movie. Was like a Bourne Movie<br />CD was received in good order
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A few too many jokes and snide comments, but overall held my attention and was an enjoyable read.  Would get next book from DeMille
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A little smutty, laughed some, cried some, and all the parts in the book fit together wonderfully ... a lot of late nights cuz I couldn't put it down! Of the three &#34;Fifty&#34; books this was my favorite!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You won't be able to put this game down!  The time just whizzes by when you're playing, it's just that much fun!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|...but once I started reading book one, and found out more about the characters, it was an interesting read. It made me want to continue to book two. Great work author!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Even as an adult I enjoyed this. My kids loved it included the teenagers. The supporting cast is what makes the show.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Finished book one and just had to continue to book two...then three! Book two was definitely darker, and held my interest. After a while though, I tended to 'roll my eyes' reading the intimate scenes, and couldn't wait to read on...the emails were fun, and the adventures were intense! E L James is a great author!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Enjoyable movie.  Granddaughter love it.  Her new favorite movie at the moment.  Don't know what more I can say, but 18 words or more it must be.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I bought this app thinking it would be fun. I was way wrong. It was so confusing, I Had no idea what I was doing. Yeah  there were some directions but they were even confusing. There's too much different things you have to remember. As soon as I played it for 10 minutes I was  frustrated. Uninstall
B00447L4JG|5.0|My adult children like this movie.  If you enjoy Tim Burton movies you like this one. Really wouldn't recommend for younger children.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The story told by Marcus Luttrell keeps you on the edge of your seat as he describes the hell he and his team went through during their mission. The heartbreak and sadness is gripping as the tale of the death of his three fellow SEALS is told.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Granddaughter wants to watch this movie over and over again.  Its a Dr Suess movie,don't know what more I can say, but 18 words or more it must be.
