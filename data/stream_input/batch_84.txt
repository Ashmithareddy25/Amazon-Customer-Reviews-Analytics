B000C8T8CG|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B002UMUHVS|5|Essential for tow bars. Easy to install. No binding when turning.
B0002SRCMO|5|Never had a plastic fastener tool before. This thing is perfect for pulling all types of plastic automotive fasteners - interior door panels, wiring bundle holders, push in clamps and more. Like most other Lisle tools, it is a good tool for the money. Beats trying to remove plastic fasteners with a screw driver and it doesn't damage the fastener or the surrounding area.
B001NZVKZK|4|Universal cables just don't work smoothly and cause problems while adjusting.
B001GJ3DZS|5|It works and does it job.. 5 star....
B00CHD6QXI|5|very happy with bumper!
B00RGQ1OJW|5|fits perfect on a  ninja zx14
B00JZQXJ3K|5|This hitch went on in less than an hour!  No need to remove the bumper cover or the tow hook.  Wiring was simple plug and play.  Easy as pie!
B007ISGLZA|5|[[VIDEOID:957dec8954904a37e80433f37727fdf8]] I absolutely LOVE this system!!<br /><br />First, I have always loved my 2011 Explorer Limited 4WD; however, always felt it was a bit sluggish.  Now, don't get me wrong, I realize she's no Corvette or anything, and seats 7 with the 3rd row, but to have 290 ponies under the hood, I've always wanted a bit more punch.  The torque is a bit lacking already on the Explorer, so I was willing to try anything.  In addition to the power, I was also looking to increase fuel economy.  Mine is not the flex fuel version, and although mileage wasn't terrible 16-17 city, 22-25 hwy, I felt there could be room for improvement.<br /><br />Since installing the kit (which was quite easy if you follow along slowly, and carefully with the instructions, took about 45 minutes from hood up to down), I can honestly say the kit has impressed me in all areas!  In addition to increasing power you can feel in the seat, it also added a nice tone, which is very pronounced & loud, but only when it should be (i.e., your into the throttle a good bit).  If you're cruising around at highway speeds or consistent, you don't hear it at all, but if you get into the throttle, it sounds MEAN!<br /><br />I am going to try and post a video of a 0-60 run in the Explorer from inside the cab, windows up, and no radio.<br /><br />Having said all the above, this kit isn't for everyone!  Those who enjoy a super quiet ride, don't get this, period!  You will hear it, every time you drive, at some point during acceleration, but i'm cool with that, and what I DO hear is very aggressive and enjoyable, not to mention the benefits from a HP and MPG perspective.
B000WMPJUW|4|I bought two and am still using the first one after 8,000 miles.
B00HCVRPY4|5|me gusto mucho
B005BNP7Z4|5|a true bowtie fan
B00T9AGBOQ|1|It came with broken charger! The light will not shut off when you turn it on.<br />Poor quality charger!
B000BQYH6Q|5|Life saver
B001DRNCQI|5|Fixed the problem quick and easy! Much cheaper than going to a mechanic!
B0038AVHGU|5|You won't regret getting these, gives the truck a more custom looks...
B002BHWWVA|1|broke after having it one day! do not buy!
B0016I9XS0|5|Installed as easy as described, looks good on the Jeep
B002ZS4QCS|3|I have a Ford F150 and these guys are apparently designed for skinnier seats.  They almost stick straight out from the top of the seat. I still use them but if you're expecting them to lay down nicely over the back of your seat and you have a truck, adjust your expectations.
B009TB5KG0|5|This floor mat is far superior to the Weathertech one i purchased for my Q5 (which I returned, and bought this MaxSpider one). This fits a million times better, is lighter, and the weird velcro-like backing to it really secures it in place. It is easy to clean, nothing sticks to it including dog hair.
B000C5G886|3|It works but doesn't really fit with Ford Taurus.
B00P3O22MW|3|The inserts fit great but the pocket is too shallow to fully fit the inner tie rod end.  That prevents the crow foot insert from being able to be locked in. That means you have to hold the insert in place with one hand while torquing the other end with one hand.  The application being attempted is a 2009 Malibu.
B00X9WMB7Q|3|My husband had to modify it to make it fit don't think they're cutting them the same
B00F17Q8BM|5|Bought this to extend the reach of my RV for electrical service.  It is durable and heavy and works great.  As heavy as the cord attached to the RV.
B00ASY29AM|5|Finally something that solved my trailer lighting woes!  This is it for LED trailer lights / newer european rigs.  Get it and your troubles are over.
B00AXMSWAK|2|This carburetor fits fine on my 50cc scooter but it doesn't work very well for very long. When its working well, it works great, though.
B001G7KQN2|5|Arrived early and fit perfect<br />Thanks
B00Z7N7KGW|5|Brush Hero is the best thing that's happened to auto wheel cleaning in a long, long time. If you're fed up with taking too long to clean your car wheels, yet you want them to look good, Brush Hero is your answer. Forget taking your car to a car wash, having to wait and then having to PAY for it. Plus, they may not even clean your wheels to your satisfaction.<br />  You screw the Hero onto your hose, turn the water on (it has an on-off lever on the handle).  Prepare your wheels, use your favorite wheel cleaner,<br />turn the Hero on and let it do the work!  The brush will turn while water comes out.  You'll wonder why you didn't get this sooner! (Or where it's been all your life).  The Hero will save you scrubbing time, and it'll do a BETTER JOB CLEANING YOUR WHEELS!<br />  Use the soft black brush for your wheels.  There is a firmer white brush, but I haven't used mine.  Ladies will REALLY appreciate the Brush Hero.  Sure, it costs, but this will pay you back in SAVED LABOR over and over!<br />  I could go on, but I urge you to try it for yourself.  Plus, and more importantly,  the company stands behind the Hero.
B003KK5OE4|5|Love it!
B007PG4KIU|4|Nice and easy to put on but must have two people to do it right
B0050VFAOK|1|Didn't fit in my car outlet full. When it did, a green light came on; this turned orange whenever I tried plugging anything in and did completely nothing.
B00MB8XT8E|1|LEDs burn out quickly and the  magnets are lightweight. The unit is not as bright as you may think. For the price it's a bargain but far from  professional grade.
B000066OC8|4|Used it to keep our cell phones charged while on a camping trip. Totally worked for that purpose.
B00GHT48NI|5|It works and fits perfectly
B00KSXVSIC|5|Giving out the true color w acceptable price. I don't know ghey have error free kit which made me bought another ballast to make the kit worked. The bulb is still compatible....
B002C5YU20|4|Looks fantastic, but it's very thin, and the points peel up very easily. I highly doubt it would survive a Chicago winter.  A snow scraper would kill it.  Luckily, mine is on my hot rod which gets stored in the winter.
B0013916XW|5|Thank very good product
B00HTP8N0I|5|Keeps the wife happy with no scratches on the bars.
B000C93CR2|5|WORKED GREAT!
B00QHA3356|4|Pretty good!
B007ZF9JHI|5|Nice product fast shipping
B000EPR36A|3|Did not fit my 92 Chevy grill properly, was too large to fit into the insert.
B00DZEA1W0|5|Very nice product...looks really nice on my CTS-V :)
B00WUG1A6U|1|[[VIDEOID:df2a38b066eabcdce237bf082d871db4]]UPDATE 15 Months Use - One light has stopped completely  The other is flickering (see video).  These were fine one day and not working the next.  12 Month warranty.  Which I understand but you should get more use from $50 lights than 15 months.  I would not recommend.  Couldn't be more happy. Easy install on my 2010 Nissan Maxima. Easy places to mount the control box. Both sides installed in about 30 mins.
B001GMX9FO|5|This product is super. I was originally going to pay a mechanic to wire my car and it was going to cost me over $200 USD. With this product I was able to do it myself without a need to do any wire cutting.
B007IKOX7Q|5|Cool little Air Filter for my 50cc Gy6 4 wheeler. Snug fit works great!
B0029VETDW|3|it made it to New Orleans and most of the way back
B004VRLC8M|3|Seems like the scent is a little worn out compared to the same product I get at the car wash.
B0089Q9IZ0|1|This thing did not even hold on to the helmet that well, I used it once and tossed it in the garbage.
B000I1CCCA|5|Don't bother with plastic oil filter wrenches.  This is THE best to remove a Mercedes Filter cartridge.  I ruined two plastic ones and finally bought this out of frustration.  This will last a lifetime as will your Mercedes.
B006ZZ7N6S|3|Besides the fact they did not fit the seats in my car they are nice
B001V8U12M|4|Good product
B00REJXFM0|5|Awesome deal.<br />It is EASY  to install and remove.
B00ST2H3B0|5|Excellent
B00D8RYGOI|5|excellent quality , I got it mounted my self as soon as it came, It shines really bright too
B00TP0I210|4|Product arrived sooner then deliver date.  Was a bit of a pain to put on but thanks to youtube videos I was able to follow the instructions with some minor changes.  So far it has worked like a charm.
B001GJ9K8C|5|I love it
B000NVW2LG|5|worked great.
B000NU6RG8|2|overpriced
B0034BYIL4|5|works as expected
B0091FK0NW|5|Perfect Replacement!
B0006GF5SK|4|Still not as good as original product !
B00ABYVT64|5|Not much to say for these, all three bottles worked well.
B002QU0HEG|5|Put it on my husband's 64oz flask and he loves it!
B006R170LI|5|nice and bright
B00S7X5ST0|5|&#60;3 it!!
B00XW9P2NQ|5|Works great.
B0002UQATS|5|Quick ship and low price on a high quality wax.
B00GURRNQG|5|Fits fine,looks good
B000P9EP5W|5|My original airlift failed after about 7 years- wasn't creating enough vacuum. Decided to try the newer design and so far so good. Is easier to use as a result of not having to switch hoses.
B000CSKN98|5|Shipped fast, just as described.  Easy to install and good price!
B00A0GIJHA|5|It fits well.
B00LFL8FGY|5|Perfect replacement for my 2000 sentra
B00NBUHCKC|3|Did not fit correctly and was missing end piece to attach to carb
B007QWLPUY|5|A+
B008HRZPXU|4|Great shift knob for the money.  I have had it for a few months now and couldn't complain.  Put a little thread locker on the set screws and you won't have a problem.  The paint is a little thin (thus 4 instead of 5 stars) but still looks cool as it wears
B010H0QV7S|5|What a great gadget - a must-have for any car. This tire gauge emergency tool not only measures 4 different types of tire pressure, it also has a flashlight featuring white and red LED light, digital display, glass hammer for breaking windows, screwdriver, pliers, scissors, seat belt cutter and safety lock. Love it.
B000CFME2A|5|Good product. Arrived on time.
B0031787WW|5|Crazy fast shipping!!!  This is a supplier and a product you NEED for your V-star.  It feels like a new bike now.
B000UKM6LG|5|A+ product. Description was accurate and they seem to be holding up.
B000C3ZCJE|5|They work fine with  my  new sport springs. Wish they came with boots instead of having to order them separately.
B008INWF0O|5|My favorite vehicle cleaner. Removes bugs better than all I have tried. I have 2 street bikes a custom harley Davidson road king and brand new honda cbr and I use it 90% of the time to clean the entire bike incuding shield, crome, custom paintjob and it does clean the tires but I would not use it for that unless your in a bind. I carry a can of this and a clean microfiber cloth with me at all times with my harley. I have used the harley brands and they don't hold up as well and leave a residue harder to cleanup. I can be riding all through the night for days and stop to do a quick wipe down and the paint looks as if it just rolled of the line and been cleaned polished and waxed. And when you clean with this the surface feels silky smooth and shines the beauty of the bike. Not sure how well it works with flat paint jobs. Started using this in 2010 and even tried some of the other brands in the shops. But none as of now do a better than Original does. I use it also on my cars to remove all bugs and smudges the car wash guys miss or neglect to remove.  A specially on the front of my cars. Yes you can get your bike looking as good with other products but it takes less then 5 minutes to complete my bike as if it was detail at a shop for over a hundred dollars. Now if the detailer happens to be a beautiful woman wearing very little clothing or nothing at all then I would go that route for sure. Ride safe all
B0087NB23Q|3|You get what you pay.  No VOX control, so if you use it on UTV or ATV you can hear the engine.
B010PUUI1K|5|This tire pressure gauge is pretty handy to have around.<br />It has a fairly large LCD screen, along with a flashlight for using in the dark. It's easy to read as well.<br />The whole thing is contoured to fit your hand well, so it is easy to hold and use.<br />This measures in PSI, BAR, KPA, and KGF/CM2. So you're covered no matter what.<br />The other great thing about this is it contains a window breaker, and a seat belt cutter. So if for some reason, you're ever in a jam and need those, for instance, a wreck, then you have them!<br />Overall it's a great tire pressure gauge and I highly recommend it.<br />I received this at a discount for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way.
B004IME2ZK|5|fast shipping great product, will defiantly come back shopping again....
B001FAGK4O|5|great
B000C1WB86|3|Half of the spark plugs where broken in the dam box! They looked like they where thrown in the box like no one cared
B00M0GFWIM|5|Good product...
B006QH6XQG|5|awesome, great tool
B00SSKCAMA|4|Beautiful product didn't come with A pack of tissue like it sId it would though !
B00873J0YY|5|loved the racks, the post office was very slow.
B00OO10HSG|5|did the job
B0079XBC5I|5|Great Helmet for the $$. I wear a 7 5/8 hat size and the XXL is a little small. The sizing chart says XXL goes up to an 8 hat size. The more I wear it the better it fits (little bit of a break in period)....Its a sharp looking helmet!
B005WKJEZ0|5|Excellent instructions and super easy install on my 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.  My Santa Fe Sport came pre-wired for a hitch and literally was just two plugs and that's it.  Used the CURT 58001 Easy Mount Electrical Bracket and its perfect.
B00ONIX9SK|4|look great , but holes did not line up so well , and clips are not the greatest . if u are good at turning wrenches and have some other tools available you shouldnt have a problem . One small tip to help you can drill out the original holes on fender flares slightly bigger  for more movement . shipping is on time !!
B00JVRZB1G|4|Used these before, Works great.
B009W9AUS2|4|Would be cooler if it was spring assisted.
B000BG1X54|5|I never want to be without this Siphon again. I was spilling gasoline all over my lawn mower and the gas can always got too heavy. It is so EASY to use. Works on gravity so be sure to keep the container above the gas tank. I put it on my tailgate and drive my mower next to it. My cussing days are over.
B00ZV0X46G|5|Great product and fast delivery!!
B008JGLJ02|3|After installing this, I noticed that the fit wasn't very snug. There was a 3/16 inch gap.
B0050I3DC4|4|They were a present for someone else and when received he like them.  I don't know how they went on.
B00GXX983I|5|Everthing as promised.
B00GHRUQEK|5|Thank you.<br />I'am very Pleased
B00411X8ZI|5|Fit my Sienna 2012 XLE AWD
B00CAYC886|5|Good quality, nice size for motorcycle, easy to clean screen. American made, which is nice.
B0009IK5US|2|they said it would fit my wrangler tj and no it did not too big
B00NIKN2BS|5|These tire irons worked great for changing my scooter tires. 5 stars.
B00AFO749Q|2|It broke as I tried to fit a SMALLER THAN AVERAGE tissue box in. Would not recommend
B000B8JUAW|3|Fits my car very tightly. (Is this a generic fit )?  Plastic construction. Somewhat flimsy as the locking mechanism came apart from the screw part. It makes me a little nervous everytime I fill up.... will it open or will it not .... I would look for a more solidly constructed mechanism. Have used it for at least 40 fill ups at this time.
B004ZF4MO6|5|I had a problem with the HID. They tried to fix it. Replaced them with LED. No problems don't heat up like the others. Easier to install.
B0031I808M|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00IS93EW6|4|I have a few questions about the installation part, Anyone care to contact me? Other then that the fenders look amazing and can't wait to get then on!
B00ZR7WLEE|5|These lights are the best for lighting up your camper .
B00I50553E|5|My 2014 f150 sits perfect now. Only thing is you have to disassemble the strut assembly starting with 2014 model year.
B00RECXIDI|2|Ok, first the good points:<br />Clamps are not expensive.<br />They are beefy.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The minimum inside clamping diameter is &#62; 42 mm. They rattle around freely instead of clamping on my 41 mm motorcycle forks.<br />They are larger than I would have preferred in my application, and would create some interference if I could have mounted them.<br />There needs to be some sort of vibration consideration and some protection for the item these are clamped on. Used as-is, they will marr the mounting surface with the teeth inside the clamp. A piece of rubber tubing could solve this.<br />The paint/finish on the clamps arrived already damaged. Packaging was poor. Loose hardware may have damaged the finish but from the size of the marks I expect they were already damaged when packed.
B00GXRM6ME|5|good
B000J1Y33A|5|Great tool. Works very well.
B000C15D8G|4|Good replacement but plugs did not work used my old ones, I'm sure that did away with the warranty  !
B00KVOKKJG|5|I use these all the time and have never had an issue with one from this seller. Thanks!
B00S68U8GO|5|It was so AWESOME!! I bought a second one!
B003COTFS4|5|a+
B00K1VYPL8|5|fit great only thing is there was no directions but was easy install after looking at the part and mounting location. if you have or-fab skid plate for your DEF tank you will need to modify one bracket by grinding the bracket of the step will not mess with the structure of the step.
B00E9CZLF4|5|I made a mistake when ordering, but it came as described on page really wanted one silver.
B00Y5NL1MO|4|Works great<br /><br />Universal wiring could be made better and directions could be more descriptive
B004GC9QW6|5|Perfect fit at a great price.  My internal hardware was easy to transfer to the new part and functioned properly.  I highly recommend this new part as opposed to finding something from a salvage yard.
B002NBLFCG|5|Working well no leaks
B001D6GYLO|1|Received the sun-force and it doesn't even work, very disappointed!
B000EDSSKW|5|Expensive but a nice safety addition to our RV.
B0052FRT2A|1|no
B00N1E71BS|2|very cheaply made. But they were great with a refund!
B00DDVU6EI|4|Ver good product.
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Purchased the 9000 mAh version for my wife's car. I charged it early June and tossed it in the car and promptly forgot about it. Early August rolls around and my wife is stranded at work because the car won't start. This product got the car going 4 or 5 times before I got to a mechanic the next day where it was verified that the battery was bad. Very happy I purchased it and glad it worked as advertised. The only suspicious thing is the display still shows 100% charge even after those 4 or 5 jumps. The 9000 mAh version came with a nice plastic case to hold everything.
B006WQSD1O|4|Seems to be handling OK the high vibration is gone but I still have another to put on
B00JFTC0T6|1|Not for size, ended up having to super glue it on, the plastic turned streaks of a lighter color, poor quality make for a cheap alternative.
B001DH6EH2|5|ordered this for my pastors suv, worked great
B002V0AIWW|5|Use this on my lawn mower and works great exactly as advertised. The one I replaced this with was 30 years old let's see if this is the last one I'll have to buy! Seems well enough made for a DIYer I don't think you want to get this if you are using it repeatedly as a mechanic though.
B003YCZ1F0|4|Excellent no complain about it.
B000182DVU|5|good fit
B003AV69OM|5|Installed both front and rear with the same &#34;ThermoQuiet&#34; pads. It's been a month now since this review and I am very satisfied with this product. It is indeed quiet. The best money I've spent on my vehicle! Now that my pads are new and thick, my braking experience is now smoother, quieter, and more sensitive. 2009 Toyota Venza V6.
B00L1CNWCO|5|This shirt is a symbol of love after death ~ I surprised my husband when I had bought this shirt as I don't typically wear shirts with skulls but he was so elated when I explained the meaning of the shirt he just kept smiling . Nice fit and very comfortable as well as quality. I ordered a large as I am 140# bust size 36C
B0002JN2EU|5|good product great price
B00UU1DPRY|5|As long as you have right receiver this is a very simple installation. Just attach it to receiver. No sweat. Great picture. We just place it on the ground when our Traveler can't get to satalite
B00FNR0F3W|5|Just as advertised.
B00171V1WC|3|Amazon said this was compatible with my 2011 Nissan Juke. It is the right size, but doesn't fit into the wiper arm the way it should. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it hasn't fallen off yet.
B008A0MG0E|2|The reviews said it would fit but no luck
B00SBZRKEU|5|Very nice and easy to use. Use when objects are level for best results.
B00II5YDQ6|5|Very cool. Works great.
B00WT9NS2C|5|I ordered the grey & they are great!  Rugged sturdy material & yet easy to cut to fit. They've got a tad bit of an odor when the car has been locked on a sunny day but not a big deal, less & less. They make a great addition to easy car upkeep for a hard driven car.
B00VAOA2X0|5|Easy to cut, lies flat. Great buy. Honda wanted $189 for theirs!
B00L7FC9JW|3|you get what you pay for
B00LZSEKP2|5|I bought 2 of these seal belt extenders because my sons car seat was blocking the buckle. It works great!
B00BBXHL48|5|perfect for my Traverse 2015! love it!
B002MQCYO0|5|Great spray for plastics that you don't want scratched when cleaning.
B007OW6M0Y|5|good
B001DRH4JO|5|Can't say too much about a pigtail.  It either works or doesn't.  This one did and fit perfectly.
B00TO9H68W|4|I used this for a weekend on the river. I placed two bags of ice in it with some drinks. After sitting in the back of my 4Runner with the sun beating down on it for a full day, it kept everything cold. Some of the ice survived the entire weekend. The drinks stayed cold the whole time!
B00R244HCE|5|Duplicolor products seem to get better and better.
B001P20Q1U|5|Beautiful great looking. I'm getting one more. Awesome.
B00480J4JG|5|Just as described
B00H79TPVM|5|Easy to stay hydrated while riding!
B004YJYQPS|1|I have owned my  about 5 yrs I travel alot, Id like to tell you all the things good about the RVND 5510, ok so<br />1. Use it for skipping on the water, make sure its a calm day,and flic your wrist when you release it.<br />2. Use it for target practice, great for the kids with 22cal. or pellet gun!<br />3. Use it as a paper weight,or to hold napkins from blowing off the picnic table.<br />4. Use it as a pocket weapon,Someone sneaks up on you, you YELL STOP I have a RVND5510 Ill hit you if you mess with me!<br />5. Use it to relieve your frustration, place it on a concrete floor,smash with hammer until you feel relieved.(of course wear safety glasses)<br />6.Use it for anything EXCEPT for accurate directions, OH it will direct you, Way out of the way! IT WILL MAKE YOU NUTS!<br />CHECK YOUR I PHONE and compare, THEN LOOK at a regular paper MAP! yeah I know a PAPER MAP hahahaha! you will see.
B00WJHK1XS|1|I normally do not write bad reviews, but this pump only worked on my 660 Rhino for about 30 minutes before it quit pumping. I had bought it about a month earlier just to have on hand incase mine quit. Well, the one that was on it quit right when I needed it, so I thought no big deal, I already have another one. Put it on and it worked excellent for about 1/2 hour, then just would not pump anymore. So I ran to the local parts store and picked up a low pressure electric fuel pump and installed it. Got to finish what I needed done and it's still working great. No more vaccuum pumps for me!!
B001OC1SDQ|5|Perfect, works like a charm
B007GR54FQ|4|I have used this product for years with good results. There are a couple of things that the user should be aware of though. The first thing is that this is mainly a conditioner and while there is black added to it, for severe fading a dye maybe a better choice. As a result, I think that there may be a tendency for some to use too much of the product in an effort to get it darker and in doing so putting too much product on the leather. If the excess isn't then wiped off, there will likely be some color transfer. I use it on all my bikes and riding boots with no color transfer problems. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it can make a motorcycle seat very slick for a while. I always put much less on the riding seat itself as a result of this issue. On the upside, the product application is fast which is great because I would rather be riding than detailing! If you do like this product, the larger bottle is a much better choice for the price.
B00SI6V2BO|1|Left thumb got a hole in the end in only 2 weeks and only used to ride nothing else.
B004GEKELG|4|Assemble is a perfect match for the original. Even comes with a light. Only issue is the light that comes with it, is not a match to the original. It may have caused an electrical issue. After removing the light, the check engine light went off.
B006E4KG5U|5|These work great as a replacement for fixtures with failed ballasts.  Simple installation.
B003RQBKLC|5|Love love this charger... Will buy again
B000N9OE1E|5|It's 3M works great.
B000E28C6S|4|good
B00KJVXOJE|5|Works great! Installed 1 year ago, no issues whatsoever!
B006LNWE7W|5|Love this product for noise reduction for installing sound systems.
B00S1N8BJ0|5|great fit, fast shipping just as I had hoped, well done I will order stuff from them again
B00008RW9V|5|Works Well
B000CMJQ88|5|Now I'm not worried if my boots are muddy or covered by snow.!!
B006HYKTU4|4|This set not compatible with a '15 Odyssey. Bulbs work as described where compatible
B00GJZ2I6O|5|The visibility of the helmet is excellent, the fitment for my head is great, though is a bit tight squeezing through the bottom. I really enjoy the visor, the detachable chin bar and the visor. It truly makes riding much more enjoyable when you have an option to go with a different helmet style depending on your how you plan on riding.
B00RM327NG|4|Pros:<br />- Small profile, you barely notice the mount when not in use<br />- Magnet fits between phone and case so you can set it and forget it<br />- Mount fits onto AC vent securely, good quality materials<br />- Easy, mindless mount and unmount - no need to press a button or hold your tongue just right to get it to release. While also driving.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Only adjustable insofar as your AC vent is adjustable.<br />- A little bouncy on rough roads, the power cord has fallen out a couple of times<br /><br />Things I was afraid would be cons, but so far haven't happened:<br />- The magnet sticking to any and everything metal<br />- The magnet erasing my memory card<br />- The magnet making my case not fit<br /><br />Overall very happy with this purchase and glad I chose this over a more traditional car mount.
B00SP286RE|1|faded decal... looks awful
B007R6JQZK|5|looks awesome
B000VTULM2|5|fit my car perfectly no proplem  installing it.
B000BZ6YRM|1|loose
B00M3ENQXE|5|wow - easy to program at a fraction of the cost anywhere else. would definitely buy again if I ever have the need
B00KVP2GO2|5|Easy to use with the right equipment and putting it together was very easy. Make sure you know what you are doing before you start and take your time doing it.
B00464GO7O|3|it is an ..ok blade fits many other cars not just mercedes nothing like the real thing.
B00ZV1N62C|5|Installed in less than 20 minutes and looks great on my 2012 Sedona.  Looks just like the picture posted for the product.  Gives the minivan a sportier look and needed for luggage rack and other accessories.  Great buy and the cheapest out there for the Sedona.
B00ZUDDOAK|3|I like it just dint came with instructions but only took me 20 mins to install
B006FQ4OUA|4|A very similar unit! The electronics from my old unit fit right in. The rubber is off a bit, so when depressing the unlock - lock, it sticks.
B00E822P3G|4|The helmet was ok for the prise and the  Bluetooth worked fine,with a good audio quality. The helmet was smaller so i had to return it.
B00YBFUM6C|4|I am sure it will last a long time, just seemed a bit flimsy compared to the old one.
B00DDOSNH2|5|Using in a 5th wheel to conserve batteries.  Bright but not glaring, we're very happy with these lights, replacing the hot high intensity bulbs. Tested several, all seem to be good.
B00IUDK0XQ|5|fit our 1998 Jeep Wrangler great!
B0007ZAJRM|5|Transmission in my Olds Intrigue (4T65-E) would start clunking every once in a while after getting hot.  Put this in and, knock on wood, there hasn't been any clunking since in 3 months or so.
B00GXJIFBS|4|Wasn't quite as heavy duty as the OE. But compared to $190 we can live with it. Bought 2 just incase
B00CS3L952|5|Put it on my 05 LLY and it works awesome, no more having to wait for the motor to lug down before finally downshifting to 4th!  Instructions are a little vague but not bad.
B000C7QLT0|5|Great fit just like OEM part. Fast shipping, works perfect.
B00KQX5D3K|5|Fit perfectly.
B0082GL0MQ|5|Very satisfied with the quality.
B0047N1ANW|4|Holds the iPad securely on the back of the headrest. It locks for view at many angles, but is not the best for viewing across the entire vehicle. We have a Tahoe and the mount works great if we can push the front passenger seat all the way forward, and tilt the seat up. Otherwise the kids can touch the screen (leading to yelling/screaming/etc), or cannot see it (view blocked by carseat)
B0002UEOLO|5|clean it up and apply. go back years later and no seizeing.
B005N53AM2|3|Very cute but does nothing to heat/cool the steering wheel. Leaves a faint odd smell on my hands and can get very hot or cold during the respective seasons. I'm not picky enough to take it off or buy a new one but it's purely for display and not for comfort.
B008P04PXU|5|I bought this item because I found it very expensive in my country -Saudi Arabia- and it work very good until now.
B00ENJIWIG|5|Exactly as described, a 2.5&#34; OEM donut gasket. Used this with a Grimmspeed 3&#34; to 2.5&#34; adapter on a Cobb catback for my 07 WRX.
B00C8E9CTQ|5|Worked as expected.
B00Y1HQ5M0|5|very good quality and I think they are just like the original ones
B003SYXMA0|5|worked good
B00C9WFVM4|5|Very good quality for the price.
B002SB04CS|5|Excellent buy. At the Toyota dealership cost is $100. Very satisfied.
B007MSI79Y|5|Seems like a decent quality tank for the money. I secured mine in place using steel banding which also helps support the tank when it's full. So far I've had no complaints and plan on adding a second tank.
B003NI1PP0|5|Best price and quality part! Thank you!
B00VBRUTBG|5|Great product
B008BTLIYY|4|it's a battery, it starts the bike. prolly made in china. what are you going to do?
B000TDQGCE|5|I have broken many cleats over the last two years when the water gets a little rough. So far the CIPA CS 100 has held up well. I feel these will be the last cleats I will have to replace. Completely satisfied to date.
B00BJF0CK8|4|It works like a champ....
B005LXO0X4|5|Great fit and look for my truck!
B008M4R716|5|works great!!
B009S9RQTC|5|worked as it should. looks great.
B004PQOT8Y|4|Awesome look!
B000IYBERG|5|Can't go wrong with NGK parts.
B000CHGJH4|5|Great product !
B00G4RVZ4I|5|Excellent. Low price. Matched my car paint.
B0076D9QFO|5|Great product !
B008XKLAFI|4|Worked Great. Would have liked if they supplied the programming instructions, however there is ton of them on YouTube.
B00681BDXI|5|perfect
B003THLHYE|5|They look great...easy to install
B008JORKP2|5|Love love love it
B0006SH4NC|4|Good product just not for windows.
B005GG5Q3Y|5|Great product! Made out of a very nice, high-quality material. No problem at all sticking, no bubbles when applying, looks great! I would recommend this to anyone looking for something like this. For the horde!
B00COOS6F6|4|I researched many kits and decided to go with Opt-7 Blitz Relay Bundle because the parts look sturdier than most. It was delivered on time and I tested the ballast & cables to be working fine. I bought it for my wife's  2006 Jeep Commander.  [ UPDATE]  I have installed the whole 9006 kits on my wife's 2006 Jeep Commander and all went fine, bulbs shine brightly with a hontnof blue as expected for the 8000k bulb.
B0041CDPQO|4|It works great
B00VM44FG8|5|Excellent helmet, great engineering  for a modular helmet.
B000CN9NSK|4|works very well.
B006CRT72W|5|Very easy to program.
B00HEZQHQU|5|Mpgs inproved slightly
B0060YH01W|5|Good product so far but time will tell how long they would last?
B0002UEOPA|5|Works great for exhaust gaskets
B00RWLMZC6|5|Easy to install, hooked them up to existing fog light relays, however I did blow a 15 amp fuse when running them while moving through water off road.
B00FPDZ638|4|fast delivery and met expectations
B00IS93BCE|5|Great kit I have used it many of times and never had an issue
B00FH8P1DG|5|Very Bright and very inexpensive
B0095FBDTS|5|Best price I have seen and quick shipping. Changed to this oil on my first oil change and feels a lot better and better mpg.
B007HOG97K|4|Superb lock... for motorcycle not necessarily a bicycle
B003UI3KP6|5|PERFECT MATCH
B00ONHBG54|2|Perfect fit out of the box and half the price of the local auto parts store. Failed after about two months, the body of the unit started to separate. Will be replacing this with an OEM with lifetime warranty.
B00AYH2SMC|2|very nice but over priced
B00FC22MDY|4|These lights are extremely bright... When they work. 50% of the time i have to turn my lights off/on for them to turn on. There's times where they will just sit there and flicker.. Also Installing these are simple... so I thought, they would not clip into the plug at all. It took some serious surgery to make these things work. I may be returning them for a different brand that will hopefully fit better, but I do love Innovited. I have them with one of my cars and they were easy and quick to install. This specific size for my truck wasn't too easy.
B00ES5Q610|2|It looked the same as the OEM Toyota blade assembly I took off and was easy to install, but this one is slightly too long for my 2013 RAV4 and hits the rear center tail light and gets stuck there. The fit for my vehicle was confirmed by Amazon so either this was a fluke or this is not a valid application for this pn.
B00B2FCAXW|5|You can't beat the price.  Much better than buying them at the auto parts store.
B00LTX30MW|5|does increase the sound of motor I paired mine with a k&n intake and was able to go from 27 mpg to 33 hwy. acceleration is much more responsive.
B0009V1WS4|4|Works well, but a bit sticky in the lock sometimes.
B008I7OKM6|5|This spare mirror fitted pretty well to my sonata. Thanks to the seller.
B00BV65DUO|3|For the price, i would have assumed the stickers would be bigger, i purchased them to match my cars mechanical modifications and show off the Skunk2 stickers but i suppose that did not work out.<br />Would not buy again.
B00VYYW2O8|5|these worked perfect great deal
B000AUMVJ8|1|The hood wasn't damaged during shipping however when we installed it it didn't fit at the left seem. The gap between the left fender and the hood is substantial compared to the right side. Also the left side is warped upwards towards the front. I wish I could trade it for another that fits better.
B003ESKIHU|5|great tool
B007GIYNJS|5|I had it on in about 15 minutes after watching the how to video on you tube. Fits my new 2015 F150 5 1/2' bed truck like a champ.
B004NSJQYQ|5|These lights fit my 1500 Silverado like OEM, bolt holes lined up perfect ,and installed within 1 hour, and the price (cheap), I highly recommend these to anyone to buy. Shipping was very quick and boxed like fragile glass, but lens are plastic.
B00N2DK3T0|5|Great
B002PN53DO|5|great price and quality product
B00NIX0IDU|5|Strong and substantial OEM product.  However these will not work if your Colorado has the factory wheel flares!  Be warned!
B00HRXMYZ2|5|My 82' CB900c has been breathing' deep!
B00QVLV1VY|3|The wires in the back get in the way of install of the light strip because there is too much slack wire between lights and there are no cutouts for wires between lights so you end up pushing the excess back in as you tighten the screws and the two screw holes have no slots so... you had better mark and drill the holes perfect first time or you will find yourself drilling again. Still the lights work and look fine once one gets by these slight install problems.
B00I5HRTU4|5|worked to secure our old car to trailer
B0118XI3PG|2|The connector piece doesn't fit a 2006 Cayenne S model.
B000EQR5O4|5|This will fit a 2004 Pontiac Bonneville SLE.  Works great and is an easy DIY repair.
B001TFE38A|5|I used this on my rims, the brake dust is real easy to get off and the wheels seem to stay cleaner. I used this on the paint and this gives a great shine, is easy to apply and remove. I followed this up with the butter wax and it is like the dirt just falls off the car.
B00M1Y3KZA|5|Great product and price.
B009AFFYR0|5|2015 GMC Acadia
B000765MHI|5|Amazing fan. 5 stars if it stands the test of time.
B0002UEN1A|1|sent back didnt need it
B00F9LPJ8S|1|So it all seemed fine. Installation was a snap and everything worked fine. Then one day, my bike died while idling at a red light. I had been riding for more than 1/2 hour at street speeds so there was no reason for the engine to die, electrical was totally dead and would not even kick start. I had the bike towed to the mechanic who determined that the battery was dead, replaced it, checked the electrical systems including the alternator and everything was fine. No problems since with new, OEM battery. So I put the Battery Tender battery on the lithium charger and it fully charges and holds it charge, but it won't charge sufficiently while driving the motorcycle... makes no sense.
B000IYT158|5|I am satisfied with the item
B009DJX7TA|3|Arrived bent, was not a perfect fit but on the bright side it worked and solved my problem
B00NF1Q2XA|5|Exactly what I needed. Got the spare tire out of the way and in it's place. Still holding with not issues.
B00CP6IA3Q|5|Received part in about a week.  Installed per youtube video instructions - no real instructions come with the part.  Took less than half hour to remove door panel, old part, and install new part.  No special tools needed (had Torx bits).  So far still working good.  Very satisfied.
B000GZPGCQ|2|The gauge did not work
B0006IX87S|5|Used for the first time.  Like the style and function
B00MYF7ZZC|5|Great trash can for the car...sits just right. Thank you.
B005DCKRP8|5|I love it. Everything I envisioned it to be
B000BPSVWI|5|I now have a very clean radiator no sludge at all !<br />Works great
B00T57WUCK|5|It was  just fine
B0012TYYRI|5|Great product
B0000AY69N|4|Great product, provided the water proofing on my boat cover that had worn off over several years of use. Received promptly, but one of the plastic bottles was leaking in the shipping container.
B00JVWDWPS|2|The product arrived and one of the eyelets was missing!  I needed the product to badly at that time to protect my special needs son from the sun for a trip so I just kept the thing; when it breaks, AND IT WILL, I will buy a better made product!
B0096S9IDM|4|What do you say about a key fob? It works! The instructions were a little hard to understand for a woman with no mechanical experience. fast shipping
B0052FRX9E|5|Arrived quickly and was easy to install.  Works great.
B004PL4H0O|5|bought these for a shop dog (saw horse) that i built. They work great!
B0013916XW|5|I recommend everyone with a Jeep get these.
B007VCOF42|5|If you put up and take down a sunscreen a couple of times a day, I would highly recommend this product.<br />In my opinion, the $50 is well worth it compared to the daily frustration of putting up and taking down a lesser quality sunscreen that doesn't really fit your windshield.<br />The screen fit my windshield well and looks very clean when installed.
B004QWPFYY|5|works great
B001DN1L6K|5|This antenna was well worth the money. I mounted it without a problem on the rear window of my Impala. There was plenty of cord to run under the carpet and up through the front seat where my Uniden Scanner is mounted on my dashboard. Amplifies my scanners range and nearby frequencies come in crisp. I'm considering buying another for my other vehicle. You can't go wrong for the price!
B00B0DGRF8|5|This sunglasses fit me perfectly on my head and nose (which is not very small at all), I usually use them to ride my bike and they keep the wind away from my eyes without a problem. I absolutely recommend this product.
B000OGAA1E|5|Works great on my Z4.
B0033YD0CA|5|good
B004QHMXKI|5|This is a great set of lug nuts with open design for long wheel studs.  My car has only 16 lugs, and I use one for a locking lug nut, so I only need 12 of the 20 supplied, BUT, will have the extras to use when/if some get stolen!
B006N932BG|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B000GTOPR4|5|Very flexable and great length for usage.
B000CJD48O|5|This one fits the Oldsmobile Silhouette 1997 minivan. It takes mere 1-2 minutes to replace: better than some vehicles in which one has to take the glove compartment out to get to the filter door. Old filter collected tons of debris and was ugly
B0041QJY7Y|5|great
B004QC5C56|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00P91KLY0|5|Got these to cinch our kayaks down on our boat. We live in Key West, FL so everything rusts in a matter of 2-3 weeks. Not these! These are still going strong a year later! Ordered a second set thinking the first set would give out like our previous brands, but they're still in storage for just in case.
B00CUAWJ6G|5|They are great products but be careful how you store it, I ordered one and kept in the bag it came in after use and it was fused to the ziplock type bag it game it that made it unusable.
B002MQCYO0|5|I discovered Plexus on a car detailing site.  I have a 1998 BMW 328 convertible with the flexible plastic rear window.  Plexus is the ONLY product used on that plastic window.  It is 12 years old & I can still see through it. No other product cleans the windows as well & I tried every plastic cleaners & polish I could find before I found Plexus.<br />When I told Roth at Premier Tops in Sunnyvale, he decided to use it too.
B005EJGSQ2|3|Works great. In the winter when you go to turn your car on to defrost just remember to turn this on as well.
B010MNRE2G|1|Beautiful Tail Lights but If i Could Give It Negative Ratings I Would. The Wires Are Completely Wrong For My Truck and I Would Highly Recommend Not Purchasing This Product.
B0032J1KAK|5|Great product.
B00FG2MZXM|5|Oem, that's all you need to know!
B000BO8Z9I|5|Must have to remove minor scratches.
B000CPJI7O|5|works great.
B00DSGFXZ0|2|Everything looked okay but boots and clamps used are terrible!!
B004KSBUG6|2|I bought this too and was it wasn't the item pictured. Now I have a bag of junk plastic rings that nobody wants in my drawer.
B000C2W85Q|5|High quality components make this water pump look like one of the best aftermarket replacements for the Jeep 4.0L. It is built to meet or exceed OEM specifications.
B001NJ3H0C|5|This product did not disappoint, and nearly fully charged when received. I waited to write this review so as to give ample time for some problem to develop, but no issues have reared their ugly faces at all !
B008F8Q9IG|4|good fit. bright lights.
B00KTIAREM|1|Hi i program it and it did fine for 4 days and it want stay program, none of them.
B00RCBERJK|4|These look amazing on my 2012 camaro however they flicker out while I am driving, or do not come on, but when I use the turn signal, or my car is off or parked they work perfectly and every time. Not sure why they only work part time while I am driving, would like to have that fixed. Hmm.
B00AX47FLA|2|I instruct in Car club high speed driving events. It's required to wear a helmet so having a communicator is a must. I have used the generation one for a while and found the original plugs frustrating. They only went in one way and if you had your helmet on, plugging in was always nearly impossible. Eventually, the unit gave up the ghost so I bought Generation 2. The plugs are simple pin types so inserting while wearing the helmet is easier - note, I didn't say easy because the power hole can be a target - oops!<br /><br />Mine has been semi reliable - it cut out yesterday for no reason and then started to work - again for no reason. Sound quality has never been good either - scratchy and strained.<br /><br />Finally, the poorly designed helmet clip broke after two wearing shorts and I had to duct tape the box to my helmet. Just about all of the instructors (not an exaggeration) have the same issue. Most use Velcro to attach the box but one made a clip out of metal to keep it secure.<br /><br />This is $100 tool that should have better sound quality and much better build quality ...<br /><br />Not Recommended
B00IM2E7JI|5|good fuse works as expected.
B000BWDWIE|5|Exactly what I ordered, nice plugs.
B008OZG65Q|5|The best wheel stands in the business. None are perfect, but Pit Bull comes pretty close.
B00KHUQGGA|1|The noxious fumes coming off the materials were overpowering! I never installed the product. I can't say how well it fit or how comfortable it is. Sorry!
B005KDV9MK|2|Don't bother with this. I have not been able to match the color after many tries. The color just does not match.
B008HCV7VE|5|great product
B005JCSUJC|5|Good product and fast delivery
B009E93UW8|5|Very nice shackle, I like the grease able fitting.
B007TKJNEI|4|It took my brothers about 20 minutes to put this on. It seems like durable material. Itsurvived the rain this summer and I'm positive it will protect the vehicle from the snow as well!
B001EOYIZ4|5|Fits perfectly for my 2007 outlander
B000P6URMA|5|Stuff is great. Easy to work with and very durable.
B003888NGO|5|Prothane is excellent.  You might not imagine that your existing rubber parts could be improved.  Or that a new set of polyurethane bushings would make all that much difference.  Without going into the dynamics of weight and friction, and the forces imposed on suspension parts while accelerating, cornering, and braking, you just have to believe that the difference in feel and performance with Prothane bushings is amazing.  Once you install them and experience the improved handling, you'll wonder why manufacturers don't install them at the factory.  I still can't figure that one out.
B000FPYCPE|5|Excellent quality, perfect fit ( Jeep JK 2008), long-lasting, remarkable customer service. Highly recommended.
B00MQAEC9W|5|Just what I was looking for.
B008R53CTQ|5|Great lift. Front end is now level with the back
B000EQRZHG|5|well packed,fast shipping,part fit as it should.Be aware this part does not come with gaskets
B0060ZB044|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B00FFQWT6M|4|Arrived as expected
B0002U2V1Y|1|I have used many of your products for several years. Clay bars several time but I purchased fom local retailer. Maybe I got a bad batch of clay but the clay is falling apart after using it ONCE on ONE car. Maybe you have a new vendor or changed the formula but it is not the same. :-(!!!! Please advise as to what I should do.
B004OFNJZ0|5|My car is white so they look really nice... not tacky like those silver ones...<br />they look fancy !
B008ZPF4NU|5|Shipping was slow but worth the wait
B0068G18E2|5|Shocks changed my ride 100 percent. Highly recommended.
B00979OE5C|4|Not what i though they would look or feel like, overall still happy, a bit cheap on looks, but fit perfect, glad i went with large, almost might size a bit small. My hands are pretty big, but normally a large is not a perfect fit, again i cant complain but the looks a tad bit, you get what you pay for.
B003VGHBMA|5|fits perfect and looks great.
B00029JML2|5|Makes installation that much simpler.
B0002SQVDK|5|Sets for nice final wax
B005LD2GLW|4|Used to clean carburetor on Hedge Trimmer.  Seemed to work well, smell was not bad at all, kind of sweetish like a magic marker.
B001O0U064|5|What a difference over the old brakes
B00429NKWK|5|Kit works great however if you have some 600, 800 and 1500 grit wet dry paper you can do a far better job in less time. The kit jumps from 400 to 1000 grit and then to 2000 grit. These jumps are too big.  You either spend an inordinate amount of time using the 1000 and 2000 grit papers or leave some 400 grit scratches. For instance the 600 grit paper will quickly do a good job of removing the 400 grit scratches far faster and better than the 1000 grit paper. Same thing on the jump from 1500 to 2000 grit:  use the 1500 grit paper for better results. I also used Windex as a wetting agent and lubricant. It works so well that your paper hardly wears at all. I'm going to try using a buffer and compound to get a haze free surface before I apply the UV protectorate. As it is once the UV coating is gone you still have only a 2000 grit haze underneath. As new the surface is gloss and then coated. Why not do the same thing?<br /><br />The box offers a lifetime warranty only if you register. For iPhone/iPad users I suggest you bring up your Amazon order on your iPad and take a picture with your iPhone and then Air Print it back to your iPad. When you register it will ask for an image of the receipt.  Not a PDF. Do as suggested and things will go smoothly.
B00RV4E0JK|5|The paint got to me in a short amount of time and the finish product came out better than I though it would. I really enjoy spraying things with Plasti Dip and I would recommend it to anyone who is try to change their looks on anything you want (It comes right off if you don't like it, or get tired of the color).<br />I have painted my helmet, and I recently did my street bike.
B004QEH1QW|5|This will avoid your trailer scooting on its pole jack and ever so slightly bending (and rendering it immediately unfixable and leaving you stuck). If it slightly moves it slightly moves, that's it. It's not slippery, just a metal foot for the bottom of your pole jack
B0044AVL8W|5|Excellent Products
B0002F68FO|5|BEST DRUNK HANDLE EVER! Def recommend!!! Every RV should have one.
B0012RI71O|5|Yes plug in play.. So easy..
B0002UEOLO|5|Hope I never have to find out how good this stuff is!
B011KHEHWS|5|Great size. Great material that should last the test of time. Impressed with absorbency.
B00WRALWT4|5|Small minor issue with the idem (was shipped with the incorrect power cord ). I contacted them and they rushed me the correct one with a gift for the mistake.  100% as advertised and works great. I will be buying from them again.
B000CPJLGW|5|Works great. It is a true satin clear coat though. It will add some shine to you other VHT high temp paints (Which is what I used it for mostly), but if you want to polish and clear coat to prevent rust, you will get a satin shine and not a high gloss. I did this on an item....polished with buffer to a mirror shine then added the clear coat. It shines, but not like the mirror shine I had on it.
B007I6Z05Y|5|Fits my 2013 Wrangler almost perfectly and does its job well.
B002XM5G70|5|Replaced another brand that quit in my RV.  This one is quieter.
B00TA5ECJQ|5|When I saw the size of the bulb I thought &#34;Oh boy, this is going to take forever&#34;. In fact it siphons surprisingly fast with very little effort. It does what it's supposed to very well.
B00LDOO1J8|1|Very hard to program no instructions.
B003MR9BUI|5|The Camaro hat is of excellent quality and exceeded my expectations.
B0061J7X5Y|5|excelent
B001HJR9XE|5|Woeks good
B000BQR100|5|I am satisfied with the item
B00FQT3U1Q|1|this stuff messed up the screen to my Lexus navigation screen!!! I ought to write a letter to corporate so they can pay for it.
B005JZGNB6|5|Good Camry Kit
B0056JC2S8|5|Bought for husband's jeep, was easy to use. He's a happy camper!!! Fast shipping!!
B00LMRFJGK|5|Looks good on my husband's jeep, he's very happy with it too!!
B002ZBWKAU|4|Good,but Still require some improvement.
B009TC9I9E|5|Good quality tool.
B000PDK5MA|5|This alternator puts out a bunch of Amps. On my truck, I had trouble stopping the belt from squealing and installed an 8% underdrive pulley to cut down the slippage. Easy installation and electrical connection.
B002R0ASEE|5|4 screws and an old stuborn wire cable made a 5 minute swap out  on my '88 Chevy 1500 Silverado
B0002Q81W6|2|Okay product.  Did not come with the proper screws and the actual plug does not fit tight enough inside the bracket.  Still feels like I have to hold the back of the plug when I'm connecting my wire for my trailer.  Spend a little extra money and get the CURT 58001 Easy Mount Electrical Bracket and you will be much happier.
B004L7J9ZU|5|exactly what I order.no issue with fitment on 2015 explorer
B00HZX4OPM|3|cheap enough that its ok, but doesnt really brighten anything.
B000RFP468|5|so far, so good.
B003QIO0M2|5|Perfect for my helmet
B00JA1C3LE|5|great quality
B00KX35HTS|5|Awesome bright light, has survived 2 races on my sxs
B00AZPOO16|5|Good quality and I just love it.  This is the second one I have bought.  Still have my other one on a different car for about a year now and still looks great.  I had to get one for my new car as well! :)
B0117EESNC|2|Bought 1 set last year 2014, 16,000 lbs model. Mostly use to change oil on the sedan cars. I used on concrete surface, drove on slowly, no abuse. The crack was right on the bottom of where the tire stand on
B0013ERRSK|3|Because it is normally exposed to partial Sun ........ Plastic cap becomes brittle and it cracked .
B00P3GDDLE|1|Arrived damaged
B004YHR3JG|2|Haven't installed them yet, but they look absolutely nothing like the ones in the picture.
B00KTS6M78|4|Very easy to install. Working very well.
B007GT7IQW|5|Nice !
B00IXZQEFY|5|Another great product from Rugged Ridge.
B00HQYTTXC|5|Good thanks
B00DQ1RV70|1|I ordered these hub caps for my prius v and they are about an inch in dia to small. The post with the 57mm stated that it would fit 2010 prius v. Wrong!!!
B00652G4TS|5|Great investment, does as much as a expensive scanner form the big guys for only $100 which makes it ideal for guys who are still going to school like myself. Highly recommended for anyone from DIYers to professionals looking to avoid the pricey bill of big name scanners
B004AQVRKM|5|fit perfectly on my '93 OMC 40HP
B00VMMALKY|5|This looks super cute on my car!! A great gift for Marvel fans for sure
B00MJUQJSG|1|I need to send it back.
B001BNQQ8A|3|does a very good job, but it could fit a little bit better.
B00Z4RBR0G|5|Starting with the box which was nice, and the zip bag and everything else that came included was amazing. Its pretty solid, so it protects everything inside.<br /><br />You get the jump starter cables, a micro usb cable, a ton of different laptop adapters and a universal cable for them. You also get a car charger, a wall charger, and a ton of useful accessories.<br /><br />The charger it self is pretty awesome. It looks really cool and heavy duty but its extremely light in weight and small in size. You also have a flashlight so you can what you are doing in the dark, it also has a voltage indicator to show you how many volts it gives out. You can also charge a usb powered device, all of this in a small and compact case.<br /><br />Overall I love this Energette A38 ,its packed with features, and you can jump start your car. If you buy this you will not be disappointed and you will not need a boost to give your car power.<br />Sample provided in exchange for my unbiased review.
B00TYW7RS8|2|Part snapped with minimal pressure.
B00EKW1NEG|2|ridiculously small.  I was expecting something you could actually see on the wall
B00F52T7MK|5|Absolutely LOVE this cup holder.<br /><br />Worth the extra money to have a sturdy, well-made cup holder.
B0002BC06Y|3|Good mirror - but made in China. Come on Lisle, I was counting on you for a US made tool.
B00G5D9CAU|5|Its look very nice in the night  and easy to install Thank you
B00180FWEU|4|PART WAS AS ADVERTISED AND LESS THAN THE LOCAL PARTS STORES OFFERED.
B00WO8XNOG|1|It was cut wrong so it wouldn't fit
B004I9MD2M|3|Quality is so-so. Sticks to a properly prepped tank very well, but the resin needs to be cleaned very often. If a bug hits you and falls onto the pad it's guts (which are essentially a natural shellac compound) will eat through the resin. About a 1&#34; x 2&#34; portion of my tank pad looks melted because bug guts got on it during a 4 hour ride. Cleaned as soon as I got home but it was too late. It had already started to break down the domed surface of the pad.
B00VA0VUYY|4|Dimensions are incorrect.  If sofa mode the backrest leans back another 3-4&#34; meaning that the total depth is at least 31&#34; not 28&#34;.  Also the total width (or length) from end to end is a little more than 60&#34;, almost 61&#34;.  I may have to return it because of this and my tight space.  Also beware that mine arrived wide open (don't think it was ever closed as the couch didn't fit the box), a bit dirty, and some number of them going out this way will get permanently damaged.<br /><br />However, I won't factor any of that into my review for the product itself.  I am giving 4 stars because it is comfortable, soft material, and relatively easy to convert from bed to couch.  Overall I think it is very good.<br /><br />Weaknesses are that it isn't the sturdiest on the included legs, which arrived badly scratched and clearly used, you can contact and possibly even slightly hurt yourself on the mechanisms at the end, and the foam should be upgraded to something rated for low outgassing.<br /><br />As it is I think the price should be lower for what you get, or the materials upgraded to more health conscious ones at the same price.  But it is pretty nice as is.
B001U60T9U|2|It fit my front seats but not my back seats had to edit it a little bit looks nice but disappointed with the fact it said it would fit my 2012 dodge avenger.
B003V57NUQ|5|This J-Bar Rack is Awesome<br />My kayak perfect fit<br />I recommend it
B000CB7DG6|5|great fit
B00DZX31QY|3|Does the job quickly.
B00495UQT2|4|good replacement
B0016GRTVU|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B004D94RMQ|5|Awsome product
B007Z1UBOC|5|This alternator is the best. Apparently DB Electrical sells this alternator to SUB distribution companies that sells this alternator. The price varies from approximately $130 to $150. Also this is sold to Nissan Corp through Nissan Parts. I can't use this alternator now, however I will keep it for my back-up. This is a jewel. You won't find any better. And it's sold on Amazon.
B004I5T4Q4|5|Great Grill. Have had it on my truck for a few weeks now. Install was easy.
B005WXNHN2|5|Easy to install and perfect fit
B000XECJES|5|great
B001C5O9P4|4|Fits great wish the lens were a bit easier to swap out... may need to buy another pair for those night rides
B003FXLXKK|5|looks good on my beetle
B00SGACJF0|5|Along with my black grill, the f150 is looking real good As of jun 2017 front headlights starting to peel
B000EFMU4A|3|Worked ok
B000CMJ2N2|3|it is not the same as the original, the adaptor does not go over the lug nut remover like the original but it works ok
B003YI421I|5|Q-Bondnis the real thing!  We use it on a daily basis and it never fails to amaze us.
B0019ZLPLS|4|This is our 3rd cover. This time I am keeping track of the time we have it before it starts to rip apart. Nice to have, but does not last forever.
B004A09OAI|4|good quality great price
B00B2A2RR6|5|it is always good to have your back up ready ,if buy chance one of your beautiful light bulbs go out..dont want one minute to go by without my truck looking pristine.
B003UYYGTO|5|Perfect
B00N07IVVA|4|Well built, good looking product. A little pricey but overall worth it as an extra little bit of automotive &#34;jewelry&#34;.
B00WB01JMU|5|Very strong and easy to install. Perfect length for my Land Cruiser. Can't speak to their longevity yet, but it seems to be a quality product.  Much stronger than the last aftermarket pair of shocks I installed on the same model vehicle. Much more affordable the OEM.
B0031GWMLU|5|GOOD JOB, GREAT ITEM.....
B0041TR3BK|5|Great replacement for when I mistakenly backed into the garage and damaged mine beyond reasonable repair!  Lined up perfectly changed in around 10 minutes including removal of old broken cracked mirror.
B00XO6BW40|5|works perfect
B00F64N052|5|Couldn't be happier with these headliners. They help tremendously with the heat and the sound of the road.
B00AKXC54Q|5|High quality!
B00CLV8LTI|5|Trim worked great, you need a straight edge or a great pair of scissors to make a clean cut.
B002ZTNWTU|5|Love these.. fit great in my acadia. Had a,set with my last Traverse too. Definately a must in winter. Saved my interior and fits perfect.
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Great product !!!
B003YK5KHG|4|It works great!  It doesn't hide as nice as an OEM step, but it does the job no doubt about it!
B00KTIR1ZU|5|The original remotes were getting worn and didn't work all the time. I purchased two, went to a dealership and within an hour, they were programmed to the car.<br />Saved soooo much money !!!!
B004MS9VTW|5|Worked great to break my existing GSX-R 600 chain and rivot the new Vortex 520 chain. It was my first time attempting this, but instructions (between those included and those available on forums) were clear and easy to follow. Great kit for the money!
B00IB38YVA|5|looks great  excellent quality
B002OAV7XS|5|Perfect toolbag for my Victory Hammer
B007TY2IJG|5|very good after market replacement good fit and works well.
B003E7LUSM|4|Great product, installation has to be perfect, no second chances!
B00E8CV0EQ|4|smaller than I thought it would be which is good.  Hope I never have to use it.
B00UIRGMBQ|5|Thanks
B002VVIBE8|5|I think it actually makes my 82 Honda Magna look better, and blocks just enough wind to still enjoy SOME wind while you ride!  Very happy with it..
B00074Q29W|5|I bought these after a particularly bad experience towing last year in the wind between Az and Nv. This is a good product for a good price. I use two as I am pulling a 31' ultralight trailer with a Yukon. Easy to install on the trailer just have to make sure you have the &#34;tab&#34; for the small ball on the hitch, otherwise need a qualified person to weld a tab on the hitch to mount the ball. I found one. It cost me an additional $60 to complete the install. Just returned from a trip where I put 2700 miles on my Yukon, most of these miles were towing. Sway controls significantly reduced sway and increased control.
B00SHXFIAE|5|Quick shipping and a great product!
B001J8M82U|5|Love these floor mats
B003U80X1U|4|Great on tires, not so much on exterior plastic
B00FC221BC|2|buy this product had it for 3 months and the ballast is starting to go out and flickering.the product came in about 4 dayshave no problem with hooking it up it was pretty simple plug and play just hopefully the ballast doesn't go out when you buy one
B00BD4SJBO|5|They're what I expected and will keep our seats clean. We like the colors. Looks good on....
B00BTGSID0|5|Great for cleaning everything. They are big, absorbent and add a perfect polish, all with no chemicals.
B00MOGXSZ2|5|This is a great product for those in California. Looks great and is durable. Don't be fooled by the image, this is the VOC compliant version.
B0082365AQ|4|I don't know if there is a better design, this is the only dolly I have used.  First trip out we ended up just carrying our kayaks.  They kept slipping and the dolly would collapse.  Lots of large rocks.  When I brought home I attached the kayaks with strong rubber bungee cord. Worked a lot better.  Did the same on second trip and worked good.  This trip was over smooth dirt road.  Overall I own two and would buy again.<br />Side note,  The day they delivered I could smell them as soon as I got out of the car.  Felt sorry for the UPS driver, I'm sure his truck smelled the rest of the day. It took about a week for the smell to go away, unboxed and sitting outside
B007D5UZ96|5|worked great!
B00VT02ZEE|5|What an excellent deal.The price has come WAY down on these. Not quite the quality of a factory OEM part but at this price you can not beat them. Plenty of info on the internet on how to install these. This is my second set. I recommend them.
B004W8MQA8|5|Replaced my old converter with little modifications, works fine.
B007L79EXY|5|Good stuff, they look really nice. I would buy them again. I don't think anyone else makes a sticker like this for XJ's .
B00DCC9PSQ|5|Exelent
B00C1YI2XA|2|Are SUPER BRIGHT but the wire and soldering are so cheap!!
B0006JLU2C|5|This works very well on cars, too, if you don't feel like doing a whole wax job. It's good stuff. Brings out a nice little shine.
B000IDUW5C|5|good
B0032J1KAK|5|great
B001UC8WMA|5|My mechanic had to program it but work instantaneous.
B009DK7PEW|4|Is good for the price
B00017YYIG|5|the detailed installation guide, was so easy to follow, and at this stage the air lift 57215 loadlifter 5000 rear lift kit works great, time will tell once the 29foot fully enclosed race car trailer is hitched up to the dodge ram.. i'll keep you posted.....
B00CMU983Q|5|It was a awesome add on. Looks friggin great
B000AME50Y|1|it didn't do anything.
B00SISKFW4|5|Shipped fast great quality love it
B00JQKLKKO|5|It fits the mustang great.  The holder sits low to the ground as the bars and plate goes underneath the bottom bumper, so you may or may not like it.  I was just a bit surprised how low it fits.
B0010DY4J4|5|Exactly what I expected - ARB products are top-of-the-line.
B00UFERZKO|5|It works great, charges all my stuff great
B000GTTJKW|1|Didnt fit my 97 seadoo gtx
B0066QRCTO|2|Compared to the original antenna that came with my 2004 Corolla, this product is worse. My radio reception is worse. There is a lot more static. I don't recommend this product at all!
B00Q7P4V20|5|Shipped quickly and looks excellent
B004WLL0OI|5|Easy install. It is plug and play with the factory plug hidden under your dash on the left side.
B00802GIW4|3|My husband couldn't figure out how to put these on so we sent it back. Mechanic shops wanted to charge 89 an hour to put them on...
B009NTEYXS|5|Simple to install and a great price on Amazon
B00ELBCSZY|5|Really good. High recomendation. You money really worht.very resistent. Washable and looks great in my jeep
B007OW62V8|5|Great product
B008RITS78|4|Worked great, easy to install.  If you are having problems with this system then have a professional do the work.  I am not a mechanic and I completed the task quickly, bled the brakes out and it was good to go.
B008442KG6|5|Good
B00YJ08Y46|5|As described
B00AUL6QL6|5|Great price for a quality made product.
B00BV6UQTW|5|Works great on a 2004 Pontiac Grand Am SE2
B00IGCVJO0|1|Product Description: Price is for Total Quantity of 10 in each order.<br /><br />I received one clip . how rediculous.
B00KWVM6LS|5|Excellent for the price!
B00DO93SOY|5|This exhaust sounds good on my 2014 Mustang GT!
B001AXEURU|3|lining torn up pretty quick.
B00AOA2UB8|5|It's WeatherTech.
B002XL2IBS|5|Worked great! We couldn't believe that our water heater had so much debris after only a very few times using it. This made rinsing it out SO easy! I highly recommend using this to help extend the life of your RV water heater.
B00IGZQAZ0|5|If you have a Subaru USE THIS OEM PART!  Yes there is websites that tell you to use an oil filter, it will result in shifting issues and increased wear on the transaxle.  Do you self a favor, use the right part
B00CTE4NHQ|5|Great pads for the price!
B00EVFVP0E|5|Very satisfied
B00063XX5U|4|nice, thank you
B000HBNTX2|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00LNDSKJG|5|Installed easily and looks good in stainless steel.
B001KQB5MU|5|Worked great!
B005DF5XDQ|5|My seat belt always used to cut into my neck. This should pad alleviates that problem.
B000BM8RT8|5|Gave it five stars as it's built like a tank
B00JZRP6VC|1|i received this today putting it on, and while tightened it a little the weld that kept on the nut broke.. i was able to pull the other weld off with my HAND! with not even that much effort.. if i can somehow get this to fit on my truck, depending on how it sound will change my star rating. for now i am way passed disappointed. also the picture shows two welds on each side of the nut and the fastener mine only came with one weld on each.
B005ESZ058|3|already rusting
B00A9T28S4|5|This stuff works!
B004A6M9MM|5|Super fast delivery. It is not in yet, but it has a lifetime warranty so<br /> I am confident it will be just fine
B000SL4A84|2|Who makes a first aid kit without including any antibiotic ointment??
B009G5FZDC|4|Better than the other crap out there. Although I don't expect these to last more than a couple years.
B0048J1GY8|5|works perfectly
B002Z34VJ6|4|This digital caliper does what it is supposed to for a very good price. Is it the best quality? No. Is it truly carbon fiber? No. However, it is accurate to within +\- 0.01mm and is very easy to use. If you read this and the other reviews and see the comments of &#34;it isn't on zero right out of the box! Horrible!&#34; remember two things: 1. You are paying $7 and change for a digital caliper, and 2. There is a handy &#34;zero&#34; button on it which allows for you to determine where zero truly is on the tool! If you don't know why that needs to be there, don't buy a digital caliper.<br /><br />Worth the money.
B000C98EIY|1|I received the wrong rotor; it doesn't fit on the distributor shaft. I'm returning this item.
B012WN6GKA|5|Quick shipping, well packed, looks awesome! Can't wait to install it!
B00B42EQU8|3|They faded to fast and coat started chipping
B00BRHM8FA|4|It did exactly what it said it was going to do excellent product
B0002Z9QO4|1|It lasted our first 4 hour trip fine. The next trip it made it about 3 hours up to a campground. Coming back was a much different story. About 5 mins into driving one of the plastic &#34;latches&#34;, or whatever you call the things that you use to synch down the straps, snapped in half and this loosened the whole setup enough that the whole thing was ripped from the top of the car by the wind. I had to quickly pull over and we carried it back to the car. Lucky everything was pretty soft up there (sleeping bags, tent, etc.) so nothing broke. I was then able to loop the strap through where the latch was before and tie it tightly down. That was probably more secure then the original plastic latches, which I guess need to be metal. It made it 3 hours down to where we stayed the next. The next day I made sure everything was secure as possible and we drove about 3-4 hours at which point the whole thing was once again ripped from the top of the car and ended up on the highway, which other cars didn't appreciate.... Once again we pulled over and carried it back. This time though, a whole set of straps and section of the bag was ripped off so that was the end of that. We packed our stuff uncomfortably tightly into the car with us for the last few hours of the trip. Needless to say I won't be getting another one.
B00516T0NQ|5|This cover is very nice and easy to put on. It covers the whole car and keeps it very clean.
B001AXCSJ2|5|I have had nothing but compliments about these boots.  The size runs a little big but with boots I didn't mind.  They are extremely durable. I have had them now for quite some time and they are in great shape!  I am going to buy another pair just because I am afraid they won't be around by the time I finally need another pair.
B001TB6NX2|5|Beautiful and very well made.
B00VGHYQQU|4|This sticker is really cool. I love Harry Potter and was looking for a decal to put on my car. The sticker was a bit smaller than expected but still the sticker still looks quite nice on my back windshield.
B001BP6R1O|1|Not very good at all, take way to long to warm up when turned on. Would not recomend to anyone, very dangerous
B004QB5G62|5|Great gift for anyone that has a hitch! Looks soooo much better than the original version!
B00S198YQE|5|looks great, but do yourself the favor and remove the junk tape that comes with it. Just go to the parts store and get some emblem adhesive. Looks and fits like it was there from the factory.
B008G2WTA8|5|These replacements are a great deal and work great!
B003888J7M|5|Prothane is excellent.  You might not imagine that your existing rubber parts could be improved.  Or that a new set of polyurethane bushings would make all that much difference.  Without going into the dynamics of weight and friction, and the forces imposed on suspension parts while accelerating, cornering, and braking, you just have to believe that the difference in feel and performance with Prothane bushings is amazing.  Once you install them and experience the improved handling, you'll wonder why manufacturers don't install them at the factory.  I still can't figure that one out.
B006B7YDK4|5|Love the sound love the extra power! I'm not the handiest person when it comes to working on cars and while yes the directions say it should only take 30 min to install it took me 90 min but that's my own fault hahaha.... Instructions are as straight forward as can be
B008P0UPD4|5|Worked great!
B00A3FMFNC|5|Great bag and the latches work great.
B00X3ENPJ8|5|Fantastic product.  Buying another one so I can do quick tire rotations at the track without lugging along a full size jack.
B002V0ZPNO|5|good product
B00ELHTA72|5|Very good, long lasting oil
B006B29H64|5|Note that this rotor was a direct replacement for the clanging one on my BMW R1200CL.  The Amazon website does not show it that way, possibly because they are not aware how different the R1200C and R1200CL are.  It WILL NOT fit the R1200C.  You do have to put the ABS sensor ring onto it, but new screws are provided.  I ground off the old screws as they would not come out.  For further information check out www.chromeheads.org tech forums.  Best BMW website in the world.
B00130MSH4|5|fast delivery...good price
B000B8WDEW|5|Very sturdy would buy agin
B00KLKE1PY|5|Arrived on time as expected and worked great.
B002GTKAHQ|3|difficult to clamp, requires much force to get a little bite when mounting. disassemble it and grease bits, then install.  works well once in place.
B00K57U3XW|1|Very cheap tint not as purple as it seems
B00NJ903MY|3|Good to be seen instead of helping the driver to actually see better.<br />I'll wait until fog's season to test it and check if it is good for that.
B005XRQNF6|5|The lights fit, look, and work great.
B00KY8QGLA|5|Exactly as described. Great service.
B00HQSXKAG|5|perfect fit/great price
B005HMOSSG|5|I bought these hoping that I wouldn't wake up to a dead battery in our 2010 Honda Odyssey.  My kids are really bad about playing with the interior lights, even though they have been punished time and time again for doing it.  The LED lights were easy to install if you watch the Youtube video.  I saw several reviews that stated they didn't work.  If you install them one direction and they don't work, then you need to turn them around.<br /><br />They do provide quite a bit of light.  The one negative I have is the color of the light is harsh.  These are definitely not soft, warm light LEDs.  But if I don't wake up to a dead battery, then that is a small price to pay.
B00AHTD0LK|5|I was satisfied with the discs. The vibration I had before is gone.
B00L1EKGBM|5|Easy Installation. Fit 2014 Ram 1500
B00EA0ZB7I|1|Lights are bright but brackets are extremely weak. Company said they would start a warranty claim on the bracket but never did
B009LLZFMW|5|I play hard on my mountain bike, and its all rocks here, and Iwas taking a beating.  These shorts were just the ticket to save a few bruises.  They are padded like normal cycling shorts, so I just throw a regular set of baggy shorts over the top of them, and ride!  Planning to buy a second pair.  I only wish they came in bibs.
B000C39CL8|5|working great on my 1941 Lincoln with a 5.0HO engine abd an AOD trans....
B00JIIZCM6|5|Had some spots on my soft leather purse and looks like new again!
B00CGK0P4S|5|Fix great good quality
B006VJH60G|1|I don't know what append whi volant I use hi's products before no complaints In till now really por quality and fitment
B00TOURGD6|5|Very good replacement for the clutch pad on my 07 335i; I was hoping it would replace the brake pedal pad also but it's a different design FYI.
B0006JJ588|5|this is my 2nd kit I've bought due to buying another camper and it's a must have. I'll never leave it in a camper when I sell it again. This is a extremely easy way to winterize my rig
B00OPJFTOE|5|very nice plate cover for my new Indian
B00B2IEXYI|1|Tank looked great till the first time I used it and it leaked
B000WJBFBC|5|Great deal, quick shi
B00IWOZ4GQ|4|It is almost a perfect fit for 2003 honda accord v6. It was missing the notch where the hose meets the filter.<br />If someone is looking to match the oem the rubber is different and it is slightly thicker and softer . The spring that goes around the hose that meets the air fitter i had to stretch it a bit to make it fit perfectly. It does it job.
B00HTOB0NG|2|i dont hate it it just didn't work on my 2015 Chevrolet Silverado
B004I0GA02|2|The tail light required some filing to fit my Dodge Grand Caravan, even though it was shown as a direct replacement for my vehicle.
B000C9FK7W|4|it's hard to find a replacement motor that blows as hard as the factory motor. This one is the closest I've found. There's another one with a wire hanging out for the connection that's available and that one is pretty lousy.
B000NZSUSG|3|These taillights are fantastic. They look great and work great.  If you are stuck in epic traffic, put it in park once and a while.  The circuit board on the back got so hot it melted the plastic and smoked out the back of my truck.  They blew fuses and just about started my truck on fire.  Still like them so much im thinking of buying another pair.
B00EVMT6A8|5|No more blind spots, easy to install, looks and works really fine for the money.
B0091OE6K6|5|Works great!
B000F5HUUS|1|I was very disappointed.  The adaptors seemed to be of the best quality.  However, the pressure hose and gauge seemed to be very low quality.  The brass 'bushings' (where the hose mated with the gauge) appeared to be of very poor precision. The case has no molded receptacles for the individual adaptors and no molded receptacles for the gauge. I would not purchase this product again.
B001C4SL3G|2|All high-flow air filters allow more dust into the engine. Period.  They claim it will not void engine warranty, which implies it's a concern.  I purchased this a year ago, and am dumping it in exchange for OEM. Bottom line I think Honda knows their engine best. Why lose sleep over a killed engine just to save a few minutes every 15k?  K&N recommends cleaning filter every 50k, instead of 15k for OEM filters. Where do you think the dust has gone?
B009TTDIU2|5|Wow, quality from China, these fit my 1998 honda spirit like perfect, my bolts also threaded right in , they look bada$$, on my bike, shipping was kinda fast 11 days , I was told 20, so go figure , super happy .
B00LNNFQAC|4|I had 50W fog halogen lights and replaced them with these nice white looking LED's. Do not expect to get any usable light out of these for driving. They are just good to be seen and look cool. It's definitely not 1200 Lumens. How do I know? I have an LED flashlight with settings from 200, 700, 1800 and up to 4000 Lumuns and even at 700 Lumens it is much brighter than these these LED lights. That said, I sort of expected that already from the reviews and I still love the look of these in my b6 passat.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|I bought it and use it to put on my Mother's Life Line Alert Button. She had put her first one somewhere and we have yet to find it. When we got a replacement, I put one of these on it to locate it when she takes it off and forgets where she put it. I have had it for about a month and it is well worth getting. When she takes it off and puts it somewhere, I get the transmitter and find it. Well pleased with this item.
B00T7GYDTC|5|Great light bar so far.  Mounted on the front bumper of my Jeep Wrangler and it really puts out the light.  However, you have to be realistic as it is only a 12&#34; light.  Would highly recommend this light and this brand.
B00A6AS6LY|4|I've used this item a few times successfully and only once (on a front wheel drive Monte Carlo V-6) was not able to find an adapter that fit.
B000V58UMO|5|great
B0048FB912|5|Fits perfect and does its purpose which is to protect from the sun.
B007H2RR78|5|Perfect waste hosel for the RV
B004GCMVTG|5|Fits perfectly and the body shop guy had no complaints.  Great price that shop guy couldn't touch.
B00FALVU8A|5|Easy to use, dries fast, real easy to remove. Will not leave white residue on black trim. I used this after the Jetseal, really gives a nice slick finish to the paint.
B00R9VTG08|5|Excellent and classy and have not seen on anyone else car so far.
B00HPS59AQ|1|It doesn't perform as advertised by K&N- it's soaked in oil and potentially can clog the intake air sensor, otherwise makes 0 difference compared to OEM engine performance-wise. It's best to go with OEM as those are specifically engineered to go with your engine.
B00XDI2TZ0|4|Good quality, but does not fit 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD Duramax truck!
B003D2BY16|5|good deal  works fine and easy to use
B00BVPOC20|5|Quick fix!
B000C5HZ9W|5|Worked as it should. No more coolant leak.
B009S30W9O|4|Worked well and fit well once I figured out the spring it came off the handle.
B00V81XA9I|1|Did not fit my 1992 Mitsubishi Galant.
B00303EG7M|4|worked fine, some parts were missing I didn't need them but could have caused a problem. fast delivery with Prime.
B00JGP8I1S|5|doest work too well
B00KTIYXLU|5|Wow, what a great deal. These are an exact match to the factory key fobs for my daughters 2006 Mustang GT. They come with the electronics and batteries included, not just a shell like most fobs for this price. It took me less than 30 seconds to program both remotes to the car. The instructions are easy to understand and explain exactly what to do depending on your year and model vehicle. They arrived in exactly 2 days and the time it took me to open the box, read the instructions and program both remotes took about 3 minutes total. I'll purchase from this company again if they offer fobs for any of my other vehicles.
B000CIQZ5O|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B003GBJ3V2|5|Excellent and very easy to install or remove
B002UX6MB6|5|Awesome
B00B5YVZK4|3|The good: It looks really nice once I got it on. There are many vertical chrome kits around but not many horizontal. Once I got it on it looked really nice.<br />The bad: This is not a drop in replacement and requires some light drilling to mount onto your hood.  The screws were rather difficult to squeeze between the bars.<br />Would I recommend it? Only if you are comfortable drilling holes in your car, not exactly for a beginner.
B002DU3TTO|5|perfect length.  works fine
B002N5PO2Y|5|Works as it should.
B00DJSGXB0|5|Great deal on them and a great quality product.
B003Z9T33I|5|Great fit, super easy to put on, stays on solid even at 90 mph, great add on.
B000VU9CVC|4|Very Happy with installation and look, quality of product.
B000BZI4JI|5|Received the part quickly and installed them the next day,<br />I don't think my truck ever ran so smoothly.
B000BQKSPK|5|Great bungee ties. Received timely and very useful.
B00M9NBUZU|5|Repeat buyer.
B00HIE7QMG|1|The head came broken....
B008VONUXG|3|Wings fell of and blew away, then I just had a little worm on my antennae.  :(
B000F5JMEA|4|Pricey I would say, but goes the job. Use this for my Slayer Propel Kayak for greasing the Propel unit. Had no issues with it. Being variable is a nice option so I can use it on my bike if needed as well!
B005VXFBDW|3|The can came with a little spill. I opened the package, then a strong acetone smell escaped. Also, opening the cap was a major pain. I had to use pliers. I wore goggles in case some splashed in my eye.
B005N71PXG|5|LOVE IT
B001AVE8DI|5|works great
B008I7NLLW|5|This was amazingly simple and easy to install.  The product came, matches my other mirror, and works perfectly.  Thanks for this terrific product and great service.
B00XR36WVI|5|My favorite item
B000VKRQEM|5|Arrived fast and saved me $$.
B000BQSYLA|5|Amazed to see made in USA.
B00RB66KU0|5|Just as expected! Quick shipping!
B002EW5FWU|5|It really works! Spray on, with a minute, wash off. No scrubbing required. You will have to wash it off though or it will leave a cloudy residue on glass, plastic, chrome, and paint. Handled all of the bugs during our trip to West Texas and Western North Carolina (through Louisiana) very well.
B00GSAUHB8|1|It doesn't stay in place!!! I can't use it.
B0002NII3Q|5|Beautiful.
B0027AGK0U|5|Helped low end torqu alot
B004PFMJPK|5|fits great and gives protection to the DEF tank which it needs
B005OQYCKE|5|This is a great buy.  Just about everything you might need for your vehicle.  If I had a second car, I would buy this again.
B003UBLUP0|1|Straight up doesn't work
B001EOV3B6|5|Only one small negative, the bolts for the bumper were not the correct size.  There is another comment which tells you the correct ones.  That was very helpful.  I just snapped a picture of the comment took to parts store and they grabed them for me.  Very easy to install no need for me to have exstention or remove spare.  2011 Crew Cab Silvarado.
B00O6WPVXY|4|Very satisfied
B004GD5LL0|3|Cheap and overly flexible plastic material, way more flexible than stock.  Physical fitment was close, but required some trimming to fit correctly.  Required creating a few of my own mounting holes, as some of them did not line up correctly.
B004WO9LMI|5|Awesome
B0089UQ4HG|1|Received the Tow Bar Bracket very quickly but the box was torn open and the small components were all missing.  After 4 days we finally were able to get a return phone call from the Returns Clerk at PPL Motors and a replacement was delivered quickly and everything has worked out okay.  The product was over a year old, the box was dirty and dusty, but was replaced and the new parts are perfect.  So a 5 stars on the product, a one star on all the hassle.
B004KK553I|5|very nice... buying another for the front of my infiniti
B008KKN4EQ|5|These brakes fit perfect easy installation.
B00B3V2SE6|3|It makes rust dissolve some.  Still need to sand then put something like Rustoleum, to cover and prepare to paint.
B00GI7897A|5|Perfect replacement for the OEM bulbs.  Very bright and better for tail light use.
B00MZUT71G|5|Worked just like expected. Arrived on time.
B00G49DURG|4|Very good!
B0083SL82A|1|Don't work with my 05 fz6 I had to replace the tube with a thin one. Fast delivery but it's worthless I didn't like it. My bike is 7/8 and again it wouldn't fit.
B004ZJBKFG|5|one of the best things i ever got for my boat well made and fit like a glove
B00Z709KKY|5|These work great and do not come off everything is great
B00K69YXS0|1|This cupholder is terrible, it is flimsy and falls out the window when going around corners  spelling Pepsi all over my brand-new car.  I threw in the trash where it belongs!
B00KTNO1WQ|5|muy bueno
B00K5A9GE6|5|It worked
B0054RYEBA|5|Order was timely and produce was great
B00QTIAPQG|1|I went by measurements and it still did not fit! Way too small. I guess I have to buy one from an actual Jeep dealer.
B00F5MU9MW|5|Wonderful shower head. Works as advertised except does not 'oxygenate' the water. It just mixes ambient air with it and produces what feels like a stronger shower. It would be more accurate to say it nitrogenates the water.
B00SGGWGRU|1|Not acurate
B00MB0F7EG|1|these were very poor quality and fell apart after only 2 1/2 weeks. I tossed them in the trash. Money not well spent.
B009AQS41M|5|So cute
B001FIDNGO|4|Works as advertised - recommend a pair of pliers to squeeze halves together and crush down the sharp point when first installed.
B008WH9ZA4|4|Easy to install, low dust, great stopping power!
B006LJALHQ|5|Very satisfied!!
B010TZ8XCC|5|GREAT!!!
B0012ETPUE|5|They only last 12 months.  That is one year.  So be prepared on the eleventh month to order your next pair.  That way you are prepare for when they burn out.
B00J4XD4U2|5|Instructions included with colored pictures, no need for alignment after application, made my truck look so much better. I would buy this product again.
B00QG96GK2|5|The all black helmet looks great, is lightweight, and the flip down sun visor is great for leaving during the day and coming home at night. The face air intake has a simple foam screen to guard from bugs from getting in. It comes with a clear shield unlike what is shown. You can find a dark shield for sale on Amazon later if you want.
B004HNT4WQ|5|Works as advertised.
B0047DEVRE|1|Had this installed on my navigator and after 2 weeks had to have new rear shocks installed. Both shocks broke in half, mechanic said they were not heavy duty enough for the vehicle.
B00865UGOG|5|Perfect fit, thanks
B00HNYRTU0|5|Exactly what I was looking for, high quality 3m product, not outrageous pricing like brick and mortar stores. As always fast prime shipping.
B000JZYTOE|1|did not bolt up. had to make numerous modifications and adjustments!
B001OKBINI|5|Shipped fast and good price.  Pleased with purchase and convenience.
B00A4MWSZ4|5|It work great
B000MD4YKM|1|Product stopped working after a couple of days. Want to give it zero stars but it is not possible on amazon. It was more expensive than similar products.
B007L2JNT4|4|They work as expected.  I painted them to match the color of truck, and people think they're original equipment. They're easy to play install.
B008JEEZRS|5|I have had multiple arm injuries, and decided to take the plunge and get a set of these to try out for my mountain biking.  Let me say this, these things work great!  Fit is tight, and they don't slip around.  Hard covers on the elbows and internal padding are excellent.  I have banged pretty hard, and these things can take a beating and save your arms from some real damage.  I won't ride without them anymore!  Really nice.  I do wish they made an XL size, as the Large fits tight but perfect with short sleeve jersey.  Come winter, I don't think they will fit over a long sleeve jersey.
B00S5E7C8Q|4|Works great!!
B00BTGSID0|5|Super soft and will not scratch. These are great for wiping up after using the clay bar, or getting into small spaces.
B00LST3022|4|The Wiring diagram was wrong. I used the green pop&lock wire to the blue/sliver Toyota wire and the other blue pop&lock wire to the white/silver Toyota wire. I also came into the truck's cabin from underneath, rather than the firewall. Its a much easier and neater way to install it. I went down the passenger side of the truck. It is a little loud when it locks and unlocks, but it's not to bad. Other then that it was an easy install and fit perfectly on my 2014 Toyota Tundra 4X4 platinum!
B010JRJYFK|3|The Mugen Style has a beautiful sport finish, it is very sturdy and easy to put in the place.<br />My Honda really looks very sporty with that.<br />The reason that I gave 3 Stars is because the product is not smoke but solid  black color instead<br />and that dangerously increase the blind spot on the front doors.
B00652G4TS|5|This is just awesome. If they could give you diagrams on stuff that would be great. That would be something i would purchase as I go.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Awesome!
B004ZF3A94|5|These lights are awesome. They are brighter than the HID headlights I had before these and installation was easy. Had an issue so I emailed customer service and they answered right away and resolved the issue. (Issue ended up being my truck not their product)
B0009H5298|1|Does not fit the 1999 Ford Ranger Flex Fuel.
B00GSAUHB8|2|Worked well for about a week until the wiring started coming out of it to the point that I had to stop using it because I was afraid I would end up poking my eye out.
B000C57K9M|5|Great price on these struts. Solved the rough ride issue in my Impala.
B0081KM6Q2|5|Very nice for night only
B000CDADGG|4|I had previously purchased a set of these wipers for my 2001 Pathfinder and was very satisfied with the performance.  When it came time to buy new wipers for my Toyota Sienna, i decided to go back to Valeo instead of paying more for the Toyota brand wipers.  I did read in some reviews about complains for chatter and noise for the larger version of these wipers.  It took a few weeks but when it finally rained while i was driving on the highway I had the opportunity to test the wipers.  And I can tell you that there is definitely no chatter on the wipers, none whatsoever and water removal is great, clean and crisp with no streaks. There is one issue though, there is an annoying squeak on the driver side (28&#34; blade) right when the wiper stops and changes direction.  At low speeds there is no squeak, but once you approach 55+, the sound becomes noticeable.  Since this is only on the driver side and not on the smaller passenger (20&#34; blade) side, I can definitely agree with previous reviews about subtle differences with the larger wiper blades.  Five stars for the 20&#34; blade and Four stars for the larger 28&#34; blade.  Update: 10/3/15 I lowered it to 4 stars after realizing that it was not the speed that caused the squeaking but the volume of rain.  In heavy rain, the squeak is very noticeable and rather annoying.
B00GSAUHB8|2|I tried using this on a 2008 Toyota Prius. Maybe the extra-large size would have fit better, but I found it difficult to prevent it from falling down, which is of course very frustrating.
B00WKK48BU|5|Awesome item.looks great on my 2015 toyota tundra
B0042HHSZW|5|Great value.
B008ZI66NY|4|cool
B005ZHRNOE|5|Keeps my car noticeably cooler.
B006M7E4IY|5|LOVE IT BUT SENDING UNIT DON'T FIT
B007BIUKLI|5|As described and arrived quicker then I though. Good item to power mu sirus radion
B000WGE3UA|2|I bought this kit instead of the Helicoil kit because of the price difference. First kit was missing the insertion tool. Amazon did a fine job getting a replacement to me right away. I don't like the prewinder in this kit. I found it very hard to use and in the end I had to order the helicoil kit anyway. It's prewinder/installation tool was much easier too use.
B00QW3HIVI|4|It was ok .
B00EN081FE|5|I had a squealing blower in a 2007 Audi Q7 that would squeal. Fits perfectly and an easy removal/install. The local Audi dealer quoted me $378 for the part and an hour of their time to install (total of about $500). This is way cheaper and works just as good.
B005GXNQHK|5|EXECELENTE
B00TKON4PA|1|Bought this for my 98 accord and it didn't fit so i bought a nrg hub n put the Quick release On it and the steering wheel felt like it was going to fall off. So the quick release is s***ty........   1 star
B005MZD0NM|5|Best product for your primary period!
B0031B1YWI|5|Fits perfectly. Save some money. Go to youtube for installation.
B009NMYD18|4|Let me start out by saying I was extremely pleased with the level of customer service shown by this vendor to resolve some issues that I experienced as part of my purchase and installation.  Typically, less than 12 hours to respond to any emails I forwarded to them.<br /><br />Product is generally what you would expect for the price and China made product.  I was pleased to see these headlights loaded with halogen lamps in addition to being provided with the HID lights that were ordered.  No instructions in my kit, but seller was able to forward them within hours of my email.  Had a  ballast that failed after about 20 minutes of operation.  Seller made it very easy to obtain a replacement part at no cost.  Headlamps look very nice in the HIDs seem very bright.  Installation was fairly straightforward.  A note of caution on the headlamps.  Be very careful with removal and installation of retaining clip screws.  The housing is plastic and the screws easily strip.  Use caution when removing and re-installing.  Overall, a decent value for the money.  A++++ support from the vendor.  Would be a five star if there were no issues with stripped screw holes or bad ballast. Great customer service helps offset those issues.
B000BGM7QS|5|My new toilet came with this but it good to have an extra on hand
B005PZMKZI|2|back seat of my pilot has 3 (three) head rest..  This only come with 2 for the back seat.
B000BYEOHK|5|Have used these many times before and they seem to stay cleaner and burn fuel better with more power.
B000SL4AA2|5|This Aaa has helped me many times when there aren't any gas stations around and my tire needs air, I have an suv it works great.
B00LEBLI82|5|Nice bright white light
B00V30J86I|5|This product is good to keep my bag from falling while driving and it also makes my bag nearer to me for easy access.<br />The compartment is good for keeping drugs, bottles, mails and newspapers.
B00L841M36|5|Works great easy fit no issues
B002UCAFXI|5|did a great job on moldy boat seats. not perfect, but better than anything else I've used, and I don't have to worry about it eating through the stitching or weakening/drying the vinyl.
B00JF5HR7K|5|Exactly what we wanted. Can't wait to try it out. Road trip!
B000IY42BG|5|Works as intended
B000E9C21M|5|Nice tint. Good quality. Highly recommend.
B007Y863F2|5|It works as it should. Quick delivery.
B006GFBLTC|4|Thought it would have fractals in them to give it a little more dimension, but it's just a flat colored reflection. Still looks good though.
B010X1POD8|5|It fit and works! What more could you ask for. Got my part very quickly too!
B00JN0U4SQ|2|Look good but horrible signal
B009F4JHHO|3|Cannot connect with iphone
B00IJT10PI|5|Best value for money, I'm 5' 11&#34; 185lbs and large fits great, no complaints
B0068M32WM|5|Work great on my audi a4.  Much cheaper than dealer
B008ZCHYZY|5|Works great! Installed on my 2005 Nissan Xterra. Took about and hour the first time I did this and once I knew the process it only took about 30 minutes the next time. Search Google for instructions to install. I found a great PDF with photos that I took out to the car with me and it was very easy. It works faster and better than all the original Nissan window motors. NOTE: this is a GREAT deal if you're willing to do the work. I called several mechanic shops and they all charged at least $400.
B0022ZHTG4|5|Been a supporter of this company for many years and would recommend them to all. Always soft and they are very reliable.
B00DOE0Y1E|5|What can I say??? It's a small rubber squeegee..So small i wanted to return it but it was super cheap... I use another soft sanding block as the squeegee instead...<br /><br />I can't give it anything under a 5 because it does what it says it does, just wish I would've payed attention on the size of it...
B007L8X1X2|5|Good price and fast shipping!
B004VG0N38|4|I almost use these pads exclusively but i've had problems with the backing melting after the very first use on a light polish and the fibers falling out...So I've found that these pads can be a hit or a miss...<br /><br />For correction ability they are great and it is my goto pad.. I just purchased a Flex 3401 and about to try the 5&#34; Hybird pads...
B005C577LI|1|Picture posted shows prop and insert. It DOES NOT come with inset
B00M3FS38Q|5|Love them
B000C19DL4|5|I almost never write product reviews however the &#34;pop lock&#34; was so simple to install and works really well I wanted to give it 5 stars. I was concerned that it would look cheap but not at all, it looks like it was installed by a professional. Worth every penny.
B00IUV7YNW|1|The battery didn't fit the VTX1800 even though the description said that it would.  After modifying and drilling out the holes for the larger VTX connection bolts, the battery went from 100% to 0% with the first attempt to start the bike.  It would not hold charge after.  Amazon is great.... Full refund was provided!
B000F14B7C|4|very good fit and color match interior color, I would get another
B00YE5Q132|5|OMG this battery charger is the best thing going!  I started to try it and my dad came and decided that if I didn't want to keep it in my car - he was taking it.  Not only is it perfect for the big items like your car, lawn mower and boat motors but it has the usb and can charge the cell, the laptop and yes, my dad's vapor cigs too!  Good Lord - can't ask for a better gift for the guy in the family or the needed car accessory for the girls (and they don't even know they need it yet)!<br /><br />Again - great item, heavy weight, durable and charges just about anything you need in the car or at home.
B000H6MNRU|4|i would buy this again. it did a nice job.
B00HV14RHI|4|Looks decent and matches enough to not be ugly. Obviously not a Toyota cap, but looks so much better than without.
B004W901CC|5|Sitter som gjutet. Bra köp
B00N9XVP9U|5|Awesome device! Powerful! Holds charge extremely well! Very easy to use! A must have.
B00KR4JG72|5|I bought this to pull a big dent out of the rear quarter panel  of my  Sienna van. It worked perfectly. Saved myself a couple hundred dollars in paintless dent removal.
B00VNBDWPK|5|I have such a hard time seeing at night and especially in the rain ( night or day) . These headlights let you see so much more and I no longer ask my husband to drive if it is raining or dark out! I highly recommend.
B00COCO7IS|5|exact fit, fast shipping, very satisfied
B00T5G53ZM|4|Works great for my 2006 Dodge Durango, and my 1999 Camaro. I have used Torque and Caroo apps with it, no problems. It would be nice to have better instructions, but honestly, if you can't figure it out, you won't be able to use the information provided either.
B00SNPF4DW|5|love it!
B0072PIJM2|5|Very pleased and lot cheaper than the auto part store
B003EOVLRA|4|They didn't fit as custom as I had another set when I first purchased the truck, they are of great quality and do fit nicely.  I would purchase this brand again in the future.
B00AN5S5BI|5|I put the brakes in without any issues , came with all the parts needed and extre shims . Brakes are quite and smooth , I'm very happy with them
B005ZFB7QQ|5|Everything was as it should have been. Also was a very good price .
B00801RHCU|5|Got it as seller promised and this is a GREAT deal, now my 1995 camry drives like brand new!!!!
B0033QNZZ0|5|Great product! I put it in a soda bottle with half water and keep it in my car in case it runs low. It used to leak a little, but for some reason after pouring this in, it doesn't leak at all pretty much! Great product! I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 1999 and this definitely helps in keeping it run smoothly.
B00062ZG5Q|4|fit good, 66 Ford F-100
B004P09Y12|5|Good job
B00EC0Z1GM|4|Good fit .Great price
B009VOQ05U|4|These racks are very sturdy.  As others have said the finish has a little to be desired and can chip, scratch and rust pretty easily.  However, for the price these are great.  After all they are ladder racks and meant to get a little banged up.  Used them on a trip to Maine to haul gear and absolutely no complaints.  The only minor drawback is the finish.  Oh well.
B004A0RBSK|2|Very tight fit on 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Difficult to latch clips on air filter housing. Don't have this issue with OEM filter.
B00IOUJ72U|5|Made a  huge difference. love it.
B0019ICENI|5|GLAD I ORDERED THIS WITH MY EXHAUST
B00YLZ7C3S|1|Useless.
B0009IK80A|1|Box was so smashed up it looked like they took it out of trash and put a generic O2 sensor in it.. I'm not sure they didn't.
B002V94Y0U|5|Perfect
B00BLQ2NJI|5|Perfect
B002MZWBIK|5|Although I have not used the roof rack yet, I have unpacked it and inspected it. Looks better made than many other rack s I've had in the past.<br /><br />When I ordered the item I didn't know it came in black as well as silver, however the seller called to ask which colour I would like the same day as the order and I chose black. He was both courteous and helpful. I would feel comfortable buying from the seller again.
B00RJUZY9Q|5|very nice and does the job well. Quality seems good, seems like its built to last.
B0073MF9DQ|5|the only issue I have with the Radiator is that the radiator is the best looking thing under the hood!
B00HZX1NTM|5|works great to keep hot sun off the vinyl of the armrest
B00B1F0INW|5|Nice net
B003WOGVU4|5|works as it should
B00UBD57EU|3|Hole where pin slides through to secure headlight, had to be drilled larger.
B00AFV7DI6|4|The mirrors fit perfectly except for having to trim a little off ( very little ) for the power folding mirrors as others noted. Well made, easy to install and remove.
B005UGK6HG|3|missing 3 clamps
B000BZJDK2|5|Fixed my broken fuel gauge and hot starting problems.  I followed the vent removal instructions found on the internet to increase my capacity from 14 to 19 gallons, and this worked perfectly alongside that mod.  What was unexpected was that this also has a little filter on the bottom that the factory sender did not.  I guess its just better quality than the original.
B006ZAPDH4|5|Made it to Sturgis and back without a hiccup.  Great for my I-phone unfortunately I can only see the screen in the evening hours. I guess we can call that a benefit since my eyes should be glued to the road
B0002UEPVI|5|Great stuff but does not dry perfectly clear.
B000C2UD4O|5|Looks good
B00OI0O1D0|5|Love my Karma sticker!
B007WR25FC|1|I absolutely do NOT recommend this bag. Details below.<br /><br />Worst bag. Ever. The bag had a lot of promise for $53! The bag seemed to be high quality with a thick outside, nice sturdy zippers, and a few great reviews, however, I must have received a dud or I was punked.<br /><br />I used this bag for a two day trip from Baltimore to New Orleans with mild scattered thunderstorms. As you can see in the photos, the interior liner of the bag, that makes it waterproof, completely deteriorated which allowed copious amounts of water into my belongings. In addition to the liner deteriorating, holes were formed in the bag...holes that I could fit my fists through.<br /><br />Thanks to this bag I had wet clothes, ruined books, and a few damaged electronics. I thought spending $53 on a bag would get me a quality bag. I guess I was wrong.<br /><br />NOTE: I bought this exact bag from a very reputable site that specializes in hitches and auto-cargo accessories.<br /><br />TIP: Anyone who has this bag, be sure to bind the zip pulls together by intertwining the pulls -- this will ensure the bag will not open because of the wind causing the bag to flap and slowly pry open the bag.
B00820NN86|5|Yes it did thanks
B000GBD2V2|5|Good buy-easy installation
B00VU8NJZO|5|The radiator fit perfectly installation was a breeze no problems encountered. I am more than pleased
B000W0WSPI|5|Good tool
B00W82EF0E|5|I don't only use the Energette D24 just for breakdowns and emergency use. I use it all year-round for camping. The dual USB Outputs (5V/2.1A & 5V/1A) can power a laptop or electric blanket for short periods and provides a handy power source via the USBs. It's a good product to have on standby for emergency battery failures - but remember to charge it before and after each use and every month to keep it on standby in top condition.<br /><br />Cant yet comment on the performance of the starter as not needed it as yet, but other reviews on here seem promising, hope this helps. Once I get a chance to use the jump starter (Although I'm not looking forward to it), I would be more than happy to give an update.<br />Product received in exchange for an honest review.
B000C57KMY|5|Perfect fit on 1975 custom 2 wheel drive w/460. Truck is also lowered. Rides like its brand new.
B00CEX5C9K|5|tool for my husband .he uses it at work. he loves it.
B009PIKHYW|5|Fit my 2013 ford escape SE model with no problems.  The teeth underneath really grip the carpet and make it stiff and immobile when the feet are on top of it. I chose these over weather tech because it was a little bit cheaper and the warranty was life time, which cannot be beat.  These will easily protect the carpet and keep the value up than without the floor beaters installed.
B00VS86JNU|1|Poor quality.
B00LDNGZ02|5|Good product took to long for delivery 3 weeks from California  to Georgia. Other that love it plain on ordering more.
B004I8SCOQ|5|Great service, excellent fit, look great and improved illumination.
B001UC8WMA|5|Very good.
B00BTFDW14|5|Bought it primarily for the R12 side and it worked perfectly.  But now I have an R34 set also for my more current autos.  Great price and quality for the occasional user.
B0080JF6AC|4|Order received in a timely manner. Color looks awesome. My only complaint is the actual bulb doesn't fit the fog light housing as well as others I have installed and it took a lot more effort and time to get the parts to align properly. These were installed on a 2007 SR5 tacoma.
B000MSBU9U|5|A+
B000V528JU|3|I'm disappointed in the consistency of these. I bought two and one of them was missing a washer and had a different type of lock nut. So I sent it back for a new one and it was also missing a washer. So I just gave up and bought a new washer from the hardware store. They're easy to install and much stronger than the original ones on my 2002 Tundra SR5 that rusted out. The price was good but now worth the trouble of not having all the parts there.
B003VDX5D2|5|This thing is AWESOME!  I just bought a Ford F150 and I'm an overweight, 5'3&#34; woman of 60 with marginal agility so climbing in the bed of the truck took prayer, advantageous topography and a cherry picker basically.  With this I just take it down and climb on up.  I can also climb on down facing forward if I'm careful.  I didn't install it, a friend did that for me but it was very simple and done within an hour with a few tools. I've used it a couple times already and it's so great I want to suggest that truck manufacturers make this standard equipment!
B0007VHSRU|5|Great product!
B00VNBDWPK|5|Wow, what a difference. These give much more usable light than the stock halogen lights. I have a 2009 Chevrolet Silverado and they give a great light pattern and definitely light up the road well. A bonus is they light up the street signs, road strips and anything with reflective properties really well. The install is plug and play, it took longer to get access to the lamps than it did to put them in. My suggestion would be to look on U-tube for an instructional video how to change the lamps on your vehicle. Now I need to get some for my 2005 Mini.
B000FT1GV8|5|Got these to hang my shade sails over the pool.  Work great!
B00CMX20H4|4|not crazy loud as i hoped but still a lot louder than the stock horns on my jeep JK
B000IG5PZQ|5|Have in my bathroom and woks great even with steam
B001A52T80|1|This orifice tube was too long to fit my 2000 Silverado. Amazon says it is the right part but it is obviously not.
B007MBAE74|3|the paint is good, however I paid extra for a fine tipped brush and didn't get it.
B00D4BDYUU|5|Everything except a clay bar kit!! Need to add that in for the price.. Each component has been excellent on my dark car.
B004I32O5Y|5|Fit and Finish was great.
B007PJ92SU|5|Works great in my jeep Cherokee with an 8.8 swap. Only time I hear it ratchet is driving slow around sharp turns
B007K22FVS|4|Would have gave it 5 stars but all the stirofoam  got into the inside of the light housing. Suggestions. Do not use stirofoam! !!!!
B000C9R2IW|1|Old stock, came in dusty box that was sitting on someones shelf a long time that couldn't be sold. Waste
B000C2DVHA|5|Worked great
B001G5VQLA|4|Great replacement. Easy to install
B00E6A69NM|5|Very satisfied
B00HUKDFGY|5|High quality MetaL emblems.
B00CASDZKC|5|Delivered on time. Great product. Fit our SUV perfectly :)
B00WGX3TD4|1|Not a good product. Ripped while I was putting it on.
B007HS15G6|5|Very well built exhaust tube. Thick walled. It is too bad I only needed 3&#34; of the 12&#34; length
B000JKK2MM|3|Overall I like this rack and would buy it again but don't expect an easy bolt on project.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The rack once it gets installed on your jeep will likely last an eternity. it is of a very thick durable pipe construction.<br />-It looks nice over all.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Difficult to install and required several modifications to fit on the Jeep. The rear mounts don't line up to the stock bumper bolts so you will have to drill new ones. part of a flange on the frame has to be ground down in order to make the rear mounts sit flush against the frame. The front mounts don't fit  squarely to the top mount. When I installed it the tube kept acting like it was twisted or bent but on further examination its because the mount hasn't been canted slightly to align with the fender. This can be mitigated a little by loosening all mounting bolts and slowly tightening the front ones then the rear.<br />-About 1/4 of the hardware to install this was the wrong size, while some of it could be improvised to work, I had to purchase some bolts from home depot to finish up the install.<br />-The quick release knobs are of poor construction and the nut breaks loose from the plastic very easily. I plan to remedy this by permanently bolting the cross rails in place.
B004EIBY36|4|I've had this for about 6 months now. Bought it locally because my power went out and the sump pump wasn't working. I had to hook a sump pump up to it (plus to a marine battery I bought in plans for a solar project later). It worked beautifully. My basement didn't flood. It only had to run the sump pump a few times and it gave a sound warning each time at first, but as it started pumping the water it went away after a few seconds. I think sump pumps use a lot of current at start.<br /><br />Now, months later, I have it hooked up to a solar array and it runs lights for me. Planning on getting something a little more substantial, but at the time this was perfect. Didn't have any issues. I'll keep it in the house for any other emergencies.
B00DIGXF32|5|Worked out as intended
B009MALLDY|5|Fantastic product, , just wish it was offered in stainless steal, or powder coated metal. .
B006B2V35W|5|Arrived way quick. Went on in under 30 minutes. One of the best investments I have made. Major bang for buck. Sounds just right for me. Looks good and the butt dyno feels better response when I twist the wick. Very noticeable extra pull in 3rd, 4th and 5th. Less need to downshift on hills. Just a little twist an off we go.
B0002Z2MZ4|5|Absolute amazing!<br /><br />It's very easy to apply, non greasy, feel like it just cleans and gets absorbed or something. It leaves behind a nice matte finish; looks really great!<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B001EP28DC|5|Alsome ! Works great! Bolted right up to my honda crv. Also I would like to added that I received quick. Great job!
B0080DQDBY|1|I bought this and it did not work my car did not pass smog drove my car over 1000 miles before trying to get smog still did not pass
B000L9T7AY|5|Because of this one item my car is still with me, my car was broken into, steering wheel torn off, but the break lock keep the car from being stolen
B0081ST4V4|5|It seems unreal, but these things work! Dont waste your time with any other removal tricks and just get these and save the trouble.
B00E16M1S8|5|great product
B001CHG17Q|3|I tested the product in a pot of water as it began to boil. It opened at the 180 degree mark, but if you have a mostly stock 5.3 Silverado don't waste your money. My truck is still running at 210 degrees. Haven't seen a lower operating temp yet. Maybe when I get on the highway or come winter the truck will run cooler, but I haven't seen a difference yet. Also, If you are buying this product because you want a stage 2 Jet module, don't waste your money. I recommend doing the Stage 2 or mild tune 1st, and if you still think you need a lower temp thermostat, then buy this... Installation was easy. Had to give the truck extra time to run to bleed off the air in the system, but I have had no issues yet. I used the included intructions that worked fine, but i also referenced similar installations on Youtube and have a Haynes repair manual that I defer to for any jobs on my truck.
B009IK9P18|5|These are great little items I really like them as they fit the contour of my mirrors
B008G4Y076|5|Excellent product...
B004OFNJZ0|5|Having two separate shades makes all the sense and I appreciate being able to place them according to where the sun will be shining in and overheating the car. Excellent product!
B000C9M3JU|5|Excellent quality, OEM fit for trooper 95 SOHC, Easy and smooth installation, it comes with the pins thumbs up,  I recommend this product.
B000C83SRC|1|to small wrong relay
B00NPUULKG|4|Looks sharp... The point on the front hits your flip up window and could use two more mounting brackets for the back to keep the vibration down... ez modifications to solve..
B00K81M6W6|4|small but i like it
B00US4DK1Y|5|love it..have to have some muscle to get it on but once on fits snug and great
B007A2PXXK|5|I bought a new Honda Accord Hybrid with beige leather interior and within just a couple months I noticed that my dark jeans were leaving stains on the leather. This product works great! I just rubbed it on and the jeans dye came out. I also purchased the leather protection cream so hopefully there won't be any re-staining too soon. I'd highly recommend this product.
B000A8J97C|5|looks awesome on my truck
B00TPXO9RI|3|Quality is good. A bit too short for my liking but it's a nice product
B00COYNY1W|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B001AX811Q|2|Good material, terrible directions,and terrible fit. Pipes came up 6&#34; short of my rear bumper. When I called the tech line they told me that I only should have slid the pipes together with no more than 1/2&#34; into the other. I've done multiple exhaust installations and thats just not true. Luckily I was able to have 2 extensions made to fix the problem. The sound is extremely quiet. Probably quieter than stock.
B00OC2K0HU|5|I love that!
B00LNE04NA|5|good quality, fit the existing holes.
B00VALG1SI|5|Thank you
B003YNYCJ0|5|Great filter.  My A/C smells fresh.  I've been putting off replacing it because the location of the cabin air filter in a 2006 mazda 3 is hard to get to.  Finally got around to doing it today and I was glad I did.  The old filter looked gross. I was going to get this originally at a major auto parts store down the street, but their price is way more expensive than amazon.
B00266AE3Y|5|Brand new and easy to install
B00LY8V14G|5|It was a perfect fit and held up to a -30psi vacuum and a positive 200psi pressure in my basic test.  Time will tell how long it lasts.
B00BCH4WTA|5|Love this spray bottle.  My plants can't get enough water.
B00926I794|5|Great looking on my goldwing
B00ANA5XMC|5|Awesome! Best fit...simple.....affordable....looks great!
B00KC39BE6|5|On receiving it, the battery was almost fully charged which is a good sign that it was stored properly.  It fix as expected from the dimensions except for the terminal height -- on the original battery, the tops of the terminal posts were even with the top of the battery case; on this battery, they are about 8mm lower than the top.  In my application, this tiny difference prevented the cables from connecting so I had to add 8mm hex standoffs (e.g. McMaster 93655A657) as terminal extensions.  Then everything fit as original.  Remember to account for the thickness of washers.<br /><br />Minor negative: no obvious sign of manufacture date.
B0099J7DA8|5|Really great accessory for the car mods I have in mind.
B00N9BS5FE|4|The boot portion is just fine, the clamps they give are kind of weak.
B002OMRSOS|5|Great knee sliders. Last a looong time.
B00UNTU3VO|5|Performs just as advertised.  Delivered on time, just in time to remove the days dust.
B00CDW2MCM|5|A permanent member of my bike box.<br />Nice clear gauge. Pumps quickly. Remember to keep the engine running to avoid draining your battery.
B00FW1JXGO|3|The actual product itself rates about four stars, but then the caveat arises: no instructions,. There are instructions on You Tube, but there should be instructions with this product when shipped to the buyer. There is a small note on the package listing where the emitters go, but no instructions detailing how to place them there. As for tools, I suggest the use of a plain, completely unsharpened butter knife, then take you time and test each installation, as these emitters are polarized and there is a 50% chance of putting them in backwards. If they do not give off light, they have to be turned in the opposite direction ( 180 degrees ). You will have some left over ( 2012 4Runner ) for what ever reason ( better too many than not enough ) and that can be perplexing in itself. Overall, 4 stars to the emitters and 2 stars for the support ( or lack thereof ), becoming an overall 3 star final score, IMHO. Were it not for the internet, this item would have been sent back for a refund. Once installed - properly - they do appear to be brighter than the  incandescent bulbs they replace, and will probably last longer in the final analysis.
B00BTLEIIY|1|Not very good. Bought these for my 2013 F-150. Tried putting on and several of the straps ripped right off and one strap was unraveled to the point I couldn't even use it!! Would never purchase again!
B004ZQN1RO|3|Its a thermostat....
B00NB5CAPY|3|Frame posts that insert into door not quite correct but after a little tweaking  aventualy fit. Seals make the door bulge.
B000JI9J8W|3|I got this hitch for a 98 Chevrolet Venture van, I watched a bunch of videos on how to install it and figured it wasn't that hard.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />If you get this there are a few things that you need to be aware of:<br />- go find a video on your vehicle for installing this hitch<br />- get under your vehicle and see how its actually going to be installed (you might need a straight edge)<br />- TAKE CAREFUL NOTE IF THERE ARE ANY BUMPS WHERE THE HITCH IS GOING TO MOUNT!!!!!<br />- Find a good hardware store or fastener store!!! They include the bare MINIMUM for hardware, I have to go get a 1/2&#34; x 3&#34; carriage bolt that is grade 8, pretty damn hard to find!<br />- They also include the bare minimum of spacers, I have an 11/16&#34; gap for the passenger side, they don't have enough spacers for that! Also I had to space the hitch out away from the frame by 1/8&#34; of an inch because of how my van is made.
B007F1FMIC|5|I bought this more than three years ago because I was tired of having to tap ash into my hand to avoid breaking a bowl on a glass ashtray and wanted something to keep all the little pieces of paraphrenalia contained. It's been in regular use since then, bashed around, exposed to high levels of heat, and just generally abused. It still looks exactly like the day I bought it, if a bit dusty. It holds enough ash that it doesn't have to be emptied too frequently if you're lazy about it, and the 14 and 18mm holes are useful for bowls and pokey tools. The slits in the side can hold a lighter or papers. There might be more holes than you need, but it works aesthetically and doesn't impede the performance at all. Absolutely recommend.
B000CQTSO6|5|Quiet and easy to install. Fits 2007 Hyundai Tucson.  I added high temp brake grease to back of each as well as the new clips where they meet the pads no noise at all.
B00PFHC15K|5|Holds more than I expected. Keeps cold foods cold.
B00JR4D7AA|5|I have been using this type of tape for a very long time, but when I needed smaller strips I would cut the wider version I had, which never worked out as planned. No need any more. This makes it great to use in smaller applications.
B00826OVWW|1|When I bought this I knew it wasn't going to be the highest quality but my expectations were way to high. I put it together and 1 of the casters would not screw in properly. We were doing a craft project in the garage and my Wife decided to sit on it. One of the other caster fell apart. She is a whopping 140 lbs. This thing is supposed to be rated for 300 lbs. We also found that a 3rd caster lost it's ball bearings.
B000BUTDCA|1|Risk of fire. The danger is between the 50A breaker at the campground panel and the 30A breaker in the RV. In other words, the 30A cord and where it makes the transition from cord to the RV's 30A hard wire that goes to the RV's breaker panel. I have repaired an RV where the 30A cord/hard wire transition (in a metal junction box) burned up all of the wiring inside the junction box.  If it wasn't for the metal junction box, it would likely have burned up the RV instead. Everything between the campground panel and the RV's breaker panel (internal RV wiring and cord) is designed to carry 30A - and you will be plugging it into a 50A breaker. Ask any electrician about attaching a 30A cord to a 50A breaker.
B009FRFZ4K|5|loved this. looks good
B00KZJQ2L2|5|I love this shade.  It fits my Chevy Traverse which has a very large windshield.  It keeps my car cool even in San Antonio.  And it folds up very small.  The accordion-style shade I had before would not fold up this small.  It was always in the way.  This one can be tucked under the seat and completely out of the way. I had some trouble learning how to fold it, but the company sent me a pdf with instructions on how to fold and store the shade, which I greatly appreciate.  I was a little hesitant because the price was so much higher than similar products.  But now that I have it, I feel it was worth it.
B0093N7NTG|2|I have had to purchase this unit twice and this was my second one. They both failed for no reason at all in less than 1 year. I had them wired correctly and checked the grounds and all both times. The second one I tried to contact the company directly and got no response. I have since purchased another companies but it seems like in both of my cases something went wrong with the control box itself. The first one just stopped working on its own and the second one started making my turn signals blink incorrectly or randomly on there own!.
B007TYADGG|5|Direct replacement for a fraction of the price.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|FIts perfect!  Love it!
B00OX5GSRW|5|Fits 2005 Z71 Chevy Tahoe. Super easy to install. Works fine.
B00BTLEIIY|4|Made my car look extra clean.  The only thing that would of made it better is if were stretcher.  So with that being said it fit snug with no sagging.  On the back side of the seat the fabric did tear a tad but not really noticeable. I would purchase again
B000CD383G|5|Great value for these, $38 each delivered in 2 days, fitted my 99 Dodge Dakota perfectly, thanks again Amazon
B000CFQB8S|5|Cleaned up the filter very well and seems to be working just as it should.
B003YKX44M|4|I like the actual vent shades, but the first set came delivered broken, Amazon was great, they took them right back and delivered a new set. Now, DO NOT believe the truck fit program on the web page (Your Garage) , these vent shades DO NOT fit the 2014 Dodge Ram, Crew Cab as the rear vent shades are @ 6 inches too short. I ended up going to EGR and buying the rear vent shades. A little peeved at that. Just so you know, this part is 572651, the correct part number is 572751
B00EIIP9EM|3|Nice product - but the first day -  i used the tire stem caps the Honda logos fell off.
B00KTJ2J9M|4|These worked just fine.  My only complaint, as others have also stated, is that the trunk button is a little too sensitive.  Other than that, I'm happy.
B004HEKJ56|5|Great price on a great product!
B00G5RUCTQ|5|Great plate frame, looks great on the car!
B00557XT2E|5|perfect fit and priced well under oem at dealer.
B000IY5YLI|5|Awesome!  Saved me hundreds versus the OEM parts and the Gates brand is not some cheap knockoff.  I had been hearing belt chirping from a failed bearing for a couple months and these did the trick.<br /><br />Despite the picture, as has been noted this DOES include both pulleys.<br /><br />On my 3.2L Acura TL (2008, but will work in the full year range) this was a fairly easy install- maybe 35-40 minutes, start to finish.  Also replaced the belt while I was at it.
B00MGI60RQ|5|bright as i wanted them to be!
B004W9ABC2|3|Work, look oem, shouldn't cost as much as they do.
B005EUYH5U|5|RECIPIENT LOVED IT
B000C2SA4E|5|Great product and price
B005CW9P2K|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B007TG7HVS|5|Way better than my last wipers.
B000BRJVSY|5|Love them. Looks great on our awning.
B00TOFJW56|4|OK for Taiwan junk
B000JPG97E|5|awesome! I got 33 inch wheels on my 95 Jeep YJ and you can really feel the horsepower. thanks!!
B004I0YD1A|5|The light assembly was an exact fit for the factory original. Took less than two minutes to install.
B00JHK81X2|5|As described, great value for price.  Enough room left in bag to add additional items.  Tools are good quality.  Love it.
B006FDD74W|4|No complaints, works fine.
B004SJAY8M|4|Could be brighter but good for the price. Install was pretty straightforward.
B0060OJWJU|5|Great look and fit. Haven't had any issues with it. It's barely distinguishable from the factory unit.
B00IX26X12|1|Don't fit on my truck
B00UMQ5P8O|2|Not oem. Bolts started rusting immediately. To be expected for this price
B00GTJVMAI|5|the same part number fits both doors
B0000AYB7N|5|Galaxy makes the best. I have used them on the past 9 boats I have purchased and they have never failed me.
B000C1Q6IM|5|Installed these pads on a C6 Corvette. I replaced the factory installed semi-metallic pads that had 12000 miles on them. The braking power was the  same as the stock pads, but the low speed squeal was completely eliminated. They also gave the pedal a much better feel under all braking conditions. Pedal feedback is much smoother. They also have eliminated 90 percent of the brake dust on the wheels. These pads did exactly what I hoped they would do.
B000CAXIBQ|5|Great OEM replacement.
B00HE67ECU|2|It was not the same color as my paint. Was actually a darker more purplish red. Not good.
B00166LS1W|5|functions as expected
B00DO7FKJW|5|Serves the purpose. The good thing is it's no fragile as other  holders. One of those came broken because of fragility . This one is stern. Stays well one the windshield even when its hot.
B000NW8E3A|5|Fit my '06 5.3L Silverado fine.  Easy swap.  Threads came prelubricated.
B003CEJXGI|4|Not as solid as the original, but what they heck; 4 of them for 20 bucks! I used one for the one lost and will keep the other 3 as a spare. Make sure you bang them all around the rim really good (a rubber mallet would help), and check it for a few days. so far, so good!
B00TUK0BCI|4|the only issue was the bar came with 2 wrong bolts, I had to go to ace and purchase the correct ones, otherwise the install was easy and they work well
B0055B121U|5|Don't get one without the other
B00BQ083HA|5|Great product
B000GV9N06|5|I have never installed anything on my motorcycle and this was pretty simple.. Came with all bolts and washers.looks great
B002OUMVWY|5|Great
B008RUIT1W|4|Good
B003BZD03K|5|Great
B00HNBPLSK|5|Great wipers fit perfect thanks
B001CEG90I|5|Easy to install.  Just follow some Youtube videos.
B00A8MZ7IA|4|All in all a good towel, you might want to consider giving them a quick wash before using them. Straight out of the package they had quite a bit of loose lint fall off them. But, once they were shook out they were just as good as any other microfiber cloth. I can especially appreciate the different texturing one each side, one side for detailing the other for water absorption. For the price, they're a decent enough buy.
B00HFAHYDY|5|It looks great!  Everyone that see's it returns a smile every time. Some even laugh out loud.
B00062YUX0|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|just as described love it
B004ME11FS|5|Perfect water hose for my RV
B00GLYPTAK|5|Great protection frame.
B00A7LO4O0|5|Good quality. Worked well. Looks great.
B009NUY4PU|5|I recently bought a new car that didn't have a receiver hitch to put my bike rack on.  I decided to go with a 2 inch receiver even though my bike rack was 1 1/4 inch because I also have a trailer that is a 2 inch.  After extensive research I decided to go with this adapter because 1) I liked the design and ability to use either on the inside or outside of a receiver and 2) because of the length, all the others were way too long, and 3) because of the reviews from others that I had read.<br /><br />I was needing this adapter before an upcoming weekend and so I called DiscountRamps.com directly to see about getting the item expedited.  I spoke with a guy named Andy who was super helpful and friendly.  He took my order over the phone and two days later UPS delivered as promised.<br /><br />Once you add in standard ground shipping, the price for this adapter at DiscountRamps.com is the same price as at Amazon.com.  Even though I am an Amazon Prime member, I still decided to go with DiscountRamps.com because because of the high quality of customer service I received.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this hitch adapter, as well as DiscountRamps.com to anybody!
B005QZNE8Y|5|excellent
B00O5KG1WM|5|Great product, shipped quick , excellent finish and fit and all hardware included.
B00DFMFYCO|5|Nice size. Looks great
B00E5NO07W|5|Good
B0051NNI1Y|4|Fits 2010 f150 standard box well. Only downgrade is that the clamps are plastic and should be made if steel or aluminum.
B00C1YI2XA|5|Well
B00LX6PQC2|5|Great sticker
B011AKWXZI|5|These are great, they fit my BMW 328i sedan. Shipping was fast, it came before the arriving time! Both of the right and left Orders.
B007Y85U2E|4|Working just great and was a snap to change plus I saved over 100. 00 instead of going to the big name guys. ....very satisfied  !!!!!
B00075XCT4|3|This hitch, while the description says that it will fit 1999-04 Grand Cherokees with or without the gas tank skid plate with no problems, is a pain to install if you have the skid plate (which almost all Grand Cherokees do.). It will fit eventually, but be prepared to bend, pry and hammer both the hitch and the gas tank skid for several hours to get everything to line up correctly (it won't at first).  The mounting brackets on the hitch rub against the gas tank skid and pushes it inward, which makes it very difficult to align everything correctly.<br />Be prepared to spend an hour or so wrenching out very rusty bolts.  Spraying them with WD-40 will help.  The rear most bolts (closest to the back of the Jeep) cannot be reached with a socket; I ended up drilling 2 access holes up into the rear bumper in order to reach them.<br />This is not a one man job for sure, and is probably best suited to a shop with a lift and proper tools.  If you have a few friends, it's doable in your driveway but plan on setting aside a few hours.  All in all once you get it in, it's very solid and looks great.
B008G27QL0|5|great part good looking light
B000JZD7EC|5|Dorman saved the day as well as my wallet. These are the same item you'll receive from the big parts chains in different branded boxes. So why pay the outrageous prices for the same item. Quality is excellent and so is the fit. You will not get any mounting hardware, but you won't get robbed either. Oh you will get cotter pin and retaining nut. I was referring to mounting bolts when I said no hardware. Rubber seems excellent and so is part overall. Can't beat the quality of Dorman for the price. Ball joint and bushings are all correct fitting and installation was a breeze. Thanks Dorman for the excellent part with out the theft of my wallet. Thanks amazon for another quality part and service!
B00Q6A7R8Q|5|Looks very nice
B00LIT164G|5|Was exactly what I needed.  It fit perfectly and was super easy to install. I'm really glad I ordered thins instead of just trying to get the license plate on there some other way.
B00X11N2QO|5|Great price. Great fit. They do what I need thern to.
B00AXQDMQU|5|Great Fit and installation was easy. Had a bit of trouble getting the straps to not interfere with the seat adjusters, but that was not a fault of the seat covers, just lack of room under the seat. The material is great and appears to be something that will wear well.
B00ABYVTXM|3|This product works alright on vehicles but I believe motorcycle owners would benfit the most from this. It takes a long time for any car or truck but I can see this being great for the bikes out there.
B004VR08E6|5|They look great and were easy to install. No complaints after two months
B009XISP02|4|Exactly as advertised. works well.
B009EVMQLW|1|These In-channel Vent Shades did not fit my car. I ordered the correct make and model. All 4 windows get stuck everytime I roll it down past the vent shade. I called the manufacturer and they are going to send me a replacement part.  I sure hope so.  No the problem is getting these out of my window without tearing up the channel.
B010RHWKJY|1|The organizer was not as I expected. The quality is poor overall is extremely flimsy. The upper pocket hangs down preventing anything from staying put. I tried adjusting the straps tighter and looser but either way the pocket hung open. I like the cooler feature. However I have not used it. I feel that this particular organizer just doesn't get the job done as advertised. I am no longer using mine as the coupons I attempted to place in upper pocket ended up on the ground numerous times.
B00IMK0NAC|5|It's a perfect fit, and I love the Buick emblem embossed into it.
B0015Y6GDU|3|It fits. Elastic broke when mounted the first time. Wound up replacing elastic with slightly heavier duty bungee cord. Product made of cheap materials. Sometimes you get what you pay for. But then again if it gets stolen like the 1st one I'm not out big bucks. So it will work for now.
B00GKHAFZ2|5|use the old nut
B006CPMCB2|4|does its job
B001F0GZZ8|5|I use this stuff on my pontoon seats, works well as leave it uncovered and moored all summer.
B003ASQO8Q|5|Very great product to have, and the 3 pack allows you to share these keychains with your loved ones.<br /><br />The blade is very sharp, and will absolutely be able to cut through seat belts. And the bright colors help you pin-point the keychain (important for when disoriented from a hard collision). I feel safer knowing that I have these on my keys for emergencies.
B00O2DTEOO|3|This unit comes with NO wiring diagram and there doesn't seem to be any available. what is one to do?
B002935IV2|5|Nice product. Is very well made and did a great job on vacation .
B004W0QISM|4|Let me begin by saying that the shipping was that of Amazon Prime speeds, without actually being Prime. I was impressed seeing it in my mail two days before the earliest estimated date. I live in NH too so that is impressive. The actual product is pretty good. I have a 2008 Dodge Avenger which has plastic arm rests on the doors. Long drives would fatigue my elbow. As of right now I am only using one on the driver side since my arm always has to be raised to be on the wheel. I only went on a short trip but am happy to say that the product does just as it advertises. It collapses to nearly the height of the thing you put it on, and is very comfortable. It is made of a material that would resist water. My concern was opening the door on a rainy day and having this suck up all the moisture that lands on it. The material seems as though it would be more willing to resist the water falling on it, which is great. The velcro supplied is wide so I am also confident that this thing won't move around, at least not in the near future. I was sure to clean the area with dish soap and rubbing alcohol to make sure the adhesive would stick the greatest. The reason why I deducted a star is because I wasn't too excited about the zipper being exposed. I would have wished that you could tuck the zipper into the fabric like you can on other things, that way I can push the zippered side against the wall of the door so that it isn't exposed. The reason why I can't do that is fear that the exposed zipper would eventually scratch the plastic on the door. Another thing is that it appears cheap (it kind of was). I'm sure it will hold up for at least a few years, but when I have a polished exterior, and when I use something like interior detailer to shine up my interior plastic, this kind of sticks out. That is partially why I am only using one of the two for the driver side. I will keep it adhered though because to me, having the comfort is more important than feeling classy when cruising on longer trips.
B008Y1D568|5|Nice product
B000BRFQKQ|5|They fit perfectly
B001AJH1HK|4|work good. fasten right up to my 04 expedition
B0001EWLNO|3|Works well although it doesn't keep all the bugs off I would recommend it to anyone that's tired of using their window wipers and cleaning fluid constantly. This item will pay for itself within a couple of months of driving.
B0058N6OZ4|5|A slight bit of whistle at speed, but it they do what they're supposed to do, are adjustable, and they work.
B004I8SF5M|1|they didn't fit my 2002
B000BZYW5I|4|All parts arrived in the box as advertised. The box could have been sealed better bring as there is quite a few parts that could fall out. But it arrived intact.
B00PR567Y6|5|great product
B00GI781GE|1|Nice packaging but the light is dim and the product is very flimsy.
B00H34DMME|5|I love it
B002R0O7W8|1|Wrong one ,not for this model, Would cost to much to sent back
B00D44FNLU|4|my lawnmower likes it very much!
B000W7F2GI|2|The magnet on the bottle is basically worthless, it doesn't really stick to anything when the bottle's empty, let alone full. I wouldn't trust it anywhere near my vehicle's finished surfaces.<br /><br />The tube is also too short and too stiff to work on the bleeder nipples of my 1991 FJ80 Land Cruiser. I ended up getting longer lines and just bleeding the brakes with a friend.<br /><br />Don't have a friend? Spend the $17 n a couple six-packs of a local craft beer and basically everybody is willing to be your friend for an hour of pushing the brake pedal.
B004XRQ4B0|5|Super fast shipping, & they smell so good!
B000HTRNRC|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B00029JXNE|5|Greatest
B002LS08U6|1|I bought these ignoring the bad reviews but they are all honest. these things suck! I have had them for 3 months and all the stitching is coming apart and they are completely crap. I do not feel safe in these and will be spending much more money to get a quality FOX glove.
B0031OQN0S|5|I ordered this seat cover set for our Kawasaki mule 4010 - gas model.  It fits great just as stated.  I would say it is a good value for the price.  And it came very quickly.
B000ALBZJY|1|Did not come with paint brush or stencil
B000EDUTWC|5|These are great! We installed them on our new motorhome in February and haven't had to replace them yet. It makes it so much easier for our two labradors to get in and out of the motorhome. Especially our senior lab. I think nine dollars is a reasonable price and is cheap enough that you can replace them as they Start to wear out. I will definitely buy them again.
B00K2SLS7O|5|I have a 2014 GMC Sierra Crew Cab and this fit perfect and looks very clean and factory.
B00GUSKOP2|5|Perfect replacement for the chrome badges.
B00HS5W61G|5|great product. GOOD PRICE.
B00BG8NVAQ|5|Looks great and was easy to install.
B00R2NEHIY|5|Great
B002T0B530|5|Works great. The packaging was a bit scketchy because one of the struts was poking out of the box when they arrived, but they were not damaged and fit just fine.
B008F8Q8WS|5|Great part for the price !
B001DRHMRI|5|Works as advertised for a BMW 535xi!
B009IFIKAA|5|Fits like a glove.
B0000AX660|2|Not particularly happy with the winch.  It is extremely slow. We have to hold the cable and direct it to wind up properly or it bunches up.  This is not easy due to the fact that the cable actually has a few &#34;snags&#34; in it. They should have some coating on the cable so it doesn't snag or catch.
B000FOUB8M|5|Love it. Use it all the time.
B00EJA3BU8|5|Arrived just in time. Perfect fit and easy to assemble.
B00153EYR6|5|I have not hooked it up yet but it does look nise
B00UPHUA1M|5|The pair of signal lights came sooner than expected , and were of top quality ! They were every thing i expected and more .
B00065L2D8|4|works well
B000KKPFFA|5|worked perfectly
B00LIAOUSY|2|The lights did not fit perfect.They are loose..
B008G2236S|5|makes my truck look new<br />very easy to install
B003ZGD33C|5|Fits nice!  I like how it tucks the license plate away as far beneath the bike it can go with it still being visible.
B0073MF9DQ|5|Highly recommended, great quality and value.
B00PRBE2NS|3|installed ok ...but the rope knot came loose the next day....had to repair it right and tie two knots...works ok now
B000GTZT4C|1|the picture shows 8 brake pads but the package I received only had 2 brake pads in it and the description did not say that it only fit one wheel. This is false advertising.
B00BGZ5EKY|5|Cool.. I like it.
B00Y7BLCQO|4|ok
B001GJ3FIS|2|Nozzle does not allow a full stream to flow out.  Th center of the nozzle has a large volume of water that drips out.  Creates weak power and messy water stream.
B0080G1E38|5|Perfect on 2008 drz 400sm
B000CBTGHK|5|worked great
B00FC22LZ8|5|Works well minor error that the customer service secure promptly.
B0076PXV4Y|5|worked great
B005G0WQG0|3|This appears to be a high quality part, and it does what it says it will do: convert a 2WD F150 to 4WD brake rotor compatibility. I had two issues with the product, hence a star reduction for each:<br />1. The exciter rings don't come pre-indexed. You'll need to ensure they are within 1mm of the ABS sensor all the way around or you'll get an ABS light. All 3 of mine came from the factory with alignment issues. If this happens, you'll have to completely disassemble and purchase a new 1-use spindle nut (don't ask me how I know). Factory hub-rotors come pre-indexeded, so this is an easy one to miss.<br />2.  Had a unit fail within the first 600 miles. Symptom was excessive play in the wheel. This turned into drivetrain vibes and would have lead to rapid tire wear if I didn't catch it. Amazon made it right by sending a replacement and picking up shipping, but I still had labor expense and spindle nut costs to re-replace.
B0026PEM24|5|great cover
B004C16S0O|4|Good value and good gift!
B00ZE5RGTY|5|The Car Accessory Bundle is one of those sets that you can't believe you waited so long to get once you have it!.<br /><br />This combination set includes:<br />- a set of Seat Catchers<br />- a 2 in 1 Non Slip Mat/Phone Mount<br />- a Baby On Board Sticker.<br /><br />The Seat Catcher fits in between the seat and the console, you know that narrow area that everything fall through and is too tight for you to easily slip you hand into and retrieve the item? Yeah.. that spot! Now you can use that area to store things. I keep a set of plastic silverware, several wet wipes, a couple of straws and breath mints. These are things that we always need and don't notice they are missing from the drive through bag until we have driven away.<br /><br />The Anti Slip Mat will cling to just about any surface and &#34;magically&#34; holds on to things like your change, phone, sun glasses, etc. I like to keep my cell phone on it while driving. It keeps it steady and not sliding around in my console.<br /><br />The Baby On Board Sticker is a cute sign to let others know you have a baby in the car.<br /><br />Overall the set us a nice way to organize things in your vehicle. The seat catcher and anti slip mat are super helpful to have in your vehicle. This set would make a great gift for anyone but especially for those that have a tough time keeping their vehicle organized.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.
B00A7MT4JO|5|Perfect fit
B00EKEGRVS|1|The clip is not tight enough and frequently falls off.  The spring of two of the three that I purchased fell out making them useless. I recommend ones with snaps and not springs like this one. The shipping took forever, I think that it was shipped from China.
B000BZLEHW|3|This is a re-manufactured Alternator - the product description did not list this as a re-manufactured part and no indication that a core exchange is possible.
B000HACYNY|4|Ok
B0010Z4MDK|5|Battery charged right up works great
B00CS7T0IQ|4|Nice mirrors but they don't have enough adjustments to work on the wildcat roll cage.
B0024E2S0U|4|Works Fine as a Replacement. We'll see how Durable it is in time.
B00PQWN5DQ|2|This is not a very good tire gauge. The numbers are super small and very hard to read. The marks between the major ten PSI units are at 2 PSI. The gauge is very hard to get centered on the valve and achieve a good seal. There are only two good things about this gauge, it has a bleed valve on the side and the rubber surround protects the gauge.<br /><br />Analog gauges are hard for most people to read. With everything digital the skill of reading an analog gauge has disappeared. This tire pressure gauge makes that job even harder. Because the increments are at 2 PSI, if your recommended pressure is 35 PSI, it is extremely difficult to tell when the needle is between two tick marks. It doesn't help that the needle is really large, and almost spans a full 2 PSI.<br /><br />The gauge is tiny - the number portion is a 1 inch diameter circle. 100 PSI is divided around 280 degrees of travel (roughly 3/4 of a circle). That's a lot of pressure to pack into not much space. The dial has PSI in white on the outside and KPa in red on the inside. Where the needle crosses the circle, it takes up almost a full 2 PSI, making it even harder to determine a precise reading.<br /><br />There are two great big rivets at just over 45 PSI and 58 PSI. That is a major horrible design flaw. It just happens one of my cars target tire pressure is 45 PSI - there is no way to accurately read that number with the rivet in the way.<br /><br />The gauge uses a method I don't care for because it leads to imprecise reading. The needle is locked in position at peak pressure. The needle is released by pressing the bleed valve on the side of the stem. Gauges that read live pressure without the one way valve are much more accurate. They are harder to read - but they are more accurate.<br /><br />I had a heck of a time getting this gauge to have a nice tight seal on every valve stem I tried. A lot of air leaked out while I was pushing the gauge on to the valve to get a reading. I've used a lot of tire pressure gauges and have never had this much trouble with leakage and alignment.<br /><br />The gauge looks nice. It is small, so it will fit in the glove compartment. The rubber tire around the gauge is nice, but really unnecessary. Given the poor precision of the gauge to begin with, that rubber protector doesn't do much good.<br /><br />I tested this gauge against my gold standard gauge - a Joe's Racing 60 PSI gauge. The two matched to within +/- 1 PSI. Given that this gauge can only be read to 1 PSI, I'd call that a match. However, I'm not so sure I would count on this gauge for important tire pressure. Tires could easily be off by more than 1 PSI between the four. That's the critical piece - even tire pressure, and it is hard to accomplish with this gauge.<br /><br />This gauge is currently $17. There are digital gauges that are more precise, easier to use, and lighter weight for about the same price. Really precise gauges aren't that much more money. Joes Racing comes in at $26, it is easier to read, glows in the dark, and is incredibly accurate.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.sure gauges and have never had this much trouble with leakage and alignment.<br /><br />The gauge looks nice.

B004GFTC0E|5|I had been looking for a product like this for a very long while. I had used several other products and was afraid of trying these sanding products because I was unsure whether it would help me headlights get restored or make them worse. In the end, it wasnt so hard after watching a YouTube video. The drill piece thing didn't work with my drill so I had to do it by hand. Either way the results were amazing! I strongly recommend this product!
