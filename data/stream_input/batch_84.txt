B003E6ZLBA|4|I normally would not buy clothes on line . However I knew my size cause carhartt jeans is all I wear. They fix just right and saved me at least a total of at 15.00 for two pairs. Not bad! My expeirence was very good!
B00AMGHB54|5|This is a Nice top !!! The cut, the print, the quality and the fábric in this top are perfect.
B0053XF85G|1|I'm sure it would work great if I could get it over my butt! Since it is so tight (to hold in your tummy) its almost impossible to get it over my butt and my butt is not that big.
B000N5GRMW|5|I purchased this item for my son to wear with his tux for prom. It came in right away and is a perfect fit! He loves it! I love it!
B004A9VTOS|5|They're a little big right now but shes only 12 months so thats expected....i love them though...they're very cute!
B00KNRB6H6|5|I love this apron. The fabric, while not heavy-duty, is durable and trustworthy. The pockets are small, and in a rather awkward place, but I never use pockets on aprons so it doesn't present a difficulty for me. Someone who uses pockets may want to be certain that the placement won't cause them difficulties. The ties at the waist and neck are of good quality material, and there's plenty of it to tie into a bow. This item came exactly as it appeared in the picture, and I've used it several times. It's one of the cutest aprons I've ever seen, and I would not hesitate to purchase it again.
B009FHJJDS|5|Just an all around great footed pajama.  It's a little thicker, so best for the colder nights (Buts that a CA cold night).
B00EY40JQI|3|the dress is made of gauze fabric. the belt is not included.<br />its a loose trapeze fit dress<br />unfinished hem
B002XFI7YQ|5|My 14 year old who's 6 feet tall loves this pant and I do too. The fit is great and the quality is excellent
B00GBMC9HI|5|nice enough said
B00UW4DRG8|5|Exactly what I wanted
B00CTUVE36|5|I ordered this shirt and a few other over busts to enhance my summer wardrobe and I have been cinching for the past few months because I was told it would take the inches off that I want. Anywho I purchased this s*** in hopes to be able to wear it out and it more than exceeded my expectations! I am 5'9 and I weight 200 pounds, I am a 40D and rather curvey! This overbust is amazing for the price. it is made very well and fits perfectly! I ordered an XL!
B0015PKAZE|5|Have worn these socks for years-was happy to find them available on the internet.
B00LTN6K1A|4|Very sexy piece!  Would photograph well.  I would say it would fit an american size xs-s.  Keep in mind the material isnt very comfortable so this is not somthing that I would purchase for long trm wear.  Good quality though.
B004359ZH2|5|I love the color & the way its made its perfect for my baby. I'm happy it came in a 3 pc. set.
B000VK0WYS|4|My daughter likes the bra but it is just a little small.  I caution you to go one cup size larger especially if you are heavy on the top.  Other than that I have no problem with the product.
B007D370NW|5|This hat is fantastic. All black meaning you can wear it on any colour of clothing because black blends in. A lot of people compliment it and its just $12 compared to the other snapbacks out there that are $24-$35 you cant go wrong making this purchase.
B00817DZ0G|3|The shirts fit fine until washed. Even in cold water they shrink 2 sizes. If you purchase order 2 sizes bigger wash then wear.
B00P7NYLAA|2|The hood is just really awkward. The sizing is good and its comfortable, but the hood just feels like a big weight crashing into the back of your neck. If the hood was removable it'd be fantastic but its not.
B0018OT5DA|5|The perfect jeans.
B00NGHCGJ2|5|Kid loved them.
B00N6QYJT8|5|well made fits great
B00IUG6BTK|5|Absolutely Love it fits and looks great!
B008O566JC|5|This one is no different than the many others I have ordered. This seller has it down pay! All the prints are easily recognizable and the fabric is so smooth and soft, not like the average t-shirt, that's for sure. Thanks!
B00LX0ZTIE|5|My daughter loves her coat! It fits great and is adorable too!
B00O8D7XSM|5|Love it but wow, it is huge!!  I can fit a whole other person in there with me!  Great for lounging in but wouldn't be comfortable to sleep in.  The quality was good I will buy again, just smaller.
B005EVR9SQ|5|I got this for my 22 year old cousin for Christmas. He absolutely loves it! He's worn it practically every day since.
B00ZJBHKUI|4|Great hoodie, delivered as expected. Fits a little small, but not too bad.
B00WT7WA8M|4|Nice quality! A pleasant change from ordinary colors.. My husband is pleased.
B00CRAW2KM|5|Knowing from previous reviews that this runs small, I ordered a size up and it fits perfect. This suit is VERY CUTE & flattering. I wear a size 4, and run between C/D. I ordered the size Medium. This fit me like it was made for me. Shipping takes forever, but that is to be expected, since it comes from China. For the price, I love it.
B005V07DPO|5|LOVE the shirt - pretty and well made --BUT I ordered 2 sizes larger - Mistake.  I am a Ladies size 12 and ordered 2X after reading reviews -- it was Huge so I'm now waiting for the new order in a size Large.
B00B81RXC8|5|This watch is just beautiful! Kind of big but I got it sized same day for 5 bucks at a jewelry shop. Love the color
B0041AX06G|5|Perfect size. I'm a dancer, and it STAYS PUT! :D
B00SU6G0GE|5|Love love this shirt.  It is so cute and very comfortable.  It is soft to the touch and you can wear it many ways.  Off the shoulder as described, up on your shoulders or one on and one off.  You will find it very flexible depending on the fashion you want to create that day.  Colors are great somewhat a Boho look with tye dye colors.  For me I typically wear a size medium and this fits me just fine.  It is very loose on me but with the elasticized neckline it fits great.
B00CSIN95U|2|The primary reason for buying these was because Reebok made a point of saying the legs won't ride up.  However, after only two washes the legs rolled up every time which is disappointing and annoying.  I won't be buying Reebok boxer briefs in the future!
B001G8XO12|3|Love the style of this coat. The fabric seemed of reasonable quality. BUT...I ordered it in a size LARGER than I normally wear (to allow for a sweater underneath on really cold days) and it was too small in the arms and shoulders..even with just a t-shirt under it.  What a shame, it's a really cute coat.
B00DKWDW7I|5|Fit very well. Good texture.
B006VT0OW8|4|I don't love it but I like it. It is cute. Not a big fan about how it ties up.
B00CSMG7ZK|5|Love it!
B00OUCQO72|5|Loved the dress...got compliments from everyone!!
B004ZXHZ42|5|Great Bra for maternity and nursing. I used this bra when I was pregnant because I was too large for my normal bras. I also used it for nursing. The bra fit comfy while I was in the last trimester and is still fitting really well as I lose all my baby weight. I wish they would sell this same brand/style in white. I want more of them!! Great buy and worth the money.
B004TKIY2S|5|This bra is exactly what I needed.  Something to wear around the house and to bed.  I'm not looking for support, just something that will hold pads in place when I leak.  When you need to wear a bra 24 hours a day, you start to feel overheated and restricted, and I found that a lot of nursing bras are so supportive that they don't let any air in, or force your boobs together and then in addition to leaking breast milk I've got sweat to deal with.  This bra is the next best thing to going bra-less, which is what I desparately desire at bed-time
B0046BKSRE|5|Comfy. Pocket is already falling off though after only having it a week. Yes fits a little big but we live a big robe. My husband and I share it and I will purchase a separate one for me
B00BCG2L44|5|the jeans fit very nicely.  I have a hard time finding twenty-nine inch inseams, for whatever reason, but these were just right.  no bunching at the shoe, which thirty inch inseams do.
B00KXGVTYM|5|These fit well.  Just what I wanted!
B00OQK0ZT6|5|Love this coat.  Fits and feels great on. Shipped fast. Excellent priced.  Very happy with it.
B00E8GROOC|5|Fits great!
B005SG0H22|5|Love it. Great quality and long enough to even wear heels with if i wanted. It drags a little and I have to lift it when walking.
B007G4QEXA|5|Totally cool !
B00BBU1R00|4|I got exactly what I expected.  It's a basic t-shirt, great color, good fit, pricey given it's a Jones however.
B003KNKL4Y|5|Very comfortable.  Great fit. Straps are comfortable, fabric is good.  Looks good under all types of tops. I Love it.
B00080JFA8|5|This is a terrific brand. I believe its developed more for people who want a seamless look with clothing but I purchased it because I needed non-underwire and firm support after breast surgery.  I know some reviews say its cut high in the arm, it does come up into the armpit area higher than a regular bra but not different than most sports bra.  The underarm area hits above my lymph node incision which is perfect for me.<br />The bra provides good support everywhere you need (sides, back,cups) without being too constricting.  The straps are wide and don't cut in or fall down.  I have not had problems with the lower band rolling up as some have noted.<br />This is not an inexpensive bra but it delivers for support and comfort at a time you really need it.  Launders well- dries quickly
B00CAUZ11Q|5|This Levi's Jeans have the perfect fit, have good quality, beautiful color, really comfortable and soft jeans, nice cut and inseam/pockets details.<br />I just wish I could have chosen the leg length. To me, it is not as long as shown in the picture.
B006FKLVPW|5|I liked the texture of the material, comfortable feeling as advertised \\"no wires to have trouble\\". Three different colors are also convenient for choices of garments.
B004SWJ44Y|5|awesome
B007R9DGTO|5|The Product I love it is beautiful and replica of the image I Recommend to bought Because the quality is wonderful ..
B000JHAYLY|5|great price
B004AA38CI|5|I loved the Mask!! I really like the quality and color. Thanks!!
B00HESUAJ2|4|I have purchased $35 leather-like leggings and they were awful. These were comfortable, sexy (got lots of compliments) and inexpensive. I'm 5'6, 130lbs and curvy, the medium fit perfectly. You have to ease them like you would stockings, roll them up your legs first. My only complaint is they are not warm, so do not wear them if it's very cold outside, your legs will get cold, lol. Other than that I'm very pleased.
B004V2N6PY|5|Top is lacy sheer, so I wear a camisole underneath it. Cute and sexy. Looks fragile so I recommend washing it with care, preferably in a lingerie bag.
B00C0VIVSK|5|This is a pretty neat little case. Pleople with a $250 hand reader can steal info from your credit cards. Men should use a stainless steel wallet and this case is a good alternative for women. The only problem is it is very small. Will only hold 8 credit cards and a small roll of cash. When the credit cards include your drivers license, debit card, insurance card, etc., you run out of room really fast. I wonder if it will scratch over time, but so far I really like it. Easy to find in my purse.
B009AGBP4A|5|Warm and comfortable, rugged.
B00N411FS8|3|I ordered this based on reviews and recommendations. It arrived very quickly and once I opened it I was impressed by the quality. I tried it on the night it arrived and really liked the feel of it. However, it was too short. I still liked the look of it, and wore it again the next day, but after about 2.5 hours of wear it was getting uncomfortable, so I took it off. The stitching on the bottom had already begun to unravel and the front boning slipped out. I think I will be able to add a few stitches and fix this. For the price, I think this is a great corset, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is a) tall, or b) planning on wearing it for any long period of time.
B009HJFEHO|3|Let me elaborate, it's very similar to the picture, but the flowers in the picture have more flourish, and the ones in real life, not so much. A couple of the feathers were very short and hard to see while on.
B00E006FAA|5|cool shirt
B0002TOS7A|5|This product from Gold Toe is comfortable and long lasting. Their quality has not changed in these cost cutting times.
B00LI6YB0K|5|LOVE IT
B00Q6P442S|5|cute, perfect fitting little girl pajamas.  My granddaughter loved them.
B0055NSPUY|1|This shirt was cut in the shape of a broad shouldered narrow waisted man.  I wear an 8 -10 Lands End blouse and this was too big in the arms and shoulders and too small in the waist.
B002ETVM0M|3|I was looking for something more substantial and comfortable than the cheap vinyl ponchos. The price was great for the quality. The lining on this is nice and comfortable.  The waterproof outside feels rubbery, but it doesn't feel like it would hold up for rough use, like hiking in the woods. It would probably be great for city use or sporting events.<br /><br />My main problem is the size. This poncho is great for kids and smaller adults but not for people taller than 5'6&#34;. If you are 6' tall, the rain will dump right onto your knees and soak your pants, and your arms will only be half covered. The hood is a bit snug too and as others have said, it's not very deep and has no bill to shield your face from the rain.<br /><br />Another problem is the lack of snaps on the sides. There needs to be more than one set to hold the sides together. If the wind is blowing, the rain comes right in. The poncho material is cut narrow compared to other ponchos and the bottom corners are significantly rounded, resulting in less coverage.<br /><br />If you're looking for a poncho for city use or sporting events for large kids or small adults, this would be a good choice. If you're larger or want something durable in the woods, search for a military ripstop nylon poncho. I really wanted to make this work because I like the color and lining, but unfortunately it was just too small and lacking in features. Returned.
B008R6TL5O|5|Good.
B0009MZYEQ|4|Over the years Thorlo Unisex cushion running crew socks have been my choice. No blistering after long runs or short walks.<br />Comfortable all the time.
B008VPXQWU|5|Beautiful socks for the price. I was expecting these to be mediocre and it's always difficult to order this type of thing online, but they are beautiful and well made.
B00CDB5NWY|1|The richness of the color is beautiful. But the sizing is not true to fit. ordered an L and it was the size of a small.
B0044YP4EU|4|Sorry for the all caps, but that's the only way these pajamas warrant a high rating. Otherwise, you will be very very disappointed.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />These are very soft, and cozy, and a nice thickness.<br />The quality is good.<br />The design is cute and the colors don't run on other clothes in the wash.<br />Even with lots of washings, the colors stay pretty bright, the cuffs stay in decent shape (no awful stretching).<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />These run freakishly small. Laughably, freakishly, frustratingly small.<br />Even when washed on cold/delicate, and very low heat/delicate, they do shrink a little. They're all cotton. It's to be expected. But if they're already  very small to begin with, it's something to keep in mind.<br /><br />I have a petite toddler. She (yes, SHE) loves Thomas the Train so much, and I was thrilled to find these in a retail store. At the time she was in a 12-18 months, so I bought the 18 month size. Which was hilariously too small. I returned them for the 24 months. HAHA! Too small.<br /><br />What? She's petite. Seriously. Like 30% weight and 50% height.<br /><br />So I returned them for the 3T. Which fit GREAT! And she wore those until she went up to a 24 month size in regular clothes. Then I had to buy the 4T to fit her. (And at that point, could order them from Amazon, knowing which size to buy.)<br /><br />It's been a year and she currently wears a 2-3T in regular clothes, and is wearing these pajamas in a 5T. Yes, the sleeves are a tad long on her, but the PJs fit snugly around her body and arms and legs, which reassures me they're safe. She will hopefully wear them all winter. But by the time she's in a full on 3T, I doubt these 5T Thomas pajamas will fit.<br /><br />So, buy these for their quality. Buy these for the character, but do NOT buy them for the size. And it is this manufacturer, by the way, with the sizing issues -- we've found other all cotton Thomas PJs that fit just fine right off the bat.<br /><br />(Also, you might want to look around for prices if you're wanting this particular design, because you might be able to find these in a local retail store for much, much cheaper prices.)t be able to find these in a local retail store for much, much cheaper prices.)
B0072IHSNK|4|This jaunty number is my apron while BBQing. Works great, cleans up great, and so far has not shrunk. Entirely satisfactory.
B00TTA1O7A|5|Perfect color, perfect fit, lightweight for layers
B00FXPW0BE|4|Decent but bigger than normal
B00HSEQTI8|2|I WANT MAKE A CHANGE
B00DO4HNUE|5|love it
B00UKRV0HA|4|Fits sallee that actual size. But it is an amazing dress for a casual evening.
B00S9WXAXA|5|The socks feel great and they are nicely packaged without any holes poked to hold the socks together.
B00I8IZJMK|1|These shorts ties in the front but is not a draw string.<br />If you dive into the water expect to leave them floating on the surface.<br />...not appropriate swimwear.
B00A17EW3S|3|18W runs pretty big...felt like I was wearing a size 20, but great price considering it was almost double at Macys!
B00KNVHGMG|5|Very cute summer dress
B00NYR5SEO|3|The quality of this dress is great.  It is adorable but it runs VERY small.  I ordered a size 14 for my 10 year old daughter and had to give it to my 7 year old daughter - it was that much smaller.  I reordered a 16 in hopes it will fit my 10 year old.
B00NPZE3R8|4|I love Genetic denim. They're my all time favorite jeans as far as fit & color. These were a very flattering fit but were a little snug in the waist. I usually don't experience that with jeans & am constantly tugging to keep the waist from falling. I ordered my usual size in Genetic denim in these jeans. I'm keeping them because although the waist is a little snug, the fit is so flattering overall. Legs look super long & instantly slims.
B0068XZ09O|4|These tights are just fine, they look great when i put my black ripped up tights over them, very spooky, so when i hit the club i look awesome. The tights are indeed very white and really pop,they wear more like stalkings than pants, but they are perfect for my clubbing needs. I would definitely recommend these.
B008ESZ62C|4|Love the shirt, runs a little small.
B00DCAMA6M|5|nice
B000J3YKO0|3|They were a little tight and were way too long for me. If you fit in normal, standard sizes, these should be fine. I have a bigger waist and short legs.
B006G7RI60|5|Purchased for my wife. She is quite curvy and many corset measurements online are incorrect for the actual product. This one however fit exactly as the size chart set it would based on her measurements (and she looks amazing in it!). We have also put the material through extensive testing with no issues. Very soft and the ribbing seems strong yet flexible.<br />Great buy for the price in my opinion.
B0039H14ME|1|I purchased the pink and grey version of this scarf... When it arrived it looked awful in the plastic bag.  I took it out and tried to even it out and fluff it up a bit, but it still looked like a dead animal... don't know if the other colors are ok, but would definitely NOT recommend the pink and grey stripe.
B004A7XYAW|5|I have worn Fruit of The Loom for many years and so far have had great luck with every package I buy. I have noticed that the waistbands don't hold up as well as they used to though.
B008ZRYTRA|3|Hat was great. Fir as expected. Colors were vibrant. But didn't light up.
B006TTS40O|5|These are very flattering, cute jeans. The fit is perfect, as well as the length, for a more petite frame (I'm 5'3&#34;).
B00JMOAIOS|5|The shirt is exactly as I expected it to be. I ordered a medium so it would fit a little looser and it's perfect. Very comfortable and cute.
B00CTUU2L6|4|looks great and very good quality for the price, I was very happy with the quality of this item i bought about 6 of them hahah
B00PIAPRX2|2|Not for large breasted women
B000QTY34Y|5|Purchased it for my son and he says it's better than he expected  -  really! likes it.......
B005OFLSWK|5|great
B00LEIAV8I|4|I have other Freya bras in the same general style (half cup) and size, but different colors, etc. For some reason, this one just didn't fit quite right..it seems to run a little larger than my other Freya bras. Too bad too, because it is really cute. BTW...it says padded in the description, but it isn't a 'padded bra', per se. I think what they're referring to is the lightly lined cup.
B00W2X895G|5|Really good quality and adorable.
B00JQAO1CS|3|It looked better than the pictures, however was a bit small for my 5 yr old who normally wears a 4t or 5t.
B00IOF6FDO|5|I realized after reading the small print that these are not American sizes, they are Chinese sizes, so &#34;large&#34; is actually a small in U.S. sizes.
B0089EIQ4G|5|I got this dress in royal blue. So soft, so comfy, nice length and easy to wear with flats. I will likely be getting this exact same dress in another color.
B007RX4IW4|1|Ugliest, poorest quality suit costume I've ever seen.
B00TG2K03A|1|Very disappointed! I'm a size 16/D (I can typically make a C/D cup work in swimsuits) with a tiny waist so I thought this suit would be perfect. I read all the reviews, looked at customer pictures and, per the sizing chart, I ordered a 2X.<br />The bottoms fit, but the crosshatch pattern was sewn so that the bands across the tummy sag in a bunch at the bottom instead of pulling tight to create the pattern. They were not as highwaist-ed as pictured, especially in the back where they were as low as any other swim bottoms. Also, the top was completely out of proportion with the bottom. It was made for someone who is very large up top with very tiny breasts...otherwise known as a man. The band around the top was way too big but the cup size was tiny, like an A/B cup, not a C/D. There was just no way I was going to stay covered, especially if I got in the water. Judging from the other reviews, I suppose these could be rare manufacturing issues. Thankfully, I paid less than $18 for the entire thing.
B007A3J3I0|3|... and I need longer sleeves. This is definitely a blast from the past (think early 2000 style) sweater dusters.
B002444VV4|4|It is small and that is the point of this style of underwear… but it is even a bit small for me in the crotch. It seems to be made well and I might purchase another in the future.
B00BJ8LM22|5|I bought this for my grandson and he loves them!! My grandson is a big Doctor fan!!! Thank you for having so much stuff with Doctor Who.
B00IKHJ8UI|5|These are very nice.
B00BUYUYVU|5|I bought this shirt for my 8 year old grandson and he absolutely loves it.  I think he probably wears it once or more every week.  Last year Angry Birds this year Skylanders. I made him very happy on Christmas morning. : )
B00G21IPF8|4|They are too small, order a larger size than you need. They are well made and very cute however. I do like them.
B002K6F7AK|5|Great bra for the price.
B00IJRIR2O|5|The dress was perfect for my daughters wedding. Came when it said and fit to my measurements.
B006GESH9U|5|As described
B00M5B12PO|4|The sleeves and neck fit fine but other than that it looks as though i am wearing a night gown...
B005XVFR18|4|These shorts arrived very quickly. They are comfortable and seem to be well made. The little pocket on the side is perfect for your phone or golf tees. The only issue is they do run a little big, but I guess that is what belts are for.
B002TLUFDU|4|My son said he likes them better then the Hanes that I used to get him
B00I6DEBNK|4|Lovely material and very unique dress, but WAY TOO SHORT for the office... and because the dress is paneled all around, I can't simply add a bottom layer to lengthen. I'm working with a tailor to try to lengthen the waist band, may have to change the zip all together, but I'm determined to make this work because the design is lovely.<br />For the record, the length is not work appropriate, I'm 5'3&#34;, 170 lbs and ordered a size large and the length was my only problem. Climate in my country is too hot for leggings or stockings so I have to find a way to adjust. Wish me luck!
B004CW7DG6|4|I bought this robe as a gift for a very picky person and she loves it!
B00QY2ZSBE|4|Material on the thin side, but still cute and i love the length.
B00120VEDO|5|good
B0033BBHPU|5|I use it everywhere i go it's very nice and good quality
B00JJAG132|2|No zipper or buttons and opening was too small for my shoulders. Looks like the body of the dress was a true medium and would have been fine had my shoulder fit in.
B009W49RAO|5|nice little multi tool for eating, knife and fork separate easily.  Spoon is a little large, its about 1/2 way between tea spoon and table spoon.
B00L5PM3QI|4|First shirt got lost in the mail but I contacted sellers and had one in time for Christmas!  Cute gift idea my brother said it was his favorite gift of all!
B00JFR0NME|5|My daughter loves it
B0008EOF1I|4|I wanted black denim; you've got to specify &#34;double black&#34; not any of the black this or black that they've got to get black denim, but after I did that it was fine.
B00NTT6E0O|1|I'm like the others the sizes are for very very small children and the return shipping isn't worth the time and cost......mine will be donated to the goodwill but will never recommend or shop with the company again.
B001FRG0UQ|5|I am a collector and this is one of the great meadls from the WW II era. I would recommend this to anyone wanting this item.
B007EYXTXK|5|I took the advice of other reviews and ordered a size larger than my usual size.  The coveralls fit over my normal pocket t shirt and jeans, but would be a little tight for wearing over a hoodie.  These don't have extra frills, but they seem to be well made for work.
B001HQJ8OU|5|I've been wearing fedoras for many years and this is one of the cooler ones I own.  I've worn it twice now and both times I've gotten tons of compliments on it.  It's nice and sturdy and I believe it'll hold up for a long time.  Thanks for a groovy topper.
B0012MR6GQ|5|High quality basic uniform shirt. Ordered one for my children for a special choir they are in requiring white tops and black bottoms. Nicely done!
B005CW0704|5|I used to wear Hanes briefs, and this XL briefs are a bit smaller than those I got used to. But still fit me well. Very comfortable, good fit. Came in funny colors — orange, green, blue.... Not the dull ones as on the picture, but I like them even more :)
B000T3TTQY|5|This is the best strapless bra I have ever had.  When I had my son ( 2 and a half months ago), my breasts went from a 32C to a 34DD.  I bought the 34D wacoal strapless and can finally wear the strapless items I bought to be convenient when I nursed.  I will buy in any more colors I can find.  Its still pretty ( lace) but doesnt add padding ( I dont want any more with my DD's!!!) and still holds you up- I thought this wasnt possible.  A must buy.
B00HAQQ164|5|The quality was great, super soft but still manly! Just like the jazz flute :)
B002CMLOOA|3|largeeeeee
B00G9TQT8S|5|We live near the ocean so this is the perfect theme. My 2 yr. old grandson loves Mickey Mouse and he looks adorable in it. You can't go wrong with a Disney approved outfit.
B00PA01BFI|5|It is the most stylish rain coat I've ever owned.
B00LVYAEJ6|4|So far so good as I just got them. They fit well, not too big, not too small (and I have a few lbs to lose).
B0009JOSAA|5|I bought the long sleeve SpaSilk onsies for my grandson so I know what a fine quality product they are.  This is the only brand I purchase now for my grandchildren.  Thicker, softer, larger and holds their shape.
B00JMQ7FRO|3|Way to small for my daughter. She gave the two I ordered to her smaller sister to wear under things.
B008W1ANQK|4|Only Can Be Used For Longer Hair Than Mine-!!!
B00DEK1HPK|5|ok
B00C9303K8|5|It´s so the best elastic belt that I bougth
B0077S35QY|5|Great product, Fast Shipping, Works Great, Thank You.
B002QNRG9C|5|I am impressed by the design of this product.  The seams are well sewn and the materials used are without flaw.
B0009UL0EQ|5|Amazing quality of this sweatshirt. Heavy cotton, warm to wear. Item is cut a bit larger but fits great. This is my 2nd sweatshirt and would buy more.
B00AQAZVNK|5|Ok
B003XT6BIU|5|Great fit. Awesome t-shirt.
B004WPHMTG|5|My 12-month old daughter was the cutest bee I'd ever seen.  The wings detach, which is great for a toddler.  The only complaint is that the headband was not very toddler-friendly, but we just put it on for one quick picture and then took it off.  It had a lot of room to accomodate several sizes of 12-18 month olds, including my skinny daughter.  If you have a taller toddler I might go a size up.
B00HFP8FGE|5|Excellent purchase, very pleased, I needed a larger size than I originally purchased only because of the top.
B00YBSO6D4|1|Item was too small. Also, the buttons are flimsy and hard to button. The overall material is not of good quality.
B00TX4SSKI|4|Bit snug for a size 6 but that seems to be because the metallic material is a little stiff. Thw back zipper was also stiff. Looks nice but quite shiny so it's suitable for a party.
B00NO77CDO|4|I really like these pants.  I have to wear navy pants at my job as part of our 'uniform' policy. Being a plus size girl, I hate getting pants that balloon out in the legs and are too wide at the bottom.  These are comfortable (a slightly unique fabric, but not gross). The length isn;t too bad for a short girl...one cuff and I am good to go.  They fit close enough but are not skin tight. Plus I like the high waist...no muffin top. I have already ordered my second pair.
B001B6LFEW|5|I honestly ordered this costume thinking it would not fit. All the reviews were from smaller women who were 6-7 months pregnant. I am 5' 7&#34; 190lbs. and my belly is measuring 44&#34; (around my hips and stomach). This costume fit me perfectly. Not too tight and just the right height. Not cheaply made. The maternity band on it is better material than the actual pants!
B003NX8CME|4|Very nice but the small could be a little smaller
B00XJ8INFY|5|Once you find your right size, these dresses are awesome.  I got compliments all day!  FYI - Can't be a rush purchase for an upcoming event, especially with return and reshipping if the dress doesn't fit right.
B00E7366KE|3|Love the print, picture was not blurry at all. Fits snug on me and bc I do have a large backside the waist kind of slinks down and cuts into my hips. A large black shirt covers that though and I love the design
B00NNZRFFC|5|I absolutely love these pjs! I just ordered two more pairs! I ordered these because I was in desperate need of fleece pjs because it is still below 0 here and no stores have any. Well now I will be ditching carters for these. The fabric is such a better quality. So soft and warm!
B00A6G4AM2|5|Love this brand!  Fit AMAZING!  Look GREAT!  Never buying another brand again!
B0038JSF16|2|Took to long to get here . Then the product it's huge those sizes are bigger than the ones in the states
B00GKCB51A|5|This fit perfect. Doesnt seem like its going to ride up in the water but doesnt seem like its going to stick to me either, just right.
B007H2SYPM|5|all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more
B00AC36784|5|Cute! :) My son wore these for Easter & they were great! :)
B00102NVI0|4|I bought this luggage cart to transport a child seat (a Britax Marathon) through the airport.  I had looked at carts made specifically for child seats and they are SO expensive.  This cart was a great price and the LATCH system attached straight to the cart, nice and easy.  I'm 5'8\\" tall and the height of the handle is ok for me, but would be too short for anyone much taller.  I'm not a huge fan of the attached cording that you would use to secure luggage, but it works.  Bungees would be better, I think.  Anyway, great, cheap system to transport a child seat!
B001O9C5HM|4|The suspenders were as expected. I would have liked them to have a black patch v. the brown, but they are strong and durable.
B00CUM9BKQ|5|I received this scarf free of charge in exchange for a review! I must say it's great for those early warm springs or summer days where warmth isn't really an issue but rather style Is your biggest concern. It's really soft too which I loved!
B001LELBZM|4|A cape is always fun.What can you say bad about a cape.
B0090FS6ES|5|Loved this outfit. The only problem was when my son grew out of it. Wish they had in bigger sizes so I can order again.
B00N8BVCEQ|1|This item runs small and is not easy to return.
B00AOUVWSK|2|I thought it would fit better than it did. And the material that it's made with is hard to alter.
B0037Z7BFM|3|Solidly built. But doesn't live up to the hype. The leather isn't especially supple. The organization system isn't especially ingenious. That said, it's worth the price, if the price was $40.
B00B1STOA2|5|I am usually not one for writing reviews but this top hat exceeds my expectations. It is made with quality material; the construction is superior; and the price is just right. It is definitely not one of your typical Halloween costume hats!
B007PESS6C|4|It is a nice product, good quality, according to what I expected of it and above all it was worth purchasing ...
B00GQY9QX6|5|For it being  a plus size it fits great.. I feel sexy and my husband is  very happy with it too.. it fits great!!
B00FY7VG5M|3|Love the length put it is see through! Not work appropriate
B00NPBYE1M|1|Its not sized right at all I'm a size 8 I got an xl in this so tight bad sizing on these
B00UKH3LCW|5|perfect.
B0031U0PSS|4|Looks good and seems to be made to last.  I like that it is a little wider than a standard belt.
B0034G65GK|3|the panties are nice but the material is extremely thin, long time the material was much thicker and why they send me of the same colour panties.
B00F6A74LC|4|muy bueno
B007XD4TGI|5|I love this shirt! The print on it is unique and the shirt is super soft! I ordered a small and I normally wear a Medium-Large, the small fit perfectly!
B002KGDLEE|4|Fits a bit snugly, but very nice shirt!
B008UBTKM0|5|I bought this for my granddaughter. it's good quality and very cute. I love it because it's different.<br />Thank you
B00007GPOB|5|This pencil bag is the cutest little bag and the perfect fit for any size purse. It can also be substituted for a make-up bag. The pencils are charming and write extremely well. The erasers leave very little residue and bits of eraser bahind. A perfect gift if you want to start a kate spade collection.
B000RDUFX2|4|Internet shopping has really changed the world. So many Australian companies have shut down production and moved it to China, bringing back these items at no savings to reflect the cheaper labor involved. This is my protest and I am pleasantly surprised at the price and quality of these Hanes singlets, AND, they AIN'T MADE IN CHINA!!! Even with the postage to Australia I have scored a bargain[[ASIN:B002X78T6A Hanes Classics Men's Classics 6-Pack A-Shirt Value Pack]]
B00EOCBAXQ|2|Nothing wrong with the jacket, just not my style.  Looks different than the picture.
B005PQPVUS|5|I have other pairs of these pants and the fit fine. The price was right so I purchased some additional pairs.
B0057ZAV20|1|Buyer never shipped it to me even though I  received a standard email saying it was shipped. Sadly I had nothing to wear on Halloween. After I reached out to the seller come to find out they were out of inventory and never had it in stock, when they sold it to me.
B00EZMLP1C|2|Not fitting and tight at all nor is it cute
B00LNCIKEC|5|I love this shirt! It was worth the wait (UK?) and fits perfectly!
B00FE3UUG2|5|Great Donetsk Russia shirt, thanks !
B0089N5PKU|5|The cap came in faster than originally expected.  The cap is well constructed, fits well, and is comfortable. The closure in back is secure.<br /><br />I like this cap.<br />After wearing it for about six weeks, 2 washings and getting trampled, the cap still looks great, is still comfortable and still my go-to hat for the summer.
B001PU9A9Q|5|These are fabulous!  They adhere well and do what they're supposed to do.  The case they come is nice as well and keeps them in good shape to reuse.
B00IDT1E5U|5|This is a great jacket, wish there was more Herock selection available
B00VCBXX4G|5|If I could give these six stars then I would.  They fit as expected and are VERY high quality.  The center snap on the bottom is gold for speedy snapping and that is a microcosm for the whole garment.  The cap sleeves are just way too cute.
B00CHQ4U88|5|I got this a s gift for my wife.  It looks good on her and fits great.  She uses it everyday.
B002ATW7OG|4|the right color and fit for my son-in-law.  I assume he likes them as he wears them quite a bit. the waist and length worked well.<br />Not sure how they do with the wash...
B00AQAW8CC|5|Love it. Fits perfectly and washes and drys very well. I'd definitely recommend this.
B00C0PIRC6|5|My wife and I love it!  Great for going to family pool parties, shows enough and not too much. Fit is perfect, wife is 5'1&#34; 120 lbs but is a little bigger on top and it look great on her.
B00K5V24BW|5|I was looking for something plus-size that looked sexy and made me feel sexy. This purchase did just that. It drove my boyfriend crazy and I feel sexier than I ever have when I wear it. It fits my plus size body perfectly. My only complaint is that there is no opening or way to open the under area. You pretty much have to take it off to have access. Other that that little hang up, make this a must have in your naughty drawer.
B00I1LL0RW|5|Great product
B00I1AHHD4|5|I loved this shirt so much, that I bought it a second time.  It is super comfortable and soft.  Looks good with or without a under shirt.  I wear this with paired with jeans or fleece leggings.<br /><br />I own the.... Plaid Freesia Raspberry and Plaid Dijon Red Clay.<br /><br />I typically wear a large (about 5'8&#34; and 185 lbs, dress size 12, 36C) and the shirt is true to fit.<br /><br />The buttons do not pull in the bust.  It is slightly tapered at the natural waist, so it does not just hang like a sack.  The length on me is past my waist, about mid-hip.<br /><br />I have washed the shirt several times and it has not shrunk or changed form in any way.
B00C2KETOY|5|goes great with my American flag speedo and aviator sunglasses.
B00S5K1772|3|It is too tight to wear almost anything else underneath.
B003A8H0J8|5|I was really a star of the party wearing this costume.  I like the idea, quality and cut, adjustable waist.
B005DIIRJA|5|My Australian friend wanted this shirt for Xmas!!  haha  He loves it.
B00DQF8SWS|4|Last second the bride changed the undershirt for my sons ring bearer outfit. I quickly ordered this shirt. Was at my doorstep two days later!<br /><br />Great fit but not great quality of material. One day use... Perfect! More than that... I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />But I say 4 stars because it was quick delivery& the shirt fit him perfectly.
B00MCBGBYE|5|Very good fit as expected
B00FAGHL4M|5|Recipient LOVES it.
B00CIZNZXE|4|Pretty thin material.... Wanted a cool, comfortable material for the hot Texas summer weather, but these seem to be a bit thin. I will have to see how they hold up after numerous washes. However, they should be cooler and more &#34;breathable.&#34;
B001JQLP3K|4|I don't often find bras that are pretty and supportive and underwires were not even in my wardrobe until a year ago.  This bra does have a tendency to dig in the sides, but I gently bent the side stay to curve outward and then no issues.  Great lift and separate even for my large-ness (42I).
B002W2I9MK|3|The funny feet slippers are funny.  They are plastic with a thin insole.  so do not buy them for comfort only for fun.
B004HWTNTG|5|Purchased this bikini for a beach vacation in Miami; ended up wearing it in many more places and on many more occasions than that. Definitely one of my most favorite bikinis of all times! Fits really well (I'm a size 2-4 or small, 34B) and there's definitely enough room to adjust the swimsuit to make it a smaller or larger. Good quality overall. I've worn it many times to pool parties and I'm pleased to say that the metallic shine on the fabric hasn't faded much (if at all), nor has any of the paint come off on the metal rings.<br />I typically do avoid wearing this swimsuit to an actual beach, as I do know that the sand can be very abrasive and would likely result in the metallic shine fading away quickly. However, it still withstood the roughness of the sand on the few occasions, when I did wear it to the beach :) I would like to note that the bra does NOT have padding. However, I never found it to be a problem - the bra still provides good support (at least for my size) and is by no means see-through.<br />I would definitely recommend this product! Perfect for pool parties :)
B008J4WECG|5|I LOVE this shirt! It's a little retro, a little Flashdance-y, adorable, and affordable. Works great with shorts, jeans or leggings. The neckline is wide, so I like putting a black or Steelers-gold tank top underneath. Sleeve length works well for warm or cool weather. I prefer this to the ladies-cut jerseys, those are still kind of bulky for me. This is a flattering fit, and seems to run true to size. GO STEELERS!!!
B00AY6HDKU|5|I was skeptical to buy this jacket, because usually when you're a gamer looking for  your fan memorabilia its a cheap plastic fake. This jacket looks light but it works. I felt cool and amazing at the same time. Such a beautiful Jacket. My only bother was when I received it their was some plastic over the red color and white stripes. I was worried in breaking the item, but it didn't. It's a very beautiful Jacket.  I highly recommend anyone that loves the game Prototype or Alex Mercer the character to get it, That or just to have a good functional jacket.<br />The delivery came fast. I'm very happy with this product.
B00HHBQ07W|4|I bought a size larger than normal to have plenty of room for activity, and it was very large. I took it in 2 inches and still have plenty of room. However, I'm happy with it because it's perfect for dance class and exercising. It's lightweight, washes and dries easily--no fuss. It's hemless in case you didn't see that in the description. I probably wouldn't wear it for casual use in company, but it fit my purpose for it perfectly.
B003KJSF96|2|it's not as flattering as i had hoped, but it could be that i'm not as cute as i hope.
B008LWT45Q|2|They are not attractive at all
B000SKLTIE|5|Sweet comfy cozy. Wearing well and I'm a guy that loves clean white socks. Getting a great deal on socks is what I always look for
B00KEIVPT8|3|look very good but the quallty not that good
B00D840A8C|3|This sweatshirt is cute but runs a little large. I love the smaller sleeves and wished they were long enough to have a thumb hole for extra coziness. It would be cute if it came in other colors as well.
B001RMO3NK|5|WORKS WELL WITH ABOUT 3 CARDS. THE OTHER SIDE FOR BILLS. I SAW THIS AT A MENS CLOTHING STORE AND THE PRICE WAS $40.
B0064HI8DY|5|Very comfortable
B003HP4TVQ|5|Perfect accessory for what I wanted to wear!<br />Good quality for the price, certaily would recommend this product to anyone.<br />It's exactly what I had envisioned, thanks!
B00290WRFA|5|gave as a gift and was loved
B008CL27DM|5|By Far the best wallet i have ever owned. It feels like a good quality product! Money clip is very strong so you dont have to worry about your money falling out or getting pulled out. The only down side is there is no spot for your ID. You just have to put it into one of the credit card slots.
B00FL1ZBTS|5|The skirt fits true to size and I love it. It is pretty thin but for the price, I couldn't expect anything any better. I've ordered 2 more in different colors and I love them too!
B00KIZMESI|4|The medium was a tad small on me (Waist: 30&#34; Bust:36B, 135lbs) but not enough to return. The fabric isn't that nice but seems right for the price. Overall a nice basic piece.
B005X5FG2O|3|This bra is perfect for running and other cardio. My only gripe is, the padding is warped and make me look as though I have stuffed my bra with tissue. I have to straighten out the pads every time I wear it. I don't know if my store got a bad batch or what, but even after I exchanged it, I had the same problem...so disappointing.
B00MXU7JMC|5|Love these, very plushy and soft!
B00249ABE0|5|Great scrub pants that get better and softer with each washing. This was the second pair I bought and I'm still extremely satisfied! I'm 5'5&#34; and the pants hit a little above the heel of my tennis shoes- perfect length!
B00JRY8W9Q|3|Cute pajamas but I ordered the medium as directed by the size chart for 3T.  The shorts are HUGE....my daughter will certainly not be wearing these anytime soon.
B00KKO08QM|5|Love the shirt will buy again.
B00F9RNVM8|1|Once size fits all too big. Would slide down. Ripped about the second wear.
B00D1NT63A|5|I like it
B005LLNIIY|5|Worked great!
B000EB9ZN8|5|Exceptional.
B00R61V6PY|5|i must say i received my order here in cali one week after i order it andi am very pleased with my dress, im 5'4&#34; with a current weight 206 and i got a large and yes it fits very nice, i shall post a pic soon.  and will order from this site again.
B002R0F8JY|5|I love the soft material and the elastic band isn't as tight as a lot of other tights.  We will definitely buy these again.
B00OC87TXM|5|I loooooove it ! it's just perfect, long & warm !
B00FN2PZLY|5|It has a little elastic to it which makes it snug and very comfortable.  Received the correct product quickly with standard shipping
B0083QLQ8I|5|Its perfect for low back dresses.
B00HQ2UAF0|5|Gave as a gift - she loved it!
B00DQYWEDS|4|Good jacket.
B00IEDLS3S|5|I love this swimsuit. As an avid batman fan this was a great suit and different from the usual black and yellow ones. I have received many compliments.
B004DKSLXQ|4|OK,  So my initial review was that the battery died after a year or so and customer service was not taking care of me. That's not true anymore. In fact, they were incredibly kind and quite quick to send me a replacement for free. They DO care about their products so they also sent me a pre-stamped envelope to see what was the problem with the one I had.  Indeed no electronic device is perfect, but this companies customer service is! If you want a strapless heart monitor, this is the way to go. It's precise, it's comfortable, and if it goes bad, the company stands behind it.  Thank you!
B00910VFS6|4|I like this except the fact that its kinda short on me and tight in the calf area. pretty nice though
B00KHWGVH2|5|It was an excellent fit and so cute.
B005DMF7MG|3|I like the fit which is what I like most about NYDJ but the length was shorter than I expected.
B00PUXADYA|1|Style and fit are great. Pilling horribly after one wear and wash.
B000FBQ89Q|4|I'm 5'8 and 140lbs. I ordered an XS based on the reviews and found that it fit me a bit snug on the chest. I'll for sure order a small next time. I'm interning at a Veterinary Hospital so I wanted material that was durable even if it meant sacrificing the comfort of cotton material, and that's exactly what I got. Its actually not as stiff and uncomfortable as I thought it'd be. Its rather comfortable. I washed it once and it didn't shrink or get discolored. I ordered black. Oh and it doesn't require ironing either. The pockets are pretty big and spacey so that's convenient. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and will be placing another order soon :)
B005UM4UDG|3|Runs way too small...arms are too skinny but that's the look
B003TM4QBU|5|Quality of the pins were just fine for the price.  Given out a few as small presents and everyone loved them.  Worth the money
B000H8LHC0|5|I absolutely LOVE these jeans. It fits great, and doesn't have much stretch, so buy your size! I wish I had bought more of them.
B006WDFZMC|2|This was heavier than the reversible bucket hat and was a little small for me so I returned it.  I needed lightweight for hot weather in SC.
B00EOSKZ7M|5|This exceeded my expectations
B00UU4VN2K|4|I love it, although it was a little shorter than expected,other than that perfect! :)
B00CCY7K7S|5|I am an artist and very into being one of a kind and this shirt is one of many that definite does the trick.
B0044JMO8O|3|I bought a beatiful blazer from this seller a few months ago, and it was made of the best materials ever. Unfortunatelly, I couldn't wear it since it ran too big on me. Nonetheless, I have to recognize that it looked so nice, fashionable and fancy. Based on my previous experience, I ordered this pea coat in a small size (being that I always wear medium-sized clothes) but it didn't met my expectations: 1.- It's not definetely enough to face a harsh winter season 3.- It needs URGENTLY an upper buttom to close the flaps and cover the neck during extreme- cold- temperatures days 4.- It feels more synthetic than made of wool. 5.- Something weird happens with the shape: my body is muscular built, and think that waist and hip should be a little more close-fitting (looking for a \\"T\\" shape). If I had tried it on me before, I wouldn't have bought it. Anyways, I'll keep it for fall.
B00E1W9XXI|5|Its very nice and comfortaible.
B000QWBQTQ|5|i've got nothing but great things to say abot this product. I must warn you first though that this garment does takes disipline, but believe me it will pay off in the end both physically and mentally. Everywhere I turn people have been complimenting me on my figure and always asking if i've lost weight. Yes and no, although I have lost weight it's not drastic. I'm starting to be more comfortable with my figure now after giving birth four mionths ago. I wish I had had this the minute after I came home from the hospital! It gives you excellent back support and pushes up your bossom, while nipping in your waist! Its a must try for all new moms! I think I'm going to give this the new moms I know as a baby showering gift bonus!
B002SCJUAO|1|bought these boots for a Halloween costume, so I'm not too upset. bought 12 wides. they looked like 14 narrows. there is literally no padding in the insole. good for a few hours once. not wearable at all in real usage. wore these with padded wool socks to alleviate the pain a little.<br /><br />would not recommend.
B009VT1YCE|3|The color was nice and the fabric good too, I'll wear it soon but I'm  just looking for a matching blouse for it. Liverpool pants have good fitting, thank you
B008R50VFO|4|The shirt looks great and fits well.  But the cotton/polyester blend was a bit of a surprise to me.  Not the best choice for wearing where there is a lot of heat/humidity.  That said. I'm glad I have the shirt.
B001D21QMK|2|The ears were an uneven shape (one was more pointy than the other) and one of the beads came unraveled- lucky I liked them hanging straight better. It's less fluffy than it looks too, I had a friend do several touch ups to it to make it look better.
B00AETX6VC|5|This is a very pretty tunic...
B00V8YIVQM|4|its very thin
B00GOMDIMU|5|Love them. Great for winter very soft and warm
B00A23CMCE|5|Very good product, good material that looks resistant, ** not recommended for hot days! **<br />About the size:<br />reading other reviews i ordered a 34 (i usually wear a 32), they came out a little baggy but still wearable.<br />I recommend this product.
B00189KNS6|5|I ordered this costume for a themed, bachelorette party.  I was looking for something sexy, yet not too revealing because I am not happy with my legs, and I have large breasts.  This costume satisfied all of my issues.  My boobs and arms popped, so that was the sexy part!!  It covered my legs.  While it was fitting, it was not tight.  I was able to move around in a normal fashion.  The quality was good.  I never felt that it would come apart and I know that I will be able to wear it again.  I purchased the size that I normally wear.  I read reviews of other costumes and people complained that the size was not appropriate.  You will not have that problem here.
B00AYKTUGQ|1|Terrible. Looks like a dress you'd wear on the prairie.  Picture shows it short, but it's quite long (tea length) with a wrap skirt and shorter in front... The sleeves are very tailored - not like cute little cap sleeves. Very weird. Also enormous - the small was huge on me and I'm 5'6&#34; 125lbs. Definitely going back.
B0026RFFB4|5|I previously purchased a size 4 and 5 for my older boy. When you compare the garments, there is really only a tiny difference across each size. The size 5 is about a inch longer in length and a half an inch more in width. Since the elastic is very strong and stretch and shrink well, I am just going to have him wear his older brothers shorts. Material does not wrinkle and looks great even after many washings.
B00FJ2CPUW|4|Great socks! A lot of fun to wear...comfortable, a little snug, but overall a good fit. I'd recommend these socks for all occasions.
B00LBGPTLC|5|GREAT FIT, MY SON LOVES THEM.
B0075NCO5Y|4|I bought this Disney Pin to replace one from our last vacation at Disney World. My original was lost, and it was nice to be able to replace it. Whimsical Pin looks great on my ball cap.
B00DCDE760|3|I bought the socks for my wife because, well, socks need to be replaced every so often. These were a great price, but I have not been impressed with how well they have held up. Even after a few wear/wash cycles, the bottoms are starting to pill and fray. Would most likely not buy them again unless she needed some disposable socks for a trip or something like that.
B00G9KVIR4|5|Cheaper then in stores. Fit very well.
B004WQPJVS|5|In all seriousness, these are the best socks I have ever put on my feet. The best ever, greatest of all time.
B00M532RFG|2|it looks nice but the size is much bigger than what they claimed. now i have to pay someone to shorten it. i'm very unsatisfied that i have this great looking belt i cant wear..
B002K6F7C8|5|Fits in the cups,  a little snug under the armpit. Still the most comfortable and easy nursing bra I've tried. I have 3 and love them
B00LNS4IGA|3|Colors are good and fit is fine, but the print on the upper part is off-centered from the bill...just doesn't look right. But, for six bucks what the heck.
B0009UDENG|4|These Jeans are made of heavier denim than I was thinking, usually the indigo jeans Carpenter style are made of lighter weight Denim so I was pleasantly surprised that I got a little more than I bargained for. That being said i did go and get 2 pair of lighter indigo Carpenter style pants for my summers work.
B0067LQX6G|4|Not bad. Just dont expect high quality. It is cheap so the fabric is cheap.
B00325MTRC|5|loved it
B001MXGSL4|4|...although I suppose they need to have a little extra fabric to be one size fits all. Not a bad purchase for the price though
B004YD2W3W|5|Maybe one of my Favs for the wife to wear. Doesn't come with stockings, so buy fishnets;). Seems like it could adjust quite a bit, but it will stretch too. Durable and non itchy.
B00HS3P6SS|5|Beautiful!
B001IBHONG|3|It is really cute, as it is in the picture, but I guess I wasn't expecting it to be so big. I just feels like a big, bulky wallet that would go fine in a large purse, but I like to just grab my wallet and go sometimes, and this one won't fit in my coat pockets. The inside plastic holders fit cards just fine, but I ought they were for pictures, which they aren't, because wallet size pictures don't fit in them. Kind of bummed that I didn't start using it sooner so I had the option of returning it, but I let it sit in it's box on my desk for too long.
B005P240AE|4|This is a very nice supportive bra.  I have purchased it before and am always happy with how long they last.
B00JGY9CWI|1|I've been buying G-Star jeans, jackets, shirts and i know they run small and the quality is really good. But for this jean for some reasons went really hard after the 1st wash. All crumpled and you will need to iron it, 2x, to get it all straighten. I did 2nd wash and even added more fabric softener and still all crumpled after the drying.
B00H4YUV36|5|I can't wait for my baby girl to wear this. It is really cute. Made great and very stylish. Happy!
B0026Q561O|5|I purchased this for my groomsmen and was happy with the look, quality, and size of the tie. They looked sharp.
B00CGMKIYI|3|Nice but too small for a 4 month old baby ... Most likely due to very small diaper area. Odd
B00NO6YB20|1|runs way too small.  do not recommend.
B00F2V7FHI|4|Still a great product
B005DIIQSW|4|These jeans firt great and look great!! The material isnt what it used to be when I was a kid; the material is thinner for sure than the good ole days back when they made stuff to really last; i have had some issues with the yellow stitching coming undone, which is pretrty crazy for a brand new pair of pants; the jeans themselves are fairly sturdy; i hope the stitching holds up cuz I really like the look, the feel, and the fit these jeans offerr. I would buy these again.
B00127YAM4|5|This bra is amazing. I am typically a 40G. I ordered a 42FF and it fits like a dream. This was ordered to work with a dance costume. I have no &#34;jiggle&#34; and my boobs actually stay where they belong. It is helpful to have someone help you to put it on.
B003HC8RVC|5|Love them!
B0036ZU8YY|5|Great product and service!  This belt is of great quality and an incredible value at this price.  The belt I order was one size too small. I returned it and received an exchange for the size that I need at no charge.  You can't go wrong buying from Dangrous Threads!
B00CFF66Y2|5|not as thick as i thought it maybe , but great fit and perfect for under her winter coat, this will make a great gift for my kid!
B00OM86LZO|5|My daughter loves them! She tells me they are so comfy! (not too think, not too thin!)
B0007IBYO6|5|I happen to like the fact that the oxford shirts are actually 58/42 and not 100% cotton. I wear them to the gym three times a week. I've found that 100% cotton shirts shrink and 100% polyester stinks, but the blend works great. They hold up well too. I also get the tank tops and sleeveless T's on occasion. I have purchased more expensive ($20+) name brand workout shirts in the past, but have come back to Russell. For $8 delivered to your front door with amazon prime, what more could you want? The value is hard to beat!
B0015E8JLM|1|Perhaps I am a bit obtuse, but what exactly is this design supposed to be? It is truly bizarre. It appears to be Hillary on the can, or \\"throne\\" reading about \\"getting black\\" and imagining the number 1,000,001...I'm lost. Am I not seeing the forest for the trees? My husband believes that this is somehow referring to the million man march. If so that makes this even more confusing. Gotta love the weird Amazon Marketplace vendors...
B0027YUNLI|1|I NORMALLY WEAR SIZE 12-14 SO I ORDERED IT THE 2XL, ANDIT  DIDNT FIT. I GAVE IT TO MY MOM WHO WEARS SIZE 6, AND IT FIT PERFECT. THE SIZING OF THIS PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY WRONG. DONT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE  WIDE HIPS AND BIG BUT.
B00OTHKXRA|5|Very nice shorts.  A little on the long side and seems to run big.  I normally wear a 10 regular in womens sizing.  I could easily wear an 8 in these shorts.  The fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable.  I would buy them again.  But in an 8.
B001BSDDG8|3|Little bit tight on the thighs but other than that they were great fit wish I could pick a size thought
B00MA9L0B2|2|This dress is not what I expected at all. I expected what was in the picture. Unfortunately it's not as elegant as I had hoped, it's pretty, but it's not the picture perfect dress. The dress is not short as short as I had thought.  Another thing is the description says that customization is free of charges and that custom dresses can be returned, that is a false statement because I had asked to add a zipper after reading that customization was free, I was asked by the seller to pay ten more dollars and that the dress will no longer be returnable due to the zipper being added. So overall I would not purchase this ever again and I am unsure if I'll ever wear it.
B00CLUMZUK|4|A great purchase! Fits right and super cozy however not as warm as I hoped
B00FFYMYOQ|5|I love the sweater!<br />It fits perfect, I'm a pretty average sized bloke, was a bit nervous about the size.<br />I'm a 38r, 34-35 arm, and 16.5 neck. This fits perfect everywhere, not to tight around the neck, the sleeves break at the break (ball) of your wrist, take that as you will!<br /><br />Will look for more nice clothing items from H2H! :)
B00DF93FWI|4|The print was bigger in real life which was good but the colors are definitely darker in the picture but it doesn't bother me that much
B00J4NQX4Q|5|Nice quality.  My daughter loves these!  She normally wears a girls size 10 but ordered a large based on past experience with Capezio sizing...fits great!
B00JJI1FTE|4|I ordered my onesie the day after Christmas (12/26) and just got it this afternoon (1/20). I'm about 5'10 1/2 and I ordered a large; it fits my legs perfectly and the arms are just a littttttle short but not short enough to bother me. It is SUPER soft and warm, which I love, and even has a zipper by the butt so that you don't have to take the whole thing off just to use the bathroom, which is really convenient. However, I did have two problems. First, there is a small hole in the seams by the bum, but this is easily fixed. Second, and the more frustrating problem, is that the face is not as cute as it looks in the picture. The mouth and nose are a little awkwardly shaped, and the eyes are not as big as I expected them to be, so the tiger's face looks a little more grumpy than it does cute, so that was a little disappointing. Despite that, I'd say that, overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
B00K5PE0HY|1|I ordered this jacket and received a freakin Little Buddy Heater!!!! ugh,,,,
B001PU9A9Q|5|I have tried several different styles of pasties with zero success.  These things though are fantastic.  The color is great, the edges are super smooth.  It looks like I'm wearing a bra with these things on.  A rinse with a little soap after wearing they're good as new the next day.  Great product!
B00D8I7OBE|3|I didn't like the thin fabric and it was a bit short for my liking. Made me look pregnant. It would be a great maternity top. I sent it back.
B00E89FO0U|5|It is really great quality jacket. I used this jacket on a ski holiday at Bansko (Bulgaria). The weather wasn’t too cold (temp -11 to 0 ), snow, rain and wind from time to time (but strong and cold wind at the summit). I used it with two layers of thermal shirt‬‏ beneath the jacket and felt great, maybe too warm from time to time. On sunny days the armpits vent and the thumb holes in the sleeves are helpful. This is not the Jacket for rough condition, but in moderate conditions it will keep you dry with no doubt, even after some falls.<br /> The Jacket Looks great, like a sweatshirt, very-very light so it is nice and cool also on apr&egrave;s-ski .Mine is the green one, so my friends can spot me easily on the mountain<br />I think for that quality price tag is good. Please note It fits a little big, so whatever you do, don't by a size larger than you'd normally. I’m 180 cm, about 77 kg, so size large is perfect  (maybe too long on sleeves and skirt for 1-2 cm). If I can improve anything is an addition of affront secure pocket like you can see in many snowboard/ski suits.
B00286LCQ0|1|If you have a large chest and are looking for support in your bathing suit, these will NOT help you. They are super tiny and barely offer any coverage at all.
B001466TOA|5|The pin is a good size as well as the detail<br />Of the pin. The colors and motto portion of the<br />Pin is impressive. It's about time we can find pins with the 4th AD, how about patches.
B00DRKKJX8|1|I was disappointed.  The fabric is quite thin and the skirt is way too short for a maxi.  I am 5'7'' and 125 pounds.  The quality is poor.
B00JDCQK3C|2|It did nothing for my figure, returning item
B00MUIE38U|3|Fits too small but over all not bad.
B0009GFED8|1|It's too big idk what to tell you
B005F9ER1E|5|Present for my giraffe loving girlfriend and she absolutely loved them! they fit her great and looked great as well
B00H4ZFX3I|1|This product was so small, though it advertised &#34;woman's&#34; sizes, that size 8 would barely fit a 10 year old.  Now I find there is a restocking fee, and I don't think I will find anything from this company that is acceptable.  Not happy!!
B00JO9ZZAS|5|As expected
B004FO93DW|5|Fast delivery and quality fabric the design is printed well on the shirt very happy with the shirt. one of my fav bands great shirt a little thick cotton/fabric but quality print.
B00OIGLZXI|5|Super cute. Guys love them.
B00CN7VT9O|4|Nice pants but too small
B00NGH30YC|4|The item is very pretty, nice soft fabric and fit just great. However, it's a bit on a thinner side, which is fine by me. But if you are looking for something that's thick and warm enough to be outside for a long period of time, this may not be for you. I am definitely keeping it.
B002JIO3FO|5|nice
B00EET4SHE|5|I got this for my husband.  We ordered according to the size chart and it fit great.  If anything, maybe a bit loose, but not that it's obvious.<br />Love it!
B00CL0KW1Y|5|I love this dress . Its a little too big but I'm wearing a sash so its fine . I love the lenght and I was told i look innconent with it on , so thats a plus . Over all it was a great buy ..
B00BXIQ156|4|These are extremely comfortable. I was worried the waist band would be stiff, but it's not. It's very flexible. The shorts are light and airy. Perfect for a hot day like today. I'm happy that I was able to find longer short. Most shorts seem to be way too short. My only complaint is that the fit isn't too flattering. I didn't expect it to be though. It sort of looks like a skirt with how it flairs out. I bought it just for comfort and around the house though so I am really happy. They're more comfortable and lighter than I thought they'd be.
B00NBO8FB8|3|Small for a 3x, I am a 1x and it was tight.  A 3x was tight
B002HJ377A|4|Me in normal clothes= inadequate human being. Me in The Mountain Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee Shirt=Warrior, philosopher, poet, king.
B00E1YRL8K|5|My daughter loved it!
B004BDOPUS|3|These shirts were great although the colors are a brighter than I thought. A large fit great on me right out of the package then I washed them and they shrunk a little to much. I didn't get xl because I have a couple xl and after many washes they are still too big so I went with a large i wish they would come pre washed because i loved the way they fit right out of package. The shirts came down more now they rest at my belt. It seems i need a shirt in the middle of large and xl that would be perfect.
B0032AMVZ2|5|we saw this at our local wholefoods market and my wife loved it.. but for $29.99, i was sure we can find it elsewhere cheaper and indeed we did on amazon.  thanks~
B000UO4NGS|5|Best fangs I've had outside of complete customs. Solid fit, realistic look.
B0095SQB9C|3|Super cute shirt and I got a great deal on it. However, It runs BIG. I ordered in my normal size 4 and probably could have done a 2 or even a 0 for it to look as cute as it does in the picture. It just hangs off me. Looks sloppy actually.  Now I have a decision to make. Do I keep it or send it back?
B003IASMCC|1|not sized correctly
B00NHU4OVG|5|This sweater is exactly what I thought it would be - the length is how it is shown and looks to be made well - great for the Spring if you need something lighter or right now in the office over a T.  I chose this color over the black/white  because I can wear it 3 out of the 4 seasons.
B00E6XUYEE|5|Material is ok for the price. However, size is huge.
B004CO78HS|2|Inside the straps there are pieces of fabric that rub skin raw. I had to sew them under. One of these days manufacturers will make a perfect bra.
B00IV52GV2|1|Received wrong swimsuit, but husband packed it before I knew it was wrong. Got on cruise ship, unpacked and realized I had a two piece bright Pink, Blue and Orange Flowered suit with bikini bottom. Tried to wear it as it was all I had, but ended up having to buy one on the ship. I'm 60 years old, wanted something to be comfortable in on the beach. Bikini bottoms are not for me! Not sure how they made the color mistake to begin with, but to send a two piece really has me baffled. Will not be ordering from them again.
B00MV6IY5Y|5|Adorable! Fit my newborn, and I love that they are interchangeable too!
B00GBK6RJG|1|This item is nothing how it looks on the picture. The feather sticks up, it doesn't  wrap around the babies head and its of poor quality.  It took a total of 3 weeks for me to finally receive it and its because it comes from china. I would not recommend  this product.
B00E5Q29L8|5|So comfortable
B0007CKS0I|4|I ordered these jeans to use on an upcoming hunting trip.  I placed the order and was given a delivery window that should have put them in my possession on time -- but they arrived too late!  Anyway, I like the jeans, they fit well, although the sizes do run small in the waist, (if you wear a 33 waist normally, order a 34 in these).  The material and construction appear to be very good.  However, I will have to wait until my next hunting trip see how they hold up to the brush and briers.
B00FL3YSCW|4|These were very pretty on my wife,  though a bit on the small side. Very durable thickness.
B001UK5XPG|5|These look really authentic. I got these for my nephews and they love them!
B00ONI1DTW|5|Loved it ! It looks great on my boyfriend
B00N8LB610|4|Can;t wait to wear this dress to a special occasion coming up. Was pleasantly surprised by the slip built into the dress. Love it.
B00R0RE5HU|5|Love it
B008G4F6WY|5|I got this shirt for my husband. It is very good quality and the sizing is just right. He loves it! I would purchase from this company again.
B00IIANZWE|2|Too boxy for my baby.  Material was soft but quite thick!  A cute design for Halloween and looked great in a pumpkin photo shoot.
B00NO4I7Z4|4|Great
B00PY4WJC4|5|This is one of the best sports bras I have found.  I have small ribs with large breasts, and most sports bras are useless for me.  I bought this in the 34DDD size and it is great.  Very supportive in the band, and when I use the straps in the crossed position, the girls stay put through running, jump rope, burpees, etc.  As a bonus, it actually makes my breasts look great thanks to the underwire cups.  No uni-boob going on here.
B000E288BM|1|really? THIS is what we want to be advertising? To kill innocent creatures? I'm ashamed of anyone who would wear/sell/buy or even advertise this product (Hem hem AMAZON) this is offensive and cruel and plain idiotic.
B00CZ7TVTM|4|Good support and comfort.
B005979XU2|3|I have quite a collection of beanies which I use when I work out.  Needing a purple one (I like a lot of color) I found this on Amazon.  The \\"grenade\\" made it seem fitting for working out.  The beanie however, is a little on the small side.  I wear 7 3/8 sized hats, and usually fit into medium sized headgear.  This beanie was closer to a watch cap, as it needed to be stretched to fit past my ears.  If you un-cuff it, it is plenty long enough, but then is just a purple beanie.  The shape is good, and doesn't have the \\"corners\\" as much as many other cheap beanies.  If it was a little larger, it would easily be 4 or 5/5.
B009NQFNHC|5|Just what I need when I want a little something to keep my feet and ankles happy.  They wear well.
B008AHJ35I|4|Arrived quickly and the size is about right. Its belt strap system ensures that it does not snag during active outdoor activities.
B00CSJ4Y12|5|good
B002HJ3D9C|5|Wife purchased these to wear with a leg brace. Helps to prevent chafing. Bonus was that they are comfortable, and wick moisture nicely. If you have a need for a knee sock, buy these with confidence.
B0091KCMRE|1|The cut and sowing of the toe is strange . The material is rough. The picture shows a shiny material and it was not as shiny as expected.
B00AEL3UTS|4|friend as a joke but she really likes it. Her humor is as bad as mine. Should have gotten one, too.
B00IAUG2HC|5|Great and fast
B002NPCIMS|1|I needed undershirts to help keep my 21 month old son warm this winter now that he is to big for onesies. These are very think and not soft at all. Also they shrank after one wash! I threw them away and got some from Carters instead!
B00A2YR6P6|5|my son loves his hoodie<br />came a day early and<br />my son hasnt taken it off since...<br />awesome nice material
B00GSY6RVI|5|I'm 5'3&#34; and it hits right at the knee...I have a 36&#34; bust and a small fits perfectly. This dress drapes nicely, has a tie back, looks great and will be perfect for when it heats up. I wish I could buy 10 of these, this is the perfect everyday sundress.
B005SZ02N2|5|I bought it to wear to a pink party for a friends cancer. Fit great super cute everyone loved it
B003WEQMZI|1|No form. Poor fit.
B001UHMZOQ|5|Bought two pair.  My son loves these.  I was going to purchase a third pair, all sold out, for his size and color.  Hope they will have more available soon.  These are all he wears this summer.
B001K8JWUU|1|THE PICTURE SHOWED A LIGHT YELLOW SWIMSUIT....NOT THIS THING!  THIS IS THE BRIGHTEST NEON YELLOW EVER SEEN.  IF YOU WANT TO BLIND SOMEONE, THIS IS THE SUIT TO BUY
B00GPBEYT6|5|My daughter is wearing these with her uniforms she loved them and they came early
B004C2VIYY|5|Beautiful set of bows. My 8month old daughter has been wearing them for the past month and the velvet covered clip is great for her delicate hair. I assume it's comfortable as she doesn't even notice the bow while the rest of us can go &#34;Awww&#34; over how adorably girly she looks!
B001HK804K|4|It's exactly what it states, just wish they placed it near a model for size comparison.  It's too small for my head, but fits my sons perfectly.
B00944F472|5|While the 'smallness' of the package and product itself is worrisome, actually trying and wearing this cami is beyond pleasant.  Love the freedom it represents -- by just wearing something so simple, so easy.  But for me it is still warmer that I prefer in the hot hot summer months.
B009ZP06TG|3|Kind of cheap, but I just used it to jazz up a brown leather bag by tieing it around the handle.  Worked well for the purpose.
B000T8LLXI|1|I ordered this jacket and will be sending it back.<br />It's not a bad jacket, but alittle light for what I was<br />looking for and didn't like the material of it either.<br />The service was fast from Woolrich thou.<br />Not real Denim, if your looking for denim this isn't it.
B002EAAS88|2|My 4 yr old wears it to church occasionally (he has a huge tie collection and I needed one w/o stripes). The color is great and it's sturdy material, but the clip broke and it's useless now.
B002ECF3CC|4|Great pants! They fit well and they the perfect weight. Not too thin or thick.
B004A7XXRG|5|i will recommend to everybody who likes natural , breathable feeling panties.
B00C0FUVAM|3|I usually wear sizes 36-38 and ordered size m. I put the strings in looses as possible, and manage to close the zipper in waist but couldnt pull it all the way up. Also it looks like it doesnt have enought room for breasts.<br /><br />Also, in description it doesnt say anywhere that it has zipper on the side.<br /><br />Its beautiful, too bad I have to send it back.
B0058CUBH2|5|good looking and very fit
B00PHMD3LO|5|excellent
B0117XK9VS|5|Awesome shirts. Real comfortable and the fit is really nice! Great customer service. Already placed another order!
B00IYNGDKQ|5|The quality is perfect.
B009GL5XCE|4|These tops are nice and they do fit well, BUT they do not flatter my XL body shape at all. They are long, and show every detail about my tummy, which I do not wish to show at this time. They hug your body, so if you have some excess tummy, rolls, etc, don't buy unless you're ok with showing it off. I just had a baby and will have to lose a little weight before I feel comfortable wearing these. Besides that, I like the colors and the material seems decent! I think these would be flattering on me if I lost about 30 lbs.
B007CAKBKA|1|I have a lot of &#34;one size fits all&#34; lingerie type things. This is too small to go under that category. I'm a size 4-6 depending on the store, and I am VERY picky about how snug something fits. I don't like things to feel like they are digging into me at all, which is why I am very partial to lace. The waist doesn't stretch like lace typically does. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone bigger than a size 2. Dreamgirls has a similar item that will fit better, go for that.
B00079ULP8|5|I needed a work shirt and this shirt works perfectly<br />Looks good.<br />Easy to clean.<br />Actually freakin fits!<br />really soft material.
B000BBMD4O|5|I was looking for a basic water shoe, but this is better. It's a great shoe for Florida water sports, from canoeing to sailing. Perfect for when the feet have to be on the ocean floor. It protects in comfort.
B00M3FEQEQ|5|My husband looks like a model. He is tall with distinct, yet elegant muscle mass. He normally wears Large, but his FC size is XL. This coat looks much nicer on my husband than this model in the picture. Nice coat,
B00XKLDDUU|3|I had to give to my younger son.  it was a 3XL that fit like an Extra Large
B00E1LAOGE|1|that fraud with these blouses, too small, I did not like, I rejoin my money. deception sizes, serve to anorexic or girls.<br />no purchase is a fraud, a scam !!! and do not return the money
B00HF4NCE0|4|Very cute! Perfect for Valentines Day.  Shipping was free and it took a while to get.
B00GJ7XKUA|4|nice product
B00BS3JVOY|5|This dress fits as expected. I use to be a size 14 but I've lost some weight and didn't feel comfortable getting a smaller size because I didn't want to risk it. I've gotten it altered and fits like a glove!!! I recommend getting your actual size. Can't wait to wear it!
B00AW5QFK2|5|These workout shorts fit great. I would definitely recommend them. The price is reasonable and the product was quality. Great job Russell athletics
B000VK5VNU|2|More like a hybrid. The cups are not as supportive as I'd like for a sports bra. Also,  not as comfy and flexibly-soft as the other sports bras I've worn, but those were made by athletic wear companies. Thought I'd see what this was like. I've decided to stick with the ones I normally wear.
B00QQYOU8C|5|Love it! I am 5&#34;2 and 125 lbs. I have had two kids so my stomach isn't that sexy flat stomach. This has given me back my self confidence to wear shirts other then my husbands t-shirts!
B008GRB3IC|5|I first purchased one of these to hold only my ID badge to scan in and out at work without digging through my purse.  It worked really well for that purpose, but now I have purchased several more due to their great utility!  They hold a driver's license or other photo ID and a stack of cards about 1/2 inch thick and are still tall enough to hold a few dollar bills folded in half.  I have given these to all of the girls in my family who have gone off to college in the past few years, and they have all told me how well they have worked out for them--all they do is clip their keys to the key ring, stuff in their ID, a bank card, and a little cash, and they don't have to lug a massive bag around or worry about misplacing a purse.  I will definitely be buying more of these as the holidays approach and absolutely would recommend them to anyone looking for a fun, practical gift for a new college girl.
B00HVTMT7K|5|Birthday present for kid and he loved it.
B00O8ST0LU|3|Did send tie for the corset...when I finally got the tie the dress was to small...beautiful dress
B00N24L8Z2|1|Why is this item allowed to be sold on Amazon? Che is the face of murder, racism, and homophobia. I guess all that matters to the Left is that he is the darling poster boy for thier beloved Communism.
B004E2WOFE|5|These mittens are the best!  Good quality and they keep my hands warm!  I just ordered another pair in different color
B00H40XCJU|3|The brown hat fitted well.  However the color was off, it was a faded color brown and not a true deep brown like dthe old hat i have which still has a deepo color then the one i just purchased.
B0042L6D90|5|I bought this for a cruise that a large group of us were going on. It looked amazing! All of the crew on the ship kept saluting me and calling me captain which made it even more fun!
B007UWFVEG|5|This is probably my 4th pair of these jeans. I like the dark color and they fit great. I bought these to replace a pair that died after 4 years.
B00G2GMBD0|1|Too small and could not even fit me at all...  I bought L but it should be M if not smaller.  Have to return it
B008DFBES6|5|These jeans are gook looking.  And looks good on my granddaughter.  If she loves them, so do I. Love the design.
B005HILJWI|4|Soft and supportive.  We have tried them on my son, but not left them as he isn't quite there yet... He still is having trouble pulling pants up/down.  So, this is why I bought these to see what they were like in the waste.  Definitely go by the weight, not your child's clothes size... They are a little tall on his waste, but for us this will be good... and they fit but are not tight.  lol - they kinda remind me of maternity underwear in that you don't feel the elastic, but it works and holds them up.  Shipper was quick.
B002NPCJ5E|5|The material is to die for its very soft and nice and the colours are vibrant only disadvantage is that is a bit small
B007KFZGV6|5|love it
B002USCHME|5|This sleeper is super soft and looks adorable! It is high quality and fits just right. I love it so much I will be sad when she outgrows it.
B00HPN88C2|5|Very cute and comfy, does tend to pill quickly, though.
B00475V86Y|5|I've been wearing these gloves in below zero weather ever since they were received and very happy with them.  Fit is snug, but that makes it easier to pick things up, etc.  Product came much sooner than advised and in excellent condition.
B003L7WS54|5|I'm in love...
B009F987QQ|5|very cute pj top. Soft, and true to size. my daughter loves this top wth the matching shorts we bought with them
B00KS6NJBS|3|They looked really nice but they were  a LOT smaller than we thought they would be.  Had to send them back for a refund.
B00MCWDTB6|4|great quality and very cute as expected will buy this brand again
B003XGY6XA|5|very nice medium weight sweat. inside is quite soft. good price  also.
B00ARAPRBK|5|This was a surprise. I love it. But only after watching a YouTube demo on how to wear it did I fully appreciate it. I followed the instructions and put it on. So so cute. Highly recommend if you want something a little different from the typical size scarf.
B00J5MX1AK|5|It is hard to find a hat that she will wear out in the sun, but this one works.  The fact that it is reversible helps as she can pick the hat for the mood she is in without buying a second hat.
B007ZTOEX8|3|Its black not blue just fyi!
B00DF0XTQY|3|It was an absolutely beautiful dress but was a little larger than I expected and the zipper was broken
B002LTLP3Y|4|I am only 5' 5 1/2&#34; and expected that some alteration would be needed.  But no, the elastic on the pant legs can moved up so that the leg hangs down at an appropriate level, the shirt is fine, a concern for a woman.  I am happy and will begin Tai Chi Instruction early in 2015 at a very successful loacal yoga studio.  I will share my positive experience with you with the attendees.  Customer Serice was excellant in navigating me through the online process.  You will hear from me again.
B00PCW298W|5|Great shirt for great value!
B008R7FCL0|1|I ordered a size XLarge. Got the shirt the next day. I tried it on, couldn't even button it. It was too small. Returned the shirt.  Good quality shirt though. I regret that it was mis-sized
B006CQC4R8|5|These are soft, the color is fast and they fit right and will last for the next year then into hand-me-down phase.
B00KIXDFGK|1|Okay, so here's the deal– I'm usually a 2 or 3 x.  Bought this piece in 4x, seeing how things tend to run small.  Couldn't even get this cheap piece of crap over my head.  I'm so disgusted and disappointed with this dress.  I won't be buying anymore clothing on Amazon, ever again.  Worst fifty dollars I ever spent.
B00MFJ9802|5|I got the one-size fits all and I loved it. It was the perfect size.  I'm 130 and 5'1 and not big on top. I'm not sure if it would fit someone with more going on- on top but the bottom was fine. Everything was as I expected the bunny ears and all.  The only thing I have to say is that the bunny ball/tail was on my back and not my butt 😂 and it was see-though, which I didn't expect But that made it even more sexy.
B008MV6AQM|4|Pros: Very cute, a great way to be unique and express yourself with your clothing, very comfortable, quick shipping, & inexpensive.<br /><br />Cons: Kind of thin, mainly for petite sized people, & fabric is see-through.<br /><br />Since they are see-through, I decided whenever I wear them to put another pair of thin tights or leggings under these leggings.
B00H9YUB22|5|These are very nice socks...I would highly recommend these for any girls that like the Walking Dead.
B000CBUIYK|5|My husband and kids love these socks. They love how they fit like a glove and don't move around when you put your shoe on.
B008M5S09S|5|For my husband
B00KKGJLNQ|4|It's cute and fits, but it's not a snug fit. I wear a size small and it's a little big in the back. You can't adjust it cause the back is stretchy. I bet it'd fit perfect for someone who wears a medium though. Nice buy. It gets 4 stars for being a little too big though and non adjustable.
B008BT51JC|5|I tried these on in a department store yesterday-I am a full-figured 14/16 girl, 5'6\\" tall, 47\\" hip and I have a tummy, and the 14 fit me great, so they must run a bit big. The inseam seemed to be about 35\\", as I had to roll them two inches at the bottom and usually a 32\\"-33\\" inseam is perfect on me. No muffin top, really comfortable. I tried on about 20 pairs of jeans in the plus-size department and the regular department and these were the only ones that worked.
B00553XKW2|5|I purchased the Glamorise bra because it is my favorite brand. I love Glamorise because it provides support with no underwire, it has wide shoulder bands, it is just very comfortable, and beautiful at the same time. I enjoy wearing Glomorise bras.
B00GWETGDA|4|The dress did not fit. But overall the quality has no minor issues. Nice dress. My wife gave the dress to her sister
B00PEK3E8G|5|Wonderful, sized as expected. I bought a red one, medium, arrived quickly and in a neat package. No damage. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from ordering this gorgeous dress!
B00D5S1GTI|3|I liked it, but I order a little bit small, I think my granddaughter grew too fast, by the way I ordered two by mistake and I only need one, my fault
B00ELMLAXE|4|I like the look and quality but I have to exchange it for a larger size.  My daughter is 22 pounds and I ordered the 12-18 month size based on the size  chart but it was too tight around her belly and the bottoms were too small.
B00IPDV6Y8|4|Would've been nice if it was a foam sword rather than plastic, since it's going to a child, they'll probably swing it around and it could hit someone and hurt them. Other than that, everything was great!
B00BVX7RLU|5|I'm really happy with this swim suit , its good quality and is super cute. Make sure you order the size by their size chart and you will be fine. Im 5ft 3in with a 32B bust and I fit into the US small perfectly.
B00I2T1GWC|3|Dont know yet.  It's a gift to someone else.,
B00JM2WQPE|5|Really hello kitty. It is nice it fits well as expected
B005GLJFZE|5|I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this merchandise especially for the price. I have seen others in stores that were more expensive yet not near as nice.
B004Z8TXF6|5|My wife has been looking for this style of bath caddy for awhile and she likes this one very much.  Made very well, and should be, because it is not cheap to buy!  But you get what you pay for it I guess!
B006L7U87Q|5|These mix socks was nice for stocking stuffers....
B003F2D534|5|These socks, like all the Trumpettes I've purchased (for boys and girls), run small. If your baby has bigger feet, these may last only six to nine months, not a whole year. However, for those months, you will get so many compliments on these adorable socks. I prefer the Jitterbug Jenny style to the ballerina style with little bows since those sometimes fall off. The lace trim on the Jitterbugs is such a sweet touch and the colors coordinate easily with little girls' outfits. A great buy!
B00CIZLS74|1|diaper under your arm
B006UESJQM|5|nice socks, but you only get one pair for the price
B00HVL2P4U|5|Sturdily made, attractive but not overstated, and with just the right amount of grouped pockets/dividers, spread evenly throughout.
B00INIZ72C|5|nice fabric..
B00IV6GZRM|5|Awesome fit! Purchased for wedding and it is true to size. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B00D3ZT3ZW|5|Loved this gift for their little guy and next year it will pass down to his little sibling 11 months younger. Well made, warm fits great with grow room.
B00F2ZX500|5|I love this hat! It's soft and warm. I wear it in the Seattle rain and stay pretty dry too.
B00FYJEFC6|4|FINE
B00M5W3RI8|4|Exactly look like the picture
B002MPQKYQ|5|I'm very pleased with these.  I actually bought two: the chocolate, and the black & white.  They're both quite handsome in design, and very soft.  What else?  They're lightweight.  They're not bulky.  I haven't tested their warmth, but I don't know how I'd describe how they stack up against other scarves anyway.
B00592VANA|5|I love the design. Fit very well for my 2 years daughter.
B00E9R0HUS|3|I have worn Playtex 18 hour bras for years, so I thought I would try this one since I had been looking for a chocolate brown bra, however I was somewhat disappointed that there was' nt the support in this bra that all my other Playtex bras have. I will keep it but it's somewhat &#34;misleading&#34; for an 18 hour bra to be advertised as such and failing to have the support, other than that the bra is comfortable and washes well.
B00006CFCX|3|It will fit most any size, but I did not care for the hot pink that goes all the way down the front.  The cartoon character has pink but it does not show as much.  I ended up with the movie Maleficent costume and it worked out REALLY well!  So it depends on if you want to be cartoon character Maleficent or movie Maleficent!  I myself preferred movie.
B00HUS75CQ|4|Ordered 2 different styles, thinking they were the same cut. One is lower than the other and I don't really care for that style.
B005FQQQIO|5|Highly recommend the quality of said product and the shipper due to the efficiency in their shipment. Thanks again! ~Lori
B008KIY5N2|3|Average shirt at best. The colors look fine, but the sizing is way off. He's swimming in a large. Going to have to tailor myself. Ugh.
B006LHMWJ8|5|Got this for my sexy hubby for Valentine's Day.  He works out like a madman and these looked great on him.
B005MZZ634|5|On time delivery. Great product.
B0045KFBYQ|5|This bra has been very comfortable for me.  The coverage is perfect and the range of sizes available is great.  So if you have the right measurements it will fit perfectly. I will be buying a second one soon!
B00IXJFCEY|5|This is perfect, its comfortable and easy to use.
B0097SHHJI|1|I feel like most reviews here are overly generous because this mask is so cheap.<br /><br />1. It's too big. I had to cut some off the neck and put a sponge on my head to make it drape correctly. Also, there is no velcro in the back to make it fit better. My head is about 24 inches.<br />2. The picture listed is a bit misleading - the mask has no gray or shading tints. In the light it's going to look bone white and glossy. In the dark it looks good if you can get it to fit right.<br />3. The hair isn't fantastic. It needs to be modded.<br /><br />I understand that corners must be cut to make a mass market mask like this, but that's the truth of it.<br /><br />Those are my main gripes, but for 40-50 bucks it's not terrible. It's a good start to an killer outfit and great for modding, but be warned it's not perfect.<br /><br />Update:<br />I would suggest you don't support TOTS. The owner of this company Chris attacks other uses on michealmyers.net and calls them &#34;newbs&#34; and &#34;rookies&#34; like he is 12 years old.<br /><br />I was kind of shocked by the immaturity of a business owner on a public forum.
B003IM1K2Y|5|I got the creme colored dress and I absolutely love it! although i didn't realize it was compleately see-through, but i found a beige slip to wear underneath it and wore it out...and let me tell you, i looked like a million dollars and i got alot of compliments on the dress. a big hit!!!
B00J2WIDXS|5|I just love this wallet  I have been looking for one like this forever....Its awesome
B00AZ8CF5U|4|Gold toe makes solid products and this one is no exception. Fits right, color is true to picture. Happy with the purchase. FYI they are marked as casual socks but they are thinner like dress socks.
B00VQBJOQI|5|I received my lovely wallet and it is absolutely perfect! The wallet arrived securely wrapped in thick plastic and the stitching is exquisite. There really is nothing like the smell of real leather. This wallet has plenty of room for everything I need and is very sturdy while still soft to the touch. I cannot rave enough about this product and highly recommend it. It has amazing quality and would make a wonderful Mother's Day or graduation gift for that special person! :)
B008Q7EJVA|5|Great for light workouts, such as yoga and dancing. Also great for wearing out with sandals or sneakers. You can sleep in them too.
B009Z7FDLU|5|Amazing fit it shapes the body curves but not too much and the material keeps on going up I have to pull it down every now and then
B00368CL6Y|2|The bra was too small. The back clasp was hard to fasten. I need soemthing with more support..It may work for smaller breasted women.
B008EYGQW0|1|The sweater was huge and did not even wear it. I will be returning it right away. Will not be ordering these again.
B008WD94UO|4|Loved it!!  Gave it 4 stars because the tip of the tower was impossible to put together without frustration, but the end result was just what I wanted.  We had 24 guests at a super long table, so I purchased 2 in black for the sides and the center one in pink.
B00EHP2T3K|3|Pros:  It's warm!<br /><br />Cons:  It shrinks, and attracts pet hair like a magnet!
B009WRRUAU|5|Fits great, feels nice and warm
B00G6ZU39G|5|Good fit, good color, good design.  My 15 year old loved these pants.  She wore them right out of the box.
B004UUDY1S|4|Need to show recommended hight for all one-size-fits-all costumes. I look like a flying squirrel I'm my costume!
B00FXLLDF2|2|We are not built the same as asians over here, apparently. I can barely fit my junk in the largest size they make, and the leg holes are like tourniquets.
B000N8X2ZO|2|Neck area needs a top button. Well made but a very boxy fit. Don't really like the Dickies logo tag that shows on the shirt tail when worn out, as it is designed to be. Ordered white as well, and at least the black looks a little better.
B00NOFLB7Y|3|I read the reviews prior to ordering, I normally wear a medium or a small in US sizes so I ordered a Large of this shirt. It is pretty cute but I would have preferred it to fit even looser than it is on me. It is sheer so with a tank top underneath it looks good. Also the seam at the top of the shoulders is scrunched a bit so it has just a slight poof to it, which I personally don't like.
B004RJRAVW|5|Bought for my daughter. She loves them!! Wears them all the time at home. She would probably wear them to school if I allowed her to!
B00968D93M|1|The dress was extremely two small, received it full of wrinkles it was made poorly (seam work was terrible) the material was so cheap even if you sent to be professionally pressed it would have made no difference. I had a difficult time returning it to Great Brittan - and not directly to Amazon thats the big problem. They charged me $16.75 to return it it 1st class with no idea when it would be delivered or $48.00 to send priority. Do the math so I am in the hole for returning the dress.
B00E8CNBJI|5|Love the color, get tons of compliments.  Wore it to a birthday party, can be dressy or casual.  Wear it during the day or out on the town.
B00CC4CXUC|5|Looked amazing on my wife quality material great product...This item is a great value for the price it's extraordinary beautifully made and great quality will buy again from this seller.
B0061Q32Z2|5|Great price and super fast delivery. It beat the expected date. Not to mention looks great.
B005ZT8WQK|5|I bought these for our 4 year daughter who is average height for her age.  They are little long but they do not touch the ground when wearing shoes.  They are out together well. The waistband was a little big but they are easy to fold over.
B00W5XEFQU|5|Picked these up for my wife to use around the house to cover her feet with to keep them warm.  I tend to keep the temperature in our house around 73 degrees because I work outside in 90+ degree weather everyday.  She tends to complain at times it's too cold in the house and wears socks quite often inside.  She really likes them, said they fit great and were nice and soft.  They seemed to be well enough made and were nice and soft to the touch.  She normally wears a size 7.5 or 8 in womens shoes and these socks fit just fine on her.  They seemed to be about spot on size wise for her.  She has worn them a few times now I have noticed, so they must be just fine for her to use around the house.  If she's happy with them then they must be just fine.  Haven't had any complaints about them at all, so they must be OK.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price to review.
B008K9XDGQ|4|Nice quality Belt, I think I will order more if more colors are available. The clasp holds well with no slippage. This belt is easily trimmed to size.
B001LK2X8A|4|It's about the best quality for price you are going to get in a halloween mask. I just cut the back and put new velcro and it fits better. It is very realistic for a costume. Excited to wear it.
B0085IFPYK|4|I'm a tall guy (6'4\\" - 230lbs)- and XL sizes NEVER fit.  Typically the sleeves aren't long enough and shoulders usually too tight.  If I go to XXL size the shoulders and sleeves then fit BUT THEN I'm wearing a Tent.  So I was doubtful about the claims that Carhartt runs large.      Reviews say to order a size smaller...hmmm.  Decided to give it a try - and YES - the XL is perfect size - and shoulders fit fine.  But the Tall size was unnecessary - sleeves are too long. Returned this for an XL reg and all is fine.  I've never run across a maker who cuts a Reg XL that fits me. Love it.
B005H3BD0Q|5|I bought these socks as a Christmas gag gift for my 27 year old daughter who is still infactuated with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Well, she loved them and was impressed that all four colours were in the pack.  It was a well worth it gift and the price was very reasonable.
B001KNL2NA|2|The hat looks alright, but it is very small. The material becomes irritating due to the snug nature of the hat. I could not wear it so I gave it to my younger brother (he is 9) and it was very snug, even for his head. I would not recommend this to anyone with a hat size larger than 7, and due to it's itchy material, I find it hard to recommend to anyone.
B002919NIS|1|In the picture it looks great, but when I got it, I was very dissapointed.  After I wore it a couple of times, the T-shirt looks extremely old.    I wouldn't recommend this purchase
B00KFEFIIK|5|Amazing product I will purchase again
B00LVP8JX8|3|Its very good looking jacket, but shoulder is very large. My son is reguler size kid but he looks like BAYMAX FROM BIG HERO 6. He  has normal height, he is 8 yr old but this jacket is running small with big large oversize shoulders. I wanted to return it, but my son wore it in my absense becouse he likes the color and style. Also filling is very hard inside.
B00IZKUFAC|4|if you need any size order a  bigger one!!
B003XU6ROM|5|The belt is thicker than I am used to (it still fits in my belt loops easily), but soft and flexible. It feels like it is high quality and seems to be made of the best materials (has &#34;Full grain cowhide&#34; stamped on the inside of the belt). I've worn it every weekday for around a month now and it shows no sign of wear yet.
B00BMR4GCI|5|I brought this for waist training it is a great buy especially for the price and really pretty love the corset
B004LL9FGY|2|Did not stay put rode up legs
B00E8GROHE|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it!
B007SWSQTK|5|Awesome shirt!
B0006I6UO6|3|Small stocking, but good value.
B0178HGNIA|4|My husband found these so comfy that this is our second order.
B00MMIWWLI|4|this was a goooood gift
B00BVVHPJ6|5|I am usually a 30 and I ordered a 32 due to the fact that these jeans say that their junior fit, slim through hip and thigh. They fit me great, a little on the snug side, which I tend to like. I have a smaller waist and more curvy butt and thighs, so if your the same I would order a larger size then what your used to, like I did.
B008X1JJ2I|5|It was more than expected for the price. Not just one but two shirts to mix and match. thank you/!
B008G51WHQ|1|Cute dress, poor quality.  Maybe it was the first dress that the child in the Chinese factory made.  The collar was completely off center. I have to take the dress apart and sew it together again.  Why not send it back?  It wasn't sent with a reciept or return info.  It also took 6 weeks to be delivered.
B0055QNN5S|5|alleviates pain with in minutes of putting it on.  he wears it everyday for work and the second one to sleep in.  has made life alot better!
B001V5ZG9I|5|The Small Beetle is very well designed bag with beautiful craftmenship.  The size is perfect - compact yet holds a great deal.  The zipper pocket on the inside and the two pockets on the outside come in handy often.  I love the fact that the bag is convervative looking so that I can use it during the work week and also relaxed enough that I use it on the weekends.  The fact that the bag is made out of recycled tires is an even greater bonus!
B002WG1JEQ|5|These are the cutest socks hands down. They appear to shrink and that is my only complaint.  I do hand wash but still they do shrink
B004RZEB86|5|Item arrived very quickly with prime free trial. Item runs a little big, I am 5'4, 120 lbs. and ordered a small and fits perfectly. The headband has a star that is a little off center but other than that, I love it. Can't wait to wear it!
B000SKI752|5|Not much to say-they are socks after all, but they fit well and even after a few months they still seem to have good grip around my calf.<br />I'd buy again.
B00MU2E6YM|5|Shirts are GREAT quality, they just run a little big for my taste.  If I could purchase this all over again I would order myself a medium; but I like a snug fit on my t-shirts, so this is more a personal preference.  I am normally a size large in all clothing.  I'm 5'3&#34; and have an athletic build with a little bit of cushion LOL If you like a little wiggle room then the large would fit fine.  I bought my shirt to wear during a crossfit competition and when I wear workout clothes I like them to be snug to my body.
B0059DWKMO|5|Order A size small and it's perfect fit. I have very broad shoulders and was concerned that I shouldnt order a size down like the other views recommended. But I did and am happy with the way it fits.<br />Pros:<br />Very rain resistant<br />Self packing pocket<br />Adjustable hood<br />Lightly insulated<br />Zipper and buttons<br />Wind resistant<br />Cons:<br /><br />Yet to come across any
B00JE2YM0E|5|Love these Boxer Briefs! The X-Temp boxer briefs do exactly as they advertise they are going to do. They help keep you feeling cooler when your active and moving around all day. Wearing the type of pants I do for work, I found that when I'm active I was feeling overly hot. These help keep you feeling cooler no matter how much your moving around or what your wearing that day. The fit is also spot on, which I appreciate. I have bought other brands of boxer briefs and these are by far the most comfortable as far as fit goes and they also don't ride up on the legs. I appreciate knowing that when I put these on in the morning they are going to be staying in the same spot when I go to take them off that night vs. all over the place throughout the day.
B00G59O5EW|3|I returned  the dress mostly because it was such a thick heavy fabric.  I was going to wear it to a summer wedding and it was itchy and wooly feeling
B009NA6KDE|5|i would have a hard time working without these socks.
B00CHQ4DZS|3|Love this robe. Unfortunately it came with a tear and they no longer carry the item in the size I need or color I want. It is so nice I don't care about the tear..I won't send it back unless I know I can get another.. it is that nice!This robe is oversized,, so plush,, actually goes to my ankles,, it is the most comfortable robe I have ever had. It is a lot thicker than the robes most stores carry now and yet doesn't make you too hot. I would recommend this robe to others..I love it!!
B00FDUJATE|4|Thick terry and nice length.<br />Generous velcro strips
B00JBOMQ5I|5|This dress is adorable and has received many complements.  I am 5'4, 130 lbs and the fit is very flattering.
B000FEC95K|2|I'm 5'6\\" 145 lbs medium build and I bought a pair of small CK Men's Micro Modal Trunks. Their construction is good but honestly, they're a bit too short and therefore not as comfortable. When I'm walking especially, I feel them hiking up my thighs and not staying put whereas the ExOfficio underwear, the legs are longer and tighter and stays put. I would definitely would have bought more if they didn't hike up my legs because they are slightly more comfortable than the ExOfficio but honestly, they're both so comfortable, I'd choose the ExOfficio over these any day.<br /><br />I wear ExOfficios every day now and will only wear this pair of CK trunks when I'm completely out of clean ExOfficio underwear and don't have time to do laundry.
B00F0W9XSI|2|I love the top since I first saw it, great fit and materials but I am disappointed. The top in the description says it is reversible but mine is not! the reversible part is all in a yellow fabric and nothing like the picture. If you sell NOT reversible tops PLEASE put it in the description. I feel a little bit cheated and robbed.
B00CXQFU8Q|5|than larger size usually wear
B0012XX7OA|5|great product, great service
B00V4VL74W|3|Very little support.
B00ED3VHE8|5|I am 6'2&#34;, 200 Ibs mostly fit in the Army so I would consider myself that.. XL was PERFECT for me, though I usually am between a large and an XL when it comes to sizes on average, so if you are my height and weight I would highly recommend XL.
B00877MAZQ|5|Awesome coat and fit. My son has worn  it everyday since Christmas.
B00OZTFDCM|4|I'm a size 8 with a 36 inch bust. I ordered a large based on the reviews and it fits just fine.
B003828R16|5|I love the briefs, but the sizes run really small.  My grandson loves them with the cars characters.  Hope they help him potty train .
B0083G9KI6|5|I've only worn the jacket 2 times. I love the soft a little bit worn leather look,feel and smell. The jacket was a little tight the first time I put it on but after wearing about an hour relaxed a bit and fits perfectly. Perfect mid range jacket, I have a heavier leather jacket so in 40-60 degree range it's great. Arrived on time.
B00E6HA2WO|5|I have always loved Hurley hats.  I will not buy any other type of flex fit hat.  The flex fit style fits true to size.  Very comfortable
B005K02WQA|5|I bought these for my son who is a big boy and tall.  Regular uniforms are uncomfortable to work in and he was always worrying about his stomach showing because they simply aren't long enough.  He has told me several times how happy he is with these scrub tops.
B00847H2Z2|5|great
B00E634EUO|5|great shipping!! very soft and very nice!!! LOVE IT
B004ARZKJA|4|These are handkerchiefs. They are machine-washable, ironable, and practical and non-ostentatious. I recommend using them for blowing your nose, instead of wiping your nose on a napkin, a sleeve, or a wrist.
B004VQWW2S|1|I ordered the &#34;boys' monster bag and twice I got shipped a pink and orange monster bag. It was cute, but I was looking more for the blue/green bag instead.
B0091K9USS|4|These costumes are very fun. Our QUWF (Wildlife conservation) group used them in a parade to illustrate angry wildlife because they had no food or habitat and all along the parade route we heard &#34;Angry birds&#34;  They have pouches for you to stuff bed pillows in them to shape them and the pillows get very heavy so I would recommend feather pillows or lightweight stuffing.
B006LHMVMQ|4|Dave<br /><br />They fit, but none of these have ever really fit perfectly. I definitely should have gotten a few more pairs and probably will this week.
B00X8B33RU|5|Nice and comfortable.
B00KIQTOJY|5|Love it.  Very colorful.  Don't mind the straps showing--they become part of my outfit.
B00MQR07IA|5|I'm super happy.... my husband saw it and thought it was the cutest..... thank you!
B00CYAVPCG|3|The top is not as long as it looks, and the string tie is very bulky and doesn't lie flat.  Should have been done with a flat ribbon.  Still like PattyBoutik, though.  Great service.
B009F96I26|5|I have been looking for a unique, lightweight skirt like this and am so glad I stumbled upon Bombay Fashions on Amazon.  The skirt is see-through, as described, but a slip provides a solution.  The fabric is free-flowing and the design and colors are beautiful.  I agree with other buyers that the elastic waistband is too snug.  I am 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs, and the waistband fits fine and isn't uncomfortable, if I were to place it directly around my waist.  However, I prefer wearing most of my skirts, shorts, and pants at a lower, below-the-waist level.  When I place the skirt's waistband around my hips, where I prefer it to be, it feels too snug, but it's still not horribly uncomfortable.  I think the skirt would be perfect if it came with no elastic waistband and instead just had a drawstring, so I can fit it as tight or loose as I desire.  Aside from that one drawback, I am so happy I made this purchase and will still most likely purchase more of this product in the future.  The price and free shipping is worth it!
B003ZS7H14|4|Super cute and makes practicing belly dancing more fun. :)  It's not a lot of fabric, I think the model is a little tinier than I am.<br /><br />Wendy
B00FSJZVZ2|5|Beautiful shirt fits great, colors vibrant.
B00FB4EL5K|5|I bought this as a gift for my friend and now I'm thinking about buy one for myself, it better than I though!! and arrived earlier than it supposed :'D
B006JQ4BUY|5|Got one for my wife, lovely dress for the money, even has imitation jewels on the waistband. Could easily be used for eveningware  Excellent value for the money.
B002LCYFFG|3|I bought the largest size available but alas, it was too small for my dad. If you have a large head and are concerned about size, I would NOT buy this hat.  Tip: I also bought the Scala Classico Rain Hat - Bucket Hat by Dorfman Pacific on Amazon which was of great quality and plenty big enough.
B00HI0IY2G|5|I get tons and tons of compliments every time I wear them. The fit is great and the pattern is very pretty. I'm an elementary school teacher so I get these compliments from my colleagues and students alike.
B00DBRQSU0|4|i love it, its so pretty and it flows nicely when i dance.
B00SAYMGB4|1|Way to small!!!! My granddaughter is 3 and the dress fit her 19 inch doll!!<br />Wasted my money,
B00GTW3LTK|3|Quality looks good but the sizing looks small.  A fit for ages 3 to 7 seems unlikely and I am buying for a 6 yr. old.
B00K6CW4YC|5|Perfect for everyday wear!
B00928XTRC|1|Wow! Amazon - I'm embarrassed to say I have shopped with you! In today's world when stuff like this is (unfortunately) commonplace this kind of \\"prop\\" is just plain disgusting! It's high time you step up and stop selling crap like this! It's not funny. Shame on you!
B007W6634W|5|This belt is very cute! I bought it for myself because I wanted a wide belt. Unfortunately it was about 2\\" too long for me, so I gifted it to my cousin instead. She loves it and it looks great on her. Great value!
B00J56J8C6|3|Cute. Wish the bottom clip was covered with fabric. Its just metal.
B00BJGFL3A|4|Wife says it fits fine and holds the puppies firmly in place.
B008I6V4IA|5|I'm a cosplayer and someone bought these for me to use for my Panty cosplay. They were packaged extremely well to insure that they wouldn't get damaged during the shipping process. I'm very pleased with them.
B008CFZW4Y|5|I love this store even though I never bought anything from there yet.haha just need money ha jersey shore wow.
B005UVVTUY|5|I would 10/10 recommend these pants to my fellow plus size ladies. They're comfortable, flattering, and just downright awesome. They look good with crop tops, shirts tucked in, jackets, whatever. They are versatile, durable, and cozy. The legs are snug, but not overly so and that was just what I was looking for. My ONLY complaint, and not enough to take it down to 4 stars, is that the pockets don't like to stay in their place. I've accidentally put my foot in the pocket hole instead of the leg hole several times. However, it's only a minor nuisance and doesn't detract whatsoever from my love of these pants. I wear an 18/20 or 2x in most things, and these were true to size. I have a 46 inch waist, from the last time I checked, and the elastic at the waist band was a bit tight at times but not unduly so, and not enough to detract at all.<br /><br />Bottom line-  I would recommend, I would buy again. Buy this.
B00G0MK29Q|5|Feels good on. Looks great. True to fit.
B0009GA7T4|5|He really likes the soft feel and comfort of these shorts and would love to keep buying as needed to .
B001P3052O|3|Not what I would expect from gerber. The 100% cotton material is very thin and feels very cheap. BE CAREFUL....ONESIES RUN SMALL! I ordered 6-9 month size and they seem to fit a 3 month old. I can only imagine how much smaller they would be once they are washed as it is known that cotton shrinks.   They could possibly fit a 10 lb baby that is no longer than 23-24 max inches long!
B001M084S2|5|Husband BIG Queen fan.  He was plesantly surprised when he found this in his stocking.  Now he's looking for a shirt to put it on.
B00453JU04|3|The item looks pretty as it appears on line.  It is however smaller then expected.  I would recommend getting a size bigger.  So if you are a large, you should get the x-large.
B00A3G257C|5|Love this wallet!!<br />I'm going to buy several the next time I purchase it.
B00ISGT48C|5|We loves seeing this shirt on our 19 month old who will be a big brother in a few months. Hopefully it still fits when the new baby comes.
B001T6UGLC|1|I didnt like because it was definitely not adjustibale spaggittibstraps and their was no self built in bra so you people lied to me.
B004L5WRII|5|I use to wear these clips everyday in the 80\\"s! They kept me cool in the summer and were so much more stylish   then just a reguler pony tail. I was so happy to find them on Amazon. They disappeared in the stores! LOVE this product!
B002ARF146|5|Very nice satin purple bow tie and cummerbund. My son needs these often for Fraternity events and this was perfect as the price was right! Fast shipping and no problem getting it delivered to a Frat house which sometimes is problematic for certain carriers.
B00K9EPBMY|4|Too cute.
B00IZ38GIW|3|not made to last but was only bought to play around with anyway good price for what you get .
B002Y1T9KA|4|I gave this as a gift and was told that it looks great at work, is comfortable and gets a lot of compliments.
B00NHBKW0C|5|Great hat for the sun here in Hawaii. For the price it is a must-buy hat.
B00J4YTB4Y|1|I'm not sure if &#34;somewhat small&#34; describes it. I ordered my regular size and it fits ok through the body, but the gathered fabric just will not lay properly over the breasts. The fabric is too flimsy and stretchy, so it does not have enough body to stay in place. It's like thin t-shirt fabric, so it looks a bit sheer when it stretches even a little to accommodate fairly ordinary-sized breasts. It pulls the whole top forward and downward, showing the top of my bra, too much cleavage, and giving me the feeling that the straps are too long. When I tried pinning up the straps a bit to consider altering it, the fabric shifts and bunches up ABOVE my breasts. If you are small-chested, you will probably be ok. If you have average to larger breasts, you may not feel confident in this dress.
B0037OBHFS|5|Needed a western shirts with snaps and this one wad the right price . Fit perfect and looked great .
B002VN9HMG|1|Do not waste your money on this product! The outside may be aluminum but inside it's all plastic. The clasping part is plastic and broke within two minutes of use. For the amount of money and description of product I expected a quality item.  I should have read the reviews before purchasing this item!
B00AND0H3O|4|I am giving four star because inside portion material does not look good. Not that big as you can imagine from the picture.
B0015HSOSC|2|The cups are rather triangular or pear shaped... great if you're built that way. If you're more round it just feels like you're wearing cones...
B004JSN1AK|2|The material is very thick. It looks more like swimwear than under garment. It didn't allow pants/shorts to glide on and made clothing feel too small.
B0091J4854|3|The shirt is not bad. However, I encourage you to go up a size if you are in between sizes or if you are busty.
B000FXW5AK|5|Love them
B004ZHIN58|5|good fit and quality
B00O540YZ8|5|Nice t shirt
B00WDWE46E|5|Super cute, nice fabric and not see thru. This top looks nicer then pictured with a nice fit. I love it and wish there were more colors.
B000V6Y2ZM|5|GREAT outfit for Halloween and for an Oktoberfest party!
B008G51W0S|5|So worth it just for the belt alone! I wanted the belt separate but bought the dress cause hey, 2 in 1! I am a twenty-something who has children. I wear 4-6 size. I would say if you have hips...go a size up. The quality of this is AMAZING for the price. I don't know why so many people complain about the quality when their products when umm they are so low priced. Yeesh if you want something more go buy a dress at a designer store instead of here LOL! The fabric is thick. I can wear my red bra and you can't see it through the fabric. I would 100% recommend it... and the shipping isn't as long as they say btw. Expect it sooner. GO FOR IT!!
B00QT1OIJ8|5|Super comfortable
B003H6DCBS|4|My Spanx works great I will order others this time with straps
B00UJKVAKU|5|Delivered as advertised! Husband loves it!
B004R1NUDW|2|This shirt fits well but it is very thin and see-through. Unless you're wearing it over a sports bra to go to the gym or to bed at night, it is pretty worthless.
B00LM3Z1LC|5|its just a tie!
B002P2T5RA|3|The blue ones that I boug fit perfect, but the black ones not so much. Its like one leg was seen wrong
B006SWH4GC|5|These are heavy duty socks that are great to wear with boots.  They are thick and very comfortable.  they also go over the calf and stay up where you need them to be.  Excellent socks for all day wear and especially for boots!.
B00JXHJE8U|5|I'm happy I don't have to cut off an inch from my husband's jeans and try to hem them on my sewing machine.
B000RN2CCE|1|I really really wanted to love this bra because of all of the great reviews.  Although it is true that it is best to try on bras before you buy them, and get a professional fitting, I wear a 36DD in every brand that I have tried on at a store, and I own dozens of bras from various makers, but this bra is the first one that is too small for me around the band.  So, I bought a bra \\"extender\\" but then had a second problem --I am 5'3\\" and a little short-waisted and the hard sides of the bra poke me under my arms and distract me all day.  It does \\"lift\\" tremendously well, but I don't understand why this brand doesn't size their bands accurately.
B00M8XUR0A|4|Socks are a bit thin, but nice assortment.  In retrospect, I wish I'd ordered a package with all of the same pattern/color, because sorting little girl socks is like being captive in one of the levels of Dante's Inferno.  It's so bloody hard to find a match...  But that's more a reflection of my laundry skills than the product.  Decent product.
B00CONNILE|5|Fits perfect
B000B59XMA|5|Excelent!!
B00QA6T7BG|4|ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR AS PICTURE
B00IV8VGE2|1|The cut of this gown pushes big nursing breasts to the sides - so unflattering! Armholes are cut too high and the empire waist band is tight (my normal size is 4-6 and I ordered a small - definitely order up). The dress hangs nicely on the pictured model, who is clearly not nursing!
B00PKZV2Y8|5|Love this blouse, great buy.
B00K6IXPH6|5|Great shirt, came quickly and is good quality and will be wonderful for the world cup watching! Fits exactly like a large.
B00PXZV4HU|5|super cute dress I love it, It's true size and fits perfect
B00971N3HA|2|I have an A cup so this outfit would probably have looked better if I had a slightly bigger bust. There was just something empty about the top ( shoulder and bust area) for me but I think that is just how this fit looks on my body type i.e. (small bust and bigger rear).<br />The other problem I had w/ this piece was that the waist area was not fitted at all like in the photo. I may have to take it to a seamstress or maybe safety pin it to give it a more fitted look. the string that goes around the neck is elastic so I liked that bcs i can tell the knot i tie at th back of my neck will definitely stay in place. : )<br />As for the lace hem at the bottom of the dress, its very cute and I was happy w/ it.<br />I'm 5'2 114 lbs. (most of it in my rear lol) and the lower part of the outfit looked good from the front and back. The length was perfect for me too.
B00PXSSGX2|5|Great material!
B00EUI44GO|5|These are super cute! I'll definitely consider buying from here again.
B00NBP8LUW|5|I love it and I recommended because I have got so many compliments on it is so beautiful worth the monies I paid
B00I30UAUY|2|Jacket came quick, the color is fabulous, but the fit is too, too tight. I ordered a XL, but it fits like a medium. My arms are long, sleeves come a tad above my wrists. I usually wear a large, but ordered a XL because of my long arms. I'm 5-8' 165 lbs.... XL usually fits me just right. I'll probably give it to a relative or co- worker.
B000145UKA|1|I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire.
B0096GO29E|5|Very nice!
B00K1JUNY8|4|Like the romper fit like i expected.... Im happy with the purchase thanks
B0007YXRTA|5|Comfortable.  I love it.
B0035ROWJ0|5|This order came more quickly than other online orders I have made.  The product was exactly what I ordered and in perfect shape.<br />No disappoinments in any way.  I am a very happy consumer!
B00DIX5X58|4|great!!
B005PG8IJY|5|I was very pleased with my purchase. The realism of the necklace is charming, it's not too heavy, and I love the appearance of the pewter. The service was great as well- it arrived almost a full week before it was scheduled to. I would definitely recommend both the product and the seller.
B00ELR1SUO|5|I had ordered these bras for yoga because all the sports bras i had were from vvictoria secret and were a little too tight for yoga so i figured i would try something new.<br />These bras give me careless frexability with enough support to hold everything in!
B00AHAH0ZG|5|Love all fox products, this is no different. Fits nice, looks great, and get compliments on it. Probably get some folks ordering this one with all the people that liked it!
B00DC8GJXO|5|excellent top
B002S4P7LS|5|The hats are so snug and they fit everyone that tries it on. I'm really happy with these. I was a little upset that they arrived a little late but when i did get them I was really excited. Thanks for the hats!!
B00AAQTWOE|3|Collar is a bit odd. Does not want to stay flat. But generally works.
B004OZ5OBM|5|These are the best work socks ever! They fit great and stay up on my legs great even after a 16 hour shift.
B00A2SOV50|5|Color is slightly different from the pic but even though is terrific. The fit is great, adjust to your body and show your curvy body as the title of the jean. It is very comfortable to wear as for casual or any other type of occasions. It fits well with boots, ballerinas, sandals. So this jean has great choices of matches with clothes as well with shoes. So, if you are a levis user, I recommend to purchase one or two sizes less than your regular one because it stretches a lot, it just depend on how much tight do you want to your body. I am 30 and had to purchase 28 but fit excellent.
B009LJMFY0|5|Excellent panties.  Fit well and are comfortable!
B005PZZ168|5|I love love love my new coat!!!  It has a very feminine flair with a sleak, sophisticated cut.  At first, I was a little weary of buying a coat online, but this was a great purchase.  Also, unlike most women's clothing, the pockets are very deep, and I love that they are &#34;hidden&#34; in the pleats of the jacket skirt.  It's more of a grey than a taupe but it goes with anything!
B0062WL806|5|again all my stuff from Patty is great.  I have at least five pieces
B00IVC1CII|5|It&#34;s cute
B00BZ5HVYC|5|OMG!!  We went to an Off-Broadway play in Times Square and it was a hit!!!  My wife thought I was an idiot for getting it, but it wound up being the hit of the evening!!!  No matter where we went, it got positive comments.  If I would have had 100 of them on hand, I could have sold them all.  It looks authentic and it took several times for some to look at it and not know it wasn't a real tux----except that I wore shorts with it.  There is a white line down the shoulder line, but as it turned out, I had a Sharpie in my back-pack and a little adjustment and we were on the town.  GREAT PURCHASE!!!
B00IJPPK94|5|Best bra over &#34;designer&#34; brands. My daughter loves it. Still very girlie and extremely comfortable along with being true to size measurement chart provided. Great price too. Very satisfied. Highly recommended.
B00DDXD33M|4|Jeans were exactly what l was looking for. I owned another pair of YMI but the zipper broke so I needed a replacement. I wear a size 3 and they fit as expected. Love this brand!
B00AV8DKK8|5|she loves them
B0018OOJUE|5|Was pleased with the pants and the prompt delivery.
B00Q3KXPIU|4|I REALLY THIS SKIRT
B0093O12MO|5|My granddaughter is 7 and the 6 fit perfectly.  Its well made and looks adorable on her.
B006O3W3HK|5|Great basic
B00F9SSSMA|4|It's somewhat large around my chest and tight around my hips (however I am a 36B with wide hips).  I still get compliments so I don't regret this purchase!
B00IF6636Q|4|Bought this for a St. Patrick's Day themed trip with a bunch of friends. It fit me okay but seemed a little tight around the shoulders and chest. I'm only 5'5&#34; but I have pretty muscular frame so that is probably the reason. It wasn't uncomfortably small but it did feel pretty snug. That being said, everyone loved the shirt itself and a few folks even took pictures of me wearing it.
B00368CLRS|5|I always have a hard time finding sports bras with the right support. In a 34 G so it's not easy and the ones that do work are supper expensive. This one works very well at a fraction of the cost.
B00FPXRW6W|2|There were some yellow spots on the tee. But we managed to remove after washing it.
B00192DVT0|4|This is a very nice looking jacket, but I thought it was going to be a little bit heavier.  I ordered a large thinking that it might be too big, turns out it just fits(I'm only 5'11).  In fact the sleeves are just long enough for my arms.  Maybe even a tab too small.  There was also a seam already coming undone where the sleeve attaches to the jacket on the inside.      Overall I like this coat but because of the seam and the way it fits me I think I'll stick to buying coats from stores in the future.
B00F0L9WWG|5|Cool shiny material. Easily pulled against anything rough. Neat bionic pattern. Cool for Halloween costume. Elastic top that isn't very flattering. But what do I expect for cheap leggings.
B005GYUSE8|5|DKNY Panties are the best next to Calvin Klein. I love them so much and love how they hug my curves. They are so comfy, and they are just beautiful looking and feel great. Buy these, you will never want to go without them
B004JLXNKA|5|LOVE THIS DRESS!!!! It truly hides all flaws and is beautiful and casual! Fits perfect.
B004W0FWT8|5|IT WAS PERFECT
B0051CBBQY|5|Feels and fits nicely I ordered tow others in different  colors
B006VWLPLE|3|The shirt is very nice.  If you are a small framed man and like a fitted shirt, this is the shirt for you.  i bought for my son and usually XXL gives him extra roominess but this shirt is fitted and reminds me of an under armor shirt.  It is a very nice shirt.  The logo on the front of the shirt has a pattern over it that seems really cool - like it would be reflective
B004PNUM06|5|Husband loved it. Christmas favorite that he will use when he golfs for sure.
B003YDDG3I|2|Way too small to be of any real use. I would not recomment buying it unless you have something larger along with it to use for protection. I even thought of returning it.<br />You can fit passports  (2) in it, but they will bend around your leg.  You can use it for that.  But as far as credit cards and such, it is a hard fit to get anying else in there along with the passports. The passports are the only use I personally will use it for.<br />It does fit around the leg nicely, and it will not fall down.
B000N8LUXU|5|these work great, and the pair costs less than most of the single ones i found elsewhere
B00EAIXXUW|5|This is a pretty little sheer top but it is not white. I bought it because I needed a white top for my daughter, its off white but we kept it because its soo cute and sparkly and will go with jeans.
B004QP46BE|5|Excelente vestido. Buena tela y costura, adem&aacute;s de ser muy comoda. El producto es como lo describe el vendedor. A la hora de enviar el vestido lo empaqueto en excelente condiciones.
B00A2XOBNM|5|I am addicted to scarves. More than a jacket or a vest, a scarf always gives you an air of noble refinement. These ones are really great. The one in the picture was on sale, so I could buy another one in different colors. This one is very distinguished, only in black and gold, and the shipping price was also discounted, I would like to warmly recommend the seller as well as the quality of their products. I can't wait wearing them! Will give an update on this shortly.
B006L3VCPC|5|I love this product and wish they came in different colors. The sheer dots are still opaque enough to allow for warm and comfort to wear under capris and shorts worn during indoor and outdoor workouts.
B00E8D6VOY|4|I gave these to my daughter as a gift; she's on her phone and tablet all the time so I thought she'd like these. And she does, especially during this cold snap.
B0027IAOB8|5|I had to break down and get a few new pairs of Thorlos, my others ones wore out after 10+ years.
B00DSQSJR4|5|They arrive on time. The pants fits perfect and they are little wider on the legs for people with big thighs like mine.
B00G10OAKY|5|I found these to be comfortable and warm, which is pretty much all I can ask from thermal underwear! The first time I wore them was in -17F weather and the only part of me that was cold was my face. I would definitely buy again.
B00ANSYLG8|5|I love this dress it looks so pretty on and the color is so nice, I cant wait til the spring to wear it.
B00B1ZOEHI|4|Beautiful top...very sheer...need camisole or undershirt to wear. Requires ironing. Color is accurate in photograph.  LOOKS GREAT WITH BLUE JEANS.
B00565VYJA|5|They are perfect!!! I'll wear them a lot! These are classic pair of pants! and the fit as expected, thanks!
B007BYEF9K|5|My son has them on his wall in his man cave.  They compliment his game room very well.  The walls are painted red and gray.
B00A8YZFXU|5|Love it comfy and warm!
B005H5W2KO|4|These are fun leggings and definitely catches people's attention. They run a little shorter than other leggings in the market. But if you are looks for knee height leggings to keep knees covered to avoid scrapes and bruises (and not thigh high), these are PERFECT!
B008SDC54K|4|I liked it. The color and the pattern are very good. If is for my frend and she liked it a lot
B000RDGDPQ|4|These are great stickers - they work beautifully when you have a dress that simply won't work with a bra. These are reusable -but I'm not sure how many times is the limit for reuse although it seems to me after the first few uses they are holding up like new.
B00GJ3CKWS|5|I received my 72 Count Credit Card Holder with Zip Around Closure, and was very happy and surprise when I got it.  I've been looking for one for awhile, but was only able to find some that held a few cards, and when I found this one I had to order it.  It's great just what I've been looking for not big and not small just perfect.  Thank You.
B00TUH9MNA|5|These are NOT meant to be napkins as the other rater stated! They are soft, thin, and work PERFECTLY as a beautiful headband! My hair is short, but I'm in an awkward stage of trying to grow it out. These scarves are easily folded into a thin headband and tied on my head without being bulky. They work perfect and look cute. I love that I can dress them up for work or a nice dinner out, or wear them with jeans and  a sweatshirt. The colors are vibrant and beautiful!
B00Q2ICQ8I|5|perfect!
B003G2Z6RQ|4|I really enjoy this pair of Dockers Signature Slim Fit pants.  As a person with a fairly trim frame, I appreciate that Dockers has decided to make a more form fitting khaki.  The pants fit well through the thigh and leg, but are not so slim that they limit my mobility.  There were a couple loose ends in the stitching, but other than that the construction seems solid.  This is the second pair that I have purchased and, having worn them both for around a month now, I can say that they seem to be durable enough for my office environment.
B00MGG0TFM|4|nice looking jacket - fits well - reasonably priced
B00K3WAP5A|4|My daughter goes to a nature preschool, so they are outside no matter what the weather is. These pants keep her warm and dry-even when she is sitting in puddles. Made of a very durable material and have not gotten any holes or scratches etc even though she has been playing in the woods in them. I would say they run a bit large, my son (who usually wears a size7/8 boys) can fit into these pretty well, but since the waist is adjustable and the bottom cuffs are gathered, my petite 4 year old can also wear them with plenty of growing room.
B00NB4W1ZO|3|Still like it
B00GS6MY18|5|Fits great and was very cute!
B004OU0DD6|2|Fits awful! Honestly don't get it. I'm really disappointed. Ya its nice but the sides are too short so it doesn't cup your head like a cap should! It doesn't fit well at all frontwards but fits not bad backwards and you can't tell the sides are too short when you put it backwards. But still I don't recommend it! And the logo by the way is not as big as the picture on the cap. Its half the size!
B00CVT2WK4|5|Dad likes it
B00FFUWZLM|5|This is the best $60 I have ever spent. I bought one for me and my boyfriend for Halloween this year. The packaged arrived when it said it was going to, which was great. At first I was afraid it wouldn't fit me, but it fits perfectly. I'm 5'1 and weigh 140 lbs, I ordered the adult size for the both of us and it fits great. This is definitely worth the $10-$20 difference from cheaper sellers.
B0091MC9W0|4|how can I get a new one because the one I bought is somewhat small. I can rate at 4 stars
B005LZSW2M|4|The only problem with this product was that I didn't fit to my boobs like a bra. There was no support and it seems like it's only purpose was to hide my nipples. But for as cheap as it is, it's a great product 👌
B00MGRFMSA|5|Love it!!
B00NQMVT2M|1|This item smelled awful when it arrived.  We hand washed it as it was for a photo shoot for a new baby.  The ears, eyes, antlers, bow and nose all fell off.  Turns out they were glued on rather than sewn on.  What the awful smell was we can't imagine.  We threw it out.
B00DUFRNNY|5|These pants fit as expected.  I love the look and feel of these good quality pants. My thin seven year old daughter looks great in these jeans.
B001VNBAF4|5|I bought this because it was exactly what i was looking for. I've used this product for over 2 years now and I still have it
B009LG1I96|5|The cloth's quality is very good. You can't believe you can buy it, just pay 44.99 dollars.  I recommend it strongly.You can't miss it!!
B00BM8JLF4|5|Love these jeans. I have many pair. These particular ones fit more like  jeggings. They have lots of give and stretch to accommodate the less than skinny person. The length is also good for me as I am tall. This is a problem for me with all jeans. The waist comes up more than many AG jeans, but I like that as it holds your stomach in.
B00LVHCD7E|5|I love this hoodie! (Sorry for the dirty mirror)<br />I'm about 5'8'' and around 140 lbs and I ordered a size large and it fit just how i wanted it too. It goes past my butt and covers most of my thighs. It's baggy enough for you to wear a small jacket underneath. It's very warm and cozy. The hood is very big, but if you place it on your head where you want it, it stays and you can even wear a hat underneath it. The sleeves aren't too short or too long and they cover up some of my hands.  This jacket is very cute and it looks flattering for a baggy jacket.
B002LSI32Q|5|Will definitively buy again. They fit perfectly and I didn't have to have them hemmed up for my height. I have that problem finding pants that fit me in all ways. They are also very comfortable.
B00D0GK34E|5|Love this shirt, very comfortable! Fast shipping as well. Thank you.
B0053D106M|4|It is a good size and good quality for the money.  Good purchase for the guys on my Christmas list!
B00GDHPOJ6|1|I wear XL in everyday women's clothing and this shirt for me fit like a sack and the word CHIEFS was on my stomach instead of my chest. So big I can't even wear it & have to return it which is a bummer because I bought it for the game in San Diego. Very disappointed as the picture makes it looks like a fitted or tapered shirt and it's not. It fit like a men's XXXL!
B00U8ZZOLM|5|Very versatile...can be shaped to look sophisticated or casual. Love it. Also great for trips...will pack well.
B006JW32N0|5|Item looks better in person than on screen. Fast delivery.<br />Great shirt. Hoping more designs are coming for Sons of Anarchy long-sleeve T-Shirts
B00715EIXM|5|I'm half tempted to work from home more often because of these! Soft & comfortable! My only complaint is that they feel more like a large size.
B007YQ11M4|5|Very nice shirts. Great fit, as expected. Colors correct as shown. No flaws. Look very sharp. No ironing needed at all. I bought 3 colors, and plan to buy 2 or 3 more.
B008FW2T4U|5|very happy w/ this outfit; great buy (got it 70% off). can't wait for dd to be able to wear it.
B007G3PNBK|5|This hat looks extremely handsome on my husband!
B00RD8L2XQ|5|Gorgeous! just what we expected. Love it! It fits great and my daughter had to wear it the very next day. It's perfect length for her also.
B00FFSA25K|5|This is really a neat set.  Size is perfect and so soft , it feels great. Makes a great lounge set for me.  It looks good enough to wear outside  Love how it feels.
B00KGSCR8Y|1|2 sleeves are not the same
B00JQSZYKS|5|Great feel and great fit. The elastic band is very comfortable and doesn't roll or bunch up.
B003IC0T4E|4|If you are looking for a cool wolf costoue this is the one. the mask's mouth opens when you open your mouth. but the shirt is the best part of the costume if you are looking for a werewolf look.
B00FVXDFA8|3|fast shipping. got a small, was a little to big.
B00XKTDNPW|5|These cargo shorts from Wrangler are made of a soft, mid-weight cotton twill. These are not low rise - they sit right at the waist. They have the regular four pockets and two addition pockets on the leg that feature a flap with a velcro closure. They have a metal zipper with a metal button closure at the waist. There are 5 belt loops.<br /><br />Like most cargo-style pants, the pockets are generous and roomy, which my sons love.<br /><br />There are two, hidden, elastic bands inside the waistband that allow you to adjust the waist for a perfect fit even without a belt.<br /><br />The waist measures 31 1/2\\" with an 11 3/4\\" inseam in this sz 14 Husky. (If you want to compare, the sz 14 Regular measures a little over 29\\" in the waist with an 11\\" inseam.<br /><br />These are soft and comfortable and can be worn as school uniform shorts in my city as they only have one, small, embroidered Wrangler tag on the right cargo pocket flap that can be easily removed. They are well made of sturdy components and will likely last longer than they will fit your child.
B005IBKPMO|5|Was a little larger than expected. Bought same size as jean size, but otherwise great for the price.
B00FDND80S|5|They look as great as in the picture. I normally wear an XL and I ordered 4XL and it just fit. I'm thick around the middle and I looked fat wearing it low like in the picture so I wear it higher and it looks better.  There is a smaller inner zipper and it takes some getting used to. the long outer zipper is worn off the the side. The picture makes it look like it's in the middle.  I like it overall.  It washed well too. I bought 3 different colors.
B00MNLFOD2|4|My boyfriend and I love our sweaters ! We wear them everyday plus their super comfortable . We get compliments asking where we got them .
B007JRAT30|5|It is rewarding to stick with a brand that sticks to its quality, fit and finishes standards.  The big national chain that had my business for 50 years and my children's families for many years really went astray.  They lost our business.  Now buying direct from principled company is rewarding.<br />Colors and size is holding up in washing.  Buttons stay on, Sizing seems accurate, No loose thread.  Clothes like I use to buy.  Since first purchase I have made several more repurchase.
B00241RM5Y|5|Ready for the bitter winter to come!
B00BQEHCAA|5|This viser was better than I expected.  It's definitely sparkly.  The Velcro allows adjustment; similar to the former &#34;no headache&#34; visors. I'd like to buy other colors.
B00GY4V3JI|5|Shrunk drastically after 1st wash wish was a must as it came stinking of vile chemicals! Having to stretch it back to shape is just ruining it and I can't imagine it will last long. Not nice material either.<br />Seller was absolutely wonderful and went well out their way to get me by products so I have to say they where lovely and it's not thier fault that this one product was not up to standard.
B004CMB3GC|5|This is my fourth pair purchased through Amazon. Fit is perfect.  My clothing looks smooth, sleek and sexy when wearing this undergarment.  It is not as bulky as a girdle and perfect for those of us who don't require one.
B000JMUF04|3|For a 'long down coat', this coat is not very long, and not very warm.<br /><br />This coat is described as \\"Our warmest length\\" by Lands' End, who claims \\"You'll always be warm\\" in it. I wish! I got the XS petite, which is the right length in the arms for me, but although I'm only 5'0\\" this coat comes to just below my knee -- it is 3/4-length, not a full-length coat. However, while it is a poofy coat style-wise, and roomy inside, I did not feel like I was floating in it, like some of the other reviewers mentioned. On the other hand, that may have been because I had to wear so many layers under it.<br /><br />The main problem with this coat is that it's just not very warm. It should be. It's supposedly got 650 fill power, but I can wear this coat inside my apartment without getting uncomfortably warm, and while outside? In order to stay warm enough in a Chicago winter I have to either wear my old coat on top of it, or put a down vest, jacket, or two sweaters underneath. Worst of all, I've heard similar complaints from buyers of similar coats from other companies. Apparently, they 'just don't make 'em like they used to' when it comes to long down coats.<br /><br />The only coat that gets consistently good reviews is the North Face Triple C, but it's $300 and hard to find. I'm returning the Lands' End women's petite chalet long down coat, but am having trouble finding anything better. Maybe it would be best to just get the zipper fixed on my old coat.
B005HUYCXO|4|I need the cup size but am very small around the rib cage..never bought a bra online, like it but don't love it. it's a tad big for a 34 but the support is decent.
B007MOYFT4|2|Do not machine dry these pants! They shrink badly. The left leg of my pant shrunk first. The right shrunk the next time. Don't waste your money.
B001H0F296|3|fresh, fit, I can show my tattoo and still is not all over the place, perfect for exercising and sleeping or doing your thing at home.
B00YXDW030|5|Really like the fit and material of these leggings.  The material is just the right weight - not too thin or thick. Comfy wearing during workouts or just lounging.
B008J4X33K|4|It's pretty.  I received a lot of compliments when I wore it.  I will probably buy more in other colors if it is still available
B003HC92LQ|5|I take a size 11 and these fit very good. They are a little tight around the calves, but overall they are a bargain for the price.
B00FREISW6|5|Perfect
B00UYNRZU6|5|All I need now is my lasso of truth!  These fit amazingly well and I love the concept.  My only con is the somewhat iron on feel of the decal but it is outweighed by the offering of underwear that are for plus size that are fun, colorful and not boring.
B007BZ5GW4|4|The shirt fit as expected, true to size. However, it looks rather cheap after a few washes. I would recommend this to somebody for a work out shirt. I had expected a little nicer quality and had planned to wear the shirt to work.
B00AAHUH6U|3|We like clothes that say the trurh about Jesus , never know who it will help,I have other God shirt's
B00XZA9NMS|5|the socks fit, without cutting into the swollen legs - glad I found them!
B00AO9E7KG|1|Order a Diesel jean a well known brand and I received a brand jean Joe. I do not understand what has happened, the bag is marked as Diesel, but the content is different. It does not look or color. Unfortunately for me, this purchase is a great loss because I live outside the U.S.. I have bought many things for Amazon and is the first time I get something wrong. I hope Amazon make the respective corrections.
B00CJJ891W|5|love them
B00BSS10AW|4|It was a good product, as expected.  I can trust the quality of Miss Me.  Juniors sizing moves me up to medium fit tops.
B0059GT1JQ|5|This item was inexpensive and really nice. It was bought as a gift for a tween and she loved it!
B000JHEOYM|5|Love these overalls.  Rugged and comfortable.  I typically wear a 34X30 in jeans.  I read the reviews to get a size larger and they are correct. I initially ordered a 36X30 and they were too small in the waist.  I returned them and got 38X30 and they fit perfectly
B007ZNJZEC|5|Cloth is thick and durable, but not stiff at all and comfortable. Now I am tempted in getting the other color patterns.
B008LTYSJQ|3|We ordered this as a gift for my daughter's friend for her 11th birthday.  She is super petite and a total skinny minny, so we ordered the Girls Medium 10, which according to the sizing chart should have been roomy.  Received it, and it is WAY too small.  Like can't even fit over her head tight.  Okay fabric quality, medium weight -- not too thick, not too thin.  Hopefully, I can get a timely exchange to a Large without a hassle.
B000UJZDDU|5|still fit well a year later! have them in multiple colors.
B00HFJQ13E|4|👍
B00M0ZA23S|5|Nice polo shirt.  Very soft, good length for tucking in. Washes well too.  Great shirt for under $15
B0007YXTT8|5|So many bras make you look braless because they do not lift. This bra lifts and gives you a dressed look.
B00BK81MUI|5|Same as the other one we bought.  It fits my 6 year old daughter great.  It's not scratchy and I've washed it once and it still has it's shine and sparkle.  She is very happy with them and so am I.
B000BMGBL4|5|This hat fits the hard to fit large heads.  It really is extra big and so it is comfortable.  It came on time and in good shape.
B00EP7MF6Q|1|It was more larger then I aspected. But I will order another one soon..
B00F52CQAK|1|I'm not pleased at all with this item. The material felt itchy. They fit weird. It's tight in the knee area and loose everywhere else
B00JE87BBK|5|Beautiful!!! Better than expected
B00JDARCD6|4|This is perfect for Valentine's Day date.
B00J4N5LA8|2|Great fabric , the only underwear my son is not allergic to. Unfortunately the buttons have all broken off (just a forewarning). From the get go I washed these separately on delicate, and tumble dry low.
B005QR8OP0|5|I've always wanted a shirt that gave me superpowers...and this is it!  I was so excited when it came, I could barely wait to rip open the package and try it on.  PERFECT fit.  Best $20 I've ever spent on clothes!  I'm 5'5, 115 pounds - very slender and petite sized - and I purchased a size small.  I wanted a snug fit, and a size small was perfect for me.  Beautiful material, and love the &#34;WW&#34; and stripes and stars on the sleeves.  Beautiful blouse for anyone aspiring to be a Wonder Woman.  You will not be disappointed!!
B0016HNSOQ|5|Execelent!
B00MUUM7C2|1|Terrible seam job where the button snap seam comes apart,I replaced this item a couple times did the same thing every time,gave up the last time.cute outfit worst seam job
B004ADZHR4|1|These pants fell apart after only 3 months. EXTREEEEEMELY cheaply made. I bought them on sale for about $30 and still feel ripped off. Trust me, don't buy Bullhead. You'll look like a dork and then they'll fall apart. Get some Levi's or something.
B0081TG5II|5|I ordered this for my fianc&eacute; and she loved it.  looks great, true to size, sexy as all hell.  Thanks :)
B00GJMM50G|1|The 34 inseam was closer to a 30
B0006TSZBQ|5|This is a favorite!  Very comfortable, perfect for an active day and good for wearing with t-shirts.  The stretch straps add to the comfort, but do make it less useful to wear running.  You can imagine the video review that would go with that one!  Highly recommend.
B00C0JO7IA|2|The outside material has a metallic sheen to it, not the flat color seen in the images. I returned mine. Fit very well though
B00IABXXAU|5|I bought this for my brother. He's at if not a little above six feet tall, so I ordered him a 3X. He loved it. :)
B00405ZTPW|2|The material and color of the product is great. Way better than the previous Levi's jeans that i bought here. But the size of the jeans is somehow a bit small and tight....
B00KB7JCFQ|5|These are super cute, just like I hoped.  They fit her kind of largely, but not too largely, right now, since she's just turning 6 months old.  We cloth diaper, so we need a little roominess for the fluff in the butt area.  :)  Love the prints and the fabric.  Overall, very pleased.
B002U5FX1O|5|Bought this for my niece for Christmas.  Very nice quality.  Looks great after washing.  She won't take it off.
B00F2BGFE2|5|nice
B0055QJIKW|4|It looks nice. I thought it would be a little darker and vibrant color wise but it's still pretty cool.
B008PI686Y|5|This is a very comfortable shirt. Small is still a little large for my 10yrs old son. More room for growth. He could still wear it on the next halloween season...
B00E6356ZG|5|this shirt surprised me , I love it ! I'm a chick , and I love it ! its just a tiny bit big so to allow for shrinkage !
B004UULS8E|5|Super Cute Halloween costume and can also be used at the Renaissance Fair and October Fest!! Highly recommend!!!
B00H8A0EL0|5|great buy, loved it!
B004L5U8NE|5|It's beautiful and a great value for the money spent
B00ACIG2YI|5|big  like  I needed them
B009043F2M|4|Does lift and seperate.
B004496DS6|2|Returning because of the material and size being too large.
B003VWCSM2|5|We have had these socks for 4 months now.  They are are true to size, durable and are thicker than what we expected which is a definite plus! We will be ordering more!
B005JD3U82|2|after few washes they are no use, different socks measure different sizes - total waste of money.. look somewhere else
B006WEHTJ8|3|i love the socks. they're fun and they look good on the baby's feet. unfortunately, i have to say that i think these are too tight. my son is only 3 months old, and these socks are already very snug around his calves. also, one pair had a hole in the heel when i took it out of the package.<br /><br />we will probably continue to use them for a little while longer, as perhaps the elastic will loosen up after a couple washings and they will fit a bit better. it's also possible that i just don't understand the sizing on this product. i assumed that the &#34;0-12&#34; size category meant 0-12 months, but it could also be 0-12 pounds i suppose.<br /><br />because of the blown out heel on the one pair, i'm deducting one star. as for the sizing, i know from past purchases that you're supposed to go up 1-2 sizes when buying some kinds of clothes online from asian countries, so i should have bought the 12-24 size. i'm deducting a second star though, because the fit could have been more adequately labeled or described. as it is, i bought this product and probably won't get much use out of it because of the ambiguous sizing. with the correct size and no quality issues, however, these socks would be a great product (and a great value). perhaps the larger size won't have these issues.
B006YEUC86|5|Love the bow ties...great selection...my husband really loved them. Would order again through same people.  No complaints about shipping. Thank you
B00K8AGXCG|4|Cute little dress for my wife who is now breastfeeding. She likes the fact that the zipper is a functioning zipper, not just for looks. Fabric is okay, SLIGHTLY sheer (ie: don't wear dark unmentionables) but for the price, this was a good buy!
B00U4D5GHK|1|got a color that's not even a option looks like I would have liked it if it had been the right color. will see was happens with the return.
B009VCZ8QO|2|These run on the large size, I needed a belt to keep them from falling down and normally do not for my size.  The quality isn't the greatest either, one of the cargo pockets developed a hole in teh bottom after 1 wash, almost lost my cell phone!
B00CPZAV84|4|bright and bold colors!  they are fun and my son loves them.  They did fit slightly larger than I expected but not too big so he can't wear them.  They have a hidden tie on the inside so you can tighten them if need, worked out great for us!
B00PJ4MJNI|5|Product arrived on time and it looks nice.
B00LNF2KT0|1|It fits me, but is 10 sizes too big for the 5 year old who I had bought it for. What the heck.
B001HMJYK2|5|The price here is much better for this hat than the same one at the western store in my town, and the quality is exceptionally good for the price paid for it.  Not much else can be said about it as a hat.  It's comfortable and keeps the sun out of my eyes as well as looking really nice.
B003GAL992|5|I liked the brand and also the pant I received. Their are done for me. I got five of them and recommend the item.
B003R9KACE|5|Elegantly sexy. Fits awesome and makes me feel hot af. :)
B007FUKK9Y|4|Good quality but runs large
B00C9M704G|2|Hello good afternoon I do not feel very satisfied with the product, because in the picture looks better and to have it in my hands I realized that the fabric is quite thin and the use is very transparent.
B003QOTPM6|5|Although I normally avoid cotton blends (I prefer 100% cotton or cotton/lycra) this shirt is very comfortable and soft and the material used isn't flimsy. The fit is generous, often shirts don't fit across my shoulders. The sleeve length is a little long on me but I'd rather have them a little long than a little short. I bought 3 of these shirts in different colors and I would purchase more. I would definitely recommend these shirts to others.
B00KTY0JVW|2|It's was received the wrong size from the warehouse
B00JULZ26M|1|Tried on right out of the package, fit fine.  After the first wash in cold water and tumble dry on low heat, the length shrunk at least 3 inches.  Basically unwearable.  Disappointed that one can't even have confidence buying something as basic and simple as a t-shirt, especially by Hanes.  These were the 90/10 light steel t-shirts, made in Haiti.
B007GBCRCK|5|great quality, washes well and great price.  I would def recommend these PJs for active kiddos.  very soft, fits to size
B00422M6FE|5|excellent product with its case elegant, spacious for filing the cards I received it in the time it was provided, nice everything, excellent
B00CRTWUV4|5|In wish I could have this in every bathroom. I LOVE IT. Good quality. Didn't use the rings it came with though.
B00383YAN4|4|I'm the owner of several mountain shirts and have been quite pleased with the overall quality and design. However, I've noticed that, occasionally, the website pictures are generally quite vivid and brighter than the physical shirts themselves. For instance, the picture for this dragon shirt makes it appear to be dark red with splotches of bright red on the periphery. But on the shirt there are no splotches and the color is more of a blackish-red.    I still like the quality and the dragon art on the shirt. Just be wary while purchasing these shirts that there will be a slight discrepancy between the pictures and actual shirts.
B004FKKK2Y|5|Beautiful veil, the color is the perfect light, pastel lavender color. It floats nicely and has a nice sheen to it. I have some pastel colored costumes & it matches perfectly. Really pretty. Only thing I didn't like was it had a funny smell to it, stale?
B006HYLAWK|5|Awesome quality cufflinks. Great Quality at a great price point.
B00K8MCKEO|4|Beautiful color and material. It's very sheer so make sure to have a tank to go on underneath it.
B005SJAY4A|5|Fit great looks cute boyfriend loves it came on time did smell a little but after i washed it the smell went away
B007IJ78PQ|5|I love this for nursing.i just ordered another three.too bad they don't have black color size S....
B00KQPI3J4|5|Great sweatshirt. Gets a lot of attention
B00GPH1LX2|5|I love it... great quality & since my baby has a lot of hair so far its the only hat that can fit her head perfectly... the scarf is just a bonus!
B008026CQG|4|I've worn these out and about twice and the view is great. I mainly use my Oakleys for motorcycle riding and these lenses really brighten everything up. I only gave it 4 stars because it's only been a week that I've been using them.
B00X8WQ4V6|1|W.e is on the pic isn't what I recived. It happen to me 8 times already
B00AK8SUQI|3|I noticed that the inseam seemed small.  Someone also reviewed them and referred to &#34;chip and dale were not happy.&#34;  This is what I'm experiencing also.  They're not unwearable but not the most comfortable.  I have 2 pair and will continue to wear them because I love how they look.  If you're looking for super comfortable then you might want to look somewhere else.  Waist size does run a size small as others have reviewed
B00F0Z5K4G|5|Very comfortable
B00MVK7VYK|5|Works perfectly and looks great!
B00NHYOAHK|5|Nice
B00CKPCLWS|5|Great quality for the money! Extremely satisfied and just purchased a second set for my cousin who we just found out was having a girl to get her headband collection started as well. :) Love these and highly recommend! The seller shipped them exceptionally fast also--something I really appreciate, especially around the holidays.
B00O3D165S|3|They are soft and fuzzy but the material is thin on the sole to keep my feet warm during winter on tile floors.  I will need to wear this over a thicker socks.
B00P0DQ402|5|Finally got a size that fits perfectly<br />They run small so had to exchange the large one i originally got for a 2x<br />Im 163lb nd 5'2
B00CQ26MHU|3|It says &#34;97% Cotton/3% Acrylic&#34;, but actually it is made of 45% acrylic, 30% polyester, and 25% wool, so it is not soft as expected, bad feel！
B00AO4I0CC|5|bought this shirt as a gift for my husband. came on time, true to color & fit. nice quality & he really likes it- wore it out the same night he opened it.
B00SFM0PFA|1|I didn't realize when I bought it how sheer the fabric was.  Couldn't wear it unless you had something on underneath.  Totally unusable for my needs.
B00KYXSVWC|5|Just exactly what I expected!  I love it!
B005S6CE9Q|5|I am so happy I made this purchase. The minute I put her in it I knew it was the one. She looks so good in it, and it looks amazing for a baptism. Can't wait to baptize her!
B00PYCISJE|1|Sadly the item is nice but is way too large for me ..... the measurements are very misleading. I ordered a 5XL based on the measurements and from the fit i should have ordered a 3XL.
B00D9B0HUA|1|I ordered a large to make sure it would fit loosely and it was sooo tight!!!!  I normally wear a medium or large depending on how loose I would like it to fit.<br /><br />Sizes run way too small.
B00MA673Z2|1|Had hoped Mens size would solve the problem of sensitive feet.  Just not big enough.
B007HOT7J2|4|Way way bigger than I thought I was going to be but I like the way it ended up looking.
B002YBJYV4|4|...and a small one.<br /><br />It wrinkles and catches dog hair.<br /><br />However, I didn't have to sew the ends together or hem it myself, so there's that.
B00857G5L8|5|This is a great shirt. It fits well and it has a great design. I get lots of compliments on the shirt and I love representing my favorite rock band. It is definitely a shirt worth buying if you are a Killers fan!
B00KQ4IHTQ|3|Not as much denim in the jeans as I would have liked.  They stretch out pretty quickly. I think I could have gotten a smaller size.  But I still like them.
B007P04O50|5|Can't be beat if your in shape and want a shirt that is fitted and doesn't 'bloat' out at the bottom.  Sorry, but I don't have a huge gut that I need extra fabric for.  So this was perfect.  The styling is nice too.  Good cut, good fit.  I do think the color range could have been a bit more varied or slightly lighter in tones, but whatevs
B003I7VUGA|5|You guys have a great selection of designs for \\"OLD GUYS RULE\\" T-shirts.<br />However, would it be possible to OFFER ALL DESIGNS UP TO 3 XXXL (3XL)<br />IN SIZE !

B0032XXNEC|5|This is a very nice bra. the only thing is I am between cups and it is a little big on me cup wise, but I am very happy. Good service also. First time I have liked playtex.
B004GZDS2M|5|Great hat fits great very soft and good quality
B004QF0TEC|5|Would expect nothing less than perfect from dickies and thats what I hot
B000S6ADPI|5|Awesome, glad I was able to find it.
B001FOR44U|5|My husband likes this belt. Since it is braided, he can lose or gain weight without having to poke new holes in the leather.
B002JCDNTC|1|This bra, while pretty, fits in an odd, uncomfortable way.  It is also cheaply made, the wire popped through the first day and, as I stated it fits poorly.
B0031U0PVA|2|The belt is very, very stiff and feels uncomfortable to wear.  It digs into your sides and abdomen when you sit down.
B0027EPNJA|1|I am Maid of Honor and ordered shirts for the bride and 5 bridesmaids including myself. I was sure to buy them all from the same seller so they would all run the same style. 1) They were all black tank tops but different style/brand shirts.  2) The length on the Bride shirt was perfect and the Maid of Honor shirt and 4 Bridesmaids shirts were so short and so small. I would not want a bigger size I would want a longer-style tank top. Short tank tops aren't in style anymore.
B004DCADPI|5|my husband loves these jeans and wears them all the time. I have to sneak them out of his closet to wash them. they are loose and &#34;big&#34; for that extra comfort on planes and while building stuff outside.
B00CU69DJ6|5|i love this so much. great fit, material feels awesome and freeing. doesn't feel too constricting, and keeps everything in one place. love it..
B00KC6ZELM|5|This shirt is so comfortable. It is supposed to be loose, but for a medium it's more loose than I expected. Not a fitted tank!
B003OQTPY4|5|Bought this as a gift and he really likes all of the compartments - very pleased and would purchase again.
B00BZ5SXQ2|4|Put together well enough to make it through a Halloween party or two. The crown was disappointing (it's just a piece of covered thin foam). I wear a size 18-20 and person larger than that could wear the 2x. The back zips up and there is Velcro on the cuffs.
B000NJIEZQ|1|Is this shirt officially licensed by the Anna Nicole estate?  Or by Larry Birkhead, the actual father of Anna Nicole's baby?<br /><br />If not... that is L-A-M-E!  Would you do this to Bieber?
B00NXTFAF0|5|I great fit and comfortable.
B000NZW3IY|3|So I just had to get my XXXXL Teee shirt.  Now why the sam hell wasn't this on QVC? I talk to the QVC operator Samantha every day, she must miss me today.   I had to get my great great grandson Billeh Joe to go on the interaaaaanets to get me this shirt. Such a handsome gifted lil fella, lookin' just like his papy every day at the age of 23. He's best get married fast ya'll! Hes a pappy himself of 18 already.      My great niece nellie looked so beautiful in her three wolf tshirt when we had us a girls night out at the Home Town Buffet. We were all wearing our curlers lookin' our best in our house slippers.  The men were all giving her winks at our visit to Sam's Club, Walmart and our late night bar hoppin' at applebees.      And its best time to get me a new cowboy.. Yeee hawww
B00UOGCK1C|5|Perfect
B00J8PY694|5|So cute! I just recieved it and I love this it reminds me of a vintage pin up girl bathing suit! Very flattering. I am big busted and the top actually fits!
B004M71RQ8|4|This was just want he wanted.Great size and PLENTY of credit card slots and organizational space. Wallets in stores are too small and not enough storage . The vertical wallet is much more accessible than a horizontal wallet easier to carry actually more compact because of vertical style.
B0048BHICU|5|I bought this dress to wear in Cozumel and I ended up wearing it 3 times. It was sooo comfy. I loved it! I did have to wear a white tank to give myself a bit more cleavage coverage but I didn't care. I am a bustier girl so I always have that issue. I wish there were more colors and designs because I would def buy more for summer.
B00CL87HBO|5|Exactly as expected.  Been looking for a wallet like this for a long time.  Finally found it and couldn't be happier.  The leather is soft and exquisite and looks as nice as it feels.  Recommended.
B00JYUEYFY|4|Love this product .
B00ITUHTY8|1|I purchased this jacket for my daughter who is a small framed person.  This jacket was very small for a medium.
B00J3MD78S|3|Cute jacket but had to give it away to my niece. It was way too small even for a petite person.
B00OVEU0TW|1|Too small<br />Too short
B004A7XY02|5|I purchased these since I was having trouble finding them at local big box stores.  They are well cut and the cotton is soft and did not shrink too much.  I will buy again.
B0040LL3OC|5|I bought this cape for my 8 year old son. He has worn this easily over 50 times. This cape has given him hours of imaginative play. Seriously, he has slept in it and even has swam in it.(Not very successful, be he gave it his best)You truly cannot beat the price.
B00F0EGRH6|3|Looks good but sheds like crazy spoiling anything you wear underneath.
B00THPVCZ6|5|FINE
B00PHX4N3A|3|Okay
B001EM7FYC|4|Costume was adult size large, for ladies size 12-14.<br />Bought this for my teen daughter who wears a junior size 7/9, and the costume was really tight on her and had it altered.<br /><br />Was VERY impressed with the customer service of the company I bought it from. Costume Kingdom staffers were real humans (as opposed to the 'robots' who use canned responses to e-mails) who read my concerns and really were helpful. I'd reviewed this item previously, but before I dealt with the company.<br /><br />The company deserves 10 stars for customer service. The costume itself, a bit less. It sure is adorable, but the size issues and the need for another means to keep the wings on took a star off.<br />But I would buy from them again without hesitation.
B0018R1WL0|5|I am 5'4\\", 145lb, 28\\" waist, not apple or pear shaped (fat distributed kind of evenly).  The petite 6 regular (29\\" inseam) fits me like a glove, just a tiny bit loose around the waist band.  I haven't washed the jean yet therefore I don't know if it'd shrink (according to a few Zappos reviewers, it won't).  The pressed black is a very dense black.  Again, a few zappos reviewers said that the color did not fade after washing.<br /><br />29\\" inseam is a good length for wearing flats or heels less than an inch.  I wish it'd come in 30\\" inseam so that I can wear shoes with a bit of heel.<br /><br />Overall, I am pretty happy with this jean.  It looks good enough to wear to work.<br /><br />Update 5-31-2011<br />I lost 30lb since December 2010 therefore these jeans no longer fit me.  The petite size 0 is perfect for me now (5'4\\" 115lb 25\\" waist).
B00EJKOK0S|5|I bought this jacket for my boyfriend in XL and it fit him perfectly. You can see perfectly out of the mesh in the hoodie part. I'm just a little worried about washing this in the washing maching, might have to had wash or dey clean. But he loved it and it was worth the price.
B005P11VYS|5|Love it! Looks awesome, I make the dress look good ;)
B0031U0POM|5|I purchased the brown belt.  It looks and feels like a very good quality belt.  Smells like leather too.
B003TM4SH2|5|These were exactly what I ordered.  I bought them for a friend of mine after I saw how his wallet was falling apart.  He was very happy.
B00KWIJLSC|5|It looks beautiful on my daughter and the bride said it looked perfect! Though the bow is just a pin it didn't look tacky but i was hoping that it was going to be sewn on the dress overall it's a very beautiful dress and I recommend it to all my friends and family and any Amazon shoppers and it came really fast
B005W2G6XG|5|One of the most beautifull dress I bought - Simple, elegant, sexy... and the silk is woaw ! I highly recommand !!!!
B005L183Z2|5|My 1 year old wears this outfit a couple times a week; it's colors are bright and beautiful, it fits great and she looks like a little fashionista - compliments wherever we go!  (Plus, it might be my imagination, but I swear she smiles and giggles more when she's wearing this than any other outfit.)
B00K8LZOGQ|2|I ordered a size 12 months and it is so small that it is tight on my 6 months old son.
B00B2NMVMO|5|Nice graphic. Comfortable. Shirt did not shrink when I washed it. Perfect gift idea for someone who is a fan of the Kalashnikov rifle.
B00BPI91Q0|5|I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. He's a Stark fan so he he was happy when he opened his gift. I saw him wearing it a few times already and it fit him just right. Thanks!
B003RYKPVA|5|I thought this window silloute was great! Very durable, thick plastic. Will be able to use it year after year. I used double sided tabs to adhere it to windows.
B00LFNURTK|4|My son is 8 years old and we bought him this belt to wear with his uniform. He absolutely loves it and wears it every day. It is a great belt, that runs true to size (he wears size 8 pants). The only downfall is that he has been wearing it every school day since August and unfortunately the back is separating from the front. Even though it has only really last 3 months, I plan to purchase another one when this one finally has it's last wear.
B0049KTF4O|5|These socks are nice and soft and soft and soft - did I mention soft?  And fuzzy!!  They are very comfortable!!
B00E3BDJQE|4|I got this for my daughter, and was not sure how good the quality would be since I got it for such a nice low price.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised as it seems to be a nice sturdy fabric, is very soft, and fits her perfectly.<br /><br />It zips all the way up, and the footies fit perfectly. I don't know how the little kitty faces will do in the washer, but other than that it seems like a fantastic bargain for any Hello Kitty fan, or anyone who just wants a cute and warm cozy footie pajama for winter.
B00CHSKHOC|5|Made from quality materials, cleanly printed front graphic, solid machine stitching, fits snugly with strong adjustable back snaps. Very happy with this cool little camo trucker hat.
B00HHKSVB6|5|It is so trendy and people love it. Nice and loose but also very flattering!
B00M28TGYO|3|the medium is like a small. very cute though.
B00MAVTREW|4|a little small
B00G4Z9CBS|4|I have tried this dress and it looks and fits fine. Haven't worn it out yet but looking forward to that.
B005PWXK5A|2|item came in a completely different color than advertised...did not meet the needs once it was received and has not been used
B00L4MGEPS|5|This is my go to belt. Love that it is smooth with no bulk. Love it
B0084DU762|5|I bought two other backpacks from My little Pony China and they both sucked and the zipper tore out within weeks or right after the warranty expired. This one is super cool and well made. My daughter loves it!
B003EH159G|5|Gave as a gift and Mom loves it.  She says it fits true to size and is really cute.  She is looking to buy additional ones.
B000A33QUS|5|Love it.. Very sexy, & comfortable!
B00BNRPI24|4|Surprised how generous this size 12 is and  the length requires heels (am 5'6&#34;) but  am still delighted with this dress. Is  fabulous and flowing, has pockets (how i love a dress with pockets) and is beautifully lined in contrasting fabric.
B0094VN44A|5|love it fits great
B00NF1COVO|1|Was disappointed to see that the back is not only printed with the design, but it's sold WHITE.  If you are looking for a Klingon top, make sure you order one with the print on BOTH sides. The title says &#34;All Over Print&#34; and I didn't notice that it was one side only. I found that misleading.
B00EYBI75G|4|i like these very much..perhaps a tad heavier? for the cold weather? but when summer comes, ill be glad there lite weight
B00OFOKPW0|2|It is the color I was looking for but not what I expected. It has a different fit. Not really crazy about it but I will keep it.
B00JY7FUAK|4|Love the color, fit and style. My lady loves it on me.
B00IJOWJGM|1|I was going to purchase a shirt- BUT... upon closer look, 'Crohn's' is not spelled correctly on the shirt!!!
B004R1LLGA|5|This top is light and super soft.  I wear it to Pilates, you might like it for yoga.  But it is good with jeans too.
B00D5ELXMM|5|Love these shirts hope they get some more available.
B00LX5XOX6|3|It is more like a t shirt.  And the sleeves will choke your arms if you work out.
B00JA4BYIO|2|Arrived on time but does not fit as described. Sizing not as expected. Runs small so I would suggest ordering the next size up from what you need.
B009L8779E|5|Awesome fit,love them. I have a lot of Body Glove gear,well made and endures what I put them thru. wtg
B00LN5HD3I|1|It fit okay but the top had flowers literally glued one and they fell off the first time she wore it. Very cheaply made and very disappointed.
B00LBP1AHA|3|if you are under 5'7&#34; you are set, otherwise, these look silly, even with yoga. should be better listed on ad. gave to my girlfriend (she steals all my pajama pants anyway) and she LOVES them (as with all my other pairs (3) of CandyHusky pants). good quality, GREAT pattern compared to other flat colored pants, very cool look on her.
B00AEJPB7O|1|Bought this in XXL since I like my t-shirts baggy. This fit like a size medium. I am completely done with this brand of t-shirt. This is the 2nd time I purchase something from them in XXL and it fit like a medium. Amazon allowed me to return it - no questions asked.<br /><br />Do not order this shirt if you like baggy shirts. If you wear a Large get the XXL or you'll cringe when you see how small this is.
B00COMTS78|5|cute
B00ANG4NH2|5|AAAA just what the feet asked for. Being a die hard 49ers fan these are the best slippers ever. Go 9ers!!!
B009J7AGPO|5|Because I Love them they are so comfortable. I Love them and I would recommended this to everyone  should buy this!!!
B000VCIORI|4|Great shirt. The background small face detail is not quite as detailed an clear as the Alex Grey art, but the large head looks awesome. Though I get the comment, &#34;why does your shirt say fool?&#34;
B00Q2M4U6A|3|I didn't get this dress, but my friend did and I would have to say for it's price, it's not that bad. But I did notice it wasn't as... 'poofy' it was straighter, not like a ballgown. I wouldn't recommend it if you're expecting the picture.
B00YGZUDRA|4|its okay but  wont last long though
B00J2L4F18|1|Very tight on the arms. Does not fit at like picture. I ordered a M as per reviews and normally wear an XS.
B00E8DD5CK|2|what would be the hem does just looks as though it has been sharply cut.  In addition it is totally see through and the material is very thin (obviously if it is see through).  I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to wear this skirt without showing all of my womanly glory! SMH  even with black under garments will be seen.<br /><br />(sigh)
B00DYRHRUM|1|This dress is cheaply made. The fabric is disgustingly cheap. It looks nice in the pictures but you will regret buying it. I wanted to return it but I had pay for shipping it back to China which might cost close to what I paid for the dress so I decided to throw it away. There's no need to drag my daughter in the cold to go to the post office. Save your money save yourself from aggrevation
B009G3LFBA|5|IF you need something like this it fits the bill.  I bought this as a gag gift and it did all I wanted it to. Fit good, looked good.  I can't imagine why you would actually want this...but for what I wanted it for...did the perfect job!
B007H2L526|4|Excellent craft-personship. 100% cotton feels great and so comfortable.<br />Sizes runs very large i.e. Small is very LARGE even after washing. I can fit two of me in the bottom half.
B008N6Y3NI|4|It is an excellent product but the size runs a little big. I wear small but this is a bit too baggy. I'm giving it to someone though so it still worked out fine. :)
B001PU9A9Q|5|LOVE THESE. They have made my obsession with open-backed dresses and shirts a fashionable reality. I've had them for months and they still stick great. They don't irritate me and I can even sweat a little in the day and they stay on. The matte surface is great and they're basically invisible. GET THEM.
B004B8HV3Q|1|Came in all bunched up and had a blackish stain on it
B00F3EEBP8|5|So the jeans are perfect, perfect fit. They're Levis only the best. But you put Amazon in the mix it only gets better. The shipping was super fast. I'm a very satisfied customer. Will definitely buy again.
B002HRDQ4G|5|Very nice and authentic product.
B0093777JI|5|however, it is well constructed and makes me look 2 sizes smaller; legs and buttocks. It is great for yoga but looks good for running errands. it is $ but worth it.
B003YOZVJ4|3|So the reviews I read were mostly positive. Not sure how that happens because these are at best ok. Yeah they fit ok, I've had some fit worse but as many fit better. The pouch is minimal which isn't comfortable for me. My biggest gripe is the double layer pouch isn't sewen all the way around and crazy as it may sound I don't like hooking my thumb in there when I have to go. It's kinda like those pants you get sometimes that have the pocket in a pocket. Those bug me too.
B0080RE0KG|5|nice fun gift for my bingo loving wife's birthday
B00JEXL5OY|3|The top rim was very tight on my calf and left a deep indent.
B00EZX8XIO|5|Seems to be good quality... fits great but time will tell on durability
B003TJ9EXS|4|Always been a dickie fan
B00D5UZZWA|5|i love it
B007VB95AW|5|This shirt is true to size.  My daughter wear an 8 or 10 and this fit well, with a little room to grow.  The material is nice and the look is sweet.
B0047EO2J0|5|I have purchased at least 5 of their tie dye shirts and LOVE them. Great quality, colors do not bleed. Size is dead on. I could not be happier with these shirts!
B00LSCL698|2|These are not dress pants that you would wear to any fancy event, they are the type of khaki pants you wear to work at McDonalds
B003KG9ZFC|5|i really love this product and my baby fits it wonderfully and its great that they had these clothes because wal-mart were i live doesn't have clothes that she can't fit
B00K6EJ2EK|5|its a fantastic cap with an old style cut and look. bought it for my recently retired father who sails frequently. he loved it.
B00861OYD4|4|I also had same issue as previous review. was sent wrong size twice. Size large is not a 6. its is a seven. Hoping third time is a charm. ha! But its been an inconvenience having to keep returning. The snowsuit is really nice and of good quality and you cant beat the price. They just need to fix the size charts.
B0070UI4JC|5|This is my 3rd HSM coat and I've been very pleased with the product line.<br />Even though much of HSM product appears to be manufactured off-shore, HSM have managed to maintain a consistency in quality.<br />My only advice to anyone considering this coat is HSM tend to run a little large (2 of the 3 HSM coats I own are a little on the big side).<br />FYI: I'm 5'10\\" and about 165 lbs and this Medium runs a little big. Great if you're wearing a blazer, but not so if you want a casual look. Also, this is a traditional fit rather than a tailored slim cut. Hope this helps.
B005NMB9PK|5|I don't usually wear Halloween costumes, but was invited to a party this year.  Thought of Flo and found this costume.  Was very pleased - looks like the real thing!
B002UD0MPI|5|This bra is a lifesaver, it's damn near impossible to find a nursing bra for the large chested woman who is also petite(34j). The clips in front are easy to unfasten and fasten. I would recommend this to anyone who is breastfeeding. My only complaint is the clips in the back, they are difficult to strap because there are so many of them, i wish it were a front close bra, life would be so much easier. Also, its been through the wash several times and its as perfect as the day i got it 7 months ago or so, i wear it everyday aside from laundry day.my only gripe is that they dont come in smaller bandwith as i am now 28i wich is not that large chested as the cupsize is relative to badwith (34D is the same cup size as a 28j to give you an idea of what im talking about) So, measure yourself properly and buy this bra, it is by far the BEST Nursing bra i've come across.
B000PQJQUY|5|I like hats but my I generally do not look good in Baseball caps. I bought this because I was planning to go on hiking trip and needs headware. I loved this prod it. The hat fit well, it looked good and did its job well (keeping sun and rain out of my eyes). I definite buy if you like hats.
B002R0FA9W|4|Most children that fit in to this leotard are still wearing diapers. The fact that there is no button crotch was frusterating but other than that, it feels nice, looks great and fit well on my 2 year old!
B000CSVOBY|2|The material's good, but the suit runs way too small.  I ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements, but all my wobbly bits are poking out.  I don't think I could wear this out in public!  Not for curvy women!!
B00DOO42LM|5|Adorable
B003DCZ56G|2|I was skeptical about buying this item but i the more i looked at the picture the more my mind changed. it came in on time but when i tried it on the first thing i noticed was it ran small i usually wear a large but i ordered this n xtra large to b safe but i fit me like a small!!! it doesnt add that much on!!!! my butt isnt small but i just wanted a little more padding!!! this DOES NO HELP WHATSOEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RUNAWAY
B000VZRPJI|4|The shirt is very good, but a little lighter weight then expected. Over all a good buy
B00GGAGFY8|5|Love it. Fits and washed well.
B00NBOA6S8|3|It's a nice, comfy shirt but the white is not bright white. It is dull, almost dirty looking.
B00KHNZGJK|3|Overall its OK. Fits just fine, but the material is kind of scratchy. and if you have a larger chest I do not recommend this for you. I have a small B, im about 5'6, 130 and it fits well. It's SUPER see through also, so if you are trying to look modest... probably not for you as well. Overall tho, it was worth the price!
B00FHMEVW4|3|I thought this top would fit and look better in person.  I knew it was a junior top when I purchased it, but I liked the one-arm design of the top.  When I received it, it looked and fit like a shirt for a teeny-bopper...I didnt like it at all.  I immediately returned it.
B00CZ50GWA|4|Very cute and nice color.  The swim diaper fit very well on her.  It doesn't loose it's shape and color after wash.
B00O21WNRG|4|Cute shirt, somewhat small though
B00GW423MG|5|a totally hilarious and comfortable christmas sweater. nothing can beat home alone, except maybe a home alone themed christmas sweater.
B000WTMGR4|4|great pants, however they have a visible elastic band on the side.  This can be very embarrassing if you do not plan on wearing a belt with these pants.  Also, the elastic provides a hole in the side of the pants so my belt sometimes get stuck in the whole when I am getting dressed in the morning for work.
B00N9ZHYCU|5|nice
B0073MLZ70|5|This is a good wallet and at a great price. Highly recommended.
B00M6FHRAS|5|Great shirt, great price. Fit as expected.
B0032FPQEU|5|Cool!
B004A7XY84|4|Good comfortable drawers.  Laundry day or just &#34;I want to be comfortable&#34; knickers.  Good quality.  The colors are very close to the picture.
B006QOIMM2|5|Great product. It is nice and warm. It seems like it a little water resistant as well which is great.
B003OUVQEC|4|These are excellent dresses.  My 2 year old loves them!  We made the mistake of drying one in the dryer and it did shrink (almost 2\\"!) so definitely a line dry item!  The tight legging pants fit perfect, however, the flare leg pants are a little long.
B003KYSSVQ|5|excellent packaging and prompt delivery, very good, my son likes
B00519PQTK|5|My husband loved this t shirt. It was a birthday present that he identified as funny and unique. Very good quality
B0008JFAJE|5|Great fit on my 12 year old and very good quality.
B00P1J33NG|5|awesome vest my husband loved it
B00ADHGJZ0|5|I'm 5'3/ 115 lbs and I was concerned about some other reviews I read saying that the sizing runs small. I needn't have worried. The size S I ordered fits wonderfully. The fabric is thicker than I expected; soft and oh-so-comfortable. The shipping was faster than I anticipated, too. It's too bad that everything is a bit overpriced, but that's my only complaint. I will definitely be buying more from this seller.
B00EHL2EJI|5|Joy likes these pajamas. They are very comfortable.
B00DRDXJUK|5|excellent very good
B005HNZDLG|5|These pants fit amazing!  Not too long, not too short.  Being 6 feet tall, it's hard to find dress pants that are long enough, but these are PERFECT!  They are a little tight through the thighs just like a lot of the other reviews say.  I would recommend these pants for any working mother who is expecting.
B007P0HFUG|3|They were significantly smaller than the jean variety of the same size and cut. I would order one size up
B00G4CUFG2|5|Purchased this wrap/robe for my daughter in law. Absolutely wonderful, soft plush wrap. Would definitely purchase again!
B0089XS3JU|3|But still a nice shirt.  In retrospect, I'd have probably ordered a 1X instead of a 2X but then I haven't washed it yet either. It's great with a long black skirt.
B00WO8D6UC|5|Loved this movie especially the church scene! People comment as well lol!
B00E006A46|5|Great shirt
B00FK8JUMQ|3|ooooooh beth anne
B0050AFXGQ|5|its as described , also the size chart was very accurate and helpful , , i have to mention the colors is perfect
B00CQ88YJ8|5|This t-shirt Looks great, fits great and feels great! The color was what i expected and materials is great. Will buy m
B0056Y338Q|4|Good.
B0018T0KAW|2|I bought a pair of 518's from Amazon and when I got them, they looked so cheap and the hemming was horrible.  According to levi.com, amazon.com is NOT an authorized seller of Levi's jeans, which means you are apt to get a fake. It's not hard to tell. The fabric is a good place to start, and the fit. I sent them back and of course, I got a refund, but I just wanted people to know they may not be getting what they think they paid for.
B00M0JRDPO|5|Wonderfully soft, warm, and toasty!
B00DQT738O|3|Bought the 6 for my 3 year old...and its already snug.
B004X67H6W|5|Wear this all the time ...quality hat for NCIS fan. Very well made. Now have had it for summer fall and now winter... Still looks new! Quality and worth what we paid for it.
B00KNRV6JO|3|Ok
B007E6A5NA|5|I am not even sure there are words for how much I love this top!  It is really sexy, without seeming overly so.  Definitely love every top I have gotten from PattyBoutik, but this is hands-down my favorite.
B00EP1FSUM|5|I was having some back pain from my oversized wallet and decided to down size, I left out everything I didn't need and only kept the must have items. This little number holds everything I need to have with me, it is well made of real leather and it works well in front pocket as well as rear.
B00HXRUMDS|5|Very cute underwear, my grand daughter loves them
B000HTJ0ZU|5|When I bought these shorts, I knew exactly the perfect fit and cut. The material is great and fresh. I would recommend these shorts for sure!
B005RX140K|4|Which is important if you have a cold or have to blow you nose repeatedly for some other reason.  The fabric is thick and substantial.  I like it for outdoor sports during which my nose runs constantly.
B008LWW43U|5|I enjoy wearing dickies clothes for work. for me,  they last all year then some. plus they are more choices here then at the box stores.
B00462QA8Y|5|it's holding up well to my husband's abuse.  has a center area for pictures of his adorable son!!    good buy.
B00MHLC2Y2|1|Seller sent me socks, not tights, and then argued with me that it was correct. If you want tights that look like thigh high socks, do not order these. They will send you actual cotton socks.
B00IXDCSFQ|5|Definitely a good purchase it's warm comfortable and looks good.
B0042INVCU|5|Great quality. Fits very well. Logo hasn't faded after 2 washes.
B00O83ZB2C|5|Got this for my niece. She loves it. She's 5'6, 135 lbs. I got her an XL since she's apparently a size 12. It fit her just right.
B00CV43Y60|4|nice bra. It fits well, but even if it does hold my girls up and high.... They still bounce when I run. Plus it gives the mono boob. It's ok for the price. But don't really expect high impact performance from it.
B0018ON482|3|I prefer a zipper.
B003ZW8D2W|4|Ordered for work out - these are okay.
B0018OL2S6|5|I'm always reminded of The Blind Side when the Sandra Bullock character takes Micheal shopping and they tell her he needs &#34;bigger and taller&#34; when I shop for my son.  He is 6'5 and 300+. Something I'll never understand when shopping for jeans is that the bigger the waist size the shorter the length.  These were a Christmas gift and quite honestly these are the first jeans that fit him perfectly.  He actually looked like he had lost weight because he didn't have to wear them so low in an attempt to make them appear longer. The price was great.  Levis never go out of style.  I will definitely be getting more!
B008BA8J04|5|It was exactly what my grandaughter needed..  She has a bad back and the weight of the baby was pulling.  This took the pressure off.
B00JXWC34M|5|It's adorable!  Has just the right peak.  Perfect for the beach and walking.
B00IYBHCQ2|2|That was a men's cut shirt so it's too big and awkward to work in. Should not be advertised as a woman's shirt. It's Hanes so it should be priced lower
B0085PP3W2|5|This pin was exactly as I expected.  I bought this as a gift for someone who is into car shows and he absolutely loved it!
B00KZ0QB62|4|Nice, soft, comfortable. A little thin. Would love to see these in patterns or stripes not just solids. Will buy again.
B00WRVDLII|5|My daughter loved it.
B00JFCF9GO|4|Simply put: all women are shaped differently. I've been a Natori customer for a few years now and not all of their bras fit exactly the same, but it's still the most reliable brand I've come across.  This one is a keeper for me. There are pros and cons, but I think it's worth it.  Cons: The bra fits wide. The wire is just a bit too far back. Not too long but not quite set right. If there was a 30DDD instead of just the 32DD I would reorder. If you can, order a band size down and a cup size up. You'll be much happier with the fit. I'm religiously a 32DD with Natori.  Also. The poking of the clasp is a little noticeable. I've not had the chance to sew a flap in, but I twist and move a lot at work, and I found it to be a bit of a nuisance. Easily fixed tho.  Pros: It's just as pictured. And it's the Natori quality I expected.  It has decent support. I've the problem of it not touching my breastbone too as others have reported, but if it did I think the clasp would bug me more. I prefer this fit for this style because I don't see a loss in support. I mean, I've got stuff to hold up and I need all the help I can get.  It's also very breathable. Great for the warmer months coming on. That's why I bought it. And if you have a racerback tie, the front clasp makes the transformation really easy. Easy on and off. Which is another reason I bought it. Bring on the tank tops!  For me, this will serve its purpose and then some. The minor nuisances are fixable or less concerning to me. I've worn if for a couple days and I really like it. Hope this helps!
B00I7YKTZW|4|The material is bright and the size chart was exactly right. I used this as part of a Harley Quinn costume and painted part of it black. It looked perfect! The only complaint I have is that the buttons are just slightly unaligned. It is not the sturdiest bone but it will make a great costume. It is flattering and comfortable. It gets a little hot after wearing it for a while, but I got a lot of compliments on it. I definitely recommend this product!
B00JN1TMG0|5|thank you !!! good saree :)
B0080NICOK|2|Did not fit well
B003XPHVR4|5|I love these jeans!  Super fit & so comfortable!  They wash well and the waistband doesn't curl over.  Planning to order more.
B007HOT7FQ|4|I really like the product, but wished I had ordered a smaller size.  I was quite pleasantly surprised, as this was truly the size that was stated, unlike other clothing items that I have had in the past, that always ran quite small.....  I do plan on ordering similiar items of this line, but will order much smaller...
